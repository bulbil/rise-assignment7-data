IN writing this hiilory of niy Iife,t 
feck not, as many of myTcx do, for 
that' immortal glory wnich is'tp he 
acquired by virtue of the prcfi } if ^ 
1 aim at any advantage frbmtKefe my * 
labours, it is principally that of inftruft-^ 
ing my little daughter, who at prefcnt is 
not at the age of maturity, but, by thefc 
memoirs, I hope, will learn how to a6t 
with diicretion when fhe arrive? to it ; 
and if my defign ihouid be attended 
wjtl^ fu^cefs, I ibail think myfelf amply 
recompenfed, and that my time has not 
been fpent in vain. But, let that be as

-This diiSlate of nature eiicreafed in me 
every year ; and though fometimes di- 
yerted from ferious reflection by child- 
Uh amufements, I began to confider ma^ 
.turdy on the nature of my conditio>i, 
.The other young ladies were frequently 
.vifited by their near relations and per?- 
fons of quality j for my part, I faw no- 
body : nevertheless my growing vanity 
flattered me that I was not inferior to 
the nobleft of them in point of birth* 
1 was often in fufpenfe how I was born, 
'and what in time might be my condi- 
tion : my fpirits were opprefled with a 
. variety of new ideas, and to my forn^er 
uninterrupted tranquility fucceeded the 
. anoft tormenting inquietude. [ 
Not knowing who viqrc my relation/^ 
,»nd having neither friends or, oaren^s 
upon wliom by nature I could depend, 
^r^'the thoughts of what was to become of 
me hereafter gave me great uneafinei^. 
The eoycrnefs, a woman of fienfc and 
experience, was no firaiiger to thote 
tumults in n^y mind; Ihe giieffed the 
motive, but, without defiring to know 
it from me, pru/dently endeavoured tp 
divert me from my trouble by her ex- 
traordinary tendernefs ; her noble^heart 
jftrove with her fpirit, and her obliging 
;nuinners were truly worthy of both ; 
and

and not a^day paifed ih which I dfd not

of what ih& faid ; though I ihuft c6n- 
feft it was fjjy^agreeafeli to my vanity, 
and when I^peSed on Tt , aftcrwaras, 
my curiofity greatly aiitexcntcd my coir- 
tcnt. The conftrfed idea ftiggefted to 
me by my governed of rby Idfty condi- 
fion, perfe6!'ly corrcfpbnded widr the 
grandeur and deKcaey of my tteatmettt.

be angry as pleafcd, being like a fire of 
ftraw that is foon extinguiflied, but in 
its flrft inipreffions capable of blowing 
up ever fo great a flame. All the falfc 
fteps of my life were the r<ifult of my 
natural impetuous fiery temper. All 
the fatal fconftquenccs that afterwards 
happened, derived their fource, as I 
' may fay, from my philofophical phlegm, 
to which every misfortune feems lefs 
hard than the ihame to recede from a 
falfe flep, and fhew ones felf vile not 
to be entirely unhappy. Thus I am at 
prefent, and ftich- I was in the eigh- 
teentli- year of -my age, when frefji trou- 
bles gave me new motives to know my- 
fclf befter. A letter that my governdfe

fkmt of fevemi of my trompaniontj 
** Take this, madam, fafd Ihe, it is ft

thcr fubfcription nor datcj my firft 
joy changed fuddenly into horrible con- 
fufion; this confufioa paffed from my 
fpirits to my heart, and diffiifed itfctf 
through all my nerves. I trembled from 
head to foot : I fwcat, and was like ice 
ill the fame moment. The fuperfcrip- 
tion of the letter was as follows : " To 
Madam D'ArvUe,, in the Retirement of 
J^Yignon, in Province " and the letter 
fan thus: 
Dear Daughter, 
The circumfiances^ unknown to you, 
that oblige me leave you where you are, 
fervq Qnlyjp c^reafe iq me the defire 
of feeti^g you; Ti^ie does nqt pfrmit 
it me at ptefentj .iludy therefore to 
cultivate thofe noble talents nature has 
given you, and render your age more 
worthy of my defires. The tendernefs 
^f a mother mak^es me deiire a line in 
anfwer to this; you will not deny it 
me. I , (hall no t omit smy thing that can 
contribute to your education. Don't 
let vain curioiity torment you to know 
me. Wait ps^tiently for the dayj nor 
can I tell you how far it is oC With 
this you'll receive one hundred piftdes 
to difpofe of as you pleafe. Love me -,

I read aver and over this tetter with 
incredible, furprize. To wonder fuc- 
fceeded agrtation of heart ; and this was 
fo violent that I had not ftrength to 
ftahd upright, but fell upon the bed 
without uttering a word, and, with eyes 
fwelling with tears and turning here 
'and there feeking who* would clear up 
my do<jbts, I to6k the letter again in 
iny hand and then tlmcw it upon tht 
bed, as though I was infcniible of my 
grief. I called reafon to my affiilance 
for motives to cahn niy fpirits, but siU 
in vain ; and every tho^ht, every con* 
iiderfttibn, evoiy objeft prefenfled a fid-

. deceive taie. After two hours profomid 
rcfle^^ion I knew nothing certaih, onlv 
that I had a mother who did not refute 
letting me know that I was her child. 
In this ftate my govemefs furprized 
nie, who caine cxprefly intd my cham-

the bed, fate down very lovingly upon 
the fide of it, faying, Pray, Madam,

jpeafonbiit every' thing -feemed obfcu're, 
aiid the leaft ftiadow feemed to me 'a 
riddle that r did not undcrftahd the half 
of. With 6ne arm refting on my toilet, 
I was making fome refleiftions on their 
cpntrarities, when the door (which was 
fill] ihut) opening with impetiiofity, 
there entered a' young German girl that 
4tbput fire years had been my waiting- 
maid : her name was Celiftina, and 
fte returned with an anfwcr to fome lit- 
tle affairs of no confequence that I had 
lent her about betimes in thf morning. 
She was fo well acquainted with* xny 
temper, and fo attentive an obfervtr of 
the Icafi coinmotioh in me^ that ihe im- 
' ' inediatelj 
I 
( 13 ) 
mediately pcrcclired my agiUtiori. She 
was going to aik me the caufe; but, ob* 
ferving it, I thought it was bdft to (hut 
her mouth by prevemion. peliilinat

In the lume of wohder. can be the 
caufeof fo great an alteration? Ahl 
if you did but know, faid I, dear Ce* 
iiiiina, it is hardly ten minutes ago that 
hearing Madam Termes call me from 
the garden betcwr, I opened At windovr 
io fee what ihe w^ntM, and there flew 
out of the window the moft beautiful 
bird I ever iaw in my life: I don't 
know how it came into my r<»om, nor 
do I know who brought it here; but I 
know very well that I would give anjr 
thing in the world it had not jgot away. 
If that is ally ikld Celifttna, make ycfur« 
ielf eafy^ that's a thing of little mo* 
inent^- know then— 1 will notipKiw 
any thing, added 1/ that bird givis me 
more trouble than, you can poffibly 
imagine. She went away laughing, and 
I remained contented with myiaven- 
lion, which took off her curiofity of 
j[iikii^4ne a thbufand queflions why I 
♦was in fuch trouble, and i prevented

twecn thefe troublefome perplexities I 
was caught by Cdefiina, who accofted 
me with a laugh ; Oh ! do you know.

Madam Roft,yflie that pretended to be 
your friend^ and came fo often to foe 
you? flie, they fey, ran away kft 
night from her hoiife with her loyer* 
In this ftyle flie gave me a full account 
of the ftory. From this fhe pafled to 
defcribe the train and equipage of a 
great pcrfontfge of the kingdom that 
had paired by Avignon, going to Paris* 
By the force of chat flie diverted xtvf 
thoughts fo much that I pftfled the re- 
mainder of that day pretty ^afy, andT 
ilept the facxt night lefe interrupted* 
By keeping V gathered a little mom 
ftrength, but Jxould not ftifle the me-» 
«iory of my two letters. Thofe two fe^ 
tal letters came frequently into miy 
mind : by little and /little I found my 
blood chill with fear of being Ihut u^ 
ni a nunnery. Heaven had by no 
means called me to that fttte or Kfe^ 
the example ©f fo many othen, inftcad 
4)f eafing me, ferved T)nly -to &ightea 
«ie ihe more. From tbcncc I found J

nee to think for mjftlf. The qu&t 
hours of the night, the moft remote 
part of the houfe, and the filence of 
this ray folitude, invited me to call to 
my aifiilance my moft mature thoughts, 
to determine what part I ought to take* 
If I thought of fuch a life as this, it 
was uimg myfelf with violence : to my 
fiery and lively temper, the moft extra« 
vagaiu refolutions had nd hoiror ii> 
them«. After thinking a long time, I 
found myfelf ready to undertake any 
thitig, and refolved in my heart not to 
ibend my life in a voluntary priibn. One 
day, in particular, I was walking alone 
in the mdft remote pkrt -of the garden^ 
when Madam Rennes ialuted me in the 
name of Count Termcs, adding, that 
he had enquired with great concern 
about my health. I returned her thanks 
as I ought, and I was almofi ready to 
charge her with the delivering him the 
piAmre $ but the govemefs came fud* 
denly upon us, and took me aiide, iay- 
ipg ihe wanted to fpcak with me. 
My firft fufpicion was that (he knew 
fomething of the piAure, and that flie 
was come to enquire of me about it.

I got up very early next morning to 
read over this letter, and I fotind it, as 
it ought to be, to give into the way of 
thinking of my govcrnefs.and' my mo- 
ther, I was content with my fclfj and 
it feemed to me I had done a great deal, 
having fo well diffcmbled my true fen- 
timents to delude the intentions of both 
who afted with fo little fincerify to me* 
In that firff heat'of yquth anci paffion, 
I judged I had treated them as they 
merited : but how foon did I find that 
the paths of youth are indifcreet and 
flippery, and that Iwith thefe arts de- 
ceived my felf more than others. I car- 
Vol. I. D rjed 
( 26 ) 
ncd the letter that fame morning to the^. 
Sovernefs, and defired her to feal it, not 
oubting in the ieaft but (he would have 
curiofity enough to read it ; but I wax- 
o|i the other hand certain, that ihc 
would be, by that means, confirmed in 
the good opinion of nie, in which I 
had' left her the preceding day. Re- 
turning from her I met Celeftina, who 
told. me I was afked for at the gate; fo 
finding myfelf tolerably well drefled, I 
went down imniediately, without fuf- 
pe^ing who it could be that enquired 
for Hie. 
CHAP. IV. 
My firft Love with the Count af Termes. 
ON the ground floor, where I wat 
expefted, I found the Count, who 
was amufing himfelf with fome picftures 
with which it was furnilhed. At the 
fight of him my fpirits were fluttered. 
After the ufual compliments, I protefted 
that his vifit furprifed me very much. 
He moft obligingly anfwered me by 
begging an excufe for his boldnefs, and 
defiring that 1. would attribute the fault. 
to that cordial friendihip that had ren- 
dered me fo fcnfiblc of the death of his 
fifter. 
(27) 
fiftcr, and entitled me to his refpeft 
were it only through gratitude. 
My eager impatience to enter upon 
the difcourfe of my box and the pic- 
ture, did not permit that I Ihould lofc 
time in ufelefs ceremonies; but the 
Cbunt had no defire to talk of that, and 
obliged me to be the firft to introduce 
it, though abruptly. Sir, faid I, the 
mention of your lifter's death brings to 
my mind a change very extraordinary, 
that happened the other day; in this 
box,oblerve here, inftead of the pi^^urc 
of my friend I find one that exaftly re- 
fembles you. This unexpefted difcourfe 
furprifed him in fuch a manner that he 
ftarted back, and confufedly faid, in 
changing the piAure I could never have 
believed that I fhould have offended 
you. I affe<fted to be difgufted, giv- 
ing him to underftand I wanted it back; 
whether he thought fo or no, to exempt 
himfelf from taking it back again, he 
made a low bow and departed. Con- 
trary to my inclination he deprived me 
of the pleafure of his converfation; and 
when I retired to my chamber, I re- 
proved myfelf bitterly. H-^w much the 
pafEons are altered by the obje<Ss ! I 
had afted in a manner confiftent with 
my age and chara<fter, yet my delicacy 
D 2 feemed 
>C 28 ) 
fcenicd to be nnfeafonablc ; and as I was 
already touched at heart, I fell unex- 
pecftedly into a profound melancholy. 
I don't intend by this to juftify my 
weaknefs in the eyes of the public, I 
am condemned by myfelf; in thofe 
cijrcumftances I ought to have made bet- 
ter ufe of my reafon. The uncertain- 
ty of my birth demanded quite other- 
wife than a love engagement ; but I am 
a woman ; I was young, nor was I the 
only one that had began to, love at fo 
tender an age. To be fenfible of love, 
it is eri^gh there are men ; the begin- 
nings are flattering and fweet : thofc 
that have not experience of the world 
cannot forefee the effects. Among the 
men there are faces that enchant one at 
firft fight. Add to this, that after hav- 
ing feen the Count often, occafionfed by 
liis coming to fee his fitter, I had over- 
come all little punftilios 5 and I don't 
know how, but all my tendernefs for 
her returned to fpeak in his favour. 
The grief at having loft fo fine an op- 
portunity of letting him know my heart, 
deprived me of my fleep and quiet: 
The day following I was ftill bufied in 
thefe thoughts, when, contrary to all 
my cxpeilations, a poor woman of the 
jneighbourhood broi^^ht mc, in the 
najnc 
( «9) 
name of the Count of Tcrmcs this 
letter : 
** Madam, 
If you have any ftntiments of com- 
paffion for the picture that remains in 
your hands, I ihould confole myfelf for 
the lofs of a lovely fifter with the hopes 
of having found another in your per- 
fon. I Ihall prefer ve hers ; be content 
that I remember both her and you. 
Forget me, however, if your heart 
will fuffer it J but be permaded, that 
the hope of being in your's, fan only 
make me amends for a lofs:in which you 
yourfelf have fo great a Ihare. I am, 
with all refpe<ft) 
Your moft humble, 
and moft obedient Servant, 
Termes." 
This letttr entirely changed me from 
what I was ; before I read it, I told the 
perfon that brought it to return in two 
hours for the anfwer: theanfwering it did 
not coft much violence to my modefty ; 
as the Count treated me like a fifter, it 
juftified, in fon^e meafure, my forward- 
nefs ; I continued to anfwer him in the 
fame ftyle, and wrote him. That as 
things flood on the fame teruis by him 
D 3 men- 
( 30 ) ^ 
mentioned, I Ihould cftecm myfelf ho- 
jioured, if he thought me worthy of 
any part of .that eftcem and coiifidera- 
tion that he had had for a filler, who 
wither by him or me could be enough 
eftecmed. The meffenger returned 
to me at the precife hour ; I gave her 
the letter, which Ihe received, with fo 
much affiduity to carry it immediately, 
that I judged that day would not pafs 
without the Count's coming again to fee 
me. Here he is, in fa^, in about an 
jhour after, with a laughing and intre- 
pid air^as if he was certain of the con- 
queft he meditated. How great is my 
felicity, fays he fmiling, to find you fo 
ferene, after the difplqafure I occafion- 
ed you without intending it ? to a foul 
like your's, that judges rightly, reafon 
. is not wanting to juftify my aflur^nce: 
your letter to me gave me great confo- 
lation, making me hope,,that I have 
found in you one half of my felf ; aixl 
fhis hope alone is enough that I Ihould 
excufe your cjifobliglng aufterity. It's 
eafy to. be imagined, that by what I had 
faid I could not leffen in him the heat 
of thefc his amorous hopes. Two hours 
of converfation were more than enough 
to transform a brother and fitter by 
name only, into two paiBonate lovers. 
Our 
( Jt ) 
Our love, more than fraternal, was no 
longer ftifled in our breads ; after this 
enfucd reciprocal declarations, and the 
moft finccre proteftations ; nor Ihould 
we have finiihcd fo foon if Madam 
Kennes, whom I had not feen all that 
day, had not furprifci and interrupted 
us. I faw rage painted in her counte- 
nance, at having found me in a clofe 
converfation with 1-cr coufm. 1 he 
Count, who alfo faw it, chained im- 
mediately his language to take off any 
fufpicion, by (ell-ng her, that (he feem- 
cd much troubled, and thit he defired 
to know the reafon that had occaiioned 
it. She guefled the nwtive of his com- 
ing, and without diffimulation gave 
him to underftand, that fo loi>g a vifit 
Ihe did not think wdl of. The Count 
began fb joke, the better to perfuadc 
her of his indifference in regard to me ; 
but feeing he did it without the defired 
effeft, he departed in a few moments, 
and Ihe went off laughing. I did not 
take any notice of her behaviour, be- 
caufe I was too much overcame with 
joy at having gained fo much ground 
in a country where I wanted to reign. 
To apologize for my weaknei's, I 
muft fay, thlt the Count of Tcrmes 
was an amiable Chevalier, that he had 
merit. 
(32) 
^nierit, fpirit, and virtue; and that I 
would very willingly have given him 
an abfolute dominion over my heart, if 
I had bren my own niiftrefs. Madam 
Rennt s began from that day to look with 
jealous tyes on all our motions ; but 
in fpite of her vigilance, we did not 
fee each other lefs than three or four 
times a week for the two following 
months. 1 he governefs was foon ap- 
'prized of our friendfhip ; Ihe gave mc 
to underftand that Ihe Ihould be better 
pleafed if I could difpenfe with thefe 
vifits lefs frequently, without however 
telling the Count that this came from 
her. I received thefe orders with all re- 
fpeft, but anfwered, that I would not 
break it to that gentleman fo fuddenly ^ 
that I fliould infenfibly difpofe him to 
comply f and that this civil regard was 
owing to a perfon of his charafter, 
that 1 had been acquainted with fo long 
a time. My love did not permit me to 
proceed with that caution that Was pre- 
fcribed to me : I ftill continued to re* 
ceive the vifits of the Count as ufual ; 
I confided in the meafures already ta- 
ken, to be able to fee each other with- 
out danger ; and all was truly concert- 
ed, that I fliould be his wife ; when all 
on a fudden it was intimated to me^ not 
to 
(33) 
to fee him any more ! Let thofe ima- 
ginr, who know what love is in the 
heart of a girl, what was then my fitu- 
ation, and what ideas came immediate- 
ly into my mind. 
The order feenjed to me a certain 
prefage that they already thought of 
Ihutting me up by main force in a 
cloyften The diftance of the Count 
cut off every advice and affiftance j be- 
fides, I was agitated with the apprehen- 
fion of that violence the Count would 
commit on himfelf : it feemed to me, 
that the not feeing him was already the 
firft ftep to his entirely forgetting me ; 
and the fole fufpicion of this fatal for- 
getfulnefs, reduced me to the utmoft 
defperation. On the other hand, I dared 
not fhew the leaft fign of my inward 
troubles, not to confirm the fufpicions 
of thofe that attentively obfcrved me. 
The conftraint I put on my (elf is in- 
credible : when I was alone, I deftroy- 
ed myfelf in tears ; when any one ar- 
rived, I affefted gaity and fprip;htlinefs 
that coft me the greateft reluftance. 
To my fuccour I called my m<>ft feri- 
ous reflexions ; I painted my loVer as my 
ideas were, a perfon of honour ; and 
that, in fpight of fo many contrarieties,^ 
he would never leave to love me : I fi- 
gured 
( 34 ) 
^red to myfelf, that my fpirits were 
luperior to all proofs; and, with the 
■ example of a thoufand love-adventures 
read in books, I took my prefent cala- 
mity for an infallible fign of my being 
one day happy. Had any one told me 
how far fuch a day was off, and how 
long I had to figh, perhaps I had beem 
more wife. No one could penetrate to 
know what pafled within me; my coun- 
fellors were, defpair and love. The 
Count'knew nothing of mefortwo weeks 
afterwards, nor could I rifle his having 
any news of me: from whence all my 
refleftions finillied, by feconding the 
. impiilfes of my nature, and furnilhing 
myfelf with virile courage a^inft all 
the caprices of my perverfe fortune. 
One day, in which I found myfelf 
more than ever difpofed to undertake 
any thing not to lead a life worfe than 
death, Celittina took me apart and put 
into my hand a billet from the Count, 
which was not fealed, and contained on- 
ly thcfe few words : 
" Madam, 
I have no more time than to advife 
you of my immediate depart are for the 
army in Italy. The orders that I have 
received neither admit of delay or re- 
ply. 
( 36) 
ly. Wherever I am, I fhall be always 
our's. Preferve yourfelf faithful, and 
ope." 
This news was to me like a clap of 
bunder. The hand-writing was the 
^ount de Tcrmcs; but the ftylc, the 
Tcvity, the want of the name, a de- 
parture fo precipitate and unexpected— 
Itogether was a myftcry to me of which 
did not comprehend one word. I in- 
erro^ted Celiflina how (he had got 
hat paper ; (he had nothing more to 
ell me, than that llie had it from a friend 
)f hers that had it from the Count's own 
land two days before. Then he is de- 
)arted! cried I, almoft befidc my- 
elf, he is departed ! nor may I hope to 
ee him any more ! This ftroke, I need 
lo longer doubt, comes from my mo- 
her; (he takes from me, by her fecret 
nanagemcnt, a hu(band, becaufe (he 
vould have me buried in a cloyftcr^ but 
lo, it (hail not be fo, if it (hould coft 
ne my life^ Thus I went on, not 
knowing what I faid ; my furious paf* 
ion had taken away my fenfes, nor did 
[ perceive that, by Celiftina's being 
prefent, I betrayed a fecret which, till 
that time, I had kept with fo much re- 
gard : the ftonc was (Jung, nor did it 
iignify 
( 36 ) . ^ ,. 
fignify witholding my arm, as it would 
go where deftin'd. By thefe few words 
Celiftina comprehended all. I had al- 
ready a thoufand proofs of her fidelity; 
but then, with tears in her eyes, Ihe 
Ihewed me in fucha manner her heart, 
that I had not the leaft. motive to repent 
of my having admitted her to my con- 
fidence ; in order to confole me, Ihe ad- 
vifed me to hope that I fhould be one 
day happy. I Ihall be, anfwered I re- 
folutely; it Ihall be, dear Celiftina, if 
you will have it fo. My felicity is not 
to be hoped for in this place ; to find it, 
it is neceflary that I Ihould be put at li- 
berty J and if you don't affift me in this 
great undertaking, prepare yourfelf to 
fee me die a defperate death. Thefe 
^words, pronounced by me with a viva- 
city fuperior to my fex, made fuch an 
impreffion on her that flie did not know 
how to anfwer me better than by throw- 
ing herfelf at my feet, clofely embracing 
iTiy knees, and protefting that for me 
fhe would give her own life. In raifing 
her from the ground, I kifs'd her with 
. the love of a fitter ; and to profit Qf her 
intents, fo much in my favour, I im- 
mediately communicated to her my 
thoughts, and charged her with the 
neceffity there was to put them into 
execution. 
( 37 ; 
«ecution. 1 gave her all I had that 
was valuable, in deaths, jewels,' and fil- 
ver, that llie might fell them privately ; 
and in a few days fhe brought me tfiree 
hundred pift'olcs, which, added to the 
hundred I had received by order of my 
mother, enlarged my heart, and put 
me in fuch a ftate tliat I did not care for 
all the world. This being done, I gave 
her directions to provide every things 
neceflary to drefs me in the habit of a 
man ; 1 told her that whatever remain- 
ed in my trunk, Ihould be her own, 
and that this would be a proof of my 
love and gratitude, and, at tlie fame 
time, a confolation in the necelilty I was 
under to feparatc myfelf from her. Se- 
parate yourfelf from me 1-faid ihe, cry- 
ing, this ihall never be ; I don't know, 
dear Madam, what your intentions are, 
but I very well know my own fixed refo- 
kition : wherefoever your fteps are turn- 
ed to, I will follow you; with you I 
may fay I have been brought up, and 
with you I will die ; and if you have the 
heart to leave me behind, you will be 
unworthy of that felicity I wifh you, 
and whicji you will procure by my 
means, at the price of all my future 
happincfs. I prevented her from going 
on at this rate, with intention that Ihe 
Vol. I. E . migl t 
( 38 ) 
might make rcfledions more ferious, 
and more fuitable to my reputation. I 
was fenfible that my fortune and honour 
were at ftakc, and I could never have 
enjoyed a quiet hour, had 1 been in any 
means acceflai'y to her ruin : more un* 
happy myfelf could not be, whatever 
happened to mc ; but I dreaded the con- 
fequcnces of involving her in my mif- 
fortunes. Thefe my obje<5lions were all 
to no purpofe, Celiftina infifted upon 
going with me, and, after various argu- 
ments, for and againft, it was at leijgt h 
concluded between us that we fhould 
make our cfcape together ; and Ihc 
took upon her the care of difpofing 
things in a proper manner, that our 
flight Ihould not be either difcovered or 
interrupted. 
C H A P, V. 
My Flight frcm the Convent of Avlgmn 
in' Man* s Ap far el. 
I Am now come to that extraordinary 
part of my life which was the foun* 
d^tion ot a thoufand afflidions, and 
, which formed the extravagant thread 
of thefe my uncommon adventures, 
refplved on by me in the heat of my 
vehement paflion, and carried into exe- 
cution 
(39) 
cutlon in cool blood with as much in- 
differeiKc and refolution as if the confc- 
quences were quite immaterial. My 
birth was a fecret, my education very 
auftere, my deftiny undoubtedly con- 
trary to my inclinations j a mother un- 
known, a politic govcrnefs, a lover 
loft, a cloyfter waiting for me, were 
reafons that would juftify my proceed- 
ing to all the world, if I was not the 
firft to condemn it, that it might not 
ferve others for an example : at prcfent 
I know that by fuch a precipitate un- 
dertaking fortune conduced '.vhich way 
fhe plcafed j but perhaps Ihe would have 
guided me ftill by ways lefs fatal and 
dangerous, nor ought the happy fuc- 
ccfs of a blameable undertaking to ex- 
cufc the raihnefs of my conduA. 
In the fpace of a few days Celiftina 
had put every thing in order that was 
needful for our departure, and came to 
advife with me on the manner in which 
I ought to aft in the execution of our 
defign. At day-break I was to go down 
into the garden, where Ihe was to have 
ready a ladder for me to fcale the walls : 
at the gates being opened we were to go 
out of the city and to walk to Sorgues, 
about a league and half diftant troni 
Avignon, where a returned chaife for 
E a , Lyons 
( 40 ) 
Lyons was to wait for us,, for which (lie 
had agreed to pay fifteen livres. In our 
iituatton nothing could fall out better ; 
I killed and embraced her with joy at 
having fo well feconded my intentions.; 
I will, faldCeliftina, in the mean thne 
tell the family that you find yourfelf 
much indifpofed^ and defire them not 
to wait for you at fuppcr ; but that I 
will take fomething for you to your own 
chamber: fo that if they fhould not fee 
you betimes to-morrow morning, it 
may prevent their immediate fufpicion. 
By this contrivance no one came up to 
difturb me in my apartment, Celifti- 
na went away pretty late, telling them 
at the gate that ihe (liould not return, 
as flic propofed to tarry that night 
with a near relation of hicrs at the poiut 
of -deatli. Whatever I had that was va- 
luable was taken by liulc and little out 
of the houfe and fold. The night 
fcemed very tedious ; but at laft the 
moment arrived that I fo much wiihcd 
for to be out of my prifon. At the fii il 
appearance of the morning I jumped 
from the bed, where I had lain all night 
in my cloaths,and walking foftly down, 
took the way to the garden. At the 
place appointed I found Cdiftina, who 
was already mounted upon the top of 
the 
( 41 ) 
the wall and was there waiting for me- 
She then drew up the ladder by which 
llie had got up on the out-fide, and let 
it down for me who was within, that I 
might get upon the wall : I did fo with 
incredible haAe, and one after the 
other, we defcended by the fame ladder 
into the ftreet, where a relation of Ce- 
leftina, who was already In the iccret, 
took me in her arms, and immediately 
conduiSted us to her houfe. This enter- 
prize was a thing of great moment for 
a woman, for a young woman of my 
age, who had been educated under the 
moft ftri<5t dtfcipline. Perhaps it was 
either the unexpe^ed joy of feeing 
myfelf at liberty, or thro' fear of being 
caught on my flight, I was taken with 
fuch a heart-beating that I trembled 
from head to foot, as if I dreaded eve- 
ry moment to be my laft. Having re- 
vived my fpirits with a glafs of cordial, 
with which our friend was opportunely 
provided, Celeftina began to drefs my 
hair after the faihion that men wear it. I 
drefled myfelf alfo in man's apparel not 
very gay, but of a good taftc and genteel. 
She put on herfelf a drefs after the 
Englifh faihion for travelling; and 
made me give her my arm, as if I 
kad been her gallant, and after bidding 
£ 3 adieu 
( 42 ) 
adieu' to pur conjfidaiit, we walked haf- 
tily to, get out of the city. I'he fir ft 
gate that opened was that mar the ri- 
ver 5 we arrived there juft as the draw- 
bridge was. letting down, and piffed 
flowly over withoyt Icing taken vro^ 
ticc of by any body. VVe went out 
into the country as if with deHgn lo " 
take a cool walk in the morning ; and>. 
when there was no danger of our being, 
obferved,. we haftened on, taking the 
dircft road to Sorgues. I walked fo 
faft, that Celifiina could hardly keep 
up with me ; Madam, fays lhe> laugh- 
ing, fince you came from Avignon 
you have wings to your feet. It is nccef- 
ary to have them, I replied, that we may 
Bot be overtaken : 1 think I have *the 
goyernefs at my back, and feel her car- 
rying me by force back again to my 
cell. Here f fiopped, and being feized 
with a fpirlt of liberty, which was all 
the effc^ of my weakoefs, I called on 
hcRven for its curfes on my head if 
ever it (hould come into, rjiy, thouglits. 
to return back to my prifon, or liften 
to any one who Ibould advife me to it. 
Celiftina believing I meant her, aflurcd 
me, that fhe never /hould have fpoke 
of it, and that the receding was unbe- 
coming a female philofopher. By this 
time 
( 43 ) 
time the fun was riien, and ihe, giv- 
mgriiie a glance from head to foot, be- 
gan to laugk without my kiiowirig th^: 
rrafi)ii A find huihand ! fai 1 .<ht% Itill 
laughing, a fine hufband .that I have- 
found without looking for one !; What 
think you, added I, don't I ; i\iakc a 
fufllciaat figure in thj? drefs ? The fi- 
gure is good, replied ihe,/but for a-, 
hpflband the figure is. not enough rather 
cafe is really extravagant, thati ono girl 
fhould be hufband to airothtr,but in ouk 
circuinftances nothing can be thought 
of better ; befides, your difguife now 
puts you in poficffion of a liberty that 
is not familiar to our feXi you alfo 
Ihut the mouth of fcandd, .bccaufe to 
a wife in company with her^ hultand, 
and to a hulband in company with his 
mfcy all is permitted. ' Celiftina, fpoke 
10 this joking manner, but her (Extra- 
vagant idea pleafed me when more feri- 
ous; and this part of being thought; 
man and wife wherever we went, feem- 
ed to me to be quite proper to exempt 
us from the refearches of the curious, 
and to be lefs expofed to the danger of 
being difcovered. Since it is to be fo, 
faid ihe, it is neceflary to put a name 
to the preteaded perfonage that you are 
to reprefeiot in the world, and to feign 
the 
( 44 ) 
ihc country in which you was hotiXp 
the education with which you waff 
brought up, the character that your 
family fuftains, and, laftly, the mo- 
tives you have in travelling Europe in 
company with your wife. All thefc 
precauticms were neccflary, that we 
might not vary, whenever fpeaking of 
ourfelves, and to tlude the fagacity of 
thofe that might follow us, and who, 
by private letters, or the public papers 
might get intelligence of us by parti- 
cular delcriptions. It was concluded 
between us, that I (hould pretend to be 
an Italian noble man by birth, and that 
I fhould fay I was travelling to foreign 
courts in learch of preferment ; as to 
the name that I was to take upon me, we 
were not a little embarraflcd to find one 
that was unknown to all the world, 
and by which we Ihould not put our- 
felves- in 'danger of being difcovercd : 
after much confideration it was con- 
cluded that I fliould be called Count 
Richard, and Ihe ihould paft for Ma- 
dam the Countefs, my wife. Upon 
this extravagant idea what did not Ce- 
liftina fay, and what did Ihe not do to 
divert mej Ihe afferted that all this 
falihood would coft but one word j it 
being ufual for me, in our language, to 
call 
( 45 > 
fall her my chaniber*niaid, it wa« 
enough that I omitted that word cham- 
bermaid and Ihe immediately became 
my wife : fhe added, that it was pro- 
per we ihould think of celebrating the 
nuptials, which ihe would have done 
privately for the fake of oeconomy ; 
that we could fleep together without 
fear of having any children born to aup;- 
ment the expences of the fimily. With 
fuch like dilcourfes we arrived at Sor- 
gues. Though the going on foot in- 
commoded me, I vvalked as nimble ns 
if I had fcrvcd five or fix campaign? in 
a regiment of infantry; the joy of bi- 
ing at liberty gave nic vigour; the 
hopes of bettering my coiwlition wouli 
Jiave made me walk to the Antipodes. 
About ten o'clock in th^ morning we 
arrived at Sorgues, where I found tho 
chaifc ready, and mounting it imme- 
diately we proceeded on our road. 
This was very near the hour in wliioh 
thry muft difcovcr my flight. I w ,s 
under no apprchenfion of purfuit iroju 
the convent, but pleafed myfelf with 
the reflection of what would be faid 
then jn Avignon of this affair of mine : 
I thought I faw all thefe good women 
in diforder and confufion ; fome run* 
ning 
(46) 
ning trp and down looking for me thro' 
all the houfe; others calling with a loud . 
voice the goveniefs of the place, and 
meeting her, cry out, Ah ! Madam, don't 
you know Madam D' Arvile is j^one off ? 
Ihe- is not to be found all over the 
houfe ; her rh^.mbe^r is em^ty, fomc- 
body has ctxtainly affiftcd her; llie 
niuft be followed before fhe gets too 
fiar off. The thought that pic afed me 
moft was, that of having known fo well 
how to elude their vigilance, and of 
being revenged on my mother who had 
prohibited me all commerce with the 
Count, and who, by force of fair words, 
would facrifice me to a cloyfter.to which 
heaven had not called me. Had they ta- 
ken proper methods they might eaiily 
have overtaken ns ; but knowing what 
fort of people I had to -deal with, this 
thought did not give me the leaft un- 
eaiinefs : confufion prevailed with them 
rather than prudent council; they 
vented in ufelefs talk their wonder, and 
wrangling upon the manner of the 
event, th. y ncj.^! '6ted the* remedy whtch 
they ought, iii hafte, to have laid he Id 
of: an attentive father, a man of fenfe, 
might have overtaken us before we had 
arrived at Sorgues,as we made no great 
bafte to our horfcs. Tho' I had the bol i- 
nefs 
( 47 ) 
«cfs to projcft a flight, I am debtor for 
having executed it lb happily, not fo 
much to my own f igacity a»d good tor- 
tune, as to the indolent negle<btlulncfs 
of thole wh'j lam? nt it without benefit, 
and who knew not how tu remedy it, 
as I Ihall ihcw hereafter. 
CHAP. VI. 
Mf Arrival as Lyans^ and a Refolution 
taken io traffic. 
IN the duik of the evening we arrived 
at Lyons j and, Ibme fewd lys after our 
arrival, I undcrftood by the dlfcourfe 
that my flight was public through all 
the city. It was faid, that a young 
wonian of illuftrious birth was fudden- 
Jy gone from the nunnery of Avignon, 
and that they could hear no ,news of 
her. They related the particulars of 
my flight quite contrary to what they 
were in reality ; they gave the plaineft 
tokens of my flight, and manner of 
my drefs ; and added, that fcarch had 
been made at the city gates of Avignon 
for fuch a perfon, and drcfTed in fuch a 
manner, and were aflured, that no fuch 
perfon had been feen to go out of the 
city, and that the coriimon opinion was 
that I was &x\i in Avignon, hid in fome 
par- 
( 48 ) 
f^arficular houfe ; there were alfo thofc 
that would frankly affert, that I had 
taken refuge in the Count de Tenncs's 
palace. Thus people deceive them- 
felves in their awn judgment ^ and 
whatever happens in public report is 
ever fubjed to thefe variations. They 
might feck i»eas much as they pleafed 
in Avignpn, and not have found me; 
and on the other hand, it was very true 
that they had not feen me go out of the 
city, as the changing of my drefs had 
deceived them. /It was very well that 
there only they expe(5>ed to find me, 
and did not follow me farther j but 
making the figure of a married man, 
they could not even fufpcift that there 
^as a woman, hid under my ctoaths. 
Thus we remained quiet fbmr days in 
our lodgings at Lyons, and, having 
nothing elle to employ us, we were 
continually making ferious reflexions 
on futurity. At Lyons we could not 
always remain; not having there any 
connexions we might Ibon be fufpeXed 
and found out. .. To profecute our jour- 
ney any farther, would be expenfive, 
and diminilh our' fmances every day, 
with traveiling aad thechargesofchnlfc- 
hire ; but then how could we live in this 
place, and find money to fupply our 
wants ? 
( 49 ) 
irants r from thefe thoughts, wTiich gave 
xnemuch trouble, Celiftina endeavour- 
ed to divert me, by jefting; Tou are a 
charming gentleman, fays flie to me j 
make your court to fome of thofe la- 
dies, it is impoflible but that you will 
make fome conqucft, aiid then our for- 
tune is made. There ihould be fomc- 
^ing elfe, my dear wife,, smfwcrcd I, in 
OUT cafe J few of f hofe women arc to be 
foimd that make mens fortune j and, by 
feeking for fuch, a thoufandare to be met 
with that may be our ruin; to gain their 
confidence, you muft fecond thpir hu- 
mours, and their extravagant fancies, 
and, by What I have hitherto read and 
^nderftood, will coll one a treafure. It is 
,not that fprightfinefs, good grace, and 
talents; that diflinguiih meii inthe molt 
improving converfationj but gaming, 
public Ihews, dinners, parties of plea- 
fures, and buffooneries, are the foul of ^ 
the modern tafte ; and he is mofl cfteem- 
cd who fpends moft like a fool, or by 
de^erate play ing. 
If I was to follow this trade^ of the 
five hundred piftoles whicTx I have at 
prefent, in five days J fhould not have 
n farthing J and the yain hope of an im- 
certain conquefi, would coft me a cer- 
tain Ids, Then let us think of fome- 
VoL, I. F thing 
(60) 
thing clic, replied Celiftina; iM>r will 
we depart from the maxims of fo rea* 
fonable a philofophy, which makes rae 
more and more in love with you. The 
inoney which we have is our beft friend j 
we do not expe^ them from aiiy other 
part; from this wc have Qur fuftenancc, 
and, as wc have liothing but ourfelvci 
to keep, let us expend it to fome advan- 
tage : we are in a country where com- 
. merce flouriihes, and where there are 
to be purchafed rich embroidered filks, 
both in gold and filver, and for which 
a much greater price is paid in all th.e 
cities of Europe ; let us put ourfelves 
into trade, by laying out in merchan- 
dize the major part of the money you 
have 5 we will fell them again in other 
countries, by which means the capital 
will be referved intire^ and by the pro- 
fits of the fame, as many others have 
done, we fliall defray our expences. 
This project ^as lefs dangerous than 
the other, but this alfo had its difficul- 
ties : our capital was too fmall to bring 
a profit fufficient to fupply all our ne- 
cefsities; for a lucrative trade, it re- 
quired a large fum, or great credit; 
the chief fupport of the richeft and 
moft flouriihing traders depends upon 
credit i and fuch may have in their ma- 
gazines 
( 5' ) 
gazines a capital of one hundred thou* 
fend crowns, and be ladebt half a mil- 
lion,; but they fcldom fail, becaufethey 
conftantly find frefli fupplies to main- 
tain their credit. Befides all this, faid I 
to /my wife, to trade with profit, it i% 
neceflary to know accompts, and the 
advantages in buying and felling; in 
all th(is/ we are in the dark; aiKl I 
ihould not be lefs embroird by being a 
merchant, than a phyfici^n. a lawyer, 
or a foldier. To thefe difficulties Celif- 
tina found a remedy by the example 
of many women of her acquaintance, 
who, with a very fmall beginning, were 
brcome very rich merchants ; and in-^ 
fifted that this was the beft party for us» 
She faid Ihe would fjicak of it, as a thing 
of her own, to our landlady : that Ihc 
could give her fome light in thefe af* 
fairs. I did not oppofe her defire, as I 
judged her to be a woman of art and 
cunning ; and I thought I could con- 
fide in her. Mrs. Tavenot, fo was my 
landlady called, was daughter to a rich 
merchant, and a man of credit, but 
who had failed by living too high : the 
late failure of her father had not per- 
mitted her to fijid a hiifband, fucn as 
ihe deferved : Ihe was not however de- 
bafed by her marriage, as ihe had mar- 
F 1 xied 
( 5* ) 
tied an officer with whonx flic had Iir- 
*d a little more than four years, ahdJ^ 
who was killed at the fiege of Barcelo- 
na; Sthe remained a widow,, maintaining 
herfelf by a little traffic, and by letting 
ready-furniflied lodgjnjgs to people of 
diftinflion. To her haftened Celiftina, 
and, in full confidence of her intenti* 
ens; (he received all the inftru6lions 
that were neceflary to us on that head^ 
She conducted her through all the city, 
and made her ^iCquaintcd with the rich- 
eft merchants in Lyons; ihe (hewed her 
all kinds of fluffs and iilks of different 
qualities ; (he taught her the propcreft 
method to be taken in buying, and 
where (he might fell them again; (he 
contraAed for the price of the fame ; 
upon the whole, flie made her lay out, 
in fo much goods, four hundred pif- 
toles, alTuring her, that, if (he follow- 
ed her advice, Ihc would get five hun- 
dred piftoles^ for them when ever fhc 
fold thera. While Celiftina was going 
about theie affairs^ which could not be 
difpatchcd in one day, I pafled my time 
in reading, in my ladgings^ all the good 
books that had been primed lately : two, 
among the reft, I read with incredible 
delight more than oncc; and from thefe 
I learned a great deal: the one was inti- 
tied. 
( 53 ) 
tied, " Philofophy for Women, '* 4h<* 
other, ** The Art of Thmking Well 5 ''  
the firft was wrote in French, the fecond 
in EngKlh ; and both, before I had any. 
great praftice in the world, in thefe few 
days taught me how to live. Reading 
was never any trouble to me ; but one 
day, in particular, I found I had need of 
ibme other amiifement ; and as Celifti- 
na never returned home in the day, I 
went out to pafs half an hour iri a 
coffee-houfe, a very little way dlftant 
from my lodgings; and finding at the 
door an officer, I went in with him : 
we faluted, and fate down together. 
There were, on one of the tables, the 
news-papers of the day ; the waiter pre- 
fented thebfficer with them, but he only 
ran them over, and gave them to me that 
I might divert myfelf, if I had a mind to 
read them. I ran my eye Immediately 
over them till I came to the date from 
Avignon, and there I found a long ftory 
of my flight.' By Celiftina's confidant 
many circumftanccs had been related; 
ihe had been feeii in a Jew's fliop buying 
fome mens cloaths, and they waited till . 
the Jew returned from the country, 
where he was gone for a few days, that ^ 
they might learn fome other notice more 
particular and precife. Reading this 
F 3 article 
(54) 
article In the Gazette, I gave no fign 
of furprize, though I was not at all 
quiet in my mind* There was iii the 
coffce-houfe, one of thofe people called 
politicians, who obferve w th more 
greedinefs the public paper, than they 
would the will of fome of their relati- 
ons. He adced me immediately, if L 
had made any refledion upon what was. 
from Avignon, and what was my opi** 
xiiop of that ftory ? I anfwered coolly,., 
that fuch relations as thefe were in ge- 
neral felfe, oir very much altered ^ that 
the Gazette writers, to fill up their pa- 
per, make of a fly an elephant; and. 
that if the fa£i was true of the young 
woman of Avignon, by tlie next ordi- 
nary poft there would be fomething 
more, becaufc Ihe could not be able to 
keep herfelf long hid. I thought by 
this, that I had Ihut the mouth of this 
news-monger i but he alked me a 
thoufand queftions, as if he had known 
by his fmell that I was woman : as good, 
fortune for me would have it, a coach 
flopped at the door of the colfee-hpufei 
I feced about to the perfon th^t was

A ^riendjhip ttmiradii by mi at Lyons 
with Mr. D'^rcori.. 
TH E perfon falutcd by mc at- his 
coming out of His coach, was a, 
young gentleman of about twenty-five 
years of age; of an open air, and oblig- 
ing carriage. He returned my falutc 
without ihewing himfelf the Icaft fur-- 
prifed, and as if I had been, his friend, 
for many years.. After having ordered, 
the coachman.to return in an hour,, he 
took me by the hand, and, making mc 
fit down, placed himfelf op pofite tome.. 
Seeing the papers upon the table, he. 
aiked me if I had read theni, and what, 
news there was ? Nothing, Sir, faid I,^ 
but an. account of the flight of a cer* 
tain girlifrom a nunnery at Avignon, of, 
which account I. am' very doubtful,, be- 
caufe the writers of the Gazettes, in 
tjiefe barren times of news, catch at any. 
thing for the fake OP hkving fomcthing. * 
to write. As to that, replied he, the 
fa<5 is very true; I. have feveral letters. 
from Avignon. thaJt mejntion it : whicJi. 
alfq fay, that jpreifijE^ orders arc fent e vcr 
C56 y 
yy where, that all poffiblc fearch "is to 
be made for that young lady, and that 
they are to apprehend her,, and keep 
her, wherever ihe is found. For my 
part, laid he, there is no danger that I 
Ihall ever take a thought to look after 
her, or become a fpy, if I could find 
her. They pretend to fay, that (he has 
taken the road to Marfeilles, to embark; 
on board fome fhip for Holland. We 
may fuppofe, replied I, that in this 
flight love has had a part, or that ihe 
has been reduced to defparation by 
iome violence ? I don't know, faid he, 
as the accounts are fo confufed and dif* 
ferent; all fay, that her. parents had 
deftined her for a cloy^fter, and that flic 
was inconfolable on the fudden depar- 
ture of a gentleman of her acquain- 
tance : let what will be the reafon, I 
am forry for it ; as they write me, that 
ihe is a moft amiable young lady, and 
of a fpirit fuperior to her fex : her good 
qualifications make me compaffionatc 
her troubles; and I am forry that Ihe is 
not come direftf^^ to Lvons, where flic 
fliould not have wantecf protefHon and 
reception. I did not lofe one word of 
what he faid; and already, upon his 
pleafing expreifions, my vanity fldttered 
xne, that I might have reafon to hope 
tie beft. Being very happy at haTiiig!: 
found one that pitted me without know^ 
ing me, Ifeemcd to be no longer ii^ 
danger; becaufe he would have affified* 
me much more. If 1 had made myfelf 
kno;wn to him. With thefe thoughts I 
endeavoured to appear chearfuh CoflFcc' 
being brought, he iniifted upon my tak-» 
ing another diih to keep him company- 
Juft at this inflant came a footman, and 
faid to him. Sir, my lady fent me to 
?a/k you, if you will let her have the 
horfe, that flie fpoke to you about, for 
twenty piftolcs ? He anfwered rough- 
iy» No; tell your miftrcfs, from me, 
that I have changed my mind, and that 
I will not fell that horfe. This is a^ 
horfe, faid he, turning to me, that I 
wanted to get rid of; and I had fold 
him to my fitter for the half of what he 
coft me. It is now fifteen days that ihc 
has been beating down the price, and 
now goes increafing it by a crown at a 
time. Rather than be plagued for fuch 
a trifle, I'JI take back my horfe, and 
fhe may provide herfelf fomewhereeUe. 
Amotng the other advices Celiftina had 
got from my landlady, was that of pro- 
viding a hone, to tranfport our goods 
and cloaths, where we pleafed, with lefs 
expence, I thought on it then. And 
are 
are you refolyed, faid I to my friciKf, 
not fo fell the horfe to your iifter > or 
do you do it out of revenge ? He an- 
fwered me ferioully that he would rather 
give him to any body elfc than fell him 
to her ; there is nothing that difobligcs 
me more, than her ftinginefs in mak- 
ing a bargain. Well, faid I, if you'll 
fell him, ril buy him, as 1 have juft 
now need of one. With all my heart, 
replied he ; but you muft know, that 
he is better for a coach than far a fad- 
die : I had the pair, and they coft me 
four hundred crowns ; but having loft 
one, I have never been able to matc^ 
the one that remains ; for which rca-» 
fon, I want to get rid of him. That 
fignifics nothing, replied I, he will fervc 
me to carry my portmanteau j I want to 
go t(^ Orleans, and that by Ihort jour- 
neys, to do fome bufinefs of mine, and 
to fee, at the fame time, the moft fa- 
mous city of Burgundy ; and for this 
route the horic will ferve me wonder-* . 
fully well J and when I have done with 
him, I can always get for him what he 
coft me. That's very true, replied he, 
you think as you ought ; nor can you 
find a better horfe for your purpofe : 
let us take another difli of coffee, and 
then you'll do me the honour to go 
home 
(59) 
lomc with rac to my houfe, where vent 
^11 fee him, and we will agree or him 
in four words. I imagine that firom 
Orleans you will go to Paris; it is time^ 
at your age, that you had ieen that 
metropolis : there you will make con* 
quefls; andp in a coumry like that^ 
where the liandfomenefs of a man's per- 
fon is efteeiT^J, I do not know how you 
will be able to pleafe fome, without 
difgufting others. Whenever it is fo^ 
anfwered I, Til contrive to do for the 
beft; and fo faying, he made me flep 
into the coach, and condu£ted me, in 
his company, to the door of his palace« 
Stepping out of the coach, I faw im- 
mediately that it was not a houfe be* 
Jonging to a poor man. We went into 
a fpacious court yard, all pav^d with 
marble, furrounded with a. double or- 
der of pillows, and adorned with four 
fountains, that threw over, in four 
great Ihells of brafs,.an artificial (hower 
of rain. From thence he conduced 
nie into a hall, adorned with ftucco- 
work, and painted in the higheft tafte. 
He then ordered the horfe to be 
brought. Here he is, faid he j and Til 
maintain him to be without apy dc fj<5h 
He looked well to the eye; but to jtidge 
of him, and what to make of him, 
there 
rfherc required fomething more tlun ! 
know how to fcale a garden- wall. As 
'lo this, faid I, Til Mke him upon your 
word ; and be fo good as to tell mc the 
-price, and you fhall te fatisfied imilie- 
diatcly. 1 do not look for this now, 
anfwered he, and to talk of that Ve 
have time enough. It is ftlU very hot, 
and a good while iince we drank coffee^ 
I hope you won't refufe mc the honour 
of taflipg a bottle of my winej and wc 
will drink it iced, that it may be the 
cooler. I did ali poifible to excufc my- 
fclf, but his courteous behaviour pre- 
vented my refufal, and i found it ne- 
ceflary to oblige him ; and while the 
wine was coolmg ki ice, wc took a turn 
in the garden, f^ a private gcntle- 
inan, I never faw a more *fine and de- 
licious (jpotrgreen-houfes, ftady walks, 
odorous hedges, a continued carpet in 
the path embelliflied with flowers, all 
things that delighted the fight, and at- 
tra,(ftcd my wonder^ In the midft of 
thefe delights, and among fo many 
courtefies that I had received, 1 found 
myfclf very much embarrtffed. I was 
afraid that I Ihould not be able to fuf- 
tain, as I ought, the pcrfon of a man 
l)efore one of fo. refined a tafte, and that 
lie would not let me depart, kftcr having 
obliged 
V 
(6i) 
obliged me fo much, withotit defirtUg 
to know fomething of me, and mjrcon- 
dition of life. Being under a ncceflity to 
appear as a man of quality, I did not 
know how to get off, with honour, from 
a converfation that I had not forefeen^ 
and that feemed to me fufpicious. 1 
ftudied the properefl: manner to anfwer 
any queitions of that fort; but, as good 
fortune would have it, there was no 
need, as he afked nothing on this head. 
From the garden we returned to the 
hall, where I found a magnificent col- 
lation prepared. I was obliged to eat 
and drink to jJeafe him ; but could not 
find any opportunity to get away, and 
more than once I attempted to take my 
leave, but he flill detained me by hh 
obliging behaviour J protefting, that my 
.pcrfon plcafed him, and that my com- 
pany gave him the highcft f atisfaiflion. 
We talked on a hundred different things, 
but nothing on my affairs ; and this his 
civil indifference pleafed me more thaa 
all the reft. Curious people. are fre- 
quently very troublefome ; difcourfing 
with ftrangers, they think they have an 
indifputable right to know all ; and they 
do not refle<5t, that thofe who travel in 
a ftrange country, have a thoufandrea- 
fons for telling only what they pleafe.

quefiions, I was obliged every mdmenc 
to rack my invemion, and had the good 
fortune to anfwer every ifain^, that was 
put to me, to the fatts&dtioi) of the 
company in general. Monfieur D'Ar* 
core, after having left us fome minutes, 
returned, faying. Sir, it is time to fee 
if my cook has known how to pleafe 
you ; and, with this joke, made us fit 
down to fupper, which was drefled in 
the highefi tafte, and very elegant, I 
jnuft confefs my appetite was diminifli- 
cd greatly, by my apprehenfions that 
Moniieur D'Arcore would begin the 
difcourfe upon the ftory from Avignon ; 
and if the company had obfenrcd in nae 
any thing effeminate, I fliould certain- 
ly have been difcovered in that meeting. 
The Icaft talk upon that topic would 
have put me to the Wuih ; and my baih- 
iuln^U was fufficient to excite, inctherSji 
Ibme fufpicions. Supper being over, 
they began to fing the airs of the opera 
for that year : Celiftina aifo fung to 
pkafc the company ; and accidentally 
©bferving that I underftood mufk, they 
preffed me fo much, that^ not to make 
a ridiculous figure^ I tuned aa Ita&n 
G3 «r. 
( 66 ) 
air^ whicli I had pcrfeflly in my me- 
mory. At the firft cadence they all 
clapped their hands ; , and Mr, D'Ar- 
core cried out, that I had a woman's 
voice, and that he never heard a more 
fweet and delicate one than mine. I 
thought I ihould have fwaoned away at 
thefe words : I endeavoured to conceal 
my blufhes, by a feigned laugh ; and 
Celiftina, to turn the difcourfe, began 
to talk about the fluffs that Ihe had 
bought that day, declaring, that flic 
never had laid out her money to better 
advantage. TlKrc was no occafion for 
any thing more; the difcourfe immedi- 
ately changed, and nothing was talked 
of but filks, their colours, and fafluons. 
Juft tQ this interim the clock ftruck 
twelve, and all were for returning to 
their own houfes; but Mr. D'Arcore 
would ix)t permit, he having affigned 
Qvery one their apartment, and we all 
retired to rcpofe ourfelves. My mind 
yas taken up with the thoughts where 
this extravagant civility would cjod ; it 
feemed to me, that all was a riddle; 
awl feeing that he diftinguiihcd me 
above all the others, I could not per- 
jiiade myfelf that he would ufe all this 
diAini5^ion to a man ; Celiftina alfo 
could not think otherwise. We talked 
about 
( 67 ) 
about It moft part of the night, but 
without rcfolving on any thing. When 
the morning was pretty well advanced, 
I got'^ up ; but Madam Tavenot no 
iboner heard me up, than ftie came 
into my chamber, and a/ked me, what 
I thought of our genteel hoft ? I an- 
fwered her, that 1 thought hhn the on- 
ly one In the world, that made fo much 
of perfons that he had never known be- 
fore. And with all this, faid Ihe, he is 
only the fon of a merchant, fuch as my 
father was ; he has Succeeded in bufi- 
nefs extreamly well, and my father was 
ruined : this gentleman, being heir, af- 
ter his father's death renounced his bu- 
fiiicfs, and thinks of nothing but en- 
joying what was left him, but that with* 
out ruining himfelf : he does not fpend 
profufely, but he will have every thing 
that is neceflary, Inftead of letting 
himfelf be impoveriihed by a troop of 
fervants, fwom enemies to their ma- 
ilers, he is not defirous of making a 
great Ihew of pomp and magnificence ; 
and keeps only a cook, a coachman, 
and two footmen. He tranfa<5ls his own 
bufinefs for amufenient ; and employs 
neither ageiit, fteward, or fecretary ; 
but at hk table he will have, both at 
dinner and fapper, three or four diihes^ 
extra- 
( 68 ) 
extraordinary for his friends. The; no- 
bility do not difregard him, becaiife he. 
is not ambitious of being on a par with 
them. Every one in the city loves him, 
beqaufe he does good to all ; and to ob- 
tam any favour of him, there is no need 
to aft it. He has diftinguilhcd you, 
becaufe he knows you to be a ftranger, 
which, with him, is rcafon fufficient. 
This is his way of thinkings but he has 
a fifler, who is of a very different opi- 
nion : fhe is altogether as fordid and 
miferable, as h^ is generous and good ; 
ihe had a hufband who was prefident 
of the parliament, and, by her fordid- 
nefs, flie broke his heart : I (hall fay no 
more in favour of that gentleman, only, 
that he had lined his morning gown 
withfonncts, printed on filk, that were 
dedicated to his praifc : when the pre- 
fident put on that gown, he was all 
philofophy and poetry from head to 
foot. This difcourfe of Madam Tave- 
not diverted me much, and Mr. D'Ar- 
core came in, and caught us laughing^ 
without knowing that his ftftcr was the 
caufe of our mirth. Tea was brought 
in ; and when we had drank it, he gave 
orders that nobody Ihould be admitted 
to him that morning, becaufe he chofe 
to enjoy my company alone. I do this 
frequently« 
( 69) 
frequently, faidhe, when I meet with 
pcrfons of fpirit, as you arc, with whom 
I can fpend an hour agreeably. I am 
fo plagued with the company of fomc 
people, who have nothing but the figure 
of a man to recommend them, that I 
had much rather be alone- Would yo» 
believe* it. Sir, faid he, in a large city 
like. this, where intcreft is the ruling 
principle, that luxury is fuftained by 
commerce alone ? and in this there is no 
rule, bocaufe all endeavour to be equal ; 
I can give you but little account of our 
nobility, bccaufb I do not. keep com- 
pany with tliem; neverthdefs, as I 
know that my income is not inferior to 
theirs, I do not eftct m niyfcif any ways 
beneath th^in, though Uiey\have old 
parchanents with ^tient jpriviledges, 
vBhich my faxiiily hai pp^i,^ upon this 
fuperiority, that they have oypr nie by 
birth, they think I am obliged to fcrve 
them, if they deign to coinmand me : 
if they aik noe to Tend them phe hun- 
dred piflples, they think they do me a 
fay ay r; and if I nave courage jto cjeny 
i^^ xny refufal becomes a crime : to 
have their good opinion and ^fteem, I 
anuli . keep open purfe at their com*^ 
mand.^ and buy their. land at their own 
price, if they want tg fell it : (landing 
ut 
( 70)

I coufider them as charcoal, that burn^ 
or blackens ; nor do I find a better way 
of dealing with them, than by a refcrv- 
ed and complatfant carriage towards 
them* To pafs away my time, I cotild 
Jkeep company with women of quah'ty,' 
and divert myfelf by intrigues and gal- * 
kntries ; but ii^thiSjthcre arc alfo rocks: 
if they arc married, one is liable to the 
extravagant jealoufy of their hulbands ; 
if they are virgins, thieir chief ftibjeft ^ 
of difcourfe is matrimony; the com- 
merce with certaiB others of that fex, 
brings fcaadal-, and becomes not a per- 
fonofhue^nourj to'take a wife againft. 
my iiicliriation, would be downright.

having made war on all the powers of 
Europe, they alfo make it among them*- 
felves, and in this alone they are una*- 
nimous ; every one will obfiinatcljr 
itvaintain his point. There was in the 
coffee-houfe, the other day, an abbot 
without an abby, who ftyles himfelf 
Marquis, pretending to a be a nobleman 
by birth, that he is intimately acquaint- 
ed witli all the cardinals in Rome, and 
two or three of them are his relations; 
he refufed a bilhopric of four thoufand 
piftoles'per Aiwiura : he has been every 
where ; has read every thing : not a 
lady in Lyons but has courted his con- 
fidence ; and he fpends regularly every 
day, thirty piiftoles in trifles. Would 
you. think, that, with all this feif-con- 
ceit, and 4o much parade, the wig that 
he wears is, at leaft, ten years old? he 
dines every day for ten-pence, and 
fpends three-pence more daily, to ftun 
people fix hours continually with talk in 
a coiFc e-houfc, fprcading th«fe his dreams 
of grandeur. 
1 had a great defire to know a per- 
fon of this odd charafler ; for which 
reafon we went immediat^fly to the 
coffee-houfe, where we were in hopes 
of finding him, it beii)g the hour he 
ufually 
aally came at. He was juft gone a* 
r came in. We found there however^ 
his flead, a man of letters, who dlC- 
edited all x^orks that were not his own : 
was dif{iuilng upon fome points of H<» 
rature with a phyiician, not lefs ex- 
ivagant than himfelf: our coming dif- 
ncerted them, and fent them away 
rangling. Mr. D*Arcore, taking mc 
de, re-alTumcd the difcourfc. He that 
*nt away, feeing me faid he, is aiham« 
I, becaufe I know him : at prcfcnt. 
t ftyles himfelf phyfician ; but, a few 
rars ago, I faw him in Holland, when 
I was a quack-do<5tor. To hear him 
fcourfe on phyfic, he knows more 
an Hypocrates. Among other things, 
e mafter of the cofFce-houfe makes his 
n write down all that this quack fays, 
id afterward get it by art : with this 
ipital of erudition, he thinks of fend* 
ig him to Paris j and . making him a 
by fician, without the affiftance of a 
)llege. It is two years, and more, 
lat that young lad has been writing 
ich fluff, without learning any thing, 
his prime phyfician, his mafter, has

CHAP. IX. 
fbi Death of Cell/Una^ and NiWS of 
Count Vermes. 
NOtwithflanding a variety of ideas 
ran in my head, 1 heard Mr. 
O'Arcore with pleafure ; who would 
lavc continued his difcourfe about the 
)hy<ician, had not one of his domeftics 
>rought us word that we were wanted at 
lome, and that with all imaginable 
peed. This meffagc was like a wound 
n my heart, as I was continually ap- 
)rehenfive of fome misfortune. As we 
Arent along, a thoufand thoughts came 
nto ray mind ; and as ray mght from 
Avignon was my only crime, fo I was 
ilways in fear of being difcovered, and 
3unilhed in fome exemplary manner. 
Hi Whit 
( 76) 
What miftaken ideas do wc form of 
futurity ! and how naturally does guilt 
fix the moft dreadful impreffions on our 
mind ! When we were arrived at Mr; 
D'Arcore's, I met with nothing of what 
ray apprehensions had fuggefted, but 
found my felf plunged into the moft cruel 
diftrefs that could have happened to one 
in. my circumftances : my poor Gelifti- 
na had been fuddenly taken ill with a 
m6ft violent cholic,.and was reduced to 
the greateft extremity. The diforder 
had feized her about half an hour be- 
fore we came in, and I found her 
without motion, out of her fenfes, and 
not able to Utter bne word. 'Tis im- 
poffiblc to conceive with what exccffivc 
grief this difmal cataftrophe affliAed 
me : I threw my felf, trying, upon the 
bed ; I embraced her, and called her 
by her name ; but (he did not anfwer ! 
ihc fccraed not to hear me ; nor could 
one perceive that Ibe was alive, only by 
a languid turn of the eye — a fatal fign 
of the fevere convulfions that were tear 
^ng her bowels, and haflening her to her 
laft moments! I have.npt heart to de- 
fcribc, even now, either her fituation or 
my own, though fo many years have 
paffed : my memory prefents to my 
mind that fatal day, which ilill affe^ 
mc 
( 77 ) 
me with the greateft horror.; In vain 
did we look for fuccour from the phy- 
ficians. Mr. D'Arcore did cTcnr tning 
in his power to prefcrve her lite 5 but, 
at the end of two hours, my poor Ce- 
liftina died ! — 
My grief for her death was fo vio- 
lent, that it was almoft Impoffible for 
me to preferve that fecret which I had 
hitherto fo cautioufly obfcrved : I aban- 
doned my felf to fuch defpair, that they 
dreaded the lofi of my fenles. As it 
was ncceffary to take me by force from 
that room, tney pat me into a coach and 
conduced me td a councr^-houfe of 
Mr. D'Arcore^ to which he himfelf 
accompanied me. Before I !eft Lyons, 
I recomanended the care of poor Ctlif- 
linit*s funeral to Madam Tavtnot; and 
defired her to pack up every thing that 
belonged to me, and to fend rhem into 
the country, from whence I did not in* 
tend foon to return. When I was a lit- 
tle r^overed from the lethargy, into 
which dfeep melancholy ha:d thrown me, 
and returned, as one may fay, into my- 
felf ; I found myfelf in a chamber gen- 
teelly furnifhed 5 from the windows of 
which, nothing was to be feen but a 
del^htful verdure ; Mr. D'Arcorc flood 
by me^ and ufed his utmdft endeavours 
»3 t% 
(78) 
to cootfole mc for the lofs of fo amiable 
a wife (as he indeed imagined ihe was) ; 
liis advice w^s that of a friend; and 
his maxims, thofe of a true philoib- 
pher : I found myfclf equally obliged 
by his genteel manners, and convinced 
by the force of his arguments : but no 
oneknewmy iituation.ib well as my- 
felf. My principal objeA was, that not 
even he mould penetrate into the fecrets 
of my Jieart 5 for which reafon, I 
^gg^d he would leave me alone for a 
jQiort time; adding, for an excufe, 
that I found an inclination for a little 
ileep : upon which he courteoufly de« 
|)arted, and fent a fervant to ibut the 
windows, and the door of the chamber. 
} threw myfelf on an tsfy chair ; not to 
Ileep, which, in my agitation of minds 
was impoffible, but to vent^ with tears, 
my grief I and to feek, in my deplora- 
ble cafe, fueh afliftance as reafon could 
beft fupply me with. 
Short fighted maid ! faid I, in my 
heart, difiblving myfelf in tears, that 
felicity is loon finiihed, that thou pro- 
mifed thyfelf in flying from fblitude : 
it is not a month that thou hail enjoy<- 
ed that fo much wifh'd for liberty, and 
how much trouble hath it already cofl 
thee ! how much agitation^ how much 
. ^ bitterncfs! 
( 79 ) 
itternefs ! thou haft hardly touched 
le threfhoid of thd world, and thou 
aft already loft, upon this threihold^ 
le £uthfal companion of thy flight, 
[line only counfellor, thy fure guide m 
his troubled fea, which for thee has nei* 
her Ihore or bottom; and where every 
Lttle blaft that blows, menaces thee 
7ith certain ihipwreck! without pa^ 
ents, without friends, without advifers f 
n orphan, under a drefs not her own^ 
bandon'd, wandering, unable what ta 
efolve, what to think, or what to do, 
lot to become hated of thyfelf t per- 
haps thou wilt foon die ; but if thou 
laft ftiU k)ng to live, as. thy youth pror 
nifes, what will be thy lot,, as thou haft 
b little of thy own^ and nothing to 
K>pe for from others ? if thou purlueft: 
he plan thou haft undertaken, thy ho* 
lour IS in danger $ if thou fbouldft re- 
raft, and .return to Avigiion, thy li- 
>erty is in danger. Juft heavens. ! aoi 
to make, in this world, the unhappy 
igure of a bafe-born vagabond ? Oh I 
will voluQtariLy fluit m,yfelf up in»fo<» 
itude; there to die forlorn! In this 
jreat and painful choice, reputation in 
ife ought to prevail : what iigniiies life 
vhen one lives to ones ihame? an4 
vhat durable felicity can one have u{>s 
on 
( 8o ) 
bn earth, wlien, to attain it, muft 
plunge one into a crime ? Agitated by 
tbefe thoughts, 1 tofled and turned in 
the chair, lighing, crying, and fobbing, 
but without refolving on any thing. 
The darknefs of the place >^s mita- 
ble to my fadnefs: the death o^CeKf- 
tina feemed to me a chaftifement from 
heaven, -and which » by way of tei^ror, 
called mt to my fclf : it feemed to- me, 
that With her were finiihcd all my hopes 
of happinefs; fiuce I had no one to af- 
fift me in finding that felicity, which 
I did not hope to find without her. 
One idea fucceeding another, I return- 
ed, in n>y thoughts, to my^own retire* 
jnent; but, in imagination only, I 
trembled with horror : I found that I 
could live there, if not more quietly, 
at leaft more honourably; but I had 
not courage tt^ return, becaufe my 
heart could not condemn itfelf: I would, 
>fiad I would nor, aH in a breath ; I 
would willingly have combined toge* 
ther, honour andiibcrty 5 but I did not 
know how : and at laft, after many 
thoughts for and againft, Mr. D'Ar- 
core ilruck into my mind, as though I 
»uft hope from him fome relief in my 
difficult fituationf or, at leaft, fome 
jtdvice. h it not pofiible, laid I to my- 
felf. 
felf, tliat this generous friend, who is 
fo kind without knowing me, when he 
hears the truth of my iituacion, may 
be touched with conipaiiion : he de- 
lights in doing good for all ; can he de- 
fire a more laudable occafion to exercife, 
in my favour, this his generous talent? 
what wiH it profit him to publilh what 
I am ? and what a ri(k am 1 expofcd to, 
if, by preferving in ray breaft my fc^ 
cret, I do not avail myfelf of the op- 
portunity of his. bounty ? yes, let me 
fpeak to him ; let me throw myfeJf at 
his feet, and lay open to him the fccrets 
of my heart : he is rich, he is young j 
he has in) wife ; he depends upon none 
but -himfelf ; he difiinguiihes me, be- 
lieving me to be a man; who knows .  . 
when he finds me a woman, when he 
fees me in daiiger, when he knows that 
I am defiitute, what honefty^ inclina«* 
lion, %nd Jove, may fuggefi to him? 
In the heat of thefe reflexions, which 
flattered and pleafed me, I got up refo^ 
lutely from the chair where I was fitting, 
opening the room door, and went in 
fearch of Mr. D'Arcore, to beg his .af*» 
fiftance. Having aiked one of his £br- 
vants where his mafter was to be met 
with, he told me that h^ was walking, 
in thfe garden I ] went to^hini Yiith ^ 
irm 
( «2 ) 
firm rcfohition to threw myfdf at hh 
feet, and, with tcarf iir ray eyes, to 
difcovcr myfclf to him, and implore 
liis generous compaffion. He did not 
fee me when I accoftcd him, becaufe he 
Hood with his back to the place I came 
from, and wa» reading attentively a pa- 
per, which I did not perceive till I was 
near to him* Sir, I had began to fay- 
to him J but he, as though furprifcd^ 
ftarted, and putting the paper he had 
been reading into my hand. Take, faid 
he, this letter ; you arc juft come op- 
portunely to read it, and amufe your- 
felf : I received it this liioment from. 
hyoo$, by the Italian extraordinary 
poft-, there is fbmething will make you 
laugh, in regard to an affair of which 
we will talk ibme other tin>e. . He faid 
this to divert my thoughts from the 
dea,th of Cttiftina, not becaufe he ap- 
prehended that there could be any 
thing, in that letter, that could excite 
my curiofity : if he had forefeen that 
the reading of it would have increafed 
my melancholy, he would not have 
named it. At the name of Italy, my 
heart jumped in my breaft -, nor did I 
know for why j my hand trembled in 
taking the letter, as if it forefaw matter 
cf frdh concern, that it would occaiion 
. (83) 
me : Kading it to xnyiel^ I fouad it as 
follows : 
« Dear Sir,

New Trouble to tny Spirit % ard Motives 
to depart from Lyons. 
IT is more cafy to be imagined than 
defcribed, how I ranained after read- 
ing this letter : a thoufand ideas rufhed. 
into my mind ; of fear, of trouble, of 
compaffion, and of love ! The memo- 
ry of the Count of Termes, feemed like 
a fire ftifled aniong ruins ; which took 
at once, in my breaft, its farmer a6lr- 
vity and vigour. In fo long a time that 
I had heard no news of him, he now 
and then came into my mind ; but this 
reuiembrance wore off gradually, and 
gave iiie neither confolation or trouble. 
On feeing the writing, and hearmg his 
fentinients, it prcfentcd him in the moft 
lovely form to my eyes and foul 5 as 
amiable as ever! had fecn him : I was 
forry for the diftance'he was from me: 
his love gave me pleafure ; his wound 
made mc pity him : I was vexed I had 
j^ot taken the direft road for Italy, to 
overtake him : I thought that would be 
the bcft ftep I could take, which it woulcl 
be eafy for mc to fucceed in, even by 
myfelf ; and the difcovering Aiyfelf to 
Mr. D'Arcore, would be the fame as 
dif- 
( 85 ) 
i^iihoiiouring niylelf ; and, without his 
affiftance, I could get to Italy, and find 
out the Count ; I was therefore deter- 
mined to ufe the befi means I was able 
to prevent his knowledge of my plan. 
Thefe, and a thouiand other thoughts^ 
paiTed in my mind; but my greateft 
trouble was, how to conceal my confu- 
fion from Mr. D'Arcore. Having read 
the letter, I returned it to him, fiiiiling : 
he alked me, what I thought of it ? X 
yepUed, that, at the ^r& time he had 
mentioned that affair, at the coiFee- 
hpufe, I had foretold that it was fo ; 
and that love was generally the firft oc« 
caiioa of fuch adventures. I fhould 
have been glad to have dropt this dif- 
courfe, left fome involuntary change 
in my countenance might betray my 
lieart; but, as he ft ill continued it, any 
interruption of mine might have been 
fufpefted : I therefore aiked him, what 
he intended to do, to ferve his friend ? 
to which he anfwered, that he would 
write to all his acquaintance ; but that 
he judged it would be to no purpofe, 
becaufe, if Mifs D'Arville was a lady 
bi fpirit, fhe had taken the direft road 
to Italy. 1 was very willing he ihouid 
think fo, for which reafon I chofe not 
to contradift him. We entered into a 
Vol. I, I a ihady 
^ fliady walk 5 and Mr. 0' Arcore, who 
fiudi^d alj metliods to divert itie, .relat- 
ed to me, a fimilar flory of a young 
, EngUih Ijdy, who had eloped from 
London, a few years ago, and who was 
known by him, at Lyuiis, as fhe was 
goin^ to Paris, Xhe Hory was long, 
and the circuaiilances entertaining ; but 
1 took fo little notice of what he told 
me, that, at prefent, I have only a con-i 
4ifed idea of it : I, in the mean time, 
Hf^s thiiiking only of my own afiairs, 
and believed myfelf fuificiently juftificd, 
]^y my fittiatipni to recede from thcrfc 
meafuifes, which, a few minutes before, 
Ijintfiwied to have taken. I had, pre* 
iint<jd; myfelf to Mr. D'Arcore, fiilly 
x^efolved to acquaint hhn with my cafe, 
^bec^ufe I thought it confident with my 
honour; I had hardly read the letter, ' 
liut my honour fuggefted to me quite 
tiie co/itraxy ; aixl though: I ufed my 
i^tmoft endeavours to hide it from him, 
my love had almoft got the better of 
my rcafon, and drawn from me- a con- 
fpffion of the whole. In truth, the. 
more I ftudied to regulate myfelf, ac- 
cording to the didates of re^fon, thd 
more I was perplexed : I was . fenfible 
that 1 loved the Coimt of Tern^s ten* 
^jdy y zxidf plcafcd with the concern  
that 
(8?) 
hat he fhcwed for me, was refolved to 
f> feek for him in Italy ; but, upon re- 
leftion, I ihould have died rather than 
lave difcovcred, to Mr. D'Arcorc, the 
ecret movements of my foul : in a 
^ord, I was weak, becaufe I was a wo- 
lan; but I would not appear fuch, be- 
aufe my honour was at Aake. Thcfc 
truggles in my mind arofe from a laud- 
ble principle of virtue, by which I was 
onvinced, that it became me to con- 
eal my weaknefs. In this I made the 
ondamental maxims of my phitofophy 
3 confift ; reflf Aing, that the antient 
hilofophers were no more than hien> 
aoughtheyiiudicd to become fuperior 
> the viciilitudes of human naturet 
uch vrcre my thoughts, while Mr* 
)'ArGore was attempting to divert me 
'ith his difcourfej and mentioning, 
ccidentally, the Count of Termcs, he 
feed me, if, in my coming from Italy, 
had not paiTed through Avignon? and^ 
' I there had kqown him, or, at leafti 
eard him named? I had told Mr. 
I'Arcore, from the beginning of our 
:quaintance, that 1 was, by birth, an 
alian, as had been agreed, between 
lyfelf and Celiftina, before we arrived 
I Lyons ; and this queftion of his was 
ways uureafonable ; I frankly denied 
I 2 having 
<«8) 
having ever heard of fuch a perfon, b^- 
caufc my fituation obh'ged me fo to do : 
but, to a fincere friend, ereiy lye, tho* 
ever, fo infignificant, muft coft fome 
blulhes: to this queftion of hfe, artd 
mucli more to the anfwer, my face wa^ 
like fcarlet ; nor could 1 find a better 
excufe, to hide it from him, than by 
taking out my handkerchief, as if to 
wipe from my face the fweat, occafioned 
by the heat of the weather. This pre- 
text feemed to fucceed to my wilh ; and 
I was certain, that Mr. D'Arcore had 
not any fufpicion. In pulling out my 
liaiidkerchief, fomething feemed to fall 
jQut of my pocket upon the ground:; 
but I did not r^rd it^ having other 
things at heart. We had advanced a few 
ileps forward, and were turning back, 
when Mr. IVArcore fiooped lo takt 
up fomething from the ground; and, 
rUing, faid to me. Is this piece of gal- 
lantry feUen from your pocket ? I was 
wondering at the meaning t^f his word^, 
when, to my furprize, I ^^, in his 
hand, the fnuff-box with the Oount of 
Termes* pi6lure, given, by him, to me 
at Avignon : I knew that it was cuf- 
tomary for me to ktep it in my pocket, 
to prevent it from falling into any one s 
hands; but thp accidents of that day had 
fo 
(89) 
fo much^engroflcd my attention, that it 
might eafily fell from my pocket with- 
out my perceiving it. I knovr not how 
it was that I did not drop down at his 
feet, with the confufion of being caught 
in a manifeft lye, of my fex being dif* 
corered, and of being e^pofed to thft 
moft pungent reproof. A fimple aA of 
of civility, pardonable in a friend, had 
ftlmoft ruined me, if Mr. D'Arcore 
had been induced to open that box : 
tiny other woman, in hiy cafe, would 
hare given caufe 6f fufpiciori : it is true, 
I was much troubled ; but aU ifiy trou« 
l^e was internal : as to the external, I 
had extraordinary prefenee of mind^ 
and^ with the grcateft difficulty, took 
the box OHt of his hand : looking at it, 
as if I had fcarcely known it^ I knfwer^ 
fwered. Yes, Sir, it h mine; but I 
wilh it was not (at the fame time put- 
ing it in my pocket) for it has cofi me 
many a fign : this induced him to be- 
lieve that the infide contained the piflure 
of fomeiavourite young lady of my ac- 
quaintance*, and prevented him from 
opening it ; by which means . he would 
have found that of Count Tennes. I 
could not avoid aftfwering fcveral ques- 
tions which he put ta me on this head ; 
but I brought myfelf off very welh

with Ay cloaths, to be faftened behind

put the reins into my hftitd, telling me, 
that the road to Paris was ftraight for- 
ward, and to let the horfe go of him-

and to return foon, according to my 
promifc. The laft farcwel cofl us both

IT is impoffible for any one to con- 
ceive the perplexing circumftanees 
which attefnded me on this jburnfey : I 
faw myfelf alone, on a road that I had 
ijei^er been on before, with a whip and 
reins in- my htfnd, and a high-fnettled 
horfe which required judgment to ma- 
nage him properly. - The road was

ftraight and good, but I feared much 
that it would not continue fo all the

riages, the avoiding and giving place to 
which wai fuch a trouble to nie, that 
it m^ide me tremble through fear of 
breaking my neck : the hor^, without 
being whipped, went on with vigour ; 
but I fliould hare been glad he had not 
gone fo fatt, the better to be able to ma- 
nage him at my pleafure. The only 
confolation I had in finding myftlf 
alone, was, to be able 16 think on my 
circumftances ais much as I pleaied. 1

was expofed to» as a woman, being

/as needful that I Ihould think of tra«

Jiowing what might happen to me;

ing on, acconjpanied w ith fuch thoughts, 
found myfclf, towards night, in a

ipon the left hand, the fign of the

jridle of the horfe, and led him into 
:he yard. After I aljghted, I went to 
fee the horfe taken to the ftable and ied, 
in order to make myfelf converfant in 
many things that I then was unacquaint- 
ed with, that I might be lefs puzzl.d 
[low to a<5i hereafter. When the hprfc 
was rubb'd down, and the chaife put 
up, I ordered the waiter to carry my 
portmanteau into my room. Faffing 
through a lodge, I obfc:rved,a perfoii 
whofe 
(94) 
whpfe appeatance plcafcd me much j 
I enquired of the maid^ if there was 
any gentleman in the houfc that would 
fup, and fpefid the evening with me ? 
ihe informed me, that there was no one 
but that merchant whom I had feen in 
paffingj but that he was an honeft man, 
well known at that iim, and that my 
company would be very agreeable to 
him. 1 fent my compliments to him^ 
defiring the favour of his^ company to 
{upper ; which he returned with great 
civility, and informed me, by the fer*- 
vant, that he would wait upon me im*» 
mediately ; he accordii^gly was with 
mc m a few minutes. When fupper 
was brov^ht; in, we fate down, and eat 
with a hearty appetite. This gentleman 
came from Paris, and was called Duli i 
at every two mouthfuls, he drank si 
large glafs of the beft wine that the inil 
afforded 5 he was either naturally very 
tarkative, or the wine had made hint 
fo ; for without my a/king him, he be-^ 
gan to inform me of his own private 
concerns, as if I had known him many 
years: he told me, he had a wife and 
nine children, but that he had feen none 
of them for fcveral years ; and that^^ 
perhaps, he Ihould never fee thenit 
more. This excited my curiofity to afk 
hiiu 
(99) 
lim tiie reafon ; and he readily pre- 
ceded as follows : 
I am, faid he, by birth, an Italian^ 
nd traded in timber, in company with 
friend of mine, a rich merchant of 
ly own country. Going together, 
rom Venice to Leghorn, about our 
wn bufinefs, with a large fum of twenty- 
ve thoufand livres, which we were to 
lifburfe for a correfpondent of ours, it 
lappened, that we remembered we had 
bme affairs to tranfad upon the road, 
or which my partner was obliged to 
eturn back: I, therefore, went to Leg- 
Lorn alone, with the fum of money that 
was to difburfe; and my firft concern 
ras to find my correfpondent, in order 
o give it to him ; but, unfortunately 
or me, he was out of town, and was 
not to return for feveral day«. I don't. 
:now what malignant planet had the 
fcendaiit over my mind at hat time ; 
was in a capacity to niaintain my fa- 
tiily honourably J my profits were con- 
iderable 5 and, in my own country, I 
lad the character of a man of honour, 
^y wife was. alfo very amiable, and I 
enderly loved my children. Notwith- 
landing this, a tnought came into my 
nind, that ftrikes me wjth horror at the 
remembrance j andthi^ hurried me into 
(96) 
one of the moft extravagant rcfohitioni 
in the world. Seeing myfelf mailer of 
the twenty-five t)ioufand livres, a fro* 
lie came into my head, to gp and 
ti^de in the Indies; hoping there to 
make an immenfe fortune. I found, in 
the port, a yeffel ready to fet fail for 
Holland i I embarked in her, and went 
to Oftend ; and from thence, on board 
of a Dutchman,. I fet fail for "JBatavia. 
Imagine what were the thought! of my 
correfpondents and family, at not hear- 
ing any news of me : they concluded^ 
I had been aflaifinated on the journey. 
My creditors rediKred my family to the 
moft extreme diftrefs; and my poor 
wife gave.herfelf up to the mo& deplo- 
rable melancholy. While they were la- 
menting my fup|»ofed death in Italy, I 
was trading in the Indies, racked with 
the fevereft flings of confciencc 5 and 
tlie fatal confequences of this voyage, 
iegan already to denounce vengeance 
^againft me. Si|ice I had deftroyed the 
fortunes of thiife moft dear to me, I 
Ihould, at le^, have made my own; 
but this did not happen, becaufe my 
.own confcience was my greateft enemy. 
Agitated continually by internal re- 
rinorfe for my crime, I had not refolu- 
tion to take proper care of any thing, 
that 
(97) 
tet HepdtA redound to my advsiAtage* 
wlw no fooncr got to the Indies, than 
looked for an opportunity to return 
Europe. I was no fooner re- 
lirnei, than I found mjrfelf alhamed to 
evifir my afBi<aed femily, to appeafef 
heir grief, and fonfole them at leaft 
rith a certainty of my being alire : the 
Aion I had been guilty of gave me 
;reat trouble, and I was afraid of being 
een by my creditors : the money, that 
had taken with me in my flight, was 
preatly diminilhed j nor was there 
rttough left to heal the oW wound, 
nuch lefs to remedy the future wants, 
f he beft that I could dp, in fuch a fi* 
ualion, not to be be reduced to extreme 
iiifery, was to begin to trade in Hol- 
and with the little I had left* Iinmedi- 
Ltely upion my return from Baiavia, I 
hanged my name, and borrowed that 
)y which you have heard me called in 
his houfe. I bought fome merchan* 
iize of an ibrts, and loading them up* 
>n a horfe, carried about with me my 
hop of goods. With this I go from ci* 
y to city, and from town to town, to 
;et a livelyhopd ; nor ihould I be dif- 
ontented with this manner of life, if, 
low and then, the thoughts of my fa* 
ttily did not awaken the torment of my 
nind. I am confidant to the private 
Vol. I. K concerns 
( 98 ) 
concents of a certain great Princds at 
iParis ;, and have thoughts of throwmg 
my fclf at her feet, that Ihe may employ 
hex intereft to reftore me, without dan- 
ger, to my family and country. When 
S^e was at Rome, about eig^hteen years 
ago, Ihe lodged in my houfe, and was 
there brought to bed of a daughter ; of 
which I Ihall fay nothuig more, only, 
that there was need of my fecrefy. She is 
tinder obligations to help me; but when 
I was at Paris I had not courage to pre- 
fci>t myfelf to her : thus I went, more 
defirous than ever, to fee my family 
once more ; and through my baihful- 
nefs, in not applying to that Princefs, 
W9S obliged to withdraw myfelf, and 
leave them in the falfe opinion that I 
zitk no more amongft the living. In 
this manner Duli difcourfed, partly in 
Italian and partly in French, according 
as the wine operated. This ftiort and 
coiifufed account had made me curious 
of a thoufend little things by him done 
and mentioned ; but though he would 
talJc about himfelf and family, for homrs 
together, of his own accord, he did not 
feem inclineable to anfw^rmy queftions; 
and I found that I was to take what he 
ve me, without looking for more* 
hca we were rifen from table, he in- 
fixed 
f 
(99) 
iRcd upon (hewing rae his goo&; from 
vhich I fhould find, that he had made 
:onfiderable advantage by trading, In 
lis portable Ihop. Among other things, 
n opening a little cafe where he had 
bme jewels of value, he fliewcd me the 
3i6\urc of a lady, fet round with bril- 
iants, which attracted my eye; and my 
ruriofity lefl me to afk who was the ori- 
ginal ? This is, fays he, the piflure of 
he princefs, whom I mentioned a while 
igo, who, before I was married, and 
itiy .mother ftiU living; lodged almoft 
two months fecretly in my houfe, and 
there lay in of a daughter, without a 
word of it being known in Rome, and 
Birhich I never mentioned to any body 
except yourfelf; fofayiag, he took the 
picture haftily out of my hand, and 
locked it up again in the box, aiking ^ 
rae, if I would not buy fome of his 
goods ? As my poor Celiftina had pro  
vided, at Lyons, feveral forts of mer- 
chandize to fell, which now were only 
an incumbrance to me, I told him, that 
I was rather induced to fell than to buy 5 
and that if he would give me what they 
coft me, I wouldfell him a good bargain 
of fome fine ftufls which I had bought. 
He gladly accepted the offer, and we 
went into my room; whcre^ uponfec- 
K 2 ing

tented, paid down the money, and rc- 
^xcd to go to bed.

^tdPrefent made me by Mr. UArcore\ 
with a Letter from bim^ which con^ 
fufed me much, 
IN turning over my portmanteau, I 
was much furprifed at finding a 
fmall cafe, which I had not taken no-* 
tice of befoi^ : in prefence of Duli, I 
did not Ihow my furprize, but, when 
be was gone, I opened it with impati^ 
cncci and I found, to my great aflo- 
niihment, a gold fnuff-box, a diamond^ 
ring, a filk purfe with one hundred 
Louifdores, and a letter from Mr. 
D'Arcorc, which was as follows ; 
** Dear Friend, 
I take the liberty. In t^is manner, 
with the fincerity of my heart, to pre- 
fent you with a few trifles which you 
will nnd here annexed when you are fiur 
from me, and which, I am certain, in 
perfon you would have refufed. I ufc 
this referve with you, becaufe I have 
ilrong motives to believe that you havc^^ 
liotbccn fully fincere with m?. Pcrhaj^s 
I have 
C Ml ) 
, hsLVt not merited your confideqtt; 
revcrthclcfs, I iliall ever eftccra you: 
md certainly my diicretion will mefit 
f^our gratitude. 
I am, ice. 
D'Arcorb. 
I do not know whether I wis more 
lifturbed at the generofitv of this wor-* 
hy gentleman^ or furpriled at the clear 
notice that he gave me of knowmg me 
:o be the lover of Count Termes, or, aft 
caft, that he did not believe me to bfc 
»rhat I had told him. 
This letter was like a clap of thuit- 
3er ; it firuck me motionlefs and preci* 
jitated me into an abyfi of conmlion% 
irhofe rich gifts, though they made k 
ronfiderable addition to my little flock, 
^ave nie no pleafure, bccaufe they 
Teemed like fb many reproofs for my in- 
gratitude. My greateft confolation al* 
«rays had been, that of believing that no 
jne was privy to my affairs; and in 
Battering myfelf, that nobody could 
have kiwwn me for a woman, if I did 
ncrt difcover it niyfcff : by Mr. D*Ar- 
corc's letter I was robbed even of that 
comfort; and though he fecmed dif- 
ercct enough not to conviilce me that 
he had difcovcifcd my ttofe flate, yet i 
K J wa$ 
C !<>» ) 
was uneafy tliroiigh fear of being con^ 
viiu:ed by fome other perfon. The let* 
ter from .Mr. D'Arcore might have 
beea interpreted in a very diiFerent 
light ; but thpfe that arc confcious of 
any fault, always fear the worft. The 
Uccufation laid againft nie being fo du<^ 
bious, I thought iiiainediately of fame 
reply tajuftify myfelf ; but it was diffi-p 
cult to ind a remedy that was not worfe 
than the difeafe : I was refolved not to ~ 
confeis the truth, becaufe I had already 
^one too fer to recede ; and, as my re»- 
putation was at fiake, I could not think 
upon a better remedy than tp interpret 
his complaint in a difierent fenfe, and to 
juftify myfelf by pretendbg not to unr 
.derliand him. 
After many reflexions, I conceived 
In my thoughts a letter, in anfwer, tba^ 
feemed quite aprop6 5 and I refolved to 
kave the letter at the inn, ths^t it might 
be fent to Lyons by the firft opportUf 
rity. I hadi fcarce began to writ^ 
when fortunately I recollcfted, that 
Mr. D'Arcore had in.hish^ods a lett^ 
of mine, fent him by Count Terme^ 
^nclofcdfiu that letter he had ihewn me 
in the gardjcn.. Poor me ! exclaimed l^ 
trembling, what fball I do ? I Ihall b^ 
pgjQ^cnjn'd by my own baii^. wriljingu 
.. and 
t i<>3 ) 
and who knows but thhis the net that 
Mr. D'Arcore has fpread on purpofe 
to confront the letters together, and, 
from the uniformity of the charafters, 
to find out the truth of what he has, 
perhaps, at prefent, only a flight fu£* 
picion ? Thus was I in a worfe dilem- 
ma than before, from which I could find 
no way to extricate myfelf. Gratitude, 
civility, and the defire that I had of 
juliifying myfelf, required, by * all 
means, that I ihould anfwer that letter, 
and contradi<^ the accufation. The ne^ 
ccflity I was under not to betray my- 
felf, forbade my writing it with my own 
hand. By the hard alternative of be* 
ing ungrateful to the perfon who had 
been fo kind to me, or of being cruel 
to myfelf, there was no method but to 
anfwer Mr. D?Arco»e, i» a civil and 
prudent manner, by fome other hand. 
The more I thought of this fcheme, the 
better I approved of it : his receiving a 
letter of mifie, witfhout knowing it for 
another hand, and findihg that it was 
not uniform with the charafters of the 
other letter, would, at leaft, confufe 
him in his firft fufpicions. Without 
appearing to underftand his complaint, 
I juftified myfelf fufficiently^ whereas 
tb£ patling myjfelf :upoa tHe negativ;^,

«fr not giving htm any anfwer at alU 
would certainly make him fiili more 
fufpicious. AU the difficulty coxififtcd 
in finding a perfon to write the letter 
in my ftead, and not give caufe of fufr 
picion to the writer of it. As 1 was 
afraid of every fliadow, fo I was cauti- 
ous that all my anions Ihould be natural, 
fimple, and plain, that they might bear 
the niceft fcrutiny. After many con* 
trivances, one occurred to me that 
fcemed more natural than the reft: with 
the point of a pen-knife I flightlycut my 
right thumb, and then called for forne*- 
body to come up* Duli was not yet in 
bed, but was making up his accounts 
relative to his bufinefs : he was the firft 
that came ^nto my room; and feeing 
sny hand bloody, aiked, what was the 
matter ? I anfwered him, that I had 
cut myfelf flightly in mending a oen; 
but that the cutting my thumb did not 
trouble me much as the not being abfe 
to anfwer a letter, of great inrtportancc 
to me, which I intended to difpatch the 
next morning to Ljrons : fo faying, I 
j>ut a filk handkerchief about my hand, 
to keep up the credit of my wound; 
and he, without defiring to fee it, an- 
fwered me, that, as there was no harm 
Aofxt, he would be iny &cretary» and 
write 
( 105 ) 
write the letter. This was juft what I 
wanted; I accepted the offer with a 
houfand thanks, and dictated the let- 
:er in the manner I propofed, defiring 
lini to take me a copy of it to keep for 
ny fatisfa<5tion, as I ufed to do on eve* 
y 'occaiion : this being doi>e, we retir- 
ed to fleep. At break of tlay Duli was 
ready for his journey, and waked me 
^o take his leave $ 1 alfo got up foon af- 
:er, and called the landlord to fettle nty 
^xpences : in that moment the courier 
pafled by that was going to Lyons, and 
[ gave him the letter direded to Mr. 
D'Arcore, defiring him to deliver it 
immediately on his arrival. While he 
vas refrelhing his horfes, he informed 
ne which was the moft eafy and leaft 
'Xpenfive method for me to take in my 
lourney to Italy, to which place my 
heart was turned ; but I learnt by him, 
that on the road to Paris I fhould not 
find any opportunity to go fuch a jour- 
Qey ; and that at Paris I need not fear 
fucceeding, as there are always people 
going to Italy, either by fea or land, 
with whom I could cafily get there. I 
was then under the neceffity of going 
to Paris : that metropolis excited my 
curiofity ; and being provided with a 
horfe and chaife of my own^ I did not 
think 
( "6 ) 
think I was fo unprovided of ca(h, bwf 
that I fliould be able to fpend part for 
my diverfion. The liberty which I af- 
fumed, under the charafter of a man, 
delighted me fo much, that I was really 
unhappy at not being fuch, that I 
might be able to enjoy it without dan- 
ger. Thus did I fix a refolution to 
proceed to Paris, and there take, if ne- 
ceffary, new meafures. My chaife was 
fooft made ready, and the guiding it 
did not fcem fo ftrange to me as at 
firft ; fo* without thinking of any 
thing elfc, I proceeded on my way. 
About twelve o'clock, on the third day, 
I arrived at Dijon ; and having rcfolv- 
cd not to proceed any further that day, 
I ordered dinner to be got ready, while 
I went to view that fine city. Being in 
the market-place^ every body looked 
after me, and I fudged that, by this, 
they took me to be a woman : to be 
certain whether it was fo or not, I 
Hopped at a gun-fmith's ihop, to look at 
fonie fire-arms of a curious neat make; 
the fliopkeeper, feeing me flop, afked 
me, if I would buy a pair of piftols 
mounted with filyer, of very fine work- 
manlhip ? As I trarelled alone, I 
thought them a neceflary accoutrement ; 
but what, above all, induced me to 
buy 
(107) 
ly them, wasthc thought of impofing; on 
lofc that had oWerved me, and mrikingf 
embelievemetobeaman.'ftheyfhould 
ire the leaft doubt. I contra6\ed for the 
ice, which was five Louisd ores, and 
*fircd that they might be trid in my 
cfence; not fo much becaufe I doubt- 
I, or that I could be able to decide 
eir goodncft, as to learn how they 
ere loaded, and how to avail myfelf 
' them, in cafe of need. I did not 
ant either fpirit or courage ; but I 
anted experience of the world, and 
is I was endeavouring to procure, 
he gun-fmith loaded the piftols and 
ed tbera off; I did the fame, and fire- - 
I them off a fecond time without fear, 
ting not a little proud of my heroifm : 
then ordered the gun-fmith to iload 
em with ball , which being done, I 
at them into my pocket, and went 
V3y very well pleafed with tlie feigned 
;rfonage 1 had reprefented with fo 
uch valour: in fafl:, I was deceived 
I my conjeftures; for I was foon in- 
rmed, that the people obferved me 
ith fb much attention, becaufe they 
ok me for one of the comedians that 
denied the theatre there the preceding 
:ght, and who had gained fome ap- 
aufe by their comedy. On my re- 
irn to the inn, I flopped at a book- 
feller's 
C 16« ) 
feller's fliop> and bought the Gazette i 
and when I got home to my room, fat^ 
down to read it. Under the date ot 
Avignon, they flill continued to men- 
tion my flight ; the Jew, who fold tlfc 
cloaths to Celiftina, had been put 91 
prifonj but they had afterwards rdcaiV 
ed him, not havii^ been able to gain 
any imclligence. Now am I in frcih 
trouble, for fear of being followed and 
taken : I had not finiihed reading- it, 
when in comes a pofiilion with a poll* 
chaife, and behind it four perfons on 
horfeback, . that ferved as a guard. 
My heart beat with fear that they 
were people who came after me ; but 
that was. over in a moment, feeing a 
comely gentleman get out of the chaife, 
to w}\om ail the oth^s, made a low bow, 
as lif tp a perfon of diftipilion. When 
he arrived, he afkcd, if there was any 
company in the Inn ? apd was anfwer-

{iio) 
of my baggage not to fee her mow, 
but embarked for Marftitles on my re- 
turn to France, I never made a inoi^ 
agreeable journey* than this, added i, 
there being, in the veffel, two verjr 
handfome laffes, who merited all my 
attention to g^in their hearts, I could 
not fuccced to get them alone_, as the 
captain of the veffel, to whom they 
were recommended, never leC them be 
out of his light. However, J continu- 
ed to ferve them with an incredible at- 
tention; contenting myfelf, that my 
eyes Ihould fpeak to them in my fa- 
vour. Notwithftanding all th is ,, I thought 
myfelf certain of a conqueft ;) and ima- 
-gined I touched heaven with my fingei-', 
when I arrived at kiffing their hands. 
I'he day that we dropped anchor be- 
fore Marfeilics, I albed one of them, in 
fecret, where they were going tal(xlge? 
-who aiifwered, that Ibe did not know-, 
but that they were both fingers. Very 
good ! faid the Duke, you was fallen 
into good hands; but let us drink a glais 
of Burgundy to their health, and let mc 
hear if you behaved with them like a 
man of fpirit. Before they left thelhip, 
continued I, my adventurers gave mc a 
paj^r, in which they inform'd me where 
their lodging was to be. The next 
day. 
(I") 
<!ay, towards eveoing, I went to pay 
them a vlfit, and ordered a handfomc 
fupper to be brought there. I flaid 
with them till the night was far advanc- 
ed ; and when I was about to go away, 
they begged of me to return the next 
liiornhig betimes, becaufe they had a 
favour to beg of me. I immediately 
forefaw what it would be, but made my- 
fclf ignorant, dcfiring them to fpeak 
freely what they wanttd, and that they 
fhould be fcrved to the utmoft of my 
power: in a word, the captcdn* of the 
velTel wanted to be paid their paflage,* 
and they had not a farthing to pay him. 
Why did not you tell meof this on board 
tlie Ihip? faid I, and V would have 
made him note the payment to the ac- 
count of the fubje(5lion in which he 
lield you, and the liberty he took to 
' deprive me of your favours : enough 
faid ; we'll fee each other to-morrow. 
With this I went away, nor did they 
fee me more. 
The Duke extolled to the /kles my 
incthod of proceeding, in not fufFer- 
ing myfclf to be impofed upon by peo- 
ple of that fort j and he alfo drew their 
characters in his manner, little different 
from the account given me by the hair- 
drefler of the c&medi^is at Dijdii. 
VoL.I, M Hence 
( 122 ) 
Hence it was, that I then conceived 
fuch an averfion to players, as if my 
heart foretold that fome misfortunes 
would happen to me through their 
means. On his getting up from table 
to go to bed, the Duke protefted he had 
conceived an efteem for my perfon. 
If J can ferve you in any thing, faid 
he, command me; in me you will find 
fome thing more, than words: as you 
will pafs by Fontainbleau, you will do 
me a plcafure by coming to fee me : 
it is now time to go to bed. So wilh- 
ing me a good night, he retired* 
CHAP. XV. 
My Arrival at FofUsinbUau, and afttr* 
wards at Paris^ 
I Had been told, by many, that the 
Duke of * *   was of an obliging 
difpofition, and very well received at 
court ; but I never had the vanity to 
think, that fortune would place me on 
fo good a footing with him* Since my 
flight from Avignon, I did not go to bed 
fo contented and eafy as that night, after 
I had fupped with him. Promifing my- 
felf greatj advantage, at Paris, by his 
prot^ion; I almoft rejoiced in my 
boldac&, that had encouraged me to 
make 
( 1^3 ) 
make a fiep fupcrior to my fex and 
condition. Poor women ! faid I, to 
myfclf, you are condemned to be un- 
happy ; if conftraincd to live between 
the domeftic walls, you .cannot exert 
yourfelves in fearch of a fortune which 
is not to be found eaiily, but by thofe 
that feck for it. By the force of fu<rh 
reflexions, I began to think fo difad- 
vantageoufly of my own iex,that it made 
me pity them. As I kept company 
with the men, my aAions and thoughts 
acquired, every day, more virility; 
and I became lefs timorous, more en- 
g^ghig, and more free. The Duke, 
my proteftor, as I ihall hereafter call 
liim, departed the next morning on his 
journey. I was up betimes, to take my 
leave of him before he departed ; and 
he feemed to approve highly of my di- 
ligence : he renewed his aflurances f 
favour, which he had made me the 
night before with fo much affeftion. I 
accompanied and ierved him till the mo* 
ment that he entered his coach, and pre- 
pared to fct out foon after him. He rode 
poft, and arrived iit Fontainbleau that 
evening. I, who was not in hafte, did 
not arrive there till the next day. My 
firft care was to drefs myfelf in the beft 
manner I could^ in a fuit that was made 
Ml for 
.( 124) 
for mc at Lyons, and to go dirc<5^1y to 
the Duke's palace, to pay him a vifit : 
tut here I was difappointed ; for a^ 
foon as he had paid lils coniplinicnts to 
the King, he fet out poft for Paris. I 
ilaid fome tidiie at Fontainbleau, to ad- 
. iriire the beauties of that royal abode; 
and, after three days, returned to the 
' Duke's palace to gain fome intelligence 
. of hiin. His fervants told me, that he 
was not yet returned, nor did they 
know when he would; and I, not 
knowing what to do there without him, 
got again into my chaife, and took tHe 
road to Paris. I fpent two days in tra- 
velling eighteen leagues, though I could 
have done it in one; but the objcds I 
met on the way were wotthy of obfer- 
vation, and employed a coiifiderablc 
part of jny time. 1 never faw a more 
delightful road; on each fide, fuperb 
. palaces and pleafant gardens, and inter- 
mixt with flowers and cver-greens,' pre- 
fented themfelves to my view : an im- 
meafe number of people on the road, 
going and coming, on horfeback, on 
foot, and in coaches, with the nioft 
magnificent equipages, gave additional 
grandeur to the profpe<S : in one place, 
1 jnet the train of a prince ; in another, 
the coach of a princefs : fometimes a 
company 
( "i ) 
company of the King's horfc-guard, and 
rometimes a batallion of French guards -, 
all new objefts to me ; but fuch as gave 
me incredible delight. From Fontain- 
bleaup I travelled on till I came within 
light of Paris ; beholding, as fiir as my 
eyes could difcern, nothing but towns, 
cupulos, fpires, and other high edifices. 
I thought I faw, in that city alone, 
all the world. When I had palTed the 
fuburbs, and had got a little way into 
the fireets of Paris, I found it a verv 
difficult matter to get to the inn whicn 
had been 'recommended to me, called 
the Flandcr's Lodge, at St. Michael's 
bridge. I was, more than once, in 
danger of being overturned, and of 
leaving my chaife broken in the ftreets j 
while I was avoiding one coach before 
me, another was threatening me be* 
hind i and to clear myfelf of thofe on 
the right hand, I ran againft thofe oa 
my left ; till it pleafed heaven, I ar- 
rived fefe and found at the Flanders* 
Lodge, where I found feveral officers 
recruiting, but had no connexion with 
any. In the mean time I informed 
myfelf where the Duke, my prote<ftor, 
lived; and I was told, that his palace 
was not far off. After I had drefled 
jiiyfijf in my habit of ceremony, I 
M 3 waited 
( U6 ) 
waited upon him, and, luckily for mcr 
he was ft ill in Paris, When he ikw 
nie, he embraced^-me. kindly, and I 
found him more courtebus than ever ; 
whether it was becaufe his partiality to 
me was increafing, or whether the 
drefs, in which I prefented myfelf, me- 
rited this greater regard, I caimot tell : 
I was dreSed in a proper manner to 
appear at court ; my coat was a rich 
filk of a dark ground, embroidered 
with fmall filver flowers ; my waiftcoat 
was a iky blue, embroidered in the fame 
taiie; I nad a ihirt, with lace ruffles, 
very fine ; and my hair was drefled, and 
tiealoofe, hanging in ringlets on my 
flioulders, and (o long that it reached to 
the bottom of my back; I wore a very 
fine hat, with a white feather, which 
gave more than ordinary majefty to my 
Mature; the fword, which 1 wore by 
my fide, was filver hiked, and gilt; and 
a fword knot with deep red and gold 
flowers : upon the whole, I foupd that 
the Duke, naving noticed me from head 
to foot, obferved me with pleafure, and 
thought me worthy of his diflin^tion. 
What did you think of me, faid he, 
when you aid not find me at Fontain- 
bleau ? if you had put off coming till 
lo-morrow, I ihould have been ^upo.a 
the 
( 127 ) 
the return there, while you was feekuig 
me at Paris ; who Icnows but that you 
imagined it was all done on purpofe not 
to let you find me ? I affured him, that 
I Ihouid willingly have gone ten times 
as far, to have had the honour of fee- 
ing him. You look, faid he, like a 
bride going to her hufband ; and I will 
certainly take you with me to Fontain* 
bleau, to revenge myfclf on fomeof the 
ladies at court, thaX are infenfible of my 
addreiles. I told him, laughing, that 
I would do myfclf the honour of going 
with him wherever he pleafed. 
. We fet out from Paris in his coach, 
.together with his fecretary, and took, 
on a fuU trot, the road to Fontainbleau. 
To pafs away my tirtie in trjjrelling, he 
afked me, iif, on my coming from Marr 
feilles, I had paffed through Cavillon ? 
to which I anfwered,*thHt I had, as it 
was only twelve leagues dittant* They 
are eternally long, replied he ': At Ca- 
villon I diverted myfelf, very agreeably., 
with Madam Silifti; I never faw n 
woman of better behaviour, or more 
compleat in the art of pieafing; I re?illy 
believe flie Jiais made more conquefls 
than Qeopatra did; did you know her? 
No, Sir, anfwercd I, as I only paiTed 
through that place 5 but I have hear^ 
( 128 ) 
the Marquis of Maflan fpeak of her, 
who lodged at the Little Louvre ; Jie is 
an amiable gentleman, but his compa* 
iiy is a little dangerous to the fair 
fex* That is very true, replied the 
Duke; I know that he paid his addrefies 
to three young ladies all at the iame 
time, and fpent an immenfe treafure on 
them : people of this chara^er confume 
their fortume foolilhly, and make them* 
felves ridiculous. We then began to 
difcourfe of Avignon, but this was a 
fubjeft that did not pleafe me in the 
leaft. I have feen there, faid he, a 
young lady, fo very beautiful, that I 
would give a thoufand crowns Ihe was 
my fecretary*s wife. His fecretary, who 
did not expeft fuch a joke, frankly an- 
fw ered, I (hould be noways defirous. Sir, 
to be in fuch a fituation, Whv ? add- 
ed the Duke ; you would, perhaps, be 
afraid that I ihould do you fome 
wrong ? No, Sir, replied he, you are 
too wife and honefi; but, according to 
the manner in which you exprefi your- 
felf, there would not be wanting thofe 
that would think to the contrary. And 
for this, added the Duke^ do not voU 
know how Mr, . ' > a friend: of 
mine, took a wife ? three weeks after 
marriage^ ihe was. bioiight to bed of 
-  two 
( 129 ) 
tJiro children : when they were Ihewn 
tp him. Ah ! faid he, laughing, wel- 
come ladies j In truth, I did not cxpeft 
you fo foon. But that is not all; he 
" ordered twenty- four cradles to be pro- 
vided, and loaded them in a cart, or- 
dering them to be c rricd to his houfe : 
his acquaintance aikcd him, what need 
there was for all thefe cradles? he an- 
fwered, If, in one month, I have twt> 
children ; at the cndof the year, I ftiall 
have twenty-four : and, out of all thefe 
. cradles, there will not be one too ma- 
ny. In this manner the Duke enter- 
tained us, and we arrived at Fontain- 
bleau two hours before night/. As we 
came near that place, we met feveral 
people, on horfeback, magnificently 
drefled, being no lefs than the retinue 
of the King himfelf, who was juft go- 
ing out a hunting. Here the Duke was 
.obliged to leave his coach, mount a 
horfc, and join the company j nor did 
it avail his protefting that he had not 
.dined, and that he was dying with hun- 
ger and fatigue ; for they infifted upon

The Ducbefs of * takn me for her 
GentUman. 
THE Duke did not return till 
evening, and, as he was both 
hungry and fatigued, went to bed im- 
mediately after fupper. As foon as he 
was up, the next morning, I went to 
pay my refpeAs to him. Very well, 
laid he, at feeing me, you and my fe- 
cretary are two men of fpirit, to let 
fuch violence be ufed with your mafto* i 
at lead you ihould have put your hands 
to your fwords, to defend. me from 
that oppreffi(X) ; they have paid me off 
in fuch a manner, that I ihail feel it for 
this fortnight. Notwithftanding this, 
to revenge myfelf on you. for your 
cowardice, I have appointea you gen- 
tleman to the Duchefs of ♦   * ; pre- 
pare therefore to prefent yourfelf to her. 
On my part, I was very well fatisfied 
with this reproof, thanked heaven for 
having made me acquainted with him, 
and I ah-eady flattered myfelf that I 
Ihould 
(»30 
ihottld make no trifling figure at court* 
His fecretary immediately condu£ied 
me to the Duchefs. And are you, iaid 
ihe, to me, that Italian gentleman of 
Yrhoni the Duke ipoke to me ? I am^ 
anfwered I, bowing, and am come, by 
his orders, to aflure your Griace of my 
humble fervitude. h it poflible I add* 
cd Ihe, your protestor is a gr^at vifio* 
nary, or yourfelf. Sir, are a pnxiigyi 
at thisTage, fo many campaigns at fea, 
fo many battles fuftained with valour, fo 
many cruizers fcnt to^the bottom, fo 
many "wounds by you received, of 
which there does not appear the leaft 
fign 1 This language furprifed me not 
a little; not knowing where it would 
e:nd. I aflured the Duchefs, that I had 
not feen any other fea, but that from 
Venice to Marfeilles ; nor any other 
£re, but that in a chimney in winter 
time. Why, added fhe, the Duke has 
given fuch a defcription of your life, as 
if yoii had been the terror of the fea; 
ana has painted you, to me, in fuch a 
manner, as to make me believe that you 
was all over fire and fmoak; with two 
whiikers of a new invention, that, from 
car to ear, libvered your face all oven 
I could fcarce refrain from laughing at 
the romaotic defcription the Duke had 
givea 
C 13^' ) 
given of ttiy ^perfon-; 'when flic rcpriecl/ 
that it did not fecm extraordinary to her, 
that fuch extravagant whims fhould 
coiive into the head of the Duke 5 but 
th!ait it gave her pleafure to find me fo 
diiferent from what ihe had been made 
to believe. After I had given an 'ac- 
count of myfelf, in the fame manner as 
I had done to the Duke, my piotecJtor, 
Ihe called a footman to condu<?l me to 
the apartment that Ihe had appointed 
for me; ordering me, at the fame time, 
to come to her the next morning, when 
{he would give me further inftrudtions. 
My apartment confifted of two rooms, 
01^ within the other, very genteelly 
furnilhedi and having given the necel- 
fary orders for my little baggage, that was 
left at the Flanders Jnn, to be brought 
from Paris, tTi6 Duke's gentleman came 
to congratulate me, in his name, at my 
arrival, and of the acquifition, as he 
faid, that his houfe had made. This 
gentleman's immc was Mr. Befone ; and 
from his pleafing difpofition I fhould di^ 
reaiy hive contraftcd a particular inti- 
macy with him, had I been inclined fo 
to do. But 1 had my reafons for not 
having: too clofe a conneaion with any 
t^pdy : however, I took care to avoid 
giving offence by rcfcrved behafSouh 
He 
(M3) 
He congratulated me not a little ; aflur* 
ring me, that my air and manner had 
very much pleafed the family, and that 
I ihould be a very welcome gueft : hi 
faft, when he conduced me into the 
common hall, to dinner, I received, 
from every one, a thoufand compli- 
ments; which I returned, as politely as 
I could, by anfwering each, in parti* 
cular, in the manner moft fuitable to 
their dignity. There were prefent, the 
intendant general of the family, the 
two fecretaries, we two gentlemen, two 
pages, the ileward, and the Duchefs's 
waiting-maid. At table there were ge- 
nerally ten of the family, and always 
three covers extraordinary for thofe that 
ihould accidemally come to vifit u«, 
Mr. Befone kept me company all the 
afternoon : and we went together to 
wait upon the Duke, my proteAor, to 
return him thanks. At night they 
fuppcd vefy late j and although I was 
not accuftomed to this manner of liv- 
ing, it no ways difagreed with me; but 
I fupped heartily, and flept better than 
ufual all that night. When I arofe in 
the rooming, a footman came to drefs 
my hair, which he did in the genteeleft 
taftej and at mid-day I went to pa\f my 
refpeffe to the Ihichefs, who- alked-hie,

keeping their wives like flaves : the fame

a lieutenant-colonel of the regiment of 
Perigard, and was killed at the fiege of 
Landaw. As my mother had fuckled 
the Duchefs, fo flie took care of me, 
.who was not above (even years of age. 
When I was with her in Spain, Signior 
Cafardo^ a Spanifh captain, took me 
for his wife. The Duchefs thought, by 
this, Ihe had made my fortune ; but I 
was no fooner his wife, than he was 
obliged to depart for the country, and 
I along with him. His whimfical hu- 
anour was foon degenerated into a 
beaftly wildnefs ; he took more care of 
his horfes, than of his wife ; and I was 
confined to the narrow boundaries of 
my chamber, nor did I enjoy any com- 
pany but that of my own rcfie<Slion.

This is the fignal, by which you can-

ter me, as it appears uriUkely to itie, 
that a. lady of your age, mdrit,* and ex* 
perience, would condefceixl to fall in 
love with a boy. Madam Cafardo here 
became ferkms, affuring mc of the fin- 
cerity of her aiFe6lion, and reproved 
me tenderly, as Jf Ihe knew me to be 
defignedly infei^bie. She had, indeed, 
judged rightly; but was far from guef- 
fing the real motive. I told her, that, 
in 
( i67 ) 
In truth, I liad not yet l?een in love 
with any OiiCi. fitat I/mJght, perhaps, 
Hereafter, havfi^in ajflfefti^. for 'her^ 
and thatlbe^was very >yorthy. ofit \ but

my heart and lips ihould go together, 
if ever I, did n^arry. 11^^, ad(ip(^ ihe,

I . though without any mtention to keep 
my word : my fencing-mafter knock- 
ing at. the. door, Madam Cafardo re- 
tired, though! much diflatis^ed, and I 
j took my hour^s exercife as ufual. 
I Towards night Mr. Befone came to 
me, and I told him, that the Duchefs 
: . had got intelligence of the letter fent to 
I Count Termes; that I had rcafon for 
f not faying it was mine, ^nd begged of 
him to fay the fame, in cafe he fhould 
be afked* He exclaimed greatly againft 
MadamCafardo, as a woman wlio want- 
ed to know every thing, and.CQuld 
I keep nothing fecret ; alTuring me alio, 
[  that he would affirm it to be his .letter, 
and that there was nothing of impor- 
tance in it. Early the next moraing 
the Duchefs fent one of the fervants for 
n>e; this impatience made me fufped 
that Ihe defired to know what account 
I could give her of the" letter, and I, 
being 
( 168) 
bemg prepared with an anfwer, waited 
upon her to know her rommands« 
This, faid ftie, is a letter which you 
muft deliver into the R^nce^ own 
hands, before mid-da^ ; and I wiH tell 
you in what manner j'ou muft convey 
it to him. This nieflkge cOttW not have 
happened at a worfe time, not that I 
was unwilh'ng to ftrve the Du^heft in 
a matter of luch confequenCe, but I 
was appreheafive of being oWiged to 
deliver the watch to the ISrince, which I 
thought he would certainly alk for. 
The Duchefs having inftruAed nic 
what method Ilhoiild take to deliver the 
billet to the Prince, I took my icave. 
I was ordered to wait in a remote part 
of the park, where the Prince was to 
come, and not to move from thence : 
twelve o'clock was the time limited ; 
and, although the thoughts of the watch 
troubled mc much, I refolvcd to return 
it to the Prince^

Abt finding me in my cnamber, (he

That is true, replied he; yet, I affure you»

pleafed me in my youth, are now tire-

was not becavife the fire was extinguilh-

that it might prove more fatal to me'; 
as,^ in fa<S, it happened. What had 
been faid in the garden, the preceding

excited my curiofity to know ftill more. 
Madam Cafardo's lover was fome per-

they both went into the palace together : 
fome one elfe, of whom they ware dif^ 
courfing (having given him the n^mc 
of Buffoon) was an accomplice in the 
intrigue : and I was defirous to know 
who they both were. It was not like- 
ly that Madam Cafardo, after what flic 
bad heard from me, would hazard any 
more her intrigues in the garden, but 
I was deceived in my conjc<Stures ; for 
having pofted myfelf on the watch, the 
following night, I was aflfured of the 
truth of what had pafled the night be-

the fecret lover of Madam Cafardo fay,

which iiQw a-days iiQia!>e3 a figure in the

that of a comedian, in which his abi- 
lity is p^rtic;ulgLrly good , bAXt, on the 
contrary, his villainous talents are- 
luuch fuperior, and I do not believe 
that, among, the limg, there is a raf* 
cal of fo bl^cfc a- heart, or^ a greater 
reprobate , at leaft, all who have had 
dealings with him give him tliat cha- 
rafter. The Duke prote^Ss  him, bc- 
caufe he pretends that , he fcrvcd hini 
once as a p'mip, a murderer, and a 
fpy J and, as the Marquis of * ♦  *, 
his nephew, ha^ the infpe<5ti(ia of the 
court theatres, this, fdlow applies to the 
Duke whenever he has occafion to beg 
a favour for himfelf, or a penfion for. 
the oth^r comedians. At prefent he is 
the head of a cojnpaay from Troyes ; 
biit being hated :by them for the. pre- 
fumption he ufes them with, and fome 
difcontent happeniiig, he wants to get 
clear of thqni, agd t9.g;srt..a plaqe, fo^- 
; / himfeif 
(i8o) 
himfelf and family > in the King's com- 
pany - in which he will without doubt 
fuccee4^.as the Buffoons have bed fuc-, 
cefs now a-days : though there are peo- 
ple of credit who countenance him, I 
nave never had any thing to do with 
him J nor do I know what the Duke 
finds in him, to maintain him ; his ex-. 
tradion muft be very bad, being of a 
race of baftards for four generations 
back, all the vileft dregs of the king- 
dom. 
No pifture could be more lively than 
this; and Mr. Befone could not fay 
enough, when he decliimed againft the 
abufes and corruption of the world., 
Thefe particularities made me remem- 
ber him for one of thofe I had icen on 
the theatre at Troyes, and pointed 
but to me, by the courteous hair-drefler, 
by the name or Monfieur 1 artar. And 
fo he is called here, replied Mr. Be- 
fone, becaufe his father had him in 
Tartary, and paffed over Mufcovy to 
France. What affair, added I, can he 
have with Mrs. Cafardo ? I faw him 
come out of her room a little while ago. 
I do not know, faid he, as I take no no- 
tice of.pthcr people's bufinefs; but he 
has certainly been there to do good for. 
himfelfi or mifchief to foiuebody elfe, 
' ^ The 
( i8i ) 
The thought direcftly occurred to mc, 
tliat he muft be the Buffoon mentioned 
in the garden, and, by the apprehenfion 
that fuch a black-hearted villain was 
plotting againft me, I was feized with 
tlae grcatcft horror. Then the advice 
of the young man at Troyes, which' 
was, to keep myfelf as far from fuch' 
people as from the feven mortal fins,- 
feemed to ba prophetic; and I conceived 
fuch an averfion for them, that, when 
I heard the leaft mention of comedians, 
fingers, and theatres, my blood ran 
chill in my veins. I was in the midft of 
thefe thoughts, when a fervant broughr 
me word, that the Duke wanted to fee 
me. This jealous hulband, thought I^ 
wants to know fome news of his wife j* 
but I was miftaken, there was worfe for 
myfelf. As foon as he faw me^ he aik- 
ed me, in a treacherous tone, if I had 
no news to tell him ? to which I anfwer- 
ed, that I had none, in which his Grace 
had any concern. Then I know more 
than you, faid he ; ferioufly afking me, 
if 1 had {cen Madam Cafardo ? I an- 
fwered him, that I had ; and he repln 
eJ, I know you love her, and it pleafe$ 
me to think that you have a returni 
This friendlhip is not without fom« 
piyfiery ; I can fwear, Sir, replied I, 
Vol. I. R that' 
( l82 ) 
that in my correlpondence with Ma- 
dam Cafardo, my love had no partj 
And I can fwear, replied the Duke, that 
I do not believe you, and I wonder at 
your being fo infincere with me : I 
know that, at your age, a flip is par- 
donable; but, dear Richard, when gen- 
tlemen make a falfe ftep, they ought  
not to forget the debt of a perfon of ho- 
nour : you underftand me now ! or 
would you have me explain it more 
9I early ? I do not know. Sir, faid I, 
that I have committed any error that 
merits this reproof. This is too much, 
replied the Duke, and really fo much 
diifimulacion offends me: how ! do you 
;hink that I do not know what has paf!- 
ed between you and Madam Caferdo, 
who now finds herfelf fo unhappy, in 
having fuppofed you a man of honour ! 
on her account I will pardcn your 
youthful indifcretion, upon condition, 
however, that you religioufly maintain 
your promifes to her : I have heard, 
from her, the amorous arts you have 
pra6Ufed with her, to feduce her ; but 
I would not lofe that good opinion that 
I had .conceived for you, by findifig you 
(leficient in fo nice a point : your mar- 
rying her will honour you more than 
.ever; and I woader that it ftiould re- 
quire 
( i83 ) 
^uire fo much to make you accept 
what you ought. I need not fay I was 
flruck to a ftatue, and ahuoft deprived 
of my fenfes; I did not know, where I 
was, nor was able to fpeak a word. . It 
feemed to me iaipoffible that her ma- 
lice could be carried fo far, and that I 
Ihould be accufed of fo black a crime. 
What was more eafy than to prove 
myfelf innocent ? but it would have 
coft me a fecret, that I could not re- 
veal without danger. My trouble and 
filerice, in the mean time, were inter- 
preted, by the Duke, for a certain 
fign of my guilt : Go, Sir, faid he, 
with a tone of voice adapted to encreafe 
my confufion, go, and think on it : 
you have heard my intention, and do 
not make it needful for me to re- 
peat it.

THE time allowed ine ta give a 
i^tisfa<3ory anfwer to the Duke, 
was little better thao the :fhort refpite 
given to condemned criminals, I fliut 
niyfelf up in my room, where 1 broke 
out into many fighj, and fuch a ihower 
of tears that I could cry, even now^ at 
f he remembrance, I was at a lois what 
to think, what . to refolve, what to do * 
J could publifh, faid I, the fliame of 
that jnfanibus intrigue which menaces 
niy ruin; but will they believe my 
words ? asd. where jfhall Ifind witneffes 
for a proof of my perfecuted innocence i 
to juftify niyfelf fully, I muft betray 
the fecret of my fex ; and what will bo 
the confequence, not knowing whofc 
daughter I am ? I may, perhaps, be the 
child of one who would rather have me- 
dead than own ine! if I lofethe afyluin 
of this court, tp what place ihall I fly 
for refuge ? and, who knows, perhaps 
they will not fuffer me to leave Paris ? 
Thefe refle6lions incenfed me fo high- 
ly againflMa^dam Cafardo, the caufcf of 
thcfc 
( i»5 ) 
thefe my fatal troubles, that, in tlie heat 
of anger, I would gladly have embraced 
an opportunity of revenge, even at the. 
hazard of my own life. Defpair and 
anger beficged me in fuch a manner, 
that I did not hear two knocks at the 
door; my lamentations alarmed Mr* 
Befone, who forced open the door, and 
entered. What is the matter, my dear 
lad ? faid he, throwing his arms about 
my neck, what extravagancies are thefe ? 
you are fo much altered, that I hardly 
know you ; but, am I not your friend? 
am I not old enough to be your father ? 
and why do you make a fecret of your 
afBiftion, when perhaps I am able to 
relieve you ? you ft ill have it in your 
power to difclofe to me the grief of 
your heart; and be affured, that, at 
the coft of my own life, I will take 
part in your troubles as if they were 
my own. Being greatly moved by 
thefe expreffions of paternal tendernefs, 
I thanked him with the tears in my 
eyes, and refolved to difcover to him 
my lituation; upon condition, however, 
that he Ihould obferve inviolable fecre- 
cy. I then told him all the Duke had 
faid to me; what I had heard from 
Madam Cafardo in the garden; and 
whatever elfe I could tell him^ as a proof 
R3 <^f 
( i86 ) 
of my innocence, without decfcirin^ 
niyfclf woman. When he had heard 
^11, See, faid he, with horror equal to 
my own, what a woman is capable of, 
who profefles herfelf a woman of ho- 
nour \ for my part-, when I find myfelf 
tinder a neceffity to be cpnverfant with 
the "bufy part of. mankind, Iconfider 
.myfelfasfurrouiided by aflaffins, traitors^ 
and thieves : but, my dear friend, in. 
this cafe, inflead of abandoning your- 
fclf to defpair, you muft confide in. 
your own innocence, and take fuch 
ineafures as are moft likely ta make for 
your acquittance : you may depend on 
me, as on yourfelf 5 and I, promife y ou^ 
from this moment, to do all in my 
power to difcover who is the unknown, 
gallant of Madam Gafardo, who, by 
fcreening himfelf, would bring upon, 
you the confequence of his crime 5 
from this you muft unravel the thready 
of this intricate fcheme, and clear up 
your innocence to the eyes of the 
i)uke. I told him, that Ihad fome fuf^- 
picion that the Buflfoon, who was men- 
tioned in the gsirden as.the contriver of 
fo fcandalous a plot, could be no other 
than that Tartar, of whom we had talk- 
ed tegether that morning. *Tis not un- 
likely, fa,id the good old man, he is, 
capable r 
i 
( i»7 ; 
capable of any thing ; but, if it is fa,, 
ou muft obferve great caution with 
im, not to give him the leaft token of 
your fufpicion, fcft you irritate him. 
the more. I have nothing to do with^ 
him, replied I, and perha;ps never may 
have an opportunity of feoing him. 
again.. Why not ? addfed he, if he h 
an accomplice in this g^ng^ he will ap- 
pear as fuch, and look out for an oc- 
casion to infinuate himfelf with you,, 
and counfel you to comply with the 
Duke's defirc: people of this character 
do not'blufli at their villainy, but are 
ufed to carry two faces j and that with 
which they prefent themfelves, is always, 
the liar : if this affair turns to your 
difadvantage, he will be the firft to 
condole with you on your difgrace';. 
and, difcovering your innocence, hc'lL 
not be the laft to give you joy of your 
good fortune : keep upon your guard,, 
and make good ufe of your prudence... 
By this time, the hour of dinner draw- 
ing near, we went together -into the 
hall. I imagined that Madam Cafar- 
do would not be there, or, at leaft,. that 
Ihe would not have courage to look me 
in the face; becaufe, I fuppofed that- 
fhe could not think on the cruel defign 
Ihe had meditated againfi me, without 
biulhing;: 
( in ) 
biufliing : but fhe had the affurance, 
more than once, to fpeak to me ; and it 
was with the greateft difficulty I could 
ftifte my rage* All my confolation 
confided in the hopes of difcovering 
land in time ; and in 'being able, one 
day or other, to vindicate myfelf. I 
made not the leaft doubt but that the 
Duke had incenfed the Duchefs againft * 
me, by telling her of this affair as he 
thought proper, and giving all poffible 
weight to the accufetion; but I flatter- 
ed myfelf, that fhe would not condemn 
me without hearing;" and to her I 
could fincerely open my heart : in fa<5l, 
the following day flie fent for me, and 
I went fully confident of her goodnefs, 
and my own innocence. Truly, Ri- 
chard, faid ihe, at feeing me, I hear 
firange things of you, which are not 
to be wondered at, confidering the ad- 
vantages your perfon gives you to make 
conquefts : in one thing only I am de- 
ceived, which i?, that I did not believe 
you fo ^,exterous as to coadu<5l an in- 
trigue with fo much fecrecy. Permit 
me. Madam, faid I, to have the hor 
nour to tell you, that to me you attipi- 
bute a talent- to which I have not the 
leaft title : I find that the Duke has gi- 
ten you an account injurious to mj 
honour j 
C i«9) 
honour; but, I affureyou, Madam, I 
am innocent : nothing could be more 
cafy," than to juftify myfelf alfo with 
him ; but I have been willing to fpar6 
the reputation of a perfon who has the 
honour to belong to you, and does not 
merit it if fhe does not fpare herfelf. 
She has raflily proceeded to bhcken 
my charadier, and charity ought firft 
to begin with myfelf. When your 
Grace fliall have heard what I have to 
tell you, you will judge of the accufa- 
tions that are againft me ; and if you* 
find me guilty, I fhall not refufe any 
punifhment that you pleafe toaffign me* 
Here I told the Duchefs the fame 
which I had told Mr. Befone, beginning 
with the adventures of the garden, 
without omitting thofe circumftances 
that rendered my fituation deplorable. 
The Duchefs made no great wonder at 
it J which made me imagine, that, of 
fuch like praftices of her Maid of Ho- 
nour, {he had already had fome proofs. 
It was natural to imagine, facid flie, that 
Madam Cafardo Ihauld rather recur to 
the Duke, than to me; Ihe knows that 
I am no ftranger to her, and that I 
ihould not have lent faith fo lightly to 
her complaints. Though I am forry 
ihe has gained my hulbajid in her far 
vour. 
( ^9^ I 
vour; bccaufe it will not be fo eafy tiy 
make him change his opinion j never- . 
thelefs I fhall fpeak to him, and^ whga 
I find him difpofed to believe nie, lliaH 
not fail to make ufc of what you have 
confided in me. Rely, therefore, upon 
me; I iliall do all poflible to juftify 
you. I bowed, and, with my moll fin- 
cere thanks, took my leave; and went 
. from her chamber to pafs my time in the 
garden, till towards night, as moft fuit- 
able to my melancholy thoughts. And, 
to tell the truth, many were the reflec- 
tions which my capricious defiiny fug- 
gefied to me ! Was there a woman to - 
be found, in a more unhappy fituation 
than mine ? but, above all, it gave me 
trouble, that I could not find out what 
motive Madam Cafardo could have for 
iifing me thus ; knowing my indifFe- . 
rence for her perfon, fhe ought to fore- 
fee, that fuch a black calumny mufl 
render her fiill more hateful to me : fhe 
could not imagine but that, by getting 
her ends, and becoming my wife, Ihe 
would alfo become a vidiim to my juft 
revenge and hatredi Then it could 
not be love that made her a<S in that 
manner, but rather rage, jealoufy^ and 
revenge; a bafe, mifchievons temper, 
that would cry becaufe others laugh, 
and 
(^90 
and "make herfelf miferable becaufe 
others were coi>tent ! My greateft con- 
cern was, that I did not know how to 
extricate myfelf from the danger that 
menaced me from all parts ; or how to 
eradicate the impr^ffion which my per- 
fidious enemy's arts had made on the 
Duke, and difcover the wretch that 
had commerce with her, and who want- 
ed to pafs me as the author of his 
crime* AJl this was impoffibic without 
the particular affiftance of heaven, or 
without running the riik of revealing 
my fex. The night was far advanced, 
nor could one difcern any thing, when, 
in thefe dark thoughts, ftill walking in 
the garden, behind a fort of labyrinth, 
made of ever-greens, my cars were at- 
tra<fted by the voice of two pcrP;ns, who 
were talking together without the leaft 
fear of being overheard : I could nei- 
ther fee nor be feen, bccaufe there was 
between us a thick hedge: I plac'dmy- 
felf attentively, without moving any 
farther, for fear of making a noife 
among the leaves ; and heard one of 
them fay, Now I cannot. : ecaufe I 
iiiuft carry this letter to JMadam, and 
I would give fomething to read it ; if 
one only had a light, I have the cou- 
rage to open and read it, and feal it up 
^ -  again. 
( 19^ ) 
-again, without even the Devil finding 
it out. Here is a light, faid the other, 
taking out of his pocket a piftol tinder- 
box, on which he flruck, and at that in- 
flant a light appeared between the 
leaves. I could then. clearly diftinguifh^ 
that he that had the letter was the vil- 
lainous Buffoon, confidant to the Duke, 
aixi traitor to the- perfon who had en- 
trufted hira with the letter, and to the 
one to whom it was dire<f^ed. Various 
reflections came, at that moment, into 
my mind : I was almoft certain that the 
letter was for Madam Cafardo, and 
that, from the fame, I could find outwho 
was her fecret correfpondent : this fel- 
low who had the letter, I fuppofed, a6l. 
ed between them ; and that, if I had 
that letter, I could have difcovered their 
whole -plot. Encouraged by ^q^ 
thoughts, r could have faced dctdth tktat 
moment, and would have flown to 
them, fword in hand, to vindicate npy 
caufc i but heaven took compi^ffion on 
me, and made me think of a method 
lefs dangerous, and more certain of fuc- 
cefs : I put ity hand to my pocket, and 
pulled forth one of my j^ifiois, which I 
bad- always carried about me; and-thcii 
tbruu it foutly between tli€ buihes, and 
nimcd it dirciftly U . their light, which 
« Aood 
( *93 ) 
flood on a marble pedeftal, on whick 
the traytor had laid the letter while he 
was looking for fomething in his pocket 
to feal it. I immediately let fly to the 
light, and knocked it out with the wind 
of the fhot : the noifc of the piftols 
made the two cowards fcamper off, and 
leave the letter behind them; I yan 
round to the pcdeftal and feized the let- 
ter, which contented me as much as if 
1 had got poffeiRon of a gold mine, 
and, with incredible joy, retired to my 
apartment.

WH E N I got to my chamber, I 
looked at the dire^lion, which 
I found to be for Madam Cai^rdo; I 
opened it to look for the name, but 
found none. The letter was as follows : 
" Madam, 
I am impatient to knowhow vcnir Ita« 
lian withftood the affault from the 
Duke, Tell me, what ihall I do, if our 
fecret v^fits arc to be broken ? or muft 
l.fec you expofed to the lidiculc d the

court? two lines will be fufficient to ac^ 
quaint me , of your iituation ; but do 
not let Tartar lee them, it is not right 
tliat he fliould know every thing. Lore 
me 5 and I am the famefKU." 
I found that this would juftify my In- 
nocence, and prove iatal to Madam 
Cj^rdo ; yet I was forry that I did not 
know who wrote it, I have, faid I, 
compaffed the moft important point; 
the remainder will be managed with lefs 
difficulty. With this confolation I went 
very chearfuUy to fupper, wifliing for 
an opportunity to take Mr. Befone in- 
to my room, afid give him a narrative 
of ^hat had pafled. 
When vTft were alooe, I informect 
him of my adventure, and gave him 
flie letter to read 5 but he no fooner 
faw the letter, than he cryed. Ah ! my 
de^r child, you are entirely loft ! Ter- 
rified with 'this, I afted him the reafon > 
he told me, that the hand-writing was 
that of the Marquis of *  * , nephew 
to the Duke, and that he knew the 
writ mg as well as his own. In what an 
larihappy affair are you embarrafled ! 
this letter is an evident proof of an in- 
trigue between the Marquis and Ma^* 
dam Ca&rdo ;. and if you offer to juf** 
. . ...'.. tlfy 
( 195 ) 
txfy yourfelf to the Duke, it will only 
increafe his anger, becaufe he would 
iiot have the reputation of his nephew 
blafted in fuch an affair, though he 
knew that he was in the fault : and who 
knows, but what the Duke himfelf may 
be a party in this plot, and would have 
you ruined to cover the fcandal of his 
houfe ? 
I afked Mr. Befone, what he would 
advife me to do ? I would have you, 
faid he, go to the Duchefsj Ihew her the 
letter; and tell her, that you would not 
IheW it the Duke, for fear of incenfing 
him againft the Marquis : by thefe 
means, the Duchefs, being convinced 
of your innocence, will always be your 
advocate with the Duke. I promifed 
to obey him ; but had no opinion that 
this would be of ^ny fervice to me, 
knowing, better than he, the fecret rea- 
fons which the Duchefs had, not to 
break with her hulband. Mr. Befone 
then took his leave of me for that night; 
and the day following he came to me, 
defiring me to go and dine with him at 
?he houfe of a relation of his, where 
we' found very agreeable company. I 
promifed ray readers to be finccre, even 
in my failings; and intend to keep my 
word with them. At that dinner, I drank 
S 2 a little 
( X96 ) 
a little more than I ihould have done ; 
but there was a moft agreeable young 
lady, called Mlfs Gianetton, whom 
;Mn Befone had known a long time ; 
and after dinner, to divert her, he play- 
ed feveral airs on the flute, whilft ihc 
accompanied him with her voice ; and 
I, being a little elevated with the liquor, 
did the fame. My friend was fuprifed 
at my capacity, and complimented me 
on the fweetnefs of my voice ; the reft 
of the company did the fame ; and there 
was now no excufe for me, but fing- 1 
inuft, as much as they pleafed. The 
applaufe that I received from all, was 
incredible : they fung almoft all the airs 
of an opera, in which Mifs Gianetton 
had her part; and we did not break up 
till towards night. When we were got 
home, and werefate down tofupper,Ma- 
dam Ca^rdo feemed more difcontented 
than ufual, and I attributed the caufe 
to the lofs of the letter which was fallen 
into my hand : it was not unlikely that 
Tartar, to excufe his own perfidy, 
would endeavour to make her believe it 
to be loft i becaufe he had been feen by 
her, feveral times, feeking about the 
garden, as if he had been looking for 
jfomething which he had really loft.

her, ' and as her honour will be thereby 
fecured from the attacks of fcandal ; Ihe

you fhall know further to-morrow. 
The anfwer was, that Madam was con* 
tent with this appearance, for the prd- 
fent ; upon condition, that I Ihould 
keep my word when the time came, and 
that the Duke himfelf Ihould be fecuri- ' 
ty for my performance of the c^ntrad^. 
Matters DeiHg thus concluded, it was, 
in a few daysr, rumoured, through sill 
the court, thit I was married to Ma-^ 
dam Cafa^o j and I received the com- 
{yliments or all parties accordingly. Was 
not this a fubjedl for a comedy, the moftT 
whimfical that ever made its appearance 
on any ftage ? At this early time of 
life, woriian as I was, I hacl had two* 
wives : the ftrfl was a comfort^ the other 
a hor- 
( 201 ) 
a horror to me ; and even ihc, by her 
fincerc repentance, would have difaf m- 
ed my anger, if other accidents h^d 
not happened, which rendered my 
heart, though naturally tender and 
compaflionate, entirely averfe to her. 
After the publication of my nuptials, I 
never fpoke to Madam Gafardo, unlefs 
it was in company; where, being oblig- 
ed to diflemble, the part was a pleafure 
to me, and to her the greatell torment : 
neither of us exceeded the bounds of 
fimplc civility -, I, becaufe I would not; 
jfhe, not for want of inclination, but, 
becaufe. ihe had not courage to do other- 
wife^ She did not omit, however, to 
give me, continually, the moft fenfible 
proofs of tendernefs i hoping, by de- 
grees, to cahn my juft refentment : a 
day did not pafs, without her fending . 
me fome prcfeat; Ihe did not dare even 
to look up at table 5 every glance of her 
eyes was accompanied by a profound 
figh, and, I may alfo fay, with fome 
tears. 
. This mute language proceeded from 
either her repcntance,or her love, which 
touched me much; and there were mo- 
ments in which I felt compaffion for 
her.^ I did not fail to give infornmtion 
to the Duchefsof what paffed ; and ihe,,. 
who 
( 202 ) 
who had a heart ft ill more tender than 
mine, thought Madam Cafardo was 
fufficiently punilhed by the rcmorfe of 
her own confcience : Mr, Befone alfo 
told me, that, as the condition remained 
inviolable, not to aflbciate with her as a 
huiband, I could and ought to treat her 
with more charity. So much perfua- 
fion was unneceffary, becaufe my heart 
already pleaded in her favour ; and if 
fte had had the courage to break fi- 
lence, her excufes would not haVe been 
badly received ; nor would I, being the 
party offended, be the firft fo to do. 
Thus we continued for fome days, only 
to look filently at each other ; at length, 
over-powered by the tendernefs of my 
nature, I refolved to be the firft ; and, 
it being her birth-day, I got up from 
bed with this intention ; when fhe pre- 
vented me, by fending me, by a foot- 
inan, a bunch of very fine flowers up- 
dn a filver falver : fuch favours I had,* 
at other titties, received from her; but, 
under the flowers,' there was one of an- 
other fpecies, that I flioulii not have cx- 
pe<fted, and which again put my fpirits | 
in frefli confufion. This was a letter ] 
from her, which I opened for curiofity 
to fee. how ihe would juftify herfelf : 
but, alas ! how .was I furprifed, when, 
on 
( 20§ ) 
on feeing the writing, I knew it to he 
like, nay it wai in the very fame hand 
with which thcrtwo letters were wrote 
from my .mother, received by me in 
the convert ^t, Avignon, which I had 
carefully preferved : J immediately 
fearched for them, to confront tliem to- 
gether, and found there was not even 
the difference pf a letter. 
My thought^ were fo confounded, 
that I knew not where I was; not doubt- 
ing in the leaft, from the fimilitude of 
the hand-writing, but that Madam Ca- 
* fardo was my mother : but, alas ! what 
foft of a mother did I find in her? Un- 
happy mel faid I, to myfelf; I no 
longer wonder at her cruelty to others, 
when Ihe is fo inhuman to her own 
child, whom (he would, by force, have 
Ihut up in a cloyfter : fuch a mother 
might well plot againft my honour, who 
had dilhonourcd me even from my 
birth ; and if her prefent pregnancy is 
a crime, that alfo muft have been a 
crime which gave me life : it is for this 
caufe, the perfidious mother has con- 
cealed herfclf even from her daughter : 
for this, fhe would bury me in folitude, 
. to hide, from the eyes of the world, the 
horror of her crime : I had been hap- 
pier 
( ^04 ) 
pier never to have known her, than thus 
to know her only to my ihame ! The 
myftery of my birth, it is true, had al- 
ways foreboded me little good ; but the 
Toad condud of which 1 was certa&i 
Madam Cafardo had been guiky, ex- 
ceeded my worft a^prehenfion^* One 
falfe ftep in a woman well bom, might 
feem pardonable in the eyes of the 
world, and of heaven, when it can, 
perhaps, be juftified by a thoufand in^ 
difpenfable circumftances ; but a ferics 
.of repeated fells, like thofe of Ma- 
dam Cafardo, would admit of neither 
/pardon, or excufe. I rather chofe to 
remain an orphan, abandoned, and 
lunhappy, than confcfs myfelf daughter 
to fuch . a mother !

IT is now time to inforna my readers 
^ of the ccaittiits of th* letter which 
was wrote to jne by Madam Cafardoj 
and which were as follow : . 
" Dear Sir, 
I am "fenfible, -that whatever comes 
from me, ought to be^ in your eyes, 
an objeft of horror ; but bear with mc, 
one moment only, and you will hare 
your revenge. Your diflike to me is 
very trifling, in coraparifon of mjr 
fciultj. very great are the continual 
flings of my agitated confcicuce ^ aixi 
my crime is fo great, that it muft be 
expiated only with my blood. You 
ihall not, much longer, be troubled 
with the fight of my odious perfon;. 
for I am refolved to withdraw myfelf 
from the eyes of all the world : but as 
I cannot, even in folitude, obliterate 
the dear remembrance of you from 
my mind; I am determined there, by 
my own hands, to put an end to my 
milerable life. I Ihall die contented, if 
- you, thereby, have your revenge ; and 
you, in fuch cafe, will be very inhu- 
VquI. ^  ma»' 
( «o6 ) 
hian to deny me your pardon. Ai I 
cxpcift ^ nothing but this from your 
goodncft, in order to the execution of 
my defign j fliould you deny me this 
fevour, to make me die contented, 
heavens pardoh you the fault of render- 
ing more miferable my untimely end, 
I am^ &c. 
Cafahdo. 
I read this letter more than once; and 
it produced in me more compaffion 
than refpe<a. When I refleAed that 
thofe who are capable of one extreme 
may be equally fo of another, the def- 
f erate refolution of Madam Cafardo 
gave me fome difmal apprehenfions. As 
1 thought her life in danger, and, what- 
ever fatal imprudence Ihe might be 
'guilty of, was unwilling to have the 
caufe of it laid to my charge ; I flew 
to her apartment, and found her in a 
fituation not lefs deplorable than flic 
had defcribed in her letter: I found 
her fitting in a melancnoly pofture, all 
tmdrefled, and negle<5led ; her eyes 
fwollen with tears. At firft fight of 
me, (he ftarted up, as if Ihe had been 
ieized with an unexpe<5ted mixtiure of 
joy and grief; Ihe ran to meet me, and, 
felling at my feet, flic embraced my 
knees. 
( 207 ) 
knees, fobbing ajid crying fo loud, that 
Ihe might have been heard in the ftrwK 
I was perplexed to fuch a degree, that 
I almoft repented ray coming. No, 
dear Sir, faid (he, I deferve nothing 
but your hatred j and if I have dcfired 
your pardon, that is enough, without 
your honouring me fo highly witk 
your prefencc : I have flained my own 
reputation, and contaminated yours; 
the horror of ray crime iacreafes in 
proportion to your goodnefs; and yovo* 
goodnefi, at prefent, flings me mor^ 
^ than any thing elfe : by the emotion in 
your countenance, I am ieuiible that 
you feel fome compaffion for nac f and 
if you iave pity for me as your jeud- 
my, let me die by your own band, and 
teach me how revengp is to be taken : 
no, my dear Sir, I will not depart from 
your feet, unlefe you will take this fa- 
tisfa<5lion, which I dare not give youx)f 
pyfelf, through the fear of diihonour^ 
ing you ftill more : kill me with your 
own lunds> that fo I may die glorious, 
rather than live diflionourcd ; and your 
life will become agreeable, as you would 
rather die a thoufand deaths than be- 
come my hufband : what more do you 
wait for? would you have rae arm your . 
hand for revenge ? I have, cpurage to 
T2 do 
( 205 ) 
do it, as I am abfolutely refolved on 
death*—' So faying, ihe ftrctched forth 
her arm to take the fword from my fide $ 
tut i took hold of her, ami, in lifting 
hei* from the ground, faluted her twice> 
Overcome by my fubmiflSon, Ihe fell 
into fnch cxceffire grief, that I was 
afraid Ihe would have fainted in my 
arms : No, Madam, faid I, you fhall 
not do violence onyourfelf : why Ihould 
not I pardon in you a fault, which pro- 
c eeds from your fincere regard for me? 
it is fufficient, that you remember up- 
on what condition I have accepted yo\ir 
hand, and that you are fatisfied that 
we fliall live together as if we were bro- 
ther and fifler. Ah ! Sir, replied flie, 
even this is too much for me ; I am fo' 
far from defiring that you fh6uld troitfi- 
der me as a ^ife, that, at prefent, and 
for ever, I befeech you to confider me 
" as one of your very humble iervahts : 
all I have in the world, is^t your com- 
mand ; but I wifti for nothing of yours, 
except to have the honour to obey 
you: your correfpondence with me*'is 
abfolutely necefTary, to preferve my re- 
putation; but if even this offends you, I 
care not what happens to me, provided 
you are content. She faid a thoufand

( *09 ) 
cd the rage, of a^favage^ and ourdif* 
courfe woyld not have ended, without 
ray declaring myfelf her daughter, if 
another accident had not ha,ppened, 
which kept me, more than ever, at a 
diilance^ The letters from Paris arriv- 
ing, one was brought to her, whick 
ihc received with joy, faying, immedi- 
ately after fhe had read the diredion, 
this comes from Avignon.. My heart 
jumped into my mouth at thefe words, 
and I changed colour; but Madam Ca- 
fardo did not obferve it, becaufe, on 
reading the letter, (he found motives 
therein todifturb her more than me. 
The alteration in her face was fo per- 
ceptible,' that 1 fufpe^ed, immediately, 
what it was ;^ and which increafed my. 
fear. As I was near her, I faw, imjne- 
diately, it was the writmg of the go* 
vemefe of the convent of Avignon: 
the intern^tcd complaints which ihe 
made at not receiving it fooner, per*- 
fiwided me that the letter had remained 
ti(!gle6ted, a bng time, at the poft- 
office; and her conftifion only, nude 
n:ude me believe, at laft, that it brought 
an account of my flight. There was 
no mare occaiion to doubt that Madam 
Caferdo wasa^iually my mother; whi<rh 
lequired the greateft intrepidity in me, 
T3 not 
( 210 ) 
not tcfellin a fwoorii with fear, at her 
feet, «nd betray myfelf* . She had hard- 
fy read the- letter, than Ihe got up, and 
si&ed my kave, faying, that it was ne- 
ceflhry for her to carry thsu: letter to 
the Duke, as it concerned a daughter 
of hfc. I freely confented, wiihing to 
be alone, that 1 might be able to make 
.more ferious refledions on what I had 
iieard and feen. Oh,, miferable mc 1

lunderftand from Madam Cafardo, I 
Jiow know my father ! nor do I at all

CHAP. XXVII. 
The Court goes to Verfailks. A Misfor^ 
tune happtns to the Prince. 
ALTHOUGH Madam Cafer- 
j[\^ do had given me many proofs of 
being fincere with me, but few mimitcs^ 
had pa^ed when. I had new motivK to 
iufpeift her. She had told me, that (he 
'Was obliged to go and comnninicatc the 
letter, from Avignon, to the Dnke^; 
'tut I found, afterwards, that from my 
-chamber flie had gone directly to tHe 
Duchefs, and had tarried; with her' 
above two hours. Having occafion to- 
fpcak to the Duchefs foon after, I found 
htt more thoughtful than ufual, aad 
much out of temper. This was a new 
myftery to me, and added to my for- 
mer doubt, whether Madam Cafardo 
had told me the truth, in faying, that 
the 
( 213 ) 
the fugitive from Avignon was daugh- 
ter to the Duke. During this my per* 
plcxity, the court left Fontarnbleau, 
and went to Verfailles. This was a tiew 
world to me, where every obje<5l' ap- 
peared wonderful : I never, in my life, 
few a more delightful place, nor fp fu- 
perb and magnificent a building. We 
no fooner arrived at Verfailles, than the 
Duchefs inftrufted me where to carry 
and receive letters to and from th^ 
Prince ; this was the firft, if not the on- 
ly thought, that engrofled her atten- 
tion. By fome means or other, the 
Duke had a fufpicion that I was privy 
to this'Correfpondence, and his confi- 
dence m me decreafed every day: I 
c^uld not help fufpefting this, though 
Ijiever could arrive to a certainty, as 
he was too cunning to let his thoughts 
be perceived ; but the confequence con* 
vinced me of it, and it is but ieldoni 
that I am deceived in my conje6tures. 
I did not, at that time, take any great 
pains to come to the bottom of it, ai 
the pleafures of Verfailles diverted mc 
more than ufual, and, by little and lit- 
tle, introduced me to the great world. 
The firft falhionable vice into which I 
launphed, was that of gaming; which 
. was* the principal, nay the fole occupa* 
tion 
( 214 ) 
tlon of every one there. From what I 
had obferved in others, I had fufficient 
motives to take an averfion to gaming : 
It Is be^un as a diverfion, and general- 
ly terminates in a downright profeifion : 
how many are deceived into it at firft, 
who, afterwards, make it their ftudy 
to live by deceiving ? I, every day, 
faw thefe examples; but found few thit 
could profit by thefe my refleilions. 
While I was thus cautioufly taking^.unr 
diverfions, and profiting in the fckoM 
of the world. Madam Cafardo, who 
continued firm in her love for me, ad*- 
vifed me of her fufpicions, that the 
Duke was not pleafed with mis, and that 
Ihe could not penetrate into the rcafon 
of 'it. I imagined that the Duchefs 
niuft have known, and had recourfe to 
her;. but fhe protefled flhe knew no* 
thing of it. But I fuppofc, faid ihe» 
(that the Duke pretends to be angry 
with you, to reduce you, by fear, to 
marry, in reality, your pretended 
fpoufe. 
Who could have imagimxi what S 
barbarous defign he was meditating 
againA me? however, I was not.thj? 
firft vidim to his jealous fury.: buit fa 
induce the reader to believe him ca|)g- 
ble of fucH cruelty, it is nccefl^ry, firft 
I fhould paint his character In ^ proper 
light. 
The Duke of *  * ♦ was, in his fta- 
flure, little: in perfon, pretty fat, full 
of msclignant humours, which the want 
of excrcife occafioned, owing to his be- 
ing fo very fat : he was ahiioft always 
fitting at a little table in his ftudy ; and, 
bccaufe he was ihort-fighted, very of- 
ten fat without any light. This conti- 
nual thinking, and working with his 
brain, had weakened his head in fuch 
a manner, that he was frequently trou- 
bled with the vertigo. He pafled, with 
evfery body, for a man of refined poli- 
cy : but his policy was not always re- 
gulated by honefty j he loved money,' 
and he would put a hundred devices 
to work to fave a few crowns. He 
was a moft refined mafter in the art of 
diffimulation; and woul* deceive peo- 
ple with a fmile on his lips, whilft, in 
his heart, he was meditating their 
death: cxtreamly credulous, and fan- 
ciful, he would make a body of every 
fhade -, and of every accidental word,. 
a myftery. It may eafily be feen, that 
to guard againft a man of this character, 
without firft knowing him, ^as very 
difficult ; and I myfelf did not know 
him, till it was too late. I carried, one 
day, 
( 2l6 ) 
day, a letter to the Duchefs from the 
Prince, in which he fignified, that, by 
ordf r of the King, he was to depart, 
that fame night, for Paris; and that he 
was to return two days after : irf fa6l, 
he departed th^t night ; and, the next 
morning, it was rumoured over all 
Verfailles, that he lay at the point of 
death. It is impoffible to defcribe the 
rage and defpair which the Duchefs 
gave into at this melancholy news; and 
my afflidion was not lefs than hers, ac- 
cording to the obligations I had to fo 
amiable a Prince, whofelifc I would 
have preferved at the coft of my own. 
I could have no peace for this cruel ac- 
cident ; the common account of which 
was, that he,' having departed from 
Verfailles in a poft-chaife, with his va- 
let and one footman only, had been at- 
tacked, four leagues from Paris, by 
four men, mafked, armed with blun- 
derbuffes; that his two fervants were 
killed on the fpot, and he himfelf was 
very, dangeroufly wounded ; and that 
the poftillion, who had the good for- 
tune not to be wounded, had, by dint 
of hard gallopping, brought the Prince 
from ou^ of the hands of thpfe mur- 
derers ; who, having followed in vain 
ibine miles^ at laft turned back. Thus 
the 
( 2^7 ) 
the faft was related in general; but the 
advice which the Prince fent to the 
court, cahned our grief, by letting us 
know, that he was only flightly wound- 
ed in the arm, and that he hoped to be 
hi perfon, in a few days, at Verfailles. 
The court ordered the moft diligent 
enquiry to be made, to find out the 
authors of this enormous attempt; but 
it was all in vain. The Duchefs, who 
was much interefted in that misfor- 
tune, but dared not vent herfelf only in 
my prefence, let flip fome words, from 
which I could comprehend, that flie 
laid the fault upon the Duke, her huf- 
band ; and, to tell the truth, my con- 
je(5\ures were not. different from hers. 
The Duke, notwithftanding, ihewed 
iigns of affliiSlion for the misfortune of 
the Prince ; and, on that occafion, pro- 
fciCed more love to me than ufual. If 
we were not generally blind to the vi- 
ciflitudes of our own deftiny, I ought 
then to 'have been certain, that the 
Duke held me as an aceomplice in the 
correfpondence between th? Prince and 
.the Duchefs, and that fome misfortune 
alfo threatened me;, this, in faft, was 
not far off, as will appear in. the fubfc- 
quent chapter. '

BEING under a neceffity, one

i had but juft entered the Ihady walk, 
when I was aflaulted, fword in hand, by 
two villains, whom I immediately knew 
to be the fame from whom I had taken 
the letter in the garden at Fontainbleau, 
direded for Madam Cafardo : know- 
ing what cowardly wretches they were, 
I couragioufly raifed my voice, and, 
pulling out one of my piftols, I let fly 
at one of them, and would have done 
fo with the other, but my fecohd piftol 
only flaflied in the pan ; and one of them 
advancing, made a thruft at me, which, 
not being in my power to parry, 
wounded me in the left arm : I clapped 
my hand on my fword, refolving to 
defend myfelf to the laft,^ but ex- 
'peftcd nothing but death (though one 
of them was alfo wounded) if Mr. 
Befone, at the report of my piftol, had 
not come up to my defence : feeing me 
in 
( 219 ) 
in this danger, the good old man ruili- 
ed on the two villains fword in hand, 
and wounded them both at the firft two 
thrufts : they did not flay for the fe«- 
cond, but took to their heels. Mr. Be- 
fone being anxious about my wound, 
which feemed to him worfe than it reial- 
ly was, bound it up in the beft manner 
he could, and, making me reft on his 
arm, condu<5ted me back to the palace : 
he alfo knew the two perfidious villains, 
and declared to me on the way his fur- 
prize, fuppofing that they had found 
out that I was the perfon who had taken 
the letter from them at Fontainbeau, 
and that ,this was their private revenge ; 
he imagined fo, becaufe he was igno- 
rant of the fecret reafons which the 
Duke had to hate me ; but I was oblig- 
cd not to mention thofe two infamous 
murderers, becaufe they depended on 
him ; and for many other good reafons. 
The court was u)on informed of what 
had happened to me ; and this affair oc- 
cafioned much talk : every one went to 
Mr. Befone, to be minutely informed 
of the circumftance; and the lovely 
Duchefs took the firft opportunity to 
fly fecrerly to my apartment, to be 
fatisfied ot the flate I was in ; and be- 
ing alTured that the wound was of but 
U2. Uttlc 
( 220 ) 
little moment, ordered me, in the ffrff 
place, not to ftir out of my room ; but 
Kf adam, anfwered I, as a fevour I beg 
It, that you will not deprive me of the 
honour of ferving you, in fpite of all 
the world; I well know that all this is 
on your account, but, when I know it 
favours your intereft, death will alfo be 
glorious to me, I am obliged to you, 
iaid ihe, for your generous fentiments ; 
but, as much as you ar^ difpofed to fa- 
crifice your life for me, fo much the 
more ought I to engage to preferve it : 
if you move out of the houfe, I Ihall 
be in continual fear ; and for which I 
order you not to ftir, if I am not firft 
certain that you can do it with fafetyf: 
I do not know what all this means, and 
when it will end; but here are two hor- 
rible fa<5Vs, one on the back of the other^ 
which put me under the moft dreadful 
apprehenfions. Before the Duchefs 
came, the Duke had fent his furgcon. 
to vifit me; and though my wound gave 
me pain, I refufed to go to bed, as Mr. 
Befone infifted: and I make not the 
leaft doubt, but that every one will ea- 
fily guefs at my reafon. The diflirau- 
lation of the Duke was not new to me, 
but however it did not fail of furprifing 
me; that night I had not courage to 
clofe 
( 221 ) 
clofe my eyes ; and, oh God ! what 
were my reflexions, my fean, and ray 
torments ! at day-break Madam Ca- 
fardo returned to me, who had been 
with me the preceding night, and la^ 
mented at feeing me up fo early : how 
many mnrks did ihe give me of her 
tendemeis, and difpleafure ? I had 
ftrong reafons to fufpeil the Duke, and 
flie gave me to underftand, that her 
Gonjeftures coincided with mine, by 
believing him an accomplice and author 
of this my cruel misfortune : Howe- 
ver this did not induce me to difcover 
my mind. My greateft fecurity in that 
court, confifted in being diffident of 
every one ; but having many doubts 
which I was defirous of clearing up^ I 
dextroufly drew her into difcourfe. 
From the fubjcft of my misfortunes^ 
flie paiTed to that of the Prince ; and 
here it was that I aiked her, what rea* 
fon the Duke could have to attempt, as 
fhe fuppofed, his life ? I will tell you> 
faid Ihe; the Prince was in love with 
the Duchefs, and he was tenderly be- 
loved by her, before the Duke was mar- 
ried : Ihe is, by birth, an Italian 4 her 
parents conducted her very young to 
court, where they made a very great 
figure i ihe grew up, as I may fay, 
U3 with 
( 222 ^ 
with the Prince, and with him was edu- 
cated ; fo that, according to their re- 
ciprocal inclinations, they had defiined 
her as^his fpoufe : the court interpofed 
to break this marriage, and policy 
alone, which is the arbitrator and ty* 
rant of the great, obliged the parents 
of the Duchefi to give her in marriage 
to the Duke, who, for his age, might 
be fuppofed her father infiead of her hus- 
band : this marriage was to her a facri- 
fice that had very near coft her her life. 
The Duke, in the firft month of his 
marriage, was fent an ambailadpr to 
the court of Madrid, and the Duchefs, 
by the pretext of her indifpofition, pre* 
vailed upon him to leave her in Paris : 
you may very well imagine, that her 
tendernefs for the Prince, inflead of 
being lefs, increafed in the ab&nce of 
her hufband. Six months after (he was 
married, and five oaly after the depar- 
ture of the Duke, Ihe, unexpcdedly, 
took it in her head to go to Madrid, 
and in a few days we were obliged to get 
every thing in. order for her departure : 
what was the reafon of this unexpedcd 
refolution, I am very well acquainted 
witl% though I ought not to men- 
tion it ; nor Ihall it ever be known. In 
Spain we did not^ arrive fo foon, becaufe 
ihe would firft mik^ an excurfion into 
Italy; 
( 223 ) 
Italy; and, being obliged by her in-* 
difpofition, which accompanied her all 
the way, Ihe flopped ahiioft two months 
in Rome, entirely private, and, I may 
fay, that even the air itfelf did not 
know it. The reft of the family were 
fent by fea; with her, there were none 
but me, and Madam Fralle her other 
maid, with whom Ihe afterwards part- 
ed, becaufe, ihe pretended, that the 
Duke, her hufband, had a daughter by 
that woman. We were hardly got to 
Madrid, when fuch difference arofe 
between her and the Duke, that, from 
that time, they have lived in the man- 
ner you now fee. By this narrative, I 
got a little infight of the matter, nor^ 
could I have dared to promife myfelf 
fo much. If the reader goes through 
thefe memoirs, he will fee, that Ma- 
dam Cafardo had not told me all ; but 
ihe confeffed that, to conceal a fecret 
known only to her, Ihe might not fay 
any more. I *no longer doubted but 
thatt his was the Princefs of whom Duli 
had fpoken ; I knew by him that Ihe had 
been brought to bed in his houfe, of a 
daugther; ; and this account of the fup- 
pofed indifpofition of theDuchefs agreed 
with what Madam Cafardo had told me. 
Thu$*far did not feema little in. regavd 
to 
( 224 ) 
to myfelf ; but as Madam Fralle, the 
Duchefs's maid, was difcharged by her 
becaufe the Duke had a child by her, it 
feemed to me as if I had found a mo- 
ther in her. The Duke, thought I, had 
a daughter by Madatn Fralle j this 
daughter, according to all appearance, is 
run away from the convent of Avignon : 
then I am this wretch | and I can now 
fay, that I know who are my parents. 
I looked upon the force of this argu- 
ment as invincible ; and though of my 
birth I had nothing to glbry in, yet, 
knowing that Madam Cafardo had no 
part whatever therein, it made me lefs 
unhappy. A very great doubt how- 
ever remained, which gave me no little 
trouble ; if Madam Fralle was my mo- 
ther, how could the letter, wrote to me 
by my mother when I was at Avignon, 
be the felf-fame hand- writing with that 
of Madam Cafardo ? of which there 
was not the leaft doubt. To gain a far-^ 
ther light in this intricate affair, which 
I could not^et only by means of Ma* 
dam Cafirdo, I aiked her, as if by ac- 
cident, what became of Madam Fralle? 
Ihe told me, that the Duke had married 
her to a dependant of his, and that four 
months ago Ihe died in child-bed. By 
thb I knew nothing more than before; 
though 
( 22$ > 
tliough I imagined, that, not to give 
^her hufband any fufpicion, ihe had got 
fomebody to write for her; and that 
fbc made nfe of Madam Cafardo rather 
than any body elfe, fhe being acquaint- 
ed with her fault, and enjoyed the fa- 
vour of the Duke, from whence it was 
natural to think my maintenance came. 
Upon the whole, I did not know how 
to go further with my conje<5tures ; but 
fuch as^ they were, they gave me no 
confolation. What did it avail know- 
ing who was my father, if, in my fa- 
ther, I found a tyrant, wIk), perhaps, 
repented of having given me life, and 
was now menacing my death? This 
and the like reflexions, prevented me 
from enjoying any peace of mind in that 
family, and made ma refplve to get as 
far off* as I poflibly could : I wanted a 
pretence to leave the amiable Duchefs, 
without giving offence, and this I 
thou^t I had found; in confequence of 
the misfortune that had befallen me, I 
could bring for an excufe, the continu- 
al danger I was in there of ray Hfe : I' 
communicated my thoughts to Madam 
Cafardo, who, truly loving me, was in 
more terror than me, and who was not 
wanting, in her advice, to contrive for 
my faiFety. For charity, faid Ihe, put 
an 
( 226 ) 
an end to my fears, and to my tears  
retire from a place fo fatal for you, nor 
let the Duke know to what part you 
are gone : though your abfence will be 
J)ain to me, yet, knowing you are in 
afety, that pain will be alleviated : do 
not fail writing to me, and any thing 
you defire me to do,, Ihall be pun<5lually 
accompliflied: fly; begone, as foon as 
poflible ; every moment you ftay is a 
torment toT me : for I think I fee thofe 
murderers in fearch of you. Madam 
Cafardo's good perfuafions were alfo 
joined by thofe of Mr. Befone ; and 
they found no great difficulty in per- 
fuading me to depart from the court, 
for I thought I Ihould be in continual 
danger till I left it j yet I well knew, 
that, in the prefent circumftances, the 
Duchefs would have occafion for my 
affiftance; and, to prevent any other 
perfon, in my place, from betraying fo 
good a miflrefs, it was abfol utel jr ne- 
celTary that I alone Ihould carry on tkeir 
correspondence.

My Departure from the Duchefs. 
AT the end of ten days my wound 
was fo v/sll healed, that I found 
myfelf able to undergo the fatigue of 
a journey. I went, very early in the 
niorning, to the Duchefs's apartment, 
and, throwing myfelf at her feet, with 
tears in my eyes, begged of her to per- 
mit me to quit her fervice ; that not 
only my life was in danger, but her fe- 
cret correfpondence with the Prince, 
j fhould they aflaffinate me at a time- 
» when I had any letter of hers in my 
I hands, might be difcovered ; which 
! would occafion the fury of the Duke to 
fall upon her likewife : now, Madam, 
fay yes, or no: if you order- me to 
ftay, I Ihall obey your commahds, 
willing to lofe a thoufand lives, was it 
in my power, for fo amiable a ipiflrcfs : 
command me. Madam ; for. to die in 
your fervice, will be an^ honour to me. 
No, dear Richard, replied the Duchefs; 
I fhould never forgive myfelf, Ihould 
you lofe your life :in my fervice ; and 
Ihould for ever upbraid myfelf for be- 
ing the occafion of. your death : for 
me you have already fuffered enougk, 
and 
. ( 2^.t) 
and it would be ungrateful In nte to-fet 
any further mifchier happen 'to you on 
my account : Go; though your depar- 
ture will be a continual concern to me^ 
heaven, I hope, will forgiv6 me, for 
parting with you in fo hard an extre- 
mity : teil me, however, where are 
you going ? and what is your- defire ? 
lor it will be a pleafure for me tb fct 
your merit rewarded ; and I will affift 
you to the beft of my ability. ' TJirs 
generous offer, 2nd the thoughts of 
Italy, where the Count was, gav& fiie* 
an ppportunity of telling her, that' I 
dqiired to return to my friends ihhaly, 
in a creditable manner, that they might 
not fay my journey to. Paris had prov- 
ed to my difadvantage. Well, faid the 
Duchefs, the Marihal of **, who 
commands the French army, is now in 
Italy ; when you leave this place, you 
will call at Paiis, and I will o;}ve you a 
letter for the Prince, who will recom- 
mend you to the Marfhall, with whom 
he is intimately acquainted; and, with- 
out doubt, you will be advanced in the 
army. She immediately fat dowrt to 
write me the letter : while Ihe was wri- 
ting, the thoughts of advancement ran 
but little in my head ; what I aitvied at 
was, to furprize the Count when- he 
leaft 
( 229 ) 
Icaft expeAcd the light of me. When 
.the fetter was finiihed, (he prefented it 
to me, and embraced me with a mo* 
therly tendemefs, calling me, more 
than cmce, her dear child, and faid, 
ihe always loved me as a mother^ not 
as a mifhrefs. Oil leaving the Duchefs, 
I vifited Madam Cafardo, to let her 
know (rf my departure the following 
day. She told me, that (he was glad of 
it, notwithftanding her love for me ; 
thinking that,, as long as I continued 
there, my life was in danger. She 
ihewed me all her money and jewels, 
and told me, that it -was all at my fer- 
vice. - Not having occafion for any, I 
told her I was obliged to her : but (he 
infifted upon my acceptance of two 
hundred Louifd'ores, and told rac, 
whenever I had occa(ion for more» to 
fend to her, and I (hould have them. I 
returned her thanks for her bounty, 
told her I had thirty thoufand livres, 
and that I would depo(it in her hands 
the half, and that the remainder would 
be fu(ficient to travel with : I took my 
leave of her, and then waited upon the 
Duke, though, in my heart, I had a 
moft juft refentmerit againft him, and 
dared not (hew it. His ol liging terms 
did not furprife me in the leaft ; know«

that I could not look out from.it;; ymc

adorned with pi<fturcs : a compamoD^ 
or a book, would have diverted my 
i^elancholy thoughts, but, ddlctute o{ 
either, I refigned myfelf to the willof 
heaven, and refolved to fix an entire 
dependance on Providence, which alone 
could enable me to fubdue the greateft 
affliAions ; and ray greateft fatisfa6tion 
was^ that I had not committed any 
crime. In this difmal fituatiai* three 
weeks pafled without my efeV hearing 
liuman voice, or feeing any perfon, 
except him who brought me necefla-

he fpoke not one word the whole time. 
One night I was awakened by a noife 
agaihft the wall, at the head of my 
bed ; I ftarted up with fear, and, liften-

feemed to be at a diftance, and called

iaid (he, this is not owing to the heat 
of my temper, or the blind tranfports of 
an amorous paffion ; I have long 
thought, and am continually thinking 
of it ; and that you may be convinced 
how much I confide in you, you arc

At. the name only of Avignon my

to me to ferve her. I coyld not help 
fufpeding that it was^ fomething con-

moft confcquence; fhe being di(|ulled

( ^55 ) 
|>y Madam Fralle^ . waitin»-mard to tht 
JDuchefi, and this child is tncfouncfatiort 
pf her fchenic of feparating from the 
Duke : this girl has been left in Avig- 
non to be educated, without being per- 
mitted to kiiow who were her parents : 
within thefc few months fhe has eloped 
from Avignon, and, if flie cantiot be 
found, this fcheme of the Duchcfs will 
prove abortive: you arc to go to Avig- 
non in fearch of her, and, if flie is not 
there, you muft come back to teftify 
that ihe has been there, that fhe is ran 
away, and is not to be found: thfr 
thing is eafy for you, being a cntaiA 
truth which cannot be doubted^ fbr ihe 
has been there fix hionths ago$ but» 
dh Duchefi ! I can almoft fortitell what 
will happen in this cafe: the Duke, 
finding himfelf attacked iA this man* 
ner> will ahfolutely defend, himfelf^ 
and it will be no difficult matter to de- 
ny a h6l that is but now firfl publiflif 
cd 5 therefore this will be of no preju- 
dice to him : thofe who feek, very of- 
ten find what they little expefl: -, and 
fhe, in trying to difcredit her hulband, 
will only difcredit herfelf. 
TThefc refleftions, anfwered I, are 
very juft, and I wonder you do not 
mention them to the Duchefs herfelf, « 
Z2 to 
' to 3rivc fuch dangerous thoughts froni 
her mind: Madam Cafardo faid Ihe 
iad, but from her mouth they did not 
jprevaii, the Duchefe fuppofing that it 
was fear diftated' them. Po you try, 
faid ihe, if you can prevail with her; but 
I doubt it, becaufe (he never told y0^ 
all that is paft j nor can you fpeak^to 
her like nie, becaufe I know what yff\x 
do not. To this, faid I, I cannot an-^ 
fwer, for there are fecretJ that the wo.-i 
jnerr never will betray ; when once they 
iiave entertained an opinion, it is har4 
to remove it j and the difguft Ihe. haV

My DeparJure frMi Paris, ami tbeC^Je^ 
quenc€s ibere^f. 
WH E N I had got about forty 
leagues diftance from VerfaiHes, 
the axle-tree of my chaife, by a fudden 
jolt* broke in the middle; and while 
the poftilion was repairing the damage, 
a gentleman on horfe-back rode up to 
me, and alighted from his horfe to af- 
fift me ; but feeing that it would take 
fome time to put it in order, and that 
it was impoflible for me to arrive at 
Valenciennes before night, he kindly 
offered me fuch accommodation as his 
houfe afforded, and which, he told me, 
was not above the diftance of a muiket- 
(hot from that place, and promifed, in 
the mean time, to get my chaife mend- 
ed as it ought to be ; and to-morrow, 
faid he, you may proceed on your jour- 
ney. This obliging offer, to a perfon 
in my circumftances, could not fail of 
being agreeable; and though his ap- 
pearance ^ve me no very favourable 
ideas, he expreffed himfelf with fo 
much civility, that I could not refufe 
his invitation. His head was covered 
with a wig^ which looked like fpua- 
yarn ; 
I 
I 
( 2165 ) 
jarri ; his coat was ferge^ of a Frier's 
grey, whicK fecfmed to have been turn- 
ed** tBi% years ago ; feis waiflcoaf vfAs 
laced with gold, but looked older than 
himfdf; his breeches were grey linen; 
and, in Aort, between 'his owii ^garm 
a:nd that of his horfe, there was llttic 
difference ; for, the horfe looked as 
poor as hiinfelf. We walked together a 
confiderable way, and, at laft, arrived 
at a tong valley, from whence I could 
difcovfr'Mr. AUiot's houfe, which was 
not higher than a hay-ftack. I do not 
conduS you, faid he, to a Louvre, ot to 
Vcrfailles; but to thehoufcrof a poor 
gehtlerhanj where you ihall not want a 
good- bed, nor any necef&ry rcfrefli- 
went?. With* fuch like dilfcourfes wc 
arrived at his houfe. In truth, he tolel 
me no lye, in faying that he did not 
conduft me to the Louvre, or to Ver- 
failks.j for his yard was full of dirt, 
and lumbered with ftraw 5 and I fcraped 
my ihoes, to go into a room full of 
rubbilh : on my entry, I was compli* 
mented by Madam AlJiot, who, turn- 
ing to her huiband; asked him, if he 
was not alhanied to bring me into fuch 
an incommoded houfir? Soon after, 
his nephew came in, with a large par- 
cel of woodcocks, quails^ and other 
Vol, ! A a game.

I'fufpeft that Mr. Alliot would accom.- 
panyme, but he inflffed that he vnould, 
and.wc.arrived both together ait-Valen- 
cienncs ; from whence we proceeded to 
the famout abbey of St. Williim-^ and 
jyiri Alliot, as. if he had beai raafter, 
gave orders to unharaefs the horiJes, and 
put them in the Abbot's: ftables, and 
then defited to fee the Abbot ;: when he 
caaw out, Mr. Alliot made :hiin a very 
low bow, tcllii:^ him, that, he was- 
charged to acconapany that young gen- 
tleman (meaning me) to fee the moft 
curious places in the province, and that 
he thought it his duty to fliew him thc 
fainous abbey of St. William j there- 
fore hoped'to be excufed fan this liber- 
ty. The courteous Abbot replied^ that 
i^was' doing him a. particular favour j 
and immediately conduced us intb, a 
genteel- apartment, vwhieh he ofered us 
foTOe. refreftiment; No, no; replied 
Mr. Alliot, we'll keep our ftoraachsfor

in your garden to gain us an appetite. 
Gentlemen, faidthc Abbot, I will keep 
you company. We are obliged to you, 
replied Mr. Alliot, but don't difturb 
yourfelf, nor us neither. Though Mr. 
AUiot's difcourfe was quite free and un- 
polilhed, it was fo natural, and accom- 
panied withfo niuch affability, that no 
one could take it amifs. 
CHAP. XXXVI. 
^ My yirrhal at Turin. 
MY companion, aifter leaving me 
fome moments in the garden, re- 
turned, faying, that we ftioiild ihave an 
elegant fupper, for there were two 
difties which the Abbot was very fond 
of; and if the cook did not drefs them 
.properly, the I-»ord have mercy on him. 
In truth, we had a fine fupper ; and 
Mr. Alliot affured me, that he would 
engage I fhould be more elegantly en- 
tertained the next day. To this I re- 
plied, that I muft abfolutely depart the 
next day, and proceed on my journey. 
There is no occafion for fuch hurry, 
feys he i here is plenty of the beft pro- 
A a 2 vifion. 
( 268 > 
vifion^ and nothing to pay for it hut 
good words. This fort of oeconomy 
did not agree with my fpirit; but I had 
.to do with a man from whom 1 knew 
not how to.difengage myfelf. At length, 
however, I found an excufe to depart 
in two days from the Abbey. I thought, 
if I left it without ihewing fomc token 
of my gratitude, I fhould feem ungen- 
teel J and therefore I took.occafion to 
fpeak to the Abbot alone, and prefent 
him with a gold fnuff-boX, given to 
nie by Mr. D'Arcorc, and which was 
worth .about feventy ducats. The 
ceconomy of my companion, on this 
occafion, made me prodigal; and al- 
though my liberality might exceed pro- 
per bounds, I ihould have rather been 
quite poor, than have fhewn myfelf 
mean-fpirited, or afled ungratefully. 
In the evening we arrived at Mons, and 
I feigned to go to Bruflels the next morn- 
ing; by this means I got rid of Mr. 
Alliot, who returned to Valenciennes. 
Before I fet out. on my journey, I wrote 
a letter to Madam Cafardo; in a cha- 
ra^^er copied from Mr. Befone's book, 
that my true hand- writing might not be 
difcovered: Igave her the reafonofmy 
fudden departure ; defiring her to find 
out the fentiments of the Duchefs con- 
cerning 
certing me, and to write to nie at Turin, 
\^ithout infonning any one whdre I wai , 
I would willingly have wrote to Mr. 
D' Arcore, but was fearful of being dif- 
coycred, and deteraiined to diefer it till 
my arrival in Italy. 
From Mons to Turin, nothing hap- 
pened worthy o^ attention. The fitua* 
tion and beauty of that city, I will not 
fayJt furprifed me, but it pleafed me 
extreamly : if there were not not mag- 
«ificefit palaces, as in Paris, and in 
other cities of Italy, yet the ipaciout 
nefs of the ftreets, andf regularity of the 
buildings, exceeded what was to be feen 
in other places. I took a lodging with 
intent to flay fome time at Turin, that 
I might get an anfwer from IVIadam Ca- 
fardo, to know what was faid of me at 
that court. Being one night at the ope- 
ra, I went into the ftage^-box, and was 
furprifed at being ialuted by one of the 
fingers as if Ihe had known me before : 
I could not, by her face, find out who 
flie was ; till I rofe up, and went from 
my box to the fcenes, when, coming 
iiigh her, I knew her to be Mifs Gia- 
netton, Mr. Befone's friend : I was fur- 
prifed to fee her in that way of life, 
neither had Ihe time to teH me any 
thing, but defired the fevour of my 
company when the opera was ended. 
Aa 3 Accord- 
\ 
(270) 
Accordingly I went to the door to wak 
for her; and when (he came out flie 
took nie by the arm, as is common with 
^ladies of her profeffion, and made me 
ilep into the coach, which conducted 
us to her houfe. A diftmftion of this 
nature made every one believe that I 
was a favourite of that beauty, and had 
made a conqueft of no little moment : 
I heard an obfervation of this fort, as 
we were going into the coach ; at which 
ihe laughed, and I, in my own mind^ 
had more reafon to laugh than (he. I 
Ihall fay nothing of her apartment, on- 
ly that it was compleatly furniiliedj 
and before I had the honour of being 
noticed, I muft wait till Ihe undreffed 
at her leifure, to give me an opportu- 
nity of feeing her wardrobe 5 and, un^ 
der pretext of wafliing her hands, (he 
fliewed me her toilet, which was adornr 
cd with a variety of filver trinkets : if 
Ihe had fpared this trouble, it would 
have done her more honour ; wealth of. 
this fort, procured in fo fliort a time, 
I fufpe<Jled, muft have been got in no 
very creditable manner. After having 
given me this oftentatious difplay of her 
riches, which certainly were not the 
fruits of. a rigorous virtue, Mifs Gia- 
netton infifted on my flaying tofupwith 
htr, and entertained me like a Prince : 
at 
( 271 )] 
at this I did not wonder, as I well kneur 
that people of the theatres were gene- 
rally very extravagant. That air of 
feigned greatnefs, which they aflume on 
the ftage, is not forgot when on plain 
ground j and in domeftic converfation, 
they aim to mimic their, fuperiors, 
with a contempt for all others, which 
renders- them truly ridiculous. Mils 
Gianetton was not old in the art, yet fhe 
had adopted all thefe prejudices, as if 
fhe had been of the profeffion from her 
childhood. When fupper was over, I 
took my leave of her, and the next 
morning my pretended conqueft was 
rumoured aUiover Turin. 
The idle life which I led at Turin, in 
waiting for the letters from Paris, made 
me confider the converfation of Mifs 
Gianeitpn, and the talk of the country, 
as a paflime, which a little flattered my 
vanity ; I continuing to vifit her, flie 
continued to diftinguilh me . whether 
it was through the aiFe£tion which Ihe 
conceived for me (as I afterwards found) 
or with the hopes of gaining advantage, 
as the women of her charafter do, by 
being fo intimate with me, ihe torment- 
ed me in fuch a manner with her kind- 
nefs, that ihe would not leave me one 
hour's liberty ^ I paffed whole days at 
her 
1 
( 272 ) 
fier houfe, bccaufe it was ddightfuf, 
-and her converfation lively ; and bc- 
caufe I had no other acquaintances 
there, every one envied my happinefs^ 
and at their envy I laughed ; but had 
I forefeeti what was to happen, I ihould 
hare had little caufe to glory, and they 
lefs to envy me.

Plundered hy a Servant, and affijied wBere 
lleaft txpeSled it. 
ON E night, when I had remained' 
later than ufual at Mifs Gianet-r 
ton's, I waited for my footman to. come 
with a light, beeaufe the night was dark 
and rainy ; and not having feen him 
from twelve o'clock that day, I judged 
he was got in liquor, and did not think 
how late it was : after having waited 
till paft midnight, I went home by my- 
felf, refolving to difcharge him the next 
morning : I had the key of my apart- 
ment, which had no conne<ftion with 
any other part of the houfe^ and, as 
there was no light, I was obliged to 
ftrike one : in undreffing myfelf, I had 
occafion to go into my clofet where I 
put my cloaths, which I opened with a 
beating heart, as if I had forefeen the 
villainy 
( 273 
.villainy, when, to my furprize, I foxind 
it empty ! I immediately ran to the bu- 
r^u, where I put my linen, and all 
^my jewels, and money ; I found it 
broke open, and not the value of a half- 
penny left ! Oh God, how was I ftruck 
motionlefs at this fight ! the tears came 
into my eyes, and I was ready to drop 
into a fwoon at this fudden misfortune : 
my perfidious villain of a footman had 
plundered me pf all 5 for having a key 
of my apartment, he went in and out 
as he pleafed, with an excufe of putting 
it in order. Thus I lofl every thing 
but what I had upon my back ; I had, 
it is true, the gold watch the Prince 
gave me, but very little money in my 
pocket. My fituation was moil deplo- 
rable; and the only defperate council 
my confufion fuggeiled to me, was, how 
to proceed on my journey to Lom- 
bardy, where the French army was ; 
how to fubfift in Turin, till I had back 
the money I left with Mrs. Cafardo; 
and who to run to, at that hour, to get 
fome account of the villain, or from 
whom to get any thing towards my 
fupport. The fum I had loft was not 
trifling ; for I brought with me, from 
Paris, as much as would have maintain- 
ed me fome years : what I had remain- 
ing 
( 274 ) 
iflg was but little 5 one half I muft ex- 
pend to equip myfelf for my journey, 
and to make a competent figure in the 
army; the other half wouldbeexhauft- 
.ed in travelUng expenees : 1 fhpuld have 
-nothing to help myfelf m tinieof need. 
With thefe uneafy thoughts I pafled 
the whole night, and not one foul to 
comfort me 5 I owed the landlady for 
two weeks board, nor had I another 
ihirt to (hift myfelf when the 6ne I had 
*ojl was dirty ;. and to appear in genteel 
company, it was neceflary lihould make 
a decent appei^ance* The news of my 
misfartune was, the next morning, fpread 
<aU ovier .(ihercity; but no oneo^ed me 
ijhe loan of a ifin^ ducat. :I was fitting 
Jin a coffee-houfe, receiving the fruit- 
lefs compaffiLon of others, when, at 
about twelve o'clock at noon, I was 
trailed afide 1i>y a perfon, of whom, du- 
ring the paft night, I had not, in my 
confufion,. entertained leven the ieaft 
thought; this perfon was no other than 
Mifs Gianetton, who can?w and conduc- 
ed me to her own habitation, with the 
tears in her eyes, lamenting my fad mif- 
fortune : it is impoflible to exprefs th» 
various methods Ihe made ufe of to lef- 
fen my troubles, which almoft depriv- 
ed me of my fenfes.. Her expreflion& 
and 
( 275 ) 
and a(^ibns, being correfpondent with 
each other, convinced me of the fince- 
rity of her ijntentions : I always Believ- 
edy that in women of her profeffion, 
vile intereft was their ruling patffion; 
but on this occafion, I was very certain, 
that, in Mifs Gianetton, love prevailed : 
it.affe<9:ed her lefs in making me the of- 
fer of» one hundred piftoles of her own 
to fupply my neceffity, than it did me 
in accepting of (hem. The neceffiy, 
however, to which I found myfelf re- 
duced, obliged me, though contrary 
to my inclination, to embrace her offer; 
nor was this all, for Mifi Gianetton 
Ihewed herfelf ftill more generous to- 
wards me; and doubting whether the 
fupply I was in expedation of from Pa- 
ris, was not a pretence, Invented byjue 
to conceal my fhame, fhe infilled upon 
immediately providing me with all ne- 
ceffaries: I oppofed her refolution, but 
in vain ; and not to affront her, w«s 
forced to let her a<ft as ihe pleafed. 
^Having accepted what I wanted under 
the title of borrowing, and upon con- 
dition of reiraburfement as foon as pof- 
fible, I wrate^ tOiMadam Cafardo of my 
ftate, related to her- how much Fvtras- 
indebted to my benefai^refs, and 
begged Ihe would rejiiiit mc the money 
^ ^ I left

(276) 
I Jeft in her hands, to fatisfy the obli- 
gations I was under. 
lu a fc\r days after Miis^ Gianetton 
had obliged nie in this particular man- 
ner, Ihe acquainted me, that Ihe had a  
great regard for my perfon, and, in 
Ihort, that flie wias willing, if agifeca- 
ble to myfelf, to become my wife : I 
was not a little fufprifed at her propo- 
fal, and knpw no better method to bring 
myfelf off with honour, than by telling 
her, that I already had a wife at Ver- 
failles, from whom I was not feparated, 
though my duty at prefenC called me to 
the army. I dreaded the confequences 
which even this reafonable excufe might 
produce, fuppofmg Mifs Gianetton to 
be really in love with me; but I found, 
to my great fatisfadion, that her affec- 
tion had not taken very deep root. 
Her view was, by marrying me, to en- 
large the profits of her profeffion as a 
finger, to which Ihe thought my know- 
ledge of mufic would be no fmall addi- 
tion : fhe was defirous, as I before ob- ' 
ferved, of mimicking her betters in * 
grandeur and magnificence; aad let flip 
no opportunity in her power to fup- 
port that charaxfter.

LetUrs received from VerfailUs ; and new 
Dangers of my being difcoverei at 
Turin. 
SOME days after my misfortune 
at Turin, I was informed, by good 
authority, that Count Tcrmes was with 
his regiment in Pavia , I had a great 
\ inclination to write to him, to give him 
I another proof of my conftancy : it was 
requifite for me to write in fuch a man* 
i jier, that he might not find out where 
I was ; accordingJy I fat down^^ and 
wrote to him as follows : 
'' Dear Sir, 
This is the fecond Letter that I write 
you, without acquainting you of the 
place of my abode, or what is the rea» 
fon for niy concealing it from you. 
Wherever 1 am, it is fufficient to inform 
you, that I love you as much as ever; 
and rely upon the honour of your pro- 
mifes. With thefe hopes, I flatter my- . 
felf, that in a few weeks we fliall fe^ 
each other, and will inform you m per- 
jfon of what I dare npt in writing, I 
^m all at your fervice, ^^ ^ 
V^L.I. Bb Not 
( 278) 
Not only this, but the other letter 
alfa fell into the Count's hands, as I 
Was afterwards informed, though both 
were rather caufe of.fnqllie^ude than 
content to him. My intricate method 
of writing kept him utterly in the 
dark j and if I had explained myfelf 
more clearly, even in this laft letter, I 
fliould have feen him a great deal 
fooncr, and my troubles would not have 
begun at a time when I expefted they 
would have been finifhed. Carrying 
the letter to the Poft-office, I found one 
from Paris, wrote to me by Madam 
Cafardo, in anfwer to that I fent from ~ 
Mons. You may eafily believe with 
what eagernefs I opened it, to know- 
how the Duchefs proceeded after my 
fudden departure ; and my heart beat 
with the apprehenfion of hearing the 
Duchefs*s exclamation agaiiift me: but 
how agreeably was I difappointed, when 
I found all contrary to what I expeft- 
cd. The firft thing which prefeated it- 
fclf to my eyes, was a Bill of Exchange, 
of four hundred piftoles, inclofed there- 
m. The contents were as follow : 
' *< Sir, 
. ;My concern for your departure ii 
greatly diminilhed by the news that you 
gave 
I 
( 279 ) 
gave me of your health and fafcty. 
The Duchefs would have reafon to be 
angry at your condui^l:, provided her 
regard for you was lefs ; but her love 
has expelled every principle of refent^ 
ment from her heart, and her utmoft 
wiih is to know to what place you arc 
flown. Her difcords with the Duke 
are ftill the fame, and fhe has not laid 
afide the thoughts of feparating from 
him ; but being deprived of your aflift- 
ance, has taken other methods of pro- 
ceeding. In the mean time, that you 
may not be ftraightened in your ex- 
J)enfive journey, I fend you a bill of 
our hundred piftoles, without diml- 
nilhing the capital left in my hands* 
And, with afliirance of my tender af- 
fe<ftion for you, I am always the 
fame. 
CAFARDO.^r 
Confidering what had pafled between 
me and Madam Cafardo, her genero- 
fity furprifed me much : ihe gloried in 
alluring me, by thefe prefents, of the 
iincerity of her repentance 5 and tho*, 
at firft, I hated her through revenge, 
yet to love her for this token of her af- 
fedion, was now a duty incumbent on 
me. The account of the Duchefs's 
bounty 
( 2«0 ) 
bounty towards me, and the timely af^ 
liftancc of the money fent by my fup- 
pofed fpoufc, without my aiking for it, 
or fhe knowing the necefSty I was in, 
were equally a comfort to me. I was 
anxious, in the firft place, to repay the 
money to Mifs Gianetton. 
On the morning that I prefented to 
Mifs Gianetton, unexpcftedly, the one 
hundred piftoles which (he had lent nie^ 
and fifty mbre which Ihe had laid out 
In cloaths for me, ihe was greatly afto- 
jiiihed at it well knowing that the an- 
.fwer to my letter, wrote to Paris, could 
ftot be arrived yet : fhe knew not what 
10 think, nor qpuld conceive where I 
borrowed that fum, ihe feid to affront 
"her i and, to^fatisfy her, I was obliged to 
ifhew her the letter from my wife : this 
.convinced her of the faft ; but flie had 
no fooner entered the play-houfe in the 
evening, than fhe indulged her vanity, 
\>y acquainting the other aflors of my 
punftuality in repaying what fhe lent 
me, and of the large remittance which 
I received from France, reprefenting it 
as double the value of what it was ; and 
the opinion they entertained of me, in 
cofifequence of this change in my cir- 
cumflances, might be eafily perceived 
by their behaviour. 
▲ 
< 28l ) 
A few days after I received another 
letter from Madam Cafardo, in an- 
fwer to that I wrote from Turin, and, 
in bills, the fum of money I had wrote 
for. I was now again in a ftate to make 
a decent appearance in the world, and 
to proceed on my journey for the ar- 
my : I would not flay to look after 
what I was rob'd of; Mifs Gianettort 
perfifted on my flaying in Turin till the 
icafon for the operas was orer, aftet 
which Ihe would go with mc to Italy i 
this M/as fuffifcittit to haften my depar-* 
ture ; ray heart was naturally fateful ^ 
and the obligaticms that tied me to Mift 
Gianetton were infeparable. One day^ 
after dinner, I was walking towards the 
citadel, and obferved in a coach, amongft 
other perfons, a young lady, who gaz- 
ed at me with attention, as if fhe had 
known me before : I pafled carelefly by, 
^nd her face did not feem new to me 2 
the coach on a fudden flopped, and a 
nobleman, who was in it, called to me, 
faying, Sir, this lady defires the honour 
of fpeaking to you: the honour. Sir, 
will be mine, replied I; and, going up 
to the coach, defired to know her plea-- 
fure. I am either abfolutely dreaming,' 
faid Ihe, or yon, Sir, fo nearly refem- 
ble Mifs D'Arville, known by me ia 
Bb 3 the 
( 282.) 
th* content of Avignon, that, if you 
zre not her, you are certainly her bro- 
ther. Imagine how I looked, at thefe 
words ; I know not what concealed m\r 
bluflics, but a cold horror ran through, 
every vein, which mortified my ihame 
within me, and I difcovered, that mo«* 
ment, that the lady, who fpoke to mc^ 
was Mifs Marli, educated with me in 
the convent of Avignon. I found it 
very difficult to hide my confufion, nor 
did I know how to anlwer her : how- 
ever, as I had no time to lofe in reflec- 
tions. No, Madam, I am not brother 
|o Mifs D'Arville, iaid I, nor do I 
even know her^ only by what J have 
read in the Gazettes. You will excuie 
xny curiofity. Sir, faid Ihe, as I had a 
great regard for her; and fuppoling you 
to be her brother, I was in hopes to 
bear fomething about her from you. 
If I knew any thing of her. Madam » 
replied I, with more franknefs than at 
firft, I might have gained great favour 
at Verfaillcs, by acquainting them with 
it ; for they are continually fearching 
ibr her with the greatcft diligence. It 
is furprifing, faid the lady, that they 
can hear nothing of her in fo long a 
tinae. This Mifs D'Arville, anfwered 
I, mj^tt have been a girl of fpirit, hav- 
ing 
( 2Ss ) 
ing the courage to form and execute 
fuch a fcheme. Mifs Marli detained 
me near half an hour at the door of the 
coach ; and I founds by her difcourfe, 
that ihe was married at Turin about fix 
months before, when Ihe had juft come 
out of retirement at Avignon : fhc broke 
off with affuring me, that if I would fa- 
vour her with a vifit, Ihc Ihould efteera 
it as a great pleafure. I took my leaye, 
and promifed to wait upon her; but, 
as foon as I was at liberty, refolved ne- 
ver to fee her more. When I got back 
to my lodging, I reflefted on what I 
Ihould do: if Iremain in Turin another 
moment, thought I, the curiofity of 
this woman may baffle all my fchemes : 
Madam Marli waits for my vifit, Mifs 
Gianctton defires to go with me toltaly ; 
rU put both upon a par, and' go off 
without feeing either ; the one will call 
me ungrateful, the other rude: what 
does it fignify ? every ill is lefs than 
that which would happen if I was 
known. Having fixed this refolution, 
I left Turin that evening, and took the 
toad for Lombardy^

^tfare my Arrival at Milan the Count of 
Termes is recalled 4o Paris. 
Mounted in a poft-chaife, and ac- 
compaokd only with my thoughts,* 
I plcafed myfelf with the hopes of fee- 
ing Gomnt Termes, that I might ac- 
quaint him with my fitmtion, and re- 
ceiv€ his advicf^ The nigher I drew to 
him, the more my love for him incrcaf- 
cd : never did I look fo much at his pic- 
ture as I did in that journey, though I 
always kept it about me ; I pleafcd my- 
felf with the thoughts of furprifing 
him when he leaft expcfted it, and in 
hearing the firft tranfports of his ten- 
dernefs. In lefs than two days I arriv- 
ed at Milan, but fo tired with my jour- 
ney that I was obliged to retire to my 
bed, and my ficknefs, accompanied 
with a flight fever, gave me fome un- 
eafinefs, being in an inn, and in a city 
where I knew nobody. T was then forry 
that I did not take Mifs Gianetton's 
council, whofe company would have 
been very neceffary to me. After two 
days repofe my iicknefs vanifhed ; and 
as I had been informed, the firft day I 
came .4nto town, that the Marlhall 
of 
( i?5 ) 
nf #    ^j^5 in Milan, where he in-* 
tended to eftablilh his winter-quarters* 
1 prepared myfclf to prefent to him the 
letters given me by the Prince, in whiclt 
I was recommended. I provided a rich 
fuit of cloaths in the military fafliion, 
adapted to the profeflion I was going ta 
embrace ; and lummonfed, to my affif* 
tance, all my refolution, to merit there 
a gracious reception. 
I had fcarcc entered the anti-cham- 
ber of the Marfliall, which was full of 
young officers, who, knowing I was of 
France, took particular notice of me : 
they aiked me, courtcoufly, what was 
tny bufinefs there ? when telling them 
that I came from Verfailles, and had let* 
tcrs from the Prince of *  * * to the 
Marfhall, they introduced me to his 
prefence. 
. As foon as he faw me, You are, I 
fuppofe Sir, faid he, with a lively and 
free air, Count Richard, who was 
Gentleman to theDuchefs of * *  *, my 
particular friend ; I have been feme 
weeks expeAing you, and was afraid 
you had miftaken the road ; but I am 
now of a different opinion, and am ra- 
ther induced to believe fome love ad* 
venture has detained you by the way. 
I replied, that I fuppofed he had been 
informed 
( 286 ) 
Informed of what had happened to the 
Prhice and me, at Paris j giving him> 
at the fame time, an account of my 
misfortune at Turin. I then prefented 
him with the letters, full of generous 
cxpreffions concerning me ; but he faid 
they were needlefs, becaufe he had 
..ir others; upon the fame account, and that 
he had a commiffion at my fervice : you 
are then, faid he, a Captain in the Bur- 
gundy regiment, which is quartered at 
Pa via, but you may remain with me, 
if you have a mind fo to do, in Milan ; 
in the mean time, you'll ftay and dine 
with me to day, that I may meafurc 
your bravery by your appetite. He 
then gave me my commiffion, and I 
received the compliments of the gentle-* 
men in the anti-chamber. I wilhed for 
an opportunity to be alone, to ccfle<a: 
properly on my new fituation : I am 
now going to appear on the great ftagfc 
of the world, in the chara^r of a fol^ 
dier; what could be more ridiculous 
and extravagant in a girl like me ? if 1 
had courage neceffary for a foldier, I 
had neither the experience, art, or con^ 
du<5t, which alone, amongft fo many 
dangers, could be a means of preferv- 
ing my life : the idea of death did not 
terrify me, having defired it often, as 
an 
( 2^7 ) 
an alleviation to my greateft afflicfUons ; 
yet love of life is natural to us all, and^ 
in my prcfent circumftances, it appear- 
ed more defirable than ufaal to me. 
Miferable me ! faid I, in my heart, if, 
in a-trench, or under a breach, I fhould 
remain mortally wounded: the fecrct of 
my fex would be difcovered to the 
whole array ; and what would become 
of my reputation and honour? how 
many would attribute this my meta- 
mcMrphofis, to an unbridled luft ! how 
many would deny me the glory of thofe 
virtuous principles, with which God 
was fo good as to endow me, and 
which I Ihallever ftudy to maintain! 
This thought tormented me much j 
and when I reflefted, that my love for 
Count Termes had reduced me to this 
extremity, I almoft repented of lo^^ing 
him ; knowing, that he was the caufe 
of every misfortune which had hap- 
pened to me hitherto, and which might 
happen to me hereafter, I had a great 
defire to fee him ; and my being order- 
ed by the Marlhall to remain in Milan, 
though my regimem was in Pavla, gave 
me incredible ui-ieafinefs : to evade 
which, my love foon found a remedy^ 
and a paffion, likie mine, foan finds a 
thQufandxeafonable pretences j the ne- 
ceffity 
( t9S ) 
ccflity of making myfelf knowft to my 
regiment, was an excellent excuft for 
nic to get leave to g^o a few days to Pa- 
via : I went fooi> after to the Marlhall, 
to get permiffion for a few days to vilit 
my regiment in Pavia ; I found him 
writing j and on feeing me. Come here, 
fays he, I am juft writing to the 
Duchefs concerning yourfelf : I anfwer- 
cd, that my perfon did not merit his 
taking fo much trouble about me ; at 
the fame time I begged he would fend 
her my humble refpefts. I Ihall do it, 
replied he, with pleafure ; Ihe has alfo 
defired me to fend Count Termes im- 
mediately to Verfailles, and, fuppofing 
you to have been here fome time, has 
recommended your perfon : I- have 
obeyed her, even before! anfwered her 
letter ; and Count Termes will be at 
Verfailles to-morrow, for he left Pavia 
the fame day you came to Milan ; and, 
with the extraordinary poft of this 
night, I ihall acquaint her with what I 
have done for you, in confequence of her 
recommendation. Thefe words pierc* 
ed like fo many thunderbolts to my 
poor heart ; I knew not for what I 
came, nor did I know how to go away ^ 
I took my leave in the beft manner I 
c^uld, andj returning to my habita-- 
tion^ 
( 289 ) 
tlon, burft out immediately into a flood 
of tears; Juft heaven! faid I, what 
ftate more painful, what deftiny more 
obftinate than mine, in purfuing me in 
this manner? I came purpofely from Pa- 
ris to Italy, to face death in the field of 
battle, in hopes of beholding Count 
Termes : and he, by the fatality of def- 
tiny, has been obliged to leare Pavia 
the very day I came to Milan : could 
any thing happen more, unlucky than 
this, to make me miferable and unhap* 
py ! If the confufion of my mind had 
not blinded reafonable refiedlion, how 
foon might I have penetrated into the 
motives of the whole proceeding : in z 
few moments after, the words of Ma- 
dam Cafardo's letter ftruck in my 
mind, in which flie mentioned, that 
the Duchefs refolutely defigned to part 
with the Duke^ and had others by 
whom ihe might bring it about, with- 
out my afliftance ; and this muft be her 
fcheme, to obtain fome account of the 
fugitive of Avignon: for this purpofe 
ihe has fent for the Count ; and, from 
what (he has heard concerning our cor- 
refpondence at Avignon, fuppofes him to 
he an accomplice in my flight : heavens! 
why did ihe not t^ink of this remedy 
before ? why did Ihe not fend for him 
Vol, I. Co to 
( 29<^ ) 
to Verfailles, while I was there, that the 
niyftery of my parentage might have 
been unravelled oix the fpot ? to what 
end fliould I tarry in Italy, deprived of 
the objaft which attra<fted me ! and how 
can I leave it, without rendering my- 
fclf contemptible to the Marlhall, and 
to the Prince, my protestor, who re- 
commended me ? Oh God! how great 
was my agony ; I was bound to accept 
a company in the army, to facrifiee 
my liberty, to hazard my life, and ei>- 
danger my honour; and all this for 
what ? Ah me ! to that I was a 
ftranger; and not to know the future 
confequenccs of it, was to me a double 
torment : my bark, however, was 
launched out into the open fea, and be 
the wind profperous or, foul, I muft 
navigate the vefTel in the beft manner I 
could, and wait the events erf* time. I 
fbon experienced that the diflblute and 
debauched way of life, common 
amongft the young officers, would by "^ 
no means fuit with my inclination or ! 
conftitution ; and therefore I refolved 
to ask permiffion of the Marfliall to 
yifit my regiment in Pavia, in order to 
avoid the obligation I was under of 
keeping them company. This the 
. Marlhall 
\ 
1 
( 291 ) 
Marihall readily granted me, with leave 
to go and return to Milan whenever I 
thought proper ; at the fame time giv- 
ing me a letter to the Brigadier who 
commanded there, that I might be 
treated with the utmoft civility, I then 
proceeded on my journey to Pavia, and, 
as foon as I arrived, prefented the Bri- 
gadier with the letters from the Mar- 
IhalL I found a very obliging recep-; 
tion, and my quarters were appointed 
for me at the houfe of the Countefs of 
* * *, to whom I was coridu<5tcd, the 
fame evening, by one of the adjutants. 
This Countefs was a widow lady of 
about twenty-two years of age, not ve- 
ry rich, but full of fpirit and tolerably 
handfome : (he had not, 'tis true, that 
vivacity and penetration which is fo 
common and confpicuous in the French 
ladies, but I found that the want of it 
was rather owing^to her education than 
to any deficiency of her natural ta- 
lents. When I entered her houfe flie 
received me in a genteel manner, and 
affigned me a very handfome apart-^ 
ment, telling me at the fame time, ihe 
wa? forry it was not in her power to 
accommodate me better : I replied that 
it was equal to my beft wiflies, and that 
her amiable company would make it 
C c 2 a^ree* 
( 292 ) 
agreeable was it ever fo bad, I began 
to be very happy in my new quarters, 
paffing whole days in reading and wri- 
ting; this the dountcfs attributed to 
melancholy, artd rallied me often upon 
the little inclination I had for the com- 
pany of the ladies ; and I, in return, 
being defirous to get rid of her impor- 
tunities, told her, that I faw nothing in 
theltalian ladies, fufficient to engage my 
attention j I ihould not, I confefs, have 
anfwered her thus, had I not found her 
really troublefome to me.

Motives 0/ Jeakufy^ which help to tor* 
ment me. 
ON E morning the Countefs defired 
my company to take a difli of 
chocolate with her ; I entered her 
room while fhe was dreffing at her toi- 
let, and thinking that Ihe would never 
have done, I liked my own condition 
the better for not fubje6ting me to that 
torture; but after waiting fome time, 
I could not help jokeing^ as ufual, on 
hcF weaknefs ; See, Madam, faid I, a 
French woman in this time would have 
been dreft fix times. You may talk as 
you plcafe, replied Ihe, about the 
French 
( 293 y 
French' ladies, but they are alfo wo- 
men; and to drefs themfelves proper- 
ly, muft have their proper time. The 
women of fpirit, replied I, lament that 
time as loft, though in others it ferves 
to foment their vanity ; the French la- 
dies are alfo at their toilet every day, 
but then they fpend a very little time at 
it, or elfe fomething extraordinary oc-. 
cafions them to flay longer -, yet then 
they do not lofe their time, but 
read fome good book, and while the 
waituig-maid is dreffing their hair^ 
they are adorning their minds by read- 
ing. I, anfwered the Count els, with 
difdain, can do but Qne thing at a ti«ae. 
True, Madam, replied I, but that 
which your maid does, is not done by. 
you; your whole bufij3[efs,i at that 
time, is to pleafc yourifelf^ by .looking 
at your own pi6turc in the glafsi, wheai 
you might be much better employed iw 
the perufal of a good book, to the. 
great improvement of your natural ta-* 
lents. So much reading I don't ap- 
prove of, replied Ihe-, and muft fay,, 
that it is not agreeable to myfex. This^. 
faid I, is a very great fault in the edu- 
cation of you Italian women; your 
childhood they place under the direc- 
Cc 3 tion 
( 294 ) 
tion of fome ignorant bigot, who filb 
your mind with nothing clfe but To- 
ries of enchantments, witches, and 
ghofts; and when he returns you to 
your mother, you fcarce know even 
the alphabet : when you are at the age 
of nine or ten, with thefe prejudices in 
your mind, you are put into a cloifter, 
to receive fuch further improvements 
in yoiu: education as are judged necef- 
fery to qualify a fine lady ; and when 
you leave the cloifter, ypn come tunx- 
bling into the world without knowing 
what it is, and begin to converfe with 
men, without having one qualification 
aeceiTary to maintain a converfation 
that would not be difagrecabte to others, 
and mcMre fo to yourfelf : all this is ow« 
ing to an ill-judged education ; ii> 
France, the wonien read more than 
the men ; by which they gain the re- 
putaticMi of being women of underftand- 
ing and fpirit. WeH, replied the Coun- 
ted, you may cenfure asyou pleafe the 
haijian ladies, neverthelefs we women 
muft a6l as women, and not as poets and 
authors, and, without thefe ornaments, 
there are people that will excufe us r 
this plainly Ihews that you are too nice 
with our fex ; I knew and have con- 
verfed with -other French gentlemen^- 
who 
( 295 ) 
who have done more juftice to the Ita- 
lian ladies. They might have done it, 
anfwered I, as lovers, to delude you ; 
and not to talk, as I do, like a friend. 
I don't know, faid the Countefs, but I 
can Ihew you a letter, which I received 
from Paris yefterday morning ; read it, 
and you will know how he that wrote 
it fpeaks of the Italian women : fd fay- 
ing, flie pulled it out of her pocket and 
tc^ed it on the toilet, that I might read 
it, Thecuriofity of other people's af- 
fairs was never my weaknefs, though it 
always was of fervice to me ; I had no 
defire to fee the contents, but as Ihe 
tofled it upon the toilet, half open, it 
ifeemed to be wrote in a charaAer which 
I thought was not new to me ; I took it 
with a fmile, but, when I read it. Oh 
God ! what a fudden tumult rofe in my 
foul, on feeing it was wrote by Count 
Termes, and contained as follows : 
' Madam, 
I inuft fay, that the Italian ladles, in 
point of conftancy, are preferable to 
all other women ; two letters of yours 
I have received fince I came to Paris, 
and both confirm me in the high opi- 
nion I have for your perfon : every 
one, who is not infenfible, cannot but 
adore 
, ( 2^96 ) 
adore you though ever fo far from you : 
I cannot aflure you when I Ihall be for 
going to Italy, as my ilay at this place 
depends entirely upon the Duchefs of 
♦ ♦ * *, who has called me here upon 
her own particular affairs : I can fafely 
promife you, that, though afar off, I 
ihall ever be, with the utmoft refpedt 
to you. Madam, 
Termes.** 
What myflery did this letter unravel 
to me, and how many furious and dif- 
turbed ideas came at once into my mind I 
Count Tcrmes was, in my eyes, an un- 
grateful and perfidious wretch j how- 
much, thought I, have I fuiFered ifor 
him ? I went ftrolling about the world,, 
in difguife, in continual danger of my 
reputation, liberty, and life; without 
home, without refuge, without friends, 
and without parents ; and he, in the 
mean time, has given his heart to an- 
other woman : 'tis plain he has been ' 
very intimate with her at Pavia, for he 
is in hafte to leave Paris to return back 
to her : in her I fee, before my eyes, 
my rival, which alone is fufficient to 
make me wilh for her death ; yet I am 
bound to live under one roof, and, eat 
at one table with her, and to behave. 
with 
( 297 ) 
with the civility due from a flringcr to 
a miftrefs of the houfe : if at firft I 
thought that the Countefs merited all 
my gratitude, I now thought fhe merit- 
ed my hatred and difdain : female va- 
nity had never any great power of my 
mind, becaufe I was accuftomed to a6t 
the mto, and almoft forget that I was a 
woman ; but, on this occafion, it vi- 
goroufly exerted itfelf, and I was fully 
convinced that the charms of the Coun- 
tefs were not to comjpare with mine, 
and that Count Termes did me great 
injuftice. All thefe thoughts pafled in 
my mind while I was reading the letter, 
and my greateft difficulty was how to 
fupprefs my agitation, that I might 
learn fomething more from the Coun- 
tefs. In returning her the letter, I afked 
her, Coolly, how Ihe became acquaint- 
ed with Count Termes ? That amiable 
Chevalier, faid fhe, lodged in my houfe 
all laft winter, and two months of this, 
which feemed to be only two days; 
every time I go into your room, or 
fit down with you, he comes into 
my mind; I took a pleafure in his com- 
pany, becaufe he liked converfation, 
and had a better opinion of the Italian 
women than you feem to have: fhe 
a/ked me, if Count Termes was my ac- 
quaintance? 
I 
( 29» > 
qtlaintance ? and, upon my aiifVerlng 
in the affirmative, ihe was open enough 
to tell me, that if he had not been call- 
ed to Paris, he would certainly have 
married her that winter. Every word 
Ihe fpoke concerning him, was a wound 
to my poor heart, which had fuffered 
all affli6tions except that of jealoufy, 
and which I found to be the greateft 
and iharpeft of them all; had the 
Countefs known what trouble her 
words gave me, Ihe would never have 
fpoken of him more; but ihe made 
me her confidant in all her tendernefs, 
and took occafion, on every trifling ac-» 
cident, to reafon with mc about him,, 
as if Ihe did it on purpofc to anger me : 
the city, and even the houfe, in which 
I expefted to be at eafe, was now an 
objeft of trouble to me ; the very bed I 
lay upon at night, when I reflc<5led that 
it was the fame on which that ingrateftil 
wretch had flept, became odious to me;, 
and every word of the Countefs, even- 
the moft indifferent, revived my jealous 
fufpicions.

My feigned Amcur with theCountefs^ and 
Confequences attending it. 
FROM morning till night inter- 
nally troubled with thefe thoughts, 
I could no longer enjoy any quiet in a 
city, or houfe, that at firft I took de- 
light in ; the name only of Count Ter- 
mes, would formerly have made my 
heart leap with joy, but now his name, 
and the houfe he lodged in, was to me 
a continual torment : to leave at once 
both that place and my rival, I thought 
would make me fcfs unhappy; but with 
what pretence could I leave thofe quar- 
ters, without leaving Pavia ? and how 
could I leave Pavia, when I had obtain- 
ed permiffion from the Marlhall to ftay 
there fome time ? After many reflexi- 
ons, I refolvcd to be ruled in all by 
reafon, and, in preference to every 
other confideration, to follow the fteps 
of virtue: it is enough, faid I, to my- 
felf, that the Count is guilty ; a man is 
never wanting in excuies, and to a lo- 
ver there is nothing more eafythan to 
regain the heart with a little flattery ; 
I muft convince him of his crime in a 
manlier that he cannot deny it, and, 
when 
( 3^0 ) 
when I have convinced him, I will leave 
loving of hmi, and his crime alone 
will ferve to puniih him. To compals 
this defign, I muft remain in the fame 
houfe with the Countefs, and dexte- 
roufly get out of her hands one of the 
Comit's letters, that I might fend it to 
him inclofed in one of mine, and with 
it make him blufh. The undertaking 
was very difficult, becaufe as much as 
the Countefs was foolifh and impru- 
dent, (he would not have failed in this 
firft of her amours, unlefs one could 
make her fall by fome cheat ; the weak- 
eft part in a woman of her chamifter, 
thought I, is vanity ; therefore I re- 
folved to attack her on this lide, and by . 
that means obtain my defire ; thus I was 
to reprefent a lover, a fcene fo contra- 
ry to that which pafled in my heart ; 
fhe with every word, I may fay, gave 
me my death; and I, with every word, 
ftudied to excite in her breaft a new 
tendernefs; at the firft aflault the 
Countefs was a little furprifed, but de- 
clared fome aifedtion for me, and the 
next time confirmed it with words, pro- 
teftations, and oaths of fidelity, fo that 
I might repute inyfelf the happieft 
lover upon earth ; the Count was no 
more fpoke of but as ingrateful and 
uncou- 
( ioi ) 
raiconftant, though ihe before expirefl^ 
^d to me the praifes (he received froiri 
him ; they were now reprefentedl M z

haps may be true^ aAd not what ^flie 
feid before; but in either caft flic 
might be eqfually a Han 
My love with the Gounttfs rttade 
great prog*eft ; I do not preftmc to fay 
flie really loved me, becatufe real lore 
cannot be where there is fo much in- 
conftancy ; but there was every fign of 
a fincere tdttdernefs, and one time in 
particular It was very near proving £i- 
tal to my fcheme. Whoever of vls wai 
up the fooneft went into the othcrV 
apartment to drink chocolate, arid !■ 
ufed to wait upon her ; but one morn- 
ing to my misfortune, I was prevented 
by her coming into my room before I 
was hardly awake, with all that famili- 
arity which, ti3 a widow, hofpitality, 
friendfliip, and love permits; (he lit 
down on the fide of the bed, and pre- 
fcnted to nle the chocolate; I would 
have fooner beeii at the head of a pic- 
quet in the field, expofed to an htm- 
dred archers, than in that bed at the 
face of one woman only, who might 
very eafily have found what fort of an 
officer I was : I was ttfed to flcep al- 
Vol* ! Dd way 
C 30* ) 
vays With a linen bed-gown tight round 
my body ; had I only put one of my 
amis from under the cloaths,. it would 
have been fufficient . to let the Countefs 
fee what I was ; nor was there any me- 
thod to rid rayfelf of my fears, but by 
imiling, and faying. Dear Countels, 
fince you have faved me the trouble of 
going to your room, fave me that of 
putting my hands into the cold, and 
gVe me the chocolate yourfelf. The 
:>untefs, without the leaft fufpicion, 
laughed and took pieafure in holding it 
to my mouth, and I, glad not to trou- 
ble her long, drank it off in two fips ; 
when ihe had drank her own, fhxt went 
away hughmg, and left me 2^ liberty 
to drefs myfeif ; and I fwore in my 
heart never to let her catch me in bed 
anymore* 
But my principal view waff to ^et 
fome letter of the Count's o\it of ? her 
hands, and by appearmg jealbus t al* 
moft reduced her to the point of giv- 
ing them to me to burn. One mj^rn- 
ing, while ihe was looking in her trunk 
for them, a footman brought me word 
that there was fomebody defired to fee 
me; let them corn^ in, replied the 
Countefi, let who will want him they 
arc welcomes but how was I furprifed 
at 
< 3<^3 ) 
It feeing a girl iii a travclKng drcfs?, 
who, not obferving the CounteS) fitvt 
to me, and, throwing her arms round 
my neck, had aknoft killed me. No 
one will wonder at this liberty whetii 
they know that this traveller was Mifs 
Gianetton, who, going to fing at Mi- 
Ian, came exprefly t6 Pavia to have the 
pleafure of feeing me $ her vifit would 
have been welcome, if in that encoui> 
ter Ihe had behaved a little more diC- 
creet. At fight of her I remained 
ftunn'd, nor was the Counteft Icfs fur- 
prifed than me; but jealoufy poflcifcd 
her that moment, and fpitefully ihutting 
the trunk, in which ihe was looking 
for the Count's letters, ihe gave me a 
frown which fpoke a hundred things at 
once, and went out of the room without 
faluting the ilrangcrj Mifs Gianetton 
could not be but furfJrifed at this acci- 
dent, and asked me the reafon ? I made 
fome excufe, and could foon havc^ got 
rid of her company, but conficlering 
the obligations I lay under to her, 1 
could not do it without Ihewing myfelf 
ungrateful : I was obliged to hear from 
her all the lamentable accidents of her 
journey, and how ill (he was ufed by 
the governors of the theatre, andf, 
in ihort, all that had happened fince

fromjiccompanying her to her lodgings 
nakiog a hundred excufes, and pror 
tnifing that before dark I would pay 
her a vifit. As foon as ihe was gone I 
thopght of rirconcUing myfelf with the 
Countefs, but ihe would not hear me j 
Go to your Singer, were the only words 
I could get from her, tho' I told her 
w^o Mifs Gianctton was, and the obli- 
gations I owed to her; in ihort. Mar 
dam, faid I, let me tdl you, that you 
Italian women are very unreafonable in 
your paiEons; I do not mind your 
amours with Coimt Termes, becaufe 
you knew him before you did me ; znd 
you make a crime of my lore witk 
Mifs Gianetton, though I knew her 
before I did you; if Count Termc« 
came lota your room fuddeniy, and 
did not fee me prefent, he would have 
a^ed in the fame manner with you ; 
neither would ypu in that cafe have 
made any rcfiftance. Even with thefe 
invincible reafons, nothing elfe would 
ihe anfwer but, Go to your Singer ; on 
this I grew a little hot, ib fcornfully 
ikying. Then 1 will go, I immediately 
left her^

would have it, the Countefs was juft 
gone out; I packed up a few neceflaries 
in a portmanteau, got into a poft- 
chaife, and left word by one of the fer-. 
vants that I was gone to Piacenza, 
where I Ihouid ftay three weeks before

been but three days at Piacenza wheu I 
received a large packet, and in^clolcd 
Count Termes* letters^, accompanied 
with on^ from the. Countefs, which I al- 
ways have preferved, and which \\cas a^ 
follow: 
« Dear Sir, 
I facrifice to you ^ven the letters of 
Count Termes, that I might be^ble to-

ypu.lhall be obeyed. I do not expert 
to fee you more, becaufe you will n^

Your Servant.** 
Thus did I obtain my end in the: 
mpft unexpciJied manner, and got pof- 
Icffion of the letters wrote to my rivals 
( 3^7 y 
yet, on reading them, I co\ild not find 
one word inconfiftent with the ftrifteft 
honour ; but his writing them to her I 
thought a crime unpardonable. I de- 
termined immediately to write to Paris, 
aiidj by incloik^ in the fame pacquct 
thofe which joccafioncd my rcfentmcnt, 
to convift him by his own Sand writing; 
though at the fame time I had fomc 
fcrujplfls in my mmd^ whether my treat-^ 
ing, in this raianner, a lady who con-* 
fided in me, would be agreeable to the 
ftrift rules of honour and juftice : fi- 
nally, I concluded that the Counlefe 
had dpne wrpng to facrifke thofe let- 
ters to the jealopfy of a third perfon^ 
and I fhould a^ rightly in preferving 
Count Termes froip the danger of fee- 
ing his honour entruftcd to the weaknefe 
of other pjsppl^ ; I therefore proceeded 
to write my letter, which was. of this 
tenor : 
« Dear Sir, 
This is the laft time you will fee any 
Jetttr of mine, or hear further of my 
perfon; in the annexed you will fee 
who Is to be blamed : having done fa 
much to prove my love to you, I can 
alfo cndcavourto forget you. Adieu. 
D'Arville/' 
( 30^ ) 
The pacquct being fealcd and cKreft- 
ed, I fent it away, but knew not how 
to demean rayfelf with the Counteft ; 
having obtained my wifli, I might in- 
deed return to Pavbi ; but how could I 
diflemble the part of a lover to one who 
was my rival, and, at the fame time, 
the fole occaiion of my breach with 
Count Termes ? with the letters of the 
Count, I alfo fent the one the Countefs 
wrote to me, that he might have ocular 
demonfiration that he had facrificed a 
faithful lover to an inconflant woman j 
and all thefe letters might have produc- 
ed dangerous effe<fts to me, if Count 
Termes had been fo imprudent as to 
ijpbtaid the Countefs. Notwithftand- 
ing this, I was obliged to return to Pa- 
via, in hopes that, before anfwers came 
from Paris, fome accident would hap- 
pen that would deliver me from the 
importunities of the Countefs, and, if 
it came to the worft, I could contrive 
fome way to be called back to Milan. 
After an abfence of fix days I arrived 
there, and the Countefs received me as 
if no mifunderftanding had happened 
between us ; and if I could have erafed 
from my mind her former connections 
with Count Termes, I might have paff- 
ed my lime with her in a comfortable 
and 
( 309 ) 
tnd agreeable manner: but ks the 
thoughts of his iiiconflancy were ever 
uppcrnioft in my mind, I refolded to 
kave Pavia the firft opportunity, and 
accordingly wrote to the Marfliall, in- 
forming him that I was deiirous of be- 
ing recalled, and tired of remaining 
there utterly inadive, and ufelefs to my 
King and country : this letter to the 
Marlhall did me great honour, and he 
immediately fent orders for me to re- 
pair to Milan. After continuing there 
fome days, we had notice to march to 
Piacenza. We paiTed that winter and 
the next fpring in continual marches, 
that we might kepp continual obferva- 
tionof the enemy. In the fummer we 
incamped near Sacca, and extended 
into Parma, where there was a guard 
of fix battallions. l»Jothing happened 
there worth mentioning; I received in- 
deed fome letters from Mifs.Gianetton 
and the Countefs, which I anfwered ac- 
cording to my cuftom by another hand; 
but they foon left off importuning me, 
I fuppofe they found better ways to 
imploy their time. Of Count Termes 
I had no news, nor could I have it, 
becaufe he did not know where I was, 
nor under what name to direft his let- 
ters to me^ he now and then came into 
my 
my mind, but the memory of him dicf 
not trouble me much, becaufe my 
thoughts were employed on the dan- 
gers of my life, which was expofed 
every moment in the heart of an army 
who fought every occafion to come id 
battle with the enemy, and not a day 
pafied without fome fkirmilhes: it was 
not the love of my life that kejpt me in 
continual apprehenfion, fa much as the 
fear of being difcovered to be a wo- 
man, if I fliould, by fome unlucky 
blow, be ftruck dead, and leave my 
honour expofed to. the flander of the 
malicious 5 but the Marlhall favoured 
me in all cncounten, and I attributed 
it to the recommendation of the Prince, 
who often dcfired news of my perfon; 
his precauticMK neverthclefs were not 
infallible, and my unlucky deftiny fol- 
lowed me wherever I went.

IN the heat of the fummer we had 
notice one night, in the camp, that 
the army of the Auftrians decamped 
iuddenly^ and was marching towafds 
Tarma, in order to poflefs the road 
that leads to Piacenza : we immediately 
decamped and marched all that night, 
and two hours after fun-rife we were 
under the walls of Parma, entering on 
the road that led to the enemy; my 
battallion was, in the march, the fe- 
cond of die van-guard j we were* hard- 
ly got. forward half a mile before we 
fbvmd ourfelves in the enemy's fire ; 
the Auftrians were in battle array in 
the field upon our left, which was co- 
vered with trees, and, being in the 
middle of fummer, were full of leaves 
and. boughs, which hadhinderedus from 
feeing them j a Ihower of Ihot was dif- 
charged at us from the bulhcs. The

THIS affair made a great noife, 
and every one might fee what 
wind brought that tempeft„upon Tar~ 
tar ; they could not but fay I was in 
the right, or at leaft excufe me ; but 
fey what they pleafed, I left that place 
a few days after, and weitt to Venice^ 
Of this place I had read and heard, 
great wonders, and, irx truth, it fully ^ 
anfwered my expe<aations. The car- 
nival ^mc being juft begun, 1 mighty .

tice has overtaken you, and you wiil 
have an opportunity in this place to re^

evident I was taken for a woman; and I 
made not the leaft doubt, but that the 
Duke had by fomc means got intcUi- 
geiiceof me, and in confcqacncc had 
caufed me to be arretted. I pailed that 
night on the bare boards, and. Oh, 
God ! what was then my agony, and my 
moft fcrious reflexions ! in the Baftile, 
J w^ in the handjt of people that knew 
fomething c£ my honcft character, and 
therefortt f might expcft frou friends

could I tell what fufpic ion they lud con- 
ccived againft me, when they ufed me 
thus without knowing me ; the leaft I 
had to fear was a long imprifonmenf, 
and the fear of being difcorcred to be a 
woman troubled me' more than the 
thoughts of death itfelf : at laft day- 
light appeared, and the door of my dun- 
geon being opened, there entered a man 
whom at the firft fight I took to be my 
execu- 
cxecutionerr; he advanced, faying to
