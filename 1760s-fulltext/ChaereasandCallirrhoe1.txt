PREFACE 
BY THE 
EDITOR. 
THE loves of Charcas and Collir- 
rhoe, by Chariton of Aphroditios, 
being one of the few Greelc romances 
I which have efcaped the injuries of time; 
are thought to be no inconfiderable ac- 
quifition to the republic of letters. 
The original Greek manufcript, fup- 
pofed to be tranlcribed in the thirteenth 
century, was found in the celebrated 
abbey at Florence; intermixed with 
twenty-two other jweces by various 
1 authors -, 
PREFACE. 
authors i among which are AchiHes 
Tatius, Longus, Xenophon Ephcfius, 
and ^fop's Fables. The fubjcas of the 
other trcatifes relate to the chriftian re- 
ligion, or to the Byzantine hiftorians. 
It was imagined, that another manu- 
fcript of CKariton was lodged in the 
Vatican Library j but, after the moft 
ftriil fearch, no fuch copy could be 
found. Many perfons of great erudi- 
tion, particularly Father Montfaijcon, 
and Mr. Burmann, were vaftly deflrous 
of feeing this work in print -, and ufed 
their utmoft endeavours to promote an 
edition of it, but without fuccefs. ' 
' But about forty years fince, Salvini 
and Cocchi, whole literary produftions

nufcript of Chariton, with an intent' to 
pubiifli it : a merit, however, that wa* 
referved for the very learned Mr. D'Or- 
ville of Amfleidam. 
For that gentleman, after having 
vifited England and France, travelled 
into Italy -, and getting acquainted in 
FIoi ence, with the above- mentioned 
Dr. Cocchi ; this latter, with the hu- 
manity and politenefs whith throw a

tlie Romans, was honourable in fome

wrote many orations, and went on feveral 
embaflies from Herod, was called Ama-

paflages in his book, that he had feen 
the facred writings. We mutt not in- 
fer that he was a heathen, bccaufe he 
makes great ufe of the pagan mythology,

^im to have frequent rccourle to it. 
' With rcfpea to the work, the inci- 
dents in it are fuppofcd to have hap- 
pened about four hundred years before 
ihe birth of Chrift. The diftion of 
Chariton is Angular, and lefs pure thaiL

mediktely guefled the whole a&alr. But he 
was doubifiil, at iirft, whether It would not

what we have done, to come off with impu- 
nity. I therefore think that it will be bed 
for ns to leave erery article, in the Maufo- 
Iseum, as we found it ; and TeClorc Calllrrhoe 
to her hnfband, and to her father. We then 
may declare that,, pq^rfuaot to the cufbm of 
fiDtermeD, we ran our veflel afhore oear to

humanity prompted us to break open thj

Tberon objcfled to this ; the Athenians being 
naturally too curious and inquifitire for bis

They are a chattering people, and fond of 
wrangling. Their ports arc crouded with 
Jharpers and informers. Tbefe will not fail

examined by the Areopagus, and by ths

ed than the Athenians. Ionia is the country 
to anfwer our purpofc; many of its inhabi- 
tants being as wealthy as princes, by the riches 
they draw from upper Afia. The lonians are 
a very lu&arione and indolent people, who 
hate law-fuiti ; and I hope to meet with fome 
of my acquaintance among them. Having 
then taken in water, and got provifions out 
of certain trading Tcflels lying in the har-

tias did, was to defire Theroo to wait for 
him, till he fliould have tranfa£lcd fome bit- 
Jine& ^th his Lord. He afterwards conduc- 
ed him to his own apartmettts, which feemed 
every way fit for a geiitlemin. He then gave 
orders for the table to befpread; when The-, 
roa, being an artful man who cotild futt 
himlelf to all times and drcumllances, eat 
and drank very freely with Leonas, to pre- 
vent bis being fufpe£i:cd ; and Aiil more, to 
(bow how proud he fhould be of his friend' 
ftiip. While they were thtis it dinner, they 
had a long conference concerning the wo- 
man. Theroh made greater encomiums on 
the beauties of her mind, than on thofc of 
hec perfon ; well knowing, that what is not 
(een jequires pralfe ; but that what we do 
fee, reconuneods icfdf. — — ^ome, (faid Leo-

yon may recover yourfelf, from the &tiga»

ly rejoiced at this, he imaginiDg, that he 
ihould more eafily difpofe of his prize in a 
folitude, than la a public market.-^ — —We

pafltng along the fea-coafl in a Anal] TejQel, 
arrived at the Villa ; he having brooght «dth 
him the money, in order to be ready for 
the merchant. During this interval, Theron 
came unawares opoa his companions, who 
vcre on the ftraDd, and very impatient to fee 
Um i when telling them his fnccels, he em* 
braced Callirrhoe, and fpake thus : ^I in- 
tended (my child !) to hare reftored yon tm«

you think fit, of your clothes and other 
thmgs i and we will keep the reft for yon.— 
Callirrhoc now finlied within herfelf, thongb 
her heart was oppreflcd with fcrrow. She 
looked npon Theron as very filly, in }magitt- 
Ing that flie could b^eve him ; well know- 
ing that She was fold. Nevcrthelefs flic was fo 
extremely defiroas of being freed from the py-

Do yoa therefore prcfcrvc them carefally for

was burled with me. She then drew the 
veil over her fece, faying : Theron I carry 
jnc whithcrfo^ver you pleafe ; for any place 
would be preferable to the fepulchre, or to 
the fcg. 
XIV, As foon as Theron was got near to 
the Villa, he made ufe of the following arti- 
fice. Uaveiling CallJrrhoe, and untying her 
hair, fo that it flowed negligCDtly over her 
flioulders ; he then opened the door, and or- 
dered her to enter firfl. Leonas, anjj thofe 
in the room with him, feeing fo exquilite a

At this declaration the beholders were Amck

put to bed, ia a moft fplendid room, they 
left her ; grief, fatigue, and fear, calliDg for

variety of woe, that he could feldom be pre- 
vailed upon to go abroad, though his coun- 
try flood in great need of his alSnaiicc. On 
the contrary, he confined himfelf to thv npp- 
ttal chamber, as if his wife had been there. 
The moment he faw Leonas, he cried :

enjoyed, fincc the deaih of my dear, fiaplcfs

more beautiful, more charming than ever; 
and Ihc cohabited with me, as when awake.

Dionyfius linened, with great pleafure, to 
the iDchantiog pi£lare which Leonas drew 
of this woman j he being a lover of the lair-

overjoyed that Dionyflus did not believe (he 
account he gave of Calllrrhoe ; lie imagining*

fiU3 then ordered his fleward to enquire, if 
there were any Sybarites in the city ; bidding 
him leave, ia the mean time, the woman at

While (he uttered thefc wordst her voice

was remarkably melodious, and fweet as the 
accents of the lyre. Being iiow confufedi 
. and aibamsd to convcrfe any longer with the 
woman, DionyJlus, already inflamed by love, 
went to the Villa. His great croud of atten-

kings, as in a bee-hlvc; for all followed Cal-

to her former refidencc.

ftriftly to the dilates ^f the pnieft virtue ;

- all <hat night ; hoping, by this means, to 
conceal his paflion, which yet bis filence 
(though unperccived by faunfetf) betrayed. 
Taking then part of the fupper : ^I«t this 
[cried he) be carried to oar {Iranger. How- 
ever, do not fay that it comes from her mader, 
but from Dionylius. — ^^He continued caiouz- 
iog longer than ufual, knowing that it would 
be inipoflible for him to Qeep ; and therefore 
wiflied to fpcnd the night with his friends. 
Nevcrthelefs, when it was- far advanced, he 
broke up from the company, and went to 
bed ; but found fleep a {trai^ger to his ^es. 
Fancy then carried him into the temj^e of Ve-

cumflance relative to CalHrrboe ; her face* 
her floviog treflisi, ber air, her voice, her 
glance, her drcisa her difcourfc ; bat what 
inflaated him, was her tears. Tbea might be 
feea tlie cooffiA betwixt love and reafoD ; for 
though Dionylins was deeply finittea, he yet 
had too much wifdom aod Rrengih of mind 
not to oppofe his palEon ; and thereapon, like 
one who lifts his head above the waves, he 
cried : — O Dionyfius ! thoh who art the firft

as were mofl advantageous to his perfon ; and 
as one going to converfe with the miftrefs of 
his alFeftions. Dionylius wasnataraliy hand-

afpeft. Leonas, accompanied t^ PUngon* 
aed by thofe waiting-women who were moft , 
familiar with Calliirhoe, went to her apart- 
ment, and thus addreft her : Dionyfius is 
a man of the flriiflcft juftice, and ao cxaftob- 
fcrver of the laws. He is now gone to the

to go, though with the utmoft reluAance. 
However, fhe aflumed more confidence when 
flie reflefted that 'he temple waste be the icene

thus DionyfiU3 fpake to Leonas ; and yet he 
did not defpalr of winning Caltirrhoe's affec- - 
tion by intreaties ; love naturally infpiring 
hope; and Dionylius not doubting, but that 
he Aiould obtain his wishes by kindncfs and 
aflidnity. Then fending for Plangon :

Plangon immediately underwood this com- 
maad ; fhe being an artful, fhrewd woman, 
who, wilhont by'mg much, comprehended an 
affair in an inftant ; aod thereupon nade it 
her whole Andy to perfeA it. Going then to 
Callirrhoc, &ie did not declare that any di- 
rei^ions had been given her on this occafion t 
_ but behaved with the ntmoft complacency aiid 
fcindnefi; in order that Caliirrhoe might re-

VII. In the mean time the following iod- 
' '^ent happened. Dionyfius did not leave hU 
Villa ; he bow feigning one cxcufe, then 
another } but the trne and only reafon wai, 
he could not tear himfelf from Callirrhoe ;, 
nor yet woald he take her with him to the , 
■ dty. He was fcofible that fhc, if once fccn 
there, would foon be celebrated j that her 
Wonderful beauty mud enflave all Ionia ! and 
that' the fame of it could not but reach tho 
ear of the great king. Now it happened that 
Dionyllas, having examined vety accurately 
Into the general Aate of his rural affairs ; found 
caufe. to cenfnre Phocas, hit undei-Clcwardi 
on account of a certain article. The reproof, 
however, went no farther than wordi: but 
Plangon, fcizing this oppoituntty, flew all 
trembling 
■. C 9S ] 
trembling to Callirrhoc ; when tearing licr 
hair, and clafinng her tcDces;— Good Lady 
(faid {he) fare us, I bcfcech yoD 1 Dlonyfius 
is highly exafperated at my huHund. My 
Lord is natarally very paflionate ; and, yet is 
diflingoilhed for his humanity. Thon only 
canll reft^ue us from this impending danger. 
Dionyfius, if thou butafk him, will willing- 
ly grant thee this thy firiV reqaeft. — Callir- 
rhoc was afraid of waiting upon Dionyfius ; 
and yet (he would not venture to refufe Plan- 
gon's urgent intreaties and earneft prayer ; as 
,flie was bound to her by fo many fignal obli- 
gations. That Ihe therefore might not ap- 
pear ungrateful, Ihe faid thus; 1 ajfo am 
a fervant, and have not the confidence to 
fpealt ; but if thon imaglneft, that I may have 
any influence, I am ready to add my fuppli- 
citioDs to thine; and may the gods give a 
happy ilTuc to our endeavours ! Being come 
t 93 ] 
.te Dionylins.'s apartmcDt, PlangoQ bid the 
door-keeper inform hU Lord, that Callirrho« 
attended. — ^Dionyfius was then lying down ; 
pals, funk ingrief, and half dead. Hearing 
that Callirrhoe was at the door, he was fjruck 
dumb ; and a cloud feemcd to Overfpread his 
mind at this unexpected event, fo that he 
could fcarce draw his breath ; but recovering 
it at la(t, he cried : Let her come in !— ^ 
Callirrhoe advancing near him with dowocafl 
eyes ; her cheeks were inftaotly covered with 
blufhes, when (he, with confufed accents, 
afterwards (pake in maDoer following! ' 
I oWc this favour to Plangon j for flie loves 
me as though I wcr^ her child. I therefore 
befeech thee (my Lord) not to be angry with 
her hufbnnd i but to pardon him, at my . 
humble interceffion,- She would have faid, 
more, but her voice forfook her. Dlonyfius, 
who immediately fajv through Plangon's ftra- 
tagem^ 
t SI4 ] 
tdgeth, fatd : 1 am extremely offeade4 ; 
and no perfon living fliould have faved Phocai 
and Plaflgon, from the moil rigorous pnailfa- 
inent, after the crimes (hey have dared to 
commit. I yet will pardon them willingly at 
thy requeft. Then turning to Plangon : 
Do thou (faid he) reroember, that ye were 
forgiven at Callirrhoc's defire. Plangon 
falling at her I-ord"s feet : — Rather proftrate 
your felf (faid he) before Callirrhoe, for it 
Awas flic who faved you. Plangon obferV- 
Ing joy to fparkle in Callirrhoc's eyes ; and the 
vaft pleafure the felt, now flie had obtained 
her fuit : Do thtJu (faid Ihe) return our 
mof) duiiful, and meit grateful thanks to 
Dionyftus i — at which words, (he pufhedher 
, forward. Callirrhoe happening to flip, fell 
on Dionyftas's arm ; who, at the fame limfi 
that he fcemed to fcorn to lend her his hand 
to rife, drew her towards himfelf j when hi 
7 , - gave 
t 95 1 
gUc her a kiJs; but immedUtcIy let her ga; 
in order that the artliice, employed by busy 
Blight Dot create fufpicioo. 
VIII. The women then ■weat away; but 
the kfTs, which Dionyflus had feized, glided 
like poifoD ihroagh his veins, fo that be could 
neither fee nor hear. The god of Love af- 
falled and triumphed over him on every Cide i 
and he was uoablo to find scare to his paf-" 
fioa. DionyTms, when be refle^ed on the 
greatoelii of Callirrhoc's foal, was perfoaded 
that .gifts could never win her: and, on the 
other hand, that threats muft be equally in* 
efieftual ; be knowJiig, that {he would die 
rather than fubniic to violence, Imagintng 
now that his hopes Iky in Plangon only, he 
fent for her, and fpake thus :- 'Tboa didil 
bit upon the Hrfl delightful ilratagem -, and I 
thank thee for the kifs, which has either ' 
formed 
t s« 3 
formed my felicity, or will deftroy me. Do 
thou then, who art a woman, try bow far 
thou (affiled bymeia the conteft) canft overr 
reach, and defeat, one of thine own fex. 
Know that liberty will be thy recompence ; 
and, what I am certain U Aili dearer to the« 
than liberty, the life of Dionyllus. Plangon 
having received thefe commands, had recourfe * 
to every experiment and every artifice ; hat all 
invain; Callirrhoe being invincible, and true 
to Chjereas only. Yet was (he conquered by 
the infidious wiles of fortune, which baffle 
all the exertions of human reafon : for For^ 
tune is a very contenlious geddefs, from 
wHom every thing, how unaccountable foever, 
may be expe£led. It is therefore not to be 
wondered at, that flic then brought to mani- 
lity an affair, ihat was wholly unthoiight c^,

he brought me hither ; by Venus, who firft 
pcnnted me out to thee ; and t^ Cupid, who 
leadeihmc to thee as thy bride.— This 
pleaTed DionyCus, and he immediately took 
the oath. Cupid was now overjoyed to add 
to the number of his triumphs. DionyCus's 
love iucreafing, he could not bear the thoughts 
of delaying his marriage ; it being extremely 
diiScult for man to check the gratifying of bis 
defiret. "But Dionyllus, who had receired 
an excellent education, felt a tempcft in hit 
brea(V, and his foul was pnch funk. He yet

Shall I vired, in a folitnde, and without wit-

It would argue the uiKwft meaoncfs ia me not 
. to celebrate my napiials, with Callirrhoe, jn . 
the moft rolemn manner. In the firA place, 
I ought to pay erety honour to this wosian, 
as it will iafoK myfuture felicity. Fame is 
the fleeteft Kid noft prying of all mellea*

checked progrelG. From her, things, if ever 
to flrange, caanot be concealed. She already 
flies to Sicily with the following news ; Cal-

thou, perhaps, mayeft be obliged to debate 
before the great king. It will therefore Ito 
beft for me to be able to fay thos t Being 
Infivmed that a woman of birth was, by I 
know sot what accident, broagbt to ttiis

that I am Dot unworthy of his alliance, fie

with greater fccariiy, all thy pleafarc. I 
then fhall have more influence at the cdal,.b]r

Having thus determined, kx called IfiOOMi

as thou ma jreft think neceflary. Let heiAi

be coikveycd, about the eVealag, in a barge, 
to his -houfe which Aood near the harbour 
called Dodmos, Now the firft thing done 
by Callir* hoc (who was delivered to the care 
of Plangou) before Ihc left the country, was 
to offer up prayers to Venus j when entering 
her temple, and canfing every one to depart 
from it, fhe thus addrelTed that Deity : —

when arrired at years of maturity, be will

from the temple to the fca-fhore, tbe mari-

not only in the teunples, but before thcirowa 
doors. Varions were the conjeftures who the

one of the nereids was rifeo out of the ocean '; 
or that the goddefs herfelf was come from 
Dionyfius's fylvan icenes ; the mariners hail- 
ing rpread a report, that ftie revealed herfelf

which was, to fee Caltirrhoei and. the mul-

where, purfuant to theMilcfiancuftom, thi 
tridegroom was to receive his bride. -Calf

Old people and children came from their

to bear his feparation from Calthrboe, be 
thought that death only could heal bis aa- 
gaifli. BetDg come to the Manfolaam, he 
found the flones of it had been moved, and 
that the eatrance was open. Chsreas was 
tertiHed at the fight ; and infioitely perplexed) 
as he did not know how to account for what 
he &w. Fame, that fwift-wioged mefleoger> 
{qon fpread through Syracuse tbe news of tbEs

tennined to enter, from an ardent defire he 
had to fee again his dear Callirrhoe, though 
dead ; but fearching every part of the tofflb, 
he coold not find the leaft traces of her. 
Many not believing that this could be poJSble, 
they themfelvcs refolved to go in { and doing

what had happened. One of the fpeAatoi^ 
then Qandiog ap, Cried aloud : The fu- 
nereal treafares depofited here are ftoleit, 
which muft have been the horrid work of 
robbers. But where is the dead body ?— The

I was abandoned ia the very Bower, the height 
of my paffion. What fiialt I do? What 
will become of wretched me i Shall ,1 lay 
violent hands oo my lelf i fiut with whom 
(ball I be buried? for, in the midll of my 
calamiiies, this/it^gle hope confoled me, viz. 
that though I did not long enjoy the hyme- 
neal delights with Callirihoe, yet that one 
fepulchre

I crave, is, that thouwonldeft not {hun me.— 
At thefc words the whole alTcaibly burft into 
tears } and they now were as deeply aiQi^ed, 
as before for Callirrhoe. Immediately the 
(hips put to fea ; and it was agreed that 
they Oiould take diffsreut conrfes. Hcrmo- 
crates undertook to fearch Sidly ; Chxreai 
vcDt for Lybia ; while fome were difpatched 
to Italy ; and others had orders to crols the 
-looiaa fea. Yet all thefe human eilbru were 
vain i but Fortune, without whofe aid nothing 
can be pcrfefted, brought the whole truth 
to light i as will appear in the fequel of tbefl: 
erents. ■ ■ 'The impious pyrates having fold 
the 
t "9 ] 
tfae-woman (a merchandize not eafily dirpofed 
of,) they left Miletns, and lailed towards 
Crete, kaowiog that this was a large, rich 
illaod i whence they hoped, that they fhonld 
eafily fell the refl of their cargo in it. But 
a fartoos wind ariftng, it drove them from 
their intended courfc, inio the Ionian fea, 
(that uofreqaented ocean,) whereon they, 
fad and forlorn, were long tolled. There 
dreadful ftcxms of thunder, lightning, and a 
long, long night, difmaycd thofc wretches; 
providence manifeniy evincing, that it waa 
for Callirrhoe's falce only that they, till then, 
had been favoured with fo profperousavoyage. 
Thcfe pyrates feemed at the gates of death 
every moment; but God prolonged thetempeft. 
In order thaf they might not be freed from ihnr 
terrors and come to a fatal end. The earth re- 
jected thefe mifcrcancs : for after having beeo 
long tolled about the ocean, they, at laA,

trary, they perifhed, fatiated with gold. But 
now they repented, though late, of their 
enormous crimes ; reproaching each other to

cepted) died of thiril ; he, even ia this ex- 
tremity of diftrcfs, not forgetting his wonted 
detdlable cunning ;. which prompted him to 
fteal, claodcftinely, the liquor that his com- 
panions ought to have Ibarcd ; an aftion he 
gloried in, as in all others of that fort. Here

Chxreas, though in the extremes of decrepi-

.yet be carried thither ; when clafptng his foil's

bitterly) cried : To whom, my fon 1 doft

Chxrcas, overcome by the intreaties of his pa- 
rcDts, threv himfelf froOi the itiip into the 
fca ; that he might not be prevented from 
goiog in fearch of Callirrhoe, nor torture 
any longer his father and mother. The fal- 
lors leapt in immediately after Chffireai, and 
drew him forth with much difficulty. Her- 
mocrates, feeing the multitude difperfed, or- 
dered the pilot to weigh anchor forthwith ; 
when a new incident happened, which exEi- 
bjied an a^ of the mofl generous friendlhip.

what is Dill more grlerous, I Ihould not be 
pennitted to falme thee as my couatr; wo-

with i^;ard to my own wife.^ — ^While he 
thus poured forth his lamentations, FolyclHir- 
mns nfed his otmoft cndeaTonrs to oonfolf 
him. 
VII, In the meaa time Fhocas, nnder*Ae- 
ward to Dionyfios, fpying a fiup of force, 
was not a little alarmed oa that acconnt ; when 
Jhowing much kiodnefs to one of the fiulors, 
he learnt, from him, who the perfoos on 
board were, and the motive of their Toyage. 
He then reflected, that the arrival of thisfliip 
muft be of fital confequence to his Zx>rd ; 
Imaginiog, that were Calliirhoe to be taken 
h 4 froni 
D.5,l:sJl.,GOOgIC

from him, he could not pofliblf farrfve rh« 
lofs. Bearing a great love to his mafler, he 
was extremely deflrous of putting a flop to 
the impending evil ; and of preventing a war ; 
not a mighty one, indeed, nor of a public 
nature, but pearly affe^ling Dionyfius's fa-, 
mily. For this purpofe, he rode, with the 
fwiftefV fpccd, to a forlrefs, garrifoned by 
Tome Barbarians, and fpake thus to them : — 
A /hip of force has put in here, and lies hid 
under the ramparts, which look on the Tea'; 
but whether (he be a fpy, or comes in hopes 
of a booty, I cannot tell: but fucely it will 
be much for the king's iuterell, that we take 
9nd plunder her, to prevent her doing mif- 
chief. Phocas prevailed with the Barba- 
rians, by his fallacious arguments, to goj 
and he himfelf led them in regular order. 
The barbarians then fell npon the' Ihip's 
company, who were quite unprepared for fuch 
X '53 3 
■B attack, in the dead of night ! and throv- 
iog fire into the veflcl, they burnt her ; after 
which they bound Ja chains fuch of the peo- 
ple as they found alive, and imprifoned them 
in the fortrefs. A partition being then made 
of the ilaves ; Ch^erens and PoJycharmus 
moft earneftly befought the vigors, that ihey 
might be fold to one Md the fame mafler. 
la compliance with this requcft, the purcha- 
fer of both fold them in Caria ; where drag- 
ging heavy fetters, thefe ill fated men tilled 
the lauds of Miihridaies. Now it happened 
that Callirrhoe had a dream, in which fhe 
faw Choreas In irons ; who wonld feign have 
approached her, but could not. Immediately 
(he. Tenting a loud, fad figh in her flecp, 
cried: Come hither, O my Chareasl — 
This being the firft lime that Dionyfius had 
. heard his frighted wife pronounce the name 
Qf Chffircas^ Jie a(kei her, who that perfon 
was 
C 154 3 
was whom (he called upon ? Her tear* 
betraying her, and bdog qa'ite unable to con- 
ceal her diflrers, her aognifh borft into thefe 
words: Alas ! I did addrefs my hufbaad, 
he who polTelled me i Tirgln -bride. aa- 
happy man! mUerable even in dreams. I 
iaw him loaded with irons. But thou, [moll 
Durortonate of mortals !) didfl lofe thy life ia 
fearching after me ; for thefc chains fadly de- 
note that thou art dead ; while I dill furvive, 
and riot in the moft luxurious delights. I 
sow repole, with another bufband, in a bed 
glittering with gold j yet I, ere long, will 
banco to thee ; for /loce we could not enjoy 
each other, when living ; we wdll join toge- , 
tber in death. Dionyltus on hearing thefe 
words, made a variety of reflexions. He was 
fired with jealoufy, as Callirrhoe difcovered 
a love for Chxrcas, although dead. He like- 
wife was afraid that flie would 'mate away 
with 
I .'SS 3 
with herrelf. On th« otbec hand, he enter- 
taiaed hopes, ai Ihe fcemed to fuppofe her 
iirft hnfband was no mofe ; that Ihe therefore 
would not forfalcc him who then enjoyed her. 
In the mean time, Diooyfitis ftrave to com- 
fort, by every means poilible, his affliAcd 
wife ; and watched her narrowly, dnring 
Biany days, for fear Ihe Ihould deftroy her- 
felf. The hopes Callirrboe entena^d, that 
Chxreas might, perhaps, be nil] living ; and 
that ber dream wai mere illufioo, foftencd 
her grief; bnt chieBy her pregnnncy. She 
feren months after iheir nuptials, being de- 
livered of a fon, who was fnppofcd to bo 
the ofispring of Dionyflus, though Ch^creas 
was the real father. Vail rejoicings were 
made, throughout the city, on this occafion. 
EmbaHadors came from aU parts, to Miletus, 
to congratulate Dionylius on the aufpiciou3 
incrcafi; of hts family : and fo great was his 
delight, 
' 
r »56 3 
delight, that he yielded to every thiog which 
might pleaJe his wife. He declared her ido- 
ther of a family j cronded the temples with 
offerings ; and after a folemn (acrifice* enter-> 
tained the whole city at a magoificent l>an- 
- VUI. Callirrhoe* being afraid that Plangoo 
would one day dift^over the fecret, was there- 
fore very delirous that flie might be made 
free ; this womui being the only perfon who 
knew that Caliirrhoe was prcgDaot, the firft 
night (he cohabited with Dionyfias. It was 
not merely from a principle of gratitude, that 
Callinhoe reqnefted this favour; but alfo be- 
canfe of the aafpicicus change which had 
been >s!rongbt in her fortune. 1 would 
willingly (faid Diooyfius, on this occafion) 
reward Plangon, for the ready afliflance fhe 
gave to our amour: but we were unjuft, 
fhould 
[ 157 J 
Oioali We hooonr a Have, and not ofTer af 
doe thanks to Veaas ; In whofc temple we 
firft hv each other. 1 wifh for this, (faid 
Cailirrhoe} more than thou dofk, I hsviog 
fllll greater obligatioaG to that goddefs i but 
as I am yet in chiJd-bcd, let us contioue here 
a few days longer ; and then we may retire 
with lefc hazard into the country. Cailir- 
rhoe foon recovered from the inconvenicncies 
and pains of child-birth. Her beauty ia- 
creafed with her flreugth ; her Tirgln vigour 
being now improved to that of a mother. 
When they Were arrived at the villa, they 
found that Phocas had prepared fplcndid 
fcafls 1 as a great number of people, from 
the city, attended them. And now Dionyfius, 
tiie libation being made, begnn to oifer up 
the Hecatomb, when he fpake thus: O 
Venus ! (my Deity !) To thee I owe all the. 
bledings I enjoy; (o ihee I am indebted for 
Cellitt'hoe : to thee for toy fon : by ihee i

have been conteoted with Callirrhoe only* the

parents : bnt yet I tore my foo, as I thereby 
(ecure to my fetf the affeftioa of his mother ^ 
and pollefs the fweeteft pledge of her fmd- 
aefs for me. I therefore befeech thee, [O 
goddefs t) to prcferve Callirrhoe for my 
fake ; and the Infant for her's ^The croud 
round them accompanied this prayer with 
good wilhes, and Joyful acclamations ; whett 
fome fcattcred rofes over them ; fome slolel's j 
«nd others entire chaplecs; infomuch that 
the temple .was Arewed with Aowers. Dio^ 
Dyliu3 had offered up his prayers with a lonii 
voice, and fo i.vas heard by all the people ; 
but Callirrhoe would addrefs Venus in pri- 
vate. She dierenpoB RrS\ put her fon into 
the arms of the goddefs ; when behold a

from Dionyfius, while he was deprecating 
Nemefis id Uleace. tlaviog then ordered 
Flaogoo only, to continue with her } he fent 
back all the reft to the villa. After the 
pbople had left the temple, Callirrhoe ad- 
vandog nearer to Venus, and holding forth 
the child, fajd : — ^For this ia&ot (O god- 
dcfs I) I return thee thanks, but not formy- 
fdf : which I yet fhould certainly have done, 
hadft thon prefcrved me my Chsrcas. Thou 
indeed hafl given me the image of that dearly 
beloved hnlbaud ; and not deprived rae to- 
tally of him. O grant that this babe may be

in beholding a fucce^r to hh herotfm ; and 
this will adminil^er pleafure to his parents, 
though DO longer raoked among the tJviag. 
I conjure thee, (O Venus!) to be propiiious 
to me, henceforward. My fuffcrings have 
already been very great. I have been dead 
to all appearance, and reflofed to life. I 
have been in the vile hands of robbers; 
have been loft to my country ; been fold j 
and a flave ; and, what I look upon as ftiU 
more grievous than all the reft, am joined 
to another hufband. But, to compenfate 
fully for all thcfc evils, I intreat thee, and 
all the other Deities through thy mediation, 
to prefcrvc me this haplefs orphaa. Siie 
would fain have added more, but wa£ inter- 
rupted by her tears. 
IX. Cal-

the prieftefs, who entering feid : (0 my 
daughter!) why wcepeft thou in the midft 
of fo much felicity, and when even Itrangers

youths came hither, not loDg fincc, from on

when one of them, at the fight of thy image,

to the heart ; when Ihe^ tike one diflrafled i 
looking aghaCl and with her eyes fixed, cried 
aloud : — Who were ihofe grangers ? Whence 
came they ? What did they fay to thee? 
The piieKefs was fo terribly frighted that (he, 
at fird, remained fpecchlefs ; but at lall (he,

Knowing that love is naturally over curious ;

flocking to Callirrhoe, informed her of every

known, viz that a band of robbers (Barba-

iu the dead of night, and burnt the Siciliaa 
Ihip, which had put in there the day before ;^ 
and ihat they faw, on the morrow, the ocean

his body was foon emaciated, owing to the 
variety of his fuifcnDgs} to his prodigious 
t«Is ; to his oegleft of bimfelf ; to his ch^os : 
but much more ihao all theTej to bk lore. He 
woftld gladly have died then, bad not fetee 
glimmeriagi of hope, viz. that he m^ht, 
perhaps, fee C^irrhoe oace again, kept up 
bi$ faiatiDg fpirits. His frimd Polychanoat,

beiag very healthy and robufit and no wayi 
a captive to that moft cruel of all tyrant** 
Love ; cultivated,, almofl fingly, the ground 
allotted to both ; he, with the higheft joy, 
takiog this toil upon himfelF, to lave the lifb 
of his friend. While CtuErcas and Polychar- 
maa were thus finiggliog with ill Fortnne, it 
was exceedingly difficult for them to forget 
their ooce happy Hate of liberty.. Jn the 
mean time, Mithridates the governor returo- 
ed to Caria ; not chcarful and florid as when 
he left it, in order to go to Miletus ; but pale . 
and thin, like one whole heart had received 
a deep, though pleafing wound. His paffioQ 
for Callirrhoe thus coofumiag bim j he would 
certainly have died, bad be not met with the 
following conlblation. Some of the Haves,

nnrthered tbcir keeper ; had attempted to 
make thdr ercapc, btit were prcveoted by the 
barking of dogs, placed there to watch. 
Bdog thus catched in the fa£t, they were alt 
loaded, that nighc, with heavier irons. In 
the morning, the ftcward inforffled his lord 
of thefe fevcral things; when he, without 
either feeing chem, or heariog their defcDce, 
inHanily gave orders for the craciHxioo of 
all the Hxtecn who were imprifoned together, 
and charged with the fjme crime. They 
then were bronghi forth, withchaias about 
thdr necks and feet ; every one carrying his 
crofs. Theminiflers of the torture heighten- 
ed the necelTary punilhmcnt with all this ap- 
paratus of horror, to ftrike the ftronger ter- 
ror into the reft of the ftaves. Chaereas being 
now dragged to execution, was filent ; but 
Polycharmus, who bore bis crofs, burft into

the following exclamation: -—T6 thee 
, (O Callirrhoc !) we owe all thcfe fufferingt. . 
Thou art the caufe of all onr woe. The 
fteward. hearing ihefe words, imagined that 
fome woman was an accomplice in their at- .

be punilhed, and the contriver of thefe 
plots difcovered; Polycharmus was imme-

when overwhelmed with forrow. His fonl

I would not now trouble you with unfeafop- 
able, or fuperRuons words j and am afraid 
that my friend, who is now fixed to the

in aain/tant; and their aoimolity melted into

having embafladors on board, with orders 
to feefc Callirrhoe. This (hip, when lying

My brother, and my friend ! Thy fuUen and 
unfeafoiiable Clence had like to liave proved 
fatal to theej by alluring me, as it were,

the youi^ men to the bath ; next to refrefh, 
and afterwards clothe each of them in a rich 
Grecian robe. MIthridates then invited all' 
bis friends to a banquet ; and offered up a 
Sacrifice, for Chzreas's efcape from death. 
The guefts caroazed during many hours; 
their reception was very' friendly i and no> 
thing was wanting to complcat their Teftivtty, 
During the courfe of this mirthful eater-

chains,

at thefc words, cried : .Where didft ihou 
fee my Calllrrhoc ? — She is no longer thine, 
{replied Mithridates) but the laiyful wife of 
DlooyfiUs, of Miletus ; and they have already 
a fon. Ch^ereas, unable to contain himfelf, 
fell at Miihridatcs's feet, and cried My 
Ixird ! — -Return me to my crofs. The 
forcing me to live, after fo dreadful a rela- 
tion, would be a Ilill^reater puniAiment. O
