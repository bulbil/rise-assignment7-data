by Mr. Dt&'j tVife of agr Pmvnto. 
ON my arrival at Rome, I *w re* 
commended to a lodging? in the 
houfe of Madam Oaianti, ibppofed to bo 
a widow with a numerous family of chit* 
cbea. When- 1* firft entered the houfe, 
flie &etxied furprifed* but ibis did not

ta that difgulfe, rather more than com- 
monly agreeable, . She took care to 
attend me with great afliduity ; but, 
whenever lhe xame into ray prefence, 
Ihe feemed defirous of faying fome- 
Wring, but the festr of offending pre- 
vented her fjpeech. As (he feemed to 
be a woman of great prudence, I one 
day took the opportunity to afk her, if 
ihe had any hufband living ? Ah ! Sir, 
laid fhe, with tears in her eyes, if he 
wsp' living I fhpuld not be fubje& to 
thefe difficulties to maintain my fami- 
ly r I had the happinefs to be married 
ta an honeft worthy man, by trade a 
timber-merchant 5 about twelve years 
ago he went from Venice to Leghorn, 
and taking with him a considerable fum 
io trade with, was certainly murdered 
on the road, for from that time to this 
I have never heard of him. At thefe 
words the tears flowed from her eyes, 
and I, to my great aftonifliment, was 
convinced that I muft be in the houfe, 
and talking to the wife of Duii, the 
jncrchant whom I had met .with on 
my way to Paris. I could fcarcely a- 
iroid through pity jto inform her that 
her hufband was ftill alive, -and trading 
in France under another name ; reflect- 
ing, however, upon the jcircumftance 
j.. . of 
c 3 y 
of the Princcfs, who, as Duli had in* 
formed me, was brought to bed in his 
houfe, and comparing with this the con- 
fufed account of Madam Caferdo, I judg-r 
ed it would be> proper to proceed with' 
Caution, and ufed my beft endeavours 
to comfort her 5 after which, pretends 
ing to be looking oyer the things in mp 
little box, I pulled out the Duchefs's 
pifture^ and laid it upon the table ii* 
fuch a manner that fhe could not r avoi& 
feeing it. This contrivance arifwered 
my expe&ations ; (he firft lookcdiled- 
feftly at the picture, then at my face 
with, great amazement: I then afked 
her the caufe of her furprize? No- 
thing, Sir, anfwered ihe, but I was 
doubting whether that was not yotfr 
pi&ure, and whether you had not in 
joke dreflcd yourfelf like a woman* 
Why, faid I, does it refemble me ? It 
irefembles you fp nufch, Replied fhe; 
that I would infift upon it to be yours* 
if I did not know the original. It is, 
faid I, my mother's, but you could not 
know, her. If yoxir mother was the 
Duchefspf ****, replied ihe, I knew, 
her before you; and as I believe you to 
be a gentleman of honour, may ven- 
ture to inform you that theDucheft 
was brought to bed in my houfe, fome 
B 2 years 
«) 
years ago, of a fifter of yours in tihfe* 
rery room, and as foon as I faw ycm I 
Aifpe<fted you to be her fan, fo ftrongly 
are her features imprinted in my mind; 
fcut not being certain of it, I ihouki 
sever have mentioned it hid 1 not feen 
that pi&urc in your hand. I*no longer 
doubted of what Duli had told nte? a 
thousand fentimenf s of confufioft, curi-. 
ofity, and joy, fprungin upon my 
imnd ; I immediately fuppofed myfclf 
to be child to the Duchefs, and mere-.- 
fore thought myfclf happy - y 1 fuppof* 
ed that th* urgency of the Druchefs, for 
ifie to go and get fome news of the.fu^ 
E'tive, fpoke in my favour* I attributed 
t impatience not to her hatred againfir 
the Duke, her hufband, as Madan* 
Cafardo made me believe, but to the 
tendernef* of a mother ; even in Ma- 
dam Cafardo 1 found juft reasons for 
her concealing 1 the truth in a fecrot of 
foch importance, and whatever doubt 
I had of being wrong in my conje^tuBes^ 
might eafily be cleared up, by aflcing 
my landlady, Without running any rifle 
of being known : I pretended that I 
was no ftranger to all which (he had 
told me ; and aiked her, if ihe knew 
What became of my fitter that was borer 
in her Jioufc ?. My hufband, faid fbe/ 
accom- 
(5) 
accompanied her, at the age of four" 
years, by the order of the Duchefs; to 
a convent at Avignon, to be brought 
up there with her equals, fince which 
time I never have heard any thing of 
her; I would willingly hear of her by 
fending a letter to the Duchefs, but 
I know that before her marriage (he had 
fome correfpondence with the Prince of 
* * * *, and the Duke being as jealous 
a man as any under the heavens, too 
much regard I judged could not be 
.taken in an affair which demanded the' 
greatef! fecrefy : in fa& 9 inftead of her ; 
voyagrto Spaing Ihe ftaid two months inr 
this room,- nor did even the air know it ; 
if the fecret had been in other hands, 
woe to the poor Duchefs , but, thank 
God, I am a woman that can keep a* 
fecret, neither in fo doing have I ex* 
ceeded my duty *■ ihe being a Neapoli-' 
tan, I know her y I may fay from heif 
childhood, and ihe would have done* 
wrong if ihe had notentrufted me with, 
a matter of fuch confcquence. White 
Madam Galanti was borffting of her fe-« 
Crfcfy, I took care, from the beginw 
ing, not to tell her any more about 
myfelf then what ihe already knew p 
the confidence placed in us: by others* 
ought to make us fincere and not im-

and the Neceffity f was under cf going

AFTER allthefeTefle^iom,wy ; 
obligation* to Macboi Gateat;i 
were fuck that I determined, in xeturja,: 
to give her the happy pnofpe&of feeing! 
owe more her huibaad, telling her, that 
I h*d met in France with* gentiewan,* 
called by the ostme of PuK, wl*>fe 
country, family, and the circumftancc* 
of his bankruptcy, induced me to. be- 
lieve that he was the perfon fhe funpof- 
cd to be dead ; at firft the would not 
believe that her feufbapd was capable to 
be guilty of fuch an a6tio», but when 
I gave her t defcriptiott of his perfon* 
bar fofpickni that it muft be him in-; 
created greatly ; and finally when I 
Jhewed htr the copy of the letter 
which he wrote for Die to Mr. D'Ar- 
core, flie was fully convinced, and be- 
gan to lament bitterly her misfortunes* 
and asked me, what it was that could 
poffibly 
* err. 
poffibly detain him from his femtly and " 
country ? I told her that it was the fear 
f his creditors.; : tajwhicj* fhe replied, .. 
that there were but a. few of t hem to 
fatisfy, and that lie might return home 
without fear or rookftation. Upon 
this I pronufed that, on my return to 
France, I would make diligent fearch 
for him, and fend him back to Rome* 
The poor woman was much comforted, 
by my promife ; but I was under ter* r 
riblc apprehenfions, left by her means 
I might be difcovered to be /on to the 
Duchefc of * * # *, which news being 
known in the French camp, and evcro 
as far as Paris, might carry with' it fa^ 
tal confequences ; at the fame time tot 
unfay what I had already, told her, 
was not a&tng like the; man of honour v 
to recommend it as a fecret, would be* 
making her doubt of my candour ;♦ 
therefore I muft let it paft as i had firftf 
represented it, and truifc to my deftiny 5* 
though by way of precaution, I told> 
her, that my journey to Rome was* 
not known byxny mother, and that fhe' 
befierdd hie to be in the army : whe- 
ther Madam Galanti believed it or not, 
while I flayed in Rome fhe did sot 
mention it to any one : my intereft* 
however, would not pern^t me to ftay 
in 
( 8 ) 
in Rome any longer, and the orders of 
the Marfliall calling me to the army 
before Eafter, I, in a few days, bid 
adieu to my courteous landlady, and 
took the road to Lombardy. The 
more I refle&ed upon my journey, the 
more I found myfclf perplexed ; I 
knew, and was certain, that theDuchefs 
£  » m was m y mother, and my 
father the Prince of * * * *, already my 
proteftor, but knew not how to own him, 
I being the fruit of unlawful nuptials ; I 
ought to believe that the giving of me 
life fbould make them blufh ; I looked 
on myfclf accountable* for the caufe 
which had conducted me to be the in* 
nocent fpoflator of my mother's 
amours with my father, which to me r 
more than to another, might haver 
turned out dangerous, and were fatal 
even from the cradle ?. and I ought to 
tcmembef, that eternal Providence,: 
that permitted the Duke to feek my 
death by various means; yet would 
not have me, for juft reafons r to be 
the victim of his revenge. 
As long . as the Duke lived, I muflr 
not hope from him, new from my pa-* 
-rents, better treatment; knowing then* 
more of myfelf than themfeives, I- 
ought to keep from. Paris that I might 
not 
<9') 
nM be trt contfaroal danger, Superior t* 
my.ability from prudence and nature* 
Adieu, Paris, faid I, who knows when: 
I fhali fee you again ? and who can tetk 
mCf whether, in my prefect fituationy 
it behoves me to repine at my deftinyh 
Thefe refle&ions accompanied me ©n> 
my journey to Milan, nor would they* 
day of night, give me any itepofe ; the 
occupations of the campaign in no 
fhape light <tned my affliftions, but »* 
ther inqrlafcd them ; I always wiihed 
for a fecond battle, in which I might 
by down my miferabfc life : in faft, : a 
feco&4 battle enfiaed that fame year, in 
the, neighbourhood d£ Gnaftalla^ but I 
had no other fhareriri it than to obferve 
k at a diftanee, being ppfttd with my 
balallion out of the teach of: the ene* 
toy's fire. The vkftwy declared fear 
tis, though with confiderabk loft on 
our :fide, aiu4 J yceht thatfaine evening 
to congratulate the Marihali on ht£ 
fuccefs ; Ke, a* firft fight of me, faid, 
You have aAed right, I was juft em 
quiring after you; you are not wounded 
this battle, therefore get ready to de* 
part for Paris within thefe two hours, 
for as foon .as the difpatch is ready you 
imtft fet out for that court. The fhot 
that I received at the battle of Parma, 
made 
(10} 
it&de fefs fmpreffion upon me than tfcir 
command of the Marfhall, nor war 
there any method to difpenfe with it, 
that being an honour cpveted by every 
one in fuch cafe>, becaufe it is the* 
means of their advancement ; nor is it 
conferred upon any but thofewhoare 
efteemed at court : in regard to racy ir 
was the fame as if I was going to be ex-> 
ccuted ; the Duke, Duehefs, the Prince, 
and Count Termes, were all objects for 
me of confufion and horrof ; I was 
fure of being discovered, I feared be- 
ing puniflied ; the leaft that could be- 
fall me, was to be fcandalifed > I la* 
mented my cruel fate, and implored: 
the protection of heaven in favour of 
an innocent ; I called for death to ft- 
jnifh my roifcry, but vain were . the la^ 
mentations of my poor difiraded heart t 
At eleven at night. I was obliged to 
mount in a poft-chaife, and depart for 
Verfaiiles. 
. Imagine the thoughts which paired in 
my mind during this journey; I could 
not now evade the execution jrf my or- 
ders by flight, as I had done at other 
times j my bufinefs was an , affair of 
ft ate, and if I tranfgreffed in it, I ihould 
not think myfelf fecure in the fartheft 
confines of the world; and I muft 
haftea 
(« ) 
Jiaften night and day to* proceed to Pa- 
ris, when at the fame time I was defi- 
'Tous of befog as far as I poffibly could 
from it ; and when I refle&ed in what 
manner J (hould be able, when I arriv- 
ed there, to efcape the dangers which 
threatened me, I knew not on what to 
refolve. With thefe troubles in my 
mind I arrived at Lyons, and waited 
upon Mr,. D'Arcore while my dinner 
was getting ready, but, luckily for me, 
he was not at home $ I then returned to 
the Poft-office, where I found a courier 
from Verfailles who was going to Italy; 
I Tcnow not how it happened, but I ac- 
cidentally aiked him if he had any let- 
ter for me? telling him at the fame 
time my navne ; I have, Sir, replied he, 
and immediately delivered one into my 
Jiand. I faw by thedire&ion that it came 
from Madam Cafardo, andhaftened to 
my room, impatient to read it, and, on 
opening it, found the contents to this 
tffefl; 
" Doar3h> . 
I giye you great news in a few lines, 
becaufe the courier is juft going out : 
the Duke is dead, after a fhort but vi- 
olent fever, and the Duchefs will be ef- 
pQufsd to the Prince in a few days * 1 
now 
< tl) 
-now hopfe for the pleafute of feeing 
you at the end of the campaign. Adieu. 
* ; i f 
This intelligence called me from 
death to life ; thfc Dufce being gone, 
rty circuftiftances wore -a different af- 
peft; I wasncwr more anxious to get 
to Paris, than, belfere receiving this 
tetter, I was to be at a diUanee from 
it y not ihouid I have had patience to 
flay for dinner, had ix>rMt\ D'Arcore 
come in, who detained me a few < mo- 
ments V after whidh i proceeded <on my 
journfcy, much more contented than 
when I firft fet out. 
C HA Pi IfL 
Honours conferred \>%m at Ftrfailks; and 
news received of Xlount Termes being in 
the Bajtile. 
VlY chief fludy, during nay jour* 
JLV1 ney to Verfailles, was, how t* 
regulate myfeif in my prefent circum- 
fiances: the affair was delicate to the 
Jaft point; f advanced towards my pa- 
rents, but kneMr not how they Aright 
look upon fetch a child $ they may in* 
deed very readily know me to be their 
child; 
child, but who knows if they wiH be 
willing to expofe to the public the 
weaknefs . of their -youth, and. would 
much rather. confine me in a cloyfter, 
or at leaff ih feme priarince di&mt from 
the court:, the befti ftep therefore for 
me to take, was, not to make myfelf 
known to my .parents, unjeft I ihould 
fee that I could . do it with fecurity ; 
but how; could I keep myfeif fecret at 
Verfailies, when the prefence of Count 
flFermes was fufficient to difeover me ? 
having ailed with juft reafons in re- 
proaching his infidelity, it would be be* 
ncath my cfcara&er to entreat his fecre- 
cyj^and at the fame he, being unfaith- 
ful, might willingly betray me through 
motives of prejudice or intereft. In- 
volved in thefe thoughts, I unexpected- 
ly arrived .within half a jnile of Ver- 
iailles before I had the Jeaft fufpicion of 
being near it, and was roufed from my 
-lethargy by the noife of coaches, and 
.the greai cancourfc of people upon the 
road ; I was drefled in my regimental 
r uniform, ami. an alarm being fpread 
that I brought an exprefs from Italy, I 
1, -was no foohergot into Verfailies, than 
I was furrounded by a multitude of 
!pebfde, evefy one curious to know the 
! purport of my difpatches. Being un- 
Vol. IL - C * accuf- 
Ik 
( HY 
accuftomed to expeditions of this fort, 
I knew<not where to difmount; nor to 
whom I ihould give the Marshall's ad- 
vices : I refolved however to ,drive to 
the palace of the Prince ot *** */ my 
father. As good' 1 tick would have it 
the Prince was at home, and, as foon 
as he Jaw me, he ran to meet me, fay- 
ing, that he cxpe&ed me every mo- 
ment : this to me fcemed Grange ; but 
it was natural to chink, that, after the 
death <rf thb Duke, he had wrote to 
the Marshall to fend me to Versailles oil 
the firA occafion; but the ohly thought 
I had then, was to -execute my com- 
million ; therefore, beforfc any thing 
«lfe, I told' him mytbufijarifc, and asked 
his advice which way to proceed I 
will tell yoa, fays the Prince, with more 
joy than at firft, and ordering his coach 
to be got teady, bade me follow him, 
for he would prefent -me to the King 
himfelf. The Prince^immediat^ly ooa- 
duAed me to die King, who received 
me with great affability, and, after he 
had read the Marshall's letters, asked 
me the particulars of the battle of Guafc 
talk and Pamna, of which I fully in- 
formed Him ; he feemed much pleaied 
with ttly anfwers, and fold, that I hajl 
ioirit fuperior to my age,- aad that he 
' -. - '- ./. —would 
^rouia not forget *o; reward* mfc for my 
-great expedition ; he- likewife ordered 
me hot to return ib Italy > uniefs it was 
by his tomiaartd. : Wh€n I came back' 
-ihttf tKe*\'antt^h*iiberi'I 'found th« 
new* bf tlic vi&ory Ttfisi : known to w* 
ry orie,- and all prefifoft'were folltcifcnW, 
as is common <nr fiidi oecafion*; to en- 
quirt* after fac wfelfkte df thteirfHend*

ihotild be there and unluckily take no- 
tice tit* me i not finding Mift in that 
multitude I thought myfeif very for- 
tunate, and haftened from that place 
left he Aiould drop in at lift. I went 
dire&ly to the Duchefs; who already 
knew of my avriral, i»d -was waiting 
with impatience tp fee itaar T do not 
know, Madart*, feid 1, kiifing he*

my joy in fedrig you; 6h my return, in 
&> happy a'fkuattoir. We will not' talk*, 
faid fhe, of things 'thit are paft; my 
troubles being ifiniftiecPby the death of 
the Duke, yours, 1 on' that accounr, 
pught likcvViie to be ended : I have* the 
greateft of pleafdre in feeing you, and 
have a hundred things to tell you; but 
you have now occafion for reft, there* 
C z fore 
( *6» 
fore go to your former apartinenf, r#- 
frefh yourfelf, and to-morrow I will fee 
you again. From the (Pushefsl went 
to Madam Cafardo, who threw her 
arms about my neck, andalraoft fmo- 
thered me with kifles; I had no reafon 
to objeft to this familiarity, but I 
thought^ had flie known all fhe would 
not have taken ft* imjfth p leafture in it: 
I told h<r, in 3 few words, all that Jhad 
happened tor me in J tato; but I alfo 
wanted to obtain from her fome news of 
Count Termes, therefore it was proper 
to talk of every, thing, to draw her in- 
fenfibly to difconrfe on that fubje<3 ; in 
fpeaking of the Dufce, I asked her, how 
the Duchefs accomplished , her defigp 
concerning/the girl that flew froril Avi&* 
lion? I. will tell yoq, replied flie, for 
fince the Duke is dead we may fpeak 
more . at large 2 that girl, called Mi£ 
D'Arvjlle* was ,not daughter !to t t hc 
£)uk*, >ut to the Prince of * * * * and 
the Duchefs, who was with child by 
the Prince who expe^ed her in marri- 
age, when flie was obliged, by the po* 
licy of her parents, to marry the I?uke; 
and the pretended journey tot Spain was 
only a fcheme that ihe might be brought 
to-bed in fome private place, for the 
fake of her reputation and life: this 
fcheme 
l 
e *7 * 
fcheme turned out wandarfaEy w^J*j 
and at Rome flic -was deli rcred of a 
daughter* but thit> aflair being known* 
by mare than one/ for our better fe~ 
cxrrity, we thought of a contrivance to 
prevent the Dukc'x raiftruft ; Jvfadam 
Fralla, waiting-maid to the Duehefs* 
my niiftrcfs, had a private cqrrdjpw^ 
dence with the Duke before he iftftrr*e& 
the Ducheft, fa we refetacd that M*n 
dam Fralle Jhcfukt fey ihe was with, 
child by the Buke, and tfcat het* ifttfH 
tion was the oecafkm of our deftrrsfog 
the journey to Spain; and* that in £* 
Jftoft time after the child .was barn, ifc 
wai fent to the retiremedt at Avignon* 
from whence it at laft ran away * thft 
Duke beltared all this hiftory tor real 
truth, nor did he ever ft) much as fuf- 
pea theDoehefs to be -the mother of it t 
! continued to esquire after it from 
time to time, ; of the governrfs of 
Avignon, and fbnt theilccefl&ry fyppUet 
for her maintainance : the beft expedi- 
ent, fo* the fecttriiy of the Ducbeft* 
and m>Mfc let the poor child be turned* 
was,toitempfe her with rood words, and 
tfwu her up in the cloyfter ; according** 
ly I w^ote with my own hand to the 
governefs, and to hcrfelf, as if I bad 
been her mother 3 but the thing did not 
C 3 turn 
( i8 ) 
fufn out as wc expe&ed, for Mifs 
D'Arville, in company with her maid, . 
ran away from the convent, nor have 
we had any account of- .than finer they . 
left that place: you know that tlie.. 
Duchefs would hseve perfuaded you to 
go in fearch of her, under pretence 
that ihe wanted to divorce herfelf from. 
the Duke, and you delivered yourfelf 
from that troubkfom6 tafk by your 
flight, in which yoa a&ed like a man 
of fenfe, and a good fetvant to your* 
xniftrefs; but when you departed from 
France, flic did. not give. over the 
thoughts of fearching for her daughter, 
for nature ipoke too highly in her fa* 
tour; ihe fufpt&ed that Mifs D'Ar- 
ville held a fecret correfpondencc with 
Count Termes, and, to prevent this, 
ihe contrived to fend him to the army 
in Italy ; and after you went away, ike 
fuppofing that he muft know fomething 
0f her, had him recalled! back to Ver- 
failles; this alfo was in vain, he fwore 
and protefted he had no news of her 
fince her departure from Avignon ; 
at that time they pretended to believe 
him, but, after the death of the Duke* 
he was found to be felfe in his protef- 
tetions and oath*. 
The 
(19) 
The Prince and the Duchefs, who 
were urgent to find their child, (for the 
Duke .being dead they were under no 
appr£henfion$) .would not. give credit 
to the Count's relation, but contrived 
to have his papers fearched ; the vififr 
was made uftdcr other pretences; fix 
days ago, by order from the court, all 
the papers that were taken from him 
were put into my hands; I having a 
letter of Mifs D'Arville, could com- 
pare the chancers together, and, in 
fa&, amongft his writings I found three 
tetters that arc undoubtedly hers, but 
without name or date, fo we cannot 
difcove* whese fhe is, but only find by 
her letters that {he loves him : the infin- 
cerity of Count Tcnnes has irritated 
the Prince, and more fo the Ducheis,. 
who pretends that he muft yet know* 
more, but will not fpeak; in confe- 
quence of which tjhcy caufed him to be. 
flaut up in the Baftile, from whence lie 
will not get his liberty till he gives fur-, 
ther information of Mifs p'ArviUe.

and this uncertainty made me abfdutc*

has already appeared that I had juft 
reafon to be difgufkd with Count 
Tcrmcs, and I can really fay, that I 
came to Paris, more with ardifpofition 
to forget him than to love Hm ; but 
.when are we fettled in our paffions ? the 
honour of Connt Terriies in keeping 
fecret what little he knew of me, by 
hiding my letters, was a crime to my 
parents, but in my eyes it was .the zh 
of a hero * to be imprifoned for my 
caufe in the BafHle, he merited my 
heart and pardon for thd offence of his 
fuppofed infidelity. Thus am I again ia

mbration for his ; imprisonment, and 
burning with defire at leafttofpeak to 
him, to thank him for hisimcerity, to 
enjoin him filence, and aflure hini of my 
gratitude. This thought troubled me 
above all others,, for fa long as the 
Count concealed, me, I thought I could 
not be difcovered by any one eUe. Lit-

Having left the apartment of- Ma- 
dam Cafardo, after this! general dif~ 
courfe, I went to my own apartment*, 
where I found Mr- Befone, who waited 
to receive me: there $ we patted great 
part of the night in talking of the af- 
fairs of Italy ; I told him of >iny meet- 
ing with Mi6 Gianettort at Turin anil 
Milan, and of what had 'happened to 
me by Tartar, in Italy $ and he told 
me the? reafons fox* whirii that villa to 
had loft the Duke's protection, and was 
obliged: to fly from France, which,, as 
they J were things of the. mbfiy&tatod&- 
lous nature, and can afford the reader 
neither pleafure or profit, I ihall &- 
mit to mention them here j it is true 
indeed, that books, like a looking-

it is doing fuch villains too much ho- 
nour to mention even their names, as I 
I have got fo much of my own to write 
that I cannot lofe time to write for 
others. When I was byrayfejf, I be- 
gan to refleft by what means I could get 
to fpeak with Count Termes ; I "knew, 
by mfy own experience, how ctofely the 
prifoners in the Baftiie wfcre confined, 
and that to get periwffion to' {peak to 
any of them, -I mufl Ihavie an order 
from the King :himielf: by means of 
the Prince I thought 1 couid get ftich 
jpermiffion, but the very , propofel oF 
my (peaking with Count Tennes, would 
awaken his fu(pickm, and hazard my 
ctartvfafety : Janefon, who was my com- 
panion in the Baftiie, providentially 
came into my mind, erf whom, fince I 
left that place, I never before once 
thought; to this unhappy man the 
Prince owed fome fort of an obligation, 
and I was much obligated to him, for 
he was a very great comfort to me, nor 
oughf I fo long to have forgotten him ; 
if I can but contrive to fpeak to him, 
faid I, within myfelf, who knows but 
that by his means I can atfo (peak to 
Count Termes, or at leaft give him a 
letter. Flattered with thefe hopes I re- 
folved to venture that ftep, and give the 
Prince my reafons to mak,e Janefon a 
vifit ; the doubt that yet remained to be 
decided, was, to know if janefon was ;j 
♦ftili in the Baftile, or tf<hc had recover- 
<ed, as he expe&ed in afhort time, his 
liberty ; to inform myfelf of this was 
not difficult, the firft time I faw the

Prince. I Idexteroufly entered int<J> dif* 
courfe about the Duke, and of the 
trick he ferved us, when we were ar- 
retted in the Baftile^L then; as if it 
had juft come into my mind, asked 
him if poor Jandbn was yet in prifon? 
That is right, replied the Prince, I 
muft get him a pardon ; I thought of 
it fohie time ago, but it went out of my 
mind again. How willingly, feid I, 
would I fee him to put hiia ia good 
heart, by giving him a few bottles of 
Burgundy. If you defire it, repli- 
ed the Prinee, I can get you that 
permiffion the firft time you' go to Pa- 
ris. I fliaU take it as a particular fa- 
vour, anfwered I, as I have got fome 
bufiajefs of* my own to tranfa£ at Parts 
the latter end of next week. Well, 
faid he, remember me in time, I may 
perhaps have fome good news to fend 
him. 
We faid no more upon that head ; my 
heart was over-joyed to have obtained 
my wifh, and in a few days after I re- 
membered the Prince of his promife, 
telling him, that I muft go to Paris the 
next day ; Hoagajre me a billet which 
was fufficient for my purpofe, and 
charged me to afiure Janefon, from him, 
that in two weeks at moft he fhould 
. have 
( 25 ) 
have Ms liberty. When I arrived at 
Paris I put xtp at an inn, nor did I 
think of doing any thing that day, for 
it was too late. They asked me if I 
fhoukl ofojeS to eating my flipper with 
two Italians, who dfcfired company ; 
after the knowledge of my birth, 1 con- 
sidered myftH to be an Italian likewife, 
and had that partiality for my own 
country which is natural in us all ; I 
rejoiced oi>thk occafion to bear them 
company, and anfwered, tha* I fhoufd 
cfteem it a favour. They were man 
and wife, as they told me, and at ther 
ftrft words they fpoke to me, I knew, 
by their accent, that the woman wa? a 
Venetian and the man a Neapolitan. 
We fupped merrily, and difcourfed 
about Venice, which I praifed as it me- 
rited, but was- greatly furprifed when 
Madam very imprudently asked me, if 
I knew in Venice that Frenchman who 
was arretted one night in miftake for 
the waiting-maid of fuch a perfon? 
naming the gentleman who was fo cour- 
teous to me. Too much fincerity with 
thofe of whom we have but little know- 
ledge, is dangerous ; I told her, coolly, 
that I even did not hear him fpoke of* 
She then: began to tell me the ftory, in 
fuch a manner, that I was certain fhe 
Vol. II. D was 
( 26 ) 
was the very perfon who ran away from 
fuch a worthy matter ; and, In truth, 
though at firtt I liked her company, it 
now began to be a horror to me 5 gnd 
when I faw in her a young girl flown 
from the worthieft of men, I judged 
that flie merited the hatred of all mejfc 
and the particular vengeance of heaves. 
1 had taken the refoiution to acquaint 
her mailer, and would have performed 
it, and have procured her, with her 
unlawful hufband, to be arretted im- 
mediately, if I had not believed, that, 
by fending her to Venice, it would be 
making him a, prefent not worthy of 
acceptance ; the ftory of their amo- 
rpus adventures is too immodeft to 
hive a place in thefe my memorials,

I had been there fcarcely half an hour

IPrefented myfelf to the governor of 
the Baftile, and delivered to him the 
billet* which I had received from the 
Prince, to get permiffion to fpeak with 
Janefon, whom I found in another room 
more commodious than the former, 
where he was writing as ufual, consent* 
td with his deftiny like a modern Die* 
genes in his butt. I thought at the light 
of me he would have ran mad with joy ; 
Quonam meb fato fieri die am, faid he, in 
Latin, as if he had been talking to one 
of the do&ors of the Sorbonne, then 
mixed it with fome French, wonder- 
ing, after fo long an abfence, I fhould 
think of him. After mutual expreffi- 
ons of friendship, I aflccd him what he 
was writing ? he anfwered, that it was 
a Comedy, called, The Philolbpher 
Married 5 to perfuade, by his example, 
all other lettered men not to marry. I 
read one (bene of it, which was written 
with real fpirit ; but my mind was in- 
tent upon objetfts of greater confc- 
quencc to me : I afked him, if he was 
always alone ? or whether they fiill per- 
mitted 
(35) 
nritted him to keep company with other 
prifoners in the Baftile? he replied, that 
he was generally alone j that he had li- 
berty indeed to keep company with 
Count Termes, who had been com- 
mitted to that piace twenty days ago, 
but that the Count never would fyeak, 
and was always melancholy, fo that he 
could reap no fatisfa&ion by fitting with 
him. I know this officer, faid I, and 
wonder for what he came here ; but I 
would willingly fee him, if poffible. 
Leave that to me, laid Janefon ; but I 
muft firft (hut the eyes of my keepers. 
Any thing that you want, anfwered I, 
is at your fervice; and I will flay and 
dine with you, provided you promtfe 
to let me have a good dinner. You 
need not doubt me, replied Janefon; 
wait a little, and I will be back prc- 
fently. So laying, he went out to 
fpeak with the keeper, nor did he re- 
turn for a considerable time. I was de- 
termined to dine there, that I might 
catch an opportunity to fpeak with 
Count Termes by himfelf, while Jane- 
fon was employed in preparing the din-

delivered of a child; but as I knew 
that my felf had no ihare therein, I ne- 
ver enquired whether it was dead or a- 
live. This was the child of Madam, 
Gafardo, and the perfon who conduc- 
ed it to me 'was the nurfe, who fuppo- 
fing me to be hufband to Madam Ca- 
ftrdo, took me alfo for the father o? 
the child, and thought it would give 
me a pleafure to fee it, flattering her- 
felf with the hopes of getting a prefent 
from me. This thing, diverted me in- 
wardly,- but prudence required that iiv 
this fcene I fhould ftill maintain the 
character I appeared in, and accept the 
title of Papa. I at laft got rid of them, 
by giving the nurfe a prefent, and tel-

1WTO Sooner had I fat down to 
3L1I write to the Count, but a page 
from thePrince came to me, fay ing, thste 
the Prince defired to fpeak with me : at 
this meflage my blood .fan chill in eve- 
ry vein, .as if 1 had been informed of 
romeiuddeh accident ; I had no motive 
to fear any thing, but I, knowing my- 
felf to be unfortunate, tore what I had 
wrbte into a hundred pieces, becaufe I 
waiildnot venture to keep it about me f 
nor truft it under a lock, frightened by 
thfc experience of what had happened 
to the Count ; fo torn, I tolled it into 
the open ftreet, and then went to the 
Prince, whom I found walking about 
in his cabinet which joined to the door 
of the Duchefs's apartment ; the cur- 
tain of her door was down, nor did I 
hear any one in her room; I aflced 
him, what were his commands? As 
you are ready, {aid he, to depart for 
Italy, I have got a commiffion for you 
to execute, which is of the utmoft im- 
portance. This beginning revived my 
fpirits, 
^ 
(5! ) 
fpirits, but little did I fufpeft how it 
was to finifh. The affair which we 
are going to treat of, faid he, mult be 
managed with a nicienefs fuperior to 
your age and experience ; I know that 
you have abilities and fpirit, but, to 
Frevent: any mifcarriage in this defign* 
will give you in writing the manner 
ia which you muft regulate your con- 
du& 5 the inftru&ions will be ihort * I 
will dl&ate, and you may fit down 
there and writQ. 
It will be needlefs for me to tell how 
I was ftruek with horror at fuch a com- 
mand ; beqaufe, let any one put them- 
fclve? in my circumftances, they will 
foon guefs at the fource of my fears, 
and have motives to tremble for my 
feke : I knew that the Prince had three 
letters of mine which were wrote to the 
Count, and paffed a little before undej? 
his eyesj and as much as I could al- 
ter my writing, I knew how eafy it 
would be to fee the refemblance, if hq 
fhould confront them to each other ; it 
feemed almoft incredible to me, that I 
had not forefeen, amojigft all others, this 
danger alfo, and I repented my impru- 
dence in trufting, the Count with the in- 
fallible figns of a fecret fo long con- 
cealed by me 5 I detefted the effe&s of 
F 2 an 
'(5*) 
an amorous paffion, which had Wind- 
ed me to the fign of betraying myfelf ; 
and made a firm rcfolution, if I could 
furmount this difficulty, never to hazard 
myfelf again* But unhappy arc thofe 
wno repent too late. While I was mak- 
ing thefe reflexions, I faw they were in 
vain; my cafe demanded immediate 
remedy, nor was there any other 
refburce than that of obeying without 
hefitation, otherwife I fhould (land felf- 
condemned. I fat down to his desk, 1 
and trembling began to write, while 
he, walking about, dilated to me. I 
iifed all my art to alter my chara&er 
that it might not be known; I flattered 
myfelf that he had not taken notice of 
me ; but how was I loft when he find* 
denly drew nigh, and caft his eyes at 
the few lines I had fo badly wrote f 
You have almoft fpoiled, fard he, 
within thefe two years, your writing ; 
ibr before you left Paris, you did not 
write fo bad. I do not know, anfwer- 
cd I, but my writing was always the 
fame : but in my anfwer he faw my 
confufion. It is not true, replied the 
Prince, becaufe I have a billet of yours, 
which you wrote to me the night you 
was put in prifon at Paris, and the cha- 
racter is quite different  look, and de-

My agitation on that fatal night was fo 
vioknfc that it prevented my refle&tng 
on what I was about, nor did I remem* 
bey #> repair the damage I had com* 
mitted on myfelf. Thus, through want 
of one neceflary. reflexion, my bu&i- 
ing% in - which I fo much confided, hm 
tumbled to the ground; here I art 
proved, by my own hand* writing, to 
be the fugitive of Avignon. At thefe 
laft words of the Prince, I know not 
what paflfed in my foul ; the pen dropt 
from my hand, and I remained >Like 
one thunder-ftruck : burfting at hft 
into a flood of tears, I threw myfetf jtf

to* you I have not before difcovered my-

this is a difhonour to y 6\n k is in your

and I (hall die content, if I die by the 
hand of him that gave me lifer t if m 
this you will not be inhuman; to roenor

you for an enemy, and I will fuffer 
iWiJth patience not to have vou as a fa-

* The Prince was ftruck dumb ar my 
lpeech, without any other motion thai* 
lifting his hands to his eyes, by way of 
hiding his tears; for at my words there 
dropt from his eyes a fliower of tears, 
nor did he offer to raife me from the 
ground, but fuddenly drew afide the 
curtain of the Duchefs's door, faying, 
Madam, come here; behold your child. 
My child! replied the Duehefs, then 
the character of that billet does not de- 
ceive us, nor are we wrong in our firf- 
pirions. No, Mad 4m, faidl, you arc 
ix>t wrong, nor do I wrong you ; only 
give me leave to go to my apartment, 
and I will produce two letters, wrote by 
your orders to the governefs of Avig- 
non and myfclf. There is no occafton 
for that, replied the Duehefs, for na- 
ture has aiways fpoke to me in your 
ikvour ; alas ! why was I deaf to your 
voice till now ? but well for me that I 
did not hear it ; becaufe, my dear 
child, it might have been fetal to us 
both. Here ihe could hold no longer 
her tears $ Ihe lifted me from the

gulatiag our conduft with the diftatcs 
of human reafon, why is not a woman 
capable to endure hardships as well as a

human nature was the mother? it is

ways, through which I was guided by 
the gifts of fpirit, fortune, honefty, 
and virtue. Td a willing mind no- 
thing is difficult, human life being a 
mixture of good and evil ; it is hot 
enough to have fpirit to enterprise all, 
but we muft have alfo courage to fuf- 
ferall. 
Much more I would have faid in

Behaviour of Madam Cafardo on dijco- 
vering me to be a IVorrum. 
TH E perfon that interrupted u$ 
was one of the Prince's fervants, 
who told the Prince that Count Termes 
was in the anti-chamber, and defired 
the favour to fpeak with him : this cir- 
cumflance gave me great uneafinefs, as 
I knew not what effect hi$ prefencc 
might have on me; I might perhaps 
have been fo much miftrefs of my fell: as 
not to give him the Ieafl fign of my con- 
fufion, but the Count, not knowing 
what happened to me, and believing mc 
not to be known to my parents, might 
have been cafually furprifed in a falfi- 
ty, had curiofity induced them to aflc 
him if he knew me : in confequence of 
what had pafled between him and me, 
he would naturally have faid, no 5 and 
this would have been fufficient to hurt 
his reputation, which was now become 
dear to me as my own ; but, luckily 
for me, the Prince ordering the Count 
to be introduced, handed me into the 
Duchefc's apartment and drew the. cur- 
tain, fo that I could hear what was faid 
without being feen. 
The 
'< 59 ).., 
'The Count came in, and.affured the 
'Prince, that of the fugitive of Avignon 
he had no farther knowledge than that 
which was contained in the three let- 
ters, and that he had denied the receipt 
of them, becaufe he thought it incon- 
fiftent with the character of a mm of 
honour to do otherwife. Here the 
IMnce interrupted him, by faying, that 
he was fatisfied with what he had faid, 
without his adding any thing more ia 
his vindication $ aud returning to him 
his letters, he afked him, how long he 
lhould tarry at Verfailles ? the Count 
replied,that he intended to depart asfoon 
as conveniently he could for the army 
in Italy, but that his departure depend- 
ed upon fome particular affairs, nor did 
he know when they were to be fettled. 
I beg of you, faid the Prince, not to 
fet out until I have the pleafure of fee- 
ing you again : if I can do any thing 
to ferve you, command me ; for as I 
have given you fo much trouble, it will 
be the greater pleafure to me to make 
you amends. This kind reception to 
my lover, was to me an incredible con- 
folation ; becaufe as it is natural for our 
wilhes to keep pace with our inclinati- 
ons, I interpreted it in my own favour. 
As 
<6o) 
As foon as the Count was gone, the 
Prince called me to him* Well, laid 
he, has it not given you a pleafurje to 
fee a lover with whom you have, helci 
' £o clofc a correfpondence ? the time 
will come to render yon content ; now, 
aiot only me, but the.Diichefs, your 
mother, have juft motives to be cauti- 
ous that no one fliould know you are 
our child, for at court it is concluded, 
that the girl flown from Avignon, is 
daughter to the deceafed Dukej and 
you muft not deny it at prefent, b,ut thai 
the Duke wa?your real father,, l^ft you 
reveal a fecret which is known between 
four only, that is, us two* .Cafardo, 
and yourfelf j nor will your condu& in 
man's apparel be a dishonour to you, 
as it will be clear to ail that you are a 
woman, by your laying afide thefe 
cloaths, and dreffing in thofe of your 
own fex : but we muft ftill have fome 
confideration for Cafardo, who is par- 
taker of our fecret, and not irritate her 
with an affront, by expofing her repu- 
tation to the (lander of the malicious, 
- in taking from her a huiband by whom 
lhe is fuppofed to be made a mother ; 
the Duchefs likewife approved of this 
reflection of the Prince, and it was re- 
folved between us, that, to fecure their 
reputation,

( 61 ) 
reputation, I fliould pafs for the daugh- 
ter of the deceafed Duke, after I had 
difcovered myfelf to be a woman, and 
not to own myfelf for fuch until we 
had found fome means to preferve the 
reputation of my fuppofed wife. This 
project was reafonable, nor did it give 
me the leaft uneafincfs; the grand 
, thought that difturbed my mind, was 
to know how my parents refolved to 
proceed concerning my amour with 
Count Termes, and whether they were 
agreeable or contrary to my deiires ; I 
was fenfible, it is true, of the kind re- 
ception, they gave him that day, but, 
at die fame time I was troubled when I 
refle&ed on the rigour with which they 
had treated him, as foon as they knew 
of our correfpondence in Avignon: 
they were my parents, but they were 
grandees; and in people of this cha- 
racter, policy often gives law to the 
moft tender fentiments of nature : from 
thefirft day I beheld the light of this 
world, they had given me a great prob£ 
of their regarding pun&ilios, by oblig- 
ing me to keep fo referved, and this 
was fufficient to make me dread worfe 
for the future : befides this, I was un- 
eafy in my mind, not knowing how to 
proceed with the Counts I determined 
Vol, II. G however 
( 60 
liowerer not to mention it to him till I 
iirft knew in what manner they pro- 
pofed 'to difcover me to the court; I 
was already certain that he would not 
ieavq Paris without my notice, and 
thefe were the affairs which, as he told 
the Prince, deferred his journey to Ita- 
ly. With thefe and the like reflexions 
I paffed almoft the whole night without 
reft : the next morning Madam Cafar- 
do knocked at the door of my apart- 
ment, and acquainted my fervant that 
Ihe defired to fpeak with me; though 
I was ftill in my bed I was no ways a- 
larmed, as I did not in the leaft doubt 
i>ut that the Duchefs had informed her 
that I was the fugitive of Avignon : I 
therefore ordered Madam Cafardo to 
be introduced $ but 'for once I was out 
in my fuppofition, which occasioned a 
ridiculous (bene with Madam Cafordo, 
who, feeing me in bed, in a tranfport 
of love threw both her arms round my 
neck, then kifled me with fo much ar- 
dour that (he almoft fuffbcated me. I 
was ftill confirmed in my opinion 
that (he knew all about me, nor did I 
. make the leaft refiftance to hercareffes : 
this only ferved to heighten her amo- 
rous wiihes ; Now, faid (he, kfffing of 
J me, you crown my hopes, nor can I 
call

call you any longer ungratcifcL I 
dire&ly rofe up to diets myfelf ; but 
how was (he amazed when fhe found mo 
to be a woman like herfelf! Hiq turned 
pale, loft her fpeeeh> and looked: at rac 
with aftonifhment, andi had almoft 
fwooned away upon the bed : I affcbd 
her with furprize, what was the mat-* 
ter ? has not the Duchefs, faid I, told 
you that I am her daughter ? You 
daughter to the Duchefs ! replied fhe, 
with more aftoniihment than before, 
you no no more a man, but a woman ! 
you no more my hufband, but my mif* 
treft ! O God i what will become of 
me ? what of my reputation ! it was 
fecured enough with the fole name of 
being your confort : alas I this, this is 
the greatefi exfream of human misfor- 
tunes that can happen to a woman of 
credit : this ought to be the laft day of 
my life, finee I have loft my reputa^ 
tion ! . . . . how cruel have you been to 
keep me in the dark fo long ! have I 
then loved you to fuch a degree, thro* 
only believing you to be a man ? I do 
not reproach you with favours received 
at my hands, which have pafled unre* 
garded; but I reproach you for your 
infincerity 5 having gained from me fo 
much knowledge of your own birth, 
G 2 yoU 
(6 4 y 
2ou'have abufed me by making me 
tnguilh to no effe# ; and without re- 
compenfing me, in return, with the fe- 
icrets of. your heart. — She would have 
proceeded further had I not interrupt- 
ed her, by alluring her, that we thought 
more of her reputation than ihe ima- 
gined : the propofal of the Prince com- 
forted her a little, but lhe could not 
forget how lhehad loved me to no ef- 
fect i and this perhaps was the only J 
fault that lhe pardoned againft her will. j 
I related to her the moft material part ] 
of my adventures, and Ihewed to her i 
the letter lhe wrote to me when I was in 
the convent of Avignon, which I al- 
ways carefully preferved. Count Ter* 
mes was next the fubjeft of our dif- 
courfe; this was what I wifhed for, be- 
ing defirous.to difcover from her, what 
was the opinion of the Duchefs in re- 
gard to my correfpondence with the 
Count, and what I had to expeft ; and 
to my great concern, found that I had 
very little room to hope for the concur- 
rence of my parents in that affair : lhe 
would not tell me any thing for fa<ft, 
nor would lhe tell me all, for fear of 
making me uneafy : lhe protefted that 
in every thing lhe would efpoufe my 
caufe, and from that moment declared 
herfelf

tyr r df devoted to my intereft, flatter- 
^ herfelf, as (he frankly acknowledg- 
ed, that I being born a Princefs (hould 
\>e treated as fuch, and that (he ex- 
pected the honour to ferve me as (he 
had ferved my mother. I could not 
avoid giving her my promife, to which 
her affe&ion for me had already intitledi 
her, and laid me under an obligation 
to ferve her ; (he feemed much better 
fatisfied with my promife than I was 
with her method of proceeding ; our 
obje£s were quite different, and in eon- 
fequenee we could not agree weft in our 
dondu# t * becaufe I flncerely loved 
Count Termes, and my nuptials with 
him would render me happy; (he, 
who did not care the leaft about him, 
trufted her happinefs to fome better 
party, who, by making me great, 
might alfo enlarge her fortune.

Methods propofed tofave the Reputation 
of Madam Cafardo. 
BEfore that day waspafled, I $ook 
an opportunity to inform the 
Dutchefs, my mother, of what had 
patted between Madam Cafardo and 
me, which diverted her very much $ 
fhe knew the weaknefs of that Lady, 
nor could flie forbear to condemn it^ 
however, as flie was obligated to her, 
fhfi was under a neceffity to preferve 
her honour, which would be expofed 
to fcandal upon my being difcovered 
tp. the court, and proper means to pre- 
ferve it, were not eafily to be found. 
The Marquis of * * * *, nephew to 
the deceafed Duke, and by whom (he 
had been deluded, was the moft proper 
Eerfon to expedl a remedy from, but 
e was in the dark of what preceeded, 
and the affair was of fo delicate a na- 
ture, that it was not fafe to mention it 
lo him. 
The Prince let fome days pafs with- 
out coming to any refolution on this 
point, and I proceeded as ufual ; but 
the change of fcqne which was to take 
place 
( 67 ) . 
place in a lhort time, gave me fome 
apprehenfions, and the entire depen- 
dance I had upon my parents, depri- 
ved me almoft of my liberty. I was 
one day permitted for my amufement, to 
go in a coach to the fair of St. Ger- 
main, where, amongft other merchants, 
I faw Duli, with his portable lhop, and 
dire&Iy ordered my fervant to tell him, 
that at a certain hour he muft bring 
fome of his goods to my lodging, where 
there was a gentleman who wanted to 
purchafe. At the precife hour Duli 
came, loaded with merchandifes of va- 
rious kinds : When he faw me he was 
greatly confufed, and I, to carry on the 
joke, told him that it was not me that 
wanted him, but the Dutchefsof * *  *, 
who had orders from Rome to put him 
in prifon ; he knowing himfelf to be 
guilty, readily believed what I faid, 
and offered, if I would give him liberty 
to get out of the way, to make me a 
prefcnt of an hundred piftoles, and a 
fuit of the richeft cloaths he had. The 
propofition is good, faid I, your trade 
goes on well if you can afford to fpend 
fo much, rather than be fent back to 
your own country. Jiearken to me, 
perhaps what I am going to fay will be 
better for you : Give me the hundred 
piftoles 
( 68 ) 
piftoles you have proffered* and I wilt 
add two hundred more to thenl, and it 
fhall be fent to Madam Qalanti your 
wife, who will pay therewith the re- 
mainder of your debt*, andyouthen can 
return again to your own country* 
whftre your family will receive you with 
open arms. . Would heavens pfaafe to 
grant me this, replied Duii, before I 
die, I would firtciy part with all I have 
in the world, provided I could, wkh 
the fecuarky of my liberty, and life* 
ipend the remaiftder of iny days witk 
my dear wife and children. There is 
no danger of either, faid I* provided 
you are willing to retuifn. I then in- 
formed him that I had lodged in his 
wife's hoirfe at Rome, and that I had 
acquainted her with his being alive, and 
had alfo difpofed the Duehefs t o affift 
him, that he might return to his own 
oountty with fafety. The poor gentle- 
man, at thefe words, ihed tears of joy, 
and promifed to come to me at Ver- 
feilies* where I promifed to pre&nt him 
to the Duchcfe, and afterwards to ac- 
company him to Rome, to fettle his 
affairs. In the while I gave his wife no- 
tice, .telling her that (he might expe& 
her hufband in a Abort time. The next 
day I had anfwer from my kind hoft at 
Venice, 
- ( 69 ) 
Venice, concerning his waiting-maid * 
he told me he would come in perfpn to 
receive Rofaura, for whom he profefled 
a particular affe<5Uon, and that he would 
keep her from Venice till fuch time as 
the memory of her bad conduct was 
dropt. 
I communicated to Rofaura the con- 
tents of the letter, which ihe read with 
tears of joy, on feeing herfelf treated 
with fo much regard by a man whom 
flic had ufed with the higheft ingrati- 
tude. Thus, within the compafs of a 
few weeks, I had the fatisfaftion to re- 
ftore to a wife he* hufband, and to a 
mafter a fervant whom he regardedas his 
child; and I had reafon to rejoice that it 
wa$ in my power to be grateful to two 
perfons.who had each of them been fer- 
viceable to me in Italy, and to whom I 
might have recourfe in any misfortune 
whatfoever. To thofe who were my 
real friends, I ever took a fatisfa&iqprin 
being grateful; and in the choice of 
my friends I always made virtue my 
guide, for I held it as an eitabliihed rule 
of my conduft, that where there is no 
virtue there can be no friendihip, and 
that the union which is made by vice, 
intereft, and paffion, foondiflblves, nor 
does it finilh but with our ruin. In the 
mean 
(10) 
mean time the Prince had found out a 
method to preferve the reputation of 
Mkdam Gafardo, and this was to mar* 
ry her to Mr. Befone, giving out at the 
fame time that they had been married 
for fome years, but that their marriage 
was kept a fecret through fear of the 
deceafed Duke, who, being very paffi- 
onate, would have refented it much, 
becaufe Mr. Befone had refufed to mar- 
ry the daughter of one of his depen- 
dents, under pretence that he would 
always remain a bachelor ; this taken 
for truth, the remainder would readily 
be credited, by faying, that Madam 
Cafardo being with cfiild by Mr. Be- 
fone her hufltend, could' not confefs it 
for ffcar of expofing him to the Duke's 
anger, therefore begged that I would 
paft for her hufband till time would 
permit them to publiflfcthe truth. The 
moflr difficult point wis t<* perfuacte 
Mr. Befone to the match ; but he, by 
the favour of the Prince, expe&ed foon - 
to make his fortune, and with that 
view he confented to the defires of any 
parents; and Madam Cafardo being 
ufed to have hufbands that had no great 
affe&ion for her, and who treated her 
as b, wife only in outward appearance, 
the affair was fettled in a few days, aiwL 
their 
X TO 
their nuptials were published as if they 
had been celebrated fix years before; 
at the fame time it was publickly pro- 
claimed that the deceafed Duke was .my 
father, and that I was no longer Count 
flichard but Mifs D'Arville. ThepJau- 
iible appearance of thefe two extraor- 
dinary accidents were very favourable 
to Madam Cafardo : the transformation 
of my fex engroffed fo much the atten- 
tion of the public, that they entertained 
not the leaft doubt of the affair of Ma- 
dam Cafardo. At court I was principally 
the fubjeft of difcourfe, and they were 
continually repeating my adventures, 
praifing my fpirit, and placing me 
amongft the heroines of my fex ; 
there were but few who by their own 
account did not fufpeft me to be a wo- 
man, even the King confeffed to have 
admired me, and defired to fee me, 
laying that he would not confer his fa- 
vours in vain, but would replace them 
~by others more agreeable to my fex. 
Thefe encomiums flattered my vanity ; 
but all this while my parents never men- 
tioned to me the name of Count Ter- 
»ies, and this filence filled my heart 
with grief 5 from that day he had vifit- 
ed the Prince I had not feen him, and 
- therefore judged it proper to acquaint 
' *«/ him 
(70 
him by letter with what had happened 
to me, that he might not be uneafy 
or furprifed at the public talk of my be- 
ing a woman ; Duli, who often vifited 
me, was the perfon that carried my let- 
ter, and brought me the anfwer, in 
which the Count, with honour and Sin- 
cerity, trufted every thing to my pru- 
dence, and encouraged me by promis- 
ing to be faithful. The Duchefs every 
day detained me fome hours with her- 
felf, to hear from me the particulars 
of my adventures, and I always endea- 
voured to introduce in our difcoufe 
fomething concerning Count Termes, 
that I might know the fentiments of her 
heart ; I fpoke for the moft part in ge- 
neral terms of efteem and honour, but 
coming to the particular of marriage, 
ihe told me, that children in the choice 
of a partner for life, efpecially thofe of 
the nobility, ought to be guided more 
by policy than paffion. What confe- 
quences could I expert from thefe max- 
ims, that would not be forrowful and 
dreadful to me? while my parents were 
iilent pn that point, if my fear agi- 
tated me, ftill 1 flattered myfelf with 
fome hopes; but when they fpoke in 
that manner, I no longer doubted my 
fate. In comparifon of this I reputed 
my 
( 73 ) 
my paft misfortunes a felicity ; and al- 
though in Avignon the retirement of 
a cloyfter was irkfome to me, I was now 
almoft in a fituation to defire it ; and 
rather than be married againfi my in- 
clination, through motives of policy,, 
I would have ventured to deliver my-i 
felf from that danger by flight; nor had 
I lefs courage at this time than former- 
ly, but an a#ion of that fort would 
now have appeared criminal in the 
eyes of ail the world, becaufe another 
flight would not be juftified as the firft 
had been by my not knowing my parents.! 
With tears I lamented the unhappinefs 
of my fate, but I was confcious in my- 
felf that J had not deviated in my con- 
duct from the ftrift rules of virtue, 
nor by any criminal a#ion merited 
fuch ill fortune*, and I am fully con- 
vinced, that, to thofe who think as 
they ought, a reflexion of this fort 
will always afford fatisfa&ion.

I am prefented to the King infWoman's 
Drefs, and am fiat tend with the Hopes 
of try Nuptials with Cednt Termes. 
TH E day was now arrived in 
which the Duchefs was to pre- 
fect me to the King, and every thing 
was ready prepared that I ihould be 
prefented in woman's apparel : as the 
court in general endeavoured to outvie 
. each other in grandeur, Madam Ca- 
ftrdo, with two of the Duchefs's wait- 
ijig-maids, had the trouble to drefs me 
as was requifite for my appearance; and 
I muft lay for the glory of the men, 
that I left their cloaths with an incre- 
dible grief : foixie year* ago, theleaft 
of my thpughts was to drefs myfelf, 
Jbecaufe I could do it in a few minutes, 
and without affiftance ; but that day I 
was obliged to get out of my bed at 
fun-rife, and not move from the toilet 
till two o'clock, 
I well know that the looking-glafs is 
a great inticement to women to lofe 
their time, becaufe it ferves to feed 
their vanity ; but I did not find It any 
wa^s attractive to me, nor did I defire 
k 5 for in my manner of thinking, 
my 
x 
(75) 
my own vanity fervcd me for a conti* 
nual torment : the jiumber of jewels 
and flowers which they ufed to beauti- 
fy my face and drefs my hair, appear- 
ed to me more like bafenefs than pride, 
as it fhewed, that all our beauty de- 
pended upon ornament : the rich habit 
in which I was drefled, feemed to me 
a very great incumbrance ; nor could I 
underftand the ufe of a train of twenty 
yards more than was neceflary; nor of 
a robe that has ten yards of circum- 
ference and two of diameter. The 
time I fpent at my toilet was not loft, 
for it was moftly fpent in thefc and the 
like reflexions. While they were drelT- 
ing of me, it was their bufinefs to fet 
me off, to the beft advantage; but when 
drefled, it belonged to me to adapt my- 
felf to l^he manners becoming my fex, 
that I might not be laughed at ; the 
aftions of a man were fo natural to me, 
that I thought it would be impoffible to 
aft otherwife; drefled in a manner to 
me quite new and forgotten; I knew 
not where to keep my hands, or in what 
manner to demean myfclf, and it hap- 
pened more than once, that in offer- 
ing a falute, I raifed my hand to my 
head, thinking that I had my hat on : 
I was obliged to apply to the looking-" 
H 2 glafs 
C.7<5) 
glafs in all my aftions, that I might not 
appear ridiculous at court; andwhat un- 
eafinefs did this application coft me ! yet. 
it pleafed my vanity a little, for In that 
drefs I thought I looked moft amiable : 
if I ever enjoyed agreeably four or five 
Jiours together unmixed with forrotf , I 
believe it was thefe I fpent that morning 
in dreiEng myfelf. When I was adorned 
from head to foot, I went out of myroom, 
like a fhip new rigged out of the har  
bour,- to be prefented to the King by 
the Duchefs my mother, through a con- 
courfe of people on each fide gazing at 
and admiring me. ThcKing receiv'd me 
"with great affability, and amongft'other 
things told me, that having had courage 
to ittake two campaigns before I got a 
hufbarid, I had made a fortune fuitabjc 
for a Marshall :- I took this as a joke, 
but time will prove that it was not 
meant as fuch. This vifit being ended, 
I pafled the remainder of the day 
in receiving the vifits of my friends, 
and the relations of the Dufchefs mf 
mother, with thofe of the deceafed 
Duke, who paffed for nly father, 
amongft whom came the Princefs of

At the fight of, this affembly I know 
not what were the fentiments of mv t 
heart ; the movements of it were to 
confuted, turbulent, and violent, that 
I could not refleft properly on any 
thing ; my foul, full of the news givea 
me by Madam Cafardo, would yet 
hope that this was the moment appoint* J 
cd by heaven to compleat my felicity ; 
but the little dependence I had in my 
good fortune, made me apprehenfive 
of the worft. Mutual compliment! 
of civility being over, the Prince^ 
turning firft towards the Count and 
then towards me, My children, faidhe 
to us, for fuch I can call you becaufe 
I love you as a' father, I have called you 
both, to give you at the faijie time an 
equal teftimony of : my love. Thefe 
words were lufficient to make my heart 
leap, and my eyes fparkle with joy; I 
caft them modeftly upon the ground* 
after I had looked two or three times 
at the Count to let him know we were 
nigh being happy : his gravity was lit- 
tle different from mine » and although 
we had more motives to hope than to 
fear, yet we looked like two criminal* 
at the bar, waiting till our fentence of 
condemnation was read. Jn proof of 
my 
(8i ) 
my love, proceeded the Prince, I will 
make you content; Courit Termes has 
merited it, by that prudent and honou- 
rable regard he has had for Mifs D'Ar- 
ville ; and you, Mifs, have merited it, 
by that regard you have had to your 
honour in all your proceedings fince 
your birth, and to my perfon alfo : the 
reward I am going to propofe, is a 
marriage agreeable to the Duchefs and 
to me, and to the whole court, and will 
eftablifh your fortunes for ever. What 
fcould I defire more, to make me be- 
lieve that I was then arrived to the 
height of my felicity ? I lifted my eyes 
from the ground to fix them on Count 
Termes, and they met his which ex- 
prefled equal joy on his fide : I had 
almoft fallen on the chair that flood be- 
hind my back, unable to ftand upon 
my feet through excefiive joy ; the 
modeft and compofed behaviour of the 
Count, encouraged me to imitate him ; 
but I wifhed for the hour to be at li- 
berty, to enjoy the violent tranfports 
of nature. Your fubmiflion, your ho- 
nefty, and prudence, proceeded the 
Priiice, makes me hope that you will 
obey thefe my defires, and I fhall be 
pleafed that thefe nuptials are conclud-

From a beginning fo promifing, who 
would ever expe& fuch an unfortunate 
conclufion ? my tranfport of joy was 
fuddenly changed into the agony of 
death ; the tears ran from my eyes, for 
1 was not miftrefs enough of myfelf to 
check them * even the Count himfelf 
changed colour, but his courage was 
not daunted j the duty 1 owed to my 
parents commanded my filence, but he 
might freely vent his pafiion, and he 
ipoke in a manner which, if it did not 
free me from my grief, at leaft left me 
in a ftate not to be defperate* Your 
JHighnefs, replied he, does me an ho- 
nour fuperior to my merit, and I hope 
this lady will not be offended if i refufe 
to take her in this manner at firft fight, 
without giving her firft fome reafons 
which render me unworthy of her per- 
fon. Your reafons, proceeded the 
Prince, interrupting the Count, muft 
be reduced to one only, that is, you 
love Mifs D'Arville, but Mifs D'Ar- 
ville cannot be yours, and as long as I 
am alive ilie never fhalh She will not, 
, replied 
( «3) 
replied the Count, daringly, becaufe 
your Highnefs is her matter ; I am al* 
to matter of my own will, to aflure 
you, that if Mils D'Arville will not be 
^mine, neither will I be any others. 
Well, replied the Prince, fince it is fo, 
I have no other buftnefs with you. 
Here the Count mad * him a low bow, 
and giving me a look that penetrated to 
my foul, without faying more, de- 
parted 5 foon after I alfo was harftily 
bade to leave the Duchefs, and retired 
to my room to give vent to my grief, 
which I thought could not finifh but 
with my life. The predictions of Ma- 
dam Caf*rdo were now explained $ the 
tendernefs of my parents, and my own 
hopes, even my own heart, foretold 
the truth, when it perfuaded me not to 
difcover my fecret till firft I had fecur- 
ed my felicity : why was I not yet a 
fearful fugitive, wandering in mens 
cloaths? at leaft I fliould have no ojie to 
force my inclinations : what fignifies 
knowing the grandeur of mybirth, when 
that to me was a precipice, from which 
falling, I knew not how to rife again, 
becaufe my parents themfelves made 
my fall more dangerous ? ftould I, to 
be born great, abandon a lover, chofen 
by my own free will, given to me by 
my 
(84) 
my fufferingi : arid to me fifen more 
worthy than eyer by the undaunted- 
nefs with which he aflured me, in the 
face of my father, of his inviolable fi- 
delity ? It would have been better for 
me to be born in low fortune, fince 
grandeur is a flavery, and declares. it- 
felf an enemy to reafon, obliging: the- 
great to be ungrateful : to be grateful 
to Count Termes, muft I difobey my 
parents, darken my reputation; and 
expofe my honour to new dangers, and 
at the fame time reap noarevyardi but 
the difapprobation of the unreafonablc 
and ill-judging world ? it is better, faid 
I to myfelC to die with grief, fhan live 
d i (honoured and blameable j andamongft 
this confufion of afFe&ions, I knew not 
how to rcfolve. All my refle&ionjs fi-

iicient to apjpeafe the rage of a tyger ^

New Hopes t>f my Nuptials with Count 
Termes. 
IN the raoft critical circumftances of 
my life my heart was never daunt* 
ed, becaufe experience had taught mc # 
by fome means or other, to hope for a 
remedy ; but for what my father pro- 
posed I could find none, nor could I 
comprehend the meaning of my parents 
averfion to my nuptials with Count 
Termes ; and if Madam Cafardo could 
not inform me, to whom elfe could I 
have recourfe ? I paifed all that night 
in thefe and the like reflexions, with- 
out getting a moment's reft, and wait- 
ing with impatience for day-light that 
I might gain from her fome knowledge 
of this intricate affair : ihe loved me, 
and ihe knew my tendernefs for the 
Count, and I fuppofed her to be ac- 
quainted with all the private concerns, 
of my parents, as ihe l^ad been par- 
taker of the greateft, which was that of 
my birth. At break of day I got up, 
jrefolving to go to her that moment, but 
was prevented by her coming into my 
room : Be chearful, Mifs, be chearful* 
faid ihe, I have got good news for you, 
and expeft before night to have better. 
Vol. II. I At 
< *6 y 
At thefe words my grief vanifhed in an 
inftaat, and 1 flattered myfelf with the 
hopes that my parents had changed 
their opinion. Count Termes, added 
ihe, will this morning be declared a 
Brigadier; his promotion was appoint- 
ed laft nighty and the King in perfon 
wtti communicate it to him in a few 
hours : this advancement to him is' as 
hdn&utfabte as it was fudden and unex- 
pe&ed 5 I do not fay that he does riot 
merit it from the crown, but there are 
officers at court who have been in the 
kxtohy more campaigns than he, and 
therefore will look at him with envy 
for this promotion, for which he is in- 
debted to the Prince, your father; apd 
I r imagine, .by his making this intfereft 
fbr the Count, he refolves to give him 
to^ou for a hiifband : I know that at 
ffrft he had fome repugnance, but this 
iHtike? me judge that it proceeded from 
*he Couflt s inferiority to you in point 
of fortune : the King by preferring 
felm makes him your equal, land I hold 
for Certain, that before night it will bfc 
jpublkkly reported that you are intend- 
fcd r fbr him. Heaven grant it may bt 
&,- &id I, w my heart. The wards of 
Madam Cafardo appeared rery proba- 
ble, *nd I kmftediatdy remembered 
^ . the 
<«7) 
the word* fpoken to me by the Kiqgi 
which were, " that I ought 'to hare no- 
thing lefc than a Matrfhali for my hufr 
hand/* I was now convinced that hi* 
words carried a meaning with them, 
for there was but little diftance between 
the rank of a Brigadier and a Mar- 
shall. Neverthelefs 1 had feveral fcrii* 
pie & in ray mind which I could not 
cafily overcome : If my father, laid I, 
had an inclination to ferve the Count, 
why did he yefterday, in my pre fence, 
wajithimtoinarry Lady **, and on 
his denial mortify him fo much ? O 
Mifs, replied fhe, the reafon I can 
cafily tell j your father aims to make 
you great, the Marquis of *** is 
about purchafing a principality in Italy, 
which undoubtedly he will obtain * in 
confequence of this your father intend* 
ed, by making him your hoiband, to 
make you a Princefs : but he has now 
changed his opinion, or elfe he is un- 
willing to thwart your inclinati- 
ons ; and by promoting Count Termes 
defigns to render him worthy of your 
perfon, without which he never would 
confent to the match : he is you know 
at prefent only a cadet, noble indeed 
by birth, but not wealthy, and his 
eftate encumbered with the debts of 
1 2 his 
(88.) 
his father : thefe are things that ftrike 
at firft fight, and to underftand the in- 
tentions of the Prince there is no ocea- 
fion for any greaf policy. Madam 
Cafardo would have faid a great deal 
more, but 1 was already fufficiently in-' 
terefted in his favour to credit the truth 
of what ftie faid. I ^Ihali leave it to 
ihenl who are ferifible wn^t love is, to 
conceive with what impatience I attend- 
ed the event of that membyable day, 
full of the fweet ideas of a ^leafure I 
forefaw drawing nigh me; 'tis impoffi- 
ble to exprefs the agreeable fenfations 
of my Jaeart, when I reflected on the 
particular favour which the Count was 
to receive that morning from the King; 
I knew that the Count would prefem 
himfelf to the King either in his going 
Or coming from the chapel, and was 
ctefirous to be prefent at that juncture, 
but chofe to' be in private that I might 
not betray the movements of my heart* 
I ftudied for fome time whether there 
;was any place in the gallery from which 
imfeen I might obferve their proceed- 
ings, and luckily recolle&ed, that in 
the gallery which was near my apart- 
ment, there were fome windows, from 
which I could look into the ball which 
led tothe chapel*; this flratagem pleafed 
me 
( 9 9 > 
me greatly, but Happy would it Have 
been for me if I Jiad not been fo haity 
to put it in pra&ice, for I fliould not 
then have heard, to piy extreani an- 
guifh, my own condemnation.

Honours prefflered to him by the King, 
I Was not certain whether Count Tha- 
mes had received any^ notice con* 
cerning the honour he wa? to receive 1 
at the audience of the King that morru* 
ing, for from that day 1 had feen him 
in Janefon's room, in the Baftilc, I se- 
ver fpoke to him $ twice I faw him ill 
the prefence of my parents, but .fee- 
ing him then only added to my confi*- 
iion ' 9 and after the declaration made to 
him by my father, ^we dared not tp 
write to each other, there being 3 
ftriA guard ove* us both, and the ieaft 
correspondence would have beei* coo- 
ftrued a crime :, with this uncertainty 
in my foul, and with a book in my hanp, 
under pretence of reading, I went im- 
mediately from my room to the gallery 
bqforementioned 5 I here found a win- 
dow which opened to the anti-cham- 
ber, but which at this time was blockefl 
up on the inner fide by the tapeftry 
I 3 which 
( 9° > 
which adorned the hall ; in this I <lif- 
covered a fmall opening, thro* which I 
could fee and hear what patted in the 
Jiall, without being obferved by any 
one : judging this the raoft proper 
place, I waited in expe&atioit of what 
was to happen : Ifoonfixed my eyes 
upon the Count, who was furrounded 
by a multitude of friends who were 
congratulating him on his good for- 
tune; the matter, thought I, to my*- 
felf, is now manifeftly paft all doubt; 
Count Xermes is to be a Brigadier, 
and wiir then be my hulbancj ; if he 
had merited the refentment of iny fa- 
ther he would not have been diftinguifh- 
cd in this manner, and it is evident, 
that my unhappinefs proceeded from 
iny own filly apprehenfions. I was re- 
lieving in this manner when there 
arofe a fudden whifpering, which was 
followed immediately by a profound fi- 
lence, (a certain fign that the King was 
drawing nigh) at firft T thought the 
King looked all round for him, at leaft 
my love flattered me that he did * when 
he diftinguiftied him amongft the mul- 
titude, being dire&ed to him by my 
father, Sir, faid he, we have thought 
proper to do Juftice to your merits, by 
Rewarding your paft fervices j you are 
appointed 
( 90 
appointed a Brigadier in our army 
which is at prefent in Bohemia, for 
which place you muft depart as foon as 
poffible, your prefence being . neceflary 
there. Thefe words were to my heart 
fo many wounds ; . do they intend by 
this, laid I,* an 'honour to Count Ter- 
mes, or a chaftifement to our aflfe&i- 
on ? I then perceived why my father 
interefted himfeif in his promotion, 
which was to tear him from my heart 
by fending him from all France, and 
that to) conceal his" inhumanity he had 
artfully contrived, by advancing him 
him to that poft, to feparate us from 
each other : this was daubing with ho- 
ney the edge of that gilded cup out of 
which they gave me poifon to drink 5 
his diftance might be fatal to my love, 
becaufe he might forget me ; and my 
parents might with lefs difficulty force 
my inclinations. How many things 
pa(Ted in my mind at that time, for 
which I was fully perfuaded 'twould be 
impoffible to find a remedy ! Count 
Termes having accepted this poft, 
would be obliged to obey j and he, , 
obeying the King's orders, was loft to 
me for ever. This reflection alone was 
fufficient to ftrike me dead, but curi- 
ofity ftill induced me to fee how this 
difmal 
(** ) 
difmal tragedy was to end : Count Ter- 
mes feemed not to be in the leaft daunt- 
ed at the King's words, and this his 
refolution incrcafed my confufion* 
I thought that he was like the genera- 
lity of the men, and that his ambition 
prevailed over his love. Poor women I 
faid I, in my heart, we are the idols of 
thefe ungrateful men, yet, at the firft 
blaze of their good fortune, we fair the 
unpitied vi&ims of their ambition. 
With this fufpicion I did injuftice to a 
lover who had given me a thoufand 
proofs of his fidelity ; but where is 
that woman who is guided by reafon 
when fhe thinks herfelf treated with 
contempt? My King, replied Count 
Termes, with an undauntednefs that 
furprifed me; my King, you fee at 
your feet the moft unfortunate of your 
fubje&s, becaufe I dare not refufe the 
honour you do me, and ftill am under 
a neceffity not to accept it; the intereft 
of my family obliges me to implore 
from your Majefty a difmiflion, fo far 
am I from the power of accepting in 
your troops fuch an honourable pofl ; 
but as foon as my family affairs permit 
me, I will not fail to ferve your Ma- 
jefty to the laft drop of my blood; but 
muft now do violence to myfelf, and 
grant 
( 93 ) 
grant to others that glory which in ten 
campaigns I have made it my ftudy to 
merit. 
At this fpeech, little expe&ed by any 
perfon there, my father feemed to be 
vexed ; but the King anfwered him in 
obliging terms, faying, tliat in his in- 
tentions to ferve him, he would by 
no means be a prejudice to him, . and 
that he was entirely at liberty to ma- 
nage for the beft the affairs of his fa- 
mily ; but that at anytime, or upon 
any occafion hereafter, he fhould find 
him in the fame difpofitions to do him 
good, Diflblved in tears I retired to 
my apartment, faying to myfelf, what 
Jiave I feen ! what have I heard ! Count 
.Termes loves me to fuch excefs, as to 
give up the pofleffion of an immejife 
fortune, rather than abandon me ; but 
wretched me, what event can I expe& 
by feeing him ruined through my 
means ? I tremble with horror, even 
now, at the remembrance of thofe tu- 
mults which aro/e that day in my heart, 
the confufions of affe£Hon, compaflion, 
honour, love, and gratitude. The 
Count renounced his advancement, that 
he might not be feparated from me ; 
and what confolation did this undeniable 
proof of his tendernefs give me ? if 
my 
(94) 
toy parents fhould ftill rcrfifl not to let 
ttle have him, at leaft, thought I, he 
will be nigh me, his prefence will be 
fome comfort to me, and he himfelf 
will be a witnefs of my fidelity : this 
was the raving of my paffion, blinded 
by the Teal wiflies of my heart ; but it 
vaniflied like a dream when oppofed 
with the direflions of reafon : what fig- 
niffed the Count's being near me, when 
his prefence would ferve only for a 
continual torment to me > the fon of an 
illuftrious but reduced family, without 
wealth, without employ, without hope* 
what figure could he make in the 
world? and how could I flatter myfelf 
that he would ever be my hufband I 
his paflion for me has ruined him, and 
in.ftriving to convince me of his love, 
he has overthrown all the profpe£s of 
our nuptials ; and thofe very methods 
we have taken to infure our felicity, 
haftened the unhappinefs of us both. 
Notwithftanding that before his rcfufal 
of advancement I trembled with the 
apprehenfions of his accepting it, yet 
fo flrange were the flu&uations of my 
mind, that I now looked upon his de- 
nial as a ftep too dangerous, not to fay 
real madnefs i and I thought that if I 
had 
( 95) 
had been at hrs ears, I would have 
counfelled him againft it j and what 
would I not have then given to recall 
his words ! I fhould have been willing 
for him to go not only to Bohemia, but 
even to America, had he left me the 
hopes of being one day or other his 
wife. As much as I loved Count Ter- 
mes, I do not blufli to confefs, that in 
renouncing for my fake fuch an iliuftri- 
ous fortune, he did not aft like a man 
of fenfe, and I (hould have been more 
blameable than himfelf to juftify his 
indirect conduft ; he behaved wrong, 
and I likewife did wrong in approving 
i t at firft : it would have been better 
for us both, that he had not proceeded 
in that manner $ the wound was mor- 
tal, and beyond the power of a reme- 
dy; he Underftood it in a different 
light, and I was not at liberty to advife 
him otherwife. My parents ftill conti- 
nued to treat me with all the tokens of 
affeftion, but of him they did not 
mention one word ; and Madam Ca- 
fatdo confefled that (he could not gain 
the leaft light in this intricate affair. 
My marriage with the Marquis of 
* * * was foon after held for certain alt 
over the court, without one word more 
of it beiftg mentioned to, me ; this 
myfterious 
myfteribus filence encreafed the trouble 
of my foul, which was always in fear, 
not knowing what might be the event : 
in the interim a report prevailed that my 
mother, the Duchefs, was with child ; 
and it feemed to Madam Cafardo, and 
myfelf alfo, that the pregnancy of the 
Duehefs might better my condition, 
ihe not having any children by the 
Duke, her firft hufband, and not be- 
ing fure of having any by the Prince, 
beiiig io for advanced in age, ihe>- ltfofc- 
cd upon me as the only heir to h$r 
eftate, and principal fupporter of her, 
family $ Ihe knew by her own 'experi- 
ence, how difagreeable it was to be 
married for fole policy, and wiflied me 
to be married to my equal, but with- 
out letting the world know I was her 
child : the Marquifs of * * *, ihe 
thought more fuitable to me than 
Count Termes ; becaufe. being an Ita- 
lian, he could conduct me immediately 
to Italy, where no enquiry would be 
made about my birth: to remain in 
France with Count Termes, her repu- 
tation would be expofed to continual 
danger ; if ihe proved with child, all 
thefe things would change their effc£; 
and if it ihould be a boy, her affecti- 
ons and hopes would all center in him, 
and 
(97> 
and flie in confequence would permit 
me to marry as I pleafed j but neither 
fhe nor I apprehended the real caufe of 
my parents difapprobation of giving 
me to Count Terraes. 
CHAP. XV. 
Real Motives for which my Parents would 
< not give me in Marriage U Count Ter- 
mes. 
FROM all I have yet faid, no one 
will be able to guefs what were the 
motives that induced my parents not to 
confent to my nuptials _ with Count 
Termes : of this obfcurity I am not 
the fault, for I write my adventures in 
the order as they befel -me, and my felf 
was then puzzled to find out their rea- 
fons. Amongft an hundred things 
which came into my mind, each had 
its probability ; but after thinking 
whole nights and whole days, I knew 
no more than at firft \ and if my mo- 
ther had not explained it to me, I 
fhould never have found it out. 
She found me one day with a book 
in my hand, and ferioufly reflecting 
upon what I read ; fhe alked me, what 
book I was reading ? to which a fud- 
den thought came in my head, and I 
Vol. II. K anfwered 
ttifwered her, it was my ow:» a&vmi 
cures. How ! added the Duchefs, I 
never knew that your adventures were 
printed. So faying, fhe took the book 
out of my hand,, and .looking at it* 
found in the title page, The Daughter 
Married to her Diflike 4 fhe fmiled as 
fooii as flie fkw it, and returning it to 
me, Ah ! my child, faid ihe, comparing 
this book to yourfelf, you do wrong 
to me and offend yourfelf ; I know you 
have propofed the nuptials with Count 
Tennes, for the only end of your con- 
duct j but I afk you, if thefe nyptials 
will illuftrate your conduft, or cUiho* 
nour it ? remember that here you mar- 
ry a cadet, poor in fortune, who has 
renounced the honours he actually had 
and what he might expe& hereafter in 
the army: we confult your honour 
more than your fortune ; to be great, 
it is enough you are virtuous, but 
your virtue is not fufficient to make 
you appear honourable* the opinion of 
the world is guided by appearances; 
-ancj whatever you have done fince yotif 
flight from the convent of Avignon 
diftionours you much, becaufe the 
world fuppofes you* have done it for 
the fake of Count Tcrmes, and a thou- 
, . ■ fand 
( 99 > 
fend Tories art fpread about this affair 
that offend our glory, and your virtue: 
by marrying a peridii for whom they 
believe you have loft your honour, it 
will jufhfy the flander of the malicious, 
and blemifh your reputation for ever : 
this is the reafonfor which we have ap- 
pointed the Marquis of'*** to be 
your hufband, and if we had omitted 
to tell irou of it before, our motives 
proceeded from tendernefs : refleft, 
Mife, that honour alone makes us tru- 
ly noble i and that this might not be 
prejudiced in the foolifh opinion of the 
world, I facrifice to it the tendernefs of 
a mother, in fufferi'ng it to be believed 
that you are riot my daughter. Imi- 
tate my example, by facrlfteing alfo 
yourpaffion to your honour; and if 
though contrary to my inclination, I 
lofe the pleafure of owning you for 
my daughter, you Hkewife, by efpouf- 
ing for your honour the Marquis of 
* .* *, ought not to repute yourfelf 
married to your diflike. At this dif- 
courfij of my mother I was like one 
roufed from a dream; her maxims 
were not reafonable in all refpe&s, and 
I could readily have given a proper an- 
fwer, but the danger of my honour* 
which fhe painted as evident and una- 
K 2 voidable, 
( ioo ) 
voidable, called up immediately alhny 
refleftions; I aflced her, with an air of 
furprize, what the world could fay in 
regard to my love for Count Termes, 
that, for the fake of my reputation, I 
fhould be obliged to forget him, and 
not have him for a hufband ? What do 
you fay ? replied the Duchefs, nothing 
lefs furprifed than me, be not anxious 
to know it, for. it will terrify you. Cer- 
tainly, faid I, if I muft forget Count 
Termes, it is proper at leaft I fhould 
know the reafon why; and if you, Ma- 
43am, love me as your child, you will 
not conceal it from me. Tofatisfyyou, 
replied fhe, I will tell you, but give me 
your word not to be difturbed at it : 
The malicious have taken the liberty to 
fay, that Count Termes in honour is 
obliged to marry you; without my 
fpeaking more at large, are you fenfi- 
ble of the confequence of it ? this is 
not all ; for they fay, that it is no won- 
der the daughter ihould imitate the 
mother, who was with child of you be- 
fore lhe was married ; aikUthefe fcan- 
dalous infinuations are already in the 
mouths of the public ; the Marquis of 
B. C. nephew to the deceafed Duke, 
and your fuppofed coufin, has caufed 
this report to propagated by fome of 
. . his 
( ioi ) 
hi* emH&cies, in order to exclude you 
from any title to the Duke's eftate* and 
to make you pafs, in the opinion of 
all, f6r my child, and by this means 
diflionours both the daughter and the 
mother: this, Mifs, is not an imagi- 
nary invention, and you muff, for the 
future, lay afide the tendernefc of & 
lover : your nuptials with Count Ter-» 
mes would not be left fatal to your ho- 
nour than to mine ; the fchemss of thofe 
villainous wretches muft be counter- 
mined more with deeds than with words* 
neither will it be improper to let fom* 
months pafs before your marriage, as it 
would clearly manifeft your honefiy* 
and by your marriage with fome other* 
perfbn, it will appear, -that all your, 
luppofed paffion for Count Termes* 
and the reports which have been fpread 
concerning you, are only the effetfs of 
downright niafice. Recoiled yemrfeif* 
my dear child, and follow the advice of 
your affe&ionate parents ; you ought to 
regard my honour as much ?s I do 
yours, and by marrying the Marquis 
of * * *, you ought not to couni your- 
felf in the number of thofe gifts who 
are married to their diflikej nor can 
you do it without doing me an injury. 
With this the Duchefs left me, but I 
K 3 hardly 
C 102 > 
hardly knew where I was, fo great wa* 
my agitation and confufion: while I 
appeared in the perfonage of a man, L 
had always this thorn in my heart, and 
my honour, as clofely as I looked after 
it, I thought was never fecure ; fcan- 
dal and detraction generally aim their 
darts againft innocence, and whenever 
a woman is perfecuted by the malici- 
ous, you may reafonably conclude her 
to be virtuous : I was amazed to think 
that! the Marquis B. C. had fcanda- 
lized a perfon that never had in any 
manner injured him; I trembled left 
Count Termes fhould by fome means, 
underftand who was the caufe of this. 
Infamy, and refent it as an offence to 
his reputation and love, two points ex- 
treamly fufceptibl^ of injuries in a man 
Of! honour, and might refolve on 
Ibme defpcrate fevenge, which would 
^ompleat his- own ruin, and difcredit 
me. With thefe difmal apprehenfions 
fri my mind,' I would gladly have ad- 
Vifed him to fufFer and be filent, that 
worfe might not happen; but the 
Duchefs ordered me not to give him 
the leaft hint of it, and, according to 
my maxims, a mother ought to be 
obeyed; my fituation therefore was de- 
plorable and difficult. Being perfuad- 
ed 
(.103)/ 
ed hy fo many reafons,.I thought it 
very proper to give over all hopes 
of my nuptials with Count Tennes; t 
but could I have courage to pierce his 
heart, by giving myfelf to another ?. 
or could I attempt to preferve myfelf 
for him at thecoft of difobeying my pa-! 
rents, and facrificing my honour? I 
thought both thefe things equally im- 
poflible in my circumftances, but one 
or the other I was obliged to embrace. 
The Duchefs after this beginning did 
not ceafe to teize me every day on that, 
head 5 fhe alfo refpeiting Count Termes 
in her heart, would have been grieved 
to have feen him ruined and unhappy, 
upon my account, and begged that I 
would advife him to .marry the Mar- 
chioriefs M. and promife him, that fhe 
would make intereft at court that he 
might get his poft again. . Thus was I 
obliged to aft a moft afflicting 'part 
in a fcene which, though only repre- 
fented in a tragedy, would have coft 
me a river of tears j what trouble muft ( 
it then give me, when compelled to re- 
prefent it in perfon ? I know not whe- 
ther the obedience of a child, or the 
tendernefs of a lover, determined mq 
to comply with my mother : I promif- 
cd to obey her -, but witfr how many 
fighs, 
( io4 ) 
fighs and tears did I eonfent to her in- 
treaties, fo contrary to the inclipatidn 
of my Amorous heart! to be 'rayfelf 
the bearer of this cruel meffage was a 
fevere trials from which nothing left 
could deliver me than that principle of 
virtue which rendered me fuperiortq alt 
dangers, efpecialiy thofe which con- 
cerned my honour. We refolved be- 
tween us 1 , that the next day, when* 
Count Termes was to pay me a vifit, I 
ihould embrace that opportunity to 
gerfuade him, with all my authority* 
to perform what my honour, the ho- 
nour of my mother, and his own for- 
tune required. Tilt that fatal hour ar- 
rived, it is impoffible to conceive the 
agitation and grief under which I la- 
boured! the ftep I was compelled to 
npake, be the confequenee what it would, 
t?ecaufe my reputation was in danger, 
and my word was pafs'd to the Duchefs : 
I could not know what the Count would 
refolve in confequenee of my propofat, 
neither did I know for certain the true 
fentiments of my own heart upon this 
intricate point $ my love defired he 
lhould not obey, my virtue defired he 
ihould be obedient $ but whatever it 
was to be, in what manner could I re- 
gulate my conduit after he had refolv- 
ed 
< 105 ) , 
ed to his liking ? in-. every fiippofitipft, 
gratitude commanded me to love him* 
but how could I 1 ove him, if I gave 
my hand to another hufband without 
his meriting fuch proof of my ingrati- 
tude ? In my fituation I could deter- 
mine no otherwife than to petition hcfr 
love in behalf of my rival, and pre- 
ferve myfelf for him by not engaging 
in wedlock, with any other : to this rer. 
folution I was prompted not only by 
my affe&ion for him, but alio by my 
honour ; for I reflected that, in fpite 
of all calumny, the world would he 
clearly convinced of the fincerity of 
my heart, when they faw me carry my^ 
offering with me to the grave : tjiis 
principle being, planted, in my br^alf^ 
to deliver me from the importunity^! 
my parents, who.ftill wanted m& i# 
marry; therefore, to preferve myfelf 
faithful to Count Termes, to contra*

was no better ftep for me to , teke, 
than, by withdrawing myfelf intirejy

to retire and end my days in a cloyflter *

fify Refohtion to retire inta a Cloyfter, 
and my Awfs Opinion quite contrary t* 
mine; 
NO W am I in my thoughts ar- 
rived at a place to which fix years 
before I intended never to return. When 
I proje&cd that memorable flight from 
ii»y retirement of Avignon, who would 
have told me, that I ihould one day or , 
other wilh for that folitude and quiet 
which I willingly quitted with indigna- 
tion and horror, and became a wan- 
derer rather than live in fubje&ion. I 
th^ijtaofced upon my unknown paretntf 
to be cruel in the higheft degree, be- 
c^\jife they wanted to confine me in a 
ftoyfter* and now, had they even 
confcated to confine me in one for life, 
I fhould have thought it a token of 
their affe&ion, and the moft prudent 
method to preferve my honour unful- 
liedy and my future life contented and 
happy. Thus do our inclinations and 
tempers vary according to the variati- 
on of circumftances, times, and places, 
and every fenfible perfon will readily 
agree, that a material change in mat- 
ters 
( ro7 ) 
ters of importanc, will fully juftify a 
change in our refolutions. 
When I defpifed the retirement of a 
cloyfter, and now when I even earnest- 
ly defired it, I am convinced in my 
own mind, to have done each time no 
more than what was fight ; my cir- 
cumftances then gave me reafon to de«. 
fire my liberty, but my prefent cir± 
cumftances laid me under a neceffity 
to facrifice my liberty to iny honour 
and quiet, which we. ought to regard 
beyond every other felicity in this mi- 
ferable life : tljey certainly are moft 
prudent who regulate with reafon * but 
circumftances changing, the fame prin- 
ciples of reafon will not always be found 
confident with prudence. 
Being fully determined in my heart 
to end my life in a cloyfter, in cafe I 
could not otherwife render myfdf con- 
tent, I though t at leaft to be lefs uneafy 
in my mind, and I did not doubt but 
my parents would confent to this my 
defire, knowing this to have been their 
intention from the day of my birth.: 
the moft difficult matter which now 
remained, was to fpeak to Count Ter- 
mes.; I employed the remainder of that 
day,, and the following night, in dif- 
poling myfelf for that fliarp trial, ftu- 
dying 
( io* ) 
dying with myfelf even the words with 
which. I was to perfuade him. 
The next morning, every perfon 
that came into my room with any riief- 
fage, made me fhudder with fear, 
dreading that fetal hour in which I 
was to fee the Count : amongft the reft 
Madam Cafardo came to me towards 
twelve o'clock 5' Do you know, faid 
fhe, who is coming to pay you ft vifit ! 
Count Termes, faid I very teadily, bfe- 
caufe his arrival ran fo much in; my 
mind. No, added ihe, it is 1 your 
aunt, the Princefs B. C. After to the 
deceafed Duke that partes for your fa- 
ther'. What can this importunate wo- 
man want with me? faid I, and why 
does fhe come to trouble me this morn- 
ing ? I do not know, replied Madam 
Cafardo ; and was going to proceed 
farther, but the Princefs came in the 
while, and lhe was obliged to retire. 
This was the fecond vifit I received 
from my aunt fince lhe knew that I 
was daughter to her brother; and to 
give my readers a proper idea of this 
extraordinary perfonage, it is neceflary 
that I fhould lay before them a fhort 
/ketch of her character and perfon : Be 
pleafed then to obferve, that the Prin- 
cefs B. C. was a woman fmall in fea- 
ture,

than my waift, and might be called a 
jdwarf; (he had not a limb in her bo- 
dy* nor a feature in her face, that.jvas 
not deformed and diftorted, her nofe

be feen in her eyes, and though (he had 
an itching to be always fpeaking, her 
words feldom; had any foundation : in 
all her anions fhe aflumed an air of 
.importance, and few were the things 
of any confequence in the world that 
fhe did not pretend to have a perfeft 
knowledge of: fhe dreiied like her 
equals in the, richeft cloaths,. but in a 
faihion peculiar to herfelf; ihe gene- 
rally was dreffed in a hoop of a mod 
enormous fize, and the Iapets of her 
cap when fhe curtfied touched the 
ground ; her gown was magnificent, 
and adorned with jewels fuitable to her 
fituation in life, though at the fame 
time her fhift and lace ruffles were as 
dirty as if they had been dipt in the 
mire. Notwithftanding her figure was 
not new to me, yet I found it a diffi- 
cult matter to refrain from laughing;

( no )

fc^rs flowing from our eyes, we re- 
mained a confiderable time looking at 
each other without fpeakijng a word; I 
at length took courage to break the

told him, that the Marquis B. C. \£a$ 
the principal author of this fcahdal : f at

fired to fee the Count Richard; I could

really a grief, for I came with the 
greateft defire to embrace you; but 
finding you thus transformed, my de- 
fire increafed to excefs, and I imift

kiffing your hand : confider what a 
mortification this muft be to a Venetian 
heart, naturally amorous and tender* 
His vivacity would have diverted rile 
extreamly, if my fituation had not 
been fo wretched ; we talked fome 
time about indifferent affairs ; but to 
conclude with Count Termes concern- 
ed me more than any thing befides : 
the prefence of Mr. N.N» was no ways 
Vol. II. M difa- 
( 132 ,) 
dHagreeable to me, beqaufe I knew 
bim to be a man of prudence and ex- 
perience, and capable to aflift us in our 
circumftances by his wholefome advice: 
I therefore gave him a fhort relation 
of the -affair, and rc-aflumed the dif- 
courfe about my propofal with the 
Count; but we were again interrupted 
by another vifitor whom neither of us 
in the leaft expe&ed ; this was our par- 
ticular friend Mn D'Arcore, who pre- 
fented huufelf to me, fmiling,. and 
faying, Can you deny, Mifs, that un- 
der thofe cloaths there is npt at prefent 
Count Richard? for though you con- 
cealed it from me before, well I knew 
-that under thofe of Count Richard was 
cdhcealed Mifs D' Arville : my candour 
with you merited the recompence of 
« more fincerity at your hands ; but in 
^regard to the Count, my friend^ I for- 
Vgive you all, provided you will conti- 
- nue to grant me the honour of being 
your fervant. 
In return for thefe obliging exprefii- 
ons, I was conftrained to repeat feveral 
things already mentioned* and I ad- 
mired the honour of Mr. D'Arcore, 
who never gave me the leaft reafon to 
fufped that he was privy to my fecret. 
Thus I found, to my great confolation, 
affembled together in my room, the 
beft 
( **3 ) 
fceft friends I had in the world, and 
who each of them earncftly joined in 
wifliing me happy : I again related tQ 
them my melancholy fituation, and beg- 
ged them from their friendihip toaffift 
me with their advice. But my circum- 
flances appeared to every one very crL- . 
ticalj and no one would counfel me to 
the retirement of a cloyfter, though 
they confeffed there could not be a 
more virtuous expedient; they alfo 
jhrofFered, not only to me but to Count 
Termes alfo, the ufe of their houfesat 
Lyons and Venice, with all they were 
worth in the world : concerning the 
Count's nuptials with the Lady Mar- 
chionefs, they approved of my oon- 
duft, but believed it unnecessary; they 
faid that it was his duty to agree* to 
thofe terms, and it was my doty to 
my mother to defire it of him. Thus 
by the plurality of votes I obtained my 
requeft, and Count Termes gave me 
his word, though with cxtream gfrief, 
that on receiving my orders he would 
be difpofed to obey me. On this our 
meeting, which had lafted above three 
hours, broke up; and I remained, I 
will not fay more content, but in lefs 
anguifh of mind: for in thegreateft, 
misfortunes I am convinced it is always 
a confutation to have done our dutv.

Myfterious Meaning of my Mother^ and 
fome Hints given me by Jane/on of 
the Perfons who had defamd my 
CbaraBer. 
THE Duchefs, my mother, re* 
turned towards night, and tho* 
fatigued with her journey, flie could 
not go to bed without knowing from. 
me the event of that day ; when I told 
her that I had obeyed her orders, and 
that the Count would efpoufe the Lady 
Maichionefs at my firft notice, i faw 
by be? countenance that (he was great- 
ly ptea&d, nor did ihe omit to beftow 
the highest encomiums on my virtue : 
She told me, that by an a&ion fo mag- 
nanimous, I had proved myfelf to be 
Tier child; that I fhould triumph over 
my malicious enemies, and that fooner 
or later I fhould be revenged of them 
all ; but I obferved that her joy was 
confiderably abated, when I added, 
that fince Count Termes had done fo 
much for toy fake, I alfo in honour 
was obliged to lay a reftraiht upon my~ 
{elf, in return to his compliance with 
. my 
( r2 5 ) 
my requeft, by retiring, for the re- 
mainder of my life, into a monaftery* 
She did not feem either fatisfied or dif- 
pleaied at my words ; but ihe was too 
old at court not to know how to diflem-' 
ble her fentiments with dexterity, and 
Ihe attended to my difcourfe without 
anfwering one word, or giving the leaft 
<ign of furprize. I continued to lay 
before her all the reafons which autho- 
rifed my refolution, and added, that 
fuch si ftep would alone vindicate my 
innocence to the cenforious world* 
When I had faid every thing that I 
thought proper in defence of my con- , 
du& in fuch a proceeding, ihe anfwer- 
ed me ferioufly , that my refclution was 
much to be commended, but that it was 
not the only one to be embraced in my 
circumftances,and fheadvifedme* before 
I executed it, to think a little better a- 
bout it j Jthat Ihe would not promife to 
confent to^ nor declare entirely agakift 
it, becaufe it did not depend upon her 
only, but on the Prince, my father, and 
perhaps on the event of her being with 
child. At thefe words Ihe left me 3 but 
this was enough to confirm in me the 
juft foundation of Madam Cafardo's o- 
pinion, that my parents would be lefs 
rigorous cdncerning my marriage, if 
M5 the 
( "6 ) 
the Duchefs fliould chance to have a 
lawful heir to the eftate. 
Notwithstanding thefe flattering prof* 
pe&s, I could not pafs my days in tran- 
quillity, nor enjoy one peaceable 
night ; the fole thought of lofing 
Count Termes, and of feeing him in 
the arms of another, rendered them 
painful and fevere. To fweeten, in 
tome meafure, the bitternefs, I thought 
it neceffary to hafken my retirement in- 
to my charming folitude, and toxhufe 
it in fome place diftant from France, 
that I might be afar off from thefe ob- 
jects which principally contributed to 
difturb my quiet!; and of all the cities 
of Europe I could not find a place bet- 
ter adapted for my purpofe than the 
city of Venice -, there I was fure to 
have a good friend, who would be to 
me more like a father, than an acquain- 
tance. There none knew of my mif- 
fortunes, nor Ihould I hear the morti- 
fying news of what happened in Francfe 
to Count Termes, to my prejudice and 
unfpeakable torment. 
My fpirits being filled with thefe 
fweet ideas, I figured to myfelf a hap- 
py Hate of life for the future, ' but was 
foon called back from thefe pleafing re- 
flexions, likeone jouzed from a dream 5 
the 
("7) 
the horror of my imminent misfortune, 
and the thought of dividing myfelf 
for ever from a man fo dear to me, and 
for his virtue fo worthy of my love, re- 
quired a refolution fuperior to mine, 
and even threatened me with the lofs of 
my life. After ftruggling fo long with 
thefe tumiiltuous disorders of my mind, 
how could I do otherwife than to enter- 
tain an utter abhorrence againft thofe 
who were the caufe of it y but whom 
could I accufe, whenl myfclfwas theprin- 
cipal caufe of my trouble ? If I had not 
gone roving about the world a ftranger, 
and in a ftrange drefs, I fhould not have  
given reafon to the malicious to attack 
my honour; but what had I done to 
be difhonour^d in this manner ? and 
who were the villains'that put fo bad a 
conftruftion on my moft virtuous in- 
tentions, and defamed me without e- 
ven knowing of me ? This was to me a 
myftery that difturbed me not a little, 
and occupied every day a good part of 
my reflexions. The Marquis B. C. 
was a wretch, whofe black foul was 
deftitute of every principle of honour $ 
all that happened to me on his account, 
when the Duke was living, was enough 
to make me know him for a vile wretch ; 
but in this attempt to fcandaiize me 
over 
( "8 ) 
over all France, I rould not believe 
him to be without accomplices ; for, 
as to himfelf, he was toa well known by 
the generality of people, to gain credit 
for any thing he afferted ; I likewife 
knew that the Marquifs B. C. had not 
the art to contrive a plot, which was 
executed fo cunningly as to anfwer the 
propofed end, and injure both my re- 
putation and my love, unlefs it was fug- 
gefted to him by fome other perfon who 
was an enemy to me, and gloried in 
this method of feeking revenge. In 
fearching out the original caufe of fuch 
private injuries, I feldom found myfeif 
in the wrong ; and even on this occafi* 
on I was not far from judging rightly. 
My father one day fent mq notice, that 
there was with him an acquaintance of 
mine, who defired to fee me, and that 
in a little time he would fend him to my 
apartment. I had not much leifure to 
refle<5t who this could be, for almoft in 
that moment appeared Janefon, my old 
learned acquaintance in the Baftile, and 
to whom I was in many refpe&s obli- 
gated. My father had informed him 
who I was before he left his apartment* 
and he came kneeling at every ftep, and 
gave me the title of highnefs at every 
third word* Soonaftenny interview with 
Count 
'( * 2 9 ) 
Count Termes in the Baftile, Janefon 
was fet at liberty by the means of the 
the Prince, my father ; and he told me 
that with this lucky accident, there 
came another ftill better : I alked him 
what it was, and he told me with a 
fmile, that his wife died a few days be- 
fore he came cut. Of this he would 
have talked feme hours, but I being 
defirous of difcourfing about other mat- 
ters, had the curioiity to aik him what 
important affair had feperated him 
from his books, and dragged him to 
Verfailies ; he replied that he came to 
implore the proteftion of the Prince, 
that he might have juftice done him. 
Your highnefs faid he to me, in a 
high ftile, mixing with it fome Greek 
,and Latin proverbs, of which tfuiew' 
not the meaning, your highnefs alrea- 
dy knows that I %am obliged to follbfcr 
the profeflion of a writer; that is to 
fay, I am born to work all my life, and 
die miferabte; If you remember that 
comedy, of which I ihewed you fome 
fcenes in the Baftile, and which meri- 
ted your approbation, your highnefs 
will pleafe to know, that that very co 
medy was to make my fortune, but i~ 
is now upon the point of being my ruin 
I ihewed it to fome of the a&ors be* 
longin" 
( *?o ) 
longing to the company of the King* 
comedians, and they approved of it lb 
well that they refolved to reprefent it. 
They afked me what value I put upon it ; 
to make an agreement was no difficult 
matter,' becaufe, like- the reft of my 
profeffion, I wanted the pence.' The 
coinedy received a general applaufe, and 
this gave me courage to venture fur- 
ther ; for that company I have worked 
four months, day and night, in which 
time I have produced eight comedies, 
by -which they have gained an immenfe 
fum of money; but becaufe the Iaft 
was not received with fuch applaufe as 
the others,, they refufe to pay me what 
they owe me, as if the labour of a 
man's brains was to be bought by trial, 
liketjie blade of a fword, or the barrel 
of a mufket. Fbr this reafon, Mifs^ 
I came to implore the protection of the 
Prince, your father, that I might have 
juftice done to me. I have to do with 
three perfons, whom, for ijheir moft 
extraordinary villanies, I may call the 
race of Lucifer, and to verify the old 
proverb, that the Devil helps bis own, 
they alTo do not want for prote&ion, 
for they have applied to the Marquifs 
of B. C. who has the dire&ion of the 
theatres, and he muft have promifed 
them 
( x 3 i ) 
them his afjiftance, for they now re- 
fufe to pay me with more impudence 
than even Amongft them there is the 
unworthy wretch called Tartar, who 
has been banifhed twice from France, 
and again reftored to the thratre, oa 
account of his /kill in buffoonery : u- 
nited with him, there are two other vil- 
lains, one of whom is 'called Albevit, 
and the other Nimar, both flrangers in 
the profeffion, having embraced it be- 
caufe they did not know how to live o- 
therwife. Jancfon would have pro- 
ceeded further, but at the name of 
Tartar, and Albevit, I interrupted 
him, becaufe I reputed myfelf likewife 
embroiled with them. Tartar, after 
jvhat had happened in Italy, had more 
reafon to hate me than he had the firft 
time at Verfailles, Albevit was the vil- 
lain from whofe afms I took the wo- 
man belonging to my friend at Venice, 
and perhaps for fo doing he did not 
forgive me ever aft«r ; their dependance 
on the Marquifs B, C. made me imme- 
diately fuppofe them tp be the authors 
of the fcandalous falfities which were 
fpread in Paris and at Verfailles, about 
me. I enquired of Janefon whether' 
he had heard any others of that compa- 
ny mention xny name j he anfwered 
^that 
'( *3* ) 
that he had heard me fpoken of by an 
adrefs, but could not tell me any thing 
more particular, I aflced him througfl 
mere curiofity, the name of that a&- 
refs, and found it to be MUs Gianet- 
ton, my antient confidant, not long 
returned from Italy, and who had* tin 
gaged with that company to fing b&- 
tween the a#s, according to the cuftom 
of France. This, gave me reafon to 
believe that I ihould eafily find out the 
remainder. I deiired janefon to folate 
her. in *»y name, and to tell her that. t 
defircd to fee her at Verfailles ; I affu^. 
red him alfo that 1 would fpeak, in his' 
favour to my father, to have juftice 
doug him ; but before he would leave 
rnc;I f* jconftrained to hear him for a 
go&d:&*lf hour exclaim againft the un- 
h^pp^ricf? of the poetic profeffion. 
'WJietfefgr his complaints were reafona- 
bl^ or not, I dare not take upon me ta 
affirm, but, according to my maxim, 
whpaver.conne&s himfelf with people 
of a»bad character, has no right to 
Complain of ill ufage, or at leaft de- 
fervps but little companion, and from 
company of that fort they are wifeft

MlfsGianetton had no (boner recei- 
ved my imitation by the hands 
of my friend janefon, than Ihc prepa- 
red to pay me a vifit, and in the fbace 
of two days arrived at Verfailles. Her 
regard for me was fo great, that, with- 
out paying the Jeaft refpeA to the dif- 
ferent circumftances of my paft, and 
prefect iituation in life, cither in the 
character of Count Richard, or that 
erf Mifc D'Arville, ihc clung about my 
neck, and embraced me over and over 
again with all the tendernefs of a fin- 
cere friend : to find jewels incorporat- 
ed with bafe and common metal, is in 
accident which but feldom occurs ; ne- 
vertheless when it {o happens, the bafe- 
nefs of the metal ought not to depreci- 
ate the value of thofe jewels, and I am 
forry to fay, that a fincere heart is fa 
rarely to be found, even in thofe of 
high rank, that when we find it in a 
plebeian, we fhould be unjuft if weo-

Vol, I!* N contrary 
contrary to thenilps of the ftri&eft vir- 
tue. When Mift Giarietton had thu$ 
affe&ionately expreffed ^hfcr fatisfa&ioi* 
at feeing me, and given me a long de- 
tail of her own adventures, we fell into 
difcourfe about the company of come- 
dians with whom ihe was engaged, and 
I found from fome hints which fhe 
cfropt," that Tartar, Albevit, and Ni- 
mar, made it their ftudy to flur my re- 
putation, and to propagate the mpfl: 
malicious and envious falfehood^ con- 
cerning me, the very thoughts of

itie Ihudder with horror. You will not

their greateft pleafure is to call an odi- 
vm'tipon the faireft reputations, to 
bring them, by that means, more upon

dSl, nor do they biuih when convifted 
of th$ moft notorious falfities : they 
will

will one day make a devil of a faint, and 
the next day a faint of a devil : I do 
aot wonder, Mifs, that thefe wretches 
are unable to fhake off the filthinefs of 
that mire from which they arofe, as it 
would be unnatural to expe& a good 
fmell from the filth of a dunghill ; but 
I am furprifed to fee gentlemen of ranlc

countenance them in their villainies, to 
the great dishonour of his reputation $ 
welcome to his table, and fafe under 
his prote&ion, they fport with the

truth of this, I need only take notice 
of the fhameful ufage which poor J^*\

and his bad fuccefs with his laft comedy 
was entirely owing to their incapacity to 
reprefent it in a proper manner ; they 
however alledge it to be the fault of the 
writer, and keep from him that proper* 
ty which lie has all the reafon in the 
N 2 world 
( * 36 > 
^orld to demand; Mifs Gfianneton 
4p»ke fo much to the purpofe, that I 
was fully convinced it muft have been 
thefe wretches who had thus cruelly 
endeavoured to wound my reputation, 
but I was amazed to think how they got 
credit in the world, neither could I tell 
how to baffle their dark fchemes agatnft 
me; I imagined that it was well known 
to my parents, and if they did not 
think proper to refent it, it mightbe 
owing to their prudence, therefore m 
me it would be highly unbecoming to 
inake any ftir about it, and according- 
ly refoived to wait the event of time, 
'arid rely upon that all-wife Being who 
is the powerful and certain prote&or erf 
injured virtue. In order to make fbrae

that I would ufe my beft endeavours to

like, and though, it is true, I had no- 
thing of my own to beftow upon her, 
I made no "doubt but that Mr. D'Ar-

wouW take a pleafure, from their owrf 
incomes*

word on. an occa fieri fo commendable, 
and what effect thefe my indentions had 
will be feen hereafter; for my part, 
whatever I faw and heard ferved only 
to increafe my inclination for a folitary 
life ; In what a world do we live ! fai4 
I to myfelf, and what jpleafure can wjs 
take in our converfation with mankind* 
when daily experience convinces us that 
we ought to look upon the generality 
of them as our moft bitter enemies! 
out honour, our fortune, and even our 
life, hangs fufpended in the air by a 
thread, when it is in the power of eve* 
ry malicious detractor to wound our 
reputation : what avails it to be virtu- 
ous, when by vice this day virtue is 
overcome ? or what profit is it tp be 
innocent, when lyes gain a preference 
to trutk, and flander is ftamped upon 
the faireft characters ? Bkfled is that 
folitude to which envy is a ftranger , 
and how definable are the wails of a 
convent, which', though they confine 
lis, defend us from calumny and re- 
proach ! With thefe reflexions I con- 
tinued to encourage myfelf for that 
great ftep which I believed not to be 
afar off, and 4 which I thought fo ne- 
ceflary for me \ yet, when I reflected 
N 3 on 
< *3» ) 
on my love for Count Termgs, I thought 
it almoft in^flible. la the mean 
while his nuptials with the Lady Mar- 
chionefs were held for certain, aad he 
had the liberty to fee me whenever he 
pleated, fo much did my parents truft 
to his honour and to my word; but to 
fee him too often was to me more tor- 
ment than pleafure, becaufe the fight 
pf him rekindled my love, and made 
me lament the neceffity I was in to lofe 
him. Before the day drew nigh of his 
nuptials with my rival, I wifhed lo be 
put of liis fight in my proposed retire* 
ment* but if I intreated my mother to 
permit jne, fhe, for her part, begged 
of xn$ pot to take fo precipitate a re-

M*Wg remained for me but affii&ion,

£aroe often to fee x»e; his vifits were 
^within the limits of common civility,

k afforded me feme fetisfa&ion to £nd 
that every glimpfc of virtue ahdreafon 
was not yet baniflied from among the 
great. Almoft every other woman would 
have hated his lifter as hertival, but I 
thought her adorable, and moft worthy 
of the furrender which I was going to 
make to her of a perfon as dear to me 
as life itfelf. 
When even fhe as well as myfelf had 
paflionately loved Count Termes, how 
could I make a crime of that love, in 
her which I made an honour in my- 
felf: 
( r 4 2 >

to love> is not in our breafls, becaufe 
the piffions of bur foul are not at our 
ownxiifpofel, though they ought to de- 
pend uponreafon to render them blame- 
left; i I Ihquld have had reafon to hate 
Lady M. if fhe had attempted by ar- 
tifice to take my lover from me - r but 
when lhe accepted him from my hands 
as -a voluntary refignation, of whom 
couoid I, complain ? nor was it more 
than whit 1 would have done my felf : ic 
is^tru*,. I confefs, that I envied hen 
.condiTioa, beeaufe to be wife to Count 
TermesI reputed her happy $ and con- 
ficfcring this to be a felicity which I at 
firft had defigned for my felf, her me- 
mory and her prefence could not but 
torment ine, though I ftill continued to 
love -her ; this was my opinion, nor could 
I think otherwife, even when that fatal 
day arrived on which the Lady M. was 
to marry Count Termes,' and banifh 
with hi* nuptials all my hopes of hap- 
pinefi. When my mother acquainted 
■ % . me 
t Hi 3 
me that the following day was ddllneti 
for the nuptials of Count Termcs witl* 
Lady M. and perfuaded me to dtfpofe 
myfelf for attending that great folem* 
nity, what did I not do, what did I n«t 
fay, that' fhe might permit, me to leaye- 
Terfailles for fome days, not to be pare* 
fent at a marriage which pierced- rajt 
very foul ; but all was in vain, becaufe- 
my abfence would have been a fign of 
my weaknefs, and would prejudice my 
reputation by giving thofe villains more 
room to fpeak againft me ; I will not 
fay that fhe was unreafonable in her 
rcqueft, but Ihe defired that I might 
affift in perfon at that ceremony, and 
appear with the reft of the nobility at 
the entertainment that was to be made 
on that occafion, and ihe added more* ^ 
over that it was abfolutely neceffary*^ 
Either the Duchefs my mother was a-'* 
woman fuperior to the weaknefs of her 
fex, or elfe fhe muft havefuppofed me 
capable of a refoiution which even flie 
herfelf was not. miftrefs of. 'Tis im* 
poflible to paint the agonies of my mind ■ 
at that time: my virtue had almoft 
abandoned me in thofe difficult cir- 
cumftances j I ran more than once to 
my wardrobe in which hung the mens 
cloaths I formerly wore, with intent to 
drefs 
( M4 ) ^ 
tlrefe nryfelf anew, and with the Tavour 
of that fame night make another flight, 
I know not what fcrious refie&ions 
kept me from that perilous attempt, 
becaufe my tumultuous paffions were at 
that time Wind to the light of reafon ; 
I flopped however a little to perufe a 
billet which I received about twelve 
o'clock from Count Termes, *nd which 
was wrote in this tenor : 
" Mils, 
I am unable to come in pcrfon toac- 
qtfiint youyvith what I Ought to inform 
you of, to convince you of my fincere 
aiTeftion for you :' fome hours yet re-# 
inain which are fuffif^ent to make us 
tefs unhappy : difpofe yourfelf as you  
think beft, for in your hands is my 
will, and yours only is wanting, to . 
abandon fudddenly, in the approach- 
ing night, my intended fpoufe, the 
court, and all France : wherever I go, at 
leaft I fhail be all yours ; and before you 
refolve, remember that without you I 
cannot live." 
This billet was enough to encreafe 
my torment, and drive me into a new 
abyfs of confufion ; oppofing to each 
other the nuptials of Count Termes

the Marquis deferved death long be- 
fore, and what other end could he ex- 
pert from his wicked proceedings ? 
every one pretended that they had fore^ v 
told' it more than, once, and the yery  
wretches that aflifted him in his wicked; 
fchemes. either through fear of offend-

thought of his death, becaufe they 
-were very cautious in concealing from 
my eyes every fentiment of their fouls, 
which was not regulated by the maxims 
of honour, , 
In talking to me of the fa&, tjiey ' 
praifed the courage of Count Termes,' 
but wiihed that he had a#ed with a Jitr ' 
tie more prudence. They were pleated 
to r fte, i: with the blood of the Marqtiis/

and

deprived himfelf of ever feeing me a-

cdLine more than all others, and gave 
njS no fniall uneafinefs ; ,the only fatifr 
faftion which I enjoyed was in knowing 
Count Termes to be fecure from the Ht 
gour of the law, but did nQt know in 
what place he refided, nor did 1 knpw 
in what ftate his wound was, or.whei 
tj>er he .was. well provided with,neeefla-

f^m^Jiewsof the affair, and,.ia4&i q$ 
btout mid-day, I was informed of . his; 
being in the Duchefs's apartment, and 
that in a ftiort time he would wait upo^ 
me. So defirous was I of feeing him*, 
that, till he came, every moment fe^iii* 
ecUo me an hour. I did not wait long 
before he arrived, and, at presenting 
himfelf to me, Mifs, faid he, you , and, 
I may fhake hands, for the fraendihip 
of Count Termes is equally fataj.tp ali* 
wWwiffa him well ; he has lulled * ^V

and I amaccufed for it $ I was inhishooft 
to get his wound dreffed, and the 
fiards, by miftake, took me for htm. 
protdied not to have merited fuch 
treatment, yet they conduced me to 
prifoo, and it is well for me that I am 
xuiiverfally known at Verfailles, or elfe 
perhaps I fhould have been baniihed or 
put to death for it. He then informed 
me of every particular that had hap- 
pened, and {hewed me a billet from 
the County which he received two hours 
Jaefore, in which he mentioned the 
place of his refuge, and defired that 
Mr. D'Arcore would make it his bufi- 
*iefs to inform me of every thing, He 
told me alfo what the Duchefs, my mo- 
ther, had faid on this affair 5 the fenti- 
>nents, faid he, of theT)uchefs fill mc 
with good hopes, (he having talked to 
me about Count Termes, with fuch e- 
fieem for his courage, as gives me reafon 
to believe that flie thinks herfelf obli- 
gated to hirp ; lhe even aflted me if the 
Count was not in want of money, and 
would have given me an hundred pi- 
Holes to have conveyed to him fecretly, 
without letting him know that it came 
from her hands; but, in his name, I 
thanked her for the generous offer, and 
told her that Count Termes wanted for 
nothing,

nothing, for that 1 Iraki given -Mm -five

We are fatisfied, Mifs, faid jfanefon, 
that your requeft is very reafonable, 
therefore I have not the leaft difficulty 
in putting you to a trial which none 
would be capable to undergo with pa-

prefenting it to me,, read it Mils with- 
out fretting at the contents, becaufe a

merited my attention, I had therefore 
proje&ed a match between them, which 
might be the making of their fortune, 
arid io my prefence, without more hc- 
iitation, it was concluded : Being bound 
to provide for their mantalnance, I had 
already fpoke to Mr. D'Arcore tp pro- 
cure fome employ for Janefon, and he 
Jiad defired me, when I fhould next fee 
Janefon, to fend him to him, that they

MR. D'Arcore returned next week 
to Verfailles, and after com- 
forting me with the good news of Count 
Termes* better health, which* mended 
apace, he ftiewed me a billet which he 
received the day before, and which held 
him in fome fufpence, becaufe he did 
not know how to anfwer it till he had 
firft commitnicated it to me to know my 
fentiments j he came from Paris ex-* 
0^3 ffcffly 
( 174 5 
preflty for this purpofe^andthebiltetiiu 
queftion faid as follows : 
" Dear friend, 
" The grcateft favour that can 
come to me from ^ou, js that of being 
treated with fincerity : in a few (Jay? I 
fliall be perfectly cured ; but what fig- 
nifies my life and health, if I lo£e alt 
hopes of my dear Mifs D'Arville. Ufe 
all the means in your power to difcover 
iphat is to become of her. If fhe is noC 
to be mine, I will at leaft have the plea- 
fure of adding to the death of the Mar* 
quis B. C. that of Tartar, Albevit, and 
Nimar, tocompleat, with their blood, 
hers and my juft revenge. If I muft 
depart banifhed from all France, I will 
at leaft leave an example that will teach : 
others how to refpeft innocence. If; 
you are my friend, you muft deter* 
name my perplexity upon this point* 
as to me, there is but little wanting to 
<: ompleatmy deiign. 
Adieu/' . 
The billet threw me into the greateft 
confufion : No, faid I, immediately . 
to Mr. D'Arcore, I will not have him 
commit this outrage, and I hope he 
will obey me, unlefs he has loft all re- 
gard 
gardformy perfon and. quiet: I can* 
not promiie to be his, becaufe I am not 
at my own difpofal; but I can fafely 
fwear, that if I am not his, I fliall ne* 
ver beanothers : and this ought, to be 
fufficient to make him lay afide tliefe 
barbarous ideas, and induce him to 
give me the confolation of feeing him 
happy in the World, if I cannot have 
that of being his wife : tell him, in my 
naipe, to leave to heaven the care of 
puniihing thofe villains, for we have 
no right to require mens lives, though 
they are ever fo wicked, their wicked- 
uefs will, in the end, be their own ex- 
ecutioner ; and by their carrying it to 
excels, they will, at laft, meet with the 
puniihment infli&ed by the laws of 
their country : let them live; and let 
him think of getting cured, and of 
obtaining the King's pardon* and ftill 
continue to love me, for I will preferve 
my oath even at the coft of my life, 
Mr. D'Arcore was pleated to fee my 
maxims agreeable to his own and con- 
fiftent with reafon, and promifed tQ tell 
Count Termes all that I had faid; then 
took his leave -with intent to fee me 
again the week following. 
The billet remained in myhar^s ; 
foi* after I had read it I put it carefefly 
into 
( i?6> . 
into my pocket, and Mr. D'Arcore ei- 
ther forgot it, or did not care to afk it 
of me again : this negligence coft me 
many tears; but fo great was my con- 
fufion on the reading of it, that I did 
not then know what I did. In the mean 
time my mother advanced faft in her 
pregnancy, and on this depended the 
permiffion I defired to" retire into a 
cloyfter ; neither, the Duchefs or the 
Prince had fpoken to me any more 
about that head, nor did I mention it 
to her, becaufe the face of things be- 
ing changed, I waited to fee how Count 
Termes' affairs would end ; and my 
mind was more at eafe, becaufe there 
wks another alliance on foot between 
the Lady M. and the Baron of R; 
which in a few weeks was not only pro- 
pofed but celebrated : her nuptials drew 
from my heart a dart which had pierc- 
ed it a long while^ and removed one 
obftacle to my felicity; and if another 
marriage which was talked of, between 
the Marquis of M. her brother, and 
th* fitter of the Baron R. beforementi- 
oned, had likewife taken place, it 
would have added greatly to my fatif- 
fadHon. Notwithftanding the Duchefs 
my mother had been fo long filent with 
me upon this point, (lie one day gave 
me 
( *77 ) 
me motives to renew the memory of 
thofe inclinations which made me figh 
far the quiet of a monaftery ; not that 
I had chofen a retirement on account 
pf the nuptials of Count Termes with 
Lady M. it was a refolution fuggefted 
to me by prudence, honour, and love : 
in whatsoever manner my mother un- 
<Jerftood it, Child, faid lhe to me, I 
plainly fee that you want to give the 
world an example of your amorous fi- 
delity ; I have not in the world any 
uxors children, and if I ihould have 
pother hereafter, it might diminifh 
my grief in being deprived of you, but 
would nevertheless make me very unea* 
fy ; and to "be plain with you, I can- 
apt refolve to confent to your marriage 
with Count Termes, his circumftance* 
^.t prefent render it almoft impoffifc>le, 
and you. paffing for daughter to the 
Puke, my firft hulband, would make 
a bad figure in the eyes of the world, 
by accepting in marriage a perfon that 
killed your coufin $ notwkhftanding 
this, who knows? with time we may 
fee ftrange alterations; nor would it be 
a- matter of wonder to me to fee this 
alfo: the neceflity to,which you are re- 
duced, either to marry the Count, or 
to retire into a cloyfter, are both equal - 
- l y 
(i 7 8) 
ly painful to me; not to tell you that 
they are both impoffible, but, of the 
two, I would rather fee you a nun than 
a wife. 
Well, Madam, replied I, throwing 
myfelf at my mother's feet, and em- 
bracing her knees, what you have to 
refolve, refolve now, dear mother, 
and diminifh my affli&ion; if I am not 
to be the wife of Count Termes, I ihall 
never be wife to another, I have vowed 
it to him, and I vow it to yourfelf ; and 
you can, if you pteafe, take from me 
this miserable life, but you can never 
force me to perjure myfelf : I have the 
courage to convert this neceffity of my 
circumftances into an a& of voluntary 
virtue : if you expeft from me an heir 
to your family, undeceive yourfelf; the. 
happy event of your prefent fituation, 
will, I hope, make you the more rea- 
dily comply to my reafonable defires ; 
dread, Madam, the difappointment of 
your own hopes, if you oppofe mine, 
and ufe me with violence : not expouf- 
ing Count Termes, I will obey you as 
a child ought; but if you deny me 
the grant of a cloyfter, to oblige me 
to marry another, you will not treat 
me as your child; nor will I move from 
your feet till you refolve me : do, dear 
mother ! 
( »79 ) 
mother! 1 conjure you by thefe moft 
bitter tears, with which I bathe your 
hands, to determine my fate : what a 
barbarous pleafure would yours be, by 
not granting my requeft, to fee me die 
before your eyes with grief! what will 
the ftep-mothers do, when our own mo- 
thers a<ft with fuch cruelty ? or what 
might I expe<ft, had I been daughter to 
the Duke, a hufband fo much hated by 
you,- when you treat in this manner 
the daughter of the Prince of * * * *, 
the firft and laft objed of your tender- 
nefs ? I would have proceeded further, 
fo many were the tender fentimentsfug* 
gefted to me by my paffionate heart ; 
but was interrupted by my mother, 
raifing me from the ground, I will fa- 
{Ufy you, faid fhe, and from this mo- 
ment I promife you that you are at li- 
berty, when you pleafe, to retire into 
a cloyfter : do not call me cruel for 
this.; I have been alfo in your cirCum- 
ftances, yet I ftill loved the Prince more 
than myfelf, and facrificed my perfon 
to the Duke becaufe prudence would 
have it fo ; nor can it be doubted, that 
in. fo doing I merited the bleffing of. 
heaven, which in time found means to 
reward my love : my example ought 
to give y oii courage to wait alfo with .

wiflies*' but asyott'&re determined^ by 
this hafty ftep, to ctrt off bath ycmf 
own and my hopes, you way depend 
upon it that I ihall not oppofe it ; but 
if you fhould hereafter have rcafon to 
repent it, remember that yoa/ cart 
Wamenoone butyourfelf. Wkhfthefe 
words the Duchefs left me * but noN 
withftanding the impreffion which Jra? 
difepurfe made on my foul, I was not 
at all reconciled to the notion of giv- 
ing my hand in marriage through mm 
live* of mere policy, in hopes q{ meet- 
ing with another more to my &ti*fe&k)n 
after his death ; I thought this entirely 
contrary not only to the*maxin|s & 
reafon, but even to the right of nafciK*! 
how wi-eohed muft be Che life <&£ it>bAi 
linhappy woman, whofe fole preyfjM&Sfc 
of content depends upon the i death ttf 
her hufband ? this would be verifying 
the vufgar proverb, that women count 
but two days of felicity in their whole 
life, which are, that in which they<ati& 
ntttried, and that in which their hus- 
band dies. My refolution being fixed; 
I determined to go into a cloyfter to 
prefervc myfelf faithful to Count Te*^ 
me$; and having obtained my mothetf* 
permiffion, I thought, from that mo- 
* -fluent 
( 181 ) 
ment \ I had lefs reafon to repine at the 
feverity of my deftiny : this was the 
principal ofcjeft of my thoughts, I con- 
tinued to love Count Termes, but with 
a firm refolution not to fee him any 
more ; with the hopes that this fepara- 
tion would contribute, in the end, to fix 
in me an efteem *for him, fincere and 
lading, and which might be rather a 
pleafure than pain to myfelf.

by them both, and having heard of the 
robbery twp days after they left Paris, 
th?y had him taken up upon fufpicion, 
a£d that by his confufion he prefendy 
Moved himfelf guilty; that Count 
Terines had in his hands all the jewels 
and money, and therefore, defired me 
to take this opportunity to employ my 
iotereift in his favour. 
This news gave me greater pleafure 
than any circumftance that could pof- 
£bly have happened : I began to think 
in what manner it would be of fervice 
to Count Termes, and after being ad- 
vifed by the Duchefs my mother, I 
went direflly to pay the Princeis a 
yifit, whp no fooner faw me but (he 
rail to. meet me. ,j)ear niece, faid ihe 
injariediately, have you brought me any

felf  v . ♦ . What do you fay, niece, of 
thefe chairs ? are they not more com- 
modious than yours ? well ; but what 
news have you got ? in which manner 
have you got it fo foon ? — Madam, 
faid I, joking, it was enough when 
the pojft-man knew it was for you, to 
make him go like the wind to accom- 
plish your defires : what will you give 
me, if in the term of ten days I can re- 
turn you all your jewels and money, 
without even the lots of twenty piftoles? 
What lhali I give you ? replied fhe, 
with an incredible joy, I will give you 
whatever you defire : — but wherte is 
the thief i in whofe hands are the jew- 
els and money ? I will difpatch a perfon 
immediately to get them; and whoever 
will return them fliall be entitled to all 
my protection. He that is to return it 
to you, faid I, is Count Termcs ; all 
your things are in his hands, and I have 
in. this letter the certainty of it.

would be agreeable to her ; but that 
(he being agreeable to it, they were 
content, and glad to find her fo well 
fatisfied therewith; and before that 
meeting was broke tip, my nuptial* 
with Count Termes were firmly agreed 
to by all the parties prefenu Imagine 
then my fatisfa&ion, when I iawjayr 
felf, after fo many ftonns, at the mouth, 
of the harbour, and fo nigh (artpking 
the 
( 201 ) 
the fruit of my fidelity : but I did not 
refreft that Count Termes was yet aifar 
bff, that I was not yet his wife, that on 
human affairs there is no dependence, 
and that fome unfortunate accident 
inight yet be fufficient to break the 
faugh on my lips, and turn. my joy in- 
to tears. Mr, N. N. was all this while 
at Paris, arid was on the point of re- 
turning to Venice,; but firft came to 
take leave of me, and renew his gene- 
rous offers : I enquired about Rofaura, 
tils "waiting-maid, to know whether h,e 
intended to take her with him to Ve- 
nice ? he anfwered me, that her bro- 
ther, who had gained a fortune in the 
army, being arrived at Paris, he ; in- 
tended to rid himfelf of her 'by leaving 
her in his care, and who had an inten- 
tion to marry her to a man of his own 
acquaintance : I have made her, faid 
he, a prefent of two hundred piftoles 
for her jointure, but fhall think np 
more of her ; if I fhould carry her back 
to "my houfe I could never after depend 
on her behaviour, for having once 
fallen, fhe may eafily be drawn into a 
fedohd falfe ftep which fhe may never be 
able to repair : in the little time I have 
Carried at Paris, I have obferv^d 'her 
carriage with attention, and I ?ee'ho 
( 202 ) | 
hopes of bringing her into prudent re* | 
foliations : I do not know, even by fight, 
him that feduced her in Venice; here 
he is called by the name of Albevit* ' 
but there he went under a different 
name, ahdl haveftrong motives to ber | 
lieve that flie has yet fome connexion | 
with him : however, flie is nothing more 
to me ; I have left her in the care of 
her brother, whom V have acquainted 
with every thing, and ihe cannot be j 
angry with any one but herfelf. ; 
He aCted with fenfe; but I was great- I 
ly vexed that a girl, in the bloom of 
"her youth, fhould proceed in that man- 
ner for want of ferious reflections : I 
had not feen her for fome time, having 
always invented fome excufe to avoid 
receiving her difagreeable vifits, thro* 
fear that they would redound but little 
to my honour : the event fufficiently 
proved that my conduct in that refpeCt 
t was right, and that the fufpicions of 
Mr, N. N. concerning her connection 
with the unworthy Albevit were too 
.true, and appeared in fo fcandalous a 
light, that her brother, a man of fenfe 
and honour, was involvecl on that ac- I 
count in a icene of bloodflied, which

upon, was exactly four days, and 
foon after Mr. N. ]tf .  departed, 
froiu Verfailles on his return to Ve- 
nice, a Comedy was a&ed at Verfailles, 
in which the principal performers were 
Tartar and Albevit, who, according to 
their jefting talents, were heard with 
approbation: Nimar, who was the 
third of Lucifer's aififtants, had no 
fixed employ in that company, becaufe * 
he wanted the ability for it, but render- 
ed himfeif neceffary to the others by 
his oeconomy and care in promoting 
their advantage : their particular pre- 
rogatives were to be great pratlers, 
great travellers, and head-firong to ex- 
CcU; daring all things, and biulhing 
at nothing. Between thefe three, rho' 
they were all of one model, that is, three 
villains, there was continual riot, in 
fuch manner that they were obliged fe- 
veral times to be filenced by the guards ; 
that fame night that the Princeft B. C. 
I had been talking to me, they came to 
blows upon the ftage about fome affairs 
between themfelves, and it grew to fuch 
. a height that it would have ran to greater 
lengths, had they not been prevented 
by theinterpofitioh of fome people in

TH E ftafi of that night was foiled 
ganr, and the company fo nume- 
rous, that what with the Cro#d and the 
totfc of dancings 1 was utterly unable 
to indulge thofe thoughts whicn merit- 
ed all my attention. After walking up 
ifid down a long time, admiriilg the 
magnificence, I fretired to another room 
te> efojoy the freih iair, and found, hi 
rhat place three tfr four people mafqued* 
*ho withdrew for the fame ptirpofe; 
Ottebf 'them was dttfled in a ptdiai 
cfraiTg£-eo!our domino*, and cotif t*bu£ 
ty'madt* tooth for me fo fit on* the corah 1 
<8i vtftifch himfelf was ftated: after pre* 
fenting me with fome excellent fweet- 
riieats, he fell into difcourfe with me. 
When we don't know with whom we 
are talking, we ought to be prudent 
and cautious in what we fay : he afked 
me, if I liked dancing as much as he 
$d himfelf f to which I anfwered, Sir, 
your mind I do not know, nor ought 
the fehcy of "one perfon to be a law for 
thatt of '<ttKers : 1, for my pan, do not 
iind 
-find dancing agreeable to my manner 
of thinking; I do not know for what 
reafci* I fhoiild torment hiy limbs : with 
movements abfblutely unnatural* for 
-fhe fake of mere diverfion, : and pre- 
fume to explain, by ridiculous ftep^and 
-ft range poftures, the internal agttation&p£ 
the foul, when we can explain them wfrh 
our tongues given us for that purpofe 5 ; 
to prove the abfurdity of -this amufe- 
jiient, it will be fufficifcnt, whilp you 
are attentive to any "dance whatsoever, 
to flop your ears iu fuch liiajMKjr ai }b 
ihut out the harmony of the., m\mt 
which accompanies it, and the dancers 
ivill feem like fo many mad people, who 
ftiove and know not for what': 'tis

ftjufic is that which renders tto? daiii:jc :

make it ridiculous. We are in a feafon 
now in which mufic is in great repute^ 
and, as they think, to,add to its charms* 
they join with it fo many objects of 
buffoonery; 1 would have fpoke more 
upon this fubjeft but he interrupted 
me, faying, This is philofophifing- on

JOur Journtyfrom Paris to Milan, ivbere, 
by a humourous Accident I dij cover my 
Huflaxd's Jealoufy. 
I Am almoft at the conclufion of ttfy 
adventures, but am not at that ©f 
my troubles, becaufe I had yet one 
misfortune to encounter with, which, 
without doubt, was the greateft of all : 
by the force of patience, perfections, 
and tears, I had at length attained 
-to repute myfelf happy in the arms' 6f 
(Sl fpoufe to me fo dear, and who fettled 
in me alone all his contentednefs $ not- 
withstanding this I did not e^peA to be 
always consented, for upon the happi- 
liefs of this world I had but little de- 
pendence ; and in the moft flattering 
c ire um fiances of my fortune, I had al- 
ways a dread of difappointment fixed 
in my heart. With all thefe my max- 
ims, the late danger of my dear fpoufe 
was an accident fo entirely unforefeen, 
'that it rendered me inconfolabie : that 
letter being examined by fkilful people, 
with proper precaution againft any bad 
confequence, contained nothing worth 
notice, and the character was unknown ;

j$^9$rwho opened Lt, was well known 
to every one that faw Count Termes that 
. May in the gallery : we could not be cer- 
tain from whence it came, but were all 
.of opinion that it muft be from ibme 
relation of the Marquis B. C to revenge 
* his death by bafe treachery. The cir- 
cumftances of the people concerned in 
this plot would not permit us to make 
it public through fear of irritating 
them : a prudent diffimuktion contri- 
butes greatly to . their confufiori and 
^vexation ; for to the envious and mali- 
> cious, there is not a greater pufii%- 
ment than that which accrues to them 
from their own difappointed malice?: 
; treachery when timely difcovered, r4- 
tprts upon the aggreffors, and tnfii&s 
niore forrow upon the contrivers of ir, 
J.than it <bes upon thoie who fuffered it 
without damage. It is enough that it 
Ogives us fome opportunity to difcover 
the traitor, or at leaft puts us upQii ow 
guard, though even without knowing 
him. This was the principal objeft of 
my attention ; the life of my hufband 
was to me a point of too great confer

flffeet quiet of a private fortune. . Our 
journey could not be very expeditious, 
as we carried with us a retinue of eight 
people, who had been for many years 
in the fervice of my mother, and well 
known by her to be faithful in their 
trufts. Faffing by Lyons, Mr. D'Ar- 
tore, our beloved friend, infifted on 
our flaying a few days at his houfe, and 
entertained us elegautly, as ufual. De- 
parting from Lyons we tarried- a few 
days at Turin, where the royal nuptir 
nh were at that time celebrated with 
the greateft magnificence, . From Tu- 
rin we paflfed to Milan, where Count 
Termes had obtained Tome lands which 
By right were his property. In this ci<- 
ty both myfelf and my hufband had 
many friends, and the kindneis which

Count Termes kept me rcferved, or 
> with any rigour deprived me of my li- 
berty, obferved my fteps, ordifturbed 
my conversion with any reproaches ; 
he was too wife to fall into fuch a weak- 
nefs, and had too much efteem for my 
virtue to difcredit it in the face of tfcp 
urorld with his jealous fufpicions. A 
hufband puts his own honour in doubt 
when he fhews too much concern, and 
«wry one will take the freedom to put 
their own conftfu&ion& upon the a&L- 
ons of a married woman, when they 
fee the hufband examine and obferve her 
with too much attention. The jealoufy 
*rf {fount Termes was confined withifj 
his heart ; nothing was to be feen by 
hk behaviour but a certain uncommon 
fednefe which prevailed over his natural 
liftAy temper, of which 1 fhould neVer 
have found oat the caufe if my eye* 
had not! been opened by a very hu** 
rttourous accident. Being in the fum- 
tter feafon, I fell afleep one day aftei\ 
dinner upon a chair, and flept fo found 
that any perfon might have come into 
my room without my either feeing ot 
heating theitij when I awaked, I found 
upon my bureau, which flood clofe by 
me, a bitliet; directed to me, but I did: 
not

*fiot f kno\tf the hand-writing, though I 
thought to have feen it before $ I calleSi 
My maid to know who had laid it therd, 
-or from whence it came; lhe informed 
me that ihe had received it from ano- 
ther of the fcrvants : I ordered her to 
go and enquire who fent it, becaufe the 
-fa& at Verfailles had taught me never 
-to open a billet until I firft knew from 
; whence it cafne ; fhe returned, and told 
me, that it was brought by a fervant 
belonging- to the Marquis P. S. I 'then 
:read it, and found it to this tenor : 
/. f* Madam, 
' If this day after dinner, in your go*- 
' ing to take the air, you would 'conde- 
scend to give yourfelf the trouble to call 
: at the lign of the Golden Eagle, you 
will anticipate me the pleafu re of em- 
bracing you, for I carfhot procure it (if 
imyfelf till to-morrow^ as I lhall tell 
you in perfcn. Come without fail, for 
; I lhall add no more, being willing to 
fbrprife you." 
\l I How many confuted ideas did thefe 
\\ few tines immediately produce in me! 
ithe Marquis P. S. fent the billet, but 
I was fatisfied that it was not wrote by, 
him, becaufe I knew his chara&er, ami 
that 
T that be was too wife and prudfcnt to 
1 write tome withjfuch liberty,* which he 
wis never entitled to by our friendfhtp. 
The billet feemed to.be wrdte by a wo- 
man, and I could have fworn that the 
hand-writing was not new to me, but 
could not recollect whofe it was, nor 
would I riik the asking any one to fa- 
tisfy my curiofity, or fee where this ad- 
venture was to finifh. I faid nothing 
to my hufband, but ordered my coach 
to be gat ready, and I went, firft to >pay 
a Ihqrt vifit to Xady N. N. and ifroin 
whence to the place of appointment a- 
bovementiohed : it was ntfair tec o'clock 
when I entered my coach, ind a-

taffignation to enquire if aay one was 
there that deiired to fte me? but 1vhat

-rhour, in that place, and with that dif- 
-dain ! I then recolle&ed > taty having 
left the t>iflet on the buteau, open to 
jperufal of any one who had the curi- 
ofity to read it, and inftantly gtfdflfed 
how it was ; nor could I eaifily refraib 
fr6m laughing, becaufe the comical 
circumflances of this accident appeal- 
ed to me like part of a comedy. What 
de 
do you do here ? faid I, in a joke, we 
do not want your company. The Mar- 
quis P. S. replied he, is not yet come; 
when he- arrives, 1 fhall leave- you at

offended me, had . it come from any 
other perfon, but his confufion made 
me ample amends : however, his jea- 
loufy did not heft long, for in a few 
moments after I was furprifcd: with the

My Jourruy to Venice, and the eomknl 
Adventure which happened with my 
old Friend Mr. N. N. .:>/■> 
TH £ Counted had traveliedrfrom 
Paris to Milan that fame -morn* ; 
inrg, and not being at>16 to appear; in 
publick, becaufe their equipage re- 
mained on the road fome mile* behind, 
ihe could not refill her iinftttient curio- ; 
fity of feeing tiie^ being told' at that, 
lodging that I was in this city, *he re-! 
fotved to furprize me by fending that 
'billet without a name $ and the Marquis 
Pi'S, toeing to viftt her, a few horn* afc- 
ter her ^arrival, ihe gave it r. to. Mm 
that it might be conduced &fe into my 
hands. . 
Thus was all the caufe of Count 
Termes' jealoufy and fadnefs difcover- 
ed ; the billet was wrote by the Coun~ 
tefs, but I did not recoiled* her writings 
tho' fiiil I thought to have known it, 
but I wonder how the Count did not 
knpw it, when he found it on my bu* 
reau, read it, and examined it a* his 
5>ieafare; he having courted her for 
onto time, ought to have had fome bet- 
ter 
* c m > 
ter knowledge of her hand. Hfc ftoart 
€o me afterwards, that it even did not 
once enter his thoughts ; and having 
heard from my niaid, it was brought by. 
fcne of the Marquis P. SLfs fervarits, he 
believed it without the leaflt doubt to be 
his : This accident opened my eyes, td 
fee that Count Termes had no good o- 
pinion of my friendihip* with the Mar- 
quis I*. S. and that froifi this perhaps 
his uncommon melancholy arpfe. The 
refpeft which he had for me detained 
him from explaining it better - 9 but ftill 
he retained the worm in his heart ; and 
I muft not only excufe him as Titian, 
but be careful likewife to make him fin- 
cere as a hufhand. If the men a&. 
wrong in being jealous, the women dd 
worie iir trying to cure them by violent 
remedies ; in thefe cafes we ought to 
aft with our hufbands as we do with 
children that are difficult to pleafe, by 
giving them more at one time than what 
they aflc, that they may be quiet the 
longer. With Count Termes; to cure 
him of his jealoufy of one only, I With* 
drew from the company of all ; and to 
eflEablifhhis, and my own quiet, Jddired 
that we might leave Milap, tod^ retire

whom t defired to fee, perhaps for tie 
fa# time. My refolutioa was dis- 
proved by all the nobility of JNJ tl^i} ; 
but I preferred doraeftic quiet to all the 
kindnefi I could receive othffrway* ; 
and if Count Termes was careful- apt 
to give the leaft torment to my anip- 
rous heart, he juftly merited not to 
have the leaft difcontent upon my ac- 
count. When I began my pxm*y 
.fnpm Milan to Venice, I had been £x

at that time ; neither did I aft with

good while on it, an excellent thought 
came into his head - 9 he went direflly 
to the French Ambaflador, his particu-

triumphs over its enemies, and we had 
the glory a fecond time to affift a man 
Who had, with his virtue, rendered 
himfeif worthy of our concern, tf 
ever I was pleafed at doing a kind ac- 
tion for any perfon iii the world, this 
was the time ; becaufe thereby I gain- 
ed the heart of a man who continues ftill 
to be with me and behaves like a real 
friehd, and who in my favour would 
facrifice his life. He could not open 
his mouth without befeeching us to^ 
give him liberty to (hew his gratitude, 
aiii continually begged, under the ti- 
tie of a favour, leave to follow us 
whet ever we went, protefting that he 
wanted nothing of us but our friend- 
fhip, having wherewithal to fubfift him- 
felf. Such generous offers were induce- 
ments fufficient to lay both my own 
heatft,; and that of my hufband, under 
the necsffity of not refuting them. The 
cofeft£>any of a perfon of his character 
fcemed to us a fortune which few can 
meet - with, for few of his character are '

The iteward of my lands had notice 
from Paris of my coming there : being 
accuftomed for many years to govern as 
matter, and not give an account of his 
ndminiftration to any one but my mo- 
< ther, who was fo far off, I don't know 
* ^whether he deiired my arrival, but I 
. found no reafon to be diflatisfied with 
i fflf accounts. All the inhabitants, whom 
» I might call my fubje&s, treated me 
-ttfith the greateft refpe<3;, and feemed 
- Tfcjoiccd at my landing. The firft who 
i earner meet me fome miles out of the 
' feftatej was the intendant befortmeoti- 
, tared; he was a man of lufty ftature, 
* and favage difpofition ; one who had a 
great conceit of his own abilities, was 
jinuch addi&ed to drinking, and ufurp- 
ed an air of importance, and thought 
every word he fpoke an oracle. I paff- 
* ed, amidft the benedictions and pratfes 
of that . little populace, to my palace, 
': which I found to be built with good 
architecture, but was furnifhed with 
goods which bore the face of antiquity : 
this was the point which I moft dif-

arrived loaded with all kinds of mo-

might render my life delightful , My

into a flood of tears, and would haVfe 
fallen at my feet a fecond time, but 1 
prevented it, and with kind words ei*-

t'fekve htfr thtee piftotcs to fuppfy Iter

to mention a word to any one of what 
ihe had faid to me. 
As foon as I returned home, I Cent 
for the fteward, and demanded an ac- 
count of the lands, without Shewing 
to him my knowledge of Rofalina's 
poflfeffion, for that was the name of the 
girl abovementioried ; but that unwor- 
thy' wretch had notice of her fpeaking 
to me, and brought in his pocket-book 
tf Writing, by which he would have 
perfuaded me, that that pofleffion be- 
longed, by antient right, to my mo- 
ther, and by uniting it to the reft of 
the lands, thought to have given me ah 
Authentic proof of his care and fideliy. 
Jt To convince me of fuch a truth that 
writing was not fufficient, from which 
1 could only difcover that one of my 
anceftors had purchafed fome lands, of 
which that was part ; but it might have 
been fold, or given away after that. 
To prove .my fteward unjuft, I muft 
Jieceflarily have had fome writing 
from Rofalina, which might clear up 
her right to poffefs it. When fhe came 
to me the next day, I demanded if fhe 
had 
( 273 > 
had any fuch deeds ? and fhe candidly 
confeffed that fhe could not produce 
one paper to juftify her pretenfions'j

it from his great-grandfather, and that 
my grandfather was then living and had 
never made the leaft objection to it, 
and that every one in the place could 
witnefs for truth all that flie had faid. 
The cafe was of a very intricate na- 
ture ; though I could have decided the 
matter at once, by reftoring to Rofa- 
Una her lands. Her honeft fimplicity 
at, my tribunal merited a greater re- 
compence, but I wanted to fee the 
thing thoroughly cleared up, not to 
prejudice my own family or the fights 
of other*: this curiofity led me to dif- 
cover a fecret, which without this ac- 
cident I Ihould never have found out.

a Manufcripty which make me defirons 
of knowing further. 
IF our fleward had a<fted right with 
refped to the lands, his conduft 
with Rofalina had rendered him wor- 
thy of puniihment. One vice often 
ferves as a light to difcover others by, 
and examining things by degrees, I 
fouq4 hiap gvuity of a hundred other * 
crimes of infidelity and extortions ; I 
.knew that with his falary, by good . 
-management tad proper application to 
.the Cervices of his truft, ne might l>e _, 
able to live creditably, but his income 
could, got fupport any extraordinary 
grandeur ; yet his houfe was better fur- 
' nifhed than mine, his table better fup- 
plied, and his wife was puffed up with 
fo much vanity that fhe drefled richer 
than myfelf ; his falary I knew was not 
equal to his expences, though it was 
fufficient to maintain him and his fa- 
mily .gentedlly without having the leaft J 
occafion to commit a breach of truft. 
Finding him guilty of fo much villany, - * 
aqd Hearing tjtvs complaints of my te- 
nants 
( 275 ) 
nants againft htm, not willing to impo- 
verifh my own family to enrich a 
Granger's, I difcharged him from my 
fcrvice ; and this &&ion gained me 
more than ever the love of every one. 
In the mean time poorRofalina intreated 
meto decide her pretentions, andtho'I : 
was not yet convinced that the land in r 
queftion was hen, yet I was perfuaded 
that fhe merited my affiftance: I enquired 
what her land might render her yearly 
before it was feized, and being told* 
about fix hundred ducats, I affigned v 
her a penfion of fifty ducats a month ; 
with this (he was fo well fatisfied, that ! 
fhe watched every opp ortuni ty of meet- 
ing me, to blefs me and kifs my hand. 
Her obliging attention made me take* " 
fo much delight in her, that I would r ' 
willingly have taken her into my own 
houfe, and fhe would have come with 
as much pleafure, if the age and weak- 
nefs of her mother had not conftrained 
her to tarry with her. Exclufive of 
her genteel manners, her features made 
an impreffion upon my heart as if fhe 
had been in fome fhape related to hie : 
being defirous of doing fier all the good . 
in my power, I refolved to £xkrtririe, 
whether the ground in qaeffidn was :v ' 
really 
( ^^6 ) 
really her property, and by what right 
k came to be hers. 
The records of my family were ftill 
preferved in the caftle, but to perufe 
iuqh a number of writings required 
ibmething more than the patience and 
abilities of a woman; the Abbot feeing 
me defirous to clear up this doubt, of- 
fered to undergo that fatigue, and im- 
mediately fet about it. 
: Amongft the papers he found no- 
thing that could clear our doubt, moft 
part of them being of no fignification^ 
and if there had not happened a ftrange 
accident I fhould have remained ftill in 
.the fame uncertainty. My hufband 
.was gone to Naples about fome domef- 
tic affairs, and I was difcourfing as 
ufual^ with the Abbot about human dif- 
Qi%lers, and philofophifing on the vari- 
ations of time and circumftances : Ma- 
dam, faid he, on examining your pa- 
pers,, I met with a journal manufcript 
of the expences made at various times 
by your anceftors, in the courfe of a 
hundz*ed years paft: I have noted about 
twenty different ways by which in 
fpending their money they did them- 
felves honour in the world ; that k to 
fey,, twenty alterations, according to 
the 
( *77 > 
tlie idea they formed of human great- 
nefs. About an hundred yeaTs ago 
one of your anceftors carried on fome 
buildings merely with the intent that 
the poor, by working, 'might obtain a 
livelihood; and expended, in this man- 
ner, fix thoufand ducats. Another, in 
his time, baniflied from his lands all 
the poor people that had not where- 
withal to live ; and if they were defi- 
rous to remain, he obliged them to 
lirork at this building for half price, 
and with this art faved, at the expencc 
of their labours, upwards of ten thou- 
fand ducats. The great-grandfather 
of your mother, if I am not miftaken, 
gloried in keeping open-houfe to all 
perfons of learning, that had fled from 
the perfecutions of fortune, and taken 
refuge upon his lands; and thirty years 
after, his fon fuffered his own tutor to 
perifh with hunger, and kept open- 
houfe to all mountebanks, buffoons, 
.quacks, and fuch fort of people in the 
whole province, and gloried in the 
company of thefe ignorant impoftors. 
Amongft other things, I have obferved 
a great contrariety m the magnificence 
in Patrimonial affairs; at one time the 
fortune of the woman who married in- 
to your family was depofited, and not

'in the journal, and abbreviated in this 
manner : 
"On occafion of my matter's nttp- 
" tials, expended in the whole; thirty 
" thonfand ducats. " 
In the times nigher to us, I read in 
the journals of more money being laid 
out by your grandfather for one habit, 
than by his grandfather for twenty : 
in fhort, Madam, fo many different 
men, fa many different opinions 5 and 
which are fo many undeniable proofs, 
"d\Zt iiuman reafon is a mere lhadow. * 
" Thefe refleaions of the Abbot W. N. 
being very diverting, made mectefiraus 
6f looking more narrowly into that 
journal, and paffing over from page to 
|»*ge, we by chance caft our eyes on 
the date of April, fifty years paft, and 
found thefe words written : 
.' 'V ToFabrizio, for the clofet in the 
*' Tittle palace of the vineyard, bvra- 
*' cter of mafter, feventeen dumKr 
: * ' : .' At 
X *79 ) 
At the wot d clofet, the Abbot xmdt 
a paufe, and asked me, if I did. not 
.think that word merited fome particu- 
lar attention ? he being well verfed in 
hiftory ,recolle£ted that in thofe days the 
whole kingdom of Naples was embroil* 
cd in eivil difcords, and people of any 
wealth generally hid their riches under- 
ground, and in private holes; that one 
of my anceftors having procured this 
clofet to be made at that time, had un- 
doubtedly hid fome treafure in it $ be- 
fides, feeing no appearance ofany fuch 
place in the little palace, made his fuf- 
pieions ftill the more piaufibte, and lie 
-iofifted that with a little diligence it 
would not be difficult to' find out this 
fecret place. I did not flatter myiebf 
.'with finding a treafune in this place, 
yet the words of the journal had fome 
private meaning, which excited my 
curiofity to fuch a degree, that. I wasr<>- 
folved, at all events, to fearch for it. 
Count Termes being returned front Na- 
ples, we communicated to him our fuf- 
picions, and my thought ; he tried all 
pofiible means to difuade me from it, 
as if he had been foretold of what was 
t# happen; but his perfuafions did not 
avail, nor woulci I be content ' until I 
"..found out the truth : therefore he and 
A a the 
( **o ) 
the Abbot a&cd as archite&s, two coun- 
try mafons, fworn to keep the fecref, 
went to work, and I ftood looking on. 
The little palace of the vineyard was 
a ftrong building, formerly the reft- 
dence of my anceftors, but at this time 
was made but Kttle ufe of* every foot 
of the floor was flruck with a large 
fledge hammer, in order to difcovet, 
by the found, in what place this clofet 
flood : after a long fearch, by flriking 
pne of the middle rooms, we heard a 
hollow found come from the thick part 
of the wall, and on ftriking the fecond 
time, it echoed louder than at firft: 
my hufband till then had been conti- 
nually joking us, but at that noife he 
changed his tone and began to enter- 
tain' <bme hope : the Abbot gloried in 
the truth of his conje&ures, and prided 
fchnfelf on the prerogatives of an anti- 
<jttarian. In the mean while the watt 
continued tumbling down, till at lafl: 
we efpied fome thick planks, which we 
found to be the entrance of the clofet : 
the joy which this fight gave us I can- 
Xiot exprefs, but we were almoft out of

carefied as his own, though ail the peo- 
ple in the caftle knew to the contrary* 
in the while, afar off, grew up the law- 
ful heir of this principality, who* 
meeting 
(286 ) 
meeting with upright and Honeft peopfe, 
who were confcious of his juft rights, 
opened the eyes of his uncle to thedifr- 
honeft conduft of his unworthy coiv- 
fort ; he ftrove to remedy it, but the 
juftice of Providence prevented it, by 
leading him to the ftep to which he 
had condu&ed his innocent brother, 
whofe blood called to heaven for vct>- 
geance ; he was over-powered by hb 
wicked wife, and miferably perifhed 
* by her hand. Things did not change 
face ; the perfidious woman, with the 
abominable price of her dishonour, 
made fuch intereft at the court of 
Naples to difinherit the lawful heir 
to the eftate, that fhe made it believed 
*h&t he was a baftard, and to authenti- 
cate the fucceffion of her fon f made 
him appear lawful : From this, Ma* 
dajm, you defcend by a right line, and 
irom the other, by a right line, de- 
scends poor Rofalina ; and from that 
-time^ under the title of a gift, her an- 
cdiors got that land, which ilie the o- 
' ther day defired, for their mantairance 
andfupport* 
The truth of thefe manufcripts can- 
Mi©* &e doubted ; for by the fame h ap- * 
* p^ars tlmt they were wrote by thqiaw- 
lutihdiiy *£io> escaped, the fury of 1m$

uDcie ; and by other papers I am un- 
formed; that they were prefer ved \>y 
KofalinaVanceftors, with as much cars 
as if they had been gold, but were ta- 
ken from them by force, by the ufur- 
pfcrs of their rights, and malicioufly 
buried in that fecret place, that the re* 
v membrance of them might be forgot. 
Hare the Abbot ceafed, and I began to 
reflect on what I fhould refolve, to a<ft 
properly, and not to do an injury to 
myfelf ; none knew of this fecret but 
ourfelves, and by burning the writing!, 
it might die with us, and be buriedrfor 
ever: but though the thing would be 
concealed. from the eyes of the world, 
could I-for this have acquitted myfeif 
to my own conference ? The guilt of .a 
bad a&ion is not to be determined by 
-tRrf opinion of men, but by its contra- 
riety to the dictates of reafon and equi- 
ty, and whoever poffefles unlawfully 
the right of others, is no better than 
an ufurper ; nor can it juftly be called* 
our own, when we hold it to the pre- 
judice of another. Between me and 
Rofalina there was a confiderable di- 
ftance; but this did not juftify a feizure 
in me, nor diminifh in her the rights of 
herpretenfions: my Marquifate belonged 
to her by right, and if I had not difep- 
vered 
yered tohrrthc^ whole afcir^ i &oaW 
never haye enjoyed it with &tirfa&ion: 
To iofe a pofleflion, which I may fay; 
was the half of my eftate, was not a 
blow half fo terrible to my generous 
heart, as to confider from what diihot 
noujr abl&anceftors my prefent grandeur 
defcended ; this was a reflexion, which 
troubled me more than all the reft ; but 
neither of thefe things ought to have 
given me any concern, becaufe, . in 
ipaldng me lefs proud, it taught me 
lixore wjfdom. ' . ;

whom he recommended to me with fo

Between thofe and the like tender

fgoufe expired ! and I can truly fay;

which ftill runs with blood, arid at this

extream concern aflfetfed me fo mudi; 
that I. was. confined to my bed for twcJ 
months, and would certainly have car-

prefencc of my dear little girl," tile a£ 
fiftance of Rofalina, and the wife tfe- . 
flexions of the Abbot, had fiot. kept 
up my fpirits. My' mother, ftriick 
with exceflive grief at the lofs of my 
liufband, almoft loft her ferifes at the 
news of my illnefs : fhe did not fly' to 
Italy, becaufe I kept her in continual 
hopes of my recovery ; and as ; foon as 
I Recovered, lhe defired me at all event* 
to bring the whole family to Paris, and 
not to depart from it ever more : but

this wa* a point on which we could not 
agree, ana not to dvfpleafe her, liiii^ 
jift with caution : the love of jjny j»o r 
ther and fon, were two obje&s to my 
'tender heart which might indeed en- 
courage me to undertake that journey 
without fear; but yet, after my difmai 
lofs, my melancholy humour, the 
nqifc of . the world, diflike to . the 
court, and application to ftndy, gave 
the preference, in every refpefl, to my 
folitude. 
To mak$ my mother fenfible of th$ 
reafonabtenefs of this refolution, as ma T 
ny letters as would have fiUed an entire 
volume, would riot have been enough j 
the only method I could find was to 
fend Rofalina to Paris, as ihe had 3, 
defire to fee her* there $ and to fend 
w |th her for company the Abbot, whop* 
I commiffioned to perfuade my ipGthe* 
to comply with my defirefi of flaying * 
few years longer in Italy, Notwith-* 
Handing Rofalina defired to fee the 
great world, and a court fo magnificent 
as that pf France, yet (he left me witl* 
the tears ftreaming from her eyes, and 
Icpuld not prevail upon her to depart,. 
but by promifing to follow her to Pa* 
iris the next year. My intentions were} 
different, but partly depended pn the

Abbot, my friend, tp make her refpl#e 
iifc my favour; no age, no ftate, ,m> 
chajra&er ought to' make us forget the 
duty due to our parents : who, more 
than me-, miftrefs of herfelf ? becaufc 
I, being married, being a widow., and 
afar off from my parents, required np- 
thing at tfhear hands to maintain me in 
a ftate fuitable to my condition ; but 
even in the mod trifling affairs, to dif- 
pkafe them I thought was Lnjuftice, and 
leife pieafurc Had I in every thing if not 
gained by their confent. 
Rofalina, accompanied by the Ab- 
bot, departed from my houte provided 
with all neceffaries to appear at Vf r* 
failles, and, at the end of two mpnth^ 
the Abbot returned with permiffipil . 
from my mother for me to ftay iti.Ita* 
ly r , fo long as I found my folitude , 
agreeable.. I then devoted my foul en? 
% ireJy to contemplations^^ the fole fell- ' 
city which, can be expe&ed in this 
world, and which I now was bleflfcd 
with by the company and convsrfatipn 
of a friend, united to me not by paf- 
fion but by virtue. Many days had 
not pafled when the Abbot advifed me, 
for my entertainment, to write my owa- 
adventures, promiflng at the fame time 
to 
to give rae all the affiftaAce in hisipower 
to make my enterprise* the lighter; 
thus, by his perfuafions, I began* fix 
months after my Hufband's death to 
write thefe Memoirs, which to com- 
pleat employed me no lefs than fix 
more. My undertaking was not little 
for a woman, I therefore flatter my- 
felf that it will be entitled to fomc 
praife : I do not prefume to fuppofe 
that it merits eternity, or that it is wor- 
thy the curiofity of my«pofterity: tic 
time fpent in writing it was certainly 
not loft, becaufe in renewing the nae*- 
mory of my misfortunes, it alfo re- 
newed in me the maxims which made 
me undergo them with more conftahcy, 
and prepared me againft all that might 
happen hereafter. This hour in which 
I write, and am upon the point of fi- 
nishing my work, I am arrived to the 
thirtieth year of my age; and if I live 
many years longer, perhaps fomething 
clfe, as uncommon, may happen to 
me : if it fhould fo fail out, I /hall con- 
tinue to take notice of the fame, that 
after my death there may remain an ex- 
a<5i account of my life* 
Whatever is to be the remainder of 
my life, I have not wrote thefe Memoirs 
to obtain the praife of the world. by 
pub- 
1 
( S©7 ) 
publishing them; - neither have I wrpM 
theWi \w lofemy IaboOT by committing 
them to the flames: my intention is 
humourous, but yet reafonable; before 
I die, 1 (hall bury it, and hide it in that 
clofet from which I dug out the antient 
Journals of my family, and which, in 
regard to myfelf, may be called, The 
Closet of my Deceit; and altho* 
before this comes to light, the Adven- 
tures of the Wandering Daughter, 
which were wrote to diflionour my 
name, may be published to all the world, 
^and will, I am perfuaded, be believed 
by many to be the real hiftory of my. 
life, as it happens to contain a few par- 
ticulars which refemble fome of my ad- 
ventures; and although I am fenfible 
that the conceit which they mufl forrti 
of 'me, by fuch a book, cannot -re- 
dound to my credit ; yet, I make no 
doubt but a time will come to difcover 
the deceit : and if thefe my Memoirs, 
drawn by fome friendly hand from their 
obfeurity, fhould hereafter appear in 
public, I hope I (hall have jufticedone 
me. That was a romance very unpro- 
fitable, and this is a true hiftory found- 
ed on fafts. It is not I who have copied 
from that the ideal foundation of thefe 
adventures^ but the author of that has, 
from 
from fame confuted account of hiy life* 
taken the iclea of a romance, the end of 
which does not correfpondwhh the be-* 
ginning, and has mixed with fomt 
truth a hundred thoufand lies; There* 
fore if thefe Memoirs ihbuld«Ver corns 
before the eyes df the public, I hope 
the^r will not deny me that only glory 
which I earneftly defire, to be believed 
a Speaker of Truth. Whtrc<}«fllee
