As thb Tolume may, poffibly, fall into 
the hattds of fome who are yet unacquainted 
with the ftory of Theodofius and Conftantia, 
it is thought neceffary to print it here as re- 
lated by the Speftator No. 164, 
* CoNSTANTiA was a woman of extraor- 
dinary wit and beauty, but very unhappy in a 
father, who having arrived at great riches by 
his own induftry, took delight in nothing but 
his money. 
Theodosius was the younger fon of a de- 
cayed family ; of great parts and learning, im- 
l^roved by a genteel and virtuous education. 
When he was in the twentieth year of his 
age he became acquainted with Conftantia, 
who had not then pafTed her fifteenth. As he 
lived but a few miles diftant from her father^ 
houfe, he had frequent opportunities of fee- 
ing her ; and by the advantages of a good 
X pcrfon, 
perfoQ) and a pleafing converfation^ made fuch 
Atk imprtflioQ on her heart as it was impoffible 
for time to efface : He was himfelf no lefs 
fmitten with Conflantia. A long acquain- 
tance made them ftill difcover new beauties 
in each other, and by degrees raifed in theoi 
that mutual paflion which had an influence on 
their following lives. 
It unfortunately happened that, iti the 
midfl of this intercourfe of love and friend- 
fliip between Theodofius and Conftantia, there 
broke out an irreparable quarrel between their 
parents, the one valuing himfelf too much 
upon his birth, and the other upon his pof- 
feUions. The father of Conflantia was fo in- 
cenfed at the father of Theodofius, that he 
contraAed an unreafonable averfion towards 
his fon, infomuch that he forbad him his houfe, 
and charged his daughter upon her duty never 
to fee him more. In the mean time, to break 
off 
C X 3

^vourable opportuaity tha^ (hould briog them 
together^t he fouiul out a youDg gentlemaQ 
^ a good fortune and an agreeable peribo^ 
whosa he pitched upoa as a husband for h]s 
daughter. He fooa concerted the affair fo well 
that he told Coaflantia it was bis deiign to 
marry her to fuch a geatleman, and that her 
wadding fliould be celebrated on fuch a day. 
ConQaniia, who. was over* awed by the autho- 
rity of her father, and uoable to objeA any 
^ing to fo advantageous a match, received the 
propofal with a profound filence, which her 
father commfinded in her as the mofl: decent^ 
nvmoer: of a virgia's giving her confent to aot 
o^rerture of thait kind* The noife of this im* 
tended marriage ihon reached Theodofius, 
who after a long tumult of pai&ons which oa«

May yoxi loBg be happy in the world, bat for* 
get th^jt tbore was ever fnch a man in it as 
Theodosius.** 
This letter was conveyed to Conftantia that 
fsery evening, who fainted at the reading of it ; 
and the next morning (he was much more alar-* 
i&ed by two or three meflengers, that came ta 
her father's houfe one after another to enquire 
if they had heard any thing of Theodoflus^whot 
it feems, had left his chamber about midnight^ 
and could no where be founds The deep me« 
lancholjF' which had hung upon his mind fome- 
time before) made them apprehend the wor A* 
that 
r *« ] 
ihkt coufd befall him. Conftantia, who khcvf 
that nothing but the report of her marriagei 
could have driven him to fuch extremities, 
was not to be comforted : She now accufed 
herfelf of having fo tamely given an ear to 
the propofal of a hulband, 9nd looked upon 
the new lover as the murderer of Theodofius : 
In (hort, (he refolved to fufTer the utmoft ef- 
fects of her father^s difpleafure, rather than 
comply with a marriage which appeared to her 
fo full of guilt and horror. The father feeing 
bimlelf entirely rid of Theodofius, and likely 
to keep a confiderable portion in his family, 
was not very m(tich concerned at the ob- 
ilinate refufal of his daughter, and did not 
find It very difficult to excufe bimfelf upon 
that account to his intended fon-in-law, who 
had all long regarded this alliance rather as 
a match of convenience than of love. Con- 
fiantia had now no relief but in her devotions 
and exercifes of religion^ to which her afflic- 
tions 
dons had fo entirely fubjeAed her mind, that 
after fome years had abated the violence of 
her forrows, and fettled her thoughts in 
a kind of tranquillity^ (he refolded to pafs 
the remainder of her days in a convent. Her 
father was not difpleafed with a refolution 
which would fave money in his family, and 
readily complied with his daughter's intentions. 
Accordingly in the twenty-fifth year of her 
age, while her beauty was yet in all it's height 
and bloom, he carried her to a neighbouring 
city, in order to look out a fiAer-hood of nuns 
among whom to place his daughter. There 
was in this place a Father of a convent who 
was very much renowned for bis piety and 
exemplary life; and as it is ufual in the Ro- 
mi(h church for thofe who are under any great 
afflidlion, or trouble of mind, to apply them- 
felves to the mod eminent Confeflbrs for par- 
don and cpnfolation^ our beautiful votary took 
ttvft 
the opportuDity of coDfelDog herfelf to iliUl 
celebrated Father. 
We muft now return to Theodofius, who 
the very morning that the abovementioned 
enquiries had been made after him, arrived at z 
religious houfe in the city where now Conftan* 
tia refided ; and defiring that fecrefy and con- 
cealment of the Fathers of the convent, which 
is very ufual upon any extraordinary occaflon, 
he made himfelf one of the order, with a pri- 
vate vow never to enquire after Conftantia ; 
'whom he looked upon as given dWay to his ri- 
val| upon the day on which, according to 
common fame, their marriage was to have 
l^een folemnized. Having in his youth made 
« good progrefs in learning, that he might de- 
4licate himfelf more entirely to religion, be en- 
tered Into holy orders, and in a few years be- 
icame renowned for his fanflity in life, and 
;tiiofe i^ns feotiments which he infpired into 
4 aU 
i w  
tU wbb cottyeriffd with him. It was this holy 
Bian to whom Conftaotia had determined to 
apply herfelf in confeilion, though neither (h< 
nor any others befides the Prior of the con* 
vent, knew any thing of his name or family* 
The gay, the amiable Theodoiins had now 
taken npon him the name of Father Francis^ 
and was fo far concealed in a long beard, a 
fhaven head, and a religious habit, that it was 
impoffible to difcover the man of the world in 
the venerable conyentuaL 
As he was one morning (hut up in his con- 
fefflofial, Conllantia kneeling by him, opened 
the ftate of her foul to him ; and after bating 
given him the hiAory of a life full of inno« 
cence, flie burfi out in tears, and entered upon 
that part of her fiory, in which he himfetf 
bad fb great a fhare. My behaviour^ fays flie^ 
has, I fear, been the death of a man who 
)^ad no Qther &ult but that of laving me too 
much. 
much. Heaven only knows how (tear he was 
to me while he lived, and how bitter the re- 
membrance of him has been to me fince bis 
death. She here paufed, and lifted up her 
eyes that dreamed with tears toward the Fa- 
ther ; who was fo moved with the fenfe of her 
forrows, that he could only command his voice, 
which was broke with fighs and fobbings, fo 
far as to bid her proceed* She followed his 
diredions, and in a flood of tears poured out; 
her heart before him. The Father could not 
forbear weeping aloud, infomuch that in the 
agonies of his grief the feat (hook under him. 
Conftantia, who thought the good man was 
thus moved by his companion towards her, 
and by the horror of her guilt, proceeded 
with the utmofl contrition to acquaint him with 
that vow of virginity in which (he was going 
to engage herfelf, as the proper atonement 
for her fins, and the only facrifice (he could 
make to the memory of Theodofius. The 
Father, 
Fattier, who, by this time, had pretty well 
compofed hitxtfelf, burft out again in tears op- 
bn hearing that sianle, to which he had beea 
fo long dlfufed, and upon receiving this in- 
fiance of an unparalleled fidelity from one 
who, he thought, had feveral years fince givert 
herfelf up to the poITefHon of another. Amidit 
the interruptions of his forrows, feeing his 
|)enitcnt overwhelmed with grief, he was only 
able to bid her from time to time, be com* 
fbrted— to tell her that her fins were forgiven 
Iier— that her guilt was not fo great as fhe 
apprehended — that fhe fliould not fuffcr her- 
felf to be afflifled above meafure. After 
ivhich he recovered himfelf enough to give 
her the abfoluilon in form ; direfting her at 
the fame time to repair to him again the next 
day, that he might encourage her in the pious 
refolution flie had taken, and give her fuitabl(i 
exhortations for her behaviour in it. Conftan- 
tia retired, and the next mbrnidg renewed her 
than with true 
religion. 
After all, what I have filid on this fub- 
Jeft is only to draw from you your opinion, 
which will always have great influence with 
CONSTANTIA.

Hath God created a Paradife^ and will not 
man look around hioi to enjoy it ; but, like 
his firft parent, as defcribed by the Eoglifh 
poet, fiill penfively contemplate himfelf in the 
murmuring fountain ? Shall he for ever feek 
his image in the waters of adverfity; and 
fhall the fair fcenes of life be deformed 
through fuch a mirror ? 
Surely to abftaln from plcafure is no in- 
ferior degree of guilt ; fince that very abfti- 
nence is a reproach to the eternal and invari- 
able Benevolence. 
From whom do.we derive every appetite? 
By whofe wifdbm were \the fine organs of 
fenfation formed ? To' wfioie "bounty do we 
owe the objefts of gr^tifieation ? -And to

was this more or lefs than the charge of in-

The affe^ions^ you fay, cannot hz fet on

as man is capable of paying, is derived from 
his mortal feelings, perceptions and enjoy- 
ments. — ^When he finds himfelf happy in 
tbefe, he is naturally led to adore that Being 
who gave them ; to look up with gratitude 
to him, and fo far to Jet his affe^ions on things

allotment in an improved ftate of exiftence.— « 
Thus far, even a regard to things on earth, 
may affift- his piety, and encourage his.

Our 
C 17 ] 
Our ideas of heavenly objeAs are eX'^ 
tremely abflrafted from fenfe, and yet it is 
difficult through any other medtum^ to extend 
the afFeftions to them. — ^It has been obferved, 
with philofophical truth, by one of the (acred 
writers, That if a man love not his brother 
whom he hath feen^ how Jhould he love God 
whom he hath not feen? — I will borrow his 
mode of reafoning, and will add, if a maa 
love not thofe gifts of God which he hath 
feeti, how (hould be let his ajffedion on thofe 
which he hath not feen? — If he hath not 
■ 
been pleafed with thofe enjoyments which 
the divine bounty hath allotted hun^ as pecu« 
liarly adapted to this ftate of Beings what 
moral profpeA can he have of being better 
iatisfied in any future ftate ? 
But you quarrel with the moral tendency 
of fleafure^ and load it with the heavy charge 
of vitiating and debafing the mind ; adding^ 
C that 
C ^8 J 
th;U {elfi(hoe&, aod a negled of the (bciar 
duties, are iofeparable from the purfuit of 
k.-^Has not my friend made a nifnomir her^ 
in giving the name of PUafure to Vice? 
Change the terms only, and the charge is 
juft. It is impoffible that inn^ent pleafure^ 
fliould vitiate^ or that delicate enjoyments 
fiionld debafe the mind. — It is impoffible that 
thofe focial delights which fiften the heart, 
fliould make it felfijh^ or exclude from it's 
feeliogs a regard for the happinels of othei:8. 
If we look into the ipinds and manners of 
men, we (hall find that not the very abdemi* 
ous, the mortified, or the fandimonious, 
are moft diftinguifhed for focial virtues.— 
The reafon, I think, is obvious — ^when iii- 
nocent appetites and defires are reftrained,

hamaokind will merit your attention.*— Va- 
rious are the advantages to be derived from 
this conrfe of reading.— -A celebrated writer 
of antiquity has obferved, that, he who if 
ignorant of what happened before his own 
times, is fiill a child. — Before I had made a 
a competent acquaintance with hiftory, I 
never could read this paflage without pain 
and (hame. — I imagined that the eyes of the 
great Orator were upon me, and that I ap- 
peared childifli before him. I am now ex* 
tremely well convinced, that what he obferv- 
ed, was comparatively juft.

good people, I am vain of being free from 
vanity. 
But all the Inftruftiona of my amiable 
Philolbpber have been feafoned with fo much 
politeneis, or conveyed in fach an indireft 
manneft that, while I had all the opportn- 
nity of profiting by them, I conld hardly 
ever difcem that tbey were intended for my 
nle. — If then yoor lafli letter pleafed me 
more than any other, it is becaafe I am idle^ 
and volnptuoos, and take more pleafure in 
poetry than in philofophy. 
T£T the genius of Milton had fuch a 
moral torn, that he feldom wrote poetry with* 
ODt writing pbilofophy ; and even the PaSoral 
yon have fo obligingly tranflated, is not, I find, 
withoat fomething of it. How beautifully does 
he bewail the loft advantages of friendihip !

To whom (hall I my hopes and fears impart^ ' 
Or trad the cares and follies of my heart ? 
And alas! how truely does he lament that 
man 
In all the coondefs nnmhers of his kind. 
Can fcarcely meet with one congenial mind ! 
Yoong as I am, I have felt the force of this 
truth, and have made many melancholy re- 
flexions upon it) after the painful, ridicu- 
lous, trifling, and impertinent vifits I have been 
obliged to pay and receive, from the filller 
part of my fex. Horrid tyranny of fafliion 
tbat impofes this upon us ! What right can an 
equality, or a fuperiority of fortune give one 
lady to rob another of her time, fenfe and 
jpatience ? I fay her Senfe f for the converfa- 
tion of fools leaves ai tih^ure of folly upon 
us.— What title has drefs or figure to lay tax

upon us for adminuioQ ? Do not they who eX" 
pcA this, iofiilt our Hnderfiandiiig ? And are 
not thofe who pay it, the (laves of fdly ? O 
that the (hackles of <^ft6m were once brokea^ 
and that we might chufe our fodety out of 
cither fex without cenfare, or incouyenience ! 
Just before I received your letter, I was 
delivered from thcmoft defpicabk and im* 
pertinent fet of vifiters, that ever diigraced 
the name of good company.— -To me fucb 
fifits are always vrfitadons. — To the above* 
mentioned deliverance, you may, if you 
pleafe, impute fome degree of that extra- 
ordinary plealbre I afcribed to the pemial of 
your letter.— This I %, left { (hould contri- 
bute to make you, what you have fo often 
made me, vain } and thus, at lea(^ you muft 
acknowledgei that I outdo you ia genero(ity.

hend when they languUh, or decline.— It de- 
rives not its fupport from enthufiafm, and, 
confequently, cannot fuffer, when enthnfiaim 
dies away. 
While thus I comfort, I hope I do not 
deceive myfelf.:— But, Ihould even that be the 
cafe, let your ingenuity for once, give way to 
your compafEon, and do not undeceive me.-— 
This is, perhaps, the only inftance in which I 
could be fadsfied with myfelf, for declining 
the report of truth.
