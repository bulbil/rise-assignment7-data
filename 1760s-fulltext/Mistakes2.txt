T O R p Fanfly was an hour with 
"^^" Lady Felham yefterday— -an hour 
foliciting'o'n his knee, that I might abhor 
the day in which I was born. How^elfe 
could it be had he obtained my mother's 
confent! a mother to whofe will I 
would fall a voluntary viftim rather 
than difpleaie, rather than make her un- 
happy. Believe me, Viftoria, I would 
readily forfeit my own exiftence could it 
fave her but a tear : I would fpurn the 
ftruggle$ of nature, haften to annihila-

I owe to Lady Pelham, your furprife would

T ORD Fanfly, my mod pafConate 
"^ lover^ has proudly taken his leave, 
Vidoria — ^proudly, without one tear- 
without even reproaching me with my in- 
fcnfibility. He is gone to Paris, there 
to be finifhedy I prefume, in the glorious 
endowment of veiling his ignorance and 
ftupidity under the bragging air of ielf*- 
fufficiency.

For this alpae,' bow many wonoen arc ad«

Nature had foldy .produced for fitting, 
walking talking, or drefllng xumo^

How deferted, Vidoria^ our fafhio*^ 
Bflbk ]cvees, were minions obliged to 
praiie 
g pAilion from fentiment, and the feel- 
ings of the heart from the Tallies of ima- 
gpBation. — To me it belongs to relate, 
to thee to analyfe, compare and der 
cide. 
Though Sir John's referve encreafed 
at every vifit, he was not kfs -amiable, 
lefs entertaining, lefs happy in the amufe- 
mciits he procured. us. His travels were 
an iaexhauftible topic — ^His aftion is 
noble, eafy^ in&nuatiog, and admirably 
fcts off the ^hvms of his elocution.--r-He

Carolina, over the word attempt, for— 
let me not tell thee the why, — , 
Mufic afforded him perpetual oppor- 
tunities to difplay an unwearied complai- 
sance in complying with the repeated en- 
cores of my enchanted aunt.— Never 
was (he tired with liftening, never was he 
tired with gratifying her humour. 
Wcdnefday 1 1 o'Clock. 
Often, when alone with Sir John, has 
he, onr a fudden, taken my hand-— flolen 
it half way to his lips— let it go im- 
mediately, and begun a lively conver-* 
fation on fubjeds which he knew I liked, 
or was tolerably verfed in. 
I 
I 53 ] 
I am a ftranger to the art he employed ; 
this you muftdifcover, Carolina, but I 
had always a better opinion of my own 
wit and tafte after having converfed with 
him* 
My aunt daily compliments me on the 
improvement I have made, thefc five 
weeks, in knowledge of the world, and 
applauds the elegance of my diftion, the 
propriety of my remarks, and the accuracy 
of my defigns. — She whifpers alfo, but 
very foftly, that my (hape is more free, my 
curtfies le(s confufed, and my fighs, mind 
this, Carolina, and my fighs lefs fre^ 
quent. 
Frofby complains of my coldnels.— 
He fays that fmce Sir John has vifited fa* 
liarly at Brenton-hall, I receive him not 
with the fame finiles as before.— Twice 
V 3 has 
E 54 3 
has he haughtily required mem tcH him 
my true motive fot contmxiing,'of late^ fe 
long in the library. — ^He thought I 
once attended more carefully to my drcft, 
and has often taken a real pique at my 
favouring Sir John with a tune9 a noie« 
gay, or a walk in the garden. 
Should not I be very amiable, Carolina, 
were I ignorant, impertinent, and ill-na- 
tured ? Don't you think that vanity more 
than love is concerned in his dilpleafure ? 
Would not he otherwifc be more care- 
ful of my glory ? — To pride in Sir John 
being a witnefs of my inclination for 
him! — Is not this both indelicate and 
ungenerous ?— Can he wifh to make him- 
felf happy by another's pain? — ^Had Sir 
John the fame thought!— did he dare 
to cxprefs it! How furprifing his 
moderation, yet how commendable ! 
Can 
I 55 1 
Can a man of £> fleiy a dij^tofi*^

I am glad you were deceived, Caro-: 
Una, 
One day~-one day, do I fky !— every 
day, Ci^rolina, I read in the looks, of 
Sir John, " Vidoria f were I certain you 
^ loved not Frolby, and that my homage 
^ would not be thought unworthy, how 
•• happy I**— Then, Carolma, 1 turn my 
eyes fh>m him, and will read no more*

How 1 gradually came to rejoice in 
the prefcnce of Sir John, and to mifi him 
when he was gone, you muft inquire in 
your conjuring book, Carolina. .

I formerly complained of the injufldce 
of Frofby-^— I was dilpleafed with his 
doubts^ his fears, his curiofity.— — Many 
times have I been tortured to the foul 
with his indifcretion, Was it not, Ca* 
l^olina, to that perpetual a^tation in which 
my heart was kept up— to that fuccet 
(ion of different emotions which furniflicd 
fancy with no other objeft than Frofby, 
that he was indebted for my extreme^ 
partiality ? 
Is he not now unfeafonably eafy?— Why 
^6es he give me leifure to refled? — So 
weU acquainted with the refUefTnefs of hu-

I i6i 2 
man nature — ^with our natural* aptnd^ 
to change, fhould not he keep me con* 
ftantly feeling and deluded ? 
Is not an implicit compliance with our 
defires as fatal to a lover, as an eternal 
refiftance to them ? Has he lefs to fear 
frorn our indifference than our diflike ? 
. in fociety the complaifant are leldom 
agreeable — ^this you have often remark- 
ed, Carolina. In love why fhouklJtnot 
be the fame ? — ^AlasJ why don't we va? 
lue a good, but in proportion to the di& 
ficulty of obtaining it ? Why is a " Yes,'*

The more flajtcring my miftricc had 
been, the more fcnfibly did I feel its fally. 
Enraged at the fond diftinftion conferred 
upon Frofby, I approached Lady Vic-

if W tht name! of modefty, Vi^oria,- canft

Thymiftakes are no novelty to me. 
Long 2ff} have I difcovercdthy indiflerence 
through the raving expreiSons thou co- 
veredft it with. 
Born with exquifite feelings, ever in 
want of being amufed or afieded, thou 
obeyedll thy natural tendency to love, 
whilft thy deluded fancy pointed to FroAy 
as the caufe of thy emotion. Thou rxnddft 
have as eafily been fuiprifed btp an in- 
dinaticn for a Krd^ ^f^^. or a piffure^ 
As pride delights in the moft diftant ho- 
mage, ib does extreme ienfibility in trifles, 
or things of the greateft moment. 
Thou lovedft not Frofltyy, as now thou 
doft Sir John; nor hadft thou ever renx>ved 
the veil with which thy prepofleffion for 
the 
the former had intanglcd thy tinderftanding, 
but fbr the fuperiority of the latter which 
forced thee to fhidce it - off, to fee with 
thy own eyes, to judge with thy own 
reaibn. — - — The burning torch he has put 
in thy bofom, has difpclled the gloom that 
cncompafled thy foul, and reftored it to 
the exertion of its native rights.-*-Toc> long 
had thefe been invaded by the delicacy of 
thy organs ^too long had thy imagl- 
tion fwayed thy fenfes, heightened then: 
jUufion, aiid favoured Frofby. 
Thou art not the firft, Viftoria, that 
has erred with the full belief of being in 
the right. Thoufands daily objed to rea- 
fon for the judge of their ienfations. 
*Tis the unavoidable effeft of fenfibility— ^ 
and perhaps the greateft advantage one 
can poflefs.

I were near thee when-; — but huih !
