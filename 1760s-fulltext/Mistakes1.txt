What need have I of fiditious orna-

Lady Victoria Nevil to Lady 
Carolina Pelham. 
T T ERE has been a meteor, Carolina ; 
a meteor which ftione fo bright, and 
radiant, tliat our eyes were-almoft dazzled 
with it. It came from London, and (top- 
ped for a fortnight in Cumberland : its 
motions were fo quick and rapid, that it 
B feemed 
feenifcd in tweiity places at once/ Vefy 
likely, what was fo new, and fo pecu-- 
liarly ftriking to us,*: is quite familiar to 
you : London furnifhes more than one 
of^ th^fc phcnomenons; and Sit Johv 
Modish is not the only man who has ex- 
changed nature for art, and fenfe for wit.

broidered fluttering beau !— *— Howpeoplc

I have been fed to thefe refleftiohs, by 
a fcandalous report raifed againft Lady

dunging, on $ fudden, his flattering behftr 
viour into a mortilyiiig iodifierencje,. flicf an 
length bunched into fociety^ and moft; 
. Mkely was courted into a revenge.

it not very hard, Madam ? — 
Lady Victoria, Sir John, knows man-

would not fcruple to take advantage of her ' 
ingenuity, to gain her heart, that their 
whole life might be a perpetual fcene of joy 
and h^ppinefs ? — No — ^let me be ever fo 
hated I will be like myfelf. If my love,, 
my refped for the virtues of Lady Vic- 
toria cannot change me, no pretext 
whatever fliall force me to wear a perfi- 
dious mafk.—— She (hall never reproach 
me with the intention of betraying her iate- 
a miftake.— -^ 
Pity me. Lady Carolina; and if friend- 
fhip can allow you to write to her of a 
man, though unworthy of her attention, 
pray write— -Let me beg the favour on^.

T7K7HEN thou fpeakeft, Frederick,

when, in the benevolence of thy heart, 
thou helpeft the friendlefs man of honour, 
I commend thee : but when thy pen writes 
of love, as thou art then no longer my 
fenfible Frederick, I heartily laugh at 
the Ihadow thou ofFereft me of thyfelf. 
Thou art in Icvi what Alexander was in 
painting — a mere dunce to be ridiculed 
by a feeling boy of fifteen. 
Thou wouldft have me, fince I chufc 
not to leave Cumberland, fpirit away

LETTER XXXI. 
Lady Carolina Pelham to Lady Vic- 
toria Nevij.. 
I Will write to you, Viftoria, with my 
ufual fincerity : expedt no mercy from 
me when thy head rules thy heart, or this 
takes a flight from the former. Thou haft 
been by turns» theie few days, the flave 
of each, but though it flatters my pride 
to find my Vidoria is not faultlefs, I will 
furnifli thee with an antidote againfb 
it. 
Faflions have their degrees, let fools 
ay what they will, unlefs we are totally 
deprived of the faculty of reafoning, 
by 
c 199' r 
by flecp, ftupiditjr, or madnefs. Love 
and hatred rife, by flow progreffions, to 
the fiimmit of infatuation, and either of 
thefe pajQBons may be rooted from our 
hearts, when reafon is warned of theirs exr 
iftence by feeling and r^fledtion. 
Let a fentimcnt be ever fo pleafing, it 
Is hourly contradifted by pride, or felf- 
kitereft, which conftantly point to us dif-' 
grace and forrow, the natural efFefts- 
of a falfe ftep, and a blind prepofleflion. 
Tofaythsit thefe misfortunes are not in- 
herent to every fentimenty and that mutual 
love is exempt from them, is to contradift 
experience. This proves that we are 
'formed of contradidions •, thatnopaflion 
whatever keeps long in its meridian j 
and that it is both poffible, and probable, 
we are often deluded by not ftriftly 
fearching our hearts, and granting too 
K 4 much 
[ 200 J 
much to nature, and not enough to' rca- 
fon, 
-1 know how agreeable it is to be de- 
ceived. Delufion is the life of a fcnfible 
lover ; it takes up his time, his thoughts, 
and its charms, almoft realifed by imagina- 
tion, are always wjplcoihc to his raptured 
heart. Hence the many overfights and 
the erroneous credulity which lead to 
difappointment and regret. 
Human wifdom, Viftoria, has feldomer 
thecked ftntiment than fubmitted to it: 
'tis our fate to be fomc times lulled by 
nature into a forgetfulnels . of the means 
which effenrially tend to our own hap. 
pinefs. When reafon is thrown into con- 
fufion by the tumultuous fpirits forcing 
their way to the head, to fill it only with 
the idea of a favourite blifs, it helps not 
to 
201 ] 
to cxtinguifh the fermenting fire, and de- 
liver the foul from the violent gales of a 
tempeftuous paflion, 
Happinefs is not to be attained by gi- 
ving a loofe to prqudice. Let us not en- 
deavour to enhance the value of a fenfa- 
tion, and add to our fecuritjh by a falfe 
efteem of the objefts before us, left we 
fliould find the reality fall fhort of our 
fanguine expeftation, and be forced intx> 
a contempt of /nirfdves. 
The pleafure of being beloved, is the 
higheft a mortal can enjoy : but as it is 
not at all times to be fecured, through 
the incoftftancy ingrafted in our tempers^ 
I wifh we could fed it moderately, that 
we might not be involved in the affliftion 
foUowing an irreparable lofs. In poflejCr 
fing wc fhouH be ever ready to be deprived^*

2 o'clock. 
Thou, my Vidloria, thou furely fceleft 
that thefe refledtions are truly adapted to 
thy own fituation, and that I have fet 
in their true light the dangers impend- 
ing on thy paffion for Frofby. 
Soothed in the calm of a full aflurance 
of his love, you will not lofe one thought 
about his indifcretion ; and though he 
be unjuft and unreafonable, he muft have 
no failings, fince their principle is his 
tcndcrnefs for you. Unfufpefting girl ! 
You frighten me. Your candour and in- 
genuity9 will lead you into an imprudent 
tranquillity 
[ 203 ] 
tranquillity of mind, from which if one 
day forced to aroufe, it will be to pals 
immediately to the moft exquifite con- 
fufion and anxiety. You will defpife and 
hate yourfelf for having trufted fo much 
to your heart,, and the feeming good qua* 
lities of your lover* 
No body would have mankind more 
perfeft than I : but as it is not in my 
power to adorn every individual with my 
Vidoria's virtues, why ftiould flie be a 
viftim to her generofity ? See men as 
they are, not as you wilh them to be, 
and dare to examine the heart of Frofby. 
Confider, Viftoria, how naturally men 
flight what comes with eafe, that the dif- 
ficulties of pleafing make them languifh 
in 
[ 204. ] 
in unfpeakable defires. • They delight in 
obftaclcs, and to . re/nain in fufpence.— * 
I teJl thee, art and indifference will com- 
mand their adoration, whilft ingenuity and 
tendernefs' arc fhunned and uncourtedv 
It is a foible we inherit from nature, and 
Frolby has it in his heart as much as 
any man in the creation. 
Sir John Modifh's remark, that he would 
reckon it a prodigy were you both as 
deeply in love now as you were fome years 
ago, is not fo abfurd. . How canweanfwer 
we fhall be neither unjuft nor ungrateful ?—* 
You make lov^, Vidtoria, the ftudy of 
every day, the bufinefs of every hour, 
when it fhould only be a diverfidh : you 
exert your utmoft fenfibility to cmbeU 
lifh it with the gayeft colours, and nevet 
once refleft it is the work of your ima- 
gination. Awake not, fweet girl, from 
the 
C ^^5 ] 
the agreeable dream : continue in the lo- 
ving fit : be for ever loft to every other idet 
than that of being beloved. 
5 o'Cloclu 
Dots love, once fettled in the hearty 
grow too powerful for rcftraint ? Can it 
not be erafed without tearing a part of 
it ? Are we unable to overcome, and are 
the efforts of realbn vain ? No, Vifto- 
ria, they are not vainj though attend- 
ed with mighty difficulties^ What arc 
Tre.to aim at but our own felicity ? Shali 
we be fatisfied with the fhadow> when we 
can /attain the reality ? What is an hour 
of rapturous delufion to years of happi- 
nefs ? Are we not ftrcngthened by this 
confideration, and enabled to triumph, 
ftnd difpel the cloud which intercepts 
the light, and obfcures our underftand" 
ing?- 
To 
[ 206 ] 
To love, and to be always loved ! fine 
talk, indeed ! Set that apart, Viftoria, for 
your dreaming minutes, but let it not be 
liftened to, when awake : never flatter 
yourfelf that Frolby has no fault, becaufe 
he appears to your fafcinated eyes to have 
none. He has his ftiare of weaknefs and 
depravity infeparable from humanity. 
Truft not, Vidoria, to the outward form 
of a man.— I am difpleafed at Frofby's pror 
ceedings : they feem too ftrongly tainted 
with injuftice and tyranny. Be em- 
boldened to judge his behaviour, and the 
charm that furrounds thee will diflblve. 
Love him more and more, if he deferves 
thee, but hate hinr in proportion as he 
may have deceived thee. 
Courage, dear girl, fhake oflT the yoke 
of prepoffcflion, and let Carolina no 
longer 
[ 207 ] 
longer reproach thee with a fingle failing. 
I hate Frofby for having made me difco- 
ver one : yes,] thy partiality for him is one, 
and a very great one^ — ^Poor Sir John ! —

Indeed thou deferveft not the love he has
