Lord William G to Lady Sarah B ; 
T^T O — not one hour more will I truft my 
happinefs to fortune and thee. From this 
minute, on myfelf alone I depend for thy pot 
feffion. Thy foul is too timorous j mine will 
bravely think of daggers, and my hand without 
hefitation execute its commands. Thy prifon I 
will enter with defpair and death— I'll free thee, 
or I fhall live no more, I am on the rack till 
I fee thee.
