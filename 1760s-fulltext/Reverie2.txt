from this change. The fpirit read my fcnti- 
ments in my looks, and fmiling cxprcflivcly, 
" You arc now going to take a view of fcencs,

" which furround them on every fide, and are 
^' fo flrong as to deceive the very adlors of them. 
^' The limitation of the human faculties makes 
*' it neceflary, that obje£ls fhould be prefented 
'^ to you in a regular fucceffion ; as that gene- 
*' ral view which conveys knowledge intuitive- 
" ly to fuperior beings, v/ould only dazzle your 
" mind, and involve it in perplexity and con- 
'' fufion.. But this the more important duties 
**' of my office will not permit my attending to, 
" at prefent. I have already devoted as much 
'^ time to your gratification as i can fpare. You 
** muft therefore proceed alone, and make your 
^' own obfervations. For this reafon it will be 
*' proper to place you immediately in the fcer^ 
" of adlion. Your attention will there be freed 
*' from the diftra6lion of a more diftant and 
*' complicated view ; and you fhall have other 
*' afliftances, to remedy the inconvenience of 
^^ my abfence." Saying this, he took my. 
hand, and tranfported me, inflantancoufly, in 
the fame manner as before, into the country 
which was the feat of the war. 
High as my expecStations had been, this nearer 
view of the paths of human glory chilled my 
foul. I turned my eyes away in horror; and, 
in the inftinilive impulfe of affright, moved 
clofe to my guide for protedion. " I have 
*' often cautioned you (refumed he, In an ac- 
*' cent of reproof) againft forming your judge- 
'* ment of any thing too precipitately. But 
*' now you were delighted at the thought of

'^ as your hopes of receiving pleafure, from be- 
*' holding the miferies of others, were then un- 
" juftiiiable. I have told you, that your form 
*' is imperceptible to human fenfe. It is alfo 
*' impaflive to the injuries which affecR: morta-

*Sof which you fee the beings before you la-

*' You may therefore mix with the multitude 
" without apprehenfion, and make your re- 
" marks on every thing that occurs, with deli- 
*' beration and eafe ; to enable you to do which, 
*' I have freed your mind from the prejudices 
*' that have hitherto obilru6led your reafon, fo 
" that you will now behold all things in their 
'' genuine colours; and as fome knowledge of 
*' the pall lives of the pcrfons concerned in the 
*' fcenes you arc going to enter into, may oc- 
*' cafionally be necefHiry to explain their prefent 
" a6tions, your faculties are enlarged with a 
'' power of looking back, and reviewing the 
*' whole feries, as readily and diftindly as you 
'' do the objedts recorded in your memory. 
" Your motions alfo, as you are unincumbered 
" v/ith matter, depend abfolutely on your will, 
'* by a fmglc a6t of which you may tranfport 
" yourfelf whither-foever you pleafe, in an in-

*' it is proper to reconduct you to the world of 
*' man, Twill attend. Till then, obferve the cau- 
^' tion I have given you, and proceed without 
*' farther limitation or reftraint." — With thefe 
v/ords he vaniflied from my fight. 
The firft emotions of my furprize at being 
left in fuch a condition may be ealily conceived. 
But they laded not long. I foon felt the ad- 
vantages of the favours beilowed fo liberally up- 
on me ; in the confcioufnefs of which I loft all 
fear, and direftly prepared to avail myfelf of 
them, in the moft extenfive manner, l^he 
more than martial animofity with which this 
war appeared, by the dcfolation of the country, 
and the miferies of the inhabitants, to be car- 
ried on, made me conclude that it muft have 
arifen from fome moft important caufe. To 
learn this I dire^Slly entered into the army that 
lay neareft to me, where I imagined I iliould 
readily receive the information I wanted j judg- 
ing- that every individual m.uft be acquainted 
v/ith the m.otives for a war in which he ha- 
zarded his life, and of courfe they muft be the 
fubjecl of the general converfation. 
< The

The army was compofed of mercenaries of dif- 
ferent nations hired by a foreign power, whofe 
©wiifubjeiSls niade aconCderablepart ofit, tho' 
underthe fupremc command of one of the fornicr; 
and was led hither, into the country of an ally 
^and friend, according to the rules of military 
equity, to defend the fovereign's own dominions 
from the invafion of an enemy, who witli equal 
lufticc marched his forces to the inuircrinunate 
oppre/Tion of friends and foes, through whofe 
territories they pafibd, to wreak his vengeance 
on this part of his adverfary's fubjetSls, for i]i- 
iuries he imagined he had received from another, 
who were fuperior to his power, and with 
whom thcfe had no connection in nature or 
intereil, other than (in this cafe) the misfortune 
of being under the government of the fame fo- 
vereign. 
Thi.: generrl account I foon le:'.rncd, and fav/ 
abundantly confirmed, both by the appearance 
of the army, and the manner of its proceeding ; 
but of the real origin of the war, or the end 
propofed by it, except plunder and pay^ the fol- 
diers appeared utterly ignorant, and indeed un- 
concerned about them, plodding mechanically 
to the field to light, with as much indifference 
as oxen do to plough. 
Shocked at an infenfibility fo dif^-raceful to 
beings who boafl: of the blefling of reafon, I 
advanced to the ccmmanucr, from whom I 
hoped to learn fomething fat is factory, in mat- 
ters fo immediately condu6icd by himfelf. He

'' me as great a fool as themfelves, to fend 
"me fuch orders ; orders which common 
" {en(e might inform them I will not obey. 
** The people are out of humour, forfooth, at 
*' the length and expence of ^the war ; and fo 
" their wife maflers want me to pufh it with 
" more vigour, to bring it to aconclufion. But 
" they will find themfelves miflaken, I promile 
«' them. No ! No ! I will have no general 
<' actions ; nothing that can poiTibly be decifive 
*« either way. That is not mybufmefs. The 
*' profits of my command are too confiderable 
*' to be thrown away in that manner. If I 
" fhouid be beaten, they will inftantly chufe 
" another general, without ever confidering 
<< that I only obeyed their own orders. And if 
'^ I obtain a compleat vidlory, the war is at 
" an end ; and of courfe my profit alfo. No ! 
*' No ! I will have no decilive a61:ions. While 
" they are maflers of a ducat to pay me, I will

<' will; and whether they win or lofe, isamat-

" and prevent their complaining of idlenefs. I

my army, and that of the enemy, is fuch as 
fufficiently juftifies my cautious condu£l ; at 
the fame time, ihat the difference in the ap- 
pointments and goodnefs of the men fecures 
me from danger of difgrace, and makes the 
glory I acquire in this defenfive war cheaply 
earned. Indeed the greatefl difficulty often 
is to divide their force, and direct their ar- 
dour in fuch a manner, as to prevent their 
defeating their enemies totally, againft all 
difadvantages, and contrary to my inten-

j^ gilded bait to catch a gudgeon. The hejl cure for 
a matri?nc7iial furfeit ; with a new ?notive fo^ 
entering into the ?nilitary life, 
HAVING finifhed his meditations, he went 
out to a number of his officers, who at- 
tended at the entrance of his tent. His beha- 
viour on this occafion iliewed the mafterly ad- 
drefs with which he purfued his private fcheme; 
To his own countrymen he fpoke with the ut- 
moft indifference ; and giving them fome gene^ 
ral orders about the duties of the camp, difmified 
them fliffhtly, and with an appearance of dif- 
efteem. But to the foreigners by whofe fovereiga 
he was employed, he carried himfelf in quite a 
different manner. His eye wore a fmile of fa- 
miliarity and complaifance, whenever it met 
the meaneft fubaltcrn of the corps 3 and he fcru-

pled not to compliment therti, at the expence of 
the reft of the army, by propofmg their exam- 
ple to general imitation. 
So flattering a preference had the defigned 
effe6l ; the fatigues and dan2;ers by which they 
acquired it were immediately forgot ; and they 
even appeared eager to undertake more, to fup- 
port fo diftinguifhed an honour. 
The general faw with fecret pleafure the 
ardour with which he had inflamed them; and 
relolved he would not let it cool, for want of 
employ ment. Advancing to their particular 
commander, who juft then joined him, '"^ M^f 
*^ dear friend, (faid he, with an air of the molt 
" cordial efteem) I have this moment received 
" fome intelligence, that enables .me to give 
" your brave countrymen an opportunity of 
'^ %nallzing that valour v/hlch has eftabliflied 
" them in the exalted reputation of being the 
*' befl: foldiers in theuniverie. You will fele6l 
iive thoufand whom you thi<ik moft proper, 
and let them be ready to march an hourbe- 
bre night. When you return from doing 
" that, we will concert our meafures, and fix 
" on a perfon to carry them Into execution. It 
*' is a mafter-ilroke, and will do honour to any 
*' officer J for I cannot doubt of the fuccefs of 
" an enterprize undertaken by your gallant 
*' countrymen." 
The oiScer, who free from deceit himfelf, 
fufpc6i:ed none in any body elfe, heard him Vv^Ith 
the higheft joy, and glownng with a pafSon for 
glory, v/hich the general thus artfully fann'd, 
refolved, without even waiting to know the na- 
ture of the attempt, to take the command him- 
felf, and fo reap all the honour. " YourHigh-

" fhall not have any occafion for feledling, 
" where all are equally good, and equally am- 
" bitious of meriting your approbation. As 
*' for an officer for the command, i believe I 
*' can find one to whom, I hope, your High- 
" nefs will have no Gbje<Slion." 
Saying this, he proceeded directly to get every 
thing ready, while the reft of the army, inilead 
of being offended at having the poll: of honour 
thus partially given from them, hugged them- 
felves in the cafe and fafety th^y enjoyed by the 
difgrace. 
'Fhere was fomethijig fo ftriking in the rca- 
dlnefs with which the officer cat^licd at the bait 
that was laid for him, that I became fome-how 
anxious for the e\'ent, and refolved to obferve 
him particularly through the aitair; and there- 
fore follov/ed him, when he v/ent to give the 
neceffary orders to his men. 
If I had been furprif^d at the ardour he 
ihewed, I was ir;nnitely more fo, to find that

ftore their ftrength to any degree of equality 
with their fpirit. 
Among men aftuated by fuch an emulation, 
the leaft preference muft have bred envy, and 
been attended with difagreeable confequences^ 
Senfible of this, the officer thanked them ail, 
in the mod engaging manner for their readi- 
nefs ; but faid, that, according to the indifpen- 
fible rule of military difcipline, he muft necef- 
farily take thofe vvhofe duty came in turn, con- 
foling the reft with the thought that they could 
not long want an opportunity equally glorious 
of proving their fpirit in an army, where they 
were honoured by the general, with fo peculiajr 
a preheminence. 
This delicate aftair being adjufted, the heroes 
whofe happy fortune it was to go prepared 
themfelves with the higheft emulation, while 
the others drew oft' in evident deje6tion at their 
difappointment. 
As their leader rode along the lines, to take 
a particular view of them, I obferved that he 
addrefled one of his fubalterns, and was an- 
fwered by him in a ftrain of familiarity, that 
feemed inconfiftent vAth the diftance between 
their ftations. " Well Tom^ (faid the former, 
** with a fmile) this is a fudden call. How

*' longer time to reconcile her to the military 
*' life, before fhe is left by herfelf in a camp."

tion not eafy to be defcrlbed. Educated in the 
lap of luxury, fhe had multiplied the wants of 
nature ten-thoufand-fold ; and required aflift- 
ance every moment for neceffities created by 
caprice. Though her lover's fortune placed 
her above the real diftrefTes of fuch a place, 
and fupplied her with moft of the convenien- 
cies, as well as all the necefTaries of life, (he 
had numberlefs artificial occafions, which habit 
had made in a manner indifpenfible to her, and 
which, as it was impoflible to provide for then, 
in fuch a vague unfettled ftate, fhe exerted as 
much contrivance to fupply, as had firft enabled 
human ingenuity to find out the moft important 
conveniencies of life ; though with this elTen- 
tial difference, that as the end v/as fantaftic 
here, the means neceflarily appeared ridiculous. 
We found her at her toilet, which was a 
fiimpter-trunk, fet upon one end, and covered 
with a foul fhirt. On this flie had placed a 
pocket- mirrour, and on each fide of that a row 
of phials, and gallipots filled with colours, 
cofmetic pafte and wafhes which fhe always 
carried about her. Her combs and brufhes were 
fet out on the faucers fhe had juft been ufmg 
for breakfaft. Her fhoes and ftockings lay on . 
the bed, which was alfo her feat ; and to wafli 
herfelf, fhe made ufe of an utenfil, v*^hich had 
been placed under it for another occafi,on. With 
this apparatus, all fet in form, flie was as atten- 
tively bufy at the important v/ork of drefling, as 
if fhe was going to make her appearance at a 
drawing-room. Her lover's entrance inter- 
rupted her. " Fie, Damon^ (faid fhe, blufhlng

The moment I faw her, I could perceive that 
this gaiety was all affed^ed ; that, ficlc at heart,^ 
fhe ^cw to levity for relief from the torture of 
refledion. Such a ruin was fufEcient to raiie 
companion in any mind not utterly loft to every 
fenfe of humanity, as well as virtue. She v/as 
juft entered into the prime of life ; her form ele- 
oant and ftriking ; and her features, if not 
faultlefsly beautiful, yet glowing with fuch luxu- 
riant health, fuch animated fenfibility, as had 
the efFea: of the moft perfc6l beauty. But 
in her prefent fituation, all thefe charms ap- 
peared to difadvantage. A gloom of confcious 
guilt overcaft her fmiies ; and^amidft all her 
mirth and endearments, fhe was afliamed to 
look up, and meet the eye of the very author 
of her ihame. 
When Ihe had forced out the laugh with 
which file concluded the above fpeech, her 
Damon, fmiling with an air of indifference, 
" Neceffity is the mother of invention, my dear 
" Chioe; (faidhe) and yours feemstohave been 
" well fet to work. But I come to tell you fome 
" news that I fear will interrupt you. I am 
" ordered out upon adion diredly ; and as it 
" is like to be a warm aftair, I think it is bet- 
" ter to provide for your fafety before I go, 
" for fear of any thing's happening to me. 
" You would be horridly at a lofs by your- 
" fclf, in fuch a place as this, if I fhould be 
" killed." 
She ilarted at the mention of a6lion ; but his 
laft

Jaft words ftruck her with terrors too ftrong- 
for her to bear. For fome moments fhe flood 
like the ftatue of horror, unable to move or 
fpeakj KlitJier very fears at length gave her ut- 
terance. '^"Gocd heaven ! (exclaimed fhe) What 
" dofyou mean ? What action can you be or- 
dered into that fhould endanger your life ? 
Did you not promife me, that you would 
quit this accurfed life diredlly ? Did you not 
prevail upon me to come here with you, on- 
ly that you might lay dov/n your commifTion 
without difrcpute ?. You cannot, fhall not, 
think of going into any adlion ! You mufl 
come away this m.oment." 
*'That was my defign, my dear, if it 
had- not been for this unlucky affair ; but 
now it is impofTible for metoflir. If 1 re- 
turn, I will that moment lay down ; but I 
cannot pofTibly do it fooner. It would be 
an eternal blot upon my honour." 
" Honour ! (returned flie, with a figh^ 
that feemed to burft her heart) How can you 
mention that word to me ? If you are refolved 
to go, I will wait the event here. Should 
you be brought back wounded, my care may 
not be unnecefTary ! If worfe fhould happen, 
the horrors I fliall fuffer till I receive the 
account, will compleat my averfion to life, 
and make me glad to follow you. I have 
now no bufmefs in this world without you." 
The agony in which fhe faid this would have 
melted any other heart; but he felt it not... 
Finding her proof to this argument, he there- 
fore had recourfe to his laft expedient. " I am. 
*' much obliged to you, my dear, (faid he, quite 
'* unmoved) for your kind intentions to take

*^ care of me; but I hope I fhall not. want it. 
" Befide, there is another thing, which embar- 
" raflc's me a o-ood deal. I have iuft received 
*' an account, that my wife, out of her exam- 
*' plary love and duty, has accepted my invi- 
*' tation, and is coming to us dire6lly." 
" l^o us ! (anfwered fhe, alarmed almofl to 
"diflraaion) Is it poiTible ? What fhall we do? 
" Where fhall I fly! I never can, never will fee 
*' her. I had rather die ten thoufand deaths, 
" than look her in the face." 
*' To be fure, I allow it mufl be rather 
*' aukward ; but the mifchief is, I cannot tell 
*' how you will avoid it, if j^ou flay here." 
— " You mufl write to her peremptorily, this

*' you intended, for fear fhe fliould.'*t?qt obey

— ** Aye ! but the worfl is, I don't know where

** would be fo grofs an abufe not to fee her, 
*' even after her undergoing the fatigue of fuch 
*' a journey, at my exprefs defire, that I can- 
" not avoid waiting for her. Decency at leaft 
*' mufl be obfcrved." 
' " Decency ! How can you infult me

" V/hy child, if you are determined to 
~'*' think fo, it is in vain to reafon with you. 
*' You fhall do juft as you pleafe ; either go 
*' or ftay. What I meant to propofe v/as this : 
" You remember your old friend, v/ho took a 
'' frolick with Ifi/l Buck two or three years 
" ago. She lives in a very pretty retired man- 
" ner, in a neutral town, about twenty miles 
*' from hence. Now, if you approve of it, it 
*' would be no bad fcheme for you, to go and 
*' pay her a^ vifit, till we fee how things go. I 
*' am fure ihe will be very well pleafed to fee 
" you ; and there you will be free from the in- 
*' conveniencies, and fafe from the dangers of 
*' a camp ; and near enough for me to flep to 
*' you as often as i can fpare a moment. I'll 
*^ write a letter to Will about it direftly ; and 
*' as I know his finances are not in the beft 
*' fituation, I make no doubt but he'll be very. 
" glad of your flaying there as long as you 
*' pleafe ; for you fhall have money enough, to 
'' bear all the expence. I would not let you 
*' be 
THE REVERIE. 2i 
'' be under obii ;ation to any one. Well, what 
*' think you of my fcheme ? Was It not a lucky 
" thought? You and jQie were very intimate 
" formerly, and \yill now be the mofl proper 
'' and agreeable companions for each other.'* 
It is impoflible to defcribe the different paf- 
fions which were painted in her face, while he 
was making this propofal. She knew him too 
well to take fuch a rational fcheme for a fud- 
dcn thought ; and concluded from thence, that 
he was fatiated with her company, and had 
forjned a premeditated defign to get rid of her ; 
to facilitate which he had firft made a pretence 
of his being ordered into a£tion, and when that 
did not take effe6l, forged this ftory of his wife's 
coming; for, notwithftanding her diftrefs, ihe 
had obllrved the many inconfiftencies in what 
he faid. However, her pride would npt permit 
her to difcover her fufpicions, as it would look 
like ftrivlng to force herfelf longer upon him. 
" When you are refolved, (anfwered fhe, 
*' with a mofl exprc/Hve look) I have nothing 
*' left but to obey. Give orders for my going, 
''f iliall foon be ready. All places are indif- 
*' ferent to me, and all companions equally dif- 
*■'' agreeable. iVly own thoughts will afford mc 
" company enough. I leave you to yours." 
" My deareft girl, (replied he, more pleafed 
at her compliance than affecled at the man- 
ner of it) what I proj^ofe is for the beft. I 
only fludy your convenience and fatisfa61ion. 
If you can think of any other way, I am rea- 
dy to do it." 
" I have no power to think ! I wifh I 
*' ne\'er could ! But let me be gone. I have 
'* llald too long already. Let me not interfere 
'' with 
%2 THE REVERIE. 
*' with your regard to decency and honour." 
-Saying this, {lie dire<3:ly huddled on her 
travelling habit, while he went to 'order his 
chaife to the door of his tent. 
When he had done this, he returned to give 
her fome neceflary inftruclions for her journey, 
and palliate the offence he had given her, by 
careffes and profellions of love and conilancy. 
She beared him with the moft contemptuous 
filence ; and taking a purfe of gold, which he 
gave her, with an air of indignation flung 
into the chaife the moment it arrived, without 
fpeaking a word, or making the leaft return to 
his fondnefs. 
The fpirit which fhe fhewed on this occa- 
fion was evidently raifed by refentm.ent ; and 
of courfe could not laft long. Indeed flie was 
fcarce able to fupport it till fhe got into the 
chaife, where (he melted into a flood of tears 
before fhe was out of fight. Her lover faw her 
diftrefs ; but the joy he felt at being freed from 
her company, prevented his feeling any con- 
cern at it. He fhrugged up his fhoulders in 
fclf-complacency ; and, hugging himfelf on his 
deliverance, prepared to attend his commander

THERE was fomething fo deliberately 
bale in the whole condu6l of this perfon, 
that I left him with the highcfl: cojitempt, and 
returned to his commander, who v/as by this 
time ready to wait upon the general to receive 
his orders. 
The moment he entered the tent, the gene- 
ral arofe, and, difmifTing every other perfon 
prefent, received him with the highell lefpedl. 
" Well, my friend, (faid he) I am now ready 
" to communicate to you the plan which I have 
" formed ; but it will be proper that the per- 
■" fon for whom you defign the honour of the 
" command, fhould be prefent." 
" He is prefent, if your highnefs makes no

" are formed with judgment ; and as your more 
" than ufual earneftnefs about this fhews it to 
*' be of importance, fhall be proud of having 
*' the execution of it entrufted to my care." 
" You, my friend ! I know not what 
*^' to fay; I cannot fpare you from my fide. I

^ " fame time, I am unwilling to rob you of 
" an opportunity of acquiring fo much glory.

" To you I give a difcretionary power, to a6t 
*' as you fee proper. Had I known you would 
'' have gone, I jChould not have drawn any par- 
" ticular diredlions. Go j and fuccefs await 
« you." 
The other received this diftinguifhed mark 
of confidence and favour with the higheft plea- 
fure ; and, taking leave of the general, haftened 
away to join his troops, who were by this time 
drawn out ready to march. As foon as he had 
taicen a view of them^ he opened his inflruc- 
tions ; and looking them over, put himfelf at 
the head of his men, with whom he marched all 
niffht, throup-h woods and morafles deemed im- 
paflible, and at day-break found himfelf juft be- 
fore a quarter of the enemy, who, confiding 
in the diftance and natural ftrength of their 
fituation, had neglected to fortify them- 
felves, and expected nothing lefs than to be 
ttiicked. 
The difficulties of the march had fatigued his 
troops to fuch a degree, that it appeared next 
to madnefs to let them attack an enemy great- 
ly fuperior to them in number. But their ar- 
dour was fuch, that they defpifed every advan- 
tage, and demanded to be inftantlyled on. The 
proper improvement of that enthufiafm is gene- 
rally decifive. The commander therefore in- 
dulged their impetuofity, coni-iding in their va- 
lour ; and convinced that his fafety and fuccefs 
equally depended upon furprize, if he failed of 
which, it would be abfclutely impofTible for him 
even to make a retreat in the condition they 
wer€

were in, through fuch difficulties as tliey had 
-flruggled v/ith in coming. 
Scenes like this are impoilible to be particu- 
larly defcribed. Accuftomed to conquer, they 
made their onfet with a refoluti®n that bore 
down all before them. In the confufion un- 
avoidable on fuch occafions, their enemies fled 
at the firft impulfe, imagining they were attack- 
ed by the whole army, while the .vidlors made 
an heavy /laughter of all who had no time to 
cfcape. 
Had they Hopped here, the advantage would 
have been important. But hurried on by their 
natural ardour, and fiuflicd befide with fnccefs, 
they purfued the fugitives, who.by this time had 
recovered from their firii furprize, and formed 
upon an eminence, not very far from their late 
camp. The action now was really dreadful. 
The afiailants were feveral times repulfed witii 
fevere lofs, and owed their fuccefs at lafi: to aa 
effort of meer defpair, being determined, to a 
man, to die rather than have their vi61:ory 
fnatchci thus out of their hands. 
Their lofs in this afFair equalled. that of their 
enemies, in. the furprize of their entrenchments, 
and amounted to more than half their number ; 
but they remained maflers of the field, the ho- 
nour of which they looked upon as a rccom- 
pence for all. 
On their return to the army the general ir\tt 
them, and em.bracing the leader, congratulated 
him on the glory of his victory; and thanking 
the men, in the orders of the day, fent them 
away happy ; v/hile he pleafed himfelf with the 
fuccefs of his fcheme, which gave him the ap- 
pearance of doing foniething, flattered his em-

his merit with them ; at the fame time, that in 
reahty it ferved rather to protradl than deter- 
mine the war, by infpiring each party with a 
defire of revenging fo equal a lofs. However, 
it was deemed ilifiicient by him to be made the 
fubje6l of congratulatory meflages to the fo- 
vereign under whom he ferved, and all the

I was fo lick of this mercenary method of 
making war, by which the miferies of that 
fcourge of mankind were fo highly aggravated, 
that 1 refolved to quit this army directly, and 
fee whether that of the enemy, oppofed to it, 
was conducted in a more rational manner. 
I have faid that my guide had given me 
power to tranfport myfelf, by a bare a6l of my 
will, wherever I pleafed. Though this was necef- 
ilitily a great advantage in many inftances, there 
were yet fomecircumilances attending it, which 
made mt chufe to decline making ufe of it, ex- 
cept upon extraordinary occafions. The in- 
ftantaneous tranfition from one fcene to another, 
diftant and unconnected, was fo unufual to me, 
that it left a chafni in my mind, and made me 
for fome time at a lofs to comprehend the things 
before me, for want of the introdudlion of en- 
terino* g-radually into them. This I had expe- 
1 1  
rienced more than once, when at any tnne my 
guide ufed to turn my eye fuddenly and without 
fome previous preparation, to any new fcene in 
the review I made under his Immediate dire6lion. 
For this reafon I refolved, when It was pofTible, 
to take the opportunity of accompanying fome 
perfon, wherever 1 had a mind to go, whofe bu- 
fmefs would ferve as a clue, to introduce and di- 
rect

method i had alTo the advantage of obferving 
feveral things worthy of notice, in the countries 
through which I pafl'ed, which would have 
efcaped me if I only flew over them in the other 
way. 
For fuch a guide and companion I was not 
long at a lofs. The general that very evening 
held a council of war, the refolutions of which 
two of the members could not refrain from 
talking over that night, after fupper. Not fuf- 
pe6ling that they w^ere overheard, they can- 
valil'd all that had palled very freely, and in the 
courfe of their converfation mentioned feveral 
matters of the greatefl: importance to be kept fe- 
cret. This the valet de chambre of him in whofc 
tent they were was not inattentive to. He was 
a native of the enemy's country, and^ retained 
by them to procure intelligence of every thing 
that happened in the army where he was. Ac- 
cordingly he placed himfclf where he could dif- 
tini?l:ly hear all that v/as faid ; and pretending 
fleep, to avoid the danger of dcte£lion, liilened 
to their difcourfe with the greatell attention. 
As foon as they feparated, and he had put 
his mafler to bed, he wrote an exa61: account 
of all that he had over-heard ; and giving 
his letter to one of his aflbciates, who paiTed for 
no more than a coirmon purveyor to the camp, 
charged him to deliver it as directed, with the 
utmoft expedition, as it was of the highefl im- 
portance ; and this experienced perfon I re- 
Iblved to accompany.

■^ H E armies lay fo near each other that my 
guide might Ibon have performed his er- 
rand, could he have gone diredlly vi^ith fafety. 
Inftead of that, to avoid every fufpicion, he took 
diametrically the contrary way, defigning, when 
he fhould be out of danger of being obferved, to 
make a turn, and go by a fafer though more dif- 
tant courfe. 
I fnall not attempt to defcribe the country 
through which we travelled. Could the mofl am- 
bitious power that ever waged a war view fuch 
a fcene with the difpafiionate eye of reafon but 
for one moment, it would ftrike his heart with 
horror, and make him defift from purfuits fode- 
flru6live to his kind. 
The iirft place we flopped at happened to be 
the tov/n to which the officer had fent his mif- 
trefs, as I have faid before, under a pretext of 
her avoiding his wife. I fliould have taken no- 
tice, that in the courfe of the a£i:ion he had 
often repented of not taking her advice, and 
wifned himfelf to be in fafety with her; though 
when it v/as over, his heart exulted fo much in 
the fuccefs, that for fome time he could think 
of nothing but war and glory. Indeed his be- 
haviour had been fuch as in a great meafure re-

covered the efteem of his leader ; and with the 
reft of the army, who have a partiality for the 
indulgence of pa/lion, and are particularly fmit- 
ten with the more fliewy virtues, totally obli- 
terated his reproach. 
As we entered the town, I accidentally faw 
her at a window, and my fellow-traveller flop- 
ping for refrefhment, I took that opportunity to 
fee how fhc liked her prefentfituation. AV'hen 
I joined her, fhe and her friend were going to 
take a walk in their garden. 
There was fomething particularly flriking in 
the appearance of the latter. Tho' Ihe had never 
been a regular beauty, and now had loft a good 
deal of the bloom of youth, it was impoflible for 
man to behold her without defire ; at the fame 
time, that the fire which flaflied from her eyes 
fhe wed that fhe felt all the paiTions fhe infplrcd. 
A nmilarity in their circumftances had very foon 
improved their former acquaintance into that 
degree of intimacy which is commonly called 
friendfhip. When they were feated in an ar- 
bour at the bottom of the garden, "I wonder, 
*' madam, (faid the ladyof the houfe) that you 
*' have had no account from your friend, lince 
" this adlion. Public report lays it was \ery 
" warm; but as no particular mention is made

" vity that rules all his anions. I am out of

" But 1 have no right to complain. I dcferve

ftancy itfelf. My eyes are at length opened 
to my folly. I deferve to be (lighted thus,  
aiid deferted in a ftrange place." 
^' Have patience, dear madam ! Do not 
feek for imaginary grievances. It is impof- 
fible he can defer't you. No man can be fo 
infennble as to flight fuch charms. The hur- 
ry of v/ar is above our conception, and often 
prevents the performance of the duties deareil 
to the heart." 
'' O my friend ! you are too good ta- . 
fcek confolation for a wretch juft finking 
into defpair. But it is all in vain. What 
bufincfs had he with war ? His fortune placed 
hini above the common motive of neceffity ; 
and he afiiired me that he was fick of the 
folly of ambition, and would retire to fome 
private place in Italy, where we fhould be un- 
known, and there dedicate his life to \ov& 
and happlnefs. But no fooner had he ob- 
tained his bafe ends than he changed his 
fcheme ; and feigning I know not what rea- 
foiis about layirig down his commifiion with 
credit, and fuch idle fluff, he led me hither, 
juft tc ihcw me about, and jnake the fhame 
of my being cafl off the more notorious and 
mortifying, perhaps to enhance its merit, 
and prepare the way for a reconciliation with 
his wife, which his writing her that letter 
gives me fuificient ground to think he is not 
without thoughts of."

through J for idlenefs, my dear friend, is the 
bane of woman, let her attribute her failings to 
whatever other apparent caufe fhe will. 
" The mofl important part of my ftory may 
be comprifed in a few words. You are ac- 
quainted with my family, and the particular 
circumftances of it, which made my fituation 
more critically dangerous even than that of the 
generality of my fex ; a danger that was ftili 
heightened by other circumftances peculiar to 
my feH, and which, far from being attended tO; 
in that light, and gtlirded agalnft- with proper 
care, were looked upon as advantages, and ac^ 
cordingly urged to their utmoft force. 
*' Born in a rank that placed all the pleafures. 
of life within my reach, and bleffed with a con- 
ftitution equal to the enjoyment of them, I 
feemed marked out for the attacks of man ; the 
luxuriance of my health kindling allthepaflions 
of nature, before reafon could gather ftrength to 
guide and keep them within proper bounds, and 
the liberties allowed by faihion giving every op- 
portunity for their gratification. Such an apti- 
tude for pleafure. was alfo forwarded, where it 
fhould have met with reftraint.

whom makes refpeaful mention of them a du- 
ty, be their conducSl what it wil] . I fhall there- 
fore only fay that, inftead of inftilling the prin- 
ciples of virtue by precept, and enforcing its 
praaice by example, that perfcn, whofe exam- 
p]e_ and precepts mull have had the greateft 
weight with me, exerted them quite the contra- 
ry way, turning every thing ferious into ridi- 
cule, and indulging every licentious pafTion in 
the moft public manner. The conl'equence, 
-with regard to me,, may be eafily.cojicluded! . 
Inclined by nature to pleafure, I willingly imi- 
tated the pattern fct me as far as was in my 
power, and launched into every excefs, as op- 
portunity tempted ; and if I paid greater reo;ard  
to appearances,, and conduded "myfelf with 
more referve, it was not from any reftraint of 
principle; but becaufe I faw that fafhion did 
not authorife the fame boundlcfs liberty in . 
youth, as it did in more advanced life. 
" But this referve foon began to be very un- 
eafy to me, and the plcafurcs I enjoyed, to be 
confined within narrower limits than I liked. 
Ripened, as I have ilud, by the luxuriance of 
my conftitution, I felt all the warmeft paflions 
of my fex before it was imagined that my ten- 
der youth was capable of fuch fenfations, and  
was treated like a child long after I thou^^ht 
myfelf a woman. The difficulties this laid me 
u^ider were often very didigreeable. I made 
every explanation that \\'as riot a direct breach 
of decency, and gave hints which would have 
been readily underftood from anyone of a more 
advanced age. But, to my fevere mortification, , 
all was attributed to nicer imitation 3 and Mifss

was fignlficantly faid to echoe her mama's 
words, when (he would much rather have prac- 
tifed her adiions. 
" At length, however, I was relieved from 
this teazing lituation, by one of thofe accidents 
which determine the fate of human life. As I 
, was fitting one evening at an afTembly, fretting 
myfelf to death to fee feveral ladies, whom i 
looked upon as my inferiors in every thing but 
age, taken out before me, an officer, who read 
my thoughts and was refolved to have fome 
amufement with me, came up to the place where 
I fat, and entering into chat with a young lady 
who was with me, led her to afk him if he did 
not deiign to dance; upon which, turning to 
me with an air of the moO: refpedlful politenels, 
he anfwered that he would, if I would do him 
the favour to be his partner. 
"Such a preference, though to one of my 
moft intimate acquaintances, for the manner in 
which file had afkedthequeftion was a plain of- 
fer to dance with him herfelf, was too pleafmg 
to be flighted. I aflented moft readily, and in 
the height of my fpirits at my triumph, gave 
fuch plain hints of the ftate of my inclinations,, 
that he foon comprehended them ; and being 
fomewhat warm with wine, m.ade advances to 
me which I had long wifhed for, but never re- 
ceived before. 
" The impreffion made upon us by a firft ap- 
plication is hard to be refifted. For my part, I 
was too much pleafed with it to make the at- 
tempt; and really feeling all that warmth he 
profefTed, met his wilhes more than half way. 
In fuch a life as I led, and to perfons fo difpo- 
fed, opportunity could not long be wanted;

but when my lover came in a cooler moment to 
reflect: on the confequences of an intrigue with 
one of my age and rank, fhould it ever happen 
to be difcovered, prudence damped the ardour 
of his paffion, and prevented his carrying the 
conqueil he had made to the height of our mu- 
tual dcfn-es. But though he deferred it for the 
prefent, he did not abfolutely give up the de- 
lign, when circumifances fhould wear a more 
favourable afpe£l. 
" In families like ours, every perfon who 
drc/Tcd well and would play had ready admif- 
fion. He availed^himfelf of this, and, under the 
appearance of paying a compliment to my mo- 
ther, took every opportunity of attendino- me to^ 
all places of pleafurable ref Tt.. 
. "^ The difference of our age, and particular- 
ly his being married, obviated every fufpicion of 
his intentions, as they fliould have opened my 
eyes to the infamy and folly cf carrying on fuch 
a correfpondencc. But I was incapable of con- 
iidering any thing befide thepleafurel felt in his 
company, which was evidently fo-fincere that, 
beyond his defign, it afFeded him, and he begaa 
alfo to feel the pafTion he had cnlyprofeiTed "be-

'^ Though he conducted himfelf with the ut- 
moft circumf eilion and addrefs, it was impof- 
fible to keep up fuch an intercourfe long with- 
out the real motive of it being fufped^ed. The 
firfl hint of this alarmed the pride of mv rela- 
tions, though the original caufe had not been 
thought worthy of their regard. They inflantly 
aflailedmewithexpoftulationsand reproaches, as 
they did my lover with menaces; but all in vain.

difcover a fufpicion of what it is not abfolutely 
in our power to prevent. It takes ofF the re- 
ftraint of fhame, and raifes a falfe refentment 
that urges the crime in revenge of the injurious 
accufation. Inftead of working the effect my 
friends defigned, this condu6t onlyhaftened the 
confequence which they meaned to hinder. 
Finding they could not themfelves break ofF' 
the intercourfe between us, though they knew 
not certainly to what length it had been carried, 
they had recourfe to fuperior authority, and 
prevailed to have my lover fent on an expedi- 
tion, from which it was more than probable 
that he would never return ; or at leaft if he 
did, it muft be after fuch a length of time as they 
doubted not would wean my affeftions from him,, 
and fix them on fome other more proper obje6l.. 
" But all their fchemes were difappointed. 
The expedition mifcarried, and he returned be- 
fore they imagined he had even reached the place - 
of his deftination ; and far from being cooled in ; 
our mutual regards by abfence, they rather 
gathered ftrength to break out with greater vio- 
lence. 
'* P'or fome time, however, we obferved fo , 
much caution, as to fave appearances at leaft, . 
let fufpicions be what they would. But a garde- 
ner furprifmg us one evening in an arbour, , 
when we thought ourfelves fafe from obferva- 
tion, though the fellow was highly bribed to 
fecrecy, we thought it imprudent to depend 
upon him ; my lover therefore threw up his 
commiffion, and we immediately eloped to- 
gether out of the reach of my friends refent- 
\ ment, who, v/e were v/ell convinced, would 
j_^;, leave nothing undone to be revenged on the

man who had thrown fuch a public fcandal on 
their family. 
" I now thought my happlnefs compleat, 
and, giving a loofe to love, defpifcd the cen- 
fure of the world, and looked no farther than 
the prefejit moment. But a little time made 
a change in my fentiments, and I bejxan to 
languifli for the other pleafures which I had 
forfeited by the ftep I had taken. 
*' I would not by this intimate any uncom- 
mon alteration in my lover's behaviour; but 
the joy of novelty was worn off, defire was fa- 
tisfied, and refledion began to obtrude upon 
us. Our fituation neceilarily precluded us from 
fociety, at Icait any that could afford us fatis- 
fadlion, and confined us to each other ; and 
when the tumult of pafRon began to fubllde, as. 
we dared not apply to reafon for relief, time 
grew tedious, and we mutually fighed for va- 
riety, to give a relifh even to pleafure. The 
effe^l: this had upon our tempers heightened our 
imhappincfs. Unable to look into ourfelves 
for the real caufe, each accufed the other of in- 
tonftancy and want of love; and thefe re-^ 
proaches, inilead of removing the complaint, 
were beginning to aggravate a coolnefs that 
was unavoidable, into determined diflike and 
averfion : for, my dear, let us in the warmth 
of youthful imagination flatter ourfelves with 
what notions we will of eternal conftancy and 
unalterable love, fenfe will foon be fated and 
kngiiifh for, variety, if reafon does not lend its 
affiibnce to fill up the dull paufe of paffion.

"T HAVE obferved to you that my lover 
J. had no fortune j all his hopes even depend- 
ing on his military profefjion. The manner 
in which he had come away with me cutting 
off thefe for ever in his own country, neceffity 
obliged him to feek employment among ilrang- 
ers. This the tumult of my thoughts had 
made me overlook, at the time when it was in 
my power to have prevented the confequences 
of it. But think what a Hate I muft have been 
in when the hour of his departure came I I look 
back to it with horror even now when ufe has 
made his abfence familiar to me, and foftened 
many of the inconveniences of it. 
" Without the converfation of a friend, to 
beguile the tedious melancholy hours, and blunt 
the fting of grief ; without the approbation of 
my own mitid, to fweeten thought and make 
refle61:ion a pleafure, I was left a ftranger in 
a ftrange place; 'and, what was ftill worft of 
all, every morfel I eat imbittered by the dread-

ful confideration, that it was earned at the Inflant 
hazard of the life dcareft to me in the world ; 
for the firft thought of our parting removed all 
that wearinefs which had been the caufe of our 
difguft, and the occafion of it doubly endeared 
us, by fhewing how much we had given up, 
how much more we hazarded for each other. 
" Our parting exceeded the power of de- 
fcription. After the firft tranfports of my grief 
were over, I funk into a ftate of infenfibility, 
and grew abfolutcly indifferent to myfelf and 
every thing about me, fixing my thoughts en- 
tirely on the days which were to bring me an 
account from him, and living only for their ar- 
rival. 
" At length lenient time began to adminlfter 
its never-failing relief; and youth and health 
united their powers to diflipate a gloom fo con- 
trary to my natural difpofition ; I gradually 
recovered my fpirits, and felt again a relifh 
for the pleafures of fociety. But thefe plea- 
fures were very different from thofe which I 
had formerly delighted in. My mind had learned 
to think, and I had had time to view things in 
another light from that in which they had ap- 
peared before. My affedlions, it is true, were 
ftill the fame, invariably fixed upon my friend, 
and all the wifties of my heart centered in him ; 
how juftly though I did not dare to confider, 
holding every thing that concerned him too fa- 
cred to be even enquired into. 
" Thefe wiflies indeed were of a much more 
extenlive and exalted kind, than thofe which 
had given rife to our connexion. You may

From this time, I looked upon him in th*t 
light i

light ; and if not entirely in that alone, the ve- 
ry uniting the idea of friendfhip with love was 
the higheft improv^ement to the latter, and in a 
great meafure purified it from every grofs allay. 
" The effe6t this had upon my mind is fcarce 
to be conceived. I was not incapable of thought ; 
but I had never given myfelf time to think. 'J he 
moment therefore that 1 began, I found a plea- 
sure in it which cannot be conceived ; every 
hour brouo;ht me knowledge that made mcboth 
iurprifed at, and afnamed of my former blind- 
nefs and ignorance ; I read in my own mind, 
thotigh unhappily too late, all the wifdom ne- 
cefTary for the condudl of life. I thus literacy 
became a new creature ; and on my emerhon 
from the folitude in which 1 had buried myfelf 
fmce my friend's departure, fought the compa- 
ny (and flatter myfelf that I was not unworthy 
of it) of the moft valuable part of my fex. 
"But I foon had the mortification to find 
myfelf precluded from this pleafmg hope. Re- 
tired and unexceptionably as we had lived, the 
circumftances of our elopement had fome how 
been difcovered ; fo that when I appeared in" 
company, inftead of meeting the reception I 
had fondly expelled, my advances toward inti- 
macy were repulfed by my own fex, and I found 
myfelf expofed to the familiarity and libertine 
addrefles of the other, who always lay it down 
as a rule, that a woman who has broken thro* 
the laws of virtue with one man, has entirely 
thrown off all farther regard to them, and is a 
fair quarry for general purfuit. 
" You may eafdy judge what a (hock this 
was to me. I now began to feel the ineftima- 
ble lofs of reputation, and returned to my 
former.

former retirement with an heart burfting with 
difappointment, (hame, and remorrc. But I was 
jiot fuffered long to enjoy the peace I fought 
even there. My new admirers purfued me, and 
in fpite of all I could fay perfifted in their gal- 
lantry; and that often in a manner too grofs to 
have becii offered to any but a profelled pro- 
iHtute. 
" Had this happened fome time fooner, I 
fhould have inftantly written to my friend, to 
come to my relief from fuch infolent abufc ; but 
my thoughts had now taken a new turn, and I 
dreaded nothing more than its coming to his 
knowledge, for fear of any ill confequ'ences to 
himfelf from the warmth of his temper, which 
J knew would be provoked to the higheft rage 
at fuch an attempt. For this reafon I refolved 
to take no notice of it to him, but behave in 
fuch a manner to my admirers as fliould make 
them ridiculous even in^heir own eyes. 
" Habits long confirmed are noteafily broken 
through by the bcfl refolutions. 1 had a na- 
tural levity of temper; and the critical nature 
of my intercourfe with my friend before our 
elopement, laid me under a kind of neceflityof 
pra;?tifing coquetry in my general condu^Sb, in 
hopes of covering nay particular connc(5tion with 
him. I will therefore take fliame to myfelf, 
and confefs that in my prefent folitary condi- 
tion, the profpe6l of amufement, in playing ofF 
their foolifli addreifes, had fome weight with 
me in this defign ; never confidering that fuch 
a condu6t was inconfillent with the principles 
in which I now prided myfelf, and mufl inevi- 
tably difappoint my hopes of recovering the 
ellcem 
44 THE REVERIE. 
cfteem of the prudent and virtuous of my own> 
and rational part of the other fex. 
" I fee you are afFefted with this melancho^ 
ly detail ; but my heart was fo full, that I could 
not ftop its overflowing. I fhall now conclude 
with one of the many adventures which this 
new fcheme of mine produced, the oddity of 
which will probably reftore you to fpirits. 
" The perfons who thought proper to do me 
the honour of declaring themfelves my admir- 
ers were of every age and rank in the place. 
As they had difcovered the nobility of my birth, 
'they all thought it incumbent upon them to 
difplay their utmoft politenefs in the manner of 
making their addrefies. Though every country 
has peculiar cuftoms which conftitute the rule 
of behaviour, true politenefs is eflentially the 
fame every- where, and differs only in the ex- 
ternal modes of expreffing it. The mechanical 
part, as I may juftly call it, which confifts in 
cringes" and compliments, may be eafily learn- 
ed; but the unembarrafTed eafe and proper free- 
dom of addrefs and deportment, which deno- 
minate the charadter at firft fight, and that de- 
lire to give pleafure, which pleafes in its very 
appearance, muft have a foundation from na- 
ture, in a benevolent and generous difpofition, 
and be confirmed by early education and long 
pradtice. The latter indeed may give an habit 
that fhall deceive a fuperficial view ; but v/here 
the former is v/anting, the judicious obferver 
will foon difcover and defpife the impofture. 
*' I had abundant experience of the juftice of 
this remark in the behaviour of my new ad^ 
mirers. Had I had nothing more than meer 
common amufement in my thoughts, this would 
have

"have afforded me fufficient ; but refentment j^t 
their impudence made me determined to puih 
their folly to its utmoft length, and then expofe 
it to public ridicule. 
" The few who really poffeffed that polite- 
iiefs which all aped, foon perceived, by the man- 
ner of my receiving their advances, that they 
were difagreeable to me, and accordingly de- 
fined from giving me any farther trouble. But 
their aukward imitators in the externals of good- 
breeding, formijig their judgment of me from 
themfelves, conftrued my complaifance into ap- 
probation, and thought I waspleafed with what 
they faid, becaufe I did not dire6lly fly into an 
outrage ; but when I had taken time to look 
into their characters, and fee which was fitteft 
for my purpofe to work upon, I gave the reft 
their difmiffion, in the manner moft like to take 
effea. 
^ Among the felected few whom I permitted 
to flatter themfelves with hopes of fuccefs was 
an old burgher, who had made an immenfe for- 
tune by every iniquitous pradice in the myfte- 
rious bufmefs of a co7itra£ijr^ for fupplying the 
armies of the powers at war with provisions. 
Though he Was fprung from the very dregs of 
mankind, and had palled his youth in the moft 
fordid and fervile employments, his heart was 
fo puffed up by his riches, that he muff on all 
occafions affume the man of birth and good 
breeding. This his own bafe difpofition made 
it impoffible for him to do in any thing befide 
their follies and vices, in all of which he made 
a moft remarkable figure. He built fine houfes, 
he bought pictures, he gamed ; and, to complcat 
his charader, he muff now have a miftrefs of 
quality j 
46 THE REVERIE. 
quality % and I, forfooth, was the happy object 
he had pitched upon for this honour. 
"I fhould have obferved, that as foon as he 
took it into his head to commence a man of 
iigure, he had married a wife, whofe whole 
fortune confifted in the nobility of her family, 
being defcended in the ninth remove from a 
German baron, and none of her illuftrious an-- 
ceftors having itained their blood by any kind 
of induftry. 
" Before he could obtain fuch an honour, ht 
was obliged to hire an herald to deduce his pe- 
digree, by the eafy means of changing only four 
letters in his name, from an equally illuftrious 
houfe ; and to turn an only daughter by a former 
wife, whofe induftry had been greatly alTiftant 
to his making his fortune, out of doors, withr 
out any provilion more than a bare fupport from 
abfolute v/ant. 
" The difpofition that could demand, fuch 
terms was far from being foftcned, when its ty- 
ranny was confirmed by marriage. She go- 
verned in the moft defpotic manner. He was 
obliged to quit bufinefs. His fortune was la- 
vifhed upon her relations, who let him know 
they thought him honoured by their acceptance 
of it ; and he was but a cypher in his own 
houfe, where every fervant quoted her command 
fordlfputinghis authority, and told him directly 
that he was not qualified to give directions in 
fo genteel a family. 
" In fuch a fituation it v/as not flrange that 
he fhould feek for fatisfaCljon abroad ; but even 
in this his defign was confident with the reft of 
his conduft, and very different from what might 
moft naturally be imagined. Infignificant as 
he

he was at home, he gave himfelf the highest 
airs of poUtenefs and confequence among hb 
companions, where he was lafe from the terror 
of his tyrant's power, to confirm his title, to: 
which chara6ler, as I have faid before, he 
formed the project of paying his adJreiles ta 
me, not from any particular paffion he had 
for me.

^* Though I had ftudied my part very welly 
I was fomewhat difconcerted at fuch an ad-

minutes, I was rather diverted than offended 
at the oddity of it, and refolved to drive the 
bargain, as he juftly called it, in his own 
way. Accordingly I anfwered him with an 
afFe6led confufion, that I did not rightly un- 
derftand what he meant. 
<' Madam, (replied he) my meaning is to —

"Come! Don't ftand fhilly Ihally ! Say! Is

" It was impoffible for me to pretend igno-

fear it fhould make him think flightly of my

that expecStation and anxiety which to minds of 
more delicacy are the food of love.

ing this, my lover took his leave, and left me 
not a little at a lofs how to manage with 
him. 
" As I was no flrangcr to the circumftances 
of his family, the firft thought that occurred 
to me was, to reveal the whole to his wife, and 
concert meafures with her for punifliing his infi- 
delity and prefumpticn. But, upon refleLlion, 
I enlarged my fcheme, and refolved to try if I 
could not turn his ridiculous paffion to fome ad- 
vantage for his defcrted daughter, before I gave 
him up to her chaftifement. 
" Accordingly I went dire6lly to a lady with 
whom 1 knew Ihe was acquainted, and enquir-

cumflances and chara6ler, had the pleafure to

Tne burfl into a flood of tears ; and, as foon as 
ihc was able to fpeak, told me modeflly, thai: 
ihc had no profpedls, and w^as incapable of 
forming any defigns ; that indeed the height of 
Jier wiflies would be to be married to a young 
jTian who had been bred to bufmefs under her fa-

<loning her in the manner he did, they could 
not think of tranfmitting their mdsfortunes to 
their innogent pofterity by marrying; and there- 
fore had vowed to each other to live fmgle, as 
the only [:roof they could give of the lincerity 
of their mutual attachment, 
'^ i was not proof to fuch a ftory. I embraced 
her tenderly; and alTurino: her of my friend-

that if they had about a thoufand crowns to add 
to fome little matter they had already made a 
fnift to lay up by their frugality, they would 
venture, and trufi the event to the bleiling of

fum than that ; but that all depended on her 
not taking the leafl notice of her having been 
with me, or even mentioning my name to any

I therefore wrote to his daughter, to come to- 
me that night about eleven o'clock, and bring 
her lover with her. The great difficulty now 
was how to open the affair to the wife, in fuch

*' A LL things being thus prepared, the ex^ 
jTjL pe6led hour at length arrived when I at- 
tended to admit my gallant, who did not make 
me wait long. On my opening the garden- 
door^ I was furprifed to fee the manner in which 
he had difguifed himfelf. He had put on an 
€jld .fuit of eloaths all over dawb'd with, lace, 
which had belonged half a century before to a 
relation of his wife's, whom the tradition of hex 
fiimily recorded to have been a general officer ;.

figure in the eyes of his miflrefs, to mind any 
thing eife; as 1 was far from being difpleafedat 
it, my motive for defiring him to difguife him- 
felf being only to expofe him to flronger ridi-

iiiould efcape.

" As fooii he entered the garden, liis firit 
care was to make me obferve the brilliancy ,oi 
his appearance, by telling me that according fo 
my defire he had come in difguifc, but could 
not poflibly debafc himfelf, or difhonourme fo 
much as to put on any dref« unworthy of his- 
rank, or improper to appear in before me. I 
thanked him for my fharc of his compliment;, 
and being apprehenfive that he might be for 
taking fome liberties which I did not likc^ if I 
made any delay there, led him direclly up to my 
own chamber, where I left him in the dark, 
telling him I would return as foon as I faw my 
fervants properly difpofed of.^ 
. " I then went down into the parlour, where 
my confederate had juil: brought liis wife, big. 
with expe6lation of hearing fomething from me 
that nearly concerned her honour. Few words 
were requifite to introduce a fubjC(5l whicli all 
were equally impatient for. I directly uiifoldcd 
to her the injullice deilgned to her bed ; (the 
affair of the money I thought proper not to 
mention for obvious reafons) and telling her, 
that having in vain tried every argument to get 
rid of his importunity, and C(^'nvince him of the 
flagrancy of fuch a cri;ne againfr a-lady of her 
rank, 1 had at length pretended to comply with 
his defires, on. purpofe to give him .up to her 
admonitions and authoritv, v/hich I hoped might 
be more effcclual to reclaim hiui ; and there-

convulled with rage. At length recovering her- 
felf a little, fhewas for going diredtly and tramp- 
ling the wretch under her feet; but her friend 
interpofed, and infniuating, as we had concert- 
ed, that though what I faid might poffibly be 
very true, it would yet be a fatisfa6tion to the 
lady to be a witnefs to itherfelf ; wherefore fhe 
thought it would be the beft way, if I pleafed, 
for me to return to him, and enter into fome 
fuch difl'uafive difcourfe as I had before ufed, 
his anfwers to which would confirm what I had 
faid, and be a teftimony againfl him, that he 
could not attempt to deny or evade. To this I , 
replied with an offended air, that I was not ac- 
cuftomed to have what 1 faid doubted; howe- 
ver, on fuch an occalion as this I fhould wave 
■J.l punctilio, to give fatisfa6lion to one for 
whom 1 had fo high a refpe6i: as her ladyfhip ; 
and therefore was ready to do that, or any thing

" Flattered by this compliment, fhe nodded' 
rnajeflicajly, and fupprefiing her wrath as welf 
'.IS fhe could, let me know that fhe would at- 
tend me to the difgraceful fcene. 
"My gallant was by this time beginning to 
be impatient. On my opening the door (which 
I left open for his wife, though I fliot the lock 
to impofe upon him) he advanced to me, and 
taking me by the hand afiied why 1 had not 
brought a light? " Deeds of darknefs (faid ly

" While fhe poured out thefe threats, fhe- 
was fearching for him all round the room; but 
he fortunately efcaped her by creeping under 
the bed, the moment he heard her voice, vi^here- 
he lay in a fituation that may eafilybe conceived. 
Not being able to find him, fhe roared out for 
lights ; but I thought it would be too fevere to- 
give him up, till her anger fhouW be fomewhat 
cooled, and therefore countermanded them ; 
and as fhe had by this time raved herfelf out of

her to. a chair, "Pray, madam, (faid I, in a

" Matters being thus happily adjufted, I cal-

fpread over his cloaths, which were all tum- 
bled and dropping wet from fomething he had 
fpilled in his creeping under the bed, fixed his 
haggard eyes upon his tender mate, v/ho no» 
fooner perceived the fplendid relicks of her 
klnfman's rank abufed in fuch a manner, than 
forgetting her pacific refolution, fhe relapfed in- 
?o all her former fuiy. 
"Audacious villain (exclaimed fhe, her eyes 
glaring with rage, and her whole face diflorted 
with ev^ry diabolical paffion) '"' to profane that

" Saying this, (he fiev/ at the trembling

and, driving her fangs into his cheeks, in an in- 
iiant bathed his face in blood. Cov/ards when

T H E R E V E R I E. I65 
arouzed are always moft defperate. Though 
nothing could have made him face her fury de- 
liberately, the moment he felt her claws in his 
fiefli he forgot his fears, and giving an hideous 
roar, returned her aflault with equal violence, 
faftening one hand in her hair, and firiking her 
on the face and brcali with all his might with the 
other. 
" Tie combat now was really terrible, and 
the viiilory for fome time doubtful. But at 
length with our afliftance, who, when we 
thought {he had fuffcred enough, under the ap- 
pearance of parting them, overpowered him, 
the amazon got the belter, and kneeling on his 
bread as he lay on the ground, vented her rage 
upon him while Ihe vv^is able to ftrike a blow. 
When (lie could beat him no more, we made 
a £hift to feparate and raife them from the 
ground, and having with fome difficulty reftor- 
ed them both to their fenfes, refumed our me- 
diation, in which we were fo fuccefsful, both 
parties being fufficiently fick of the quarrel, 
that a reconciliation was agreed to, which we 
took care fhould be on the moft mortifying 
terms to the old letcher. 
" During all thefe tranfadtions, my poor 
gallant ufed frequently to look at me fo fignifi- 
cantly, that I was afraid his wife would have 
obfervcd it, and extorted an explanation. But 
it efcaped her notice, and he thought proper 
not to mention any thing of the matW ; whe-

vagance would only provoke her more 3 for,

deny the charge, which in that cafe would onlyr 
aggravate his fhame, as he had no proof of it. 
" To confirm him in this opinion, which I 
guefied to be the caufe of his filence when his 
lady and he w^ere iirft ready to dep rt, I mu- 
llered up all the afTurance I could ; and addref-

*' fult offered to me." 
'' To this fpeech fhe replied in the affirma- 
tive, while her hufl:)and returned only one of his 
expreffive looks, and then they lovingly de- 
parted together. 
" When my confederate and I had indulged 
our mirth for fome time, we went to my gal- 
lant's daughter, who, with her lover, was juft 
then come. On my entering the room where 
they were, the ftrongeil anxiety appeared in 
both their faces, though modefty prevented their 
giving it utterance. Not to keep them in pain, 
" You told meyefterday, madam, (faid I, tak- 
'' ing her by the hand) that a thoufand crowns 
" would give you a profpe6l of happinefs, wath

eive you, and hope heaven will blefs it in your 
" hands." 
" What this happy pair felt on this occafion, 
may be eafier conceived than defcribed. They 
tell together on their knees before I could po/Ii- 
bly prevent them, and kifling my hands, bathed 
them with tears of cxtafy . My heart melted in 
fympathy with tliem. I raifed them from the 
ground, and embracing them both, led them» 
unable to fpeak, into the next room, where I 
put the money into the lady's hands, who di- 
revPily gave it to him. We then fat down to 
fupper, during which, to relieve their fpirits 
that were fmking under the prcffure of joy and 
gratitude, I gave a loofe to the pleafure my 
heart wa.s overflowing with, and entertained 
them in the moft obliging and familiar manner ; 
and when the fcrvants retired gratified their cu- 
riofity, which I faw raifed to a toiture, with an 
account of the whole affair, but in the light 
moft favourable to my old gallant, to avoid giv- 
ing his daughter pain, who, notwithftanding his 
unnatural treatment of her, never mentioned 
him but in terms of duty and refpedl. 
" lliough the burgher and his lady had 
promifed, as really they ought for their own 
fakes, to keep this curious affair fecret, it foon 
took wind. The lady, whofe natural fweetnefs 
of temper was not much encreafed by this af- 
fair, never faw the livid marks of her hufband*s 
prov/efs upon her face, or thought of the pro- 
fanation of her kinfman's cloaths, that (he did 
not read him a comfortable ledlure on his bafe- 
nefs and debauchery before all companies ; by 
which means all fhe knew of the matter be-

hint had boaftcd among his intimates of his fup - 
planting the count in my favour ; and when he 
was fo far recovered from the efFe6ts of his 
wife's refentment as to be able to Ihew his face^ 
fcrupled not to fay that he had carried his fuc- 
cefs to th-e height of his wifhes, though he ne- 
ver took courage to renew his applications ta 
me, nor even, which I wondered at, to demand 
reftkutien of his money. 
" This laid me under a neceHity of telling 
the whole affair, in my own vindication, both 
his giving me the money and the ufe I had made 
of it, which gave the ftory another turn , thofe 
who v/ere moil unfavourable in their opinions 
of me before now changing their note, and ex- 
tolling myjuftice and generofity to the fides. 
Nor was this the only advantage I received 
from it. The reft of my admirers, terrified by 
the burgher's fate, thought proper to drav/ olF 
in time, and give up a purfuit that might be at- 
tended with danger ; fo that I was delivered 
from the perfecution of their impertinence. 
" By this time the campaign was ended, and 
my friend returned to me, who ejijoyed the 
whole ftory with the higheft pleafure; but as 
my gallant might fome-way have it in his power 
to make my abode in that place difagreeable, 
for he was more vexed at the ufe I had applied 
liis money to, than at his own lofmg it, before 
he took the field next feafon, he removed me 
hither where I have lived ever fmce, if 
not in the credit I could wifh, yet without any 
new reproach, and where I want nothing fo 
much as the approbation of my own mind to 
make me happy.

fcek this happinefs, by breaking' off my prefent 
conne61:ion with my friend, and returning to 
my family ! But, alas, the things which we 
ought to do are not always in our power. I 
fee what is befl:, but I follow that which is 
worft. My heart is now fo wedded to him, 
( if I may ufe the expi effion ) that death only 
can part me from him ; and though the plea- 
iure I enjoy in his company is never without 
allay, even for the poor pittance of his time 
which it is in his power to fpend with me, from 
the reflexion of its being criminal both in the 
commencement and continuation of it, I have 
not refoluticn, I cannot even fay I have a wifh 
to be feparated from him. 
'^ Befide, whom fhould I return to ? What 
happinefs could 1 expect at home ? My family 
indeed have let me know that they would re- 
ceive me; but how? Not to their efteem ! 
Hiat is impoilible. As a reprobate whom they 
have admitted out of charity, to give her an op- 
portunity of repentance, and fave her from ruin 
in another life as well as this ; as a reproach to 
them, which they would keep among them- 
felves to hide it from the world. Every look 
would upbraid me, every word infult my folly. 
At leaft confcioufnefs would take it in that 
fenfe, which were equally intolerable. 
" I have thus, my dear friend, given you a 
view of my unhappy life, both to entertain you 
and eafe my own heart, by pouring out its griefs 
into your bofom. If you tJiink me worthy of 
the like confidence, or that my advice can be 
of any advantage to vou, I fhail give it with as

endo\ved with the fainteft glimmering of rea^ 
{on. But the caufe of it may eafily be traced. 
Public fame had flattered me into an opinion of 
my own beauty, and many examples juftiiied 
my ambition of rifmg to the moft exalted for- 
tune on the merit of that alone. Yielding there- 
fore to the impulfe of vanity, I thought of no- 
thing but improving that advantage ; and, un- 
der the appearance of ftudying my own plea- 
fure, laid fnares, with the molt anxious and mer- 
cenary ailiduity, for every man whom I thought 
proper for my purpofe : the wretched toil to 
vvliich the greatelt part of our fex devote the 
prime of life. 
" I proceeded for fome time on this plan, 
when the gentleman with whom I am at pre- 
fent conne6led took it into his head to fmgle 
me out for the object of his gallantry. Though" 
hi^ being a married man cut off all hopes of 
fuccefs in my favourite fcheme, there was fome- 
thing fo fiattering to my vanity in being ad- 
mired by a perfon of his rank, that I could not 
rcfift the pleafure of it, efpecially as I meant 
nothing criminal, and this kind of gallantry 
had the fandion of fafliion. 
" As the general intercourfe kept up among 
people ofdiiHnction had been improved into 
fome degree of intimacy between this gentle- 
man's v/ife and me, the afliduity with which he 
paid attention to me upon all occafions for 
fome time pafTed for the effect of familiarity aiid 
friendfhip. But whether fhe fufpe6ted the 
truth, and therefore thought proper to fhew a 
coolncfs to nie, or that confcioufnefs of de- 
ferving it made me think fo, I at length began 
to fancy that Ihc flighted me j and being con- 
firmed 
72 THE REVERIE. 
firmed in that opinion, by finding myfelf omit- 
ted in a general invitation of her acquaintan- 
ces, I conceived the moft violent refentment 
againft her ; to wreak which in the fevereft 
manner 1 affeiSled to liften to her hufband's ad- 
drefles with pleafure, and gave reafon for fuf- 
picions which were foreign to my heart, though 
at the fame time I was not infenfible that by 
fuch a conduct I ran the hazard of defeating 
my original defign ; but this I vainly thought 
I could remedy when I pleafed, by breaking off 
all conne61:ion with him as foon as I had gra- 
tified my pique againft her, 
" There is nothing more dangerous than 
liftening to the allurements of vice, though with 
the moft innocent intention. It is like playing 
on the brink of a precepice. By making the 
idea familiar, it takes off its terrors, and brings 
on a falfe fecurity that generally betrays into a 
fall.

'^ A gentleman of diflinguifhed rank and for- 
tune, but who was far advanced in years, and 
in every refpec^ an objc6i: of averfion and con- 
tempt, unhappily took a liking to me. The 
advantages of fuch a match dazzled the eyes of 
all my friends, who exerted their uimoll influ- 
ence to induce me toconfent to it. Buttho'it 
was the very obje61: I had all along had in view, 
and exceeded the mofl fanguine hope my vani- 
ty had ever formed, when it came to the teft, 
my heart rebelled, and I could not bring my- 
felf to barter happinefs for grandeur. 
" Though I gave this anfvver in the moft 
determined manner, and fupported it with rea- 
fons impoHible to be refuted, my lover would 
not defift. On the contrary, he feemed deter- 
mined to weary me out by his im.portunity, and, 
to fecond it, engaged the authority of my famii- 
ly, on the ftrength of which he alv/ays uro^ed 
his odious fuit with the moft infulting confi- 
dence. 
"■ T'he contraft between this condu61:, and 
the refpe<5lful infinuating addrefs of my former 
admirer was too ftriking. I began to hearken 
to him with more pleafure than ever ; and, from 
a confirmed perfuafion that I could not be hap- 
py with the other, raflily concluded that I muft 
be fo with him, as if the alternative was una- 
voidable.

lecure, and therefore made no fecret of the af- 
fair. The moment it came to my lover's ears, 
lie expoftulated with me upon it in the moft 
paflionate and tender terms ; and though I had 
yet formed no refolutions which made it necef- 
iary for me to account for my condu6l to him, 
I held the other in fuch averfion, that in the 
"weaknefs of my heart I could not conceal it ; 
nor my unhappinefs and apprehenfions from the 
authority and importunities of my friends. 
" He was too well verfed in the fcience of 
intrigue not to take immediate advantage of 
this. He condoled with me on the cruelty of 
fuch a perfecution, enumerated the many in- 
dftances in Vvhich it had been unhappily fuccefs- 
ful ; and heightened my diflike of the other into 
abhorrence, by feveral anecdotes of his charafter 
which I was before a flranger to. Nor did he 
flop here. As he was intimate with his rival, 
he inftantiy exerted all his art to urge him to. 
prefs his fuit with me more earneflly, imputing 
my refufal to coynefs which wanted only to be 
woed, and turning his bafhfulnefs, as he cal- 
led it, into ridicule. 
" While he ftimulated him in this manner, 
he made me believe that he ufed every argu- 
ment which generofity and honour could fug- 
geil, to diffuade him from a purfuit that he 
faw was fo difagreeable, but all in vain; the 
other declaring, that, if I perfifled much longer, 
he v/ould have recourfe to the authority of m.y 
friends, which they had promifed to exert at a 
proper time, when refiftance fhould be out of 
my power. This fcheme was too fuccefsful. 
Urged en by him, my fuitor prefled his addref- 
fcs with redoubled warmth, and enforced them

^vith new offers, which engaged my friends ftill 
mjre languinely in his behalf; and by that 
means confirmed all my lover had faid to me, 
who aggravated my apprehenfions of compiil- 
fion to iuch a height, fixing the very hour when 
I was to be facrificed to a particular day on 
which I had been obliged to accept of an invi- 
tation to his country-feat, in company with 
fome of my neareft relations, that in the mad- 
nefs of affright 1 liftened to the propofals he 
made me, and confented to come away with 
him, perfuaded that, however blameablc fuch a 
ilep might be in other cafes, felf-prefervation 
juftified it in me; fo that I really ran away 
from my fuitor, rather than with my lover. 
" The mvftery of this management I v/as 
not long unacquainted with. He was fo proud 
of the addrefs he had fhewn in it, that the mo- 
ment he had me in his power, he could not 
avoid boaftlng of it in the vanity of his heart. 
This was the hrft thing that awoke me to re- 
flecftion, though I have fmce had abundant rea- 
fons befide. 'I'he mortification of finding my- 
felf duped in fuch a manner, by one whofe un- 
derftanding I had ever held in too low efteem, 
to have any apprehenfions of the kind, with 
the ridiculoudy vexatious circumffances whichr 
attended my elopement, had fuch an effect up- 
on me, that I wrote to my friends in the an- 
guifh of my foul, to beg I might be permitted 
to return, and throw myfelf abfolutely upon 
their mercy in every refpedt but that of beino- 
facrificcd to that odious old creature; but a 
falle pride prevented their complying with my 
requeft. They concluded, though moft in-

who appear mofl: culpable. What will be the 
confequence I dare not even divine. This I 
am determined on : I v/ill not be the fport of 
his caprice, carried about like an unneceffary

The futtler, having taken the circuit he in- 
tended, arrived at the camp to which he was 
going vi^ithoiit any accident, and delivered hi& 
packet into the general's ov.'n hand, who run- 
ning his eye over the contents, '' This will do I 
*' (faid he) This will do! I have long waited 
*' for an opportunity to give them a decifive 
*' ftroke, and now I have got it ; thanks to m v 
*' faithful and vigilant agents ! Sure no other 
*' people ever v/ere fo infatuated as to harbour 
'* the fubje6ls of their enemies thus in their very 
*'.b fom, in a tim.e of open \v w ! They do not 
*^ preconcert a motion that I have not notice 
" of. Indeed if it were not for the intelligence 
** which I receive in this manner, I fhould of- 
^^ ten be at a lofs." 
The purport of the intelligence v/hich ha 
had received was, that the advcrfe army would 
be fo confiderably weakened, as the next day, 
by feveral detachments, that a general attack 
might be made almoft Vvith a certainty of fuc- 
cefs. Such an oppoitunity was not to be mif- 
jTed. He inflantly fet about making all the nt- 
cellary preparations, and fent orders to ari- 
other general, who commanded a feparate bodv 
of forces, but fubordinate to him., to fecond h's 
dcfign, by a vigorous attack at the fam.e time 
on the fide next him. The difpofitions he made 
wore the mod promifing afpedt 5 but, according 
to the ufual uncertainty of military operations, 
his whole fcherne mifcarricd. He met with fa 
warm a reception from the enemy, Vn ho had an 
opportunity of oppofmg their v/holc force to 
him, the other general not attacking af the 
fame time, that he was forced to retreat with 
precipitation and confiderable lofs, and leave

the other, who was juft then coming up, tx- 
pofed to the vi61orious army, which might have 
given him a total defeat, had not that been con- 
trary to the general's fcheme of protrading the 
war; who therefore, content with repuliing 
one part of the enemy's forces, permitted the 
other to retreat without a ftroke. 
This difappointment inflamed the difcord 
which already fubfifted between the two gene-- 
rals ; the chief alledging, that he ihould ha?e 
fuccceded in his attempt, had his orders been 
properly obeyed by the other, v/ho retorted the 
2,ccufation, and faid he was abandoned on pur- 
pofe that he might be cut ofF, which muft have 
been the confequence had not the enemy mif* 
taken a retreat, for which he faw no neceility, 
for a ftratagemto draw him in betv/een the two 
corps, each of which v/as aimoR- equal to hiS 
whole army. ■ 
The confequence of this difa2;reement is ob- 
vious. Each general had his own creatures 
among the cfficers, who, openly efpoufmg the 
caufe of their patrons, began a kind of civil 
v/ar among thcmfelves, which threatened the 
moil: dangerous efFe61:s, bad the enemy been in- 
tent upon taking the advantage of them. 
On my proceeding to take a view of this ar- 
my, I was fenfibly ftruck at the diiFerence be- 
tween it and that which I had [Qen before. In 
the other, though a variety of interefts pre- 
vented the various corps of which it was com- 
pofed from holding that friendly intercourfe 
with each other, that ought to fubfiil be- 
tween men engaged in the fame caufe, yet 
ftill that jealoufy went no farther than an un- 
fociable diflance, and never interfered with 
duty.

tlut5^ The men befide were wcli proviJeci 
with the necellary appointments of evei-y kind,- 
which preferved them in that health and vioor' 
indifpenfably elTential to fuccefs. 
But here every thing v/ore a different afpec^^. 
Though all the fubjeils of the fame fovcreign, 
and therefore united in every view of intereft, 
the officers, as I have obferved, were divided 
into fadlions, and embroiled in conflant quar- 
rels ; and the private men fickly, half-flarved, 
and half-naked ; yet, under all thefe difrrac- 
tions and diftreiles, the levity of temper which 
characlerifes their nation difplayed itfelf in its 
greateR force ; the officers forgetting their ani- 
mofity the moment they had put up their fv/ords, 
and chatting together on mutters of mirth and 
anuifement with all the familiarity of friends, 
till fom.e accident revived their difputes ; and the 
men dancing to divert hunger, and keep them 
warm, and ail venting their ref^fntment againft: 
the authors of their feveral grievances in a fcur- 
iilous fong or lampoon. 
^ While I was making thefe obfervations the 
night after this mifcarriage, my attention was 
ftruck by a converfation. which palled between 
tv/o officers on guard, who, having drawn oft' 
to fome diflance from their men,tho'ughLthem- 
feives in no danger of being over-heard, and 
therefore opened "their hearts'^without referve. 
" I think, (faid one of them, n\mofe accent 
fiiewed him to be a foreigner) that confider- 
ing all things, we got very well over this 
aifair. Had the enemy purfued his advan- 
tage, I do not know what might have been 
the confequence."

*' thing that has drav/n this war out to fuch a 
^' tedious length.. The general v/ho began it

" We had proceeded in this honourable path 
for many ages, when holy Lewis, glowing v>^ith 
pious zeal, undertook to deliver the facred re- 
pofitories of the blefled faints, the places hal- 
lowed by the footfteps of our Lord, from the 
profanation of infidels. Fired at the news of 
iuch a glorious defign, the heir of our illuftri- 
ous houfe led forth the chofen youths of all our 
hills, to fight the battles of the faith. The 
name of their chief prepared a welcome for 
them, and juflified the choice which Lewis made 
of youthful Archibald, to lead the van in all his 
armies, after he had diib'd him his own knight, 
" The unhappy event of this great defign is 
too well known. I fhall therefore confine my- 
felf to what immediately concerns this my moft 
honoured progenitor. During the ftruggles 
which Lewis made with the malevolence of 
fortune, the actions of fir Archibald made him 
the terror of the hofts of the infidels ; at the 
fame time that his exemplary virtues were a 
reproach to the loofer manners of his fellow- 
foldiers. In an excurfion which he made one 
day, in quefi: of intelligence, fate dire6ted his 
fieps to the banks of a rivulet in the neigh- 
bourhood of the Saracen camp, the beauty of 
which tempted him to trace its courfe along the- 
woody vale. 
" He had not proceeded far, when the found 
of female voices ftruck his ear. The fongs with 
which they filled the winding valley, declared the 
innocence and happinefs of their hearts. He lif-

tened for a while ; and then, as he was a truly 
chafte and courteous knight, was turning about 
to retire, for fear of intruding on their privacy, 
when a fhriek of affright told him his alTiflance 
was neceflary to them. He hefitatcd not a mo- 
ment; but, rufning forward, faw that a troop of 
the marauders who fwarmed around the camp of 
Lewis, and difhonoured the chriilian name with 
their atrocious crimes, had furprifcd a band of 
helplefs females, and having difperfed their 
feeble guard of eunuchs, were carrying them 
forcibly away. He knew their danger in the 
hands of fuch worfe than brutal ruffians ; and 
proclaiming his own name in a voice that 
ihook the hills, ran forward to their reicue. 
" Awed at the well-known name, they 
feemed to paufe ; but their leader feeing that fir 
Archibald was alone and on foot, for when he 
firi\ heard the voices he had left his horfc v/ith 
his men, that he m.ight not difturb them as he 
advanced to liften more diftin6lly, waved his 
hand to his aObciates to follow, and clapping 
fpurs to his horfe's fides was out of fight in a 
monient. But all did not efcape fo ealily; the 
well-aimed javelin of fir Archibald pierced the 
hindermoft as he had turned himfelf for flight, 
and brought him life-lefs to the ground. The 
a6live knight inftantly feized the flced of the 
fallen caitif, and vaulting nimbly on him rode 
after the ravifliers, whom he foon over-took, 
the ftruggles of the females impeding their 
flight, and their cries direcSling his purfuit. 
The villains at firft taking him for their com- 
panion avoided him not, nor flood on their de- 
fence ; but the deaths of the two firft of their

fwora, convinced them of their error, and that 
it was impoiTible for them to fly from him. 
" Cuflom had inured them to danger, and 
defpair now made them valiant. Their number 
alfo againft his jQngle arm gave them a profpe6t 
of fuccefs. They let go the women therefore, 
and forming themfelves into a troop bore all 
together upon him. But he difdained to wait 
for their affault ; and rufhlng furioufly into the 
midft of them, for fome time maintained the 
unequal combat, and ballanced their numbers 
by his valour. Five of their bodies now lay 
breathlefs round him, when his horfe, pierced 
to the heart v/ith a fpear, fell to the ground fo 
fuddenly, that all his agility and ftrength were 
not fuiEcient to difengage him from him. In 
this fituation he expe6ted nothing lek than in- 
Itant death, when all at once the afl'ailants 
turned their backs, and fought their fafety in 
£ight. 
" Surprifed at this, fir Archibald looked 
round, and faw his faithful men galloping up 
toward him. They had heard his voice when 
he firft called to the ruffians, and imagining 
that he wanted their alTiftance advanced with 
fpeed by the fide of the rivulet, till they found 
the wretch whom he had pierced with his jave- 
lin ; alarmed at the fight of whom they doubled 
their hafte, and happily came up time enough 
to fave their lord. 
" The firft care of fir Archibald was to 
fearch for the women, whom it was difficult to 
find, their fright having made them hide them- 
felves the moment they had been let go by 
the ruffians. At length, however, the dili- 
gence of his men difcovered them all but one,.

pafiionate terms. Sir Archibiild concluding 
that ihe muft have been carried oft' by fome of 
the ravifticrs, while the reft ftopped to attack 
liim, was at a lofs v/hat to do. It was in vain 
to think of overtaking them without fome guide 
to direct his purfuit, and whom to get he knew 
not. 
' In this perplexity he bethought himfelf of 
trying whether fome intelligence might not be 
gained among thofe who had fallen by his 
fword, if they all were not as yet quite dead. 
He was not difappointed. From one of them 
he learned their place of rendezvous ; and that 
their leader had borne away his prey, as fir 
Arcibald had conjeiStured. The generous knight 
was alarmed at her danger, and, ordering twa 
of his men to condu£l the difconfolate damfcls 
back to the Saracen camp, fet off" himfelf with 
the reft in fearch of her. 
" Vhc place to which he was directed was a 
cave in the darkeft recefs of a wood, at a con- 
fiderable diftance from him. The day was now 
far fpent, and th? way fo difticult to be found, 
" that it was night before they reached the ca- 
vern. Sir Archibald waited not to demand en- 
trance, but drawing his fword ruflied boldly in. 
Heaven feem.ed to have delayed him to the mo- 
ment that fliould make his coming moft criti- 
cal. Inflamed with brutal pailion, the mifcre- 
ant, when he could not pcrfuade the damfel to 
compliance, had refolved to gratify his bafe de- 
fires by force. Her cries reached the ear of fir 
Archibald as he entered the cave, and direfteJ

one ftroke he fevered the wretch's head from 
his body ; when, raifmg the aftonifhed maiden 
from the ground, he ftrove to reftore her fpi-

" At iirfl: fhe threw her eyes wildly round 
the dreary cave, and, filled with the horror of

At length recovering power to fpeak, " What

" Sir Archibald ftood for fome time, unable 
to ftir ; his eyes follov/ed her as far as he could

" Thus did he confume the remaining part of

X5 poifoned, it flackened not his attention 
to the duties of war. On the contrary, the 
troubles of his mind making him weary of life, 
he eagerly fought every occafion of lofmg it 
with honour. In the laft unfortunate acSfion 
between Lewis and the Saracens, Sir Archi-

infidels with fuch impetuofity, that he broke in-

liis appearance that fpoke his noble birth, and 
prejudiced every heart in his favour. His flature 
vvas above the common fize of men, his limbs 
turned in the exa61:eft fymmetry of ftrength and 
beauty. His auborn locks flowed in ringlets to 
the middle of his back, and his dark-blue eyes, 
iparkled vv'ith fenfibiHty and manly fpirit^ while 
a gloom of melancholy, fuited to his prefent fta^

over the ruddy bloom which youth had painted 
oh his cheeks. 
" He had not ftood long, with his eyes fixed 
on the ground, and his heart throbbing with

'' The ftate of fir Archibald's heart, when

" He continued thefe melancholy relie«51:ions 
while the princefs was examining fomc of the

when the eunuch beckoned to him to advance 
to the tent. His emotions now were flronger 
than he could bear. He fcarce had power to

" As the time for executing their flagitious 
defign was juft arrived, Achmet went to take 
his evening's repafl, and feating himfelf on the

called for fome cooling beverage, to flack his 
thirfl:. The cup-bearer, who had every thing 
prepared, prcfentcd him the bowl, when fir 
Archibald, who watched his looks, and plainly 
perceived the anxiety of guilt in his face, made 
a lignal agreed upon to Achmet, and then v/ent 
into the inner tent, v, here he found the other 
loading himfelf with the gold and jewels of his

indifputable evidence of his guilt upon him, as

he feized the cup-bearer alfo, who flood pant-

" The accomplices no fconer faw each other 
apprehended in tliis manner, than they funk 
into the defpondency of confcious guilt, and 
waited, pale and trembling, for the fate v/hich 
hung over them. ''Mifcreants, (faid Achmet,

To thy honour I am bold to truft myfelf, nor

AS the late mifcarriage had made a confi- 
derable alteration in the fituation of af- 
fairs, it was ncccfTary to fend notice of it to all 
the parties engaged in the fame caufc, that they 
might regulate their mcafures accordingly. No- 
thing could draw a Uronger pi(5iure of human 
vanity, than the terms in which this account 
was given. Inflcad of owning with candour 
that they had been feverely repulfed, and in 
danger of an abfolute defeat, they only faid, 
" that the enemy having efcaped by accident 
" from an attack by which they deflgned to 
'' have gained a decifive victory, they had 
" thought proper to make feme alterations in 
*' the plan of their operations for the rcll of the 
*' campaign.*' 
But this vain cvafion was inftantly {^zxt 
through ; the Heps they were obliged to take,

As there was nothing more to be (een here, 
I took the opportunity of accompanying a cou-

of the arm.ies, confederate in the fame caufe, 
the general of which had acquired fuch repu-

ders to double all the fortifications of his camp, 
and then returned a fummary anf/zer to the mi- 
nider, that the fituation of affairs at that time 
made it impoflible for him to obey his direc- 
tions. 
Snih cautious condu^l: in an army, whofe 
ftrength fcenied ahnod to make all caution un- 
neceliiirv, appeared very extraordinary ; Sut a 
little obfervation explained the reafon of it. liv 
the mean time other occurrences, new to mc, 
and ftrange in fpcculation, though common i:i 
the military pradice, attracted my attention. 
As the 'general v/ent to take a view of his 
entftnchmehts,, that he might fee vvherc it was 
m3.fi: proper ta add to their flrength, according 
to his own fyflem, he was met b}'- a deputa- 
tion from the inhabitants of the country, on a 
moft interefling occafion. Though he v/as de- 
termined not to take the leafl notice of any 
thing they could fay, he thought proper to give 
them an hearing, to fave appearances. 
Theperfon who fpoke to him, in the name of 
the reft, addrefling him v/ith an air of refpecft, 
mixed with indignation, " I am fent to your

*' fuftain. Reprefent our cafe in its proper co- 
*' lours to your fovereign; and, in the mean 
*' time, fufpend the execution of orders which 
** overwhelm us with defpair.'' 
The general heard this pathetic_ fpeech with- 
out the leaft emotion; and as foon as it was 
. concluded, " I am forry for your HifFerings ; 
*' (anfwered he coldly) but the redrefs of them 
*' lies not in my power. You muft apply to 
" the miniftry. If they fupply me with other 
*' means to fupport the war, I Ihail be glad ; 
*' till then I muft make ufe of thofe in my 
" hands." Then turning diredlly to an of- 
ficer who ftood near him, he ordered the con- 
tributlon>s

tiibutions to be levied, without favour or de- 
lay. 
The unfuccefsful advocates had fcarce de- 
parted when an exprefs arrived from one of his 
advanced polls, to inform him that the enemy 
had laid all that fide of the country in flames, 
and were juft then making fome motions which 
^appeared as if they intended to attack him in 
his entrenchments. His officers heard this 
account with the higheit indignation ; and, 
confiding in their numbers, expreiVed their ea- 
gernefs to prevent fuch an infult, by march- 
ing out directly to meet them. 
But the general difregarded their ardour, and 
firmly refolved to puifue his own fyftem ; 
* The enemy fhould know me too well, (faid 
* he) to imagine that I can be taken with 
* fuch a bait ! When there is nothing more 
* to burn, the flames will go out of them- 
* felves. All their braving fhall not make mc 
' quit the advantage of my fituation. The

* a very different ftate. A yi^lory might ac- 
* complifii all their dcfigns, which are difap-r 
' pointed as effeftually by delay as by a defeat; 
* it is therefore right in them to rifk every 
* thing. But the contrary is our cafe; we 
' might lofe every thing by a defeat ; and do 
* gain as much by delay, as we could by vic- 
* tory ; fo that to pat any thing to the hazard 
* were madnefs. As to the difgrace to our 
* honour, in being braved thus, that is nothing. 
' Succefs alone is honour in war.. I am for-

v'aymg this, he continued his ride, alfolutely 
anirovcd at the fight of the flatiies v/hich aroie

Having confirmed myfelf in Tny refolutlon by

with any other perfon, as I had done before j 
hut availing myfeJf of the powers with v/hich 
the fpirit had endowed me, I wifijcd myfelf 
directly into the enemy's camp. 
The firft things that ilruck me here were 
the eagernefs and afHduity of every individual, 
fo different from the liiHefs fl-upidity and care- 
lefsnefs Vv'hich had given me fuch difgufl in the 
other armies. The foidiers fecmed by their 
I^oks to underfland the motives of the war in 
which they were engaged, and to think thcm- 
felves intereffed in the event. Such a ri;;ht 
gave me plcafure. " This (thought I) is fome-

As I was making thefe refletStions, the com- 
mander (whom I found to be therr fovereign) 
pafled me, and by his affability and encourage- 
ing addrefs added wings to the diligence with 
which they all ftrove to execute his commands. 
I joined him dire6lly, ftudious to obferve eve- 
ry look and ad^ion of fo extraordinary a per- 
fon. 
He was that morning making a general re-- 
view of his army, which was drawn out for 
that purpofe. Though every thing was ftricl- 
ly regular, and bore the molt martial appear- 
ance, I remarked that the monarch frequently 
iighed as he- darted his experienced eye along 
the ranks. He fcemed to Took for fomething 
which he could not find, and melted almoil 
into tears at the tender youth of the greater part 
. of his troops. 
But if the private men appeared young and 
unexperienced, the officers of every degree 
wore the oppofite chara(5lers in their counte- 
nances. Birth, riches, or favour, evidently 
had no place in their promotion. They rofe 
by merit alone, and the foldier who deferved 
command was fure of obtaining it. This v/as 
the moft effecftual provifion v/hich human pru- 
dence could make to enfure fuccefe ; nor did 
the event difapp'int it. If the inferiority of 
his numbers hindered his obtaining decifive 
victories, the excellent difcipline of his forces 
fo far ballanced that advantage, that his enemies 
could not prc^-arl againft him. 
When 
THE REVERIE. 131 
When he had finifhed the bufmefs of the 
morning, he retired to his tent, and throwing 
himfelf,^with a fatigued look and difcontentpd 
air, into a chair, '* When will this horrid 
" work be at an end ? ( faid he ) When fhall 
" my wearied heart have reft ? O ambition,

*' fuch is the glory of this world, however 
" hiirhly blazoned by prejudice and vanity ; the 
^' echo of a found that has pafled by, the {ha- 
'' dow of a cloud that floats in the air." 
He was interrupted in thefe reflections by 
the arrival of a courier, with dilpatches from 
one of his minifters. The moment he ran his 
eve over them, that gloom of laiTitude and dil- 
content which overcaft his brow vanifhed, 
his eye fiaflied with refcntment and martial ar- 
dour^ and his whole frame fecmed to be on 
hre. He gave orders for all his generals to at- 
tend him dlreaiy, and then walking a turn or 
two about his tent, " No! (faid he) it is not 
" come to that yet. Never will I fubmit to

The entrance of his officers broke oiFhis me- 
ditations. He paufed a moment, to moderate 
the emotions of his foul, and then addreUing 
himfeif to them, " My friends, (faid he) our 
*"^ enemies infult us. They make propofals too

lancholy, fierce delight. They all wiflied to-,

country wafte j if that could not be accom-- 
plifliedy death appeared a defirable releafe from-

As for the monarch, the approach of fuch a

his attention from the refledtions which tor- 
tured him before. Unentangled in the tender 
connexions of nature, which, as it were,, mul- 
tiply a man into many feifs for the fafety of 
each dear particular of whom, his anxiety is 
greater than for his own, he looked forward 
to the dreadful hour unmoved ; and, defpifing 
any danger whi. h threatened himfelf,. was not 
dilturbed with fympathctic apprehenfions for 
others. 
At length the moment, loaded with the fate 
of fo many thoufands, arrived. The horrors 
of fuch a fight are beyond defcription ; my 
foul Hill fickens at the thought. I have faid 
that the attack was to be made in the night. 
Nature, as if to hide the madnefs of mankind, 
wrapped the guilty fcene in tenfold darknefs. 
This was favourable to the aflailants. Infpired 
witli the refolution of their fovereign, they 
fcnew that their road to vi61:ory was right for- 
wards, and rufliedon with an impctuofity iiri- 
polTible to be refilled ; while their oppo- 
nents, attacked on every fide, knew not 
where to dire6l their force. But neither did 
they know whither to retreat. If diftraclion 
therefore made their efforts lefs effectual, de- 
,fpair fupported their refolution. They fought 
at random, and deftroyed their friends as well 
as their enemies : but ftill they fought with va- 
lour, heightened by-defpair. At length their 
©ditrenchinents were all.iorcedj and they w^ere 
diiven,^.

driven, themfelves fcarce knew whither. The 
darknefs, which before was againft them, prov- 
ed now their fecurity. Purfuit was impoflible. 
The advantage alfo had already coft the vi6lors 
fo dear, that they were cautious j as the leaft 
mifcarriage might reverfe the fuccefs. 
The heart of man muft be feared againft 
every feeling of humanity, to fupport fuch a 
fight as the morning-light difclofed. The vic- 
torious monarch, animated with all his martial 
enthufiafm, was unable to bear it. He led his 
men, harrafled as they were, in purfuit of 
the cjiemy, though he expe6ted not to over- 
take them ; but then it removed him from this 
horrid fcene. 
As foon as his fpirlts had cooled a little from 
the ardour, or rather madnefs, necelTary to 
fupport them through their late exertion, he 
fought to relieve nature by reft. But the la- 
bours of his mind were far from being at an 
end. Sleep had no foqner overpowered his wea- 
ry fenfes, than his imtigination was at work, 
and placed him in the midft of the tumults and 
confuhon from which he was but juft delivered. 
He gave aloud the feveral words of command, 
and fought over again the whole battle of the 
night before, with as much eagernefs and 
anxiety as if he was a«5tually engaged, till at 
length the hurry of his fpirits and agitation 
. of his whole frame awoke hirh, little refrefbed 
bv fuch broken flumbers. Such a life coitld 
not aftbrd pleafure in the contemplation. I 
was juft turning from him, furfeited with, he- 
roifm and gretitnefs, when an affair that {hewed 
his charadler in a new light attraded my at- 
tention.

ed to his words with a kind of religious vene- 
ration, prepared to obey whatever he fhould 
command, without prefuming to difcufs it even 
in their own minds, as if he had been a being 
of a fuperior nature. 
Having difpatched thefe affairs, he retired 
to meet the happy author, who had received

conllder how he fhould difpofe of his new for-

riety of fchemes, he at laft refolved to fix his 
abode in the territories of a certain free but 
poor ftate, where he Tnould be at liberty to 
purfue his own inclinations without interrup- 
tion, and gain refpeit by the magnificence which 
he was now able to difplay. 
This firft point being fettled, his thoughts 
naturally recurred to the means by which he 
iiad acquired his fortune. Amply as the mo- 
narch had paid him for the honour of fathering 
his works, his vanity took the alarm at the 
fame he fnould lofe, and envy determii.e I him 
to break faith with his benefa61:or, and betray

The deliberate bafenefs of this rcfolution, fo 
contradiftory to the proper ufe of the powers 
which produced the occaiion of it, tempted me 
to look back to the principal occurrences in the 
life of fo extraordinary a perfon. He was born 
in a neighbouring country, where genius is 
encouraged by approbation, and flarves in the 
mid ft of flattery. Abilities, fuch as his, foon 
diftinguifhed themfclves. He became the fa- 
vourite of the publick, and heard nothing but 
his own praifes. But his reign was not long. 
He thought with a freedom and fpirit which 
gave jealoufy to a government eftablifhed on 
the principles of defpotifm, and was obliged to 
fly his native land, to avoid falling a facrifice 
to his fame. 
The country In which he took refuge was 
in every rcfpe6l the rcverfe of that he left. Ap- 
probation v/as given fparingly, and never f jon j

hut the more fubftantial reward of prefent pro- 
£.1 fcldom difappointed merit ; and rational li- 
berty gave genius its full fcope. Here he firfl: 
tailed the fweets of independency, and formetl 
fchemes for eftabl idling himfelf in the pofTef- 
fion of that ineilimable bleiling. But his eager- 
nefs dif:ppointed him, by betraying him into 
iome adaons which obliged him to quit that 
country as precipitately as he had his own, to 
avoid a more ignominious fate. 
After fome time fpent in difcontented ram- 
bling, this prince, whom his fame had reached-, 
iiot only gave him an afylum in his dominions, 
but alfo heaped his favours on him fo laviflily, 
that he refumed his hopes of independency, 
■which this lafc affair enabled him toaccomplifk

and iirlr raifed his hopes, whom he calum- 
niated with the mofl m^alignant virulence, as 
foon as he v/as out of the reach of their of-

Angularity, of fliewing himfelf vvifer than all

truth of, and treat with contempt thefe princi- 
ples which had ever been held in the higheil- 
rerpe6t, and eftabliflied as the rules of moral 
a£lion, the foundations of religious faith. 
Impious and abfurd as fuch vanity was, it 
found applaufe and imitation from the kindred 
vanity of the greater part of mankind ; and the 
intereft they had in fupplanting an authority 
that contradided their pradice, and made it 
criminal in the eyes of others, and dangerous 
in their own. 
To this caufe chiefly he was indebted for 
the rapidity of his rife to fame ; for literary 
merit, however great, is obliged to ftand the 
teft of time before it meets general approb.l- 
tion, where fome lucky circumftance does not 
concur thus to favour it. 
Shocked at fuch a proftitutlon, I left him to 
purfue hisown machinations ; and, having abur- 
dantly fatisfied my curiofity wiih militaVy mat- 
ters, refolved to change the fcene cf my obferva-

gaged in war, in hopes that, for the credit of hu- 
man nature, I miglit find the meafures of their 
civil government deduced from more rational 
principles than thofe which appeared to influ-

in council, in the midft of his minifters. 
Tiiere appeai-ed in his looks a phlegm, which 
in 
THE REVERIE. 149 
in c5ifFerent countries is taken to denote thecnt- 
ferent qualities of vvlfdom and ftupioity ; and 
which here feerned to have extended its fopori- 
fick influence over all prefent, who fat wiih 
their eyes fixed upon the table, as if waiting in 
fufpenhon of thought for fomething to fet their 
faculties at work. 
They had continued in this ftate for (owe 
time, when a female entered and placed her- 
(tiU at the right hand of the fovcreign. Her 
features were ilrong, and mafculine; ilie was 
drefl'ed in the robes of independent royalty, 
and the hnughtine's o( her looks and deport- 
ment (hewed that (lie efteemcd heifelf fuperlor 
to all the princes of the world. 
The moment (he entered, the whole council 
alTumed a r'^w appearance. The fovereign 
looked abaflied, and the miniflers, rouz d from 
their former ferenity, waited for her words 
vv^ith fear and trembling. '' I ordered your 
*' attendance, (laid flie, looking fiercely round, 
*^ the lire of her foul fiadiing from her eyes as 
*' fhe fpokc) to let you know \vbat: I will have 
*' done in the prefent conjun£lure. 1 will no 
*' longer bear to be braved thus by my valiais^ 
*' who by the weaknefs of fome of my prede- 
ceiTors have acquired this unnatural power 
of rebelling againft their favereign. They 
{hall be declared public e~nen"Lies to the gene- 
ral fl:ate,and the refl of the feudatories nblig- 
" ed to join their forces, according to the 01- 
" dinances of thofe who gave ihem the power 
" they nowpo(]cfs,to reduce them to their proper 
" ftate of obedience. When tlvefe have done 
'* that, the troops of my own d' minions fhaU 
*' humble them alfo. I will no longer be op- 
H 3 " *' pofed

'' pofed by fuch ingrateful flaves ; for fuch they 
** were, and fuch they f)"iali be again. And 
" you, lir, (addrelTing lierfelf to the foverelgn) 
*' muft enforce this fentence with your autho- 
*' rity. The rank to which you have been 
*' raifed by your alliance with me, enables 
*' you to do any thing, if you had but proper 
" fpirit. 
" Madam, (anfvvered the fovereign) I — I — 
'' I can do nothing. You have taken all the 
^' power into your own hands, and left nothing 
"^ for me to do." 
" Yes, ( replied fhe, with a look of the 
'' higheft contempt) you can drink away your 
" fenfes; and that is ail you mind. Had I 
" been biefied with an hulband of fpirit equal 
*-'' to my own, we fhouid have fubdued tb^ 
" world. All mankind would have been my 
" fiaves. But now the work is all my own ;. 
" you only contribute an empty name." 
Then turning to her fecretary, " Let this de- 
" cree be notified to all the other valTals with- 
*' out lofs of time, that they may prepare to 
*' obey it." 
" May it pleafe your moft auguft majefty, 
" (faid the fecretary, making an obeifance as 
" low as adoration) is this fentence intended 
" only againft the principal power with u'hom 
" you are at war ? Or are all his friends, thofe 
" 1 mean who have not directly declared againft

" A\], all; (anfwered fhe) their prefump- 
" tion is equal, and fo fhall be their pun ifh- 
^' ment. Thofe who even hefitate to obey my

'' Let it be read ; jffaid (lie, Impatiently) I

While the fecretary was miaking this recital, 
every feature of his mifirefs's face was diiio:ted 
with the different paffions of pride, rage, and 
revenge ; but thefe lafc v/ords hurried her beT- 
yond ail patience. "Villain! (faidfhe, fnatchr-

*« all their oppofition, while I have a fubjecr 
♦' able to draw a fword." 
The vehemence with which (he fpoke thefe 
words awoke her royal confort, who was fo 
affe6led by the rebuke fhe had given him juft 
before, that he fell afleep. Starting therefore, 
"Hah! What! What oppofition ? (faid he, 
" ftaring about, and repeating her laftworJ) 
" What oppofition ? '* 
"Peace, idiot! foti (anfwered his gentle 
" mate) the only oppofition I regard, is that

«' fo highly upon, to be all cancelled from the

Saying this, (he arofe; and, difmiffing the 
council with a motion of her hand, retired, 
her royal confort not venturing to fpeak a

own apartment, where fhe met her confef- 
for, who was waiting for her. " I fent for you, 
*' father, (faid flie) to unburthen my confci- 
*' ence, which cannot bear the weight of any 
*' thing that even looks lilce a crime. The 
*' event of this war not immediately anfwering 
" my expe6lations5 I have confented to a pro- 
'' pofal made to me, of having my enemy taken

*' both thefe orders have been put in execu- 
*' tion this morning, I fent for you to receive 
" abfolution." 
" The piety of your moft facred majefty 
*' ( anfwered the ecclefiaftic ) is highly com- 
^' mendable, and deferves the indulgence of the 
*' holy church in. the molt unlimited degree. 
^'Such; 
THE REVERIE. 155 
'' Such things, to be fure, are in general crimi- 
" nal; but particular circumllances may change 
" their nature. The urgency of your majefly's 
" affairs requires difpatch, and your honour 
" muft be vindicated. 1 hefe confideraiions 
" are in themfelves of weight to authorize what 
'' elfe ought to be avoided. But there is ano- 
*' ther reafon ftill ftronger, and which makes 
" the actions that hurt the tendcrnefs of your 
" confcience meritorious, inftead of reprehen- 
" fible. Your enemy is an heretic, and thcre- 
'' fore out of the prote(il:ion of all law^s humain 
'' and divine ; and thofe who refufed to a/Tifl 
*' you apainft him, though not formally here- 
" tics themfelves as yet, difcover by that re- 
*' fufal a kind of tendency that v/ay, and 
" Ihould be prevented by v/hobfome chaftife- 
" mcnt ; the firft duty of all true fons of the; 
" church being to extirpate herefy." 
Having quieted her majefty's confcience by 
this pious diilim^ion, lie proceeded to the ce- 
remony of giving her abfolution, which he per- 
foimed with a folem.nity and parade equally 
impious and ridiculous on fuch an occafion. 
When this important affair was finifhcd, 
addreifing his penitent with a look of ja>y, '' I 
'' have the happinefs ( faid he) to congratulate 
" your majefty on the higheft honour which 
" can be obtained in this world. Our moft 
.' holy father, in token of his approbation of 
*' your zeal for the glory of the church, has 
" thought proper to grant you an addition to 
*' your titles, which gives you the pre-emi- 
" nence over all the potentates on earth ; and 
^' has blefled me with the office of impofmg it 
'-' in his name, whenever your majeily pleafes 
H (jt ' '' to 
156 T H E R E V E R I E. 
" to appoint a time for the glorious ceremonies 
" which his wilidom has inflituted for that pur- 
" pofe." 
" I have a juft fenfe of his holinefs*s favour, 
" (anfwered fhe) and fhail be glad to receive 
*' it in the proper manner as foon as poffiblc, 
*' as my whole foul is implicitly devoted to 
*' the ceremonies of our divine religion." 
'' To-morrow then (faid he) will 1 perform the 
" facred office of this fecond baptifm, and give 
" you a title that fhall be expreffive of the regard 
*' you fo nobly fhew at this time for the ad- 
'' vaiicement of the faith ; for which purpofe I 
*' will go directly and give orders for adorning 
*' the great church with all the precious and 
^' coflly images, and relics of the faints and 
^^ angels, who will look down with pleafure 
'* to behold your majefty raifed to a degree of 
*' honour fuperior even to their own. You 
*' \rill pleafe to command all the great officers 
*' cti' your court to attend, that nothing may 
*' he v/anting to make the ceremony truly 
' grand." 
While her majefty was preparing for this 
^rrtat aH'air, my curiohty prompted me to fee 
how her royal confort difpofed of his time.. 
As foon as the council was broken up, in 
which- he made the important figure that 
has been related, he haftened to his own par- 
ticular apartments, v/here, throwing off the 
mockery of royalty with which he was encum- 
bered, he fat down v/ith fome of his moft in- 
tmate favourites, to drown the cares of ftate 
in Vw'ine. 
The converfation was fuited to the occa- 
fion. '■ i* or my part (faid tlie fovereign, filling 
'' his rummer) I cannot conceive what plea- 
" fure 
THE REVERIE. 157 
^' fure thofe people find in politics, and wars, 
" and fuch like turbulent perplexing matters. 
" I never think of the former, that they do not 
" make my head ake; though the truth is, her 
'' majefty, for the moft part, faves me that 
"trouble. And then, for fighting! I blefs 
*' my ftars I am no hero; nor, while I have a 
" bottle of fuch wine as this before me, envy 
*' any of them their laurels." 
" It would be happy for the world, (faid 
" one of the company, while the fovereign 
" quaffed off his bumper) if all princes 
" were of your majefty's way of thinking. 
" The pleafures of life might then be enjoyed 
" in peace and fatisfa£lion." This turned 
the diicourfe naturally on thofe pleafures, which, 
they all talked over with the greateft keennefs, 
till it was time to go to the opera, where his 
majefl^y feldom failed to fpend the evening. 
His royal confort, elated at the thought of 
the mighty things which had been done for her 
that morning, and of the facrcd honour fhe 
was to receive next day, went thither alfo, to 
indulge the happinefs of her heart ; but hap- 
pening in the courfe of the entertainment to 
obferve that herhufband looked with more than 
common earneftnefs at one of the female per- 
formers, fhe gave orders to one of her officers 
to remove her that very night out of her do- 
minions, without permitting her hufband to 
fee her, not bearing that any other fhould in- 
terfere with her in the only advantage ihe 
reaped from her marriage. 
The ceremony of the next day exceeded all 
defcrlption. Every inflance of pomp, both fe- 
cular and religious, which fuperflition and va- 
nity 
6 
158 THE REVERIE. 
nity could fuggeft, was difplayed to make the 
farce complete, without any regard to the danger 
of offending the Deity By fuch an hypocritical 
proftitution of rites appropriated to his fervice, 
and many of them appointed by himfelf. 
But the joy of her moft pious majefty was 
foon damped. She had flattered herfelf, that 
the fcheme for poifoning her enemy was laid fo 
well, and committed to fuch trufty hands as to 
be fafe from difappointment or detedlion. On 
this her confeflbr built fo ftrongly that he re- 
jColved to promife fome fignal and fpeedy in- 
ilance of fuccefs, as a divine ratification of her 
new title. Accordingly, in the oration with 
which he concluded the ceremony, he worked 
himfelf up into the appearance of prophetic 
'Cnthufiafm, and ventured even to point out the 
death of her enemy, as if by immediate infpi- 
ration, defcriblng his agonies in a rhetorical 
flourifh, and attributing his fate to the hand of 
Heaven, as a punifhment for his rebellion 
againft his fovereign. 
The effe^l which this had upon the multi- 
tude is not to be exprefTed. Prepared by their 
natural fuperflition to believe every thing their 
prielts pleafed to tell them, they locked for the 
inftant accomplifhment of this prediction with 
fuch ftrong faith, that, had the expected news 
arrived at that time, they would have received 
it implicitly as a miracle ; and moft probably 
have fallen down and worfhipped their fove- 
reign, in whofe favour it would have appeared 
to have been wrought. 
But, unluckily for the poor prophet, juft as 
he had finifhed his declamation, ;^n account was 
received that the attempt upon the king's life 
had 
THE REVERIE. 159 
had mifcarried, and her moft pious majefty's 
privity to it been dete£led In the plaineft man- 
ner, fo as to reflect an indelible difgrace upon 
her in the eyes of the world ; and that her ar- 
my, which was to have ravaged the territories 
of his friends, had been repulfed with great 
lofs, and by a body of fuch inferior force as to 
look like the iinmediate interpofition of Provi- 
dence. The confequence of this may be eafi- 
ly conceived. 7 he preacher was afhumcd to 
Ihew his face : the glorious title was turned in- 
to ridicule ; and her raajefty was overwhelmed 
with vexation at her difappointment. 
As foon as {lie had recovered herfelf a little, 
Ihe fummoned her council again on this im- 
portant occafion. After long deliberation, it 
was at laft concluded to give up a confiderable 
part of the territories of fome of her moft faith- 
ful friends, to one of the powers confederate 
with her in the war, to induce it to exert all 
its fjrce to opprefs an enemy from whom they 
met fuch unexpected refiftance ; for, fo ftrong 
was the hatred of her foul againft him, that 
(he would ruin herfelf rather than he (hould 
efcape ruin. As to the charge of being con- 
cerned in the infamous and horrid fcheme of 
poifoning him, fhe afFeCkd to treat it with 
contempt, as a groundlefs flander, to which 
fhe difdained to make any anfwer. 
But- the fanguine hopes flie built upon this 
abfurd expedient, which brou ht into her 
neighbourhood a rival infinitely more danger- 
ous than the one whom fhe wanted todeftroy, 
were foon overthrown. Her exprefles were 
fcarce difpatched, v. hen fhe received ari ac- 
count of the death of her ally, upon wh'ife 
affiflance 
i6o THE R E V E R I E. 
affiflance fhe depended ; and from whofe fuc- 
ceflbr fhe had juft reafon to apprehend even 
^ worfe than the difappointment of her hopes, as 
j^^ his avowed attachment to her enemy had en- 
gaged her in intrigues againft his life alfo, 
which he had difcovered^ and would now moft 
probably ihew his refentment of, by turning- 
his forces againft her. 
This event difconcerted all her fchemes, 
and fhewed her that the ruin of her enemy, 
which fhe had purfued with fuch inveteracy, 
and flattered herfelf with the thought of being 
fo near, was now removed farther off than 
ever, if not abfolutely out of her power to ac- 
complilh. However, the blind implacability 
of her foul was not to be convinced. She re~ 
folved to double all her efforts; flie ordered 
every fubje^t in her dominions to take arms ; 
and laftly propofed to the profefTed enemies 6f 
her faith, to fhare with her the conqueft which 
they fhould aflift her to make in a war, alledg- 
ed to have been undertaken on a religious mo- 
tive, facrificing every obligation, human and 
divine, to an impotent defire of revenge ; and 
thus concluded a day hallowed in the annals 
of her reign, by the reception of her facred 
title. 
Such fcenes were too fhocking to be dwelt 
on. I refolved to leave that court dire6ily ; 
and took the opportunity of travelling with a 
courier whom her facred majefly f'-nt to one of 
her allies, that I might take a view of that 
part of his dominions in which he refided at 
that time, and learn fomething of the man- 
ners of the people with whom I was yet unac- 
quainted.

More happy efeSfs of greatnefs ; ivlth a new way 
of punijJnng d'lf obedience ^ an(i making the moji 
of powe)\ 
THE courier had fcarce entered the terri- 
tories of the prince to whom he was fent, 
when he wds feized by a band of free-booters, 
who, without any regard to his character, 
dragged him away to their chief. It w^as late 
when he fell into their hands; and as they had 
prowled to a confiderable diftance from home, 
they concluded to flop at their own place of 
habitation till morning. 
Nothing could equal the brutal behaviour 
of thelc favao-es, but their worfe than brutal 
infolence, and the mifery in which they lived. 
They threw their captive into the corner of ^ 
hovel, Tn which the leader of the gang dwelt, 
among their fwine and cows ; the beft place in 
the hut, if any could be called by that title, 
being referved for their horfes, who fared \x\ 
every refpeil better than their mafters ; and 
then, devouring a mefs of food which any hu- 
man creatures, not immediately impelled by fa- 
mine, would have turned from with loathing, 
lay dov/n to fleep upon an heap of ftraw, all 
mixed together, v/ithout any regard to decen- 
cy or diflerence of fcx, v/here they fnoredtili 
next morning ; when theyarofe as foon as it 
was light, and licking up what their dogs had 
left 
i62 THE R E V E R I E. 
left of their over-night's fare, hurried their cap- 
tive av^ay to their lord. 
When they arrived at his caflle they met him 
going to his {tables, and, falling on their knees 
in" the wet and mire with which the whole 
place was plentifully covered, informed him- 
of their fuccefs. The courier, without waiting 
for his lordfhip's making them any reply, ad- 
drefTed him boldly, and, telling what he Vvas, 
complained heavily of the outrage he had fuf- 
fered, and demanded to be fet immediately at 
liberty, to purfue his journey, as he was charged 
with difpatches of theutmoft importance to his 
fovereign. The air of freedom with which he 
fpoke offended the pride of the mighty lord; 
but his dignity was ftruck at by this laft word 
in a manner that he did not think proper to 
bear, for he would not have his vaflals even 
fufpedt that he paid obedience to any power 
upon earth. " Take hence that flave, ( faid 
" he, without deigning to look at him) and 
" throw him into the dungeon. I'll chaftife 
''him for his infolence. My fovereign ! A 
*' nohle7nan owns no fovereign." Then turninor 
to his people, who ftill continued kneeling, 
" What more have you brought me? (faid he) 
" I fent you word that I was going to at- 
'' tend the great convention of the ftates, and 
'' wanted money." 
To this terrible fpeech the principal of the 
gang anfwered, that they had no money them- 
felves, nor were able to get any, though they 
had fcoured the whole country in fearch of it. 
'' Villains I dogs ! (exclaimed his lord, flying 
" at the poor trembling wretch, and beating 
♦' him unmercifully with his horfe-whip) Tell 
me 
(6 
T H E R E V E R I E. 163 
*' me not that you have no money. You mufl 
'' find it for me, or I'll fell yourfelves, your 
" wives and children, for flavcs. Be gone ; 
" and either bring me money to-morrow morn- 
" ing, or every female in your families. I'll 
" make you know that I will be obeyed." 
The wTetches went away without daring to 
expoflulate, while their potent lord flrutted off, 
fwollcn with the thou2;ht of havinp- fo many of 
his fellow-creatures fubjecl to his pleafure. 
As foon as he entered his caftle, he ordered 
the courier to be brouo-ht before him ap-ain, and 
havmg reprmianded him feverely for behaving 
with luch infolence to a pcrfon of his import- 
ance, difmifTed him., now that his own vaflals,. 
into whom he meant to flrike a terror, were 
departed. Every thing about him was in cha- 
radler. His caftle, which his own people 
thought one of the grandeft palaces in the 
world, was a mean, incommodious, but indif- 
ferently ftrong place ; the furniture, foir.e of it 
rich, but old, aukward, and ill-fuited, and 
mofl of the leller conveniences of life utterly 
wanting ; and here was this petty tyrant ferved 
with a parade and oilentation, which were a 
fevere though jufl ridicule upon the pomp and 
vanity of ftate. 
There was fomething fo new to me in this 
fcene, that I refolved to purfue it farther. I 
therefore quitted the courier for the company 
of this noblefjiariy with whom I faw I fhould 
have an opportunity of travelling to the court, 
when he fhould go to the convention of the 
Hates, in equipping his horfes, for which grand 
occafion he fpent the reft of the day y for on 
them was all his pride difplayed.

The next morning produced a fcene that wa*- 
a difgrace to the human name. His wretched 
vafials, in obedience to his dread commands, 
came with all their mothers, fifters, wives, and 
daughters, for he had made no exception of age 
or infirmity, driven before them like a herd of 
cattle to the market. They alfo brought all 
their worldly fubftance, confiding of the 
wretched utenfils of their houfes, their imple- 
ments of hulbandry, and their cattle, to give 
in the place of their women, if their lord would 
be gracioufly pleafed to accept of the exchange, 
and let them ftarve together. 
The cries of the females, and the diflrefs 
painted in the faces of the men, for they did 
not dare to complain, are not to be exprelled ; 
but neither made any impr iKon on their lord, 
whofe noble heart was above the vulgar weak- 
neffes of humanity. "So ! (faid he flernly) then 
*' you have dared to difcbey my commands, and 
*' not brought me the money?" 
^^ Mighty lord! ( anAvcied an ecciefiaflic,:

■« fubftance." 
While the priefl: was making this pathetic 
addrefs, the lord was viewing his property, and 
bargaining for them with fome Jewifh flave- 
merchants, whom he had fummoned on the 
occafion, and who are always ready to purchafe 
fuch unhappy creatures, to fell again to the 
Turks. " It is in vain for you to fpeak (faid 
" he, when he had concluded his bargain) 
" whatever I command fliall be done; and 
" fmce they have ncgledled to provide money, 
" their women fhail go. This will teach them 
*' to be more diligent another time. They

the. Jews, who drew out the number they had 
bought, and, paying down their pri e, drove 
thetn away, without the leall; regard to their 
cries and diflrefs at this violation of all the 
tendereft ties of nature. 
The horror I felt at this abominable tyran- 
ny is not to be expreflbd ; nor the gratitude

Account of an uncommon kind of council ; ^uith 
its natural conclufion, 
WHEN this important affair was finifhed, 
the nobleman fet out for the convention 
of the ftates, with a numerous and grand reti- 
nue. The country through which he travelled 
bore every-where the fame appearance with his 
own territories ; the vafTals in the moft abje6l 
llavery and wretchednefs, and their tyrants in 
flovenly profufion, and aukward fplendor. 
The convention to which the nobles were all 
at this time going, was one of the mod glaring 
inftances of human abfurdity. It was held in 
a large plain, where all thefe petty tyrants met 
on horfe-back, armed, and at the head of their 
vafTals, under the fpecious pretext of delibera- 
ting on the public welfare; but how likely they 
were to promote it is fafficiently obvious : for if 
the voice of reafon is feldom heard with refpe6l 
in the beft regulated afl'emblies, and among the 
mod: civilized people, where every precaution 
which human prudence can fuggeft is taken, to 
prevent the animofity infeparable from dif- 
ference of fentiment, from breaking out into a6ls 
of violence, what muft be expecSled from a num- 
ber of men like thefe, bred up in lawlefs info- 
lence and outrage, and gathering together with- 
out a rule to direct, or power tocontroul them, 
prepared to fupport their own opinions by force 
when 
THE R E V E R I K 167 
^hen Tirguments (liould fail, let them never be 
fo extravagant and iinjullj w^hat, I fay, muft 
be expected from fuch a meeting but tumult, 
confuiion, and llaughter? 
This confcquence was fo well known to their 
fovereigns, that, although they could not ab- 
rogate a cuRom hallowed by its antiquity, 
whofe fancTcion too often makes abfurdity vene- 
rable, and which owed its rife to the moft bar- 
barous ignorance, they never would confent to 
fo dangerous and inefFetSlual an expedient, ex- 
cept in times of public calamity, when their 
licentious fubjc(5ls extorted fuch a conceilion 
from them ; for the right of convening thera 
was entirely in the fovereign, from whom the 
fuprcme power in its utmoft latitude was tranf- 
ferred to the colle61ive body of the nobles the 
moment they met, and for the time of their 
continuing together ; which, however, was al- 
ways limited to one day, to obviate their abu- 
fing their truft. 
They affembled accordingly at fun-rife, and 
fcparating from their attendants, who flood 
around them at feme little diftance, waited for 
thearrival of their fovereign, to explain to them in 
■form the caufe of his fummoning them to meet. 
The time of their waiting was fpent in forming 
cabals, fomenting their mutual difcontents, 
and ftimulating each other to fedition, by ag- 
gravating every exertion of the royal authority 
into a breach of their privlledges, lind an en- 
croachment on the liberty of the public ; in 
behalf of which they declaimed with as much 
vehemence as if they were refolved to baniih 
tyranny from the face of the earth, and reftore 
iill mankind to their original equality. 
5 At 
r68 THE REVERIE. 
At length the fovereign appeared in a mag* 
nificence almoft exceeding imagination; but 
liis looks {hewed that grandeur often gilds 
unhappinefs. Advancing into the midft of the 
affembly, he opened the convention with a 
moft affe£ling fpeech, in which he fet forth the 
public diftrefles in the moft lively and pathe- 
tic colours ; and defired their afliftance to re- 
medy them, with as much condefcenfion as 
was confiftent with the dignity of his rank. 
But it was far from their intention to com- 
ply with any thing he fhould require : they 
icarce gave him liberty to finifh his fpeech, 
when, throwing off all refpe6t andreftraint, an 
hundred mouths opened upon him at once, ac- 
cufmg him of being the caufe of all the public 
calamities, by the weak and pernicious mea- 
fures of his government ; and upbraiding him 
with tyranny, and a defign of overturning the 
liberties of his fubjecSls, which he had fworn to 
maintain. 
The fovereign, unable to prevent, and, un- 
willing to hear fuch indignities, thought pro- 
per to retire, and leave them, to purfue their 
deliberations among themfelves, from which he 
had never expedted any advantage, though their 
clamours had obliged him to call them toge- 
ther. The event was v/hat reafon muft eafily 
forefee. All was tumult, riot, and confufion. 
Every one fpnke at once ; and though in the 
main they all intended the fame thing, which 
was to dethrone their fovereign, that they 
might adl their ravages with impunity, till 
another could be eleSted ; their ungoverned 
heat and impatience defeated their defign, and 
made them fall into the fnares of fome who 
were

were his friends, who defignedly raifed a quar- 
rel in which all took, part.j and in their mad- 
nefs fell to fighting, they kney knew not for 
what, nor cared with whom, without a poffi- 
bility of their being calmed to conclude upon 
2.ny thing. Their attendants, whom they 
brouo-ht to awe their fovereio-n, thinkino: it 
their duty to afTift their lords, joined in the 
fray, which foon became more horrible than 
any pitched battle, every one murdering his 
neighbour without diftindiion of friend or foe. 
Nigiit at length feparatcd the furvivors, wlio, 
without ever enquiring what had been the caufe 
of the quarrel, returned to their refpedlive 
homes, enflamed with the mod virulent ani- 
mofity againil each other, wh'ch they wreak- 
ed with a fury that aggravated the public cala- 
mities a thoufand-fold. 
T]>e confcqucnce of this condant end of thofc 
meetings, and which only could induce the fove- 
reign to fubmit to the hard expedient of per- 
mitting them, was, that it generally delivered 
him from a great part of his enemies, and di- 
verting the rage of the reft from him for a time, 
left him at liberty to purfue his own meafures, 
with whatever friends he had been able to at- 
tach to him; for all their power ended with 
the day, they having no right to meet again 
without a new fummons, which fuch an event 
gave him juft reafon to refufe, could they even- 
be reconciled among themfelves to require it. 
From this horrid fcene I went to court, wi'h 
one of thofe who had firft began the quarref ; 
, and having flipped out of the danger, as foon 
as he had fet them together by the cars, haf- 
tened, as foon as all was over, to give an r.c-

count of the event to the minlfter. The plea- 
iiire with which the latter received the fhock* 
ing detail was painful to humanity to behold. 
me made it be repeated to him over and over, 
that he might not lofe the minuteil: circum- 
ilance, and then went with the pleafmg news 
to his m after. 
The moment he came into his prefence, "I 
*'"' congratulate your majefty (faid he, with an 
*' air of exultation) on the event of the con- 
*' vention. It has concluded properly in a 
" general broil, in which the greateft part of 
^^ your enemies have met the fate they de- 
■" ferved." 
High as the triumph of the minlfter was, he 
could not communicate his joy to his mafter. 
*' It is a melancholy cafe (anfwered the king, 
^' with a deep-drawn figh) that afovereign, who 
" ought to be the father of his people, and ftu- 
*' dy only their happinefs, fhould have reafon 
" to hear fuch an horrid account with plea-

"I have often told your majefty, (replied

which marked the looks of the latter, that my 
cariofity led me to take a view of both their 
L'hara^Lers, that 1 might fee by what means it 
had been obtained. 
The prince was defcending fafl: into the vale 
of years. He looked dejecSted, and melancho- 
]y had thrown over his whole appearance a veil 
of lilllefsncfs and diffidence, whofe gloom ob- 
fcurcd the luftre of his virtues. 
Born to the fovcreignty of dominions on 
which nature had 'beftowed lte bleffings with

been exerted to improve thefii oy every afTift-

his mofl fanguine hopes; encouraged by his 
fmiles genius raifed its head in his court, and 
every finer art flouriflied in the funfhine of his 
favour.

day ; but ambition foon overcaft its radiance, 
..and he forfeited thofe folid advantages, to grafp '

good, without being warned hy the fate of hh 
father, who had fliip-wrecked his happinefs on 
the fame rock. 
Adorned with every virtue that dignifies hu- 
manity, he feemed defigned by Heaven to 
make his people happy; but the excefs even of 
thefe virtues produced the contrary efFcdl. He 
had contraded an intimacy in his earHeft youth, 
when the tender mind receives the itrongeft imr- 
prefTions, with his prefent minifter, who was 
placed in an honourable employment about his 
perfon by the king his fath-^r. 
The fuperiority which a few years ad vanes 
gives in the beginning of life, generally im- 
prints a refpeft difficult to be got over ever af- 
ter. This perfon was blefied with every quali- 
iication which nature could beflow, to improve 
the advantages of his fituation ; nor v/anted ad- 
drefs and care to exert, them in their utmoii 
force. He foon attached the infant fondncfs of 
his young mafter by every pleafing art, and, 
as his reafonbegan, to expand itfelf, attradled 
the refpe6t of that alio, by difplaying his own 
fuperiority in the moil flriking though delicate 
light. 
The talents and difpofition of the prince were 
fuch as, in the general fenfe of the world, de- 
nominated him rather good than great ; whereas 
thofe of his favourite, on the contrary, were all 
of the other kind, and calculated to make a 
noife and figure in the higheft fcenes of life. 
In a good mind friendship often arifes from 
the fame caufe which would have produced en- 
vy in one of a different caft. The prince ad- 
mired the qualities which he was confjious he 
wanted himfelf; and as they were never often- 
l 3 tatioufly 
174 THE R E V E R I E.. 
tatioufiy fhewn in oppofition to him, foon con^ 
ceived the ftrongeft efteem for their owne% 
and refolved to reap the henefit of them, by at- 
taching him to his intereft., The other, who 
foon faw the fuccefs of his hopes, omitted no- 
thing that could poiTibly iniprove the infiuence 
he had acquired. He ftudied every turn of his 
temper, and read his inch nations as foon as 
they arofe ; fo that he was able to anticipate 
his very wifhes. 
But the principal thing that eflablifhcd his^ 
afcendancy beyond a pofiibility of being fup- 
planted, was the perfonal attachment, which-, 
he fhev/ed upon every occafion for bis mafter, 
whofe pleafure appeared to be the only objcdl: of 
his attention and regard ; and to which he was 
ready to facrifice the ftrongeft ties of nature. 
Of this he had had the good fortune to give an. 
early inftance of fuch a nature, as made reafon 
and paflion equally join to confirm his empire 
over the prince's heart. 
He had fallen in Love with a moft beautiful' 
and accomplished young lady, heirefs to one of 
the richeft nobles of the kingdom, and was fo 
happy as to have his paflion not only returned 
by her, but alfo approved of by her father. 
In the overflowing of his heart, on this joy- 
ful occafion, he defcribed his intended bride in 
fuch rapturous terms to the plince, that he rai- 
fed his curiofity to fee her, v/hen her charms, 
made fuch an impreffion upon his heart, natur- 
ally fufccptible of every warm fenfation, that 
he could not refrain from gazing at her with. 
an earneftnefs too plain to be mifunderftood, 
though refpe£t reftrained them from feeming to 
take notice of it. Inattentive to the confe- 
quencq 
THE REVERIE. 17,5. 
quence of fuch an indulgence, the prince re- 
peated his vifits fo frequently, that the lovers 
took the alarm, and {he feigned fickncfs, to 
waive an honour which began to give them 
pain. 
Themanner in which lie informed theprince 
of her illnefs opened his eyes to the nature of 
it. He took the hint in a proper li^ht; and, as 
he had never had any particular defign in vifit— 
ing her, found no diilkulty in refolving to go 
no more. But it was eafier to form than kce^^ 
fuch a refolution. Her beauty had taken 
too ftrong poUefTion of his heart to be fo eafi- 
ly expelled, and he was actually in love, with- 
out having fufpecled any fuch thing. 
As refp'eil had made the favourite conceal 
his fears, fo delicacy kept the prince in filencc 
alfo. He refolved to fubduc his pajfnon, how- 
ever difficult the attempt ; nor would feem to 
underftand a fufpicion that implied a doubt of 
his generofity. But his behaviour foon be- 
trayed the conflict In his breaft. He grew me- 
lancholy, fought retirement, and particularly 
avoided the company of his favourite, v.hofe 
happinefs, though he would not obftrucSl, he 
could not think of, without pain. 
The other immediately perceived the criti- 
calnefs of his fituation, and was in the higheft. 
diftrefs how to a6t between love and ambi^ 
tion ; for he too plainly faw that 0112 muft be 
facriliced, to fecurc the other. While he was 
in this fufpence, an unexpedled event decided' 
the difficulty. 
The king, whofe age had not cooled his paf- 
fion, happened one day to fpeak warmly in 
praife of the young lady's beauty; her lover, 
I 4 who

v/ho v/as prefent, v/as fufficiently acquainted 
v/ith his temper, to fee the confequence of this» 
He knew that he had been all his life a profef- 
fcd votary of love, and had never flopped at any 
thing, however unju{li^lable. to gratify his de- 
iires. Convinced, therefore, that he muft ine- 
vitably lofe his miflrefs, his ready genius fug- 
gefled it to him to difpcfe of her in fuch a 
manner as Oiould turn the lofs to his advan- 
tage. He rnfrantly waited upon the prince, 
and throwing himfelf at his fc^t, with an air of 
the moil psffionate and refpedful tendernefs, 
*' What (faid he) is the caufe of this gloom 
" which hangs upon my prince's brow ? What 
*' uneafmcfs preys upon his heart, which he 
*' canceals from his faithful and devoted fervant ? 
*-^ Say, I conjure you, is there anyremedy in my 
** power to procure ? If my life, if any thing 
*' dearer than my life can give you but a mo- 
" ment's pleafure, fpeak, and you fharl fee tb^t 
" I hold nothing in competition with it." 
The prince was fo ftruck with this unex- 
pected addrefs, that he had no power to make 
any anfv/er ; but his filence fufficiently expref- 
fed what the other wanted. " It is fo, (conti- 
' nued he, embracing his knees in a well-feig- 
" ned rapture) my anxious heart divined aright; 
*' tli-e charms of Lonifa have attraCled your re- 
" gard. Take her ; and may you both be hap- 
*' py. I refign her to a worthier lover. Let 
*' what w^ili be my fate, my happinefs fhall ne- 
'' ver interfere with yours." 
It is im.poffible to exprefs what the prince 
felt at fuch an exalted inftance of regaid. He 
raifed him from the ground, and embracing 
him tenderly, ^'-Noj my dear baron ! (foid he, 
"as.

*' as foon as he could fpeak) I cannot, will 
" not put your attachment to fuch a fevere 
'* trial. The very offer you have made is a 
" pain to me to hear; and I were the moft un- 
'^ generous of men, fhould I take advantage of 
" it." 
Thefewordsj^but a few hours before, would 
have made the baron happy ; but circumf{:ances 
were altered now, and he was refolved to com- 
plete the obligation, by appearing to beftow 
what he could not keep. He therefore repeated 
his offer fo ilrongly, that he. at length fubdued 
all the prince's fcruples, and brought him to a 
compliance which his heart panted for.

BUT this was much the eafieft part of bis 
undertaking. The prince's mclinacions 
ajTifled his arguments, but his miftrefs's were 
on the oppofite fide. She really loved him, 
and had befide fo high a fenfe of honour and 
virtue, that it feemed in vain to attempt per- 
fuading her t'* take a ftep fo contrary to her 
principles, and fo dciiruclive to her paffion.

ties. He had conquered his own lovz^ and his

to make him defpair of the fame fuccefs v/ith

he neceflary to fave appearances. He went to 
her, therefore, directly, when he left the prince, 
and putting on an air of the deepefl: diftrefs, on 
her inquiring tenderly what ailed him, buril in- 
to a Hood of tears, and turned fjcom her j the 
xegret which he really felt at the thought of 
iohng her affifting his defign. 
Struck, with fuch ftrange behaviour, (he ea-- 
gerly afked him what could be the matter? 
when, looking wifhfully in her face for fome 
moments, "OLouifa! (faid he) muft 1 lofe 
*' you? Why have I. not power to fupport my- 
*' rightagainft the lav. lefsinvafions of tyranny? " 
" Good Heaven ! (exclaimed fhe, terrified 
* and amazed) What can you mean? What 
*' tyrant invades your right? Or, who fhould 
*' take me from you?" 
** And have you not heard of it then? (faid 
** he) Has not the mandate yet arrived, that is 
" to tear you for ever from my arms ? Give 
*' orders to be denied to every one, even to the 
*' king. Let them fay you are fick, confined

*' being feen. I muft leave you now; but I 
*' v^rill return, privately, in half an hour, when 
*' it will be dark, and unfold the whole of our 
*' misfortunes to you." Saying this, he left 
her abruptly, with all the appearance of dif- 
traftion and defpair. 
The ailonifhment and terror with which this 
ftruck the lady, may be eafily conceived. 
She inilantly gave the orders he defi.ed, and 
withdrew to her chamber, where fhe v/aited 
for his return, with the moft anxious impa- 
tience. At length he came ; and, being admit- 
ted wi'th every alarming circumflance, of cau^

tion and fear, after fome mofl paffionate excla- 
mations at the feverity of his fate, he acquaint- 
ed her .of the king's having unhappily taken a 
liking to her ; the confequence of which was, 
that he would certainly enjoy her either by per- 
fualion or force. 
The charader of the king made fuch a frory 
too probable, efpecially as a woman wants but 
little proof of the power of her beauty. She 
feemed aftoniflied at the news, and exprefied 
the flrongeft concern ; but vanity gliflcncd 
through her grief, and the many and particu- 
lar queftions which fhe alked betraved a levi- 
ty at leaft, which ieflened her in her lover's 
eyes. 
As foon as flie had recovered herfelf, hov/- 
cver, from the firft emotions of her furprize, 
fhe afked if there was no v/ay of efcaping fuch 
a misfortune? and even propofed an immediate 
marriage, to prevent it 3 but he replied, that 
fuch a rafh expedient would only provoke the 
king's refentment to his ruin, withoi;t being 
any protedion to her, as he had fhewcd on 
many occafions, that he made light even of^ 
that facred tie, vvhen it interfered with his plea-

" heart doats on you." Then feeing' that

'* (continued he) this inftant, and refign my 
" pretcnfions to him ; and" make him believe 
'* ihat I facrifice to his favour what is the ef-

** Take care to be denied by every-one but 
'^ him." 
The fituation in which he left her is hard 
to hz defcrlbed. Her love for the baron, her 
principles of honour and virtue, all refifted the 
complying wi.h the prince ; but, on the oppo- 
iite .hand, there was no other way of efcaping 
from 
tS2 the R eve RLE. 
from his father ; and the baron's making the 
propofal raifed a refentment that almoft'^bal- 
lanced her paffion for him j for fhe would have 
had him meet ruin rather than think of paitino-. 
with her. - ^ 
In this diftrefs, fhe formed a thoufand dif- 
ferent refolutions ; but was ftill unrefolved till 
the arrival of the prince decided the conflict  
when the reluctance v/ith which fhe yielded 
confirmed him in the opinion of her love for 
the baron, and confequently of the greatnefs of 
the facrifice he had made to him^ to prevent 
the leflenlng the merit of which, by a difco- 
veryof the motive, the latter took care to make 
the prince's amour immediately public ; which 
prevented the king's taking any farther notice 
of her. 
This affair, which in the beginning threats- 
ened to ruin the baron in the prince's favour 
by this prudent management fecured it to him 
for ever. He thought it impofilble that a man 
who had made fuch a facriiice to him, ihould 
not be as faithful to his intereft in every in- - 
fiance ; and the king, his father, foon after dy- - 
ing, he religned the reins of goverrmient abr 
folutely into his hands.

Myftery of favour itifm concluded. The neccjfary 
efft^s of ridicule. Minijhrial ufe of unli- 
rnitcd power ; ivith the natural confcquence ef 
ill-placed confidence, 
THE firft ufe which the new minifter 
made of his power was, to travcrfe the 
mcafuies, and remove all the minifters of the 
late king. To reconcile his mafler to a flep 
fo contrary to the natural mildnefs and bene 
^ volence of his temper, he had long taken every 
occafion to decry the underftanding of the late 
king, and turn all his ways into ridicule. 
Every man has peculiarities which will not bear 
to be fhev/n feparatcly, and in an unfavourable 
light. Not confidering that he was guilty of 
many, equally inconfillent, and reprehenfiblc, 
the young king had infenfibly accuilomed him- 
felf to nnd fault with, and deriile the oddities 
N and foibles of his father, which his favourite 
was never weary of difplaying in the muft lu- 
dicrous light. 
The iling of ridicule is always poifoned. 
Though the wound it niarks is at firft fo Hight 
as even to be over-looked, the deadly venom 
foon fpreads through the whole body, and in- 
fe6ls the moft diftant parts. From laughing at 
the late king's foibles, the tranfition was ^-Sy 
to hold his moft ferious nieaiures in contempt. 
He that was a fool in Oi-e thing, could not 
be wife in any \ nor vrerc the fervanti;, who 
could 
i?4 THE REVERIE. 
could proftitute themfelves fo far as to mi*- 
nifler to his folly, worthy of truft from a wifer 
mafter. 
The court immediately afTumed a new ap- 
pearance. Every office of honour and profit vv^is 
filled with the minifter's creatures ; while the 
king, who faw only with his favourite's eyes, 
looked fo coldly on all who difdained to enter 
themfelves into that ignominious lift, that they 
forebore coming into his prefence, where they 
were fure of being infulted by thofe whom but 
a little before they would have fcorned even to 
fpeak to; and left him invironed With a mer- 
cenary band, joined by their common intereft 
in a confederacy, to keep honour, truth, and 
juftice at a diftance from the throne. 
In the mean time, the minifter was not at a 
lofs how to maintain the influence he had ac- 
quired. He flattered the king's tafte for plea- 
lure and magnificence, and diverted his atten- 
tion from everything that looked like bufinefs; 
embarraffing with innumerable difficulties every 
motion which he did not immediately fuggelt 
himfelf ; while he contrived, fo, as that all his 
cwn fchemes met the readieft fuccefs. 
The importance which this management gave 
him, with a prince naturally indolent and vo- . 
Saptuous, is obvious. Sure to be gratified in 
every thing he liked, he thought himfelf happy 
in having one upon whom he could fo entirely 
depend, to eafe him of the cares and fatigues 
of government. Not that his miniller prefumed 
to obtrude his opinions directly, or.feem to 
dictate to his mafter; on the contrary, he.in- 
fmuated his fentiments with fuch delicacy and . 
addrefs, that the king miitook them for his , 
owi.v.^ 
THE REVERIE. 185 
®wn, and imagined he governed the man who 
directed his very thoughts. 
But this happineis was far from being folid. 
The affeiiions of the nobles, who were the 
real ornaments and fupport of the throne, v/ere 
alienated from their fovereign, by a partiality 
equally injudicious and difgraceful ; and the 
people, who fiiw the taxes under which they 
groaned, and which were more than they were 
able to bear, lavifhed upon an infolentiavo'.iritc 
and his greedy followers, fwclled with difcon- 
tent and indignation, which threatened to burft 
in a ftorm that (hould jQiake the throne; while 
the minifter, as if he v/as impatient for his fate, 
lived in a magnificence that exceeded even thsJ: 
of his fovereign, and was an infult to their mir 
fery. 
Nor did he flop here. Scorning to have the 
effeds of his power confined within his mafter's 
dominions, he madly involved himfelf in the 
intrigues of the neighbouring princes, and en- 
tered unprepared into a war in which he had 
no concern. The confequcnce was what rea- 
fon mio;ht have forefeen. His fovereigjn was 
driven from his capital, his country was laid 
wafle, his cities plundered; his palaces, on 
which he had expended fo much care and coft, 
fpoiled of all their magnificence and riches, 
and his fubje^ls compelled to ferve in the ar- 
mies of his enemies ; and, to compleat his m.if- 
fortunes, his reception from thofe to whom he 
fled for refuo;e, cold and infolent to fuch a de^ 
gree as gave him too jull: reafon to apprehend 
their proceeding to actual rebellion, and tear-r 
ino; the crown from his head. Yet amid all 
dm ruin, though evidently the confequence of 
i86 THE REVERIE, 
his favourite's counfels, the latter ftill preierveci 
his afcendency by the fame flattery which iirft 
acquired it, and made him perfifi in his wild 
fchemes, chufmg that he fhould plunge into 
the gulph to the brink of which he had brought 
him, rather than enter into meafures of accom- 
modation, in the courfe of which his eyesmi*ht 
be opened, and his indignation raifed to deliver 
himfelf from fuch a frate of llavery, and take 
the reins of government out of fuch unworthy 
hands. 
" Unhappy is the people (faid I to myfelf,. 
*' (hocked at fo grofs an infatuation) whofe

*' is the king who lets another ftand between 
*' him and his people ; who fees not with his.,

*' in a {late of darknefs and delufion, till he is .

entrance of the minifter to his fovereign. " I

The 
THE REVERIE. 189 
The flrft thing that {Iruck me, on my arri- 
val, was the poverty in which the middle and 
lower ranks of the people lived. The red 
wants of nature are very few ; but the convc- 
niencies which human ingenuity has difcoyered 
to make life more agreeable, ( I fpeak not of 
the vitiated cravings of luxury) and which 
cuftom has made almoft indifpenfible, compre- 
hend a wider circle. Of thefe they were in a 
manner as utterly deflitute, as if they were 
incapable of the arts which could procure 
them. 
The compaffion, which fuch a flate of 
wretchcdiiefs muft naturilly raife, was foon 
turned into contempt, when it appeared to 
proceed wholly from thcmfelvcs. 1 he face of 
the country fliewed that nature had mofl am- 
ply done her part to make the inhabitants hap- 
pv ; but every afliftance of their ovv'n was want- 
ing : and after a long and profound peace, the 
defe(5i:s of idlcnefs equalled the ravages of war 
in other countries. The lands were unculti- 
tivated, the cities in ruins, and the people 
wretched. Yet, amid all this, a pride pecu- 
liar to themfeives appeared in every word and 
adion, that made their mlfery ridiculous ; but 
then at the fame time it alfo enabled them to 
bear it, by diverting their attention from their 
dillrclies to their imaginary importance. They 
looked upon themfeives as fupcrior to the reft 
of mankind ; and in confequence of this opi- 
nion fubmitted without repining; to the fevereft 
wants, rather than debafe theiT dignity by the 
■exercife of any induftry or art. 
. While 
190 THE R E V E R I E. 
While I was making thefe remar4cs, I hap* 
pened to tak6 notice of two men, from whofe 
converfatlon I learned that they were going to 
court. They were Frenchmen, and by their 
equipage and drefs appeared to be perlbns of 
diil:in6tion ; but 1 dire6lly faw through their 
difguiie, that they were eccleriaiiics of the or- 
der of the Jefuits, who concealed their charac- 
ter for a fpeciai purpofe. My opinion of thofe 
religious made me attach myielf to them with- 
out hefitation, as the bell: guides I could pof- 
iibly have. 
When I joined them, they were entering 
the yard of an inn to which they had been di^ 
rented as the befl in the town. At the door 
of it fat a man who appeared to be in the vi- 
gour of life, healthy, flrong, and formed for 
any kind of exercife or labour. Though the 
day was uncommonly hot, he was wrapped 
clofe in his cloak, with one leg thrown care- 
lefsly over the other knee, and his elbow reft- 
ed on a heap of flones, which feemed to have 
been piled up as a buttrefs, to fupport the wali 
of the houfe, while he lolled back, loft in the 
contemplation of his own confequence. 
As the travellers advanced to the door, one 
of their fervants called aloud. The Don, 
without deigning to move a limb, or difcom- 
pofc the gravity of a fingle feature, having eyed 
him for fome time, vouchfafed to afk him what 
he wanted. " We v/ant (anfwered the elder 
" of the two gentlemen) fome body to take 
*' our horfes, and {hew us into the houfe." 
^' Yonder istheftable (repHed the Spaniard, 
^* pointing to an hovel half of which was tum- 
" bled 
T H E R E V E R I E. 191 
^' bled down and the reft ready to follow,) you 
*' may put your horfes there, and by that time 
■'''' the people of the houfe may be at Icifure to 
" come to you." 
" At ieifure ! (returned the gentleman im- 
" patiently) is not this an inn ?'' Then calling 
'' again, an old woman half naked came out, 
^^ and going to take his horfe ; " What, woman, 
*' (continued he, vexed at being kept broiling 
*' fo long in the heat) is there no other fervant 
" befide you ? Where is the mafter of the 
'^ houfe ?"■ 
"Here I am (anfwered the Don, rifmg de- 
^' liberately and adjufting his whifkers) what 
*' is your bufmefs with me ? I fuppofe you do 
** not expecSlthatI fhould wait upon you ?" 
"By no means, fn*, (faid the other, who 
did not delire any altercation with fuch an 
adverfary;) I only want to have fome of 
*^ your fervants called." 
" It is very well; (anfwered theHoft) the 
^' woman will put your horfes in the ftable -y and 
■*' you may followme into the houfe." 
The travellers, who dircdlly faw into their 
hoft's characler, thought proper to accept his 
polite invitation ; and attended him into a room, 
the furniture of which confifted of two or three 
broken ftools and an old table ; but the very 
wretchednefs of it proved at this time a con- 
venience ; the cracks in the walls dravi'ing an 
air on every fide, that was the beft refrefhment 
they feemed likely to find in fuch a place. 
When they were feated, the gentlemen 
turned to their hoft, who had not waited for an 
in\'itation to fit down with them, and afked 
.him what they could have for dinner. " Sir, 
5 *' anfwered 
cc 
192 T H E R E V E R I E.  
'^ (anfwered the other) the houfe is plentifully 
" provided with every thing, as my wife will 
'^' infonn you v/hen (he comes ; I mind not 
'' thefe matters." Then ftroaking down his 
whifkers, with great folemnity, *' Pray, gen- 
" tlernen (continued he) what news is there ? I 
" hear the wrath of the king is kindled againft 
'' the Englifh ; and that he is determined to 
'' extirpate their whole nation : It is a glori- 
ous refolution, -and worthy of his power and 
magnanimity. I only wonder, why he has 
" fufFered them upon the earth fo long." 
As he faid this, the miftrefs of the houfe 
entered ; and after the cullomary cant of being 
exhaufted by an extraordinary run of company 
of late, confefled that all her houfe afforded 
was fome bacon and eggs. '' For, (faid Hie) 
" this' unlucky war has ruined us all. V/e 
" ufed to have fifh fit to entertain an Abbct, 
" and flour that made bread white enough for 
'' the king's table ; but now we have nothing 
'' at all. They pretend indeed to comfort us, 
" with leave from the pope to cat flefh ; but 
'' they do not tell us where we {hall get 
'' it. I wifh thofe who advifed his majefly 
** to this war, may be the firll who periili in 
'' it." 
" Silence, woman, and mind your own af- 
" fairs ! (interrupted the hufband, with a tone 
'' of authority) how fliouid you know any 
*' thing of peace or war ? Leave thofe mat- 
*' ters to us, who underfland them." 
His wife obeyed the fovereign mandate with- 
out reply, and retired ; when he, fwelling with 
double importance from fuch a triumph^

As their fumptuous fare required not much 
time for preparation, the entrance of it inter- 
rupted this magnanimous politician here, at 
which he feemeJ not better pleafed than the 
travellers were with their entertainment. 
While they were refrefhing themfelves as 
well as they could, I took the opportunity of 
going to fee the town, the inhabitants of which 
I found moil cxa^lly charatSterized by the inn- 
keeper and his wife ; all thofe who applied to

The flrft fight of the miniller confirmed me 
in this opinion. He was dreiled iji black 
cloaths, whofe hue added a o-Joom of addiLio-

looks and motions, his foul feemed to be 
w^'apped in the moft intenfe thought. His

When the ceremonials of addref; v/ere per-

on bufinefs. " I am come ( faid he) accord-

puffing and blowing on the floor, while the 
king, to (hew his fuperior abilities, and infulfe 
his anta2;onift, gave half a dozen ftrokes more 
by himfelf 
As foon as they had recovered their breathy 
and put on theij cloaths, " May it pleafe your 
" majefty, (faid the minifter, refuming his fo- 
" lemnity) 1 have juft received an account 
" from Portugal. Your invincible arms bear

" Have they (o^ (interrupted his facred ma-

" Your majefty 's army is advancing toward

" is drawn up ready for battle, and I only

Then going into another apartment that 
looked into a clofe court, and leading his mi- 
nifter to the window, " There they are, (con- 
*' tinuedhe, laughing with delight, ashepoint- 
*' ed to a number of cats v/hich were immured

" The red ones are Englifli, the reft are Por-

" Pll attack them direftly. It will be a glo- 
*' rious furprize. While I fhoot with one gun 
*' you Ihall load the other, fo that we'll keep 
" up a conftant fire.'"" 
With thefe words he began the attack, 
fhouting in triumph at every (hot, " There 
*' falls an EngUihman. There a Poi tuguefe !

His heroic majefty carried on his attack in 
this manner with fuch eageinefs, and conti- 
nued it fo long that his minifter was more tired 
of loading for him, than he had been of his 
match at fhuttle-cocK. ; at lengthy obferving

The fmoak of the monarch's artillery, and 
the fcrcaming of the wounded cats making the 
field of battle not a very agreeable place to flay 
in, the^king and his minifter returned to the 
clofet. As foon as the latter had once more 
compofed his features, " May it plcafe your

THE efFe6t which I felt from this change- 
is fcarce to be conceived. The fmile of 
pleafure and complacency that foftened every 
face I faw, foon difpelled the gloom which I 
had contracted in the late folemn fcene, and 
int^cted me alfo to fuch a degree, that my fea- 
tiires 
212 T FI E R E V E R I E. 
tures began infenfibly to relax into a grin, and' 
I could hardly keep my feet from capering as I 
went along with the croud, whom 1 found go- 
ing to pay their court to the king's miftrefs. 
They all flopped in the antichamber to her 
apartments, where they waited with the moft 
complaiflmt patience for the return of the fa- 
voured ^&w who were' admitted into her pre- 
fence, to learn fromthem the modes of thought 
and action which ihe pleafed to prefcribe for the 
day. 
Curious to fee a perfon who was able thus; 
to rule the happinefs of fo m.any, I entered the 
drefnng-room, where I found her at her toi- 
let, attended in a manner that exceeded my 
imagination, accuflomed as I was to uncom- 
mon fcenes. At her feet kneeled a bilhop, 
in all his facred robes, buckling her ihoes. 
The bafon in which Ihe wafhed her hands was 
held by a peer of the firft rank. A counfellor 
of the parliament painted her cheeks. A 
farmer of the revenues fet her jewels in ordver,. 
A general powdered her hair. An admiral tied 
her ribbons ; and, to entertain her, a cardinal 
read a loofe lampoon. 
When this importarft work was finifhed fhe 
arofe, and, rewarding her happy fervants with^ 
a gracious nod, retired with the cardinal into 
another room, to talk upon bufmefs. As foon. 
as they were alone, ^* Your ladyihip, I think, 
*' ( faid the cardinal, laughing ) has been- 
" grandly waited on this morning. Pray, have 
" you the fame attendence everyday?'* 
" If I would receive it, (anfwered fhe) I 
' might have ten times more. There is no- 
*' thing fo fulfome that thofe fycophants wili^ 
«'not. 
THE REVERIE. 213 
'* not fay ; nothing is (o fervile that they will 
*' not do. I know the bafenefs of their fouls, 
** and therefore trample them thus under my 
*' feet, to anticipate the infults which I am 
" fenfible they would heap upon me on any 
*' reverfe of fortune. As they worfliip the fun- 
*' Ihine of court-favour, it is but juit to let 
*' them toil in the heat of it for a Vv''hile." 
" But how did your ladyfhip gather fuch a 
" grouper (interrupted the cardinal, who fcenir 
*' ed not much to like fome part of what file 
" faid, and therefore was defirous to put a ftop 
" to reflections fo general) Almoft every pro- 
" feflion in the fliite had a reprefentative at 
^' your toilet." 
" Yes, (replied llie) and I defign to fetmofl 
*' of thefe reprefentatives at the head of their 
" profeilions too, which was the occafion of 
" my defiring to fee you this mornino:.*' 
" But does your ladyfhip know (faid the 
*^ cardinal) whether they are qualified to fill 
*' thofe places ? Many of them require parti- 
" cular judgment and experience." 
" Qualified ! (interrupted her ladyfhip, with 
^' a contemptuous fmile) Ye^ ; I have taken 
'' care to be fatisfied, that the/ all have the 
■*' qualifications I want ; and as for any other, 
*' they are anfwerable themfelves ; fo let them 
" take care of that. I am to give them all 
^^ their definitive anfwers this morning; fo if 
" you will go into that clofet, you may over- 
^' hear what pafTes, and will be a judge of 
*^ their qualifications." 
The cardinal obeyed; and her ladyfliip ring- 
ing for one of her attendants, ordered him to

let the general know llie was at leifure to fpeak 
with him. 
As foon as he entered, " Well fir, (faid her 
ladyfhip, cutting {hort all complimcntSj and 
entering directly upon bufinefs) I have fpoken 
to the minifter about you, and am forry to 
find there are To many objections made, that 
it v/ill be necefi'ary for me to exert my ut- 
moll intereft to lervc you. Howev^er, as I 
have undertaken it, I will not be foiled." 
*' 1 am under infinite obligation to your la- 
dyfliip, (anfweired the general) and Ihall en- 
deavour to make a return." 
''-Sir, (interrupted fhe) the return I expedl 
is a pun6lual performance of your propofa:! ; 
which was, to give me two thirds of all 
(exclufive of your pay) that you can poffibly 
make by this commiiiiop., as well what you 
can fubftracl from the fiiperfiuous appoint- 
ments of your own army, as the plunder and 
fpoii of the enemies. You remember, fir, 
that this was your ov/n propofal." 
" I do, Madam, ( anfwered he j and fliall 
faithfully perform it, though really the ap- 
pointments of the army at prefent are fo very 
Ihort, and even th-efe fo badly fuppljed, that 
I fear what may be faved from them will not 
arrfwer your expectation, though I will do 
v/hat I can ; in an enemy's country foldiers 
may fliift for themfelves. But whatever this 
falls (hort fliall be made up in the other ar- 
ticle. The enemies have have had a long 
opportunicy to enrich themfelves, which wi'll 
turn out well to your account nov/. I'll 
firip them to the fkin for you. It is good

''^ policy to ruin an enemy's country which wc 
''^ do not defign to keep p'olTcffion of; as it dif- 
''■ ables them from making head again for a 
*' confiderable length of time. I hope alfo to 
*' condudl the niriitary operations of the cani- 
'^ p:tign in fuch a manner, that your ladyfhip 
^' Ihall not be afhamed of having recomrncnd- 
" ed me to the command." 
'* As to that, fn-, (replied fl^e) it is no affair 
^' of mine. You are to take care of that up- 
*' on your own account; and J wifh you may^ 
" if it were only to difappoint the prefages of 
" thofe who oppofed your promotion; fome of 
*' whom went fo far as to fay, that you were 
" dcftitute of e\'ery qualification necefTary for 
" fo important a charge." Saying this, fhe 
turned from him, leaving him to enjoy the plea- 
fure of meditating on her lad: words. 
The departure of the general made way for 
the entrance of the admiral, who was fum- 
moned next, and whom her ladyfhip addrelled 
with as little ceremony as fhe had fhewn to 
the former. 
" You have been recommended to me, fir,

"I am eternally devoted to. your ladyfhip,

" I fhall be fo happy as not to difappoint your

"I

*' I hope not, (replied fhe) and, as 1 con- 
fide in the character given me of you, have 
not yet exprefsly flipulated any conditions 5 
but you muft not imagine upon that account 
that I do not expect any. You know the 
nature of the command which you arc to go 
upon. It is to attack the enemy's trade, 
and plunder their fettlements in thofe places 
where you expect to meet the leaft refiftance. 
Now, fir, in executing fuch a commiiflion 
you muft certainly make many valuable cap- 
tures ; three fourths of the clear produce of 
which I fhall expedt, for procuring you the 
command j the reft you may divide among 
yourfelves. If you approve of this, your 
commiflion fliall be made out directly." 
*' I am too fenfible of your lady fliip's favour, 
(returned he) to diflike any thing you pro- 
pofe. As for m.yfelf, I have nothing in viev/ 
but honour; and that, at le^ift, I fhall have 
an opportunity to acquire." 
"Honour, fir! (interrupted flie haftily) 
How do you mean ? If it is by fighting with 
the fleets of the enemy, you quite miftake 
the matter, Inftead of that, you muft ufe 
all poflible care to avoid them, and not run 
the hazard of difappointing the defign upon 
which you are fent, and lofmg the fleet en- 
trufted to you in attempting to acquire ho- 
nour. Acquire profit, and leave honour to 
the enemy." 
" Yes! But pleafe your ladyfhip, (an- 
fwered the feaman, who did not fo well re- 
lifli the latter part of his inftru6tions) How 
{hall I anfwer that to the king ? I fhaU be

THE REV ERIE. 217 
* Never fear, (replied fhe : ) do you take 
^' care to make a profitable cruize, and I will 
*' protect you from all danger of that kind j 
" and perhaps make intereft alfo to have you . 
'^ fent out again with a greater force, when 
" you fliall not be under a neceility of ob~ 
" ierving fuch caution." Encouraged by this, 
the admiral promifed to obey her orders, and 
went away with an high heart. 
The admiral was fuccceded by the farmer- 
general, who, advancing to her'ladyfhip with 
a confident air, *' I have taken the liberty (faid 
*' he) to brin^ your ladyfhip a fuit of jewels, 
" which I hope you will like. I fliould not 
*^ prefume to offer them, If they were not fit 
^' for the firfc fovereign in Europe to wear." 
" You are always very obliging; (anfwereci 
" herladyfhip, cafting her eye carelefsly upon 
'' the jewels as fhe took them) they are indeed- 
" nrettv enou2:h." ' 
" Your ladyfhip does not fee half their beau- 
^'^ ty; (replied the farmer) if you will pleafcto 
*' look a little clofer, you will have a better 
^' notion of their value." 
*' I beg your pardon, fir, (returned flie, tak- 
" ing notice of the paper they were wrapped in,

' "And you fhall have it, (replied her lady-

*■* proof of their being exhaufbed, indeed ! If 
* they are in want, let the men all lift in the

The counfellor of the parliament fucceeded 
the farmer-general, to whom her ladyfhip ad- 
dreffed herfelf with as little ceremony as the 
.others. "Sir, (faidlhe) I have confiderei of

" lliat's true, (added her ladyfhip, calling.

" Why— -really — (faid he) if your ladyfhip

" Sii», (anfwered flie warmly) I do and will

'* No, Madam ! by no means ! (replied he)

which diretl the condudt of their infe-

^^ Weil I (refiimed her ladyfhip) Do nat 
you think now that all thefe perfons are pro- 
perly qusJiiied for my purpofe? I hold my 
power by a very precarious tenure, and there- 
fore think it prudence to make the moft of 
it while it lafts. What is the intereft or 
honour of the kin2;dom to me ? I know that 
With the king's favour I gained the hatred of 
every other perfon in the kingdom, and that 
on the lofs of that I {hould feel all the weieht 
of the latter; to avoid which I'll take care 
to provide what Ihall make my retreat elfe- 
where comfortable, for I will never ftay a 
mioment after I becom>e fubje6l to their in- 
fuks ; and for that very reafon I fend my mo- 
ney before me as faft as I can." 
" Then your ladyfliip (replied the cardinal) 
is refolved on going to England ! " 
" Moft certainly; (faid fltie) What other 
place could I expe6l the fame fafety or fatis- 
fa6lion in ? A perfon that has but money 
enough to give into the extravagancies of the 
mode will never want an agreeable reception 
there. As to the diiEculty you made about 
going with me, there is nothing in it. There 
will no more objection be made to yourcha-. 
racier than to mine. As foon as the novel- 
ty is worn of}', we fhall pafs as unnoticed as

^ come in England for his money ; fo thnt you 
** need not be fo delicate and timorous, it is 
'^ but laying afide your red hat, and you need 
*' apprehend nothing." 
" Your ladyfliip (anfwercd the cardinal, vAio 
*' did not much tike the manner in which file 
*' fpoke thefe lafi words) cannot think that I 
*■' fnould make any ditficnlty of following you 
" to the remolcfl part of the world. The hap-

" felf ? Thofe I mean whom the importance of 
*' the employments which you defign them for 
*' makes it necefiary to obferve fuch caution 
*' about. There will be o-reat murmuring; at

*' have applied for thofe commands." 
" Let them murmur on ; ( replied fhe haugh- 
" tily) I defpife every thing in their power to

" but you may order their fevcral commiiTions 
" to be got ready in the mean time." ' 
" Really, (returned the cardinal) I think

Their political conference was broken off 
here, by one of a fofter nature. The cardinal 
v/as too gallant not to dedicate fome part of his 
private audience to love, and her iadyfhip too 
tender to refufe his addreffes. After fome time 
fpent in dalliance, the cardinal recollediei that 
the king was by that time returned from hunt- 
ing, and accordingly haftened away to wait 
upon him; while her Iadyfhip prepared to re- 
ceive the vifit which his m:ajeffy never failed 
to pay her every day.

He that throws- dirt nlways- fouls his fingers. 
N my arrival in England, I found niyfelf 
near the feat of a nobleman of th^'firft 
rank, in that part of the ifland which lay next 
to France, not having thought of any particur 
lar place when I ic{/6t^ my felf from thence. 
The largenefs of the hcufe, and the flouri/h- 
ino- condition of the cxtenfive demefne around: 
it, fhcwcd the wealth of the owner, as the 
fmile of content on the faces of his tenants 
proved his generofity and. juftice. Induilry 
procured plenty, and liberty fweetened at the 
lame time that it fecured enjoyment. 
Struck with the contrafi: between this, and 
the fcenes I had lately feen, I fhai'cd fympathc- 
tically in the general joy ; and in the honeft 
pride of my heart. refolved to pleafe myfelf with 
taking a more particular view of the man whofe 
virtues diffufed fuch happinefs around him. But 
what was my furprize and difappointment, to 
iind the profpe6l overcafi: where I expe£ted to 
have fecn it brightclt ! In his oy/n family, and 
where 
ft^atv T H E R E V E R I E; 
where hi& more immediate prefence ftiould have 
operated with the greateft force, ambition had 
b^nifhed harmony, and poifoned every bread 
with animofity and rancour. . 
The flames of this difTention, which had long 
bfeen fmothered, burft out with the moft ri- 
diculous violence^ juft at the time I entered. 
Though fuch a domeftic fcene as this was a 
defcent from thofe great ones which I had 
lately been engaged in obferving; yet, as it 
difplayed the inconfiftency of the human heart . 
in a new light, I thought it merited my atten- 
tion. 
The occafion of the breach was this : One , 
of the lord's agents, who, by the a(5liv.ity and 
fanguinefs of his temper, had in a manner en- 
^rofied the whole management of his mafter's 
affairs, had itaken it in his head to go to law 
with one of the principal gentlemen in the 
neighbourhood, from an apprehenfion that he 
intended to take the. part of ii coufm of his, 
with v/hom his, lordfhip had had a long fuit 
for encroaching upon his fide of the common. 
The agent had conduced this fuit with equal 
judgment and fuccefs, and at a very great ex- 
pence, for it was not his difpofition to fl-arve 
any caufe he took in hand, foiled his adverfa- 
ry in all his attempts, and not only recovered 
from him the places he had unjuflly pofleffed 
himfelf of, but alfo obtained feveral decrees for 
cofts, by which he turned him out of fo many 
other parts of his eftate, that he had not left 
him a penny to fee an attorney to carry on the 
fuit anv longer, though his proud and litigious 
temper would not permit him to give it up. 
Matters 
THE REVERIE. 23;:^ 
Matters were in this fituation, when the 
agent propored filing a bill directly againd' 
the coufin, who (he faid he had received un- 
doubted intelligence) had entered into a pri- 
vate agreement with the'other to fupply him 
with nionev to. q;o on wit'i liis law-fuit, and' 
amft him alTo with his intercfl: to recover 
his lofTcs. This was a direct breach of a 
former agreement between him and his lord- 
ililp, by which he had obliged himfelf not to 
mCddle in the difpute at all j the agent was for 
falling upon him without any ceremony, al> 
kdging, that it was much better to be plaintiff 
than defendant in any fuit ; as nmft certainly 
be their cafe if they were not before-hand v^^ith 
the other, who was at that very time preparing 
to attack them, as appeared by feveral late imr 
fiances of his behaviour. 
To this propofal his lordfhip did not think 
proper to give a determinate anfwcr, till he 
fhould confult with the reft of his tenants and 
fervants ; as, by their leafes, they were all bound 
to defray the expences of any fuits which were 
far the general good of the ellate^ But when 
the agent acquainted them with his defign,. 
though he fupported it with very ftrong rea- 
fons, and which in the fequel proved to be well' 
founded, they were all of a different opinion, 
and faid, it would be very imprudent to en- 
tangle themfelves in a new difpute before they 
_ were out of tlie old, efpecially as they were al- 
ready at a greater expence than they could well 
bear. 
The agent, whofe temper was too warm to 
brook, oppofition, without any refpect to his 
inalkr's prefence, flew into a violent pailion, 
audi 
234 THE R E V E R I E. 
and called them a parcel of poor-fpirited trim- 
ming fellows, who v/ould lofe a pound to favc 
a penny. They were not behind-hand with 
him in abufe, but faid, that he was a hot- 
headed beggarly upftart, who, having no for- 
tune of his own to lofe, cared not what ex- 
pence or danger he drew others into. 
The lord thought it but juft, in fuch a cafe: 
as this, to follow the opinion of the majority, 
and therefore reje6ted the agent's propoial. 
But he did not give k up on that account ; but 
refolved to try another method, bv which he 
did not doubt of carrying his point. The 
great fuccefs with which he had managed his 
mafler's bufinefs, ever fmce he had been em- 
ployed, had made him fuch a favourite with, 
the tenants, and given him befide fo great a 
confequence in his own eyes, that he thought 
his lordfliip could not do without him, and 
would therefore fubmit to any thing rather 
than part with him. Full of this opinion, he 
went to him next morning, and giving him Up 
his keys, in a kind of pet, told him, he was 
forry he could not fcrve his lordlhip any lon- 
ger, as he thought proper to prefer other peo- 
ple's advice to his. 
His lordfhip, as if he had been prepared 
for the thing, received the keys very calm- 
ly, and telling him he was alfo forry to 
lofe fo good an agent, difmifTed him moft po- 
litely, with thanks for his pad: ferviees. 
This was a ftroke the other was not pre- 
pared for. He flood thunder-flruck for fom2 
moments , then, burfting into a flood of tears, 
killed his lordfhip's hand paiTionately, and, 
declaring himfclf overcome by fuch goodnefs^, 
f?id,. 
THE REVERTS;. ^35 
laid, he was ready to fpciid the laft hour of his 
life in the fervice of fo kind a matter. The 
confequencc of this he thought would have 
been, that his lordfhip would directly* return 
him his keys, and rc-inftate him in his employ- 
ment, for he was far enough fron-Kiefigning to 
refign it ; but he found himftlf difappointed m 
this alfo. The lord, much as he valued him 
for his abilities and honeftv, both of which 
were unqucltionablc, had for fome time felt 
the warmth of his temper, not without unca.- 
[mcCs^ and was glad of fo fair an opportunity 
of getting rid of a fervant who had fliewed on 
many occafion, as well as t?his, that he meatvt 
to be matter ; not doubting but he had others 
in his family capable of managing his affairs 
with equal fidelity and judgment. 
The fituation of the late agent on this oc- 
cafion may be eafily conceived. He retired to 
his own houfe, and throwing himfelf on his 
bed, gave his mind up to the moft mortifying 
refledions. But what he felt from his own 
thoughts was nothing to the vexation he re- 
ceived from others. Such an affair could not 
in the nature of things be long kept a fecret. 
The moment it came to the ears of his rela- 
tions, and dependants, that he had lofl his 
employment, they all flocked about him, croak- 
ing like fo many ravens about a carrion; fome 
of them afking impertinent quettions, others 
giving abfurd advice ; this upbraiding him with 
his raflmefs, that accufmg his matter of ingra- 
titude ; and all lamenting the difappointment 
of the hopes they had built on his favour, till 
their noife and nonfenfe quite turned the poor 
man's head 3 the confequence of which was, 
that 
236 THE R E V E R I E. 
that in his delrrlum he wrote a letter to tlW 
dark of the parifh, which he was to read at the 
veftry, giving as a reafon for his throwing up 
Siis employment, that his lordfhip truly would 
no longer -fubmit to be guided by him ; and 
therefore he did not think it proper to ferve 
him any longer. 
This cfFedually clinched the affair. If his 
mafter had even been inclined to over-look 
what had pafTed, and take him into his fervice 
again, the folly and infolence of this letter put 
it out of his power; as it would have been 
plainly acknowledging, that he refigned him- 
felf abfolutcly to his guidance. 
The late agent's enemies did not fail to ex- 
aggerate this unaccountable conduct in the 
moft malicious manner ; but his lord viewed 
it in another light, and juftl) imputing it to 
madnefs, not only took no notice of it, but 
alfo, to '-nmfort him in his diftrefs, generoufly 
gzve V. . i an annuity fufHcient to fupport him 
in t' ank of a gentleman, cxprefsly as a re- 
war' xX)r his paft fervices; and wrote a letter 
with his ov/n hand to his wife, wiio was an^ 
high-fpirited dame, and came from a good fa- 
mily, in which he foothed her vanity, by pay- 
ing her the compliment of calling her a lady. 
Though this a6l of bounty proceeded mecrly 
from the generofity of his lordihip's heart, the 
enemies of the late agent gave it a very diffe- 
rent turn. The fucccfs which the latter had 
had in his bufinefs, and his fan2;'!ir:e profef- 
fions of regard for the intereft of the tenants, . 
had won him their confidence and favour to 
fuch a degree, that thy immediately looked 
upon his giving up his employment as a fign 
THE REVERIE, 237 
that there were fome fchemes to their difad- 
vantage in meditation, which he would not* 
join in; and, coniequently, that their interefts 
would be betrayed, and the law-fuit which he 
had conducted with fo much credit, and 
brought almoft to an happy conclufion, at 
io great an expence, patched up m a paul- 
try manner, and all the money loft. 
To leflen him, therefore, in the opinion of 
the populace, was confidered as the mod: effec- 
tual method to flop their clamors, and difable 
him from making mifchief between them and 
his lordftiip's fervants. For this purpofe, to 
make the news of his having got the annuity - 
foon enough and fufficiently known, the town- 
crier proclaimed it at the market-crofs -, and it 
was immediately infinuated, with the greateft 
induftry, that it was the price of his boafted 
regard to the tenants ; that he had fold his in- 
fluence over them, and engaged to make them 
approve any meafures his lordfhip pleafed, 
however contrary to their intereft and honour. 
But though this ruined his confcquence, it 
was far from having all the efte6l that v/as ex- 
pelled. The tenants feemed refolved to think 
that their intereft was to be facrificed, becaufe 
the pcrfon who fucceeded to the management 
of his lordfhip's bufmefs was' not immediately 
ot' their own chufmg ; and therefore, inftead 
of mindino; their work, and p-oine to nloup-h 
and cart, as they ought to do, they fpent their 
time tippling in alc-houfes, and railing at the 
new agent, even before he had time to do any 
thing that fhould fiiew whether he was capable 
of the bufmefs or not ; and for fear this humour

THE lord, whofe ov/n good-nature made 
him wiih to live in harmony with all the 
world, was greatly vexed at ' fuch fcandalous 
wrangling thus under his nofe -, not that he 
knew it all either : the new agent, who from 
a long acquaintance had a particular influence 
over him, let him hear no more of it than he 
thought proper, contriving to keep every one 
from him who fhould fay a word which he 
did not dictate j fo that his lordlhip was made 
to believe, that all the difturbance and abufe 
came from the other fide, and was levelled at 
him, as well as his fervants.

Though all the fervants were glad of the 
late agent's difgrace, in hopes of fharing fome 
part of that power which he had engrolled fo 
entirely to himfelf, that they were no more 
than meer cyphers in the family, the one who 
rejoiced moii openly, was the old fleward. 
He had been many years a faithful fcrvant, to 
the beil of his knowledge and abilities, to his 
lardfliip's family; and though he was never 
thoue;ht.to he io clear-headed or refolute in the 
fnanagcmcnt of affairs as the late agent, yet he 
was vwy ufefid m fome things. He had made ^ 
a ronfidcrable party among the tenants, for 
this lord's father, when he came firft to the 
cllate, to which he was apprehenfive of hav- 
ino- his title difputed, by the generous manner 
in which he gave his beef and beer among 
them, for he was very well to-pafs in the world, 
and never failed to treat the mob Vv^th a bon- 
fire and a barrel of ftingo every now-and-then; 
.by which meens he alfo won their hearts fo, 
that he had always a party among the parifhi- 
o-ners, to choofc what officers he bade them, 
fo that he was able to carry any point he plea- 
fed at the vcftry, which, to do him juftice, was 
ever what his lordfliip diredcd. 
By this extravagant way of living, it is true, 
he had gone behind-Ii^nd a good deal, but he 
never llopt for that, he had {fill fomething left ; 
and the ftewardfhip, which he had had fo long 
that be looked upon it as his own, brought 
him in a good penny befide, that enabled him 
very well to live on at his old rate. 
The imperious manner in which the late 
agent behaved, had made the fleward long 
wifh to be rid of himj but he did not know 
how

^liow to bririgit about ; and, efpedally at thk 
time, he would not even attempt it, for fear of 
giving any hinderance to his lord's affairs, 
which the other managed fo well : but when 
he faw it thus done to his hand he could not 
contain his joy, but ran up and down to every 
fervant in the houfe, from the butier to the 
fcullion, poking his nofe in their faces, and 
lliaking hands with them on their happy deli- 
-verance. Coming among the reft to the new 
agent, and addreffing him in the fame manner, 
'* My good friend, (returned the latter dryly) 
*' take care. Do not run mad with joy to- 
*'.clay9 nor with grief to-morrow" 
The fteward's heart was too full to take no- 
tice of this fpeech now, but he underftood it 
when it was too late. I have obferved that the 
new agent was in particular favour with his 
lord. Though getting rid of that over-bearing 
wrangler was a great point gained, it was far 
from being all that he had in view. The fce- 
wardfhip was the thing he had fixed his heart 
upon. It was the firft place in rank in the 
fervice.^ and, by the command of the cafli, 
gave a power of every thing to one v/ho had 
fpirit to exert it; which he was refolved to do 
to the utmoft extent, and not be encroached 
upon and brow-beaten by any under-fervant-, 
as the other had been. 
But, though he w^as fure of getting the place 
-from his lord when it fhould be vacant, the 
long fervices of the old fte\v^ard, and the inte- 
reft which his hofpitality had acquired him 
among the tenants, from the wealthieft of 
whom he had alwavs found means to borrow 
any money his lord wanted, till the rents came 
in, 
THE REVERIE. 241 
uv, mtide him think it nccefiary to Jirocccd witli 
addrefs, in getting him turned off. For this 
reafon he paid him uncommon compliments, 
and let him go on juft as he pleafed, in ex- 
-pecSlation of his doing fomething, now that he 
was freed from reftraint, that miaht 2:ive a 
colour for removmg him ; but, whether by- 
chance or defign, he difappointed his fchcmes, 
and proceeded fo regularly that he could take no 
hold of hitn. 
This obliged him to change his mcafures. 
Accordingly he gave orders to the receivers 
under the lleward, (fome of whom,tho' brought 
in by him, and under the greatclf obligations 
to his bounty, bafcly betrayed him, the mo- 
ment they faw him totter in his place) to per- 
plex the bufmefj; of his office as much as pof- 
fible^ and even difpute his orders, wh:ch,v it 
was not do'ibted, would put him off his guard, 
and make him give the advantage that wz'j 
fought for againft him, by doing fomething 
irregular, in his refentment. 
'1 his fcheme had the defu-ed cffe6^, though 
not precifely in the manner that was expec- 
ted. The ileward, ignorant of the fnarc laid 
for him., in the ufual courfeof his bufmefs gave 
one of the attorneys^ concerned in carrying on 
the law-fuit, an order upon the receivers, for 
a fum of money to clear off his bill of cofls. 
The receivers, as they had been directed, made 
a difficulty of paying it without an exprefs or- 
der from his lor.dfhip. This ^^as a dired at- 
tack upon the flev/ard's authority. He ran 
ijiftantly to the lord, and fputtering out his 
flory as well as his paffion would permit him, 
ilemanded that" thofc infolent fellows faould be 
VoL.ir, M dif- 
242 T H E R E V E R I E. 
Hifcharged direOily, or he could not do his ta- 
il nefs any longer. 
The lord, -who by the bye was prepared for 
this fecond part of the agent's farce, anfwered 
him carelefsiy, that he was forry to lofe fo old 
a fervant ; and, turning about, walked away, 
huniminp^ a tune. The lleward, who had lived 
in a kind of familiarity with the late lord, could 
not bear fuch a flight-, he left the room di- 
reilly, and ran about the whole houfc, telling 
every one he met how ill his lordfhip had ufed 
him. 
But he foon found that he had more caufe of 
complaint than he knew of; for the very next 
morning his letter of attorney was fuperfeded, 
and the llewardfhip given to the new agent, 
who thus got the whole bufmefs into his own 
hands, having put a creature of his own into 
the agency, vvho dared not to difobey his or- 
ders in any thing. 
It is hot eafy to defcribe the old fleward's 
:a({:onIfliment at fuch an unexpected ftrokc. 
However, he preferved the dignity of his cha- 
rn<Ster miuch better than the late agent had 
done J for when he waited upon his lordfhip, 
to give him up his keys. Sic. he made no mean 
attempts to recover his favour and keep his 
place ; ^nd when the lord, in the goodnefs of 
his heart, offered him an annuity alfo, being 
unwilling that he fhould want in his old days, 
he rafufed it with dlfdain, declaring it fhould 
jiever be faid, " that old True-penny^ who had 
'" fpcnt fo many pounds in good beef and flrong 
*' beer, in his lordfhip's fervice, was glad to 
^^ take up with a paultry annuity at lafl." 
Such 
THE REVERIE. 143 
Such a return for his labour and expence 
fliould have been fufficient to open his eyes to 
the folly he had been fo long guilty of, and 
have taught him to live frugally and quietly the 
remainder of his days ; but the habit had taken 
too faft hold on hiin to be ever fhaken off* 
The moment he went home to his own houfc, 
he gathered all his old pot-companions and 
trencher-friends about him, and fell to carouf- 
ing as ufual, flattering himfclf with a foolifh 
hope, that the^ would ftand fo firmly by him 
at the next veftry, that his lord (hould not be 
able to have his bufinefs done, and therefore 
mud be glad to give him his place again. 
While he fquandercd 2.\va.y the remains of 
his fubftance in this idle manner, and his new 
friend the late agent (for fociety indifgracehad 
united them) fat brocding over his refentment, 
and meditating fchemes of revenge, the new 
'teward was far from enjoying his triumph in 
happinefs. The fall of his predcccflor, whc» 
had fo lono- thought himfelf as firmly fixed as 
jnan could be, was a warning to him ; and 
tliough he took all poiTible care to fecure him- 
fclf, by filling every place in the fiur.ily, dowR 
to the very liable-boy, with his dependants, 
and letting no body, as I have cbferved be- 
fore, come rear his lord, who he was not fa- 
tisficd was abfolutely in his intereii:, yet his 
fears every moment formed new dangers to 
torment him ; and he could not fee his lord 
fmile upon the mofi: devoted friend he had in 
the world, without feeling a iealoufvof havin^;- 
his own arts played upon himfelf, and being 
fupplanted in his turn^as he had fupplanted the 
others,

However groundlcfs thefe fears were at firff, 
they foon threatened to realize the dangers 
which were only of their own creation. That 
opennefs and gaycty of temper, which iirfl 
gained him his lordlhip's favour, gave place to 
gloomy filence and referve ; and the univerfal 
benevolence and philanthropy which gave ir- 
refiftible charms to his converfation, and com- 
manded the efteem of every good mind, were 
fourcd into jealous envy, and fufpicion, that 
iickened at the mention of a virtuous a6iion.

melancholy reflections; but I Vv^as foon diverted 
fi-om them, by fomething of a lefs ferious na- 
ture. 
The conftable of the village in v/hich the 
lord's houfe Hood, in conformity to old cuftcms, 
made a feall: at this time for his lordihip and 
his whole family, to which he fent them a fo- 
lemn invitation by the parifn-ofFicers. Such 
a fccne promafed fome amufement at leafl. I 
therefore returned with the oiHcers v/ho had 
come upon this important errand, defirous to 
fee the whole procefs of fo extraordinary an 
^fTai ;. 
As 
THE REVERIE. 24s 
As the fcaft v/as to be given at tlie joint ex- 
pcnce of the village, the principal inhabitants 
had aflembled at^thc confrablc's houfe, and 
were fitting over a pet of beer, v/aiting for 
the return of thofe who had been fent with the 
invitation j though the whole was a thing cf 
courfe, their anxiety was fo great that not one 
of them could fpeak a word till their arri\-al : 
the moment they entered the room, all the reft 
laid down their pipes, adjufted their perriwigs, 
and wriggling fheir chairs nearer to the table, 
liftened "to the- account with open mouths, and 
looks of the profoundeit fagacity. 
"' Well, gentlemen, (faid the conftable, who 
" fat in an arm-chair to fhew his authority) 
" fince his lordfhip has condefccnded to accept 
*' of our invitation, we fhould take care that 
*' every thing is prepared in the beft manner 
*' for his reception. There will be many 
" things wanted to make a proper appearance 
" on fuch an occafion, and no one would flop 
" at a trifling expence, efpeclally as the money 
" will be laid out among ourfelves.*' 
This fpeech opened every mouth in the 
room at once. *-' We fhall all want new 
" cloaths," cried the taylor. 
" New fhoes," — faid the fhoe-maker. 
''^ New ftockings," — faid the hofier. 
'' New wii^s,"— faid the barber. 
" Our hordes muft be Ihocd/'— faid the 
farrier. 
" Our houfes repaired," — ^faid the brick- 
layer.

ney- fweeper.

curate. 
" A fpeech,"^ — laid the veftry-clerk. 
" A vomit, in cafe \)f repletion," — faid" 
the do6lor. 
■ '' A clyfter," — faid the apothecary. 
'' A coffin," faid the wndertaker. In 
fliort, every perfon prefent afi'erted the want of 
foinething in his own v/ay, to make the en- 
tertainment compleat ; and the lefs necefTary 
it was, the louder they roared. 
When they had ^11 bawled themfelves hoarfe^ 
and the conftable, by repeated thumps with his 
iiil upon the table, obtained leave to fpeak,. 
" Silence, gentlemen, (faid he) we fhall never 
'' do any thing at this rate. You are all for 
'' providing other things before we have fixed 
*' upon the victuals. Let us fettle about them 
*' firil." 
This word raifed a tumult, ten times greater 
than the former; everyone in the room roaring 
out at once for fome particular diih, either that 
it was his trade to provide, or which he was 
fond of himfelf. 
The butcher bawled out. Beef. —  
The poulterer, fowls. —

— " A turtle," — faid an alderman.

— " Pickled herrings," — belched Mynheer.

— *' An haggis," — faid a Scot. 
— '* Leek-pottage," — fputtered TafFy. In a 
wordj 
THE REVERIE. ^47 
word, they all ralfed their voices with iach ve- 
hemence, not one attending to what another 
faid, that, lince the buildmg of Babel, theie 
was not fuch a fcene of confuiion. 
At length, the conteft i2;rew fo hi2;h that 
they were juft ready to fall together by the 
ears, when the conftable, who fat all the while 
fretting his guts to fiddle-ftrings at this inter- 
ruption of his fpeech, which he loolced upon 
as an irifult to his authority, put a ftop to the 
whole tumult, by an accident. " Fire and fury ! 
*' (exclaimed he, raifmg his voice as loud as 
" ever he was able) Are you all mad ? " 
The word j^rt', which v/as all they attended 
to, filled them with aftright. They thought 
the houfc was on fire, and repeating the cry 
with equal vehemence, they overturned the 
table, fpilled the beer, and tumbling over one 
another, made the beft of their way out. 
As foon as they were undeceived, they re- 
turned into the room, and having recovered 
thcmfelves a little by the help of a trefli fupply 
from the ale-houfe, the conitable, compofmg 
himfelf into proper dignity, refumed his fpeech : 
" I fay, gentlemen, (faid he) that, if we go on 
'' in this manner, it is impoffible for us tocon- 
*' du(Sl: this affair with due decorum. We had 
* better chufe out a fet of us who underftand 
f ' thefe matters, to agree upon what is proper ; 
*' andbecaufe there will be a great many things 
*' wanted befide vifluals and drink, that no 
*' bufinefs fliould be overlooked, it will be right 
*' to have one of every trade chofen, and then 
*' there can be no miftakes." 
This motion was univerfaliy approved, and 
accordingly they proceeded directly to make the 
M 4 choice ; 
245 THE REVERT E. 
choice; but in this they were very near fallinj^ 
into as great confiifion as before, every one 
being; ambitious of the honour. At lenp-th, 
however, and with difEcult'/, it v/as fettled; 
and then the felecled few withdrev/ to the next 
ale-houfe, to coiifult undidurbed upon the af- 
fair. 
When they were fcated and had frnoaked a 
whiff or tv/o, to lettle their heads, the confta- 
ble, wlio by his office v/as one of the number, 
opened their dehberations." " Gentlemen, 
*' (faid he, puiHng out a pillar of fmoak) I be- 
*' lieve I may fay, without vanity, that there is 
*' no one In this company who underftands 
*' thefe matters better than I do : I keep a good 
" houfe myfelf, an hot joint every day, and 
*^ roaft and boiled, both, on fundays; befide, 
*' my wife, it is well knov/n, was bred up in a 
*' gentleman's family, and there learned apro- 
" per notion of doing things genteely. It is my 
*' opinion, therefore, that you leave the whole' 
" to me, and I will prevail upon her to give. 
*' me advice." 
'' With your leave, Mr. conftable, fanfvver- 
'' ed a pcrfon who iat oppofite to him, and 
" heard him out with great impatience) though 
" it be your luck to be in office this year, there 
*' are others in the parifh who keep as good 
*' houfes as you; and I believe my dame alfor 
^' has as good an opportunity of knowing thefe 
'' matters as another : I ferve two or three 
*' gentlemen who keep French cooks, and fne 
'' never goes to their houfes with goods, that 
" fhe does not learn fome new piece of cook- 
*' ery from them ; for {he is a well-fpoken bo- 
** d.'j^ and always aikeci to fit down among the

THE REVERIE. 249 
" upper fervants; and then (he isfo fond of 
" pradifmg what {he thus picks up, that I 
" hardly ever know the name of v/hat I eat ; 
*' but fhe tells me they are quite the mode, and 
*' fo I fubmit; though, in truth, I cannot fay 
*' but I fh?uld often 4^refer a cut of honeft old 
" England ; in my opinion, thcic is nothing 
*' beats a roafc fir-loin." 
This eloquent fpeech was followed by one 
as eloquent from every one prefent, declaring 
his own ability for this important affair, and 
putting in his claim to it. At length, when 
all law that not one would give up his preten- 
ficns to another, they came to an agreement, 
that each fnould drav/ a bill of fare according 
to his tafle and judgment, out of v.'hich the)'- 
imagined they fhould certainly be able to make 
a proper choice. 
Accordingly, they all went to work ; and the 
ftreams which flowed from every mouth, while 
they were writing, proved with what candour 
they fetdovv'n the things they liked befl, and 
bow glad they fliould be to cat them. 
The bills of fare, produced upon this occa- 
fion, fliewed that the Englidi were not dege- 
nerated, in their ftomachs at leafl:, from their 
miglny anceftcrs. Buttocks upon buttocks, 
and firloins without number. — Legs of pork, 
and faddles of mutton. Fillets of veal and 
flitches of bacon. Hams by the dozea, and 
fowls by the grcce. Flocks of gcefe, and 
droves of turkies. In fl-iort, the quantises 
of meat, when the bills were all re:,d over to- 
gether, turned the flomach cf every one pre- 
ient, and made them readily accept the propo- 
fal of the man of the houfe, v/ho undertook. to

250 THE REVERIE. 
furnilh out a magnificent feaft, if they would 
leave the whole to hiin. This great point be- 
ing thus happily fettled, they fettled their fto- 
machs alfo with a glafs of right coniac, and 
then retired to their refpeclive homes, to give 
their wives an account of thefe important 
tranfadtions. 
The fufs which was raifed among the fe- 
males upon this occafion, is not to be defcribed. 
All their finery was immediately drawn forth, 
and examined ; and then fuch confultati ons, 
and difputes with one goffip oi another; fuch a 
clatter with mantua-makers, and milleners, 
putting lappets to this, and flounces to that, 
altering and turning, to fet all things in order 
for making a proper appearance before my lord 
and my lady, that every houfe in the whole 
village was a fcene of litter and diftra6i:iorL, 
from that till the day of the feaft; many a poor 
tradefman facrifiting more than a year's profit 
of his bufinefs to his wife's vanity. Not that 
the hufbands entirely neglected to adorn them- 
felves either; but as their wives care was chief- 
ly about their tails, theirs was confined to their 
heads, upon which every one heaped a bundle 
of grey hairs, as an emblem of his wifdom and 
experience, more huge than ever grew upon 
the oldeft goat on Giledd-, he that peeped out of 
the larseil Heece thinkino; he cut the moil ref- 
pet5i:able figure. 
As for the feail, the ale- houfe man was not 
a moment at a lofs in providing it. He had 
formerly been fcullion in a gentleman's kitchin, 
io that he was not utterly unacquainted him- 
fcM with the nafty ways of tofnng up nice 
dillies : and now, with the help of an old

thing in the way that God made, or nature re- 
quired it for nouriihnient and health. 
Nor v.ere the decorations lefs ' elegant 
and grand than the feaft. As every trade in 
the parilli had a reprefentative in the fet, to 
whom the management of matters was com- 
mitted, it may be thought that they had a pro- 
per underflanding among themfelves, and did 
not ncglecSl any article, however unneceffary 
and even abfurd, which could poflibly be foift- 
ed in to fvvell their refpc(5live hills.

chaos was come again-. The ilreets, the lanes, 
the tops of the houfes were filled v»'ith gaping 
crouds, v/ho left their houfes, at the firfl dawn 
of the morning, to fecure the moft convenient 
places where they might fland fafting all day, 
to fee others go to a fc:ift, in the afternoon* 
Nor were the happy fev.', who were admitted 
to the envied honour of feeing them eat, more 
provident. The thought of fuch a fight took 
away their appetites ; and beficies, they could, 
not fpare a moment from the important work. 
of dreiiing, to take the leaft refrefhment. 
Tired of fuch complicated folly, I t a'iied to. 
his lordfhip's houfe, to fee in what light he, and 
his attendants, looked upon this grand affair. 
My former knowledge of his natural good fenfe 
made me judge that he was above being infe6!'- 
ed with fuch abfurdities. I v/as not deceived. 
He looked with pity upon the extravagance and. 
follv of his tenants, at the forne time that lie 
.received every teitimony of their attachment 
with pleafure. But his fervants were far 
enough from being fo cool. The pailion for 
feeing, and being feen, raged as violently in 
them as in the villagers themfelves, and pro- 
duced efFeds to the full as ridiculous. 
When it was time for his lordfnip to go to 
this grand feaft, he was fummoned by a pro- 
ceffion, from the village, v/ho came to wait 
unon him. The extravagancies fhev/n upon

and grin'd as fnvages ; in a word, every gurfe-, 
that folly could put on, without even attempt- 
ing to mimick rcafon, made up the motlev ca- 
valcade, and kept the croud agape. 
When they had cxpofed themfelves in this, 
manner through the whole village, theyufher- 
ed their gucfts into the place appointed tor thefr 
entertainment, where they were marfhalicd 
according to their different ranks. I went 
with the croud, and took my flation in the 
place from whence I could moft conveniently 
fee all that paflcd. 
The numbers of every age, fex, and rnnk, 
which I faw around me, preTented fuch a com- 
plicated fcenc, that nctwithftanding the extra- 
ordinary powers confered upon rne by my guide, 
my eyes were dazzled, my head grew giddy, 
and 1 was unable to view it with that dilHnct- 
ncfs which alone could give me pleafure. I 
hung down my head, difappointed and abaflied, 
and fvvclling with an hopelefs figh, "O that

" Jufl as thefe general reflexions are, they 
will be itill more convincing when confirmed 
by particular in{tances. Obferve that over-

he fafntly repelled their attempts, while the 
vanity of his heart gliilened through the thin

the inability of man's boailed leafon to refift

" It is hard to fay which of thefe pr.rties 
*' a(Sls on the moil irrational principles. The 
*' One, from a mean and abfurd motive of

*' lord, and the intcreft of the manor ; the

*' riiake an advantage of fupplying them with

*' equally fellifh, thougli difguifed under the

" In the fame manner do they differ about 
*' the conduit to be obferved with fome of

" their dirc6lors diveft themfelves of preju-

"not wantonly, or from a litigious difpofi- 
" tion, but to aiiert a legal right, and recover 
'^ loiTes unjuftly fufiercd, it would be both 
'-' didionourable and weak to drop it before 
" thofe ends are obtained ; and if in the courfe 
" of the conteft fome acquifitions have been 
" made, which were not originally even clnim- 
*' ed, the voice of reafoji directs to retain as 
" many of them ns fhall indemnify for the ex.-

" pence that no other people upon earth would 
*' be fuch fools as to undertake ; and flill are as 
"far from a conciufion as the momen-t we fet

'^ the lawyers and their party make iuch a noife

*' wife heads with notions of new demands, 
*' which our adverfary will never comply with;

" advantages. They receive their fees from

*' up to them, as an encouragement to be ho-

" the matter direclly. We muft take care of

*' having encouraged our adverfary to perfift, 
" not from any hope of getting the better of us 
"fairly, but of wearing out our rcfolution; 
" and if this is not dire6lly betraying his lord-

So home a charge put the compoumkr out of

foaming like a madman, for his pafiion had'

tearing open his waiftcoat, was going to de- 
mand i-nftant fatisfadion from his accufer. 
But a gentleman wno fat at the upper end of

Such reflections were too general, p^veiy 
mouth was inftantly opened to reply, when 
the fleward commanding lilence, with a tone 
and air of authority, '' I was in hopes, gen- 
" tiemen (faid he) that you would have thought 
*' proper to deliberate coolly on the matter I 
*' propofed to you j but, inftead of that, you 
'^ have fallen out among vourfelves, and tiwit

*' fitable as the one you have at prefent. I 
" defign to make you firll: clerk in my own

" fcruples ; and on the other hand, if it can- 
'* not be made up quite fo readily as you, Sir, 
" (addreffing himfelf to the grand compounder) 
** may wifh, there are ways of making up to 
*' you, not only what you may fuffer by the

** no occafion for beino; fo much alarmed at

*' fight with him, like a porter. Such wrang- 
*' ling is moft unbecoming gentlemen." 
This fpeech healed all animofities, and re- 
ilored the general harmony in a moment. 
The clerk bowed with a fmile of the moft 
chearful acquiefcence; and the grand compounder^ 
unable to conceal his joy, blubbered out, be- 
tween laughing and crying, " 1 am forry, Sir, 
*^ that I (hould mifbehave^ myfelf before you ;

'attachment to his lordfliip's honour and in- 
' tereft in many different inftances, in the 
' feveral capacities I have lerved him in. 
' When I v/as cockfivain of his barge, I 
' obliged his watermen to wear a particular 
' livery, at their own expence, and regulated 
' their rank ; and t'other day again, when I 
' was llev.-ard of the manor on the other lide 
' of the river, I drove away that fmuggkr and 
' his gang who put them all into fuch a pa- 
' nick^ by the great preparations which I 
' made to attack them ; and even in this very 
' affair of the law-fuit, I have been at greater 
' expence than any rnan in the whole manor 5 
^ and it is very hard if a man may not even 
' fpcak who parts with fo much money for 
' nothing. I am fure it has gone to my heart 
' many a time, when I have given away the 
' rent of a whole farm at once ! After all this, 
' I fay, it is too much to be accufed of be- 
' traying his intereft and honour. But, as I 
' can depend upon your word, I fhall think 
' no more of it.'* 
When the grand compounder had thus unbur- 
dened his heart, the iteward once more re- 
fumed the fubjciSb of their meeting. " As for 
" this law-fuit, gentlemen, (faid he) I own I 
*' am heartily tired of it, as I prefume every 
" man in his fenfes is ; and am determined to 
" make it up as foon as I can, that is, without 
" prejudice to his lordfhip's honour and the 
'* real intereft of the manor, which, however 
" fome people may pretend to diftinguifli be- 
' tween them, are efTentially one and the fame 
'' thing. But how to bring this about is the 
'* difficulty. The mob is intoxicated with 
2^4 T H E R E V E R I K. 
our fuccefles to fuch a degVce, that tlicy 
would be ready to drag any man through 
the kennel who fhould only mention flop- 
ping, though they do not even knov/ what 
they would be at, in going on. In thcfe cir- 
cumflances, I think it will be the beft way 
to let our adverfary privately know, that 
we arc not averfe to an accommodation ; 
and that if he will fend one of his people 
here with fuch a propofal, to give a colour 
to the affair, one of us will go to him, with 
full power to- fettle all matters in difpute 
between us. In the mean while we mull 
let the lawyers go on, at lead till the end of 
the term, to keep the mob in good humour ; 
and when the affair i« finifhed, we muft con- 
trive to throw fome new bubble or other up 
in the air, for them to gaze at, whpch may 
divert their attention from every thing elfe. 
This, gentlemen, is my opinion: I only am 
at a lofs for a proper perfon to fend. If 
mufl be one of fome confcqucnce, to give 
weight to what he fays, and who does not' 
regard the abufe and infults of the mob, of 
which he will probably be the chief objedl, 
in the firff fallies of their refentment, before 
there can be any thing done to appeafe them." 
" I am the man ! (faid the grand compounder^ 
flarting up in a tranfport) I am the man ! 
I have given proof, that I defy the refent- 
ment of the moft defperate mob ; and no- 
perfon's word will have more weight with 
our adverfary than mine. I am intimately 
acquainted with moft of his principal fer- 
vants, with whom I have all along kept up 
a friendly interccurfc ; vrhich has made him 
"think.
