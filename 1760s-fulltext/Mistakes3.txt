^ TX THO would not laugh at the rldl- 
V V culous cafualties proceeding from 
love, gallantry, and the whole train of. 
-paffions ? They are fuch, Frederick, that 
a man of fenfe, m his fober Jiours, can- 
Hot have theleaft idea of them. 
We know not the twentieth part of the 
follies we may fucceffively be entertained 
'^or vexed with.— What a diverfity ! — how 
extenfive the circle in which they are con- 
tained !-^One whim produces a thouiand. 
—None but a Newton in morals could a- 
fcribe to our thoughts their juft limits, and 
difcovcr their flow, ebb and attraction.

They come feparate, or in crouds, to haftcn 
or retard the tide of defire : — fubjeft to no 
rule, impatient of command, they daring- 
ly intrude, and as confidently fwajr. 
Surely, Frederick, the organs of a rati- 
onal being have no conformity with thoffe 
of a fenfelefs fage who will tell us in a lofty 
difCourfe, we muft, on his word, believe 
Nature the Qave of theWill, though flie fu- 
premely difpofes of our fcnfcs.— Is not 
the fubjefling the creator to the created a 
mighty judicious proof of our power of 
af^uig and thinking? How firange and 
inconfiftent fuch language 1 ■ how ftill 
more impertinent our credulity ! 
Could I lord it over my thoughts, 
would I not immediately remove the in- 
tolerable fcruple which preys upon my 
nfiind ? 
Sir John with fo unaffeAed a gaiety, fo 
natural an indifTerence^ as if his heart was 
abfolutely free. 
I have no ears for Frofby— no tongue 
for Mrs, Brenton no patience for Sit 
Joha I am diijpleafed at them all. 
I have juft told Sophy I am not well, 
and choofe to be alone. ——I don't like 
the looks of Sophy —they betray a fuf- 
plcion —dart a defire to fearch into my 
heart — follow my fkps — watch my mo- 
tions. — She had the indifcretion this morn- 
ing, to venture a fear I was not happy, as I 
had, laft night, breathed many a figh— 
fpoke broken words. — — Now has (he a-

Never was I better. Madam;? 
Why then daft thou defire to be alone ?- 
-—Seldom is folitude a friend, Vild we mutually

Wouldft thou liften to thy generoiity,.

I know that Fro(by*s mifery (hall be agony

—Oh, Viaorial— 
I will endeavour to command my fenti-

rthey are all errant rogues ! When love in- 
iblently filences reafon, is it not next to a

I am vexed to tlie foul, Vi^ria, when 
I think that the power of our pretty faces 
IhallJhiardly outlive the firft tranfports of a

I was about fixtecn, when a Chinefc 
Cold Pheafant, the firft I had ever fecn, 
was prefcnted me. As tame in reality, as 
a new admirer in appearance, it be- 
came my fole delight. So fond was I of 
the 
i^greeably lodged.— Heigh ho ! how long 
flull I refufe his vifits ? He exafperatj?d 
me fo, when laft I faw him, that he has 
had no opportunity iinee to fay he repents , 
— to hear I forgive. — He has written, he 
has looked, he has fighed — no anfwer, no 
look, no figh has been returned. — Were 
I certain he never would difpleafe, quickly 
would I love again; but what hopes, if 
jealoufy Is part of his life ? Shall a weak 
woman be more powerful than nature ! 
Though beauty might lull a few fy mptoms 
afleep, the diforder would ftlU fubfift. — 
Jealoufy I what a poifon art thou, that no 
antidote can be found againft thee I

"was a man of his rank left enamoiu'ed of vir- 
tue, andmorelaviih of its facred language. 
That tyranny which he now ex- 
erts over men of genius, he once exert- 
ed over his amiable lady* In the in- 
fency of their marriage, he prefumed that, 
in his hands, ihe ihould, like wax, be mo- 
dified to his £cincy I he would have had her 
perpetually fympathize with his follies, 
never fluctuate between his inclination and 
her own judgment. He furhiihed her li-

had carefully brought up in the reafanakk

her at the fidi deviation from her con- 
jugal duty, and hourly tutored on the 
facred prerogative of her lord, for a long 
while fmothered her complaints, and con- 
cealed her tears* 
So long as Ihe faw the devils, and trem- 
bled in the dark, Ihe remained paffively o-

Sir Henry loved his lifter too tenderly 
not to perceive (he was unhappy, and at- 
tempt to procure her a life more fuitable to 
her age, rank and fortune* 
The diflicufty was incredible, the 
fuccefs doubtful. He had to combat 
bigotry, ever raoft obftlnate in the practice 
of fuperficial duties, when religion orders 
them not, and the ferocity of a man born 
with an innate hatred to benevolence. 
For two months Lady Ravenfor conti* 
nued deaf to his felicitations. Her love 
for him, not reafon, at length con- 
vinced her that the folitude in which 
her daughter was buried, was not only an

We had hardly paid our compliments to 
the ladies when his Lordlhip entered the 
room. 
You have made great hafte, my Lord : 
you furely thought I was dying, no other 
concern could have prevented your jour- 
ney to Penrith. Well, be comforted—  
the fall was not dangerous : I never was 
better in my life. ^

What generofity 1— and I could offend I

How he delighted 'my ear, Frederick t! 
You loved me not*— I have not that re- 
morfe to torture me,r — ^What a triumph y my performance ?■ ■ 
^ am, Sir: but as you are fo averfe 
to afford us that plcafurc I will en- 
treat you no longer. Be aflured, my 
trady, that Mr. Fro'fby^has a very flight 
knowledge of Mifs Cranmer — — that he 
imitates not the bcaus of the age in their 
tranfitory amours— that his heart ic 
wholly youn.— — -Is it probable that a 
. man of his undcrftariding would have 
fo fooliihly talked himfelf into difgrace t 
from his carelefliidfs you may infer he is 
innocent. Were he a man of faihionablc 
life, indeed he might love, change, and! 
boaft of it: but he is not a Duke or a Sir 
Jfdhn Modilh, — That 'frown is unfea-^ 
Ibnable, Sir, you would be difpleafed not 
to defcrvc thitf euloglum.— ^ 
Your farcafms are too fprlghtly, Mifi, 
not to be forgiven. But if I admire your 
ToL.IIL L wit, 
[ 2I« 3 
wit, I am forry I cannot pay the {ame 
compliment to your fincerity. 
Perhaps Sir John has feith in thofe 
thin^ only his fclf-loye is interefted t9 
bclieye»— Had you lefs partiality, Sir^ 
you would think me more credible. >- 
And {he fpoke with fuch an ar at inge- 
liuity aniindiiference about Cranmer and 
frofby, that hadl sot been convinced of 
thcur amour, I fhould hare been a dupe to 
her apparent candour. 
The impodure was fo artfully fupported 
by her hatural elocution that I caught iii 
the looks of Mrs. Brenton a ^efire to cre- 
dit her, blended with a temptation not t9 
mifirufimy word. 
We 
C"9] 
We muft own, faid Lady Viftoria fmil- 
ing, that Mr. Frofby could not have a 
more fkilful apologift for the flights of his 
good nature: but I really doubt, Mifs, 
whether he will thank you for the at- 
tempt. Too genuine were his forrow 
and repentance, too decifive the words he 
uttered, too unaflfected the tears he Ihed. 
'Twas no farce, Mifs ; Art, however in- 
genious, has not the flexibility of Nature. 
May not Mr. Frofby have fecrets un^- 
known to you ? — 
He may have hundreds for aught I 
know, but this could be no fecret, Mifi 
Cranmer's friendihip for me^ and Mr. 
Frolby's public homage to you^ prQve 
unanfwerably the impoffibillty of. an la« 
tngifc; between themj and of it beUig

Are you not aftonilhed, Frederick, at 
the unfhaken confidence of Mifs Eillfon^ 
and the dexterity with which. Ihe inter-, 
preted the behaviour of Frofby ? At what 
political fchool has ihe attained fo un? 
fpeakabJe a maftery over herfelf ? 
How naturally (he ihewcd a diflikc ta 
me, to give my oppofition an air of re^ 
venge! how daringly Ihe provoked my 
anger, and defended Frolby ! 
. This is a loiew plot, faid I to myfelf, 
jufll^id fo iciv^Iidate the imprudent decfen 
ntjods^ di Frbiby i and fo f^r has it al-

or could he, with a native hy pocrify , a£l

difficult to conviift them. Thanks to

mind. Lady Vi
