containing fourteen thoufand fa-

trade in wine, filk, and gilt leather. 
The country about it is delight- 
ful, being watered by the Guadal- 
quivir. There groves of citrons, 
oranges and pomegranates perfume 
the air, and every thing invites to 
the fofter pleafures. 
The beauty of the palaces, and 
the magnificence of the grand Mof- 
quita, ftruck us with admiration. 
As we were at tabic, and defigned 
after dinner to take a vievir of this 
noble Jftrudture, Coeurleon faid to

Moors. 
The Moors, anfwered Melefinda, 
feem to have been an extraordinary 
people, and to have excelled other na- 
tions of their time in arts and fciences. 
As there are fo many things in 
Spain, that relate to them, I fhould 
take it as a favour, if you would 
write me at your leifure a (hort 
account of them. I have it ready 
done to your hand, replied the 
baron Swenitz (for we had given 
him that title fince our being in 
Spain.) With that he took out of 
a little fhagreen cafe the following 
extracts or memorandums. 
The Goths, a northern people, 
who had made themfclves mafters

fhut forages, until king Rodriguc2 
ordered it to be opened ; upon 
which there were heard terribk 
noifes and a violent tetnpefl: enfued, 
as if the elements were going into

by the light of torches he faw the 
figures of divers men, whofe garb

held a copper blade in his hand^ 
und upon it was written in Arabic, 
that the time drew near for the 
defolation of Spain, and that the 
perfons, whofe ftatues were there, 
would ere long come. 
Soon after this, Rodriguez having 
ravifhed Florinda, daughter of 
count Julian, that lord, forgetting 
what he owed his country, called 
in the Moors to affift him in aveng- 
ing the honour of his family. 
In 714 the Moors gained the 
famous battle, in which Rodriguez 
loft his life. Spain was fuhdued, 
and the kingdom of the Goths ex-* 
tindt, except in the mountains of

the moft refolute of the Goths, and 
after a fignal viitory gained over a 
very numerous army in 7 1 9, among 
the mountains of Santa Mavia di 
Cavadonga, oppofed to the Moors 
a new kingdom, by which they 
were one day to be driven out of 
Spain. 
After the death of the Moorifh 
king Abdorames, the emirs of the 
Spanifli provinces afpired to in-^ 
dependency. 
Alphonfo the Chafte, of the race 
of king Peladio, after having gained 
fome glorious victories over the 
Moors, found himfelf in quiet pof- 
fcffion of the Afturias and Leon, at 
the beginning of the ninth century. 
The

The fuccefs of this prince, notwith- 
{landing the obflaclcs he had to cn^ 
counter, emboldened the chriftians 
of Navarre to cledt themfelves a 
king. 
The inhabitants- of Arragon took 
up arms under one of their counts; 
the reft of Spain ftill continued 
under the dominion of the Moorifli 
kings, who had fixed their feat 
here at Cordova, where Abdorames, 
who reigned over all the Moors 
in the year 787, built this grand 
Mofquita, 
Here the arts flouriflied, and the 
court of the Mooriih kings was the 
centre of gallantry, magnificence, 
and the choiceft pleafures. Tour- 
naments and tiliings probably owed 
their

their invention to the Moors. They 
had alfo (hews and theatres. Her* 
^ alfo geometry, aftronomy, chc* 
miftry and phyfick were cultivated* 
In 1039, Ferdinand the iirft>» 
king of Caftile and Leon, rendered 
his reign illuftrious by an infinity of 
noble exploits. Taking advantage 
of the ill condu6t of the Moors, 
who by forming feveral little king-^ 
doms had ruined that of Cordova^ 
the principal feat of their greatnefs 
in Spain, he compelled their kings 
to purchafc peace, and to pay him 
a large fum of gold for tribute. 
The year 1236 fcemed a period 
marked out for the glory of Spain, 
and the expulfion of the Moors. 
. Ferdinand the third, king of Caftile 
and 
Chevalier Piekpoint, 13 
lind Leon, took Cordova from them. 
He fubdued alfo the Moors of the 
province of Murcia. This country^ 
though of fmall extent, is extremely 
fertile, and the Moors ufed to get 
a great quantity of filk there, which 
they manufactured into curious 
ftuffs. 
This Ferdinand, after a fiege of 
fixteen months, conquered likewife 
Seville, the moft opulent city the 
Moors had in their pofleflion. He 
enadled wholefome and wife laws, 
eredled feveral new courts of judi- 
cature, and inflituted the royal 
council of Caftile, which has fub- 
fifted ever fince his time« 
However the Moors were not 
entirely fubdued until the year 
14 Memoirs of the 
1491, when the city of Granada 
was taken by Ferdinand king of 
Caflile, and Ifabella queen of Ar- 
ragon, who had united all the petty 
kingdoms of Spain into one, by 
their marriage. 
Boabdilla, king of Granada, 
came out of the town, and went to 
prefent the keys to Ferdinand and 
queen Ifabella, who treated him 
with all the honours due to a king. 
He withdrew into Africa, where 
be died. 
Granada was full of riches, and 
adorned with a number of fplendid 
palaces, efpecially that ftupendous 
one of the Moorifh kings, in which 
were the fineft baths in Europe, 
and a number of magnificent and 
fpacious 
Chevalier Pierpoint. 15 
ipacious apartments fupported by 
an hundred pillars of alabafter. 
King Ferdinand and queen 
IfabcUa gave the Moors their op- 
tion, either to turn chriftians, or 
quit the kingdom. Fifty thoufand 
of them became chriftians, others 
retired into Africa, and had this 
comfort at leaft in their expulfion, 
that their retreat was into the 
country of their anceftors, one of 
the moft delightful parts of the 
world. 
The Jews were baniftied about 
the fame time. This people, by 
vile pradlices and exorbitant ufury, 
had accumulated to themfclves all 
the riches of the kingdom. There 
were no lefs than an hundred and 
fifty

fifty thoufand of this foreign mtioi 
among the Spaniards. 
It was therefore debated in th< 
king's and queen's council^ by whai 
means Spain might be deliverec 
from this underhand tyranny of the 
Jews, after having fhaken o£F thai 
of the Moors. 
At length they came to n re- 
folution, in the year 1492, to drive 
them all out of the kingdom, and 
fpoil them of fome part at Icaft ol 
their ill-gotten riches. Some oi 
this people retired into Africa, 
others into Portugal and France, 
but many returned to Spain, and 
became chriftians. 
The countefs thanked the phi- 
lofopher for this account of Spain

Chevalier Pierpoint. 17 
and the Moors, and begged a copy 
of it, which he promifed her. 
Then Coeurleon took the word, and 
faid, that he was not without hopes 
of meeting at Cordova a good friend 
of his, named Don de los Torres^ 
a knight of Calatravai hiftorio^ 
grapher, and profeflbr of natural

While we were unweariedly ad^ 
miring the beauties of the ftrudture 
and the finencfs of this painting, 
we faw a man walking with a grave 
and flow pace towards us, who 
feemed buried in fonie profound 
thought. He was drejft in a long 
robe of white filk ; on his flioulder 
were four flower de luces crofs-wife, 
wrought with crimfon fiik on a 
gold ground ; by which habit and 
badge'ive knew him to be of the 
order of the knights of Calatrava. 
He was already come near us with- 
out having perceived us, when 
Cceurleojn, whofe fight had been 
engaged elfewhere, looking upon 
him, knew his friend Don de los 
Torres. The old knight embraced 
CoeurleoB 
Chevalier Pierpoint. 21 
Coeurleon with afFcdlion, and being 
informed by hini, who we were, 
cxprefled great joy at feeing us. 
After the ufual congratulations, and 
a (hort converfation, he went along 
with us to fhew us the cathedral. 
It would be tedious to fet down all 
the ornaments there. I (hall there- 
fore content myfclf with mention- 
ing only two fine piftures done by 
two great mafters. The one rc- 
prefented Cardinal Ximenes preach- 
ing to the Moors of Granada j 
the other, an angel prefenting a 
golden fleece to a peafant. There, 
faid the knight of Calatrava, (point- 
ing to Ximenes) is the pidure of an 
extraordinary man. He did not 
enter into the world till he was 
B 3 fixty 
22 McMOHis of the 
iixty years old,, and depended upon 
iiniflikig his life in folitude, when 
he was taken from thence and 
placed at the helm of the king- 
dom by Ifabella the queen of Spain. 
His miniftry was glorious for his 
difintereftednefs, and magnanimity. 
He converted *he Moors in great 
numbers: he conquered Oran him- 
felf in perfon. He protedted and 
encouraged learning; and founded 
the univcrfity of Alcala de Hen- 
nara: At laft having loft all autho- 
rity* by means of thofe who had 
prejudiced king Charles agairift 
hipif l>c retreated again to his 
folitude, and died without regret- 
ting his former high ftation and 
honours. 
This

This fine piece, fair countefs, 
continued the knight, was done by 
Tintoretto in a vifit he made to 
Spain. Tintoretto was early emi- 
nent for painting and mufic. 
But painting being what he took 
moft delight in, he refolved to 
apply bimfelf wholly to it. 
You may difcern in this pi<3;ure, 
Michael Angelo's gufto of defign- 
ingt and Titian's way of colouring, 
for theie two painters were his 
guides. Through the vivacity of 
his imagination he was fometimes 
incorredt: his attitudes are often 
contrafted to excefs, and ibmetimes 
extravagant, thofe of his women ' 
excepted, who& attitudes he always 
painted graceful.

very vigorous, his work eafy, and 
his touches lively. His heads are 
defigned with a grand gufto; his. 
local colours arc good, and his car- 
nations come up very near to Ti- 
tian's. The emperor Charles the 
the fifth gave him five thoufand 
ducats of gold for this piece: 
which fum Tintoretto gave in 
marriage with his daughter Maria 
Tintoretto. She had been taught 
to paint by her father, and drew 
a great number of portraits both of 
men and women. She delighted in 
mufic, and played well on feveral 
inftrumehts. Her father loved her 
fo tenderly that he would not let 
her leave him, even after flie was 
married 5

fortune to lofe her in the thirtieth

THIS other ^pidlure fliews 
you the origin of the order 
of the golden fleece. 
At the time when the Moors 
poflefled the lineft and greateft part 
of Spain, a pfeafant praying one day 
very fervently that the kingdom 
might be delivered from them, 
an angel came to him, and giving 
him a fleece of gold, ordered him 
to make ufe of it to aflfemble an 
army, becaufe none would refufe to 
follow it. The, peafant obeyed 
and the fuccefs anfwered the hop 
conceived of the rich prefent. I 
memo 
Chevalier Pierpoint. vj 
memory of this, was inftituted the 
order of the golden fleece. 
This fine painting, in which fo 
much grace is feen, was performed 
by Guido Reni. I have a pifture 
done in imitation of his manner, 
faid Mdefinda, and have heard him 
much commended. I (hall take it 
as a favour, if you will be fo ob« 
liging, as to give fome account 
of him. With great pleafure, re- 
plied the old knight. 
Guide Reni was born at Bo- 
logna, in the year 1 574 ; the fon 
of Daniel Reni, an excellent mufi- 
cian. He learnt the rudiments of 
painting under Denis Calvert, a 
Flemifli mafter, who had then a 
good reputation : but the academy 
of 
28 Memoirs of the 
of the Carracci at Bologna begianing 
to be talked of, Guido left his 
mafter, and entered himfelf in that 
fchool. In his firft pieces he fol- 
lowed entirely the manner of his 
new mafters, and chiefly imitated 
Lodovico, becaufe he found more 
grace and grandeur in his com- 
politions than in thofe of his kinf- 
men. He afterwards endeavoured 
to find out a manner on which he 
might fix. He went to Rome, 
and copied all forts of things there. 
He was charmed with Raphael's 
pidures, and pleafed with the fpirit 
of Caravaggio's. He tried every 
ftile, and at laft hit upon one, 
againft which nobody had any thing 
to fay. Indeed, it was great, ealy, 
SracefuU

graceful, and got him vaft riches, 
and an equal reputation. Michael 
Angelo da Caravaggio, being angry 
that he had fuddenly changed his 
manner, which was ftrojig and 
brown, for one quite oppofite to 
it, fpoke very contemptibly of his 
pidlures ; and his infolent expref- 
lions might have had ill con- 
fequences, had not Guido prudently 
avoided difputing with a man of 
his impetuous temper, * 
Guido returning to Bolcgna, 
grew famous for the care he took 
in finifhing his pieces : and per- 
ceiving that people of high rank 
were eager to have them, he fet a 
price upon them, according to the 
number of figures in each pidlure, 
and 
30 Memoirs of the 
and every pidure he valued at one 
hundred Roman crowns. 
By thefe high prices, Guidq 
found himfelf in a little time very 
rich, and lived magnificently, till 
an immoderate love of gaming 
feized him. He was unfortunate, 
and his lofles reduced him to necef- 
lities he could not go through;. 
His friends ufed all imaginable ar- 
guments to diiTuade him from play, 
))ut he would not give it of er. He 
fcnt his pidures to be fold under- 
hand at a low rate, and took it for 
fiich as he had before refufed large 
fums for. As foon as he had got 
the few pieces of gold he had for 
them in his pocket, he immediately 
w^nt to look out for his gamcfters 
3 
Chevalier Pibr point. 3* 
to have his revenge. At laft, as one 
pafHon weakens another^ his love, 
of gaming leflened his love of paint- 
ing fo far, that he never thought of 
his reputation in what he did, but 
only to expedite his paintings, and 
get ibme pifloles for fubfiilence. 
Except his vice of gaming, he was 
a man of good morals; and could 
he have correfted that fault, would 
have been m accompliflied perlbn*. 
Ifle died at Bologna, in 1640, ia 
the fixty-feventh year of his age- 
As to his paintings, it muil be 
owned his talent was not equally 
proper to treat of all forts of fub- 
Such as were devout and

grandeur, noblenefs, fwectnefs, and

grace, were the characSter of his 
mind. He has fpread them fo 
much over all his works, as in the 
piece before us, that they are the 
principal marks which diftinguifh 
him from other painters. 
His thoughts , are delicate, and 
the difpofition of his objects in 
general, and of his figures in par- 
tictilar, is good. 
His heads yield no manner of 
precedence to thofe of Raphael^ 
either for cor^edtnefs of dcfign, or 
delicacy of expreflion, cfpecially the 
upper part of them ; though he did 
not commonly treat of fubjedts that 
were capable of furnifhing him with 
fo great variety of expreffions, as 
are in Raphael's. 
His 
Chevalier Pierpoint. 33 
His merit confiftcd in that moving 
beauty, which, in my opinion, did 
not proceed fo much from a re- 
gularity of features, as from a 
lovely air which he gave the mouth, 
that had fomething in it between a 
fmile and ferioufnefs, and in the 
graces of the mouth, with a certain 
modefly, which he put in the eyes. 
In ftiort, in whatever manner or 
dme he painted his pictures, his 
thoughts are fo delicate, his figutes 
b noble, his expreflions fo fweet, 
lis dreffes fo rich, and every thing 
o graceful, that he was, and ever 
ivill be univerfally admired.

The Hiftory of the 
Countess ORIANA. 
NOT long fincc on the banks 
of this river dwelt a young 
lady, named Oriana, who had been

whom he greatly cqnfided, being 
prejudiced in his favour as he

He gave likewife to^ this friend,

Corvellonc took the charge, and 
at firft behaved with great kindnefs 
to Oriana. But this ftiew of af- 
fedlion did not laft long. 
It happened that; a young gran- 
dee, Don Valafconte, a knight of 
the golden fleece, faw Oriana, and 
was ftruck with her beauty. This 
nobleman was about the age of 
nineteen or twenty years. He was 
naturally good-natured, and by the 
gracefulnefs of his perfon, a win- 
iwng converfation, fprightlinefs of 
humour, and ^ peculiar charm 
which animated his whole deport- 
ment, gained the hearts of all. He 
was one of thofe perfonages, whom 
nature feems to have formed in the , 
height of good humour, and who, 
as

as foon as they appear, unite the 
moft oppofite chara<fters in their

advantageous impreffions. But with 
all thefe accompliihments, he had 
given himfelf up to his pleafures ; 
and to fum up his charadter, he was 
a compound of whatever is moft 
agreeable and irregular. 
This young nobleman thought 
himfelf of too high rank and 
quality to propofe to marry Oriaha; 
and being well acquainted with 
Corvellone, and knowing that he 
was of fuch a miferable difpbfition, 
that a good fum of gold would 
tempt him to any thing, he went 
and opened his intentions to him. 
He told him that he was pafiionately 
iiv 
42 M £ M IRS of the 
in love with Oriana, and that if 
he woujLd perfuade her to be his 
miftrefs., he would prefent him with 
two thoufand ducats of gold. 
Conrellone being charmed with 
the offer of fuch a furn, though 
himfelf was extremely rich, and 
intending befides to fecure to him- 
felf the young Oriana's fortune, 
which her father had left her, ua- 
4crtook the affair out of hand. 
He fent for Oriana into his clolet, 
^iid faid to her. Fair Oriana, I have 
;an affair of great importance to 
communicate to you. Don Valai^- 
fConte, a knight of the goldea 
^eece, whom you have feen^ and 
who is fo remarkable for his noble 
and magnifiGent way of livings is 
become 
Chevalier Pierpoint. 43 
become paffionately in love with 
you. I have confented to let him 
come to vifit you. You muft drefs 
yourfclfin your fineft apparel and 
do all you can to pleafe him. UCc 
every ^rt to fix his afFcdtions. His 
rank indeed does not permit him 
publickly to make you his wife. 
But he propofes that you fliall live 
in one of his caftles in the country, 
as his miftrefs, and under that name 
to make your fortune. He added 
much more to the fame purpofe: 
He reprefented to her the condee's 
riches, his fine houfes, parks, and 
gardens, which (he was to have 
perfe<fl command of, and omitted 
pothing that might footh a. woman's 
patural love of pleafure, her vanity 
44 Memoirs of the 
or ambition : and concluded with 
reprefenting to her that (he had 
but a imall fortune left her ; that 
himfelf was by no means fo rich as 
was imagined, and could do little 
for her; and that having loft her 
parents, and being deftitute of 
friends, (he ought not to hefitate a 
. moment about accepting fo advan- 
tageous an offer. 
Oriana was in the greateft con- 
ftemation and furprife at this dif- 
courfe, as- you may well imagine. 
Her looks fhewed her fecret emo- 
tions, and her frequent blufhes tef- 
tified how much flie abhorred the 
propofal. She rcprefented to Cor- 
vellone, what a ftain it would be 
to his honour and her own. Let 
th^ 
Chevalier Pierpoint. 45 
liie comlee, faid {he, enjoy his 
riches^ and me my innocence. She * 
ufed tears and entreaties to move 
him, but to no purpofe. His heart 
was hardened; neither tears, nor 
entreaties, nor force of reafon, no* 
youthful charms of beauty afHidlcd, 
could afiedt him, or make him in 
the leaft alter his refolutions. On 
the contrary he was roufed to wrath 
that reddened and flufhed in his 
afpeA, and he threatened to aban* 
tloil her to the world, if fiie did 
not obey him. 
Oriana retired to her apartment, 
filled with grief and anxiety. There 
flie befought heaven to inftruit her 
how to behave. Soon /he felt her- 
felf infpireci wiih wonderful refo- 
ution> 
i 
46 MEMoiRSbf the 
lution, and prefently came to a de- 
termination. She put on her ridiefl 
attire, and adorned herfelf with the 
few jewels flie had: though her 
beauty alone without ornament was 
capable of touching any heart but 
her guardian's with tendereft love. 
In the evening Valafconte came 2 
Corvellone conducted him to thd 
door of Oriana's apartment^ where 
he left him. 
As foon as the condee appeafed^ 
Oriana rofe up to receive him. He 
made her a profound obeyfanc^, and 
they took their feats. Oriana then 
demanded what might be the oc- 
cafioh of the honour he was pleafcd 
to do her in a vifit ? Love, an- 
fwered he, looking tenderly upon 
her. 
Chevalier P i k R r o i n t. 47

Ac greateft prince might envy mf

iinuating, faid much more in the 
fame ftraih : to all which OrianOr 
no doubt ftrengthened by heaven,- 
anfwered without blw(hcs or any 
ieemiog emotion, bot with polite- 
ne& znd complaitance. 
In the mean time a collation 
was ferved up, which he himfelf 
had ordered. He helped Oriana to 
every thing himfelf, and filled out 
wine to her in a cup of fine agate 
rimmed with gold. The more he 
Idoked upon her, the mor^ beau- 
2 tjfai 
48 M E M o I R s of the 
(iful he thought her. He talked 
very gallantly to her; and flie, 
whofe wit was equal to her beauty, 
replied with fo much fenfe, (pright- 
linefs, and innocent ingenuity, that 
flie charmed him with her conver- 
fation. At length towards the end 
of the regale, he threw himfelf 
at her feet, and preffing her hand, 
Faireft Oriana, faid he to her, if 
your eyes at firft have wounded me, 
your difcourfe has finifhed the con- 
queft of my heart. The paflion 
you have kindled in my breaft will 
burn for ever ; from this time for-

VALASCONTE carried her 
that evening to the royal 
jibbey of Gacnza, where he ordered 
every thing for her, that could con- 
tribute to render her fituation agree- 
able. At length, love got the better 
of all odier confiderations, and he 
refolved to marry her, if flie v^rould 
give hini her hand, you may ea-? 
^ily imagine fhe fhewed no averfion 
to his offer : ^nd they were married 
jn private. 
After the cerenaony was over, he 
made it publiC and celebrated hi? 
jnarriage with pomp and magni- 
fjcence. He introduced Oriana to 
' * ' pourt, 
Chevalier Pier point. 57 
icourt, where her beauty and ac- 
complishments engaged the admi- 
ration and afFedlions of all who had 
^ny fentinxent. Her ftory was 
made known to the fovereign, who 
ordered Corvellone's riches to be  
diftributed among his relations, and 
himfelf fent to dig in the gold 
mines of Mexico, 
As for Valafconte, his happinefs 
increafed daily : the more he was 
acquainted with the mind and heart 
of Oriana, the more he was charmed 
with her. Her converfation polilhed 
the manners of her hufband, who 
infenfibly acquired by it a delicacy 
of fentiment, with which till then 
he had been unacqHainted. ' In a 
Viovd, through her he became il- 
liiftrious 
58 Memoirs of the 
luftrious for his virtue. Oriana died, 
though in the flower of her age, 
after having brought him two fons 
and two daughters. The condee 
did not long furvive her, and their 
a(hes were united in the fame 
tomb. 
We were by this time arrived at 
the park, which reached down to 
the banks of the river. There we 
landed, and went up a gentle afcent; 
at length we entered into a plea£int 
w3dernefs, where in a mount, 
planted with divers forts of trees, 
intermixt with fragrant fhrubs, a 
chapel was contrived in &>rm of a 
grotto, to which the light came 
down through opemngs ia the rock, 
cowed

cov^d over with fine iron work 
and cryfta]. 
In this chapel was a tomb of red 
granite curioufly adorned. In a rich 
cabinet^ covered with a vail of 
erimibn^ drawn by cords of mohair 
and filver,, was the figure of Oriana 
in oriental alabafter. She feemed: 
in a pleafing &tcp ihe had a coronet 
©n her head,: and her form was^ 
rprinkllbd with artificial flowers. 
Over her was this infcription in

There are few hiftorians free

of great importance. It points out 
great

great examples to us. It makes 
the vices of bad men ferve for in- 
ftrudtion to the good. It dilcn- 
tangles the origin of nations; and 
fhews by what means people pafled 
from one form of government to 
another. 
A good hiftorian is not partial 
to any age, or nation. Though he 
loves his country, he never flatters 
it. A Spanifh hiftorian ftiould 
fhew himfclf neutral between Eng- 
land and Spain. He ought to praifc 
the earl of Peterborough, as freely 
as Don Manuel de Leon, the

He equally avoids panegyric and

than he confines himfelf to relate

without jPattery or malice. Our

ends to ohlcure it. 
The fame pains and licence that 
irthcrs take to detract from illwf- 
trious names, I would willingly 
take to raife them hig^. 
As for thofe rare perfonages, who 
are culled out by the confent of wife 
men, for an example to the world, 
I ihould honour them by all the cir- 
cumftances I could invent of a fa- 
vourable conftrudtion. And we arc 
to believe that the force of our

and there would be no indecency in 
the cafe, fhould our zeal a little 
tranfport us in favour of fuch facred 
perfonages. What fome people 
do to the contrary, they either do, 
it for lucre of gold, or out of malice, 
or through vicioufnefe of confining 
their belief to their own capacity, 
or by reafon that their fight is not 
ftrong, clear and elevated enough 
to conceive the fplendour of virtue 
in her native purity. Hence anions 
of the greateft fortitude and fandUty 
have been imputed to ambition or 
vain-glory : whereas the fartie per- 
fons would have performed, and 
adtually did perform the fame, 
when they had ignominy and 
difgrace 
Chevalier Pier point. 73 
di(grace inftead of riches or gloiy 
for reward. 
In the next place I would not 
have an hiftorian too inclined to 
fuperflition. But it is prefumption 
to flight and condemn every thing 
as falfe, becaufe it does not feem to 
us likely to be true, which is the 
common failing of fuch as fancy 
themfelves wifer than their neigh- 
bours. I was myfclf formerly of 
that caft ; and if I heard of fpirits 
walking, dreams, prognoftications 
of futurity, inchantments, witch- 
craft, or any other thing, that I 
knew not what to make of, I pitied 
the people who were impofed upon 
by fuch things ; and now I find 
that

Experience has taught mc to fu-

reafon and religion have inftrudted

and impoffible, becaufe beyond my

A moft neceflary an d moft un-

and the fucceflive manners of the 
nation u^hofe hiftory he writes. 
A painter who does not know what 
the Italians call // Cojlume^. can 
draw nothing exadly. The paint- 
ers of the fchool of Lombardy 
have failed in this particular, though 
in other rcfpedts, they have repre- 
fented nature to the life. They 
have drawn the high prieft of 
Jcrufaleni, like the pontifof Rome; 
and the antient Greeks like the 
pcopl;i

laugh at an hiftorian who fhould 
ipeak of the magnificence of Doa 
Pelladio's court in the Afturian 
mountains, or of the immehfe 
riches of his wealtheift fubjed^s. 
Again — 
There is nothing more agreeable 
in hiftory than an ealy, noble con- 
cifenefs. 
An hiftorian ought to retrench 
many fuperfluous epithets, and 
other fuch ornaments. This will- 
make his hiftory more concifc» 
more lively, more fimple, and more 
agreeable. In his narration he 
ought to interweave the moft folid 
notions of virtue, without mora- 
lizing. He ihould aVoid fententious

There prevails an aiFedled j)olite- 
nefs among the pedantic and con« 
ceited part of all ranks and pro- 
fcffions, who value themfelves upoiv 
their wit or learning. They never 
venture to ufe any expreffion but 
what they reckon fine and uncom- 
mon. They talk always in an high 
'ftrain, and would think it beneath 
them to call things by their proper 
Barnes. Now in true .eloquence 
aknoft every thing may be intro- 
duced. The perfedlion of poetry 
itfelf, which is the loftieft kind of 
compodtion,. 
8o Memoirs of the 
compofition, depends on a full and 
lively defcription of things in all 
their circumftanccs. Fafts related 
without circumftances are like a 
tree ftript of its leaves ; they make 
' only the dry trunk and leafleis 
branches of an hiftory. 
Not that in relating fafts we 
ought to defcribe every individual 
circumftance that belongs to them. 
Some will not omit even the moft 
dry, ufelefs and impertinent ones : 
as whether Montefinos took out 
the heart of his friend Durandarte, 
the momeht he expired, in order to 
carry it to his miftrefs Belerma^ 
with the point of a dagger, or with 
a fmall piece of damafked ileel as 
fharp as an awl. An hiftorian of

this charadter follows his own hu- 
mour without regarding the public

as fond as he is of thofe trifles that 
employ his infatiablc curiofity. 
On the contrary, a pmdcnt hi- 
ftorian drops all infigniflcant fadts, 
that give the reader no light into 
any important point. So that it 
requires great judgment to make a 
right choice of circumdances. But 
at the fame time, we muft not be 
afraid of mentioning fuch circum- 
ftances as can be any way fervice- 
able. For it is a falfe delicacy that

One of her fuitors was the gal-

not make any progrefe in his love,

were attentive to her, while flie 
read the ftory, of which the fub- 
ftance was as follows : 
King ALPHONSO the Noble, &c. 
In the time of Alphonfo the 
Noble, king of Caftile, who won 
the famous battle againft the Mi- 
ramolin of Morocco in Sierra Mo-

rena, there lived an old knight 
named Mendoron, who after having 
diftinguiflicd himfelf in that fight, 
retreated to a folitary place called ' ' 
Villa-hermofa near Signenza. A- 
mong the olive and almond trees,, 
with which that fpot abounds, he 
built a fmall convenient houfe; on 
one fide of which was a mofl: de- 
lightful garden, and in it a fine 
canal. In cultivating this agree- 
able place lay his greatell pleafure. 
It happened that Alphonfo the 
Noble came during the fummer, to 
amufe himfelf at a royal caftle 
in that part of the country. When 
hearing of Mendoron's fine garden, 
he had a great defire to fee it. He 
therefore fcnt him word, that him-

the time appointed, and brought 
with him the marquefs pf Medina 
and three other favourites. 
They fate down to table by the

ferved up in the moft delicate

about fixteen years of age, and were 
both of excellent beauty. Their 
chefnut- coloured hair was tied be- 
hind with a ribbon of crimfon and 
gold. Their garments were of thin 
Murcian filk as white as fnow, 
and were tied round their waift 
with a cord of mohair and gold ; 
and thence defcended to only half 
way their legs, which were naked, 
and of moft delicate turn and white- 
nefs. On their feet they had li^ht 
fandals faftened with filver laces.. 
One of them carried a filk net, 
and the other a long fmooth branch 
of an almond tree, 
Alphonfo was greatly furprifed 
^tt their appearance, and waited at-

The damfels, being come before 
him, made their obeyfance to him, 
in the modefteft manner. Then 
both ftept into a fine gondola, that 
lay by the bank of the canal. 
There they caught a number of fifh 
and threw them out to a fervant, 
who had kindled a fire of fweet 
wood on the bank; and who drefled 
them in a filver veflel, and fet them 
before the king. After a litrie 
time they came out of the gondola, 
and having again faluted Alphonfo 
they returned into the houfe. 
Alphonfo and the reft admired 
greatly the beauty of the two 
damfels: but efpecially Alphonfo, 
who began to look upon them'with

turning to Mendoron, he demanded 
who thofe two fair damfels Were. 
They are my daughters, faid he, 
born both at a birth : one of them 
is called Rofalinda, and the other 
Dolcereina. Alphonfo commended 
their beauty and behaviour: and 
now nothing remained to be ferved 
on the table but the defert; when 
the tv^^o damfels appeared again, 
but attired in richeft carnation

alfo of the flames of love. For

but with both fifters ; as they re- 
fembled each other like two peads.

He alighted from his coach, and 
handed out a young lady of a finr 
gular appearance. Her complexion 
was of a fine olive, her eyes blacic 
and fparkling, her hair fhort and 
curling. She had ear-rings of pearl

Don Valdoranos took his place at

perfonage with long black hair, and 
whofe complexion was of a dark

who this Indian w^s ; but no body 
chofe to afk the queftion, at that

for repofing ourfelves, than hearing

the beautiful Indian. To this re- 
queft he anfwered, that he would 
willingly obey her commands, both

I am lately come from the Bra-

Spain for the fervice of the king, 
which required my prefence ; and 
having waited all the month of

the cape of Buona Efperanza, with 
raging ftorms : and though we faw 
figns thereof, yet we could not

follow. 
We made a long run of almoft 
two hundred leagues from Brafil, 
the ocean and the winds all the 
while raging. A fiery comet ap- 
peared continually to the tenth day 
with a fearful alped: ; and the fea 
and heavens often changing ; the 
black and foul clouds having gather- 
ed together in a round form, and 
the wind feeming to come all 
againft us, as it were by reflexion : 
the fea being faint in deceitful 
calms. 
Our failors well knowing the 
tempefls that ufed to rage there, 
did not offer to fprea(i their fails 
to gather the wind, but handed

them immmediatcly. Prefcntly th? 
wind broke from the clouds with z 
flafh of lightening.* After its con- 
* Perhaps this was a prcfter wind, ^ 
strong wind that breaks out with lightening 
and flame ; or what the feilors call the 
Ox- eye f being a cloud in appearance at (irfl 
no bigger. Not far from the cape of Good 
Hope there is a high mountain, broad on 
the top like a table. When the fky is 
clear and the fea fnlooth, there is a little 
cloud feen on the top of this hill, which 
appears at firft no larger than a hazel-nut, 
and then like a walnut, which the Dutch 
call the Ox-eye ;  and then covers the whole 
plain above, and the Dutch compare it to 
a table fpread with all kinds of meat on it, 
from its different colours. Then the fiorm 
begins to blow from the top of the moun- 
tain with fuch force, as overwhelms all fhips 
that are not on their guard, or have their 
fails out. 
This wind is thus defcribed in Thomfon's

forced to put right before the wind 
to flow Qur anchor again, which 
we did with much ado. But 
afterwards we durfl not adventure 
to bring our (hip to the wind again 
for fear pf foundering, for the turn -

The next mprning was fine com-

a dead calm, not the leaft wind to

to caft anchor. We immediately 
put out our boat and made to land

trees loaded with beautiful fruits, 
which bowed the branches to the

thofe of which the birds had eat,

were of excellent tafte and flavour. 
When we had refreflied our-

I never faw a more agreeable place. 
It was full of ajOes trees, and other 
fine wood, of all forts of fruit trees, 
of fprings, and beauteous flpwcrs. 
It is furprifing that this iflnnd, 
though fo commodious and pleafant, 
is inhabited only by birds, hares, 
rabbits and wild goats. I imagine 
the fmallnefs of it to be the reafon,

that we had got fafe to'fo delicious

When the night came, we.rc- 
pofed ourfelves on the grafs, which 
was enamelled with a thoufand 
flowers of the fined odour. We 
flept delicloufly till morning. As 
the weather was ftill calm, and not 
the leaft wind, we refolded to ftay 
where we were a little longer : 
and after breakfaft, I went with fix

fur^cy of the ifland. 
We entered a wood of limes, 
which had divers walks in it, as if

He was fo intent upon his labour, 
that we were already near him 
before he perceived us; but as foon

he had in his hand in the greateft

though I did not recoiled him at 
firft, his drefs was fo ftrange, and

and he had on a woman's jacket of 
blue filk and tarniftied gold, and an

when he gave us this brief relation. 
It happened that in the courfe 
of a voyage to Mexico, a trading 
veiflel put into a creek, being in 
diftrefs for want of provifions. The 
Spaniards unadvifedly went a great 
diftancc from the fea up into the 
country, and in their return were 
intercepted by an ambufti of In- 
dians, who killed the greater part 
of them. The captain of the velTel, 
whofe name was Cabron, efcaped 
by flying into a forcft. Having 
wandered a long time, he at length 
arrived 
Chevalier Pier point. 125 
arrived in the deep reccfles of the 
wood, and being tired and fpent, 
he laid himfelf down to reft under 
a tree; when fuddenly an Indian 
maid, who had been hunting, came 
to the place where he was. She 
was dreft in fcveral beautiful co- 
loured feathers, and had a quiver 
on her (houlder, and a bow in her 
hand. As Cabron could fpeak the 
Indian tongue, he . fell at her feet, 
made his diftrefs known to her, 
and begged her protedlian. Ca- 
bron had a handfome perfon, and 
an engaging addrefs. Indora, (fo 
the Indian girl is named) farveyed 
his perfon, admired his drcfs ; took 
pity on him, and from pitying be- 
came enamoured with him, and 
126 M E M O I n s of the 
coniequently fblicitous for his pre^ 
fcrvation. Site kept him fecretly 
in a cave, which (he adorned for 
him with fcveral precious things, 
for flie was of the rank of the prin-? 
ces of her country. She brought 
him all forts of provifions of fruits 
and game, which (he took in 
hunting. They lived thus feveral 
months. 
At length a veflel appeared upon 
the coaft, to which by Cabron's 
diredion ftie made a fignal ; and 
he perfuaded her to embark with 
him. The captain of this veflel, 
in which I was bound for Spain, 
dealt in flaves. As fuch people 
have generally no feelings but for 
gain, after hearing the Indian 
"1 ^^TvcV^

bron to buy her of him. And 
what think ye? The generous 
Cabron fold Indora to him fi)r two 
hundred fequins of gold, taking 
advantage of her beauty, and her 
being fuppofed to be pregnant, to 
raife his price. In the mean time 
we were overtaken by a ftorm, and 
wrecked on this ifland. Not one 
efcaped the waves but Indora and 
myfelf. We have been here thefe 
thirteen months, living upon the 
fruits, which we found very good. 
I fet up fignals on feveral parts of 
the ifland, which perhaps you have 
feen, or the late tempeft has de-

The ufe of incenfe and perfumes

The fubjei^ of the tragedy was 
the life and death of King Pedro 
the Cruel ; for in Spain, fomc of 
the dramatic writers have little re- 
gard to time or place. 
Pedro, fumaittcd the Cruel, was 
king 
Chevalier PiERfoiNT. 137, 
king of Caftile. His father Al- 
phonfo XI. had feveral natural 
children by his miftrcfs, the beau- 
tiful Elconora de Gufman, Pedro, 
when he came to the crown, per-^ 
iidioufly put to death Elconara de 
Gufinan at Talavara. He caufed 
Garcelaflb de la Vega to be po- 
nyarded in the royal palace at Bur*- 
gos, whither he had invited him. 
His own brother Don Frederiquez, 
and his coufin Don Juan of Ar* 
ragon, were alfo ponyardcd in his 
prefcnce. He put to death his 
own aunt the queen of Arragon, as 
alfo his own queen Donna Bianca, 
the moft beautiful princefs of her 
time, and of the moil amiable 
charadcr. 
138 Memoirs of the

flames of a civil war. The bar-

tamar, one of the fons of Eleonora 
de Gufman, a prince noble and 
valiant, juftly thinking Pedro un- 
v^orthy to reign, caufed himfelf to 
be proclaimed king of Caftile. 
Pedro applied to Edward the Black 
prince, who was fovereign in Gui-^ 
cnne. Edward cfpoufed the ty- 
rant's lide, and marched to his af* 
fiftance. Soon after was fought, 
on the banks of the Ebro, that 
bloody battle, which is called 
by that name, between Tranftamar 
on one fide, and king Pedro and 
the 
Chevalier PierpoInt. 139 
the Black prince on the other.

revolted to the Black prince. King 
Pedro gained the vidtory. The 
fon of Eleonora de Gufinan was 
obliged to fly into Arragon : and 
Pedro was refettled in his throne. 
As foon as the Black prince was 
withdrawn, the valiant Tranfla'mar 
appeared again at the head of an 
army, compofed of Arragonians and 
Caftilians* Prince Tranftamargained 
a compleat vidtory over King Pedro, 
who was killed in the fight, and his 
crown and fignet were prefentcd to

From this prince defcended the 
kings of Caftile, who afterwards 
reigned in Spain, till the fceptre of 
that kingdom was transferred to 
the houfe of Auftria. Hiftorians 
tell us that he was loved by the 
Spaniards, whom he governed with, 
mildnefs and moderation. In a 
word, he was an happy king : 
he had no dark diftrufts of thofe 
about him; but tafted that generous 
confidence in the friendfhip of men, 
which is the fweeteft charm of life. 
This tragedy, though not written 
according to the rules, had grert 
excellencies. I obferved this to

damfel, who, it feems, calls heifelf 
Alexandra, got fight of it, and wa$ 
pleafed with its lullre. She found 
means to inform herfclf of his 
bufincfs, his name, and relations i 
and about evening fent a young 
woman to him, who found him 
fitting alone under fome trees at my 
gate. She afked if he was named 
Andrante; and he anfwering in the 
affirmative, fhe took him afide, and 
told him that a young lady would 
gladly fpeak with him, 
' The^ Burgofan, feeing the girl

Iii this imagination he followed the 
damfel to a fine houfe, where they 
went ivt. 
In a little time the lady^ being 
advertifed of his arrival, appeared 
at the top of a ft»r-cafe of green 
marble, that had a gilt ballufter- 
She was in appearance about eigh-

and richly dreft^ 
As foon as flie farw Andrante, (he

The Burgofan, quite aftonlflied

could only fay, that he 'was proud 
of the honour of waiting upon her. 
The fignora then took him by the 
hand, and without faying a word 
more, led him through a large 
dining room into her own chamber, 
which was perfumed with rofes, 
orange-flowers, and other coftly 
odours ; where was alfo a fine bed, 
adorned with gold galoon, and other 
rich furniture, which convinced 
him flie was fome great lady. 
They fate down together on a 
fopha. Then after fome preface, 
fhe told him a long plaufiblc ftory, 
wherein (he made it appear as clear 
as the light, that fhe was his fifter, 
by an amour which his father had 
mth a rich- widow of Valentia;

Don Valentin, a perfon of great 
diftindion at Toledo, who, fhe 
hoped, would foon be at home, 
After this {he enquired of all their 
relations by name. Andrante hear- 
ing a fable fo well ordered, and re- 
lated without the leaft helitation, 
and not a little plesUed with the 
endearments of fo young and 
charming a creature, did not in the 
leaft doubt of the truth of what 
fhe averred. Whence he ma<?e 
anfwer, that he thought himfelf 
happy in having found a fifter fo 
amiable, and that perfons of the 
higheft rank and fortune might 
be proud to have one adorned with 
iqch accomplilhnient?. 
Chevalier Pierpoint. 151 
In the mean time Don Valentin 
arrived, to whom Alexandra having 
made knov^rn her brother, the fignor 
loaded him with civilities and com- 
pliments. 
An elegant fuppcr was fcrved up^ 
with excellent wines. The enter- 
tainment was joyous. Andrante 
and his new brother drank freely 
till midnight. Alexandra would 
not fuffer him to depart, but or- 
dered an apartment for him. He 
was condudted thither, and a fine 
night-gown and embroidered flip- 
pers were laid ready for his ufe. 
He went tombed and flcpt foundly; 
but when he awaked in the morn-

enquiry he found the houfe he was 
in was not his fifter Alexandra's, 
but ready furnifhed lodgings : and 
the pcrfon who looked after them 
told him, that the lady he fupped 
with was gone away before it 
was light. He w-as now convinced 
too late of the treachery of his 
charming lifter, and came away 
in the filk night-gown and em- 
broidered flippers, forwhichhc had 
paid three hundred ducats of gold.

Don Valdoranos entertained us 
on the way with three or four con- 
certs of mufic at feveral ftations, 
where we refted the mules. 
My lord, faid Melefinda to him, 
your travelling in Spain with mufic 
is very delightful, efpecially thus 
in the ftillnefs of the night ; me- 
thinks I am wandering on fairy 
ground. 
In filent night, fwcct mufic brcaihe

Thefe verfes, which ihe had put

156 Memoirs of the

lency of mufic. 
Mufic, anfwered the knight of 
CalatraVa, is a kind of food and 
repaft of the foul ; a fweet re- 
frefhment of the mind. Plato com- 
manded that children fhould be 
taught mufic. The antients ufed 
it in battle, even lutes and inftru- 
ments of fofteft found. They ce- 
lebrated it as a thing facred and 
divine. They believed that our 
foul is harmony, and that it liftens 
and knows its power as often as it 
hears mufic, as a nature fimilar to 
itfelf. 
They held alfo, that the move- 
ments of the ftarry fpheres com- 
pofcd a concert. Man in bis firft

6ftate had his ears delighted with 
that ccleftial harmony 5 but our 
hearing is now too obftrufled fo^ 
that heavenly mulic. 
Mufic among thofe, who were 
ftiled the chofen people, was a re*- 
ligious art* Th^ fongs of Sion^ 
which we have reafon to believe 
were in high repute among the 
courts of the Eaftern kings, were 
nothing elfe but hymns, that ce-

How does our grand and folemn

What you fay, anfwered the 
knight, is extremely iuft. And wc 
learn from Homer, that muiic was 
conftantly made ufe of in the courts 
of all the oriental princes at their 
feafts. Solomon tells us, that he 
fought out finging men and finging 
women to entertain him at the time 
of feafting. Homer introduces his 
mufician Demodocus as a pcrfon of 
great diftinftion. H* ])laccs him 
on a throne ftudded with filvcr, znd 
gives him an herald for his attend-  
ant; nor is he lefs, careful to pro-

IN fuch difcourfe we beguiled the 
way till we arrived at Aran- 
juez. We faw already in the eaft 
a moft beautiful' Aurora, blufliing 
like rofes. AH the ftars were re- 
tired, except Venus, which guards 
the confines of the night, and from 
whence feemed to come a fragrant 
breeze, which filled the air with 
balmy fweets, and whiipered the 
chorifters of the groves to awake 
and renew their fongs. 
At Aranjuez, the avenues are Co 
long, that even from the middle, 
one cannpt fee the end of them.

coming into the gardens, we fan- 
cied ourfelves in the gardens of 
Alcinous, or of queen Armida. 
The morning was cool, on all fides 
the birds made a fweet melody, 
arid the waters a pleafing murmur. 
The trees and hedges were loaden 
with excellent fruits, and the par- 
terres covered with moft odoriferous 
flov^rers. 
The place was fo delicious, that 
we determined to Ipcnd a day or 
two in it. When the fun had 
dried up the dew, we breakfafted 
on a green plat furfounded with a 
^rove, 
Chevalfer Pier POINT, itj 
gtove, whofe trees wcrcJ large and 
crowned with tliick foliage, a- 
tnongft which * were a number of 
nightingales. 
The coOatefs Melefinda was ob- 
ferving to us thefe beauties, when, 
I faid. There are other beauties 
here, which yOu have 'not named* 
What do you mean, faid fhe, thofe 
[latucs that 'are before us there? 
For my part, I don't like them at 
ill. That firft one has a very odd 
ippearance. If reprefents a faun, 
; replied; the fauns were a fort 
)f woodland deities. They were 
)artly of the fatyr kind. They 
lad fomething of the ferine nature, 
is you fee by their tails, little gilt 
K?rns, arid pointed ears j but were

fwered Melcfindaj they (hall not 
come into my garden. Well, faid 
I fmiling, how do you like that 
other ftatue ? Extreamly, faid fhe ; 
I fancy it is my favourite Pomona. 
In one hand (he holds the horn of 
abundance, filled with the various 
rich fruits of autumn. In the other 
hand (he holds a golden urn, from 
which pieces of gold fallpromifcuouf- . 
ly. So that at the fame time, fhc 
holds the fruits of the earth, the riches 
of nature, and thofe treafures on 
which piankind fet fo great a value. 
Upon my word, Melefinda, faid I, 
you talk very learnedly concerning 
this^your favourite nymph. ,But 
Chevalier Pierpoint. 169 
you can't tell me the reafon why 
her head is a little inclined. Yes, 
I can, faid flie fmiling, it is becaufe 
all ftatues that are placed at any > 
height, to be viewed by people 
ftanding under them, are fet in the * 
faireft point of light, when they 
are inclined towards the fpedator. 
Perceiving I was going to fpeak. 
Hold, faid fhe, I have not yet done 
with this ftatue ; it always charms 
me. Pomona's hair you fee is part- 
ed before, and with a beautiful, 
eafy,' negligent grace, part hangs 
in natural ringlets of gold, we will 
imagine ; the reft is bound behind 
her neck. Her gown fits with the 
fame negligent air. A rich girdle 
binds it up, that fhe may walk with

ij6 Memoirs of the

is full of folds, a niore agreeable ' 
drapery than the modetn' ftrait ^ 
drefles. The workman's, hainci 
feems to have foftened the marble, 
to make the folds appear the more 
fine and elegant. Under that dra- 
pery you behold fome parts naked, 
fo that at the fame time you fee the ' 
foftnefs of the nymph's form, and 
the variety of her vefture's folds. 
The amirante hearing her ^eak 
in this ftile, flood in admiraticMi,. 
and politely confefied that Jhe had 
informed him of what he never *

taking off a firje large riiby, which

faying, that he dcfired her to ac- 
cept it for the inriruftion flie had 
given him. He Jtdded likewife, 
that there was a ftrahge property 
in that ruby, for when any thing 
troublefomcr was to happen to him, 
its luftre faded, and that when any 
thing agreeable was to arrive, it 
then flidrie with an uncommon luf- 
tre*, as it had done all the morri-

After examining fome other fine 
ftatues, a queftioA arofe amongft us, 
whether ftatuary excelled painting. 
The brafs or marble, faid baron 
Swcnit^, exprefles the contour of 
the limbs, their length, thicknefs, 
flendernefs; in fbort, all their di- 
men lions may be feen in ftatues, 
but not in paintings, in which 
there is only a fuperficies, linea- 
ments, and a fine fucus and fallacy 
of colour. Grant you, replied the 
knight, that ftatues bear the ef- 
figies of living things, in as much 
as 
Chevalier Pierpoint. 173 
as they are rounder, and pidlurts 
appear only as things merely fuper- 
ficial ; yet they have in them fever al 
things, which ftatues have not. 
For the painter naturally exprefles 
light and fhades, chiaro ofcuro, 
as alfo what is ferene, thick and 
denfe, more or lefs as the Tubjedt 
requires ; which a llatuary can by 
no means do. And though paint- 
ing is not capable of foundnefs of 
figure, in the manner as ftatuafy, 
yet does it fo curioufly circumvolve 
the limbs and mufcles, that they 
may wonderfully bear proportion 
with thofc parts, which we do not 
fee, and gice us juft caufc to pro- 
nounce the painter admirably (killed 
in his art. And as he forms witb 
174 .Memoirs of the

fore-fhortened, or fometimes pro-

^pieaies, he ftands in need of ano-

The Hiftory of 
Don Cleon de Ax^tamira, 
AND 
Don Fernando de Melon. 
AT the time, when Charles, 
afterwards emperor, was 
difputing for the crown of Spain 
with the duke of Anjoii,'' there 
dwelt in Catalonia a gentleman, 
galled Don Mofcofo de. Altamira, 
who having a fon named Cleon dc 
Altamira, a youth of fine parts and 
Jearning, fent him to Leon to 
ftudy 
Chevalier Pij:rpoint. 187 
ftudy philofophy, recommending 
him to a nobleman there, called 
Don Gabriel de Melon, who was 
bis old friend. This nobleman, 
inftead of putting him to the uni- 
verfity, kept him in his own houfe 
as a companion to his fop, naintd 
Ferdinando de Melon, and tiiey 
were both configned to the tuiti.^a 
of a philofopber, whofc name was 
Bertonel. 
Being thus brought up togcthc;;. 
their inclinations and tempers we.^^ 
fo conformable, that a brotheily 
affedlion and ftrift friendfhip fpruug 
up between them, nor had ti <^y 
either happinefs or fatisfa<3:ion h\xt 
in each other's company. As u^cy 
had both an excellent UivJer--^ ^

dcrftanding, they became eminent 
in their ftudies, to the great joy 
of Don Gabriel de Melon^ who 
feemed to have the fame efteem 
and love for both. 
In a little time old De Melon, 
being now very ancient, died : at 
which both youths exprcfled an 
equal concern, nor could it be well 
faid, which was moft difconfolate. 
In a few months afterwards, the 
relations of young De Melon came 
to fee him, and endeavoured to 
confole him and his friend. They 
propofed to Don Ferdinand to 
marry, and recommended to him 
a young lady of great beauty and 
accomplifhments, ^bout fixteen 
years of age. 
Ferdinand 
Chevalier Pierpoint. 189 
Ferdinand confented to what 
they defired of him, and after two 
or three vifits to Donna Silviana^ 
for that was the young lady's name, 
he perfuaded his friend Cleon to go 
one day with him to vifit her. 
Cleon being introduced to her, 
while they converfed together, view- 
ed her charms with much attention, 
as confidering her the beautiful 
objedt that was to be his friend's 
happinefs. But alas ! he was in 
another vifit or two fo taken with 
her excellent beauty of perfon, a'tid 
qualifications of mind, that he be- 
came himfclf enamoured with her 
to the moft violent degree of paf- 
fion. Notwithftanding which, he 
kept his flame concealed, nor gave 
the 
190 MBMoiitsofthe 
theleaftiign of it. But the flame 
of love^ when confined^ the rmt 
it bums. When in iblitude he 
thought on Silviana's charms, the 
more he became in loye. 
RecoUeding himfelf at laft, after 
many paffionate fighs, he broke 
out to this effcdt : Unhappy Cleon ! 
on whom haft thou fixt thy af- 
fcdion ? Ought not the favours 
thou haft received from Don Fer- 
dinand and his family* as well as 
ihe ties of moft entire friendfliip 
iubfifting between you, make you 
think no more of Silviana ? Let 
reaibn overcome this paflion, and 
direft thy eyes to fome oVher lady. 
Extinguifli the fparks of this love,

Let older people ftudy what is ho- 
nourable. I can will nothing but 
to love* l^jbu Silvianas beauty 
commands from every one. How 
am I then to blame ? 
Thus he argued differently with 
himfelf,. not one day, and one 
night only, but feveral, till the 
ftruggle between his friendihip and 
his 
192 Memoirs of the 
his love caufed him to fall fick> 
and he was forced to keep his 
chamber. 
Don Ferdinand had obfervedhim, 
for fome time,, to be penfive, and to 
afFedt folitudc; and now feeing him 
fall fick, was extreamly grieved, 
and fought by all manner of means 
to comfort him, preffing earneftly 
to know the caufe of his grief. 
To which he returned frivolous 
anfwers far from ithc truth, and 
which Don Ferdinand plainly faw 
to be fuch. As he ftill continued 
urgent to know the real cauie, 
Cleon, compelled, as it were, at 
length to ipeak, began with fighs 
and tears to tell him the whole 
caufe of his uneafinefs and conflidl 
with 
Chevalier Pierpoint. 193

the vidlory inclined, owning his ex- 
tream paffion for Silviana, and de-. 
daring, upon account of its dif- 
honourablencfs, his refolution to 
cxtinguifh his flame with his death, 
which he hoped would foon happen, 
Don Ferdinand hearing this dif- 
courfe, and feeing his trouble, and 
the violence of his love, flood 
fome time in fufpence, as having a 
love for Silviana, though in a more 
moderate degree. But at length 
his friend's life was preferred, and 
fympathifing with him, he faid; 
Cleon, was it not that you ftand 
more in need of comfort, I fhould

diflionourable, yet ought it namore 
to be concealed than if it was

riend to rejoice at what redounds 
to his friend^s credit, it is no Icfs 
fo to attempt' to drive from that 
friend's heart, what he judges con- 
trary to honour. 
But to leave this fubjed, and 
come to that, whereof you ftand 
moft in need. If you are fo paffion- 
ately in love with Silviana, I am 
not at all furprifed at it ; but fliould

But to draw to a conclufion. 
Though Clcon was afhamed to give 
his confcnt, yet love, and his friend's 
importunities prevailed at length, 
Don Mofcofo vifited Silviana no 
more. While Cleon by his afli- 
duity, engaging perfon, and win- 
ning behaviour, gained her affec- 
tions, to the mutual fatisfadlion of 
all three. For Don de Melon 
having overcome his paflion for Sil- 
viana by force of friendfhip and 
abfence, married his friend's lifter 
Donna Florinda, an agreeable young 
lady, and both friends living near 
one another, every day added fome- 
thing, if poflible, to their felicity. 
A moft facred thing therefore is.

grant, are hardly to be met vrith,

Suppofing therefore, my young lords, 
that you vsrere not relations, yet

and that the facred obligations of 
true friendfhip ought to ferve in- 
ftead of all degrees of affinity. 
Here Don Valdoranos made an 
end. We were extreamly delighted 
with his noble and excellent hif- 
tory; as alfo with his dignity and 
grace in relating it. But it made 
fuch an impreffion on Don Fernanda 
and 
Chevalier Pier point. 199 
and Don dc Silva, that they rofe up, 
as with one accord, and each of 
them taking a hand of the old ami- 
rante, ardently returned him thanks, 
not without tears. I confent, my 
lord, faid Don Fernand, ftill grafp- 
ing his hand, and fwear by all that 
is facred, to acquiefce in Dalinda s 
choice, whether (he determines in 
favour of me, or of my coulin.— 
And as for me, faid Don de Silva in 
his turn, I call the ftars to witnefs, 
that if Dalinda does not pronounce 
in my favour, I will remove far 
diftant from her charms j and if I 
cannot forget her, at leaft will ne- 
ver fee her more. There remains 
then only, faid the amirante, that 
you embrace one another in token 
,of 
200 Mem 1 R s, * 
of your recondliation ; which they 
immediately did with much ten- 
dcmefs, and feeming cordiality. 
This affair fo happily ended, we 
all returned to the palace, where 
wepafled the evening together* with 
great feftivity. And Don Fernand 
and Don de Silva would attend the 
amirante to Madrid the next morn- 
ing.
