 Yak strot stared like a skewered pig  After some pause  the president Soosan sin o ventured to observe  that the measure seemed to be a little abrupt and premature  that the nation was already engaged in a very expensive war  which had absolutelutely drained it of its wealth  and even loaded it with enormous debts  therefore little able to sustain such additional burthens as would  in all probability  be occasioned by a rupture with a prince so rich and powerful  Gotto mio swore the land holders were already so impoverished by the exactions of Taycho  that he himself  ere long  should be obliged to   97 upon the parish  Fika kaka got up to speak  but could only cackle  Sti phi rum poo was for proceeding in form by citation  Nin kom poo po declared he had good intelligence of a fleet of merchant ships belonging to Corea  laden with treasure  who were then on their return from the Indian isles  and he gave it as his opinion  that they should be way laid and brought into the harbours of Japan  not by way of declaring war  but only with a view to prevent the money s going into the coffers of the Chinese emperor  Fokh si rokhu started two objections to this expedient  first  the uncertainty of falling in with the Corean fleet at sea  alledging as an instance the disappointment and miscarriage of the squadron which the Sey seo gun had sent some years ago to intercept the Chinese Fune on the coast of Fat sisio  secondly  the loss and hardship   98 it would be to many subjects of Japan who dealt in commerce  and had great sums embarked in those very Corean bottoms  Indeed Fokh si rokhu himself was interested in this very commerce  The Fatz man sat silent  Yak strot  who had some romantic notions of honour and honesty  represented that the nation had already incurred the censure of all its neighbours  by seizing the merchantships of China  without any previous declaration of war  that the law of nature and nations  confirmed by repeated treaties  prescribed a more honourable method of proceeding  than that of plundering like robbers  the ships of pacific merchants  who trade on the faith of such laws and such treaties  he was  therefore  of opinion  that if the king of Corea had in any shape deviated from the neutrality which he professed  satisfaction should be demanded in the   99 usual form  and when that should be refused  it might be found necessary to proceed to compulsive measures  The Dairo acquiesced in this advice  and assured Taycho that an ambassador should be forthwith dispatched to Corea  with instructions to demand an immediate and satisfactory explanation of that prince s conduct and designs with regard to the empire of Japan   This regular method of practice would by no means suit the purposes of Taycho  who rejected it with great insolence and disdain  He bit his thumb at the president  forked out his fingers on his forehead at Gotto mio  wagged his under jaw at the Cuboy  snapt his fingers at Sti phi rum poo  grinned at the Sey seo gun  made the sign of the cross or gallows to Fokh si rokhu  then turning to Yakstrot  he clapped his thumbs in his ears  and began to bray like an ass    100 finally  pulling out the badge of his office  he threw it at the Dairo  who in vain intreated him to be pacified  and wheeling to the right about  stalked away  slapping the flat of his hand upon a certain part that shall be nameless  He was followed by his kinsman the Quo Lob kob  who worshipped him with the most humble adoration  He now imitated this great original in the signal from behind at parting  and in him it was attended by a rumbling sound  but whether this was the effect of contempt or compunction  I could never learn   Taycho having thus carried his point  which was to have a pretence for quitting the reins of government  made his next appeal to the blatant beast  He reminded the many headed monster of the uninterrupted success which had attended his administration  of his having supported the glorious Brut an tiffi    101 the great bulwark of the religion of Bupo  who had kept the common enemy at bay  and filled all Asia with the fame of his victories  He told them  that for his own part  he pretended to have subdued Fatsisio in the heart of Tartary  that he despised honours  and had still a greater contempt for riches  and that all his endeavours had been solely exerted for the good of his country  which was now brought to the very verge of destruction  He then gave the beast to understand that he had formed a scheme against the king of Corea  which would not only have disabled that monarch from executing his hostile intentions with respect to Japan  but also have indemnified this nation for the whole expence of the war  but that his proposal having been rejected by the council of Twenty eight  who were influencd by Yak strot  a Ximian mountaineer   102 without spirit or understanding  he had resigned his office with intention to retire to some solitude  where he should in silence deplore the misfortunes of his country  and the ruin of
