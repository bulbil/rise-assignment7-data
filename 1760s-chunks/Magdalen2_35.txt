on her knees  and kissing my hand with great eagerness    you have been long entitled to our utmost services—to the everlasting prayers of me and my whole family —Your ladyship s munificent hand  and your noble brother s  have been the blessed instruments of Providence  to snatch both me and mine from destruction —Your ladyship may remember the unhappy farmer Jenkins  of Salisbury  who was thrown into gaol through the inhumanity of a brutal landlord  for resenting an indecent liberty taken with his daughter  I  Madam  was wife to that Jenkins  and mother to that daughter —Your gracious brother redeemed my husband from prison  and gave a marriage portion with my child —Your ladyship scarcely heard of Sir Robert s   208 unexampled generosity  before you sent us down such a sum  as enabled us to pay off all our debts  and set us  once more  above the frowns of the world —We were utterly unknown both to your brother and you  and had no recommendation to your pity  but the merit of our distress —May the great God of heaven and earth  shower down eternal blessings upon both your heads  and may you both feel that happiness a hundred times doubled  with which you filled the hearts of both me and mine     Grateful  generously minded creature —My dear lady Blandford  you can t think how the tears rolled down my cheeks at this pathetic address —I remembered the name perfectly well  and it was the merit of my brother s behaviour on that occasion  which originally rivetted him to the bosom of Louisa —   209 You recollect the affair yourself  I dare say  for I believe I shewed you  as a curiosity  what a well written letter of thanks I received from poor Mrs  Jenkins  immediately after I had ordered the remittance  which dwelt so strongly upon the good woman s memory  I raised her up  you may be sure  as soon as I possibly could  and told her  that the young lady whom she had befriended so much  would  I hope  in a short time  honour my brother with her hand  as the match was what lay closely to the heart of both our families —She heard me with a look that indicated a wildness of satisfaction  and  bursting into a loud flood of tears  ran about the room  crying   Thank God —thank God —I have lived to be of some little use to my benefactors    You will undoubtedly be surprized  my dear lady Blandford  at finding the   210 wife of a poor husbandman expressing herself with such an air of elegance  as Mrs  Dobson —The heart of the meanest peasant may be as sentimentally elegant as a prince s—but it is education alone  which forms the delivery of our sentiments  and gives the customary characteristic of order and distinction —For my own part  I was so much surprized at her manner  that I could not help telling her how greatly it struck me—To which she modestly replied    That I was all goodness—but that her father was a curate in Wiltshire  who had several children  and not more than forty pounds a year—At the same time  therefore   continued she   that he took every necessary care about the improvement of our minds  he took care to bring us up in a manner that suited with the narrowness of our fortunes—so that we became somewhat remarkable through   211 the neighbourhood for our industry  and our education —We all married men of humble situations  and hence arises the trifling disparity which your ladyship is pleased to observe between our conversation and our circumstances   —But to go on—    Having shewn Louisa the letter I received from her father  she consented to go away with me instantly  but begged that Mrs  Dobson and Mrs  Carter would favour her with their company  whenever she took the liberty to request it —The worthy women assured her of their immediate concurrence  and we parted with many tears on both sides  after I had left a fifty pound bill for the use of the charity   Louisa was at my house about four days  when her father and her mother came to town —The dear girl  though   212 she impatiently longed to see them  was  however  extremely terrified at the thoughts of their approach   How  my dear lady Haversham   would she exclaim    shall I be ever able to look them in the face —There is one guilt which I acknowledge  and they have nothing but my own word to purge away the imputation of a second —Mrs  Darnell s assertion may be taken as soon as mine —Good God  how shall I look them in the face     They came at last—but with hearts prepossessed entirely as she could wish  They had seen some of Hastings s favourite servants  before their departure from the country  and  partly by menaces  and partly by bribes  they came at the truth  which corresponded exactly with the relation of Louisa —Sensible  therefore  only to her late sufferings    213 the father and the brother entirely forgot their resentment  on account of her original error  and the doating mother  who considered matters in a more tender light than either  was even ready
