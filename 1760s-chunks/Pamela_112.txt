 that she has reason   to think he has found out a way to satisfy my scruples  It is  by   marrying me to this dreadful Colbrand  and buying me of him on the   wedding day  for a sum of money   Was ever the like heard   She says   it will be my duty to obey my husband  and that Mr  Williams will be   forced  as a punishment  to marry us  and that  when my master has paid   for me  and I am surrendered up  the Swiss is to go home again  with the   money  to his former wife and children  for  she says  it is the custom   of those people to have a wife in every nation       But this  to be sure  is horrid romancing  Yet  abominable as it is    it may possibly serve to introduce some plot now hatching   With   what strange perplexities is my poor mind agitated  Perchance  some   sham marriage may be designed  on purpose to ruin me  But can a husband   sell his wife against her own consent   And will such a bargain stand   good in law          Monday  Tuesday  Wednesday  the 32d  33d  and 34th days of my   imprisonment       Nothing offers these days but squabblings between Mrs  Jewkes and me    She grows worse and worse to me  I vexed her yesterday  because   she talked nastily  and told her she talked more like a vile London   prostitute  than a gentleman s housekeeper  and she thinks she cannot   use me bad enough for it  Bless me  she curses and storms at me like a   trooper  and can hardly keep her hands off me  You may believe she   must talk sadly  to make me say such harsh words  indeed it cannot be   repeated  as she is a disgrace to her sex  And then she ridicules me    and laughs at my notions of honesty  and tells me  impudent creature   as she is  what a fine bed fellow I shall make for my master  and   such like   with such whimsical notions about me   Do you think this   is to be borne  And yet she talks worse than this  if possible  quite   filthily  O what vile hands am I put into          Thursday       I have now all the reason that can be  to apprehend my master will be   here soon  for the servants are busy in setting the house to rights  and   a stable and coach house are cleaning out  that have not been used some   time  I asked Mrs  Jewkes  but she tells me nothing  nor will hardly   answer me when I ask her a question  Sometimes I think she puts on these   strange wicked airs to me  purposely to make me wish for  what I dread   most of all things  my master s coming down  He talk of love   If he had   any the least notion of regard for me  to be sure he would not give   this naughty body such power over me   And if he does come  where is   his promise of not seeing me without I consent to it  But  it seems  his   honour owes me nothing  So he tells me in his letter  And why  Because   I am willing to keep mine  But  indeed  he says  he hates me perfectly    But it is plain he does  or I should not be left to the mercy of this   woman  and  what is worse  to my woful apprehensions          Friday  the 36th day of my imprisonment       I took the liberty yesterday afternoon  finding the gates open  to walk   out before the house  and  ere I was aware  had got to the bottom of the   long row of elms  and there I sat myself down upon the steps of a sort   of broad stile  which leads into the road  and goes towards the town    And as I sat musing upon what always busies my mind  I saw a whole   body of folks running towards me from the house  men and women  as in a   fright  At first I wondered what was the matter  till they came nearer    and I found they were all alarmed  thinking I had attempted to get off    There was first the horrible Colbrand  running with his long legs  well   nigh two yards at a stride  then there was one of the grooms  poor   Mr  Williams s robber  then I spied Nan  half out of breath  and the   cook maid after
