and I flurted up the other as soon as I got into the coach  It was a fine moon light morning  the postilion cracked his whip  and  though the roads were deep and dirty  the four horses darted away like lightning   I believe  madam  said I  you are by this time convinced that my scheme is too well laid to be baffled by any efforts you can make  I mean to treat you with due respect  and beg you will use me with a little more gentleness than you have done  that is all the favour I shall ask in return  till you yourself are disposed to shew me more     You are the most amazing creature  said she  that ever breathed  What is the meaning that  in the whole course of our acquaintance  your behaviour never gave me room to believe that you were serious in your designs on me  and now at once you souse upon your prey like a hawk  I’ll answer you in two words  said I  When we first met  you had a husband  since the renewal of our acquaintance  you’ll pardon me   it was no secret that you had a favoured lover in Mr Arnold  I am not of a temper to solicit a lady by stealth  and I would not give a pinch of snuff for the woman who is not intirely at my disposal  Your attachments to Arnold forbad this  and I was determined to have you all to myself  My attachments to Mr Arnold  cried she  impudently  again  Ay  said I  coolly  it began to be talked of so openly  that your reputation was mangled at every tea table in the country  and had you staid much longer there  you would have found yourself deserted by every female of character that knew you  Mr Arnold’s parting with his wife  was by every body charged to your account  and as she is reckoned a very good sort of a woman  was not that a pretty phrase    every one took her part  and were not sparing in their invectives against you  Add to all this  that Arnold has certainly run out his fortune  and is so involved that it will not be possible for him long to make those returns of generosity which your merit deserves —You and I have been acquainted long  I am no stranger to your circumstances  I know  at Captain Gerrarde’s death  your pension as his widow  and the very small jointure at Ashby  was the whole of your income  Arnold’s love  it is apparent  has hitherto been bountiful  how long it could be in his power to continue it so  may be a question worth your considering   I found I had mortified her pride  by mentioning the narrowness of her circumstances  and the demolition of her character  If all you say were true  Sir  which is far from being the case  with a toss of her head   you will find it no very easy matter to make me amends for what I shall perhaps lose for ever by this violence of yours  notwithstanding the smallness of my income  which you seem so well informed of  I have a considerable sum of money  and some valuable jewels  lying by me  of which my servants may very probably rob me  I assured her  upon my honour  I would make good to her every thing she should lose through my means  and would take care her situation should never be upon the same precarious footing which it had been  I did not chuse to mention the circumstance of my having secured her maid and her money too  I reserved that for an agreeable    surprize  I had measures to observe  I did not want to be on good terms with her too soon for obvious reasons  as nothing was farther from my heart than a thought of gallantry   For this purpose  I assumed a more distant behaviour  and affected to shew her something like respect  I did not drop the least hint of my knowing that Mr Arnold had made his lady uneasy on my account  much less that I suspected her for the wicked contriver of that mischief  I deferred the discussing of this point till a more favourable opportunity should offer  when it would be in my power to make a better use of it   My design was by degrees to make her satisfied enough with her situation  not to wish to return to Arnold  When I had once brought her to this  I judged it would not be difficult to carry her still farther  to the point I aimed at  and that was  to write a letter to him of my dictating  You will think this was a strange expectation  and yet it was what I resolved to accomplish  I knew the turn of the mind I had to deal with  bring a woman of this sort into good humour  and it is easy to wheedle her into compliance  She has no solid understanding  but possesses  in the place of it  a sort of flashy wit  that imposes on common hearers  and makes her pass for what is called clever  With a great deal of vanity  and an affectation of tenderness  which covers
