There we shall all huddle together again  my wife and my fellow comedians  who are making but little of the business  I wish we may not be obliged to beg our way out of town  a catastrophe of too frequent occurrence   At these words  up rose the stage struck hero  slung across him his knapsack and his sword  and made his exit with due theatric pomp  Farewell  gentlemen  may all the gods shower all their bounties on your heads  And you  answered Diego with corresponding emphasis  may you find your wife at Zamora  softened down in her relentless virtue  and in comfortable keeping  No sooner had Signor Zapata turned upon his heel  than he began gesticulating and spouting as he went along  The barber and myself immediately began hissing  to remind him of his first appearance at Madrid  The goose grated harsh upon his tympanum  he took it for a repetition of signals from his old friends  But looking behind him  and seeing that we were diverting ourselves at his expense  far from taking offence at this merry conceit of ours  he joined with good humour in the joke  and went his way laughing as hard as he could  On our part  we returned the compliment in kind  After this  we got again into the high road  and pursued our journey     CH  IX     The meeting of Diego with his family  their circumstances in life  great rejoicings on the occasion  the parting scene between him and Gil Blas   WE stopped for the night at a little village between Moyados and Valpuesta  I have forgotten the name  and the next morning  about eleven  we reached the plain of Olmédo  Signor Gil Blas  said my companion  behold my native place  So natural are these local attachments  that I can hardly contain myself at the sight of it  Signor Diego  answered I  a man of so patriotic a soul as you profess to be  might  methinks  have been a little more florid in his descriptions  Olmédo looks like a city at this distance  and you called it a village  it cannot be anything less than a corporate town  I beg its township s pardon  replied the barber  but you are to know that after Madrid  Toledo  Saragossa  and all the other large cities I have passed through in my tour of Spain  these little ones are mere villages to me  As we got further on the plain  there appeared to be a great concourse of people about Olmédo  so that  when we were near enough to distinguish objects  we were in no want of food for speculation   There were three tents pitched at some distance from each other  and hard by  a bevy of cooks and scullions preparing an entertainment  Here a party was laying covers on long tables set out under the tents  there a detachment was crowning the pitchers of Tellus with the gifts of Bacchus  The right wing was making the pots boil  the left was turning the spits and basting the meat  But what caught my attention more than all the rest  was a temporary stage of respectable dimensions  It was furnished with pasteboard scenes  painted in a tawdry style  and the proscenium was decorated with Greek and Latin mottoes  No sooner did the barber spy out these inscriptions  than he said to me    All these Greek words smell strongly of my uncle Thomas s lamp  I would lay a wager he has a hand in them  for between ourselves  he is a man of parts and learning  He knows all the classics by heart  If he would keep them to himself it would be very well  but he is always quoting them in company  and that people do not like  But then to be sure he has a right  because this uncle of mine has translated ever so many of the Latin poets and hard Greek authors with his own hand and pen  He has got all antiquity at his fingers  ends  as you may know by his ingenious and profound criticisms  If it had not been for him  we might never have learned that the Athenian school boys cried when they were flogged  we owe that fact in the history of education to his fundamental knowledge of the subject   After my fellow traveller and myself had looked about us  we had a mind to inquire what these preparations were for  Going about on the hunt  Diego recognized in the manager Signor Thomas de la Fuenta  to whom we made up with great eagerness  The schoolmaster did not recollect the young barber at first  such a difference had ten years made  But when convinced of his being his own flesh and blood  he gave him a cordial embrace  and said with much appearance of kindness    Ah  here you are  Diego  my dear nephew  here you are  restored after your wanderings to your native land  You come to revisit your household gods  your Penates  and heaven delivers you back safe and sound into the bosom of your family  Oh happy day  happy in all the proportions of arithmetic  A day worthy to be marked with a white stone and inserted among the Fasti  We
