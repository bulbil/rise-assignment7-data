it  though it did not answer   I have somewhere  I think in the Spectator  met a Comparison between the Effect  which Praise has on a generous Mind  and fine Weather  on a Thermometer  I like the Simile  and think it might be carried a great Way  I am not ashamed to own  that I receive the highest Transport from your Praise  It raises such a noble Emulation in my Mind  as would  were my Power equal to my Will  render me worthy of it  I think there is a Kind of Inspiration in your Praise  which might lead me to any great or virtuous Act  Add to this  that it sets my Faults and Foibles in the strongest Light  I consider you as the Person  who has bestowed the Merits you approve of  Page  124 and find myself ashamed of every Weakness I discover in myself  which may lessen them  In short  it has the same Effect on the Qualities of my Mind  which our Belief of the divine Omnipresence ought to have on all our Actions  May my dear Harry continue still to see me with the same Eyes of Fondness   till  by never ceasing to desire  I  at last  deserve his Praise  and so  as you somewhere say    strengthen Habit into Virtue     Notwithstanding your repeated Interdictions  I must ask one Question  Why should you endeavour to get the better of that natural Softness  you say you are possessed of  why lay yourself under a Restraint  to appear indifferent to the Woman you love  You cannot be ashamed of that Passion  which is the Boast of human Nature  If then you thought the Object worthy of your Tenderness  why should you wish to suppress it  nay  why not boast   the graceful Weakness of your Heart   I must say  you are a Laggard in the Race of Love  I have out stripped  and left you far behind   My Anthony is fat  and scant of Breath   At the Hazard of every thing  that is dear to me  I have proclaimed my Fondness  and do you blush at your s  Indeed I claim no Merit from the too public Confession of my Love — I could not help it  for  I am made a shallow  forded Stream  seen to the Bottom  all my Clearness Page  125 scorned  and all my Faults exposed   My Nature is not capable of Disguise  nor do I wish it were —I hope we shall never dispute on this  or any other Subject  I do  indeed  believe you love me  and shall conclude with your own Quotation   that  if it should be a Mistake  I would not part with the Belief of it  for a Certainty of the highest Good in this World     I am sorry I ever thought of leaving England  It has cost me much Uneasiness  I am still undetermined  I fear my Resolution will not stand the Shock of quitting you  Believe me  I have nothing else to encounter —My Interest and Pleasure both point the Way  yet still I loiter here  If my Going were fixed  I should suffer as much on your Account  as my own  Absence  and a strong Probability of never meeting more  might  perhaps  make us both regret our having ever met  The Delicacy of my Love is shocked  by supposing we shall ever repent our mutual Affection  or Engagements  yet  under the Circumstances I have mentioned  it is not impossible that it should happen  While we retain the pleasing  Expectation of seeing each other  our Thoughts are all employed on the approaching Joy  and every intervening Object appears scarce worthy our Regard  But  were we parted with a moral Certainty  that Years must roll before we meet again  would it not be natural to seek for a Consolation among those  Page  126 who could best make Amends for the Loss we had sustained  and who can say to their Heart   thus far shalt thou go  and no farther  — You have loved before  and may again  This Thought  I own  disturbs me  But why should I torment myself with  I hope  groundless Fears  for I will not part with thee —Let me be satisfied that you desire my Stay  then find the Pleasure  or Advantage  that shall force me from thee —Let not this Confession put you under any Restraint  for this be assured of  though  at your Desire  I would chearfully forego every other Happiness in Life  I will  if you require it  as readily embrace the Prospect of an everlasting Separation —My Heart shall only feel  not speak it s Anguish  Here give me Leave to remind you of a Conversation we had on this Subject some little Time before you left London  The Amount of it was  that  when I left the Kingdom  we should no longer maintain any Correspondence  but mutually endeavour to forget each other  To this I stedfastly adhere  For why should we strive to make each other more unhappy  If I go  I again repeat my Desire of not seeing you  Indeed I could not
