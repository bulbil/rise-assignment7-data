down  is one of the solemn points which precede one of the most solemn circumstances of my life  You seem more in earnest for an early day than I could have expected  When I have declared that affectation has no part in the more distant compliance  I may be allowed  by the nicest of my own Sex  to lay open to a man so generous  tho  so precipitating  my whole heart  Indeed    196 Sir  it is wholly yours—I blushed  as I felt  and turned away my face  It was a free declaration  But I was resolved to banish affectation  He bowed profoundly on my hand  and kissed it  Gratitude looked out in his eyes  and appeared in his graceful manner  tho  attentively silent   You was my deliverer  proceeded I  An esteem founded on gratitude  the object so meritorious  ought to set me above mere forms—Our judges say that you have the advantage in the argument   I will lay no stress  madam  on this part of their judgment in my favour—To your goodness  and to that so nobly acknowleged esteem  I wholly refer myself   I myself think  proceeded I  that you have the advantage in the argument—All that is in my power  I would wish to do  to oblige you—  Condescending goodness —Again he bowed on my hand   Do you think  Sir—  Why hesitates my Love   Do you think  six weeks—  Six ages  my dearest  dearest creature —Six weeks  For Heaven s sake  madam—He looked  he spoke  impatience   What can a woman  who has owned your title to expect to be obliged  say —let me  at least  ask  and I unaffectedly hesitated  a month  Sir—from this day—And that you will acknowlege yourself not perversely or weakly treated   He dropt on one knee  and kissing my hand  once  twice  thrice  with rapture  Within the month  then I hope—I cannot live a month from you—Allow me to return in the first fortnight of the month—  O Sir  and take up your residence with us  on your return   Undoubtedly  madam —Consider  Sir—Do you also  dearest madam  consider  and banish me not from you for so very long a time     197 My heart wanted  I thought  to oblige him  but to allow him to return sooner  as he was to take up his abode with us  what was that  but  in effect  complying with his first proposal   Permit me  Sir  to retire  Indeed you are too urgent   He asked my excuse  but declared  that he would not give up his humble plea  humble he called it  unless my grandmamma and aunt told him  that he ought   On his leaving me to return to company below  he presented me with four little boxes  Accept  my beloved Miss Byron  said he  of these trifles  I received them not till this morning  While I had the Day to hope from you  my heart would not suffer me to offer them  least you should suspect me mean enough to imagine an influence from them  I oblige myself by the tender  and I comply with custom  which I am fond of doing  whenever I can innocently do it  But I know  that you  my dear Miss Byron  value the heart more than a thousand times the value of these—Mine  madam  is yours  and will be yours to the end of my life   What could I say —My heart  on recollection  reproaches me for my ungraceful acceptance  I courtesied  I was silly  Sir Charles Grandison only can be present to every occasion   He looked as if my not refusing them was a favour more than equivalent to the value of the presents  My dearest life  said he  on my putting them on my toilette  how much you oblige me —Shall I conduct you to our friends below  Will you acquaint your grandmamma and aunt with our debate  and my bold expectation   I stood still  He took my hand  pressed it with his lips  and  with a reverence more than usually profound  as if he had received instead of conferred a favour  withdrew  Never was a present so gracefully   198 made  I cannot describe the grace with which he made it   My uncle  it seems  as soon as he went down  asked him  How we had settled the great affair  My grandmamma and aunt in a breath  as he paid his compliments to them  asked him  If their Harriet had been good —or  as good as he expected   Miss Byron  said he  has taken more time than I could have wished she had  A month  she talks of   Has she complied so far  said my grandmamma  I am glad of it  I was afraid she would have insisted upon more time—So was I  said my aunt  But who can withstand Sir Charles Grandison  Has the dear girl given you the very day  Sir   No  madam  If she had  I should have hoped it would have been
