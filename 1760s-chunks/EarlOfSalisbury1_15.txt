at the final issue  of this dangerous contest  He prest the hand of Lord William with an  affectionate warmth  and congratulated him on his victory over his base  and treacherous foe  a victory much more compleat  much more mortifying  to his rival  than could possibly have been acquired by arms  But the  Earl soon restrained his joy  by acquainting him  that this event did  not put an end to his dangers  Randolph once more composed himself into  a grave and earnest attention  and Lord William thus resumed the story  of his fortunes         To retire from this odious scene of my calamity  was now the great  purpose upon which my soul was fixed  I had leisure to indulge my wishes  to regain my friends  my country and my wife  and earnestly entreated  Les Roches to crown all his goodness by speedily recalling my  countrymen  and providing a vessel to convey us to the English shore  He  expressed his surprize and concern at this request  he urged the danger  of attempting a return  without a force sufficient to defend me against  an enemy who could not be a stranger to such a design  and whose deadly  hate must prompt him to arrest me in my passage  No  my friend  said he   attend us into France  South of the city of Poictiers my castle lies  at  no inconvenient distance from the coast  Thither permit me to conduct  thee  and thence with a retinue befitting his greatness  shall Earl  William be attended in honour and security to England      The  apprehensions of falling once more into the hands of malice and insolent  revenge  prevailed over my impatience  and determined me to embrace this  friendly counsel  A few chosen followers were dispatched to Rochelle   where my countrymen lay in anxious expectation of their leader  who  informed them of our fortunes  and  after an interval of some days   returned with all conveniences for transporting the forces of Les  Roches  Our embarkation wore a gay and gallant aspect  conducted with  chearfulness and zeal  without fear of danger or controul  The last  vessel had now received my friend and me  and was on the point of  leaving the shore  when we discovered a soldier hastening down towards  us  and with extended arms entreating to he received  We demanded his  name  and the reason of his extraordinary appearance   Alas  cried he   with that abasement which marks out calamity and oppression  but  yesterday the officer of Mal leon  favoured and honoured by my leader   now the victim of his wild revenge  unless your protection shall deign  to shield the unfortunate D Aumont   Here our attention was awakened   and I soon discovered that he was that messenger who the morning before  our intended combat  had accosted me with those overtures which fear  had extorted from Mal leon  As he stood upon the beach  with the  passionate warmth of a sincere and deeply pierced mind  the soldier thus  proceeded   When insolent revenge and cruelty point their ungenerous  fury against a valiant but unfortunate rival  what heart must not be  moved  and what brave son of war can conceal his indignation  Let the  coward dissemble his emotions  alas I have not learned his virtue  nor  know I that mean reserve which he calls prudence  Lord Salisbury is the  enemy of Count Savourè  but a gallant and an honourable enemy  Let me  ever emulate his exalted virtues  and scorn the base and cruel envy  that would oppress them  We were soon no strangers to his fortunes  and  while the abject minions of a proud Lord suppressed their pity  my  thoughts were not so  obedient to controul  they forced their way boldly  and surprized my  fellow soldiers with the most ardent expressions of indignation at the  malice of our leader  whose flatterers treasured up the dangerous  discourse  and failed not to convey it faithfully to his ear  And now  D Aumont was marked out for destruction  when rage and vengeance were  ready to seize me  I fled  If my services may merit your protection   use them  and save me from ruin  Should Savourè spare and forgive me   witness  ye holy angels  this arm shall never draw it s weapon for that  dishonourable Lord  No  if I am abandoned  let me wander in disgraceful  obscurity  let me feel the hard hand of want and poverty  or let me die  rather than be made  perhaps  the minister of bloody cruelty on some  brave soldier  who hath become odious by his virtues  —Dangerous  hypocrisy  how exactly canst thou assume the fairest semblances of  goodness  O why should generous and ingenuous minds be more particularly  the prey of thine accursed artifice —We received him without the least  difficulty or suspicion  and his wiley arts of insinuation not only  wrought us to pity  but soon commanded our affections and implicit  confidence  On me his attention was perpetually engaged  ever  officious in performing all the little offices
