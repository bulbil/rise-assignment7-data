Char  If you will not excuse me then  I will tell you the story   Mr  Jor  Pray  Sir—  Sir Ch  I had a misunderstanding at Venice with a young gentleman of the place  He was about twenty two  I was a year younger—  Mr  Bag  At the Carnival  I suppose —About a Lady  Sir Charles   Sir Ch  He was the only son of a noble Venetian family  who had great expectations from him  He was a youth of genius  Another noble family at Urbino  to which he was to be allied in marriage  had also an interest in his welfare  We had made a friendship together at Padua  I was at Venice by his Invitation  and stood well with all his family  He took offence against me  at the instigation of a designing relation of his  to own the truth  a Lady  as you suppose  Mr  Bagenhall  his Sister  He would not allow me to defend my innocence to the face of the accuser  nor yet to appeal to his father  who was a person of temper as well as sense  On the contrary  he upbraided me in a manner that I could hardly bear  I was resolved to quit Venice  and took leave of his whole family  the Lady excepted  who would not be seen by me  The father and mother parted with me with regret  The young gentleman had so managed  that I could not with honour appeal to them  and  at taking leave of him in their presence  under pretence of a recommendatory Letter  he gave into my hand a written challenge  The answer I returned  after protesting my innocence  was to this effect     I am setting out for Verona in a few hours  You know my principles  and I hope will better consider of the matter  I never  while I am master of my temper    52 will give myself so much cause of repentance to the last hour of my life  as I should have  were I to draw my Sword  to the irreparable injury of any man s family  or to run the same risque of injuring my own  and of incurring the final perdition of us both      Mr  Mer  This answer rather provoked than satisfied  I suppose   Sir Ch  Provocation was not my intention  I designed only to remind him of the obligations we were both under to our respective families  and to throw in an hint of a still superior consideration  It was likely to have more force in that Roman Catholic country than  I am sorry to say it  it would in this Protestant one   Sir Har  How  how  Sir Charles did it end   Sir Ch  I went to Verona  He followed me thither  and endeavoured to provoke me to draw  Why should I draw  said I  Will the decision by the sword be certainly that of Justice  You are in a passion  You have no reason to doubt either my skill  or my courage  On such an occasion  Gentlemen  and with such a view  a man may perhaps be allowed to give himself a little consequence   And solemnly once more do I avow my innocence  and desire to be brought face to face with my accusers   He raved the more for my calmness  I turned from him  with intent to leave him  He thought fit to offer me a personal insult—I now  methinks  blush to tell it—He gave me a box on the ear  to provoke me to draw—  Mr  Mer  And did you draw  Sir   Mr  Bag  To be sure you then drew   Mr  Jord  Pray  Sir Charles  let us know  You could not then help drawing  This was a provocation that would justify a Saint   Sir Ch  He had forgot  in that passionate moment   53 that he was a gentleman  I did not remember that I was one  but I had no occasion to draw   Sir Har  What a plague—You did not cane him   Sir Ch  He got well after a fortnight s lying by   Sir Har  Damnation   Sir Ch  I put him into possession of the lodgings I had taken for myself  and into proper and safe hands  He was indeed unable for a day or two to direct for himself  I sent for his friends  His servant did me justice as to the provocation  Then it was  that I was obliged  in a Letter  to acquaint the father of a discovery I had made  which the son had refused to hear  which  with the Lady s confession  convinced them all of my innocence  His father acknowleged my moderation  as the young gentleman himself  did  desiring a renewal of friendship  But as I thought the affair had gone too far for a cordial reconciliation  and knew that he would not want instigators to urge him to resent an indignity  which he had  however  brought upon himself  by a greater offered to me  I took leave of him and his friends  and revisited some
