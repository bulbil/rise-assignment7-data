to fear you cease to wish it  else why        this cruel absence  I have not seen you these three days   an age        to one that loves like me  I am racked to death with the        apprehensions of the motives of so unexpected a neglect  If my        person or passion were unworthy your regard  why did you accept        them with such enchanting softness  And if ever I had any place in        your affection  what have I done to forfeit it  But  sure  you        cannot think of abandoning me   of leaving me to all the horrors of        despair and shame   No  it is impossible  Ingratitude consists not        with that strict honour you pretend to  and that  I still flatter        myself  you are in reality possessed of  You may have had some        business  but how poor a thing is business when compared with love         And I may reply  with our English Sappho  in one of her amorous        epistles                  Business you feign  but did you love like me             I should your most important business be             But whither does my hurrying spirits transport me  If I am still so        happy to retain any share of your heart  I have said too much  if I        am not  all I can say will be ineffectual to move you  I shall         therefore  only tell you that I can live no longer without seeing        you  and will call on you at the coffee house this evening about        eight  till when I am  though in the utmost distraction  my dear         dear Trueworth  your passionately tender  and devoted servant            F  MELLASIN            P S  Having heard you say letters were left for you at this place         and that you stepped in once or twice every day  I thought it more        proper to direct for you here than at your own lodgings  Once more        adieu   Do not fail to meet me at the hour        Scarce could the ghost of a forsaken mistress  drawing his curtains at   the dead of night  have shocked Mr  Trueworth more than this epistle  He   had  indeed  done no more than any man of his age and constitution would   have done  if tempted in the manner he had been  yet he reproached   himself severely for it  He knew how little this unhappy creature had   her passions in subjection  and  though all the liking he ever had for   her was now swallowed up in his honourable affections for Miss Harriot    yet he was too humane and too generous not to pity the extravagance of a   flame he was no longer capable of returning  He wanted her to know there   was a necessity for their parting  but knew not how to do it without   driving her to extremes  He hated all kind of dissimulation  and  as   neither his honour nor his inclinations would permit him to continue an   amorous correspondence with her  he was very much at a loss how to put   an end to it  without letting her into the real cause  which  as yet    he thought highly improper to do       It cost him some time in debating within himself how he should behave in   an affair which was  indeed  in the present situation of his heart    pretty perplexing  he considered Miss Flora as a woman of condition  as   one who tenderly loved him  and as one who  on both these accounts  it   would not become him to affront  He reflected also  that a woman  who   had broke through all the rules of virtue  modesty  and even common   decency  for the gratification of her wild desires  might  when denied   that gratification  be capable of taking such steps as might not only   expose her own character  but with it so much of his as might ruin him   with Miss Harriot  He found it  therefore  highly necessary to disguise   his sentiments  and
