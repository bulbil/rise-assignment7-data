were she and Father Marescotti  who had acquainted them with what had passed between her  himself  and me   The Bishop arose  and embraced me—Dear Grandison  said he  how I admire you —Why  why will Page  30 you not let me call you brother —Were a prince your competitor  and you would be a Catholic—  O that you would  said the Marchioness  her hands and eyes lifted up   And will you not  Can you not  said the Count   That  my Lord  is a question kindly put  as it shews your regard for me—But it is not to be answered now   The Marquis took my hand  He applauded the disinterestedness of my behaviour to his family  He approved of my proposal of absence  but said  that I must myself undertake to manage that part  not only with their Clementina  but with Jeronymo  whose grateful heart would otherwise be uneasy  on a surmise  that the motion came not from myself  but them   We will not rosolve upon any measures  said he  God continue and improve our prospects  and the result we will leave to his providence   I went from them directly to Jeronymo  and told him my intention of setting out for Rome and Naples  in discharge of my promise to the General and his Lady   He asked me  What would become of Clementina in the mean time  Was there not too great a danger that she would go back again   I told him I would not go  but with her approbation  I pleaded my last absence of ten days  in favour of my intention  Her recovery  said I  must be a work of time  If I am of the consequence your friendship for me supposes  her attention will  probably  be more engaged by short absences  and the expectations raised by them  than by daily visits  I remember not  my dear Jeronymo  continued I  a single instance  that could induce any one to imagine  that your Clementina s regard for the man you favour was a personal one  Friendship never lighted up a purer flame in a human heart  than in that of your sister  Was not the future happiness of the man she esteemed  Page  31 the constant  I may say  the only object of her cares  In the height of her malady  Did she not declare  that were that great article but probably secured  she would resign her life with pleasure   True  very true  Clementina is an excellent creature  She ever was  And you only can deserve her  O that she could be now worthy of you  But are my father  mother  brother  willing to part with you  Do they not  for Clementina s sake  make Objections   The last absence fitting so easy on her mind  they doubt not but frequent absences may excite her attention   Well  well  I acquiesce  The General and his Lady will rejoice to see you  I must not be too selfish  God preserve you  where ever you go —Only let not the gentle heart of Clementina be wounded by your absence  Don t let her miss you   To morrow  replied I  I will consult her  She shall determine for me   LETTER V  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  In Continuation   June 14 25   HAVING the honour of an invitation to a conversation visit  to the Cardinal Legate  and to meet there the Gonfalonier  I went to the palace of Porretta in the morning   After sitting about half an hour with my friend Jeronymo  I was admitted to the presence of Lady Clementina  Her father  mother  and the Bishop  were with her  Clementina  Chevalier  said her mother  was enquiring for you  She is desirous to recover her English  Are you willing  Sir  to undertake your pupil again   Ay  Chevalier  said the young Lady  those were Page  32 happy times  and I want to recover them  I want to be as happy as I was then   You have not been very well  madam  And is it not better to defer our lectures for some days  till you are quite established in your health   Why  that is the thing  I know I have been very ill  I know that I am not yet quite well  and I want to be so  And that is the reason that I would recover my English   You will soon recover it  madam  when you begin  But at present  the thought  the memory  it would require you to exert  would perplex you  I am afraid the study would rather retard  than forward your recovery   Why  now  I did not expect this from you  Sir  My mamma has consented   I did  my dear  because I would deny you nothing  that your heart was set upon  But the Chevalier has given you such good reasons to suspend his lectures  that I wish you would not be earnest in your request   But I can t help it  madam  I want to be happy   Well  madam
