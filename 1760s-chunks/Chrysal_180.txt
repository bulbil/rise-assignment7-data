for ostentation  Adieu    my friend  Heaven guard you in the day of battle  and guide your   sword to victory        I here quitted the service of this great man   the instances of   whose conduct  which I have given  make any further character of   him unnecessary      The regard with which the minister had addressed himself to my   present master raised my curiosity to take aa immediate view of   his heart  as I knew not but that I might leave his possession directly    But my fears were agreeably disappointed  for the number of guineas   given to him by my master exceeding that of the objects to whom   we were to be distributed  it fell to my lot to remain a little longer   with him      The honour of his new command  and the confidence with which it   was entrusted to him  warmed his heart with the most exalted joy    He executed his charitable commission  and then went directly home    where  bending his knee to his beloved mother  and kissing her hand   in rapture â€”   Oh  madam    said he    congratulate your happy son    My prayers at length are heard  and I am blessed with an oppor    tunity of proving to the world my attachment to the service  my   ardour for the glory of my country  I am honoured with the   separate command in America  where Heaven fires my soul with an   assurance that I shall have the happiness of crushing the injurious   power of our enemies in the very place where it first attacked my   country  where it has too long triumphed in its wrongs          Heaven bless my son    replied the matron  as soon as a gush of   tears of joy and tenderness permitted her to speak    Heaven guard   my son  and bless his pious hopes  Let me only live to see him   return with the honour of having done his duty  and I shall die   contented  But why do I say this  as if my heart felt a doubt for   him   My son will never fail to do his duty   he will never fall   from the paths of honour  however dangerous  nor seek to colour   over with specious arguments the loss of his honour  He will not   make his mother ashamed of having borne him  nor bring her grey   hairs with disgrace and sorrow to the grave  I know the instruc    tions which have formed his youth   I know the principles of his   heart   I know my own blood better  But oh  my son   remember   also that prudence distinguishes true courage from rashness    that your country has now a peculiar interest in your life  and that   you betray its trust  if you lose it by any unnecessary boldness    Remember your aged mother  who hangs weeping over her grave   till you return  Remember your         Oh  my mother  no more   Recall not ideas winch my present         200 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     situation requires me to forget  Fear not  your son Tvill not be a   disgrace to the honest race from which he has sprung  He will do   his duty as a soldier  a British soldier  and as a man sensible of the   obligations of reason and religion  Whether I shall ever have the   happiness of kissing this hand again  is only known to Heaven     but it is in my power to promise that the name of your son shall   never raise a blush in the face of his mother  nor his actions require   the palliation of excuse from his friends  If life is to be short    let it be well filled   one day of glory is better than an age of idle    ness or dishonour  Adieu  my mother   your blessing is a shield   to the head  a support to the soul of your son   one tender parting   more  and then my heart must be resigned to other cares         Heaven bless  Heaven guard my son     and then  as he went   from her    O glory  what a tribute dost thou expect from wretched   mortals         My master paused a moment to wipe away the pious tear which   filial duty owed to such a parting  and then hasted to another scene   of equal tenderness      Mutual merit had improved the instinctive liking of youth between   my master and a young lady i whose elevated rank and large fortune   were her least recommendations  into the strongest attachment
