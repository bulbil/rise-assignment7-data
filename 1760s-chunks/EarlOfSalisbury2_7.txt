and although  she knows not by whom  or for what purpose  it may have been secreted   yet this incident hath awakened her suspicions  and she dreads some  farther design upon her peace  But chiefly she fears for her son  she  condemns her late conduct as weak and precipitate  and repents of  having trusted the boy from her side  At  first  she made an effort to preserve her dignity  and  in the language  of greatness and affected disdain  demanded how long my usurpation was  to be continued  I interrupted her with humble and ardent expressions  of love  she wept  and was still deaf to my sollicitations  Yet   methought  she spoke of her late Lord with less pride and exultation   If  said she  he hath indeed paid the debt of nature  may heaven look on  his offences with mercy  and protect his helpless infant  and injured  widow  then  with earnest and affecting accents she entreated me to  accept of all her wealth and magnificence  to indulge my wishes freely  with the rich inheritance of her lordly house  but not to pursue the  ruin of an helpless infant  to suffer his mother to follow him in peace   to hide her grief  and waste her few melancholy days in the holy  retirement of the monastery —O my friend  who could stand unmoved at her  disorder  But I did not suffer all my emotion to break out  I contented  myself  in general  with entreating her to banish all gloomy thoughts   to expect happy days  to study her real happiness  and to command it  I  then retired  impatiently expecting your arrival  and your sage and  friendly counsel         The success which had hitherto attended the practices and designs of  Grey  gave him authority and consequence with his Lord  and encouraged  him to urge his advice boldly and violently  When he had first informed  him in general of the transactions of the monastery  he prest him to  consider seriously that new incidents might arise  new dangers threaten  him  which might not always be prevented  He spoke with severity of his  irresolute and timid conduct  asked  if it was his purpose to abandon  all his glorious hopes  to return disgraced and rejected  to encounter  scorn and reproach  as a person unworthy of the regards of this Lady   presumptuous and unjust  Nothing could secure his honour from ruin  or  perhaps his life from revenge  but his immediate nuptials with the  Countess  Of this he spoke  as of an event absolutely in the  power of Raymond  and delayed only by his mistaken tenderness  He was  heard with earnest surprise  but when his Lord began to plead the  difficulties he had encountered  and the obstinacy of Ela in denying  her consent  he hastily interrupted him —  Let a day be appointed    cried this minion         for the celebration of your nuptials  let it be known through the land   let your attendants be ordered to prepare for this event  and your  knights directed to hold themselves in such readiness as the joyful  occasion requires —Let the rest be my care         Raymond  who still preserved a tender affection for the Countess  and  remembered with horror how dangerously she had been affected by the  insolence of Grey  hesitated  and insisted on a full explanation of this  mysterious language  Grey again urged the absolute necessity of  prevailing in his present undertaking  both for his honour and his  safety  the eternal infamy  nay  the utter impossibility of receding   after having already proceeded thus far  To this he added some artful  praises of the Countess  and many animated observations on the  happiness of that man who should possess such a treasure of beauty   When the passions of his Lord had by such discourse been raised to the  utmost degree of fervour  he began to flatter his hopes   This Lady    said he       you at first found reluctant  and no wonder  for she had not been  assured that Lord William was really no more  Of this she now seems  persuaded  but regards his death as an event too recent  to admit  another wooer  What though she hath discovered such impatience of your  love  what though she hath attempted to escape from this place  would  she not have persevered in her design  would she not have continued her  flight  if this reluctance and aversion had not been artfully assumed to  give her honour and respect in the general eye  She affects to summon  friends to rescue her from your power  but she hopes that they will  interpose  and persuade her to accept your hand  but do we delay  till  some new suiter shall arrive  and  under the pretence of relieving the  oppressed  and  revenging her wrongs  shall successfully court her love  and build his  own fortune on your disgrace and ruin
