he had received from our  adventurer  Had he known the young gentleman s talents for declamation  were so acute  perhaps he would never have given him cause to complain   but employed him in the vindication of his own measures  nay  he might  still have treated him like some other authors whom he had brought over  from the opposition  had not the keenness of this first assault  incensed him to a desire of revenge  He  therefore  no sooner made  this discovery  than he conveyed his directions to his dependent  the  receiver general  who was possessed of Pickle s notes  Next day  while  our author stood within a circle of his acquaintance  at a certain  coffee house  holding forth with great eloquence upon the diseases of  the state  he was accosted by a bailiff  who  entering the room with  five or six followers  told him aloud that he had a writ against him for  twelve hundred pounds  at the suit of Mr  Ravage Gleanum   The whole company were astonished at this address  which did not fail to  discompose the defendant himself  who  as it were instinctively  in the  midst of his confusion  saluted the officer across the head with  his cane  in consequence of which application  he was surrounded and  disarmed in an instant by the gang  who carried him off to the next  tavern in the most opprobrious manner  Nor did one of the spectators  interpose in his behalf  or visit him in his confinement with the  least tender of advice or assistance  such is the zeal of coffee house  friendship  This stroke was the more severe upon our hero  as it was  altogether unexpected  for he had utterly forgot the debt for which  he was arrested  His present indignation was  however  chiefly kindled  against the bailiff  who had done his office in such a disrespectful  manner  and the first use he made of his recollection in the house to  which they conducted him  was to chastise him for the insolence and  indecency of his behaviour  This task he performed with his bare fists   every other weapon being previously conveyed out of his reach  and  the delinquent underwent his discipline with surprising patience and  resignation  asking pardon with great humility  and protesting before  God  that he had never willingly and wittingly used any gentleman with  ill manners  but had been commanded to arrest our adventurer according  to the express direction of the creditor  on pain of forfeiting his  place   By this declaration Peregrine was appeased  and  out of a delirium of  passion  waked to all the horrors of reflection  All the glory of his  youth was now eclipsed  all the blossoms of his hope were blasted   and he saw himself doomed to the miseries of a jail  without the least    6 22 15  3 45 PM   prospect of enlargement  except in the issue of his lawsuit  of which he  had  for some time past  grown less and less confident every day  What  would become of the unfortunate  if the constitution of the mind did  not permit them to bring one passion into the field against another   passions that operate in the human breast  like poisons of a different  nature  extinguishing each other s effect  Our hero s grief reigned in  full despotism  until it was deposed by revenge  during the predominancy  of which he considered everything which had happened as a circumstance  conducive to its gratification   If I must be prisoner for life   said  he to himself   if I must relinquish all my gay expectations  let me at  least have the satisfaction of clanking my chains so as to interrupt  the repose of my adversary  and let me search in my own breast for that  peace and contentment  which I have not been able to find in all the  scenes of my success  In being detached from the world  I shall be  delivered from folly and ingratitude  as well as exempted from  an expense  which I should have found it very difficult  if not  impracticable  to support  I shall have little or no temptation  to misspend my time  and more undisturbed opportunity to earn my  subsistence  and prosecute revenge  After all  a jail is the best tub to  which a cynic philosopher can retire    In consequence of these comfortable reflections  he sent a letter to Mr   Crabtree  with an account of his misfortune  signifying his resolution  to move himself immediately into the Fleet  and desiring that he would  send him some understanding attorney of his acquaintance  who would  direct him into the steps necessary to be taken for that purpose  The  misanthrope  upon the receipt of this intimation  sent in person to a  lawyer  whom he accompanied to the spunging house whither the prisoner  had by this time retired  Peregrine was  under the auspices of his  director  conducted to the judges  chamber  where he was left in the  custody of a tipstaff  and  after having paid for
