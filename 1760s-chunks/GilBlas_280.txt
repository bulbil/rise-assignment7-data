for the best surgical assistance in the place   All the world was merciful  and wished me well  especially Donna Helena  whose heart was now unmasked  Her forced severity yielded to her natural feelings  Would you believe it  The cold  relentless  insensible  was kindled into the warmest of love s votaries  She wore out the remainder of the night in weeping with her faithful confidante  and giving her cousin  Don Austin de Olighera  to perdition  for him they taxed with the plotted massacre  and the bill was a true one  He could hide his heart as well as his cousin  he therefore watched my motions  without seeming to suspect them  and fancying them not to be without a corresponding impulse  he resolved not to be sacrificed with impunity  The accident was an awkward one to me  but it ended in overpowering rapture  Dangerous as my wound was  the surgeons soon brought me about  I was still confined to my chamber  when my aunt  Donna Eleonora  went over to Don George  and made proposals for Donna Helena  He consented the more readily to the marriage  as he never expected to see Don Austin again  The good old man was afraid of his daughter s not liking me  because cousin Olighera had kept her company  but she was so tractable to the parental behest  as to furnish grounds for believing that in Spain  as in other countries  the species  not the individual  is the object with the sex   Felicia  at our first private meeting  communicated the emotions of her mistress on my misfortune  Now  like another Paris  I thought Troy well lost for my Helen  and blessed the happy consequences of my wound  Don George allowed me to speak with his daughter in presence of her attendant  What a heavenly interview  I begged and prayed the lady so earnestly to tell me whether her sufferance of my vows was forced upon her by her father  that she at length confessed her obedience to be in unison with her inclinations  After so delicious a declaration  my whole soul was given up to love and pleasurable gratifications  Our nuptials were to be graced by a magnificent procession of all the principal people in Coria and the neighbourhood   I gave a splendid party at my aunt s country house  in the suburbs on the side of Manroi  Don George  his daughter  the family  and friends on both sides were present  There was a concert of vocal and instrumental music  with a company of strolling players  to represent a comedy  In the middle of the festivities  some one whispered me that a man wanted to speak with me in the hall  I got up from table to go and see who it was  The stranger looked like a gentleman s servant  He put a letter into my hand  containing these words    If you have any sense of honour  as a knight of your order ought to have  you will not fail to attend to morrow morning in the plain of Manroi  There you will find an antagonist  ready to give you your revenge for his former attack upon your person  or  what he rather hopes and meditates  to spoil your connubial transports with Donna Helena    DON AUSTIN DE OLIGHERA    If love is a Spanish passion  revenge is the Spanish lunacy  Such a note as this was not to be read with composure  At the mere subscription of Don Austin  there kindled in my veins a fire  which almost made me forget the claims of hospitality  I was tempted to steal away from my company  and seek my antagonist on the instant  For fear of disturbing the merriment  however  I bridled in my rage  and said to the messenger  My friend  you may tell your employer that I shall meet him on the appointed spot at sun rise  and resume the contest with obstinacy equal to his own   After sending this answer  I resumed my seat at table with so composed a mien  that no creature had the least suspicion of what had occurred  During the rest of the day  I gave myself up to the pleasures of the festival  which ended not till midnight  The guests then returned to town  but I staid behind  under pretext of taking the air on the following morning  Instead of going to bed  I watched for the dawn with maddening impatience  With the first ray I got on horseback  and rode alone towards Manroi  On the plain was a horseman  riding up to me at full speed  I pushed forward  and we met half way  It was my rival  Knight  said he  superciliously  it is against my will that I meet you a second time on the same occasion  but you have brought your fate on yourself  After the adventure of the serenade  you ought to have waived your pretensions to Don George s daughter  or at least to have been assured that the support of them must cost you dearer than a single encounter  You are too much elated  answered I  with an advantage which is less owing  perhaps  to your superior skill  than to the darkness of the night  Remember  that victory
