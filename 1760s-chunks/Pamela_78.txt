put on the dissembler a little  I see  She took   my hand roughly  Come  get up  said she  and come in a doors   I ll   Jezebel you  I will so   Why  dear Mrs  Jewkes  said I   None of your   dears  and your coaxing  said she  why not Jezebel again   She was in   a fearful passion  I saw  and I was out of my wits  Thought I  I   have often heard women blamed for their tongues  I wish mine had been   shorter  But I can t go in  said I  indeed I can t   Why  said she    can t you  I ll warrant I can take such a thin body as you under my arm    and carry you in  if you won t walk  You don t know my strength   Yes    but I do  said I  too well  and will you not use me worse when I come   in   So I arose  and she muttered to herself all the way  She to be a   Jezebel with me  that had used me so well  and such like       When I came near the house  I said  sitting down upon a settle bench    Well  I will not go in  till you say you forgive me  Mrs  Jewkes   If   you will forgive my calling you that name  I will forgive your beating   me   She sat down by me  and seemed in a great pucker  and said  Well    come  I will forgive you for this time  and so kissed me  as a mark of   reconciliation   But pray  said I  tell me where I am to walk and go    and give me what liberty you can  and when I know the most you can   favour me with  you shall see I will be as content as I can  and not ask   you for more       Ay  said she  this is something like  I wish I could give you all the   liberty you desire  for you must think it is no pleasure to me to tie   you to my petticoat  as it were  and not let you stir without me   But   people that will do their duties  must have some trouble  and what I   do  is to serve as good a master  to be sure  as lives   Yes  said I  to   every body but me  He loves you too well  to be sure  returned she    and that s the reason  so you ought to bear it  I say  love  replied I    Come  said she  don t let the wench see you have been crying  nor tell   her any tales  for you won t tell them fairly  I am sure  and I ll send   her  and you shall take another walk in the garden  if you will  May be   it will get you a stomach to your dinner  for you don t eat enough   to keep life and soul together  You are beauty to the bone  added the   strange wretch  or you could not look so well as you do  with so little   stomach  so little rest  and so much pining and whining for nothing at   all  Well  thought I  say what thou wilt  so I can be rid of thy bad   tongue and company  and I hope to find some opportunity now to come at   my sunflower  But I walked the other way  to take that in my return  to   avoid suspicion       I forced my discourse to the maid  but it was all upon general things    for I find she is asked after every thing I say and do  When I came near   the place  as I had been devising  I said  Pray step to the gardener    and ask him to gather a sallad for me to dinner  She called out  Jacob    said I  He can t hear you so far off  and pray tell him  I should like   a cucumber too  if he has one  When she had stept about a bow shot from   me  I popt down  and whipt my fingers under the upper tile  and pulled   out a letter without direction  and thrust it in my bosom  trembling for   joy  She was with me  before I could well secure it  and I was in such   a taking that I feared I should discover myself  You seem frightened    madam  said she  Why  said I  with a lucky thought   alas  your poor   daughter will make an intriguer by and by  but I hope an innocent one
