to open and wear a more pleasing appearance  beautiful cascades  beds of flowers  trees loaded with fruit   130 or blossoms  and unexpected brooks  improved the scene  he now found that he was ascending  and  as he proceeded  all nature grew more beautiful  the prospect widened as he went higher  even the air itself seemed to become more pure  Thus pleased  and happy from unexpected beauties  I at last led him to an arbour  from whence he could view the garden and the whole country around  and where be might own  that the road to Virtue terminated in Happiness   Though from this description you may imagine  that a vast tract of ground was necessary to exhibit such a pleasing variety in  yet be assured  that I have seen several gardens in England take up ten times the space which mine did  without half the beauty  A very small extent of ground is enough for an elegant taste  the greater room is required if magnificence is in view  There is no spot  tho  ever so little  which a skilful designer might not thus improve  so as to convey a delicate allegory  and impress the mind with truths the most useful and necessary  Adieu   LETTER XXXI  From the same   IN a late excursion with my friend into the country  a gentleman with a blue ribbon tied round his shoulder  and in a chariot drawn by six horses passed swiftly by us  attended with a numerous train of captains  lacquies  and coaches filled with women  When we were recovered   131 from the dust raised by his cavalcade  and could continue our discourse without danger of suffocation  I observed to my companion  that all this state and equi which he seemed to despise  would in China be regarded with the utmost reverence  because such distinctions were always the reward of merit  the greatness of a Mandarine s retinue being a most certain mark of the superiority of his abilities or virtue   The gentleman who has now passed us  replied my companion  has no claims from his own merit to distinction  he is possessed neither of abilities nor virtue  it is enough for him that one of his ancestors was possessed of these qualities two hundred years before him  There was a time  indeed  when his family deserved their titles  but they are long since degenerated  and his ancestors for more than a century have been more and more solicitous to keep up the breed of their dogs and horses than that of their children  This very nobleman  simple as he seems  is descended from a race of statesmen and heroes  but unluckily his great grandfather marrying a cook maid  and she having a trifling passion for his lordship s groom  they some how crossed the strain  and produced an heir  who took after his mother in his great love to good eating  and his father in a violent affection for horse flesh  These passions have for some generations passed on from father to son  and are now become the characteristics of the family  his present lordship being equally remarkable for his kitchen and his stable   But such a nobleman  cried I  deserves our pity thus placed in so high a sphe•e of life  which   132 only the more exposes to contempt  A king may confer titles  but it is personal merit alone that insures respect  I suppose  added I  that such men who are so very unfit to fill up their dignity  are despised by their equals  neglected by their inferiors  and condemned to live among involuntary dependants in irksome solitude   You are still under a mistake  replied my companion  for though this nobleman is a stranger to generosity  though he takes twenty opportunities in a day of letting his guests know how much he despises them  though he is possessed neither of taste  wit  nor wisdom  though incapable of improving others by his conversation  and never known to enrich any by his bounty  yet for all this  his company is eagerly sought after  he is a lord  and that is as much as most people desire in a companion  Quality and title have such allurements  that hundreds are ready to give up all their own importance  to cringe  to flatter  to look little  and to pall every pleasure in constraint  merely to be among the great  though without the least hopes of improving their understanding or sharing their generosity  they might be happy among their equals  but those are despised for company  where they are despised in turn  You saw what a crowd of humble cousins  card ruined beaus  and captains on half pay  were willing to make up this great man s retinue down to his country seat  Not one of all these that could not lead a more comfortable life at home in their little lodging of three shillings a week  with their lukewarm dinner  served up between two pewter plates from a cook s shop  Yet poor devils  they are willing to undergo the impertinence and pride of their entertainer  merely   133 to be thought to live among the great  they are willing to pass the summer in bondage  though conscious they are taken down only to approve his lordship s taste upon every occasion
