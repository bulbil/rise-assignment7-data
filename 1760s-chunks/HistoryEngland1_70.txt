that Richmond was marching with his little army to London  he was resolved to meet him on the way  and end the pretensions of one  or the other  by a battle  Richmond  though very much inferior in number  was not less defirous of engaging  so that the two armies soon met at Bosworth field  to determine a dispute that had now  for more than thirty years  drained England of its bravest subjects   Richard  perceiving his enemy advance  drew up his army  consisting of about thirteen thousand men  in order of battle  he gave the command of   205 the van guard to the Duke of Norfolk  and led the main body himself  with the crown on his head  either designing by this to inspire the enemy with awe  or to render himself conspicuous to his own army  The Earl of Richmond  who had not half the number of men  drew up his forces also in two lines  the Earl of Oxford commanding the first  and he himself the second  Lord Stanley  in the mean time  posted himself in one flank between the two armies  and his brother took his station in the other  which was opposite  Richard  seeing him thus in a situation equally convenient for joining either army  immediately sent him orders to join him  which the other refusing  he gave instant command for beheading Lord Stanley s son  whom he had kept as an hostage  but  being persuaded to postpone the execution till after the fight  he complied  and immediately ordered the trumpets to sound to battle  The two armies approaching each other  the battle began with a shower of arrows  and soon the two ranks began to close  this was what Stanley expected  who immediately  profiting himself of the occasion  joined the line of Richmond  and turned the fortune of the day  In the mean while  Richard spurred up his horse into the thickest of the fight  and Richmond quitted his station behind  to encourage his troops  by his presence in the front  Richard  perceiving him  was willing to end all by one blow  and  with the fury of a lion  flew through thousands to attack him  He slew Sir William Brandon  the Earl s standard bearer  who had attempted to stop his career  Sir John Cheney  having taken Brandon s place  was thrown to the ground  Richmond  in the mean time  stood to oppose him  but  the crowd interposing    206 they were separated  Richard now  therefore  went to inspire his troops at another quarter  but  at last  perceiving his army every where yielding or flying  and now finding that all was gone  he rushed  with a loud shout  into the midst of the enemy  and there met a better death than his actions had merited  after the battle his body being found amidst an heap of slaughter  stripped naked  covered over with wounds  and the eyes frightfully staring  was thrown across an horse  the head hanging down on one side and the legs on the other  and so carried to Leicester  It lay there two days  exposed to public view  and then was buried without farther ceremony   Richard s crown  being found  by one of the soldiers  in the field of battle  was immediately placed upon the head of the conqueror  the whole army  as if inspired  with one voice  crying out  Long live King Henry  Thus ended the bloody reign of Richard  and  by his death the race of the Plantagenet Kings  that had been in possession of the crown during the space of three hundred and thirty years  became extinct  Thus ended also the contests between the houses of York and Lancaster  which had  for thirty years  been as a pestilence to the kingdom  and in which above an hundred thousand men lost their lives  either by the executioner  or on the field of battle   These dissensions had reduced the kingdom to a state of almost savage barbarity  laws  arts  and commerce were entirely neglected for the practice of arms  and to be a conqueror was sufficient  in the eyes of the people  to stand for every other virtue  They had  as yet  no idea of pacific government  nor could lend applause to those who cultivated it  and  except only in their gallantry   207 to the fair sex  they little differed from the ancient painted inhabitants of the island  In these wars the women  though never so formidable  or never so active  unless accused of witchcraft  were exempted from capital punishments  which probably proceeded from a spirit of gallantry  the single virtue of the times  As for the clergy  they were entirely distinct from the laity  both in customes  constitutions  and learning  they were governed by the civil law  drawn up by one of the Roman Emperors  whereas the laity were governed by the common law  which was traditionally delivered to them from their ancestors  The clergy  however you may be told to the contrary  understood and wrote Latin tolerably well  the laity  on the other hand  understood no Latin  but applied themselves wholly to French
