grow up to curse his old age  and bring his hoary head with sorrow to the grave  as he himself has proved a curse to me and mine    The rest of the prisoners  perceiving the knight extremely shocked at her misery and horrid imprecation  removed her by force from his presence  and conveyed her to another room  while our adventurer underwent a violent agitation  and could not for some minutes compose himself so well as to inquire into the nature of this wretched creature s calamity   The shopkeeper  of whom he demanded this satisfaction  gave him to understand that she was born a gentlewoman  and had been well educated  that she married a curate  who did not long survive his nuptials  and afterwards became the wife of one Oakley  a farmer in opulent circumstances  That after twenty years  cohabitation with her husband  he sustained such losses by the distemper among the cattle  as he could not repair  and that this reverse of fortune was supposed to have hastened his death  That the widow  being a woman of spirit  determined to keep up and manage the farm  with the assistance of an only son  a very promising youth  who was already contracted in marriage with the daughter of another wealthy farmer  Thus the mother had a prospect of retrieving the affairs of her family  when all her hopes were dashed and destroyed by a ridiculous pique which Mrs  Gobble conceived against the young farmer s sweetheart  Mrs  Susan Sedgemoor   This young woman chancing to be at a country assembly  where the gravedigger of the parish acted as master of the ceremonies  was called out to dance before Miss Gobble  who happened to be there present also with her mother  The circumstance was construed into an unpardonable affront by the justice s lady  who abused the director in the most opprobrious terms for his insolence and ill manners  and retiring in a storm of passion  vowed revenge against the saucy minx who had presumed to vie in gentility with Miss Gobble  The justice entered into her resentment  The gravedigger lost his place  and Suky s lover  young Oakley  was pressed for a soldier  Before his mother could take any steps for his discharge  he was hurried away to the East Indies  by the industry and contrivance of the justice  Poor Suky wept and pined until she fell into a consumption  The forlorn widow  being thus deprived of her son  was overwhelmed with grief to such a degree  that she could no longer manage her concerns  Everything went backwards  she ran in arrears with her landlord  and the prospect of bankruptcy aggravated her affliction  while it added to her incapacity  In the midst of these disastrous circumstances  news arrived that her son Greaves had lost his life in a sea engagement with the enemy  and these tidings almost instantly deprived her of reason  Then the landlord seized for his rent  and she was arrested at the suit of Justice Gobble  who had bought up one of her debts in order to distress her  and now pretended that her madness was feigned   When the name of Greaves was mentioned  our adventurer started and changed colour  and  now the story was ended  asked  with marks of eager emotion  if the name of the woman s first husband was not Wilford  When the prisoner answered in the affirmative  he rose up  and striking his breast   Good heaven   cried he   the very woman who watched over my infancy  and even nourished me with her milk  She was my mother s humble friend  Alas  poor Dorothy  how would your old mistress grieve to see her favourite in this miserable condition   While he pronounced these words  to the astonishment of the hearers  a tear stole softly down each cheek  Then he desired to know if the poor lunatic had any intervals of reason  and was given to understand that she was always quiet  and generally supposed to have the use of her senses  except when she was disturbed by some extraordinary noise  or when any person touched upon her misfortune  or mentioned the name of her oppressor  in all which cases she started out into extravagance and frenzy  They likewise imputed great part of the disorder to the want of quiet  proper food  and necessaries  with which she was but poorly supplied by the cold hand of chance charity  Our adventurer was exceedingly affected by the distress of this woman  whom he resolved to relieve  and in proportion as his commiseration was excited  his resentment rose against the miscreant  who seemed to have insinuated himself into the commission of the peace on purpose to harass and oppress his fellow creatures   Thus animated  he entered into consultation with Mr  Thomas Clarke concerning the steps he should take  first for their deliverance  and then for prosecuting and punishing the justice  In result of this conference  the knight called aloud for the jailor  and demanded to see a copy of his commitment  that he might know the cause of his imprisonment  and offer bail  or  in case that he should be refused  move for a writ of Habeas Corpus  The jailor told him the copy of the writ should be forthcoming  But after he had waited
