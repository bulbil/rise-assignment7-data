but  when they came to close fight  the Normans were hewn down by the English bills  which  of all weapons  inflicted the most terrible and ghastly wounds  William  endeavouring to pierce their ranks  assaulted them so often  and with such bravery  that he had three horses killed in the attempt  Perceiving that they still continued impenetrable  he now pretended to fly  this drew the English from their ranks  and he was instantly ready to take advantage of their disorder  Upon a signal given  the Normans returned to the charge with greater fury than before  broke the English troops  and pursued them to a rising ground  Harold now flew from rank to rank  though he had toiled all day  from morning till now near night fall  in the front of his Kentish men  yet still he continued  with unabated vigour  to renew the fight  and exhort his men by his voice and example  The day now again seemed to turn against the victors  and the Normans fell in great numbers  The fierceness and obstinacy of this memorable battle was often renewed by the courage of the leaders  wherever that of the soldiers began to slacken  Fortune  at length  determined a victory  that valour was unable to decide  Harold  making a furious onset at the head of his troops  was shot into the brains by an arrow  All the   58 courage of the English expired with their brave  but unfortunate  leader  He fell with his sword in his hand  fighting for his country  amidst the heaps of slain  so that the royal corpse could hardly  after the battle  be distinguished among the dead   This was the end of the Saxon monarchy in England  which had continued for more than six hundred years  Before the times of Alfred the Kings seemed totally immersed in ignorance  and  after him  taken up with combating superstition  or blindly obeying its dictates  As for the crown  it was rather bequeathed by its possessor to whom he thought proper  than transmitted by hereditary and natural succession  As for the laws and customs of this race  they brought in many of their own  and adopted several of the ancient Btitons and Romans  which they found in the country upon their invasion  They assumed the name of Kings  nay  some took the Greek appellation of Basileus  titles unknown in the country from whence they came  Their Earls were called Dukes  or Duces  a name borrowed from the Romans  and signifying Captains  The lower classes of people were bought and sold with the farms they cultivated  a custom first introduced by the conquerors of the world  and which subsists in some countries  where the Roman laws continue  to this day  Their canon laws also at that time were often mixed with their civil laws  and were equally coercive  but these canon laws had their origin from Rome  and the Priests and Monks  who drew them up  generally had their education there  We must not  therefore  ascribe all the laws and customs  which at that time prevailed over England  to a Saxon original  since they were    59 in some cases  derived from the Britons and Romans  But now all those customs and laws  of whatever original  were cast down into one common mass  and cemented by those of Norman institution  The whole face of obligation was changed  and new masters and new forms observed  The laws were improved  but the taste of the people for polite learning  arts  and philosophy  for more than four hundred years to come  were still to continue the same  It is  indeed  surprizing  that in such a variety of events  such innovations in manners  and such changes in government  true politeness never came to be cultivated  Perhaps the reason may be  that the people suffered themselves to be instructed only by the clergy  and the clergy have a certain standard of politeness which they never go beyond  and at which they were arrived at the time we are speaking of  A Monk of the tenth century  and a Monk of the eighteenth century  are equally enlightened with science  and equally fit to promote the arts of happiness  I am   Dear Charles   Your s most affectionately   c   LETTER X   Dear Charles   YOU now enter upon that part of the English history  which gives birth to our present happy constitution  Those laws  which are so much esteemed by the rest of Europe  those liberties  which are so dear to us at home  begin to dawn at this period  The English  hitherto almost unknown to the rest of the world  began  after this   60 revolution  to make a considerable figure in Europe  The variety of dispositions of several foreign countries  being imported here  blended into one common national character  and produced sentiments of courage  freedom  irresolution  and pride   Immediately after the victory at Hastings  in which  it is said  sixty thousand English were slain  the Conqueror marched towards London  He carried before him a standard which had been blessed by the Pope  and to this all the clergy quickly resorted  The Bishops
