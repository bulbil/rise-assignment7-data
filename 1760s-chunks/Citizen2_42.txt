and sate on the stool of discontent by day  Pious man  who could thus set an example of sorrow and decorum to our country  Pious country  where  if we do not grieve at the departure of our friends for their sakes  at least we are taught to regret them for our own   All is very different here  amazement all  What sort of a people am I got amongst  Fum  thou son of Fo  what sort of people am I got amongst  No crawling round the coffin  no dressing up in hempen bags  no lying on mats  or sitting on stools  Gentlemen here shall put on first mourning with as sprightly an air as if preparing for a birth night  and widows shall actually dress for another husband in their weeds for the former  The best jest of all is  that our merry mourners clap bits of muslin on their sleeves  and these are called weepers  Weeping muslin  alas  alas  very   128 sorrowful truly  These weepers then it seems are to bear the whole burthen of the distress   But I have had the strongest instance of this contrast  this tragi comical behaviour in distress upon a recent occasion  Their King  whose departure  though sudden  was not unexpected  died after a reign of many years  His age  and uncertain state of health  served in some measure to diminish the sorrow of his subjects  and their expectations from his successor seemed to balance their minds between uneasiness and satisfaction  But how ought they to have behaved on such an occasion  Surely  they ought rather to have endeavoured to testify their gratitude to their deceased friend  than to proclaim their hopes of the future  Sure even the Successor must suppose their love to wear the face of adulation  which so quickly changed the object  However  the very same day on which the old King died  they made rejoicing for the new   For my part  I have no conception of this new manner of mourning and rejoicing in a breath  of being merry and sad  of mixing a funeral procession with a jig and a bonfire  At least  it would have been just  that they who flattered the King while living for virtues which he had not  should lament him dead for those he really had   In this universal cause for national distress  as I had no interest myself  so it is but natural to suppose  I felt no real affliction  In all the losses of our friends  says an European philosopher  we first consider how much our own welfare is affected by their departure  and moderate our real grief just in   129 the same proportion  Now  as I had neither received nor expected to receive favours from Kings or their flatterers  as I had no acquaintance in particular with their late monarch  as I knew that the place of a King is soon supplied  and as the Chinese proverb has it  that though the world may sometimes want coblers to mend their shoes  there is no danger of its wanting Emperors to rule their kingdoms  from such considerations  I could bear the loss of a King with the most philosophic resignation  However  I thought it my duty at least to appear sorrowful  to put on a melancholy aspect  or to set my face by that of the people   The first company I came amongst after the news became general  was a set of jolly companions who were drinking prosperity to the ensuing reign  I entered the room with looks of despair  and even expected applause for the superlative misery of my countenance  Instead of that I was universally condemned by the company for a grimacing son of a whore  and desired to take away my penitential phyz to some other quarter  I now corrected my former mistake  and with the most sprightly air imaginable entered a company  where they were talking over the ceremonies of the approaching funeral  Here I sat for some time with an air of pert vivacity  when one of the chief mourners immediately observing my good humour  desired me  if I pleased to go and grin somewhere else  they wanted no disaffected scoundrels there  Leaving this company therefore  I was resolved to assume a look perfectly neutral  and have ever since been studying the fashionable air  something between jest and earnest  a complete virginity of face  uncontaminated with the smallest symptom of meaning     130But though grief be a very slight affair here  the mourning  my friend  is a very important concern  When an Emperor dies in China  the whole expence of the solemnities is defrayed from the royal coffers  When the great die here  Mandarines are ready enough to order mourning  but I do not see that they are so ready to pay for it  If they send me down from court the grey undress frock  or the black coat without pocket holes  I am willing enough to comply with their commands  and wear both  but  by the head of Confucius  to be obliged to wear black  and buy it into the bargain  is more than my tranquility of temper can bear  What  order me to wear mourning before they know whether I can buy it or no  Fum  thou son of Fo
