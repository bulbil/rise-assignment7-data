pieces  and that those who remained in her had perished  But  as I afterwards learned  the gunner  who had more sagacity than Crampley  observing that it was flood when we left her  and that she would possibly float at high water  made no noise about getting on shore  but continued on deck  in hopes of bringing her safe into some barbour  after the commander had deserted her  for which he expected  no doubt  to be handsomely rewarded —This he accordingly performed  and was promised great things by the admiralty for saving his Majesty s ship  but I never heard he reaped the fruits of his expectation —As for my own part  I directed my course towards a small cottage I perceived  and in the road picked up a sea man s old jacket  which I suppose the thief who dressed himself in my cloaths  had thrown away  this was a very comfortable acquisition to me  who was almost stiff with cold  I therefore put it on  and as my natural heat revived  my wounds  which had left off bleeding  burst out afresh  so that finding myself excessively exhausted  I was about to lie down in the fields  when I discovered a barn on my left hand  within a few yards of me  thither I made shift to stagger  and finding the door open  went in  but saw no body  upon which I threw myself upon a truss of straw  hoping to be soon relieved by some person or other —I had not lain here many minutes  when I saw a countryman come in with a pitch fork in his hand    9 which he was upon the point of thrusting into the straw that concealed me  and in all probability would have done my business  had I not uttered a dreadful groan  after having essayed in vain to speak —This melancholy note alarmed the clown  who started back  and discovering a body all besmeared with blood  stood trembling  with the pitch fork extended before him  his hair erect  his eyes staring  his nostrils dilated  and his mouth wide open —At another time  I should have been much diverted with this figure  which preserved the same attitude very near a quarter of an hour  during which time I made many unsuccessful efforts to implore his compassion and assistance  but my tongue failed me  and my language was only a repetition of groans  At length an old man arrived  who seeing the other in such a posture  cried     Mercy upon en  the leaad s bewitch d —why dick  beest thou besayd thyself  —  Dick  without moving his eyes from the object that terrified him  replied    O vather  vather  here be either the devil or a dead mon  I doan t know which o en  but a groans woundily  —  The father  whose eye sight was none of the best  pulled out his spectacles  and having applied them to his nose  reconnoitred me over his son s shoulder  But no sooner did he behold me  than he was seized with a fit of shaking  even more violent than Dick s  and with a broken accent addressed me thus    In the name of the Vather  Zun  and Holy Ghosty  I charge you an you been Satan to begone to the Red Zea  but an you be a moordered mon  speak  that you may have a christom burial  —  As I was not in a condition to satisfy him in this particular  he repeated his conjuration to no purpose    10 and they continued a good while in the agonies of fear —At length the father proposed  that the son should draw nearer and take a more distinct view of the apparition  but Dick was of opinion that his father should advance first  as being an old man past his labour  and if he received any mischief  the loss would be the smaller  whereas he himself might escape  and be useful in his generation —This prudential reason had no effect upon the senior  who still kept Dick between me and him —In the mean time I endeavoured to raise one hand as a signal of distress  but had only strength sufficient to cause a rustling among the straw  which discomposed the young peasant so much  that he sprung out at the door  and overthrew his father in his flight —The old gentleman would not spend time in getting up  but crawled backwards like a crab  with great speed  till he had got over the threshold  mumbling exorcisms all the way —I was exceedingly mortified to find myself in danger of perishing through the ignorance and cowardice of these clowns  and felt my spirits decay apace  when an old woman entered the barn  followed by the two fugitives  and with great intrepidity advanced to the place where I lay  saying    If it be the devil I fearen not  and for a dead mon a can do us no harm  —  When she saw my condition  she cried   Here be no devil  but in youren fool s head —Here be a poor miserable wretch  bleeding to death  and if he dies  we must be at the charge of burying him  therefore Dick  go
