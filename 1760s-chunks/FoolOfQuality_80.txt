wants of the company  The guests  all abashed and confounded   at what they saw  sat some time with open mouth and unswallowed   victuals   much less did they presume to apply to the waiters for   any article they wanted  till  being encouraged and spirited up by   the cheerfulness  ease  and readiness of their attendants  they be    came by degrees quite happy and jovial   and  after a saturating   meal and an enlivening cup  they departed with elevated spirits    with humanized manners  and with hearts warmed in affection   toward every member of this extraordinary house      By the means of this weekly bounty  these reviving families were   soon enabled to clear their little debts to the chandlers  which had   compelled them to take up every thing at the dearest hand  They   were also further enabled to purchase wheels and other implements    with the materials of flax and wool  for employing the late idle   hands of their household  They now appeared decently clad  and   with happy countenances   their wealth increased with their indus    try  and the product of the employment of so many late useless   members became a real accession of wealth to the public  So true   it is that the prosperity of this world  and of every nation and   society therein  depends solely on the industry or manufactures of   the individuals  And so much more nobly did this private patron   act than all ancient legislators  or modern patrons and landlords    whose selfishness  if they had but common cunning  or common    sense  might instruct them to increase their proper rents  and en    rich their native country  by supplying the hands of all the poor   within their influence with the implements and materials of the   prosperity of each      In the mean time  Mrs  Hannah daily instructed the children in   the reading of English   neither was Mr  Fenton inattentive to any   means that might preserve and promote the health  action  and         56 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      corporal excellences of his little champion  He had a large lawn   behind his garden   and hither he summoned  three times in every   week  all the boys of the vicinage who were between two years   advanced above the age of our hero  To these he appointed pre    miums for foot ball  hurling  wrestling  leaping  running  cudgelling    and buffing  But the champions were enjoined to invest their fists   with little mufflers  insomuch that  how great soever their vigour   might be  the bruises that they gave stopped short of mortality      Now  though these premiums were almost universally adjudged   to the party of which Harry then happened to be a member  or   individually to himself for his single prowess and pre eminence  yet   he never would consent to bear the prize from the field  but either   gave it to some favourite among those with whom he had been   associated  or to the particular champion whom he had worsted in   contest   for he felt the shame and defeat of his mortified adversary    and consolingly hinted at the injustice of the judges  and reformed   their error by the restoration of the reward      One day  while Harry was watching to intercept poor travellers    as eagerly as a fowler watches for the rising of his game  he heard   a plaintive voice behind the hedge  as he thought  in the opposite   field  He flew across the road  and  passing through a small turn    utile  soon found the unhappy objects he sought for  He stood for   some time like a statue  and his compassion became too strong for   tears or utterance  but  suddenly turning and flying back again    he rushed with precipitation into the room where Mr  Fenton was   writing a letter  What is the matter  said Mr  Fenton  starting   what has frighted you  my Harry what makes you so pale   To   this Harry replied not   but catching hold of his hand  and pulling   with all his force O come   says he   O come  dada  and see       Mr  Fenton then got up  and suffered himself to be led where   the child pleased to conduct him  without another word being   asked or answered on either side      When they were come into the field  Mr  Fenton observed a man   Bitting on the ground  His clothes seemed  from head to foot  as   the tattered remainder of better days  Through a squalid wig and   beard  his pale face appeared just tinctured with a faint and sickly   red
