made love to this antiquated coquette  who seemed extremely happy in her adorer  and spread all her allurements to make her imagined conquest more secure —The good woman of the house treated us with tea and sweet meats  and afterwards withdrew  like a civil experienced matron as she was —Left thus to our mutual endearments  Miss Withers  for she was still a maiden  began to talk of matrimony  and expressed so much impatience in all her behaviour  that  had she been fifty years younger  I might possibly have gratified her longing without having recourse to the church  but this my virtue as well as interest forbad  When the inclinations or an old maid settle upon a young fellow  he is persecuted with her addresses  but  should he once grant her the favour  he will never be able to disentangle himself from her importunities and reproaches  It was my business to defer the ceremony as long as possible under the most specious pretences  with a view of becoming acquainted with Miss Sparkle  in the mean time  and I did not despair of success  when I considered  that in the course of our correspondence I would  in all probability  be invited to visit my mistress in her own apartment  and by that means have an opportunity of conversing with   156 her charming ward  Pleased with this prospect  my heart dilated with joy  I talked in raptures to the stale gouvernante  and kissed her shriveled hand with great devotion  She was so much transported with her good fortune  that she could not contain her exstasy  but flew upon me like a tygeress  and pressed her skinny lips to mine  when  as it was no doubt concerted by her evil genius  a dose of garlick she had swallowed that morning  to dispel wind I suppose  began to operate with such a sudden explosion  that human nature  circumstanced as I was  could not endure the shock with any degree of temper —I lost all patience and reflection  flung away from her in an instant  snatched my hat and cane  and run down stairs as the devil had me in pursuit  and could scarce restrain the convulsion of my bowels  which were grievously offended by the persume that assaulted me —Strap  who waited my return with impatience  seeing me arrive in the utmost disorder  stood motionless with apprehension  and durst not enquire into the cause   After I had washed my mouth more than once  and recruited my spirits with a glass of wine  I recounted to him every particular of what had happened  to which he made no other reply  for some time  than lifting up his eyes  clasping his hands  and uttering a hollow groan —At length he observed  in a melancholy tone  that it was a thousand pities my organs were so delicate as to be offended with the smell of garlick     Ah  God help us  said he   tis not the steams of garlick  no  nor of something else  that would give me the least uneasiness—see what it is to be a cobler s son  —  I replied hastily    I wish then  you would go and retrieve   157 my miscarriage  —  At this he started  forced a smile  and left the room  shaking his head  Whether the old gentlewoman resented my abrupt departure so much  that her love changed into disdain  or was ashamed to see me on account of her infirmity  I know not  but I was never troubled again with her passion     CHAP  LI    I cultivate an acquaintance with two noblemen—am introduced to Earl Strutwell—his kind promise and invitation—the behaviour of his porter and lacquey—he receives me with an appearance of uncommon affection—undertakes to speak in my behalf to the minister—informs me of his success  and wishes me joy—introduces a conversation about Petronius Arbiter—falls in love with my watch  which I press upon him—I make a present of a diamond ring to lord Straddle—impart my good fortune to Strap and Banter  who dissabuses me  to my utter mortification   BAFFLED hitherto in my matrimonial schemes  I began to question my talents for the science of fortune hunting  and to bend my thoughts towards some employment under the government —With the view of procuring which  I cultivated the acquaintance of Lords   158 Straddle and Swillpot  whose fathers were men of interest at court —I found these young noblemen as open to my advances as I could desire  I accompanied them in their midnight rambles  and often dined with them at taverns  where I had the honour of paying the reckoning   I one day took the opportunity  while I was loaded with protestations of friendship  to disclose my desire of being settled in some sine cure  and to solicit their influence in my behalf —Swillpot squeezing my hand  said  I might depend upon his service  by G—d  The other swore that no man would be more proud than he to run my errands  Encouraged by these declarations I ventured to express an inclination to be introduced to their fathers  who were able to do my business at once  Swillpot frankly owned he had not spoke to his father these three years  and Straddle assured me his father having lately disobliged the Minister by subscribing his name to a protest
