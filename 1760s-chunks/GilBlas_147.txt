avoid the chastisement in store for you  you will give me your word to break off all connection with Leonora  Sacrifice in my favour all your hopes and interest  or your life must be the forfeit  It had been better  said I  to have ensured my generosity by good manners  than to extort my compliance by menaces  I might have granted to your request what I must refuse to this insolent demand   Well  then  resumed he  tying up his horse and preparing for the encounter  let us settle our dispute like men  Little could a person of my condition have stomached the debasement of a request  to a man of your quality  Nine out of ten in my rank would  under such circumstances  have taken their revenge on terms of less honour but more safety  I felt myself exasperated at this last insinuation  so that  seeing he had already drawn his sword  mine did not linger in the scabbard  We fell on one another with so much fury  that the engagement did not last long  Whether his attack was made with too much heat  or my skill in fencing was superior  he soon received a mortal wound  He staggered  and dropped dead upon the spot  In such a situation  having no alternative but an immediate escape  I mounted the horse of my antagonist  and went off in the direction of Toledo  There was no venturing to return to Baron Steinbach s  since  besides the danger of the attempt  the narrative of my adventure from my own mouth would only afflict him the more  so that nothing was so eligible as an immediate decampment from Madrid   Chewing the cud of my own melancholy reflection  I travelled onwards the remainder of the night and all the next morning  But about noon it became necessary to stop  both for the sake of my horse and to avoid the insupportable fierceness of the mid day heat  I staid in a village till sun set  and then  intending to reach Toledo without drawing bit  went on my way  I had already got two leagues beyond Ilescas  when  about midnight  a storm like that of to day overtook me as I was jogging along the road  There was a garden wall at some little distance  and I rode up to it  For want of any more commodious shelter  my horse s station and  my own were arranged  as comfortably as circumstances would admit  near the door of a summer house at the end of the wall  with a balcony over it  Leaning against the door  I discovered it to be open  owing  as I thought  to the negligence of the servants  Having dismounted  less from curiosity than for the sake of a better standing  as the rain had been very troublesome under the balcony  I went into the lower part of the summer  house  leading my horse by the bridle   My amusement during the storm was in reconnoitring my quarters  and though I had nothing to form an opinion by  but the lurid gleams of the lightning  it was very evident that such a house must belong to some family above the common  I was waiting anxiously till the rain abated  to set forward again on my journey  but a great light at a distance made me change my purpose  Leaving my horse in the summer house  with the precaution of fastening the door  I made for the light  in the assurance that they were not all gone to bed in the house  and with the intention of requesting a lodging for the night  After crossing several walks  I came to a saloon  and here too the door was left open  On my entrance  from the magnificence so handsomely displayed by the light of a fine crystal lustre  it was easy to conclude that this must be the residence of some illustrious nobleman  The pavement was of marble  the wainscot richly carved and gilt  the proportions of architecture tastefully preserved  and the ceiling evidently adorned by the masterpieces of the first artists in fresco  But what particularly engaged my attention was a great number of busts  and those of Spanish heroes  supported on jasper pedestals  and ranged round the saloon  There was opportunity enough for examining all this splendour  since there was not even a foot  fall  nor the shadow of any one gliding along the passage  though my ears and eyes were incessantly on the watch for some inhabitant of this fairy desert   On one side of the saloon there was a door a jar  by pushing it a little wider open  I discovered a range of apartments  with a light only in the furthest  What is to be done now  thought I within myself  Shall I go back  or take the liberty of marching forward  even to that chamber  To be sure  it was obvious that the most prudent step would be to make good my retreat  but curiosity was not to be repelled  or rather  to speak more truly  my star was in its ascendant  Advancing boldly from room to room  at length I reached that where the light was  It was a wax taper on a marble slab  in a magnificent candlestick  The first object that caught my
