divested of female softness  was in danger of becoming the public scorn  To this ratiocination  I added collateral arguments  always directed to the amendment of her manners  After having moralized to no purpose  I was afraid my freedom might exasperate my mistress  and draw upon me some taunting repartee  Nevertheless she did not mutiny against my advice  but silently rendered it of no avail  and thus we went on from day to day   I was weary of pointing out her errors to no purpose  and gave her up to the ferocious temperament of her nature  Yet  could you think it  the savage humour of that proud woman is entirely changed within these two months  She has a kind word for all the world  and manners the most accommodating  It is no longer the same Mergelina who gave such homely answers to the compliments of her swains  she is become assailable by flattery  loves to be told she is handsome  that a man cannot look at her without paying for it  her ears itch for fine speeches  and she is become a very woman  Such a change is almost inconceivable  and the best of the joke is  that you are the worker of this unparalleled miracle  Yes  my dear Diego  it is you who have transformed Donna Mergelina  you have softened down the tigress into a domestic animal  in a word  you have made her feel  I have observed it more than once  and never trust my knowledge of the sex  if she is not desperately in love with you  Such  my dear boy  is the melancholy news I have to communicate  the awkward predicament in which we stand   I do not see  said I in my turn to the old man  that there is anything so melancholy in this accident  or any peculiar awkwardness in being the object of a pretty woman s partiality  Ah  Diego  replied he  you argue like a young man  you only see the bait  without guarding against the hook  pleasure is your lure  while my thoughts are directed to the unpleasant circumstances attending it  Murder will out  If you go on singing at our door  you will provoke Mergelina s passion  and she probably  losing all command over herself  will betray her weakness to her husband  Doctor Oloroso  That wretched husband  so complying now that he thinks there is no ground for jealousy  will run wild  take signal vengeance upon her  and perhaps play some dog s trick or other to you and me  Well  then  rejoined I  your reasons shall be conclusive with me  and your sage counsels my rule  Lay down the line of conduct I am to adopt for the prevention of any left handed catastrophe  We will have no more concerts  was his peremptory decree  Do not show yourself any more to my mistress  when the sight of you does not inflame her  she will recover her composure  Stay within doors  I will call in upon you  and we will torture the guitar with impunity  With all my heart  said I  and I will never set my foot again in your premises  In good truth  I was determined to serenade no longer before the physician s door  but henceforth to keep within the precincts of my shop  since my attractions as a man were so formidable   In the mean time good Squire Marcos  with all his prudence  experienced in the course of a few days that the plan he had devised to quench Donna Mergelina s flame produced a directly opposite effect  The lady on the second night not hearing me sing  asked why we had discontinued our concerts  and the reason of my absence  He told her I was so busy as not to have a moment to spare for relaxation  She seemed satisfied with that excuse  and for three days longer bore the disappointment of all her hopes like a heroine  but at the end of that period  my martyr to the tender passion lost all patience  and said to her conductor     You are playing false with me  Marcos  Diego has not discontinued his visits without a cause  This mystery must be unravelled  Speak  I command you  conceal nothing from me  Madam  answered he  making use of another subterfuge  since the truth must be told  it has often happened to him to find the cloth taken away at home after the concert  he cannot run the risk any longer of going to bed without his supper  What  without his supper  exclaimed she in an agony  why did not you tell me so sooner  Go to bed without his supper  Oh  the poor little sufferer  Go to him this instant  and let him come again this evening  he shall not go home starving any more  there shall always be a luncheon for him   What do I hear  said the squire  affecting astonishment at this language  oh heaven  what a reverse  Is this you  madam  and are these your sentiments  Well a day  Since when are you so compassionate and tender hearted  Since  replied she significantly  since you have lived in this house  or rather since you disapproved my disdainful
