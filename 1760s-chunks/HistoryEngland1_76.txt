not avail themselves of the advantages of the security these afforded  they whose crimes were only fictitious  were the only people who had not the benefit of such a retreat  Henry used all his interest with the Pope to abolish these sanctuaries  but without effect  all that he could procure was  that  if thieves  murderers  or robbers  registered as sanctuary men  should sally out and commit fresh offences  and retreat again  in such cases they might be taken out of the sanctuary  and delivered up to justice   Henry politically pretended the utmost submission to all the Pope s decrees  and shewed the greatest respect to the clergy  but still was guided by them in no single instance of his conduct  The Pope  at one time  was so far imposed upon by his seeming attachment to the church  that he even invited him to renew the crusades for recovering the Holy Land  Henry s answer deserves to be remembered  He assured his Holiness  that no Prince in Christendom would be more forward than he to undertake so glorious and necessary an expedition  but  as his cominions lay very distant from Constantinople  it would be better to apply to the Kings of France and Spain for their assistance  and that  in the mean time  he would come to their aid himself    as soon as all the differences between the Christian Princes were brought to an end     223 This was  at once  a polite refusal and an oblique reproach     Henry had seen the fatal consequences of having favourites  and therefore resolved to have none  he even excluded  from his privy council  all such as  by their titles or fortune  might attempt to govern him instead of executing his intentions  His council was composed of private men  who had learning and wisdom to advise  but neither influence nor ambition to govern   But  while he was thus employed in lowering his nobility and clergy  he was using every art to extend the privileges of the people  In former reigns they were sure to suffer  on whatever side they fought  if they had the misfortune to lose the victory  this rendered each party desperate  in cases of civil war  and this was the cause of such terrible slaughters  He therefore procured the passing of an act  by which it was established  that no person should be impeached or attainted for assisting the King for the time being  or  in other words  him who should be then actually on the throne  This excellent statute served to repress the desire of civil war  as several would naturally take arms in defence of that side on which they were certain of losing nothing by a defeat  and their numbers  would intimidate insurgents   But his greatest efforts were directed to promote trade and commerce  because this naturally introduced a spirit of liberty among the people  and disengaged them from their dependence on the nobility  Before this happy aera  all our towns owed their original to some strong castle in the neighbourhood  where some great lord generally resided  and these also were made use of as prisons for all   224 sorts of criminals  In this also there was generally a garrison  or a number of armed men  who depended on the nobleman s bounty for support  The number of these  of course  drew all the artificers  victuallers  and shop keepers  to settle in some place adjacent  in order to furnish the lord and his attendants with what necessaries they wanted  The farmers also and husbandmen  in the neighbourhood  built their houses there  to be protected against the numerous gangs of robbers that hid in the woods by day  and infested the country by night  who were called Robertsmen  Henry  on the other hand  endeavoured to bring the towns from such a neighbourhood  by inviting the inhabitants to a more commercial situation  He attempted to teach them frugality and payment of debts  the life and soul of industry  by his own example  and never omitted the rights of commerce in all his treaties with foreign Princes   About this time the whole world seemed to improve  Sweden  France  and Spain  enjoyed excellent Monarchs  who encouraged and protected the rising arts  The Portuguese had sailed round the Cape of Good Hope  and Columbus had made the discovery of America  Henry  in imitation of them  gave a patent to some Bristol and Portuguese merchants to go in quest of new countries  But an accident gave him a better opportunity of improving commerce  than his most sanguine hopes could have aspired to  the King of Spain and his Queen  being upon their return to their own dominions  after the conclusion of a successful war in Holland  were driven  by a storm  upon the coasts of England  As soon as Henry had notice of their arrival  he received them both with marks of the sincerest friendship   225 and respect  meditating  in the mean time  how to make his subjects reap some advantage from the accident  He therefore treated them with a splendor which was by no means agreeable to his own nature  and  while he kept them thus entertained with a round of antry and amusements  he concluded a treaty of commerce
