suppose she lays it out in jewels  I love to see beauty adorned  and two thousand pounds  added to what you have given her  will set her on a footing in this respect with a nabobess       Your marriage  my dear Temple  removes the strongest objection to mine  the money I have in the funds  which whilst Lucy was unmarried I never would have taken  enables me to fix to great advantage here  I have now only to try whether Emily s friendship for me is sufficiently strong to give up all hopes of a return to England       I shall make an immediate trial  you shall know the event in a few days  If she refuses me  I bid adieu to all my schemes  and embark in the first ship       Give my kindest tenderest wishes to my mother and sister  My dear Temple  only know the value of the treasure you possess  and you must be happy  Adieu   Your affectionate  ED  RIVERS     LETTER C   100   To the Earl of —       My Lord   Silleri  March 24   NOTHING can be more just than your Lordship s observation  and I am the more pleased with it  as it coincides with what I had the honor of saying to you in my last  in regard to the impropriety  the cruelty  I had almost said the injustice  of your intention of deserting that world of which you are at once the ornament and the example       Good people  as your Lordship observes  are generally too retired and abstracted to let their example be of much service to the world  whereas the bad  on the contrary  are conspicuous to all  they stand forth  they appear on the fore ground of the picture  and force themselves into observation        Tis to that circumstance  I am persuaded  we may attribute that dangerous and too common mistake  that vice is natural to the human heart  and virtuous characters the creatures of fancy  a mistake of the most fatal tendency  as it tends to harden our hearts  and destroy that mutual confidence so necessary to keep the bands of society from loosening  and without which man is the most ferocious of all beasts of prey       Would all those whose virtues like your Lordship s are adorned by politeness and knowledge of the world  mix more in society  we should soon see vice hide her head  would all the good appear in full view  they would  I am convinced  be found infinitely the majority       Virtue is too lovely to be hid in cells  the world is her scene of action  she is soft  gentle  indulgent  let her appear then in her own form  and she must charm  let politeness be for ever her attendant  that politeness which can give graces even to vice itself  which makes superiority easy  removes the sense of inferiority  and adds to every one s enjoyment both of himself and others       I am interrupted  and must postpone till to morrow what I have further to say to your Lordship  I have the honor to be  my Lord    Your Lordship s   c   W  FERMOR     LETTER CI   101   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   Silleri  March 25   YOUR brother  my dear Lucy  has made me happy in communicating to me the account he has received of your marriage  I know Temple  he is  besides being very handsome  a fine  sprightly  agreable fellow  and is particularly formed to keep a woman s mind in that kind of play  that gentle agitation  which will for ever secure her affection       He has in my opinion just as much coquetry as is necessary to prevent marriage from degenerating into that sleepy kind of existence  which to minds of the awakened turn of yours and mine would be insupportable       He has also a fine fortune  which I hold to be a pretty enough ingredient in marriage       In short  he is just such a man  upon the whole  as I should have chose for myself       Make my congratulations to the dear man  and tell him  if he is not the happiest man in the world  he will forfeit all his pretensions to taste  and if he does not make you the happiest woman  he forfeits all title to my favor  as well as to the favor of the whole sex       I meant to say something civil  but  to tell you the truth  I am not en train  I am excessively out of humor  Fitzgerald has not been here of several days  but spends his whole time in gallanting Madame La Brosse  a woman to whom he knows I have an aversion  and who has nothing but a tolerable complexion and a modest assurance to recommend her       I certainly gave him some provocation  but this is too much  however   tis very well  I don t think I shall break my heart  though my vanity is a little piqued  I may perhaps live to take my revenge
