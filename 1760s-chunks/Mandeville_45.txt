and accountable to nobody  I have ever lived with Colonel Bellville  with the reserve of blushing apprehensive fifteen  whilst the warmth of my friendship for him  and the pleasure I found in his conversation  have let loose the baleful tongue of envy  and subjected me resolution to the malice of an ill judging world  a world I despise for his sake  a world  whose applause is too often bestowed on the cold  the selfish  and the artful  and denied to that generous unsuspected openness and warmth of heart  which are the strongest characteristicks of true virtue  My friendship  or  if you please  my love  for Colonel Bellville  is the first pleasure of my life  the happiest hours of which have been past in his conversation  nor is there any thing I would not sacrifise to my passion for him  but his happiness  which  for reasons unknown to your Ladyship  is incompatible with his marrying me          1 234          But is it not possible to remove those reasons        I am afraid not        Would it not then  my dear Madam  be most prudent to break off a connexion  which can answer no purpose but making both unhappy        I own it would  but prudence was never a part of my character  Will you forgive and pity me  Lady Belmont  when I say  that  though I see in the strongest light my own indiscretion  I am not enough mistress of my heart to break with the man to whom I have only a very precarious and distant hope of being united  There is an enchantment in his friendship  which I have not force of mind to break through  he is my guide  my guardian  protector  friend  the only man I ever loved  the man to whom the last recesses of my heart are open  must I give up the tender  exquisite           1 235       refined delight of his conversation  to the false opinion of a world  governed by prejudice  judging by the exterior  which is generally fallacious  and condemning  without distinction  those soft affections without which life is scarcely above vegetation      Do not imagine  my dear Lady Belmont  I have really the levity I affect  or  had my prejudices against marriage been ever so strong  the time I have passed here would have removed them  I see my Lord and you  after an union of thirty years  with as keen a relish for each other s conversation as you could have felt at the moment which first joined you  I see in you all the attention  the tender solicitude of beginning love  with the calm delight and perfect confidence of habitual friendship  I am  therefore  convinced marriage is capable of happiness  to which an unconnected state is lifeless and insipid  and  from observing the lovely delicacy of your Ladyship s conduct          1 236       I am instructed how that happiness is to be secured  I am instructed how to avoid that tasteless  languid  unimpassioned hour  so fatal to love and friendship      With the man to whom I was a victim  my life was one continued scene of misery  to a sensible mind  there is no cold medium in marriage  its sorrows  like its pleasures  are exquisite  Relieved from those galling chains  I have met with a heart suitable to my own  born with the same sensibility  the same peculiar turn of thinking  pleased with the same pleasures  and exactly formed to make me happy  I will believe this similarity was not given to condemn us both to wretchedness  as it is impossible either of us can be happy but with the other  I will hope the bar  which at present seems invincible  may be removed  till then indulge me  my dear Lady Belmont  in the innocent pleasure of loving him  and trust to his honor for the safety of mine             1 237          The most candid and amiable of women  after a gentle remonstrance on the importance of reputation to happiness  left me  so perfectly satisfied  that she intends to invite Bellville down  I send you this conversation as an introduction to a request I have to make you  which I must postpone to my next  Heavens  how perverse  interrupted by one of the veriest cats in nature  who will not leave us till ages after the post is gone  Adieu  for the present  it is prettily enough contrived  and one of the great advantages of society  that one s time  the most precious of all possessions  is to be sacrifised  from a false politeness  to every idle creature who knows not what else to do  Every body complains of this  but nobody attempts to remedy it        Am not I the most inhuman of women
