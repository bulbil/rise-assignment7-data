spare the implements   of their innocent recreation  The knight  surprised and charmed   by the vision  replied Fair creatures   my province is to protect    not to injure   to seek all means of service  but never of offence    more especially to any of your sex and apparent excellences  Your   pretty nets take up but a small piece of favoured ground   but did   they enclose the world  I would seek out new worlds whereby I   might win a passage rather than break them          160 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      Two very lovely but shame faced girls had a cause of some   consequence depending at Westminster  that indispensably required   their personal appearance  They were relations of Sir Joseph   Jekyl  and on this tremendous occasion requested liis company   and countenance at the court  Sir Joseph attended accordingly     and the cause being opened  the judge demanded whether he was   to entitle these ladies by the denomination of spinsters  No  my   lord  said Sir Joseph  they are lilies of the valley   they toil not    neither do they spin   yet you see that no monarch  in all his glory    was ever arrayed like one of these      Another very peculiar characteristic of a gentleman is the giving   place  and yielding to all with whom he has to do      Of this we have a shining and affecting instance in Abraham    perhaps the most accomplished character that may be found in   history  whether sacred or profane      A contention had arisen between the herdsmen of Abraham and   the herdsmen of his nephew  Lot  respecting the propriety of the   pasture of the lands wherein they dwelt  that could now scarce   contain the abundance of their cattle   and those servants  as is   universally the case  had respectively endeavoured to kindle and   inflame their masters with their own passions      When Abraham  in consequence of this  perceived that the   countenance of Lot began to change toward him  he called  and   generously expostulated with him as followeth       Let there be no strife  I pray thee  between me and thee  or   between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen  for we be brethren    If it be thy desire to separate thyself from me  is not the whole   land before thee   if thou wilt take the left hand  then I will go   to the right   or if thou depart to the right hand  then I will go to   the left       Another capital quality of the true gentleman is  that of feeling   himself concerned and interested in others  Never was there so   benevolent  so affecting  so pathetic a piece of oratory exhibited   upon earth  as that of Abraham s pleading with God for averting   the judgments that then impended over Sodom  But the matter   is already so generally celebrated  that I am constrained to refer   my reader to the passage at full   since the smallest abridgment   must deduct from its beauties  and that nothing can be adued to   the excellences thereof      Honour  again  is said in scripture peculiarly to distinguish the   character of a gentleman   where it is written of Shechem  the son   of Hamor    That he was more honourable than all the house of   his father       This young prince  giving way to the violence of his passion  had   dishonourably deflowered Dinah  the daughter of Jacob  But his   affections and soul cleaved to the party whom he had injured    He set no limits to his offers for repairing the wrong    Ask me     he said to her kindred    ask me never so much dowry and gift    and I will give according as ye shall say unto me   but give me   the damsel to wife       From hence it may be inferred  that human excellence or human   amiableness doth not so much consist in a freedom from frailty  as in         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  161     our recovery from lapses  our detestation of our own transgressions    and our desire of atoning by all possible means for the injuries   we have done  and the offences we have given  Herein  therefore    may consist the very singular distinction which the great apostle   makes between his estimation of a just and of a good man  For   a just or righteous man  says he    one would grudge to die   but   for a good man  one would even dare to die   Here the just man is
