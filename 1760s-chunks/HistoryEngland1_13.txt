it meritorious  though joined in wedlock  to continue in virginity  and some  for this erroneous practice  after their death were canonized as saints   At this period  namely  the seventh century  the arts and sciences  which had been before only known in Greece and Rome  were disseminated over Europe  where they sufficed  indeed  to raise the people above natural and savage barbarity  but then they lost their own splendor by the transplantation  The English  at the time I am now speaking   37 of  might be considered as polite  if compared to the naked Britons at the invasion of Caesar  The houses  furniture  cloaths  meetings  and all the luxuries of sense  were almost as great then as they are at present  they were only incapable of sentimental pleasure  all the learning of the times was consigned to the clergy  and little could be expected from their efforts  since their principal tenet was to discard the lights of reason  An eclipse was  even by their historians  talked of as a dangerous omen of threatened distresses  and magic was not only believed possible  but  what is more strange  there were some who even fancied they understood magic  In short  this whole period was tissued over with ignorance  cruelty  and superstition  and the kingdom seemed united under one Monarch  only the more readily to admit a new invader   I am   c   LETTER VII   IT might have reasonably been expected  that a fortunate prince as Ecbert had always been  at the head of so large an united kingdom  after the expulsion of the Picts  Scots  and Britons  should not only have enjoyed the fruits of peace  but even have left tranquility and happiness to his most distant posterity  Yet  such is the instability of human affairs  and the weakness of man s best conjecture  that Ecbert was scarcely settled in his throne  when the whole kingdom was alarmed by the approach of an unexpected enemy  fierce  barbarous  and brave  About this time a mighty swarm of those nations which had possessed the countries bordering the Baltic  began  under the   38 names of Danes and Normans  to infest the western coasts of Europe  filling the coasts wherever they came with slaughter and devastation  It is remarkable enough  that the people whom they spoiled were no other than colonies of their own countrymen  who had emigrated some centuries before  and plundered those very countries  where they were now themselves plundered in turn  The Normans fell upon the northern coasts of France  The Danes chiefly levelled their fury at England  and  entering the Thames with an incredible number of ships  carried away all that could neither be defended nor withdrawn from the suddenness of the invasion   The weak opposition the Danes met with from the English  only served to invite them to renew their depredations  and make fresh attempts the succeeding season  The bravest blood of the English had been already exhausted in civil war  under the dissensions of the Saxon heptarchy  and  when those wars were terminated  pilgrimages  penances  cloisters  and superstitions  served to enfeeble the remainder  Thus the Saxons were become as unequal to make opposition against the Danes  as the Britons were to oppose the Saxons heretofore  They therefore bought off their invaders with money  a remarkable instance how much they had degenerated from their warlike ancestors  The money which was thus extorted  only increased the avarice and the strength of the enemy  It was also raised by the Kings  from exactions on the people  this caused new discontent  and served to hasten the fall of their thrones  which already began to totter   This century  however  did not pass without various success  and doubtful fortune  between the two contending nations  No less than twelve   39 battles are said to have been fought in one year  The Danes divided their forces into several camps  removed them from one part of the country to another  as they were forced by necessity  invited by hopes of spoil  or induced by the weakness and divisions of the enemy  They fortified posts and passages  built castles for the defence of their borders  and the whole country was  in some measure  covered with their redoubts  the vestiges of which remain to this day  This manner of fortifying the country  and the difference of religion  seem to be the only customs in which the Danes differed from the Saxons they had invaded  They were both originally from the same country  and their manners consequently the same   The similitude of language  laws  and manners  soon produced an intercourse between both nations  and  though they still were enemies  the Danes gradually began to mingle among the people of England  and submit to the laws and kings of the country they had partly subdued  But what concord could be expected between Christians  as the English then were  and Pagans  for such the Danes still continued  Wherefore  tho  the English  in some measure  admitted the Danes  yet  still  they hated them  this produced frequent contests  which most frequently laid the country in blood   In this period of cruelty  jealousy
