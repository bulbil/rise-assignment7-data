me a blow on the face  which I verily thought had demolished my cheekbone  I was not slow in returning the obligation  and the affair began to be very serious  when by accident Mr  Morgan  and one of the master s mates  coming that way  interposed  and inquiring into the cause  endeavoured to promote a reconciliation  but finding us both exasperated to the uttermost  and bent against accommodation  they advised us  either to leave our difference undecided till we should have an opportunity of terminating it on shore  like gentlemen  or else chuse a proper place on board  and bring it to an issue by boxing  This last expedient was greedily embraced  and being forthwith conducted to the ground proposed  we stript in a moment  and began a very furious contest  in which I soon found myself inferior to my antagonist  not so much in strength and agility  as in skill  which he had acquired in the   245 school at Hockley in the Hole and Tottenham Court —Many cross buttocks did I sustain  and pegs on the stomach without number  till at last  my breath being quite gone  as well as my vigour wasted  I grew desperate  and collecting all my spirits in one effort  threw in at once head  hands  and feet with such violence  that I drove my antagonist three paces backward into the main hatch way  down which he fell  and pitching upon his head and right shoulder  remained without sense and motion —Morgan looking down  and seeing him lie in that condition  cried     Upon my conscience  as I am a Christian sinner  look you  I believe his pattles are all ofer  but I take you all to witness that there was no treachery in the case  and that he has suffered by the chance of war  —  So saying  he descended to the deck below  to examine into the situation of my adversary  and left me very little pleased with my victory  as I found myself not only terribly bruised  but likewise in danger of being called to account for the death of Crampley  But this fear vanished when my fellow mate  having by bleeding him in the juglar  brought him to himself  and assured himself of the state of his body  called up to me  to be under no concern  for the midshipman had received no other damage than as pretty a luxation of the os humeri  as one would desire to see on a summer s day —Upon this information  I crawled down to the cockpit  and acquainted Thomson with the affair  who  providing himself with bandages   c  necessary for the occasion  went up to assist Mr  Morgan in the reduction of the dislocation —When this was successfully performed  they wished me joy of the event of the combat  and the   246 Welchman  after observing  that in all likelihood  the ancient Scots and Britons were the same people  bid me   Praise Cot for putting mettle in my pelly  and strength in my limbs to support it  —  I acquired such reputation by this recounter  which lasted twenty minutes  that every body became more cautious of his behaviour towards me  though Crampley with his arm in a sling  talked very high  and threatened to seize the first opportunity of retrieving on shore  the honour he had lost by an accident  from which I could justly claim no merit     About this time  captain Oakhum  having received sailing orders  came on board  and brought along with him a surgeon of his own country  who soon made us sensible of the loss we suffered in the departure of doctor Atkins  being grossly ignorant  and intolerably assuming  false  vindictive  and unforgiving  a merciless tyrant to his inferiors  an abject sycophant to those above him  In the morning after the captain came on board  our first mate  according to custom  went to wait on him with a sick list  which when this grim commander had perused  he cried with a stern countenance     Blood and oons  sixty one sick people on board of my ship —Harkee you  sir  I ll have no sick in my ship  by G—d    The Welchman replied  he should be very glad to find no sick people on board  but while it was otherwise  he did no more than his duty in presenting him with a list —   You and your list may be d—n d   said the captain  throwing it at him  I say  there shall be no sick in this ship while I have the command of her  —  Mr  Morgan being nettled at this treatment  told him  his indignation ought to be directed   247 to Got Almighty  who visited his people with distempers  and not to him  who contributed all in his power towards their cure  The Bashaw not being used to such behaviour in any of his officers  was enraged to fury at this satirical insinuation  and stamping with his foot  called him insolent scoundrel  threatning to have him pinioned to the deck  if he should presume to utter another syllable  But the blood of Caractacus being thoroughly heated  disdained
