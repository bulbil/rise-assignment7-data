as I hoped    seen my error so early  and that with such a stock of youth and health   on my side  in all appearance  I can truly abhor my past liberties  and   pity poor Sally Godfrey  from the same motives that I admire my Pamela s   virtues  and resolve to make myself as worthy of them as possible  And   I will hope  my dear  your prayers for my pardon  and my perseverance    will be of no small efficacy on this occasion       These agreeable reflections  on this melancholy but instructive story    brought us in view of his own house  and we alighted  and took a walk   in the garden till dinner was ready  And now we are so busy about making   ready for our appearance  that I shall hardly have time to write till   that be over          Monday morning       Yesterday we set out  attended by John  Abraham  Benjamin  and Isaac  in   fine new liveries  in the best chariot  which had been new cleaned  and   lined  and new harnessed  so that it looked like a quite new one  But   I had no arms to quarter with my dear lord and master s  though he   jocularly  upon my taking notice of my obscurity  said  that he had a   good mind to have the olive branch  which would allude to his hopes    quartered for mine  I was dressed in the suit I mentioned  of white   flowered with silver  and a rich head dress  and the diamond necklace    ear rings  etc  I also mentioned before  And my dear sir  in a fine   laced silk waistcoat  of blue paduasoy  and his coat a pearl coloured   fine cloth  with gold buttons and button holes  and lined with white   silk  and he looked charmingly indeed  I said  I was too fine  and would   have laid aside some of the jewels  but he said  It would be thought   a slight to me from him  as his wife  and though as I apprehended    it might be  that people would talk as it was  yet he had rather they   should say any thing  than that I was not put upon an equal footing  as   his wife  with any lady he might have married       It seems the neighbouring gentry had expected us  and there was a great   congregation  for  against my wish  we were a little of the latest  so   that  as we walked up the church to his seat  we had abundance of gazers   and whisperers  But my dear master behaved with so intrepid an air  and   was so cheerful and complaisant to me  that he did credit to his kind   choice  instead of shewing as if he was ashamed of it  And as I was   resolved to busy my mind entirely with the duties of the day  my   intentness on that occasion  and my thankfulness to God  for his   unspeakable mercies to me  so took up my thoughts  that I was much   less concerned  than I should otherwise have been  at the gazings and   whisperings of the ladies and gentlemen  as well as of the rest of the   congregation  whose eyes were all turned to our seat       When the sermon was ended  we staid the longer  because the church   should be pretty empty  but we found great numbers at the church doors    and in the church porch  and I had the pleasure of hearing many   commendations  as well of my person  as my dress and behaviour  and not   one reflection  or mark of disrespect  Mr  Martin  who is single  Mr    Chambers  Mr  Arthur  and Mr  Brooks  with their families  were all   there  And the four gentlemen came up to us  before we went into the   chariot  and  in a very kind and respectful manner  complimented us   both  and Mrs  Arthur and Mrs  Brooks were so kind as to wish me joy    and Mrs  Brooks said  You sent Mr  Brooks  madam  home t other day    quite charmed with a manner  which  you have convinced a thousand   persons this day  is natural to you       You do me great honour  madam  replied I  Such a good lady s approbation   must make me too sensible of my happiness  My dear master handed me into   the chariot  and stood talking with Sir Thomas Atkyns  at the door   of it   who was making him abundance of compliments  and is a very   ceremonious gentleman  a little too extreme in that way
