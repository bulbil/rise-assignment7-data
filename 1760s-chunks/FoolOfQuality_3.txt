 plainly see it  that Nature intends that this child should   act some great part on the theatre of human life  Nature    I say  or rather the God of Nature  has endowed him with   an excellent memory  and the seeds of taste already begin   to peep forth  Young as he is  he is interested in every    thing that interests man     I was walking with Harry the   other day   continues Mr  Felix    and as we were passing by   an old hedge he pointed to a bush    If I chose   said he    11 1 could have caught a thrush on her nest in that bush    but I would not for the world   added he    be guilty of   such a cruel act  I was afraid that some of the other boys   would have found it  but luckily  they did not   so that to   my great joy  the mother and her young have escaped       This reminds one strongly of the earlier chapters of The   Fool of Quality  the autobiographic element of which   should not be lost sight of autobiographic  that is  as an   interpretation of character      Dr  Thomas Sheridan    the Quintilian of his day   and   the grandfather of Richard Brinsley Sheridan  was a more   remarkable character even than Comerford  and rivalled   Person not only as a classical scholar  but also as a wit and   good liver  Swift and he were at one time close friends    The Dean was often entertained at Rantavan on his way to   visit Sheridan at Quilca  But Swift presently quarrelled   with his old friend  and  not content with gibing at him   living  assailed him savagely after his death  Young Brooke   was so nettled by a satire that Swift had written on the   home of the Sheridans at Quilca  where he had often   been an honoured guest  that he attempted to retaliate   in kind  A set of verses entitled  Quilca House to the   Dean   was fathered on a certain dancing  master  Peter   Murray  who was so pleased with the notoriety they gave   him  that he forthwith provided a continuation from his   own pen  Dr  Johnson said to Sheridan  whom he did         INTRODUCTION ix     not like personally  that he   wanted neither parts nor   literature  but that his vanity and Quixotism obscured his   merits   Harry Brooke  the Doctor s favourite pupil  gives a   more generous testimony to his talents and his character    Several of Harry s cousins were taught by Dr  Sheridan      The university register already quoted proves that Henry   Brooke went to a third school  about which nothing further   is known  Brookiana preserves many relics of his juvenilia    prose and verse  none of them in any way remarkable    except as showing his natural bent for literary composition    Dr  Sheridan made him an excellent classical scholar  but   the share Dominie Comerford had had in his education   must not be forgctten  It was largely to his mother and   her training that he owed his deep religious fervour  and his   love of civil and religious liberty  both of which were to be   exhibited powerfully in his conduct and his writings  and to   have no small effect upon his fortunes      Though Henry had been entered as a pensioner at   Trinity College  Dublin  and duly served his terms  he   was not intended by his father to follow his own footsteps   in the Church  but was sent to London in 1724 to read   law  In his short stay at the Temple  he made the   acquaintance of several men of wit and learning  including   Pope and Lord Lyttelton   Swift he had already met at   Rantavan  The Dean is reported to have said that   Brooke was a   young man of genius  but he was sorry to   find that genius incline to poetry  which of all other pur    suits was the most unprofitable   He treated the young   man with great kindness and indulgence  and was repaid   by sincere admiration for his powers and keen sympathy   with the patriotism displayed in the DrapieSs Letters    Brooke was suddenly recalled to Ireland by the news that   a beloved aunt was on her death bed      He arrived in time to receive the blessing of his relative    who delivered to his guardianship her daughter  Catherine   Meares  a beautiful girl of twelve  The relationship seems   to have been on his mother s  the Digbys   side  The child   was left with but
