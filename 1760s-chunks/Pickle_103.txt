finished  the fate of Hornbeck immediately  but his inamorata disapproved of his  intention  and represented that their being together by themselves for  any length of time would be observed by her servant  who was kept as a  spy upon her actions  so that they had recourse to another scheme which  was executed in this manner  He conducted her into her own apartment in  presence of her footman  who lighted them thither  and wishing her good  rest  returned to his own chamber  where he waited till everything was  quiet in the house  then stealing softly to her door  which had been  left open for his admission in the dark  he found the husband still  secure in the embraces of sleep  and the lady in a loose gown  ready to  seal his happiness  He conveyed her to his own chamber  but his guilty  passion was not gratified   The opium which had been given to Jolter  together with the wine he had  drunk  produced such a perturbation in his fancy  that he was visited  with horrible dreams  and  among other miserable situations  imagined  himself in danger of perishing in the flames  which he thought had taken  hold on his apartment  This vision made such an impression upon his  faculties  that he alarmed the whole house with repeated cries of  Fire   fire   and even leaped out of his bed  though he still continued fast  asleep  The lovers were very disagreeably disturbed by this dreadful  exclamation  and Mrs  Hornbeck  running in great confusion to the door   had the mortification to see the footman  with a light in his hand   enter her husband s chamber  in order to give him notice of this  accident  She knew that she would be instantly missed  and could easily  divine the consequence  unless her invention could immediately trump up  some plausible excuse for her absence   Women are naturally fruitful of expedients in cases of such emergency   she employed but a few seconds in recollection  and  rushing directly  towards the apartment of the governor  who still continued to hallo in  the same note  exclaimed  in a screaming tone   Lord have mercy upon us   where  where   By this time  all the servants were assembled in strange  attire  Peregrine burst into Jolter s room  and seeing him stalking in  his shirt  with his eyes shut  bestowed such a slap upon his back  as in  a moment dissolved his dream  and restored him to the use of his senses   He was astonished and ashamed at being discovered in such an indecent  attitude  and  taking refuge under the clothes  asked pardon of all  present for the disturbance he had occasioned  soliciting  with great  humility  the forgiveness of the lady  who  to a miracle  counterfeited  the utmost agitation of terror and surprise  Meanwhile Hornbeck  being  awaked by the repeated efforts of his man  no sooner understood that his  wife was missing  than all the chimeras of jealousy taking possession of  his imagination  he started up in a sort of frenzy  and  snatching his  sword  flew straight to Peregrine s chamber  where  though he found not  that which he looked for  he unluckily perceived an under petticoat   which his wife had forgot in the hurry of her retreat  This discovery    6 22 15  3 45 PM   added fuel to the flame of his resentment  He seized the fatal proof of  his dishonour  and  meeting his spouse in her return to bed  presented  it to her view  with a most expressive countenance   Madam  you have  dropped your under petticoat in the next room    Mrs  Hornbeck  who inherited from nature a most admirable presence of  mind  looked earnestly at the object in question  and  with incredible  serenity of countenance  affirmed that the petticoat must belong to the  house  for she had none such in her possession  Peregrine  who walked  behind her  hearing this asseveration  immediately interposed  and  pulling Hornbeck by the sleeve into his chamber   Gadszooks   said he    what business had you with that petticoat  Can t you let a young fellow  enjoy a little amour with an innkeeper s daughter  without exposing his  infirmities to your wife  Pshaw  that s so malicious  because you have  quitted these adventures yourself  to spoil the sport of other people    The poor husband was so confounded at the effrontery of his wife  and  this cavalier declaration of the young man  that his faith began to  waver  he distrusted his own conscious diffidence of temper  which  that  he might not expose  he expressed no doubts of Peregrine s veracity   but  asking pardon for the mistake he had committed  retired  He was not  yet satisfied with the behaviour of his ingenious helpmate  but on the  contrary determined to inquire more minutely into the circumstances of  this adventure  which turned out so little to his satisfaction  that he
