advised him to double the last  specified term  because he distinguished in his features something  portending extreme old age and second childhood  and he ought to provide  for that state of incapacity  which other wise would be attended with  infinite misery and affliction  The superannuated wretch  thunderstruck  with this prediction  held up his hands  and in the first transports  of his apprehension  exclaimed   Lord have mercy upon me  I have not  wherewithal to purchase such a long lease  and I have long outlived all  my friends  what then must become of me  sinner that I am  one hundred  and twenty years hence   Cadwallader  who enjoyed his terror   under pretence of alleviating his concern  told him that what he had  prognosticated did not deprive him of the means which he and every  person had in their power  to curtail a life of misfortune  and the old  gentleman went away  seemingly comforted with the assurance  that  it would always be in his power to employ an halter for his own  deliverance   Soon after the retreat of this elder  the magician was visited by one  of those worthies known among the Romans by the appellation of  haeredipetae  who had amassed a large for tune by a close attention  to the immediate wants and weakness of raw  inexperienced heirs   This honourable usurer had sold an annuity upon the life of a young  spendthrift  being thereto induced by the affirmation of his physician   who had assured him his patient s constitution was so rotten  that he  could not live one year to an end  He had  nevertheless  made shift to  weather eighteen months  and now seemed more vigorous and healthy  than he had ever been known  for he was supposed to have nourished an  hereditary pox from his cradle  Alarmed at this alteration  the seller  came to consult Cadwallader  not only about the life of the annuitant   but also concerning the state of his health at the time of his  purchasing the annuity  purposing to sue the physician for false  intelligence  should the conjurer declare that the young man was  sound when the doctor pronounced him diseased  But this was a piece of  satisfaction he did not obtain from the misanthrope  who  in order  to punish his sordid disposition  gave him to understand  that the  physician had told him the truth  and nothing but the truth  and that  the young gentleman was in a fair way of attaining a comfortable old  age   That is to say   cried the client  in the impatience of his  mortification at this answer   bating accidents  for  thank God  the  annuitant does not lead the most regular life  Besides  I am credibly  informed he is choleric and rash  so that he may be concerned in a duel     6 22 15  3 45 PM   Then there are such things as riots in the street  in which a rake s  skull may be casually cracked  he may be overturned in a coach  overset  in the river  thrown from a vicious horse  overtaken with a cold   endangered by a surfeit  but what I place my chief confidence in  is an  hearty pox  a distemper which hath been fatal to his whole family  Not  but that the issue of all these things is uncertain  and expedients  might be found which would more effectually answer the purpose  I know  they have arts in India  by which a man can secure his own interest  in  the salutation of a friendly shake by the hand  and I don t doubt that  you  who have lived in that country  are master of the secret  To be  sure  if you were inclined to communicate such a nostrum  there are  abundance of people who would purchase it at a very high price    Cadwallader understood this insinuation  and was tempted to amuse him  in such a manner as would tend to his disgrace and confusion  but   considering that the case was of too criminal a nature to be tampered  with  he withstood his desire of punishing this rapacious cormorant any  other way than by telling him he would not impart the secret for his  whole for tune ten times doubled  so that the usurer retired  very much  dissatisfied with the issue of his consultation   The next person who presented himself at this altar of intelligence   was an author  who recommended himself to a gratis advice  by observing   that a prophet and poet were known by the same appellation among the  ancients  and that  at this day  both the one and the other spoke by  inspiration  The conjurer refused to own this affinity  which  he said   formerly subsisted  because both species of the vates were the children  of fiction  but as he himself did not fall under that predicament  he  begged leave to disown all connection with the family of the poets  and  the poor author would have been dismissed without his errand  though he  offered to leave an ode as
