            CHAPTER XX       More of the same          Mr  Markland did not  like too many of his profession  ever flatter his   clients with an assurance of success in any cause of which he himself   was doubtful  he plainly told Mrs  Munden  that he feared not all the   ill usage she had sustained would be sufficient to compel her husband to   allow her a separate maintenance   Honour and generosity may  indeed     added he   oblige him to do that which  I am very apprehensive  the law   will not enforce him to         Alas   cried Mrs  Munden  bursting into tears   if I can have no relief   but from his honour and generosity  I must be miserable     Not so  my   dear sister   said Mr  Thoughtless   while you have a brother who has it   in his power to support you against all the injuries of fortune  and the   injustice of a husband so unworthy of you        She thanked him in terms which so affectionate an offer demanded from   her  but could not help appearing very much dejected at what Mr    Markland had said to her  on which   Madam   said he   though the letter   of the law may not be altogether so favourable for you in this point as   you certainly deserve  yet  notwithstanding that  and how refractory   soever Mr  Munden may be in his principles or dispositions  I hope there   may be means found to bring him to do you justice  I will wait on   him  will talk to him in a proper manner  and do flatter myself with   being able to give you a good account of what I have done        It is not to be doubted but both the brother and the sister earnestly   intreated he would exert all his abilities in an affair which they   easily saw would be difficult enough to manage  but the answers of this   honest  good natured gentleman  soon convinced them that there was no   need of any persuasions to induce him to do every thing in his power for   the service of ill treated innocence       Mrs  Munden having told him that about eleven o clock was the most   certain time for her husband to be spoke with  he went the next morning   at that hour  on sending up his name  Mr  Munden guessed the errand on   which he came  but that did not hinder him from ordering he should be   introduced  nor  when he was so  from receiving him with that politeness   he always used to strangers       Mr  Markland began with telling him he was extremely sorry for the   occasion on which he waited on him that morning   I little imagined     said he   that when I drew up the articles for an union between you    Sir  and Mrs  Munden  I should ever have been employed in transacting a   deed of separation  but  since it has unhappily proved so  I hope  at   least  it may be done as amicably as the nature of the thing will   admit        Mr  Munden at first affected to treat this proposal in a manner somewhat   ludicrous  but perceiving it was not well taken by the other   You will   pardon me  Sir   cried he   I protest I am under the greatest   consternation in the world  that my wife should have the assurance to   trouble a gentleman of your character on so foolish an affair  upon my   honour  Sir  there is nothing in it but mere whim  caprice         If I did not think it sufficiently serious   replied Mr  Markland   and   were not also well convinced you will hereafter find it so  I should not   have given either myself or you the trouble of this visit  but  Sir     continued he   you may depend that the lady s complaints will have their   weight         All womanish spite  upon my soul  Sir   resumed Mr  Munden   I defy her   to accuse me of any one action that can justify her quitting my house    much less to prove any real injury received from me  without which  you   know  Sir  there can be no pretence for separation         You cannot as yet  Sir  be sensible what is in her power to prove     said the lawyer   but God forbid this unhappy dissention should ever   come to that
