He now proclaims your innocence even from the mouth of your most inveterate enemy  And lifting up her eyes  Thou hast turned the hearts of sinners to the wisdom of the just  therefore shall the righteous give Thee thanks  And then  God forgive that woman all her sins for this one act  and God forgive Mr Faulkland his sins  and reward him for this goodness  Sure your husband will relent now  sure he will long to take my poor  forsaken  virtuous child  and her tears gushed as she spoke   to his bosom again   I could not answer her for some time  my own tears almost choaked me  at last I said  My dear mother  I have no doubt of Mr Arnold’s returning kindness  he will  I hope  be convinced that I am guiltless  and we may yet be happy   She dried her eyes  God send  God send you may  But what has Mr Faulkland done with his poor penitent  I hope he will behave honourably to her  for this excellent parent had no doubt but that the letter  written by Mrs Gerrarde was  in a great measure  the result of her own contrition  for as I had not been minute in giving her a particular account of all the previous steps taken by Mr Faulkland to obtain it from her  she had not the least idea that Mrs Gerrarde had writ in that manner from any other motive than the good one which appeared obvious to her   I told her  that I feared Mrs Gerrarde was far from being the penitent she supposed her  and then acquainted her with the true reasons which had induced her to write in the manner she had done  I then proceeded to tell her of her behaviour after writing the letter  and how Mr Faulkland had acted in consequence of that  concluding with informing her of Mrs Gerrarde’s being married  and provided for in a very reputable way   My mother was highly delighted at this last circumstance  for  she said  Mr Faulkland had no right to be the punisher of her crimes  and if he had not made a decent provision for her  she would never have looked upon him but as a dishonest person   She told me  that though she was very glad  upon the whole  that Mr Arnold and that bad woman were separated  yet she was nevertheless not quite so well satisfied with the manner of it  for I think  said she  that it is impossible but that a man of Mr Arnold’s good sense must  one time or other  have been convinced of his error  and  of his own accord  returned to a right way of thinking   I answered  that might possibly have happened  but that he might    have continued long enough under his infatuation intirely to ruin his family  and as for what regarded me in particular  I knew of no means so likely to remove his unjust suspicions effectually  as those which Mr Faulkland had taken   You are right  my dear  said she  let us hope the best  I am glad Mr Faulkland does not mean to return soon to England  there is but one event which could ever reconcile me to his doing so  and that is  in order to do justice to the unfortunate Miss Burchell  If he would wipe out that blot in his character by marrying her  I should again allow him to be a good man  at present  I own  I can’t help being dissatisfied  that one  so blameable as I think him  should have laid my daughter under the obligations which he has done   I said it would rejoice me if he could be prevailed on to make Miss Burchell the reparation she mentioned  but I feared she had no advocate with Mr Faulkland  though I was of opinion  if he were made acquainted with the life of sorrow she led  as well as her reserved and modest behaviour  he would be inclined to favour her  especially if he were to see the poor little boy   My mother said  He never could expect quiet of mind  till he had wiped the tears from her eyes   Miss Burchell came in while we were speaking of her  my mother is always glad to see her  The poor girl had been exceedingly shocked at Mr Faulkland’s carrying away her aunt  She thought this action put such an invincible bar between her and her hopes  almost desperate before   that it went near to distract her  for though there was no consanguinity in the case  yet the degree of relationship between her and Mrs Gerrarde  made her look upon this amour  for so she considered it  with the utmost horror  She had so often expressed her sense of it in so lively a manner  both to my mother and me  that had Mr Faulkland even been inclined to offer his hand  she could not  consistently either with virtue or common decency  have accepted of it   My mother  ever delighted with acts of humanity  was in haste to communicate the true state of the case to Miss Burchell  It was her interest to keep our secret  therefore I made no scruple of trusting her with it  especially as
