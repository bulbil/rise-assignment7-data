with your meanest servant  if I had thought I could       have got safe to my beloved poverty   I heard you once say  sir        That a certain great commander  who could live upon lentils  might       well refuse the bribes of the greatest monarch  And I hope  as I       can contentedly live at the meanest rate  and think not myself       above the lowest condition  that I am also above making an exchange       of my honesty for all the riches of the Indies   When I come to be       proud and vain of gaudy apparel  and outside finery  then  which I       hope will never be  may I rest my principal good in such vain       trinkets  and despise for them the more solid ornaments of a good       fame  and a chastity inviolate          Give me leave to say  sir  in answer to what you hint  That you may in   a twelvemonth s time marry me  on the continuance of my good behaviour    that this weighs less with me  if possible  than any thing else you have   said  for  in the first place  there is an end of all merit  and all   good behaviour  on my side  if I have now any  the moment I consent to   your proposals  And I should be so far from expecting such an honour    that I will pronounce  that I should be most unworthy of it  What  sir    would the world say  were you to marry your harlot  That a gentleman of   your rank in life should stoop  not only to the base born Pamela  but to   a base born prostitute   Little  sir  as I know of the world  I am not   to be caught by a bait so poorly covered as this       Yet  after all  dreadful is the thought  that I  a poor  weak    friendless  unhappy creature  am too full in your power  But permit me    sir  to pray  as I now write on my bended knees  That before you resolve   upon my ruin  you will weigh well the matter  Hitherto  sir  though you   have taken large strides to this crying sin  yet are you on this side   the commission of it   When once it is done  nothing can recall it  And   where will be your triumph   What glory will the spoils of such a weak   enemy yield you  Let me but enjoy my poverty with honesty  is all my   prayer  and I will bless you  and pray for you  every moment of my life    Think  O think  before it is yet too late  what stings  what remorse   will attend your dying hour  when you come to reflect  that you have   ruined  perhaps soul and body  a wretched creature  whose only pride   was her virtue  And how pleased you will be  on the contrary  if in   that tremendous moment you shall be able to acquit yourself of this foul   crime  and to plead in your own behalf  that you suffered the earnest   supplications of an unhappy wretch to prevail with you to be innocent   yourself  and let her remain so   May God Almighty  whose mercy so   lately saved you from the peril of perishing in deep waters   on which    I hope  you will give me cause to congratulate you   touch your heart   in my favour  and save you from this sin  and me from this ruin   And   to him do I commit my cause  and to him will I give the glory  and   night and day pray for you  if I may be permitted to escape this great   evil           Your poor oppressed  broken spirited servant          I took a copy of this for your perusal  my dear parents  if I shall ever   be so happy to see you again   for I hope my conduct will be approved   of by you   and at night  when Sir Simon was gone  he sent for me down    Well  said he  have you considered my proposals  Yes  sir  said I  I   have  and there is my answer  But pray let me not see you read it  Is it   your bashfulness  said he  or your obstinacy  that makes you not choose   I should read it before you       I offered to go away  and he said  Don t run
