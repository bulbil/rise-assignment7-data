to offer any reply  but yielded to the conviction of arguments bo   conclusive  By this time the wind and tide served for us   we   arrived in Holland without anything remarkable  I should  how    ever  mention to you the sordid hypocrisy of my master  who  not   to violate the custom of his race  made a pretence of poverty  to   get his passage without expense          CHAPTER Xn     THEY ABBIVB AT THE HAGTTE â€” POUTICAL CONVEESATION BETWEEN   A DUTCHMAN AND A JEW â€” THEY DUTBB IN OPINION â€” AMTNADAB   LEAVES HIS FEIBND  VAN HOGAN  IN GBEAT DISTBESS     As soon as he arrived at the Hague  my master set his son to   prepare for their immediate departure  while he went himself for a   moment to speak to one of the principal members of the States      There was little ceremony between a Dutchman and a Jew  but   entering directly upon business â€”   My friend Aminadab    said his   mightiness    I am glad to see you  I hope you have brought us   good news  and that there is a stop put to the insolence of those   English pirates  who  in a manner  block up our ports  and have   almost ruined our trade          Really  my friend Van Hogan    replied my master    I am sorry   that I cannot give you any satisfactory account of that affair     for such is the perverseness of people in power there at present    that they will not listen to any arguments          Will they not take money           No  indeed   nor does the boldest of us all know how to offer   it with safety  it was rejected with such indignant rage the last time    though  indeed  the offer was a tempting one  I have seen the day    and that not very long since  when half the sum would have done   twice as much  But matters are most strangely altered of late    They have got a manager   who neither drinks nor games  keeps   running horses nor whores  nor lives above his private fortune    and therefore has not such pressing demands for money as used to   make our negotiators go on so smoothly with others formerly          Death   what shall we do   Is the whole court corrupted   by this example   Are they all infected with such a strange   madness           No  it is not gone so far as that yet  and it is to be hoped that   the example of a few will not be able to do so much  and that    when the novelty of this humour wears off a little  it will go out of   fashion insensibly  and things return to their old course  This is   supposing the worst  that the engines now at work to overturn this   new set should miscarry         But  what must we do in the meantime   We shall be ruined       William Pitt  whose unfashionable disinterestedness and incorrupti    bility were one secret of his popularity          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 20      before that may happen  We must declare war  and do ourselves   justice          But may not the remedy there be worse than the disease     Are your affairs in such a condition as to entitle you to take such a   step   Consider what a mighty naval force they have at this time    Consider how you will be able to resist it          That is the thing  the only thing  that has kept us quiet so   long  But something must be done   another Amboyna  affair    or some such stroke  must bring us satisfaction and revenge   too          Take care  my friend  be cautious what you do   this is no time   for such strokes  nor are the present governors such people as those   who suffered them so tamely   they will be apt to return the stroke   in a manner that may be attended with consequences too   dreadful to be hazarded  I hate those haughty islanders as much   as you  except some few particulars  The sense of the whole nation   has ever been against us   nor would they suffer us among them   now  but that we have availed ourselves so well of the favour of   those few  as to  get the command of almost all
