ALMORAN AND HAMET      An Oriental Tale in Two Volumes      by      JOHN HAWKESWORTH      MDCCLXI                        VOLUME FIRST               TO THE KING         SIR       Amidst the congratulations and praises of a free  a joyful  and now   united people  people  who are ambitious to express their duty and   their wishes in their various classes  I think myself happy to have YOUR   MAJESTY S most gracious permission to approach You  and  after the   manner of the people whose character I have assumed  to bring an humble   offering in my hand       As some part of my subject led me to consider the advantages of our   excellent constitution in comparison of others  my thoughts were   naturally turned to YOUR MAJESTY  as its warmest friend and most   powerful protector  and as the whole is intended  to recommend the   practice of virtue  as the means of happiness  to whom could I address   it with so much propriety  as to a PRINCE  who illustrates and enforces   the precepts of the moralist by his life       I am      May it please Your MAJESTY          Your MAJESTY S       Most faithful  most obliged          And most obedient           Subject and Servant       John Hawkesworth                CHAP  I          Who is he among the children of the earth  that repines at the power of   the wicked  and who is he  that would change the lot of the righteous    He  who has appointed to each his portion  is God  the Omniscient and   the Almighty  who fills eternity  and whose existence is from Himself    but he who murmurs  is man  who yesterday was not  and who to morrow   shall be forgotten  let him listen in silence to the voice of knowlege    and hide the blushes of confusion in the dust       Solyman  the mighty and the wife  who  in the one hundred and second   year of the Hegyra  sat upon the throne of Persia  had two sons  ALMORAN   and HAMET  and they were twins  ALMORAN was the first born  but Solyman   divided his affection equally between them  they were both lodged in the   same part of the seraglio  both were attended by the same servants  and   both received instructions from the same teacher       One of the first things that ALMORAN learnt  was the prerogative of his   birth  and he was taught very early to set a high value upon it  by the   terms in which those about him expressed their sense of the power  the   splendor  and the delights of royalty  As his mind gradually opened  he   naturally considered these as the objects of universal define  and the   means of supreme felicity  he was often reminded  that the time was   coming  when the sole possession of sovereign power would enable him to   fulfil all his wishes  to determine the fate of dependent nations with a   nod  and dispense life and death  and happiness and misery  at his will    he was flattered by those who hoped to draw wealth and dignity from his   favour  and interest prompted all who approached him  to administer to   his pleasures with a zeal and assiduity  which had the appearance of   reverence to his merit  and affection to his person       HAMET  on the contrary  soon became sensible of a subordinate station    he was not  indeed  neglected  but he was not much caressed  When the   gratification of HAMET came in competition with that of ALMORAN  he was   always obliged to give it up  except when Solyman interposed  his mind   was  therefore  naturally led to seek for happiness in objects very   different from those which had fixed the attention of ALMORAN  As he   knew not to how narrow a sphere caprice or jealousy might confine him    he considered what pleasures were least dependent upon external   advantages  and as the first popular commotion which mould happen after   his brother s accession to the throne  might probably cost him his life    he was very inquisitive about the state into which his spirit would be   dismissed by the Angel of Death  and very diligent to do whatever might   secure him a share
