ALMEIDA  as he would otherwise be excluded by the delegates of his own   authority  turning  therefore  to Osmyn   Remember   said he   that   whenever HAMET shall return  it is my command  that he be admitted to   ALMEIDA        Osmyn  who was pleased with an opportunity of recommending himself to   ALMORAN  by praising an act of generous virtue which he supposed him now   to exert in favour of his brother  received the command with a look    that expressed not only approbation but joy   Let the sword of   destruction   said he   be the guard of the tyrant  the strength of my   lord shall be the bonds of love  those  who honour thee as ALMORAN    shall rejoice in thee as the friend of HAMET   To ALMORAN  who was   conscious to no kindness for his brother  the praise of Osmyn was a   reproach  he was offended at the joy which he saw kindled in his   countenance  by a command to shew favour to HAMET  and was fired with   sudden rage at that condemnation of his real conduct  which was implied   by an encomium on the generosity of which he assumed the appearance for   a malevolent and perfidious purpose  his brow was contracted  his lip   quivered  and the hilt of his dagger was again grasped in his hand    Osmyn was again overwhelmed with terror and confusion  he had again   offended  but knew not his offence  In the mean time  ALMORAN   recollecting that to express displeasure against Osmyn was to betray his   own secret  endeavoured to suppress his anger  but his anger was   succeeded by remorse  regret  and disappointment  The anguish of his   mind broke out in imperfect murmurs   What I am  said  he   is  to this   wretch  the object not only of hatred but of scorn  and he commends   only what I am not  in what to him I would seem to be       These sounds  which  tho  not articulate  were yet uttered with great   emotion  were still mistaken by Osmyn for the overflowings of capricious   and causeless anger   My life   says he to himself   is even now   suspended in a doubtful balance  Whenever I approach this tyrant  I   tread the borders of destruction  like a hood winked wretch  who is left   to wander near the brink of a precipice  I know my danger  but which way   soever I turn  I know not whether I shall incur or avoid it        In these reflections  did the reign and the slave pass those moments in   which the sovereign intended to render the slave subservient to his   pleasure or his security  and the slave intended to express a zeal which   he really felt  and a homage which his heart had already paid  Osmyn was   at length  however  dismissed with an assurance  that all was well  and   ALMORAN was again left to reflect with anguish upon the past  to regret   the present  and to anticipate the future with solicitude  anxiety  and   perturbation       He was  however  determined to assume the figure of his brother  by the   talisman which had been put into his power by the Genius  but just as he   was about to form the spell  he recollected  that by the same act he   would impress his own likeness upon HAMET who would consequently be   invested with his power  and might use it to his destruction  This held   him some time in suspense  but reflecting that HAMET might not  perhaps    be apprized of his advantage  till it was too late to improve it  that   he was now a fugitive  and probably alone  leaving Persia behind him   with all the speed he could make  and that  at the worst  if he should   be still near  if he should know the transformation as soon as it should   be made  and should instantly take the most effectual measures to   improve it  yet as he could dissolve the charm in a moment  whenever it   should be necessary for his safety  no formidable danger could be   incurred by the experiment  to which he  therefore  proceeded without   delay                CHAP  XIV          In the mean time  HAMET  to whom his own safety was of no importance but   for the sake of ALMEIDA  resolved  if possible  to conceal himself near   the city  Having  therefore  reached the confines of the desert  by   which it was bounded on the east  he quitted his horse  and determined   to remain
