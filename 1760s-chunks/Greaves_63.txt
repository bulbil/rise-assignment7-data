 Dolly forthwith appeared  and  taking her by the hand  led her to the horses  one of which she mounted in the utmost hurry and trepidation  while the countryman bound the duenna with a cord prepared for the purpose  gagged her mouth  and tied her to a tree  where he left her to her own meditations  Then he mounted before Dolly  and through unfrequented paths conducted his charge to an inn on the post road  where a chaise was ready for their reception   As he refused to proceed farther  lest his absence from his own home should create suspicion  Aurelia rewarded him liberally  but would not part with her faithful Dolly  who indeed had no inclination to be discharged  such an affection and attachment had she already acquired for the amiable fugitive  though she knew neither her story nor her true name  Aurelia thought proper to conceal both  and assumed the fictitious appellation of Meadows  until she should be better acquainted with the disposition and discretion of her new attendant   The first resolution she could take  in the present flutter of her spirits  was to make the best of her way to London  where she thought she might find an asylum in the house of a female relation  married to an eminent physician  known by the name of Kawdle  In the execution of this hasty resolve  she travelled at a violent rate  from stage to stage  in a carriage drawn by four horses  without halting for necessary refreshment or repose  until she judged herself out of danger of being overtaken  As she appeared overwhelmed with grief and consternation  the good natured Dolly endeavoured to alleviate her distress with diverting discourse  and  among other less interesting stories  entertained her with the adventures of Sir Launcelot and Captain Crowe  which she had seen and heard recited while they remained at the Black Lion  nor did she fail to introduce Mr  Thomas Clarke in her narrative  with such a favourable representation of his person and character  as plainly discovered that her own heart had received a rude shock from the irresistible force of his qualifications   The history of Sir Launcelot Greaves was a theme which effectually fixed the attention of Aurelia  distracted as her ideas must have been by the circumstances of her present situation  The particulars of his conduct since the correspondence between him and her had ceased  she heard with equal concern and astonishment  for  how far soever she deemed herself detached from all possibility of future connexion with that young gentleman  she was not made of such indifferent stuff as to learn without emotion the calamitous disorder of an accomplished youth  whose extraordinary virtues she could not but revere   As they had deviated from the post road  taken precautions to conceal their route  and made such progress  that they were now within one day s journey of London  the careful and affectionate Dolly  seeing her dear lady quite exhausted with fatigue  used all her natural rhetoric  which was very powerful  mingled with tears that flowed from the heart  in persuading Aurelia to enjoy some repose  and so far she succeeded in the attempt  that for one night the toil of travelling was intermitted  This recess from incredible fatigue was a pause that afforded our adventurer time to overtake them before they reached the metropolis  that vast labyrinth  in which Aurelia might have been for ever lost to his inquiry   It was in the afternoon of the day which succeeded his departure from the White Hart  that Sir Launcelot arrived at the inn  where Miss Aurelia Darnel had bespoke a dish of tea  and a post chaise for the next stage  He had by inquiry traced her a considerable way  without ever dreaming who the person really was whom he thus pursued  and now he desired to speak with her attendant  Dolly was not a little surprised to see Sir Launcelot Greaves  of whose character she had conceived a very sublime idea from the narrative of Mr  Thomas Clarke  but she was still more surprised when he gave her to understand that he had charged himself with a pocket book  containing the bank notes which Miss Meadows had dropped in the house where they had been threatened with insult  Miss Darnel had not yet discovered her disaster  when her attendant  running into the apartment  presented the prize which she had received from our adventurer  with his compliments to Miss Meadows  implying a request to be admitted into her presence  that he might make a personal tender of his best services   It is not to be supposed that the amiable Aurelia heard unmoved such a message from a person  whom her maid discovered to be the identical Sir Launcelot Greaves  whose story she had so lately related  but as the ensuing scene requires fresh attention in the reader  we shall defer it till another opportunity  when his spirits shall be recruited from the fatigue of this chapter             CHAPTER FIFTEEN  EXHIBITING AN INTERVIEW  WHICH  IT IS TO BE HOPED  WILL INTEREST THE CURIOSITY OF THE READER   The mind of the delicate Aurelia was strangely agitated by the intelligence which she received with her pocket book from Dolly  Confounded as she was by the nature of her situation  she at once perceived that she could not
