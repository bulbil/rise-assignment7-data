 to swerve from that faith which he is going to plight to you  your situation is delicate  and it will require the utmost prudence and circumspection on your part  to secure such an interest in his heart as he now seems inclined to give you  It is not on your personal charms that you are to rely  for subduing  or preserving the affections of such a man as he is  They alone  you see  were not able to effect this  it is to Mr Faulkland’s honour rather than his love  that you are now obliged for the justice he has done you  never let this be out of your thoughts  be grateful  but let your gratitude have dignity in it  and by your behaviour convince your husband that honour was with you a first motive to wish this union  love will then come in with a better grace as a secondary inducement   The freedom of my mother’s observations  and instructions  I was not surprized at  because she always speaks her mind  but the emphasis with which she delivered herself was unusual  Miss Burchell expressed herself as obliged to her  and joined intirely in her opinion  I could perceive  however  she was not pleased with the lecture   When Miss Burchell was gone  my mother told me  she thought it necessary to speak as she had done  Miss Burchell  said she  is not quite the girl I took her for  so much modesty and reserve  I thought I had never met with in a young creature before  when she used to speak of Mr Faulkland  it was with affection indeed  but with such a nice decorum as convinced me of the innocence and purity of her heart  But of late I have observed she has been less delicate in her    expressions of tenderness  such passionate flights have sometimes broke from her  as I did not think becoming in a young woman  and which indeed almost offended me  and this night her joy has been ungoverned  Great reason she has for joy ’tis true  but there are some considerations which ought to have made her chasten that joy into a sober  and  at least seemingly  moderate satisfaction  She loves Mr Faulkland  but let her beware of disgusting a man of his sense by too strong an expression of her fondness   My mother’s observation  and her uncommonly forcible manner of expressing it  struck me prodigiously  It is true I had made the same remarks myself  but as you know she is not extremely penetrating  and in general  but a superficial observer  I was the more surprized at what she said  Miss Burchell’s behaviour must have been formerly very different from what it now is  to have made my mother so sensible of the change  Some considerations  she said  ought to have made her chasten her joy  Perhaps  she meant no more than that the young lady  even in the midst of that joy  had  upon reflection  cause for humiliation  I hope  she did not think that her gaiety on this desired event affected me  who had so warmly promoted it  My mother is too open not to give the full meaning of her thoughts  This may be only the suggestion of my own fancy  yet it has mortified me  I had but little rest last night  and rose this morning by day light  to throw together in writing the above particulars   June 27  Miss Burchell came not to us till late this evening  pleasure danced in her eyes  I whispered to her  We rejoice with you  dear Madam  sincerely rejoice  at your approaching felicity  but our present state will not suffer us to keep pace with you in that gaiety  however justifiable it may be from the cause  restrain yourself a little  my mother will not think you kind  as we are so soon to part with you  She smiled  and thanking me for the hint  immediately composed her features to such a decorum  I will not call it demureness  that it was impossible to discover she was agitated by any extraordinary emotion  I own  I was amazed at the command she so suddenly assumed over her countenance  I was glad  however  she did so  that my mother might not have fresh cause of dislike towards her   She told us that Mr Faulkland had settled a thousand pounds a year on her  and that too without ever having informed himself of the state of her fortune  for  in the hurry of her thoughts  she had    neglected to mention it to him   Generous man  whispered I to myself   She then  with great gravity  applied herself to my mother  and told her  she hoped for the honour of her presence  the next morning  at her own house  where the ceremony was to be performed  before no other witnesses but her ladyship  and the gentlewoman  who had been Mr Faulkland’s housekeeper  and that the following day they purposed retiring to Mr Faulkland’s seat in Hertfordshire  and  after a short stay there  to set out for Ireland   My mother commended Mr Faulkland’s diligence  for having so suddenly disposed every thing for this important event  and told our
