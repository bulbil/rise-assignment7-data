    However sweetly humble and requisite  said he  this may appear to my   dear Pamela s niceness  it befits me to tell you  that I am every moment   more and more pleased with the right you have to my name  and  my dear   life  added he  I have only to wish I may be half as worthy as you are   of the happy knot so lately knit  He then took a pen himself  and   wrote  after Pamela  his most worthy sirname  and I under wrote thus     O rejoice with me  my dear Mrs  Jervis  that I am enabled  by God s   graciousness  and my dear master s goodness  thus to write myself        These letters  and the packet to you  were sent away by Mr  Thomas early   this morning          My dearest master is just gone to take a ride out  and intends to call   upon Lady Jones  Mr  Peters  and Sir Simon Darnford  to invite them   to chapel and dinner to morrow  and says  he chooses to do it himself    because the time is so short  they will  perhaps  deny a servant       I forgot to mention  that Mr  Williams was here yesterday  to ask leave   to go to see his new living  and to provide for taking possession of it    and seemed so pleased with my master s kindness and fondness for me  as   well as his generous deportment to himself  that he left us in such a   disposition  as shewed he was quite happy  I am very glad of it  for it   would rejoice me to be an humble means of making all mankind so  And oh    what returns ought I not to make to the divine goodness  and how ought   I to strive to diffuse the blessings I experience  to all in my   knowledge   For else  what is it for such a worm as I to be exalted    What is my single happiness  if I suffer it  niggard like  to extend no   farther than to myself   But then  indeed  do God Almighty s creatures   act worthy of the blessings they receive  when they make  or endeavour   to make  the whole creation  so far as is in the circle of their power    happy       Great and good God  as thou hast enlarged my opportunities  enlarge also   my will  and make me delight in dispensing to others a portion of that   happiness  which I have myself so plentifully received at the hand   of thy gracious Providence  Then shall I not be useless in my   generation   Then shall I not stand a single mark of thy goodness to a   poor worthless creature  that in herself is of so small account in the   scale of beings  a mere cipher on the wrong side of a figure  but shall   be placed on the right side  and  though nothing worth in myself  shall   give signification by my place  and multiply the blessings I owe to thy   goodness  which has distinguished me by so fair a lot       This  as I conceive  is the indispensable duty of a high condition  and   how great must be the condemnation of poor creatures  at the great day   of account  when they shall be asked  What uses they have made of the   opportunities put into their hands  and are able only to say  We have   lived but to ourselves  We have circumscribed all the power thou hast   given us into one narrow  selfish  compass  We have heaped up treasures   for those who came after us  though we knew not whether they would not   make a still worse use of them than we ourselves did  And how can such   poor selfish pleaders expect any other sentence  than the dreadful    Depart  ye cursed       But sure  my dear father and mother  such persons can have no notion   of the exalted pleasures that flow from doing good  were there to be no   after account at all       There is something so satisfactory and pleasing to reflect on the being   able to administer comfort and relief to those who stand in need of it    as infinitely  of itself  rewards the beneficent mind  And how   often have I experienced this in my good lady s time  though but the   second hand dispenser of her benefits to the poor and sickly  when she   made me her almoner   How have I been affected with the blessings which   the miserable have heaped upon her for her goodness  and upon me for   being but the humble conveyer of her bounty to them
