enjoy myself  and breathe with pleasure the pure air of Paraguay  this part of which is reckoned the Montpelier of South America  and has obtained  on account of its climate  the name of Buenos Ayres —It was in this delicious place  that I gave myself entirely up to the thoughts of my dear Narcissa  whose image still kept full possession of my breast  and whose charms  enhanced by absence  appeared to my imagination  if possible  more engaging than ever  I calculated the profits of my voyage  which even exceeded my expectation  resolved to purchase a handsome sine cure upon my arrival in England  and if I should find the Squire as averse to me as ever  marry his sister by stealth  and in case our family should encrease  rely upon the generosity of my uncle  who was by this time worth a considerable sum   While I amused myself with these agreeable projects  and the transporting hopes of enjoying   326 Narcissa  we were very much caressed by the Spanish gentlemen  who frequently formed parties of pleasure for our entertainment  in which we made excursions a good way into the country  Among those who signalized themselves by their civility to us  there was one Don Antonio de Ribera  a very polite young gentleman  with whom I had contracted an intimate friendship  who invited us one day to his country house  and as a further inducement to our compliance  promised to procure for us the company of an English signor  who had been settled in these parts many years  and acquired the love and esteem of the whole province by his affability  good sense  and honourable behaviour   We accepted his invitation  and set out for his Villa  where we had not been longer than an hour  when the person arrived  in whose favour I had been so much prepossessed —He was a tall man  remarkably well shaped  of a fine mein and appearance commanding respect  and seemed to be turned of sorty  the features of his face were saddened with a reserve and gravity  which in other countries would have been thought the effect of melancholy  but here  appeared to have been contracted by his commerce with the Spaniards  who are remarkable for that severity of countenance  Understanding from Don Antonio  that we were his countrymen  he saluted us all ound very complaisantly  and fixing his eyes attentively on me  uttered a deep sigh —I had been struck with a profound veneration for him at his first coming into the room  and no sooner observed this expression of his sorrow  directed  as it were  in a particular manner to me  than my heart took part in his grief  I sympathized involuntarily    327 and sighed in my turn —Having asked leave of our entertainer  he accosted us in English  professed his satisfaction at seeing so many of his countrymen in such a remote place  and asked the captain  who went by the name of Signor Thoma  from what part of Britain he sailed  and whither he was bound —My uncle told him that we had sailed from the river Thames  and were bound for the same place  by the way of Jamaica  where we intended to take in a lading of sugar   Having satisfied himself in these and other particulars about the state of the war  he gave us to understand  that he had a longing desire to revisit his native country  in consequence of which  he had already transmitted to Europe the greatest part of his fortune in neutral bottoms  and would willingly embark the rest of it  with himself  in our ship  provided the captain had no objection to such a passenger —My uncle very prudently replied  that for his part  he should be glad of his company  if he could procure the consent of the governor  without which he durst not admit him on board  whatever inclination he had to oblige him —The gentleman approved of his discretion  and telling him  that there would be no difficulty in obtaining the connivance of the governor  who was his good friend  shifted the conversation to another subject   I was overjoyed to hear his intention  and already interested myself so much in his favour  that had he been disappointed  I should have been very unhappy  In the course of our entertainment  he eyed me with uncommon attachment  I felt a surprizing attraction towards him  when he spoke  I listened with attention and reverence    328 the dignity of his deportment filled me with affection and awe  and in short  the emotions of my soul  in presence of this stranger  were strong and unaccountable   Having spent the best part of the day with us  he took his leave  telling captain Thoma  that he would hear from him in a short time  He was no sooner gone  than I asked a thousand questions about him  of Don Antonio  who could give me no other satisfaction  than that his name was Don Rodriguez  that he had lived fifteen or sixteen years in these parts  was reputed rich  and supposed to have been unfortunate in his younger years  because he was observed to nourish a pensive melancholy  even from the time of his first settlement among them  but that no body had ventured to
