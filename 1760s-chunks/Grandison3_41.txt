 that the fund which they have to depend upon  to support a law suit  should they commence one  and think fit to employ in it so honest a man as you seem to be  is 100 l  a year  It would be madness  if not injustice  to pay the other 100 l  for such a purpose  when it was left to my discretion to pay it  or not  with a view to discourage that litigious spirit which is one  of an hundred  of this poor woman s bad qualities   And thus  for the present  stands this affair  I look upon my trouble from this woman as over  till some new scheme arises  either among these people  or from others whom she may consult or employ  You and I  when I have the happiness to attend you and my other friends  will not renew the subject   I am   c  CHARLES GRANDISON   LETTER XIV  Miss BYRON  To Miss SELBY    Colnebrooke  Wedn  Mar  22   SIR Charles arrived this morning  just as we had assembled to breakfast  for Lady L  is not an early riser  The moment he entered  sunshine broke out in the countenance of every one   He apologized to all  but me  for his long absence  especially when they had such a guest  were his words  bowing to me  and I thought he sighed  and looked with tender regard upon me  but I dared not ask Miss Grandison whether she saw any thing particular in his devoirs to me   It was owing to his politeness  I presume  that he did not include me in his apologies  because that   101 would have been to suppose  that I had expected him  Indeed I was not displeased  in the main  that he did not compliment me as a third sister  See  Lucy  what little circumstances a doubtful mind will sometimes dwell upon   I was not pleased that he had been so long absent  and had my thoughts to myself upon it  inclining once to have gone back to London  and perhaps should  could I have sansied myself of importance enough to make him uneasy by it  The sex  the sex  Lucy  will my uncle say  but I pretend not to be above its little foibles   But the moment I saw him  all my disgusts were over  After the Anderson  the Danby  the Lord W  affairs  he appeared to me in a much more shining light than an hero would have done  returning in a triumphal car covered with laurels  and dragging captive princes at its wheels  How much more glorious a character is that of The Friend of Mankind  than that of The Conqueror of Nations   He told me  that he paid his compliments yesterday to Mr  and Mrs  Reeves  He mentioned Mr  Deane s visit to him  and said very kind  but just things in his praise  I read not any thing in his eyes  or manner  that gave me uneasiness on the visit that other good man made him   My dear Emily sat generously uneasy  I saw  for the trouble she had been the cause of giving to her best friend  tho  she knew not of a visit  that her mother  and O Hara  and Salmonet  made her guardian on Monday  as the doctor had hinted to us  without giving us particulars   Sir Charles thanked me for my goodness  as he called it  in getting the good girl so happily out of her mother s way  as his Emily would have been too much terrified to see her  And he thanked Lord L  for his tenderness to his ward on that occasion   My Lord gave him the Letter which Mrs  Jervois had left for her daughter  Sir Charles presented it to   102 the young Lady  without looking into it  She instantly returned it to him  in a very graceful manner  We will read it together by and by  my Emily  said he  Dr  Bartlett tells me  there is tenderness in it   The doctor made apologies to him  for having communicated to us some of his Letters—Whatever Dr  Bartlett does  said Sir Charles  must be right But what say my sisters to my proposal of correspondence with them   We should be glad  replied Lady L  to see all you write to Dr  Bartlett  but could not undertake to write you Letter for Letter   Why so   Miss Byron  said Miss Grandison  has put us quite out of heart as to the talent of narrative Letterwriting   I should be greatly honoured with a sight of such Letters of Miss Byron as you  my Lord  have seen  Will Miss Byron  applying to me  favour one brother  and exclude another   Brother  Lucy  I thought he was not at that time  quite so handsome a man as when he first entered the room   I was silent  and blushed  I knew not what answer to make  yet thought I should say something   May we  Sir Charles  said Miss Grandison  hope
