they had no objection  that we should all sup together  They assured us that they should be extremely happy in our company  Here we are  then  all seated round the table  There was one among them who seemed to take the lead  and for whom the rest  though in the main they were on the most intimate terms with him  thought it necessary on some occasions to testify their deference  In case of a dispute  this high gentleman assumed the umpire  he talked in a tone above the common pitch  going so far sometimes as to contradict in no very courtly phrase the sentiments of others  who  far from giving him back his own  were ready to swear to his assertions and crouch under his rebuke  By accident the discourse turned on Andalusia  Moralez happening to launch out into the praise of Seville  the man about whom I have been talking said to him    My good fellow  traveller  you are ringing the chimes on the city which gave birth to me  at least I am a native of the neighbourhood  since the little town of Mayrena is answerable for my appearance in the world  I have the same story to tell you  answered my companion  I am also of Mayrena  and it is scarcely possible but that our families should be acquainted  Whose son are you  An honest notary s  replied the stranger  by name Martin Moralez  As fate will have it  exclaimed my comrade with emotion  the adventure is very remarkable  You are then my eldest brother  Manuel Moralez  Exactly so  said the other  and if my senses do not deceive me  you your very self are my little brother Lewis  whom I left in the cradle when I turned my back upon my father s house  You are right in your conjectures  answered my honest colleague  At this discovery they both got up from table  and almost hugged the breath out of each other s bodies  At last Signor Manuel said to the company    Gentlemen  this circumstance is altogether marvellous  By mere chance  I have met with a brother and have been challenged by him  whom I have not seen for more than twenty years  allow me to introduce him  At once all the travellers  who had risen from their seats out of curiosity and good manners  paid their compliments to the younger Moralez  and made him run the gauntlet through their salutations  When these were over  the party returned to the table  nor did they think any more of an adjournment  Bed time never entered  into their heads  The two brothers sat next to one another  and talked in a whisper about their family affairs  the other guests plied the bottle  and made merry in a louder key   Lewis had a long conference with Manuel  and afterwards  taking me aside  said to me  All these troopers belong to the household of the Count de Montanos  whom the king has very lately appointed to the vice regal government of Majorca  They are convoying the equipage of the viceroy to Alicant  where they are to embark  My brother  who has risen to be steward to that noble man  proposes to take me along with him  and on the difficulty I started about leaving you  he told me that if you would be of the party  he would procure you a good berth  My dear friend  pursued he  I advise you not to stand out against this proposal  Let us take flight together for the island of Majorca  If we find our quarters pleasant  we will fix there  and if they are otherwise  we have nothing to do but to return into Spain   I accepted the proposal with the best grace possible  What a reinforcement  in the person of young Moralez and myself  to the household of the count  We took our departure in a body from the inn  before daybreak  We got to the city of Alicant by long stages  and there I bought a guitar  and arranged my dress in a manner suited to my new destination  before we embarked  Nothing ran in my head but the island of Majorca  and Lewis Moralez was a new man as well as myself  It should seem as though we had bid farewell to the rogueries of this wicked world  Yet  not to play the liar in the ear of so rigorous a confessor as my own conscience  we had a mind not to pass for villains incarnate  now that we had got into company that had some pretensions to decency  and that was the sum total of our honesty  The natural bent of our genius remained much the same  we were still men of business  but just now keeping a vacation  In short  we went on board gallantly and gaily in this lucid interval of innocence  and had no idea but of landing at Majorca under the especial care of Neptune and AEolus  Hardly  however  had we cleared the gulf of Alicant  when a sudden and violent storm arose  enough to have frightened better men  Now is my opportunity  or never  to speak of moving accidents by flood  to set the atmosphere on fire  and give a louder explosion to the thunder
