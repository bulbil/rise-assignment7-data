possibly to my sister   Davers s  and be absent some weeks  But  pray  what pretty neat damsel   was with you  She says  she smiled  and asked  If his honour did not   know who it was  No  said he  I never saw her before  Farmer Nichols    or Farmer Brady  have neither of them such a tight prim lass for a   daughter  have they   Though I did not see her face neither  said he    If your honour won t be angry  said she  I will introduce her into your   presence  for I think  says she  she outdoes our Pamela       Now I did not thank her for this  as I told her afterwards   for it   brought a great deal of trouble upon me  as well as crossness  as you   shall hear   That can t be  he was pleased to say  But if you can find   an excuse for it  let her come in       At that she stept to me  and told me  I must go in with her to her   master  but  said she  for goodness  sake  let him find you out  for he   don t know you  O fie  Mrs  Jervis  said I  how could you serve me so    Besides  it looks too free both in me  and to him  I tell you  said she    you shall come in  and pray don t reveal yourself till he finds you out       So I went in  foolish as I was  though I must have been seen by him   another time  if I had not then  And she would make me take my straw hat   in my hand       I dropt a low courtesy  but said never a word  I dare say he knew me as   soon as he saw my face  but was as cunning as Lucifer  He came up to me    and took me by the hand  and said  Whose pretty maiden are you   I dare   say you are Pamela s sister  you are so like her  So neat  so clean  so   pretty  Why  child  you far surpass your sister Pamela       I was all confusion  and would have spoken  but he took me about the   neck  Why  said he  you are very pretty  child  I would not be so free   with your sister  you may believe  but I must kiss you       O sir  said I  I am Pamela  indeed I am  indeed I am Pamela  her own   self       He kissed me for all I could do  and said  Impossible  you are a   lovelier girl by half than Pamela  and sure I may be innocently free   with you  though I would not do her so much favour       This was a sad trick upon me  indeed  and what I could not expect  and   Mrs  Jervis looked like a fool as much as I  for her officiousness   At   last I got away  and ran out of the parlour  most sadly vexed  as you   may well think       He talked a good deal to Mrs  Jervis  and at last ordered me to come   in to him  Come in  said he  you little villain   for so he called me     Good sirs  what a name was there    who is it you put your tricks upon    I was resolved never to honour your unworthiness  said he  with so much   notice again  and so you must disguise yourself to attract me  and yet   pretend  like an hypocrite as you are          I was out of patience then  Hold  good sir  said I  don t impute   disguise and hypocrisy to me  above all things  for I hate them both    mean as I am  I have put on no disguise   What a plague  said he  for   that was his word  do you mean then by this dress   Why  and please your   honour  said I  I mean one of the honestest things in the world       I have been in disguise  indeed  ever since my good lady your mother   took me from my poor parents  I came to her ladyship so poor and mean    that these clothes I have on  are a princely suit to those I had then    and her goodness heaped upon me rich clothes  and other bounties  and as   I am now returning to my poor parents again so soon  I cannot wear those
