 and I resolved not to interrupt them  nor  if possible  ever let Mr Arnold know that I had made a discovery so fatal to my own peace  and so disadvantageous to him and his friend   The messenger who had been dispatched for my chariot met it by the way  and was now returned with it  I was told that it was at the door  and it was with difficulty I got down stairs  leaning on the woman of the house   I found Mr Faulkland at the door  he saw that I wished to disengage myself from him after he had carried me out of the booth  and though probably he did not take the trouble to excuse the sham commission I gave him  which was indeed with no other view than to get him away  yet I believe he had too much respect to intrude on me  and came then with no other design than to enquire if my chariot had come for me  and how I was after the terrible condition he had left me in  sitting at night in the open air  with nobody but two or three ordinary people about me  and those strangers  This was a piece of civility which humanity  had politeness been out of the question  would have obliged him to  He told me the fire was extinguished  and happily nobody had received any hurt  and that he had only called at that house to know if I were safe  and recovered from the fright and pain he had left me in  I thanked him  and was just stepping  assisted by Mr Faulkland  into the chariot  when Mr Arnold appeared at the door  he was alone  and I concluded  that having heard the chariot rattle up the court yard  he supposed it was the carriage he had ordered for Mrs Gerrarde  and came down to see if it was ready to receive her   The light which the servant  who attended me out  held in his hand  immediately discovered Mr Arnold and me to each other  I could easily distinguish surprize mixed with displeasure in his    countenance  He asked me abruptly  How I came to that place  Which I told him  in few words  The cold civility of a grave bow passed between him and Mr Faulkland  who leaving me in my husband’s hands  wished me a good night  and got into my lord V——’s coach  which waited for him   Though I knew  from the discourse I had overheard  that Mr Arnold did not mean to go home with me  yet as I was now seated in the chariot  I could not avoid asking him  He told me  he was engaged to sup with company at that house  and that probably he should not be at home till late  I knew this beforehand  and  without troubling him with any farther questions  drove home   I have thrown together the strange occurrences of this evening  as well as the tumult of my spirits would give me leave  I shall now lay down my pen  to consider of them a little more calmly  My heart sinks in me—Oh  that I had remained in ignorance — Is it possible  my Cecilia  that Mr Arnold  so good a man  one who married me for love  and who for these two years has been the tenderest  the kindest husband  and to whom I never gave the most distant shadow of offence  should at last be led into—I cannot name it—dare not think of it—yet a thousand circumstances recur to my memory  which now convince me I am unhappy  If I had not been blind  I might have seen it sooner  I recollect some passages  which satisfy me that Mr Arnold’s acquaintance with Mrs Gerrarde did not commence at South park  I remember lady V—— once asked me  had she and I been acquainted in London  I said  No  My lord laughed  and in his blunt way said  I will swear your husband was  for I have seen him hand her out from the play more than once  I never asked Mr Arnold about this  it made no impression on me at the time it was spoke  and went quick out of my thoughts   ’Tis one o’clock  I hear Mr Arnold ring at the outer gate  I tremble all over  and feel as if I feared to see him  Yet why should I fear  I have not injured him   September 2  Mr Arnold staid long enough in his dressing room after he came in last night  to give me time to go to bed before he came up stairs  Not a word passed between us  I slept not the whole night  whether he did or not I cannot tell  He asked me this morning  when he rose  how I did  I told him in great pain  My ancle was prodigiously swelled  and turned quite black  for I had neglected it last night  He    said  you had better let a surgeon see it  and went carelessly out of the room  How new is unkindness to me  my friend  you know I have not been used to it  Mr Arnold adds cruelty too—but let it be so  far be reproaches or
