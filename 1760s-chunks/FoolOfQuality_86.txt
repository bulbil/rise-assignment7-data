night  Ned dropped the end of a   bottom of small twine from the garret window  which Hannah took   across the way  and fastened with a double knot to the knocker   of Vindex s door  And now it is twenty to one that  if Vindex s   family and the rest of the neighbourhood had been even thus far   let into the secret  they would not have been altogether so much   alarmed at the consequences      I have read of generals who could gain  but not maintain con    quests   and of women who could keep all secrets but their own    Thus it happened to Ned  His vanity was at least on a level with   his ingenuity  he was so elated with the success of his recent   stratagem  that he boasted of it to some  and half whispered it to   others  till it came to the ears of the much  exasperated Vindex    Vindex   in the first heat and very boil of his passions  snatches up   a huge rod  just cut from that tree whose bare name strikes terror   through all our seminaries of learning  and taking with him one   of his boarders  he marches directly down to the house of Mr    Fenton  and thus formidably armed he enters the fatal schoolroom      Ned  by great good fortune for himself  was then absent  but   our hero happening to be there  Vindex instantly shut the door    and called him to task      Master Harry  says he  did you know any thing of the strange   knocking at my door last Tuesday night   To this question  Harry    who was too valiant to be tempted to tell a lie through fear  with    out hesitation answered in the affirmative  You did  sirrah   replied   the pedagogue   and you have the impudence also to confess it to   my face   Here  Jacky  down with his trousers  and horse him for   me directly      Jack was a lusty lubberly boy  about ten years of age  and   stooping to unbutton Harry  according to order  our hero gave him   such a sudden fist in the mouth  as dashed in two of his teeth that   then happened to be moulting  and set him a crying and bleeding   in a piteous manner  Vindex then rose into tenfold fuiy  and took   our hero in hand himself   and notwithstanding that he cuffed  and   kicked  and fought it most manfully  Vindex at length unbuttoned   his trousers  and set him in due form on the back of his boarder      The pedagogue  at first  gave him the three accustomed strokes v   as hard as he could draw  So much  my friend  says he  is for your   own share of the burden   and now tell me who were your con    federates and abettors in this fine plot  That I will never tell you    deliberately and resolutely answered our hero  What  shall I be   bullied and out braved  replied the frantic savage  by such a one   as you  You little stubborn villain  I will flay you alive  I will   carbonado you on the spot  So saying  he laid at him as though   he had been a sheaf of wheat   while Harry  indignantly  endured   the torture  and holding in his breath that he might not give   Vindex the satisfaction of a groan  he determined to perish rather   than to betray      In the mean time  Ned had peeped in at the keyhole  and spying   the situation and plight of his loved patron  he ran to Mrs  Hannah   and imparted the horrid tidings  Hannah rose with all the wrath   of Tisiphone in her countenance  and flying to the schoolroom  she         64 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      rushed violently against the door  burst it open in a twinkling   and   springing forward  fastened every nail she had in the face and eyes   of Yindex  and tore away and cuifed at a fearful rate  Jack  at   this period  had let his rider to the ground   when Harry  catching   ut a sword that hung against a wainscot  whipped it down  and   drawing it from the sheath as quick as lightning  he sprung at   Vindex  in order to run him through the body  but  happily  not   having had the patience to put up his breeches  they trammelled   him in his advance  and he fell prostrate with the sword in his   hand  which reached the leg of the pedagogue  and gave him a   slight wound just as he was endeavouring to make his way through
