turning to   Horatio  and imagine that the employment I have found you will not be   disagreeable to you   one of the gentlemen of the bed chamber to the   Chevalier St  George being dead  there is a vacancy  which I will make   interest shall be filled by no other than yourself   you seem to be much   of the same age with him  and I dare say he will be extremely pleased in   the choice I make of you to be near him   it is not indeed  added he  a   place of so much advantage as I could wish  but there is a handsome   pension annexed to it  which  with the honour  will  I believe  content   you till something better presents itself       From the first mention the prince made of the post he had found for him    the heart of Horatio leap d in his breast with an agitation he had never   felt before  the thoughts of living at St  Germains in the same palace   with mademoiselle Charlotta so transported him  that he scarce knew what   he said  and the thanks he gave the prince were expressed with such   hyperboles of gratitude  as made his highness think he had a higher idea   of the employment than it indeed deserved  but the baron who knew the   motive  and could not help smiling within himself  to prevent any other   from suspecting it  however  told the prince  that it was not to be   wondered at that he testified so high a satisfaction  since he was now   to serve a family he had by nature a strong attachment to  and at the   same time continue in a country he liked much better than his own       Horatio by this time having a little recovered himself  and sensible he   had gone rather too far  seconded what the baron had said  and no more   observations were made on it       That same evening  the prince having made it his request  was Horatio   permitted to kiss the hand of the Chevalier St  George  and the ensuing   day took possession of the apartment appropriated to the office   bestowed on him       After having received the congratulations of a whole court  who   testified a great deal of satisfaction in having him among them  and   paid his compliments in a particular manner to mademoiselle Charlotta    he took abundance of pleasure in viewing all the apartments of a palace   famous for the birth of one of the greatest monarchs of the age  and for   being the asylum of the distrest royal family of England  when his   attendance on his master gave him leisure  he frequently passed many   hours together in a closet  where he was told the late king James used   to retire every day to pray for the prosperity of that people who had   abjur d him  Young as Horatio was  and gay by nature  he sometimes loved   to indulge the most serious meditations  and this place  as well as the   condition of those he served  remonstrating to him the instability of   all human greatness  he made this general reflection  that there was   nothing truly valuable but virtue  because the owner could be deprived   of that only by himself  and not by either the fraud or force of others       Indeed the behaviour of all the persons who composed this court could   not but inspire those who saw it with sentiments of the nature I have   described  the queen herself  tho  of too great a soul to shew any marks   of repining at her fate  was never seen to smile  even the Chevalier St    George and princess had both of them a very serious air  which denoted   they had reflections more befitting their condition than their years    and those about them being most of them persons who had left the   greatest part of their fortunes as well as kindred either in England    Scotland or Ireland  had their own misfortunes as well as that of the   royal cause to lament  and therefore could not but wear a dejection in   their countenances  in fine  every thing he saw seem d an emblem of   fallen majesty  except on drawing room nights  and then indeed the   splendor of Marli and Versailles shone forth at St  Germains in the   persons of those who came to pay their compliments  among whom were not   only the Dauphine and all the princes of the blood  but even the grand   monarch himself thought it not beneath his dignity to give this proof of   his respect once or twice every week       This way of living  and the company he was now associated with  gave   Horatio a manly way of thinking much sooner than otherwise perhaps he   might have had
