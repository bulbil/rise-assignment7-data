of   persons endued by nature with any perfections which may do honour to   their art  this gentleman was like others of his profession  he found it   to his credit to shew frequently Mr  Trueworth s picture to as many as   came to look over his paintings  and had detained it for several days   beyond the time in which he had promised to send it  on pretence that   there were still some little touches wanting on the drapery       Mr  Trueworth growing a little impatient at the delay  as Miss Harriot   had asked two or three times  in a gay manner  when she should see his   resemblance  went himself in order to fetch it away  the painter was   surprized at the sight of him  and much more so when he demanded the   picture  He told him  however  the whole truth without hesitation  that   he delivered it to a lady not above an hour before he came  who paid him   the money for it  and said that she had called for it on his request       Nothing had ever happened that seemed more strange to him  he made a   particular enquiry concerning the face  age  complexion  shape  stature    and even dress of the lady  who had put this trick upon him  and it was   well for Miss Betsy  that she had taken all the precautions she did  or   she had infallibly been discovered  a thing which  perhaps  would have   given her a more lasting confusion  than even her late unlucky adventure   with the mock baronet       She was  however  among all the ladies of his acquaintance  almost the   only one who never came into his head on this occasion  sometimes he   thought of one  sometimes he thought of another  but on recollecting all   the particulars of their behaviour towards him  could find no reason to   ascribe what had been done to any of them  Miss Flora was the only   person he could imagine capable of such a thing  he found it highly   probable  that her love and invention had furnished her with the means   of committing this innocent fraud  and though he was heartily vexed that   he must be at the trouble of sitting for another picture  yet he could   not be angry with the woman who had occasioned it  on the contrary  he   thought there was something so tender  and so delicate withal  in this   proof of her passion  that it very much enhanced the pity and good will   he before had for her       But while his generous heart was entertaining these too favourable and   kind sentiments of her  she was employing her whole wicked wit to make   him appear the basest of mankind  and also to render him the most   unhappy       She had found out every thing she wanted to know concerning Mr    Trueworth s courtship to Miss Harriot  and flattered herself  that a   lady bred in the country  and unacquainted with the artifices frequently   practised in town  to blacken the fairest characters  would easily be   frightened into a belief of any thing she attempted to inspire her with       In the vile hope  therefore  of accomplishing so detestable a project    she contrived a letter in the following terms             To Miss Harriot Loveit            Madam            Where innocence is about to suffer merely through it s incapacity        of suspecting that ill in another it cannot be guilty of itself         common honesty forbids a stander by to be silent  You are on the        brink of a precipice which  if you fall into  it is not in the        power of human art to save you  Death only can remove you from        misery  remorse  distraction  and woes without a name  Trueworth         that sly deceiver of your sex  and most abandoned of his own  can        only bring you a polluted heart and prostituted vows  He made the        most honourable professions of love to a young lady of family and        character  gained her affections  I hope no more  but  whatever was        between them  he basely quitted her  to mourn her ill placed love        and ruined fame  Yet this  Madam  is but his least of crimes  he        has since practised his betraying arts on another  superior to the
