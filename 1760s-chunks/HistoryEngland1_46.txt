  135 on a stately white charger  remarkable for its furniture and beauty   Two Kings  prisoners in the same court  at the same time  were considered as glorious conquests  but all that England gained by them was only glory  Whatever was acquired in France  with all the splendors of triumph  was successively  and in a manner  silently lost  without even the mortification of a defeat  The treaties that were made with the captive Kings  as may be easily imagined  were highly to the advantage of their conquerors  but those treaties were no longer observed than while the English had it in their power to enforce obedience  It is true  John held to his engagements as far as was in his power  but  by being a prisoner he lost his authority  and his misfortunes rendered him contemptible  Upon his return from captivity  he not only found himself without finances  but at the head of an exhausted state  soldiers without discipline  and peasants without law  One of the chiefs of the banditti  upon this occasion  assumed the title of The Friend of God  and the Enemy of Mankind  A citizen of Sens  called John of Gouge  also got himself  by means of robberies  to be acknowledged King  and caused as many calamities by his devastations  as the real King had caused by his misfortunes  Such was the state of France upon the arrival of John from England  yet  such was the absurdity of this Monarch  that he immediately prepared for a crusade into the Holy Land  before he was scarce replaced on his throne  had his exhausted subjects been able to furnish him out for this chimerical project  it is probable he would have gone through with it  but their miseries were such  as to be even incapable of paying his ransom  upon which he   136 again returned to England  where he died in less than a year  It is said his passion for the Countess of Salisbury was the real cause of this journey  and  indeed  his age  he being near sixty  when men too often indulge this preposterous passion  and the gallantry of the times seem to countenance this opinion   If England  during these shining revolutions  gained any real advantage  it was only that of having a spirit of elegance and honour now diffused through every rank of people  The meanest soldier now began to follow his leader from love  and not compulsion  he was brave from sentiment alone  and had the honour of his country beating at his heart  even though in the humblest station  This was the time when chivalry was at the highest  and all the successes of England  at this period  were owing to a concurrence of circumstances not much regarded by historians    A romantic nation was led on by a romantic King     This spirit of chivalry  in some measure  served to soften the ferocity of the age  it was a mixture of love  generosity  and war  You have already seen  that the sons of Princes and the nobility  instead of being bred to arts  or polished by the sciences  were brought into the field at an early age  and instructed in no other arts  but those of arms   This instruction consisted in little more than merely how to sit on horse back  to wield the lance  to run at the ring  to flourish at a tournament  to fall at the feet of a mistress  and attain such accomplishments as inured their bodies to bear the fatigues of a campaign  The rules of tactics  of incampments  of stratagems  or sortifications  were but little minded by any     137 Charles the Wise  of France  soon therefore  by a finely conducted policy  regained whatever was lost by John  his predecessor  Edward the Black Prince  emaciated by a lingering consumption  died at the palace of Westminster  in the forty sixth year of his age  England began to wear a face of discontent  the public treasure was lavished without any advantage to the kingdom  the subjects laboured under numberless grievances  in short  the kingdom seemed now to feel  that a nation might be at once very victorious and very unhappy  But  to complete their miseries  Edward  their King  was now no longer what he was in the earlier parts of his reign  he was sunk into unmanly indolence  and gave himself up to the enjoyment of loose desire  in the arms of a favourite concubine  called Allice Perrers  His parliament made frequent remonstrances against this base oblivion of himself  the parliaments  at this time  were not as formerly  factions ready to oppress public liberty  but assemblies of wise and good men  sedulous for common welfare  and of wisdom equal to the rectitude of their intentions  they frequently remonstrated against the King s and his ministers conduct  they  at one time  had influence sufficient to get his concubine removed  but he soon took her back  for the passions of age are incurable  In her company he forgot all the burdens  duties  and fatigues of state  and left the kingdom to be plundered by a rapacious ministry  he did not live to survive the consequences
