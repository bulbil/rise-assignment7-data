 You might have doubtless   evaded this attempt by more gentle and less affrontive methods  but that   cursed pride of yours must be gratified  though at the expence of all my   expectations   With these words he flung out of the room  and this was   all the return she met with from her ungrateful husband  for having   resisted  with such courage and resolution  temptations which some women   would have thought themselves absolved for yielding to the force of       Ill natured and perverse as Mr  Munden was  it must be confessed that   his present situation  nevertheless  merited some compassion  he had a   great share of ambition  loved both pleasure and grandeur to an excess    and  though far from being of a generous disposition  the pride and   vanity of his humour made him do many things  through ostentation  which   his estate would not well support  He kept company with persons of rank   and fortune much superior to his own  and  as he bore an equal part in   their expences whenever he was with them  he stood in need of some   addition to his revenue  well  therefore  might he be chagrined at an   accident that cast so dark a cloud over that prospect of interest and   preferment he had flattered himself with from Lord            But though this was the main point  it was not the sole subject of his   discontent  The motives for his being sent by Lord      to Mr  W        the pretended quarrel between them  and the trifling excuses made by the   latter to detain him from making too quick a return  were all too   obvious for him not to be assured that gentleman was privy to  and   agreed to be an assistant in  the design his lordship had upon his wife       Mr  W      though the representative of a borough in C      was  indeed    no more than a creature of Lord       to whose interest alone he was   indebted for his seat in parliament  but it was not because Mr  Munden   knew him to be obliged to do everything enjoined by his lordship  that   restrained the resentment he conceived against him from breaking out    but because he considered that a quarrel between them on this score   might occasion the affair to become publick  and expose both himself and   wife to the ridicule of as many as should hear it       Wrath  when enervate  especially if inflamed by any just provocation  is   certainly very dreadful to be borne  and what this injured husband   sustained in the first emotions of it  must have excited the pity of   every reader of this history  if he had not afterwards meanly vented it   where he had not the least occasion for disgust  but rather of the   highest tenderness and admiration       In the midst of these perplexities  however  let us leave him for a   while  and return to her whose beauty had been the innocent cause of   all this trouble to him  and danger to herself       Wonderful  indeed  were the effects this last adventure produced in her    Many times before she had been on the very verge of ruin  and as often   indebted merely to fortune for her preservation from the mischiefs into   which her inadvertency had almost plunged her  but none of those   dangers  those escapes  had ever been capable of making any lasting   impression on her mind  or fixing her resolution to avoid running again   into the same mistakes       The cruel reproaches and reflections cast on her by Mr  Munden  filled   her not now with the least resentment  for though she deserved them not   upon the score he made them  yet she was conscious that she did so for   going to the house of Lord       after having the strongest reasons to   believe he had dishonourable intentions upon her       She blushed to remember  that she had given herself leave to be pleased   at the thoughts of appearing amiable in the eyes of that great man     Good God   cried she   what infatuation possessed me  Am I not married    Is not all I am the property of Mr  Munden  Is it not highly criminal in   any one to offer to invade his right  And can I be so wicked to take   delight in the guilt to which I am in a manner accessary        The vanities of my virgin state   continued she   might plead some   excuse  but nothing now can be urged in my defence for persevering in
