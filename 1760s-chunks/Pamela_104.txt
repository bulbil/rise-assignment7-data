 I never saw such an one in my life  He has great staring eyes    like the bull s that frightened me so  vast jaw bones sticking out    eyebrows hanging over his eyes  two great scars upon his forehead  and   one on his left cheek  and two large whiskers  and a monstrous wide   mouth  blubber lips  long yellow teeth  and a hideous grin  He wears   his own frightful long hair  tied up in a great black bag  a black crape   neckcloth about a long ugly neck  and his throat sticking out like a   wen  As to the rest  he was dressed well enough  and had a sword on    with a nasty red knot to it  leather garters  buckled below his knees    and a foot  near as long as my arm  I verily think       He said  he fright de lady  and offered to withdraw  but she bid him   not  and I told Mrs  Jewkes  That as she knew I had been crying  she   should not have called me to the gentleman without letting me know he   was there  I soon went up to my closet  for my heart ached all the time   I was at table  not being able to look upon him without horror  and this   brute of a woman  though she saw my distress  before this addition to   it  no doubt did it on purpose to strike more terror into me  And indeed   it had its effect  for when I went to bed  I could think of nothing but   his hideous person  and my master s more hideous actions  and thought   them too well paired  and when I dropt asleep  I dreamed they were both   coming to my bedside  with the worst designs  and I jumped out of my bed   in my sleep  and frightened Mrs  Jewkes  till  waking with the terror  I   told her my dream  and the wicked creature only laughed  and said  All I   feared was but a dream  as well as that  and when it was over  and I was   well awake  I should laugh at it as such          And now I am come to the close of Wednesday  the 27th day of my   distress       Poor Mr  Williams is actually arrested  and carried away to Stamford    So there is an end of all my hopes from him  poor gentleman  His   over security and openness have ruined us both  I was but too well   convinced  that we ought not to have lost a moment s time  but he   was half angry  and thought me too impatient  and then his fatal   confessions  and the detestable artifice of my master   But one might   well think  that he who had so cunningly  and so wickedly  contrived   all his stratagems hitherto  that it was impossible to avoid them  would   stick at nothing to complete them  I fear I shall soon find it so       But one stratagem I have just invented  though a very discouraging one   to think of  because I have neither friends nor money  nor know one step   of the way  if I was out of the house  But let bulls  and bears  and   lions  and tigers  and  what is worse  false  treacherous  deceitful   men  stand in my way  I cannot be in more danger than I am  and I depend   nothing upon his three weeks  for how do I know  now he is in such a   passion  and has already begun his vengeance on poor Mr  Williams  that   he will not change his mind  and come down to Lincolnshire before he   goes to London       My stratagem is this  I will endeavour to get Mrs  Jewkes to go to bed   without me  as she often does  while I sit locked up in my closet  and   as she sleeps very sound in her first sleep  of which she never fails to   give notice by snoring  if I can but then get out between the two bars   of the window   for you know I am very slender  and I find I can get   my head through   then I can drop upon the leads underneath  which   are little more than my height  and which leads are over a little   summer parlour  that juts out towards the garden  and as I am light  I   can easily drop from them  for they are not high from the ground  then I   shall be in the garden  and then  as I have the key of the back door    I will get out  But I have another piece of cunning
