the chamber but by a   slight wainscot  she put her ear close to the pannel  in order to   discover the voices of them who spoke  and found  by some light that   came through a crack or flaw in the boards  her eyes  as well as ears    contributed to a discovery she little expected  In fine  she plainly   perceived Miss Flora and a man rise off the bed  she could not at first   discern who he was  but  on his returning to go out of the room  knew   him to be no other than Gayland  They went out of the chamber together   as gently as they could  and though Miss Betsy might  by taking three   steps  have met them in the passage  and have had an opportunity of   revenging herself on Miss Flora for the late airs she had given herself    by shewing how near she was to the scene of infamy she had been acting    yet the shock she felt herself  on being witness of it  kept her   immoveable for some time  and she suffered them to depart without the   mortification of thinking any one knew of their being together in the   manner they were       This young lady  who though  as I have already taken notice  was of too   volatile and gay a disposition  hated any thing that had the least   tincture of indecency  was so much disconcerted at the discovery she had   made  that she had not power to stir from the place she was in  much   less to resolve how to behave in this affair  that is  whether it would   be best  or not  to let Miss Flora know she was in the secret of her   shame  or to suffer her to think herself secure       She was however  beginning to meditate on this point  when she heard   Miss Flora come up stairs  calling at every step   Miss Betsy  Miss   Betsy  where are you   Gayland was gone  and his young mistress being   told Miss Betsy was come home  guessed it was she who had given an   interruption to their pleasures  by coming to the door  she  therefore    as she could not imagine her so perfectly convinced  contrived to   disguise the whole  and worst of the truth  by revealing a part of it    and as soon as she had found her   Lord  Miss Betsy   cried she  with   an unparalleled assurance   where have you been  how do you think I have   been served by that cursed toad Gayland  He came up into our chamber    where the mantua maker and I were  and as soon as she was gone  locked   the door  and began to kiss and touze me so  that I protest I was   frighted almost out of my wits  The devil meant no harm  though  I   believe  for I got rid of him easy enough  but I wish you had rapped   heartily at the door  and obliged him to open it  that we both might   have rated him for his impudence    Some people have a great deal of   impudence  indeed   replied Miss Betsy  astonished at her manner of   bearing it off   Aye  so they have  my dear   rejoined the other  with a   careless air   but  pr ythee  where have you been rambling by   yourself     No farther than Bedford Street   answered Miss Betsy   you   may see on what errand   continued she  pointing to the silks which she   had laid down on a chair  Miss Flora presently ran to the bundle    examined what it contained  and either being in a better humour  or   affecting to be so  than when they talked on this head in the parlour    testified no disapprobation of what she had done  but  on the contrary    talked to her in such soft obliging terms  that Miss Betsy  who had a   great deal of good nature  when not provoked by any thing that seemed an   affront to herself  could not find in her heart to say any thing to give   her confusion       When Lady Mellasin came home  and was informed how Miss Betsy had   behaved  in relation to the silk  she at first put on an air full of   resentment  but finding the other wanted neither wit nor spirit to   defend her own cause  and not caring to break with her  especially as   her daughter was going with her to L    e  soon grew more moderate  and    at length  affected to think no more of it  Certain it is  however  that   this affair  silly as it was
