 6    To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Montreal  July 9   I AM arriv d  my dear  and have brought my heart safe thro  such a continued fire as never poor knight errant was exposed to  waited on at every stage by blooming country girls  full of spirit and coquetry  without any of the village bashfulness of England  and dressed like the shepherdesses of romance  A man of adventure might make a pleasant journey to Montreal       The peasants are ignorant  lazy  dirty  and stupid beyond all belief  but hospitable  courteous  civil  and  what is particularly agreeable  they leave their wives and daughters to do the honors of the house  in which obliging office they acquit themselves with an attention  which  amidst every inconvenience apparent  tho  I am told not real  poverty can cause  must please every guest who has a soul inclin d to be pleas d  for my part  I was charm d with them  and eat my homely fare with as much pleasure as if I had been feasting on ortolans in a palace  Their conversation is lively and amusing  all the little knowledge of Canada is confined to the sex  very few  even of the seigneurs  being able to write their own names      The road from Quebec to Montreal is almost a continued street  the villages being numerous  and so extended along the banks of the river St  Lawrence as to leave scarce a space without houses in view  except where here or there a river  a wood  or mountain intervenes  as if to give a more pleasing variety to the scene  I don t remember ever having had a more agreeable journey  the fine prospects of the day so enliven d by the gay chat of the evening  that I was really sorry when I approach d Montreal      The island of Montreal  on which the town stands  is a very lovely spot  highly cultivated  and tho  less wild and magnificent  more smiling than the country round Quebec  the ladies  who seem to make pleasure their only business  and most of whom I have seen this morning driving about the town in calashes  and making what they call  the tour de la ville  attended by English officers  seem generally handsome  and have an air of sprightliness with which I am charm d  I must be acquainted with them all  for tho  my stay is to be short  I see no reason why it should be dull  I am told they are fond of little rural balls in the country  and intend to give one as soon as I have paid my respects in form   Six in the evening       I am just come from dining with the — regiment  and find I have a visit to pay I was not aware of  to two English ladies who are a few miles out of town  one of them is wife to the major of the regiment  and the other just going to be married to a captain in it  Sir George Clayton  a young handsome baronet  just come to his title and a very fine estate  by the death of a distant relation  he is at present at New York  and I am told they are to be married as soon as he comes back   Eight o clock       I have been making some flying visits to the French ladies  tho  I have not seen many beauties  yet in general the women are handsome  their manner is easy and obliging  they make the most of their charms by their vivacity  and I certainly cannot be displeas d with their extreme partiality for the English officers  their own men  who indeed are not very attractive  have not the least chance for any share in their good graces   Thursday morning       I am just setting out with a friend for Major Melmoth s  to pay my compliments to the two ladies  I have no relish for this visit  I hate misses that are going to be married  they are always so full of the dear man  that they have not common civility to other people  I am told however both the ladies are agreeable   14th  Eight in the evening       Agreeable  Lucy  she is an angel   tis happy for me she is engag d  nothing else could secure my heart  of which you know I am very tenacious  only think of finding beauty  delicacy  sensibility  all that can charm in woman  hid in a wood in Canada       You say I am given to be enthusiastic in my approbations  but she is really charming  I am resolv d not only to have a friendship for her myself  but that you shall  and have told her so  she comes to England as soon as she is married  you are form d to love each other       But I must tell you  Major Melmoth kept us a week at his house in the country  in one continued round of rural amusements  by which I do not mean hunting and shooting  but such pleasures as the ladies could share  little rustic balls and parties round the neighbouring country
