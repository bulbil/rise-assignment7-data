     As the words of HAMET struck ALMORAN with terror  and over awed him by   an influence which he could not surmount  HAMET was forced from his   presence  before any other orders had been given about him  than were   implied in the menace that was addressed to ALMEIDA  no violence    therefore  was yet offered him  but he was secured  till the king s   pleasure should be known  in a dungeon not far from the palace  to which   he was conducted by a subterraneous passage  and the door being closed   upon him  he was left in silence  darkness  and solitude  such as may be   imagined before the voice of the Almighty produced light and life       When ALMORAN was sufficiently recollected to consider his situation  he   despaired of prevailing upon ALMEIDA to gratify his wishes  till her   attachment to HAMET was irreparably broken  and he  therefore  resolved   to put him to death  With this view  he repeated the signal  which   convened the ministers of death to his presence  but the sound was lost   in a peal of thunder that instantly followed it  and the Genius  from   whom he received the talisman  again stood before him        ALMORAN   said the Genius   I am now compelled into thy presence by the   command of a superior power  whom  if I should dare to disobey  the   energy of his will might drive me  in a moment  beyond the limits of   nature and the reach of thought  to spend eternity alone  without   comfort  and without hope    And what   said ALMORAN   is the will of   this mighty and tremendous being    His will   said the Genius   I will   reveal to thee  Hitherto  thou hast been enabled to lift the rod of   adversity against thy brother  by powers which nature has not entrusted   to man  as these powers  and these only  have put him into thy hand    thou art forbidden to lift it against his life  if thou hadst prevailed   against him by thy own power  thy own power would not have been   restrained  to afflict him thou art still free  but thou art not   permitted to destroy  At the moment  in which thou shalt conceive a   thought to cut him off by violence  the punishment of thy disobedience   shall commence  and the pangs of death shall be upon thee    If then     said ALMORAN   this awful power is the friend of HAMET  what yet   remains  in the stores of thy wisdom  for me   Till he dies  I am at   once precluded from peace  and safety  and enjoyment    Look up   said   the Genius   for the iron hand of despair is not yet upon thee  Thou   canst be happy  only by his death  and his life thou art forbidden to   take away  yet mayst thou still arm him against himself  and if he dies   by his own hand  thy wishes will be full    O name   said ALMORAN   but   the means  and it shall this moment be accomplished    Select   said the   Genius   some friend         At the name of friend  ALMORAN started and looked round in despair  He   recollected the perfidy of Osmyn  and he suspected that  from the same   cause  all were perfidious   While HAMET has yet life   said he   I   fear the face of man  as of a savage that is prowling for his prey      Relinquish not yet thy hopes   said the Genius   for one  in whom thou   wilt joyfully confide  may be found  Let him secretly obtain admittance   to HAMET  as if by stealth  let him profess an abhorrence of thy reign    and compassion for his misfortunes  let him pretend that the rack is   even now preparing for him  that death is inevitable  but that torment   may be avoided  let him then give him a poignard  as the instrument of   deliverance  and  perhaps  his own hand may strike the blow  that shall   give thee peace    But who   said ALMORAN  shall go upon this important   errand    Who   replied the Genius  but thyself  Hast thou not the   power to assume the form of whomsoever thou wouldst have sent    I would   have sent Osmyn   said ALMORAN   but that I know him to be a traitor      Let the form of Osmyn then   said the Genius   be thine  The shadows of   the
