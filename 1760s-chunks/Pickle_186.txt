Scheme at Bath  by which a whole Company of Sharpers  is ruined   On the evening after their arrival at Bath  Godfrey  who had kept  himself up all day for that purpose  went in boots to the billiard  table  and  two gentlemen being at play  began to bet with so little  appearance of judgment  that one of the adventurers then present was    6 22 15  3 45 PM   inflamed with a desire of profiting by his inexperience  and  when the  table was vacant  invited him to take a game for amusement  The soldier   assuming the air of a self conceited dupe  answered  that he did not  choose to throw away his time for nothing  but  if he pleased  would  piddle for a crown a game  This declaration was very agreeable to  the other  who wanted to be further confirmed in the opinion he  had conceived of the stranger  before he would play for anything of  consequence  The party being accepted  Gauntlet put off his coat   and  beginning with seeming eagerness  won the first game  because his  antagonist kept up his play with a view of encouraging him to wager  a greater sum  The soldier purposely bit at the hook  the stakes  were doubled  and he was again victorious  by the permission of his  competitor  He now began to yawn  and observing  that it was not worth  his while to proceed in such a childish manner  the other swore  in  an affected passion  that he would play him for twenty guineas  The  proposal being embraced  through the connivance of Godfrey  the money  was won by the sharper  who exerted his dexterity to the utmost  fearing  that otherwise his adversary would decline continuing the game   Godfrey thus conquered  pretended to lose his temper  cursed his own  ill luck  swore that the table had a cast  and that the balls did not  run true  changed his mast  and with great warmth  challenged his enemy  to double the sum  The gamester  who feigned reluctance  complied with  his desire  and having got the two first hazards  offered to lay one  hundred guineas to fifty on the game  The odds were taken  and Godfrey  having allowed himself to be overcome  began to rage with great  violence  broke the mast to pieces  threw the balls out of the window   and  in the fury of his indignation  defied his antagonist to meet him  tomorrow  when he should be refreshed from the fatigue of travelling   This was a very welcome invitation to the gamester  who  imagining that  the soldier would turn out a most beneficial prize  assured him  that  he would not fail to be there next forenoon  in order to give him his  revenge   Gauntlet went home to his lodgings  fully certified of his own  superiority  and took his measures with Peregrine  touching the  prosecution of their scheme  while his opponent made a report of his  success to the brethren of the gang  who resolved to be present at the  decision of the match  with a view of taking advantage of the stranger s  passionate disposition   Affairs being thus concerted on both sides  the players met  according  to appointment  and the room was immediately filled with spectators   who either came thither by accident  curiosity  or design  The match  was fixed for one hundred pounds a game  the principals chose their  instruments  and laid aside their coats  and one of the knights of the  order proffered to lay another hundred on the head of his associate   Godfrey took him upon the instant  A second worthy of the same class   seeing him so eager  challenged him to treble the sum  and his proposal  met with the same reception  to the astonishment of the company  whose  expectation was raised to a very interesting pitch  The game was begun   and the soldier having lost the first hazard  the odds were offered by  the confederacy with great vociferation  but nobody would run such a  risk in favour of a person who was utterly unknown  The sharper having  gained the second also  the noise increased to a surprising clamour  not  only of the gang  but likewise of almost all the spectators  who desired  to lay two to one against the brother of Emilia     6 22 15  3 45 PM   Peregrine  who was present  perceiving the cupidity of the association  sufficiently inflamed  all of a sudden opened his mouth  and answered  their bets  to the amount of twelve hundred pounds  which were  immediately deposited  on both sides  in money and notes  so that this  was  perhaps  the most important game that ever was played at billiards   Gauntlet seeing the agreement settled  struck his antagonist s ball  into the pocket in a twinkling  though it was in one of those situations  which are supposed to be against the striker  The betters were a little  discomposed at this event
