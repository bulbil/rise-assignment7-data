be free to quit her in case any offer happened of waiting upon a lady    This was consented to by the other  who told her  that since she had   that design  she could no where be so likely to succeed as at her house    which was very much frequented by the greatest ladies in the kingdom    she having the most Curiosities of any woman of her trade  which they   came there to raffle for       On this Louisa took leave of her kind landlady  who having taken a great   fancy to her  and believing it would be for her advantage  was not sorry   to part with her  A quite new scene of life now presented itself to   her   she found indeed the milliner had not made a vain boast  for her   house was a kind of rendezvous  where all the young and gay of both   sexes daily resorted   It was here the marquis of W    r lost his heart    for a time  to the fine mrs  S    ge   here  that the duke of G    n   first declared his amorous inclinations for mrs  C    r   here  that the   seemingly virtuous lady B    n received the addresses of that agreeable   rover mr  D    n   here  that the beautiful dutchess of M     gave that   encouragement  which all the world had sighed for  to the more fortunate   than constant mr  C      in fine  it might properly enough be called the   theatre of gallantry  where love and wit joined to display their several   talents either in real or pretended passions       Louisa usually sat at work in a back parlor behind that where the   company were  but into which some of them often retired to talk to each   other with more freedom       This gave her an opportunity of seeing in what manner too many of the   great world passed their time  and how small regard some of them pay to   the marriage vow  everyday presented her with examples of husbands  who   behaved with no more than a cold civility to their own wives  and   carried the fervor of their addresses to those of other men  and of   wives who seemed rather to glory in  than be ashamed of a train of   admirers  How senseless would these people think me  said she to   herself  did they know I chose rather to work for my bread in mean   obscurity  than yield to marry where I could not love   Tenderness    mutual affection  and constancy  I find  are things not thought   requisite to the happiness of a wedded state  and interest and   convenience alone consulted  Yet was she far from repenting having   rejected Dorilaus  or being in the lead influenced by the example of   others   The adventures she was witness of made her  indeed  more   knowing of the world  but were far from corrupting those excellent   morals she had received from nature  and had been so well improved by a   strict education  that she not only loved virtue for its own sake  but   despised and hated vice  tho  disguised under the most specious   pretences       Her youth  beauty  and a certain sprightliness in her air  was too   engaging to be in the house of such a woman as mrs  C    ge   for so   this court milliner was called  without being very much taken notice of    and tho  most of the gentlemen who came there had some particular object   in view  yet that did not hinder them from saying soft things to the   pretty Louisa as often as they had opportunity  Among the number of   those who pretended to admire her was mr  B    n  afterwards lord F    h    but his addresses were so far from making any impression on her in   favour of his person or suit  that the one was wholly indifferent to   her  and the other so distasteful  that to avoid being persecuted with   it  she entreated mrs  C    ge to permit her to work above stairs  that   she might be out of the way of all such solicitations for the future    either from him or any other  This request was easily complied with  and   the rather because she  who knew not the strength of her journey woman s   resolution  nor the principles she had been bred in  was sometimes in   fear of losing so great a help to her business  by the temptations that   might be offered in a place so much exposed to sight  Mr  B    n no
