 The agitations of her mind would not suffer her to take one moment of   repose for the whole night  nor did the morning afford any more   tranquillity  the disturbance of her heart flew up into her head  and   occasioned so violent a pain there  that she was as unable as unwilling   to get out of bed  She lay till some hours after the time in which they   usually breakfasted  nor would take any refreshment  though the tea was   brought to her bedside  Amongst the crowd of tormenting ideas  the   remembrance that she owed all the vexation she laboured under entirely   to the acquaintance she had with Miss Forward  came strong into her   thoughts  and she had not rose the whole day  if not moved to it by the   impatience of venting her spleen on that unfortunate woman  which she   did  in a letter to her  containing these lines             To Miss Forward            I am sorry that the compassion  which your feigned contrition for        one false step obliged me to take in your misfortunes  should make        you imagine I would continue any conversation with you  after        knowing you had abandoned yourself to a course of life  which I        blush to think any of my sex can descend to brook the thoughts of         much more to be guilty of  If you had retained the least spark of        generosity or good will towards me  you would rather have avoided        than coveted my company  as you must be sensible  that to be seen        with you must render me in some measure a partaker of your infamy         though wholly innocent of your crimes  How base  how cruel  is such        behaviour  especially to one  who had a real regard for you  even        after you had confessed yourself unworthy of it  But I have been        often told  and now I find the observation just  that women of your        wretched principles  being lost to all hope of happiness        themselves  take a malicious pleasure in endeavouring to destroy it        in others            But  for Heaven s sake  what could induce you to desire a        continuation of a correspondence with me  What did you take me for         Did you imagine me so blind as not to see into the shameful means        by which you are supported  or so weak as to forfeit all the        reputation and respect I have in the world  merely to comply with        your request  No  your conduct is too bare faced to give me even        the shadow of an excuse for ever seeing you again  do not         therefore  go about to varnish over actions  whose foulness will        appear through all the colours you can daub them with  The        friendship I once had for you has already pleaded all that yourself        could urge in your defence  but the cause is too bad  and I must        leave you to the miseries which attend remorse  and which a little        time will infallibly bring on  Heavens  to be a common prostitute         to earn precarious bread  by being the slave of every man s        licentious will  What is digging in the mines  What is begging         What is starving  when compared to this  But the idea is too        shocking  modesty shudders at it  I shall drive both that and you        as distant from my thoughts as possible  so  be assured  this is        the last time you will ever hear from the much deceived  and        ill treated            B  THOUGHTLESS        She was going to seal up the above letter  when a sudden thought coming   into her head  she added  to what she had already wrote  this   postscript             P S  You may perhaps be instigated
