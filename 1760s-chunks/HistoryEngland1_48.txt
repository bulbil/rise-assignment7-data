 when the King s Knight delivered the royal message    141 without alighting  not imagining he should stand upon ceremony  but this haughty demagogue  whose pride began to rise with his exaltation  was so offended at this want of respect  that he was going to kill him  if the King  who was himself advancing  had not ordered him to dismount  In Wat Tyler s conference with the King  being both on horseback  he made several proposals  which  though censured by historians as extravagant  in reality breathe nothing but common justice  He desired that all slaves should be set free  and that all commonages should be open to the poor as well as the rich  whilst he made these demands  he now and then lifted up his sword  in a menacing manner  which insolence so raised the indignation of William Walworth  mayor of London  who attended the King  that  without considering to what danger he exposed his master  he stunned Tyler with a blow of his mace  and Sir Philpot  riding up  thrust his sword through his body  his followers  seeing their leader on the ground  encouraged each other to revenge his death  and their bows were now bent for execution  when Richard  though not quite sixteen years of age  instead of flying  rode up to the rebels  with admirable constancy and presence of mind  crying out with a resolute voice    What  my lieges  will you then kill your King  Be not concerned for the loss of your leader  I myself will now be your general  follow me into the field  and you shall have whatever you desire     The rebels immediately desisted  they followed the King  as if mechanically  and the next day received a charter of freedom and a general pardon  But these were only extorted grants  they were soon retracted  the ring leaders of the rebellion   142 were tried  convicted of treason  and executed without mercy  The insurrections of the barons against their King  historians talk of with no great degree of animosity  the insurrection of the plebeians against the barons  in the present case  is branded with all the virulence of reproach  The punishment of the insurgent barons  is generally styled cruelty  the punishment of men who fought for native freedom  is called justice  but  we must be contented with such misrepresentations of facts  till philosophers can be found to write history   We now see the first wrong step in Richard s conduct  He granted the rebels a charter  by which he gave the sanction of justice to their claims  but soon revoked this charter  which was apparently denying that justice they demanded  By these means he dissipated  indeed  the combination for that time  but their hatred remained  and was propagated by the severity of punishment   By this means Richard had effectually alienated the affections of the lower orders of people  it now only remained to make the parliament his enemies  Being come to his seventeenth year  he began more plainly to discover his inclinations  which had hitherto been restrained by the authority of his governors  he had been bred up amidst flatterers  who never ventured to controul his will  he had seen the liberties taken by Edward III  over his subjects  and he fancied he might imitate him in them  but Richard was not the conqueror of France and Scotland  he was hated by the poor  and envied by three guardians of great power  who secretly desired his crown  every error  therefore  in the conduct of a King  so situated  must be attended with dangerous and violent effects  his indolence in repressing the invafions of the   143 Scotch  and the machinations of France  were sufficient to give disgust to his conduct  All his faults were exaggerated  and his behaviour  even when right  publicly reproved  Unaccustomed to controul  he laid a scheme of becoming absolute  and governing without his parliament s assistance or advice  Willing  however  to colour his arbitrary proceeding with the appearance of justice  he asked the opinion of the Judges  their opinions have been too often found to be influenced by interest  they gave it as their opinion  that the King was above law  Yet perhaps they might have been directed by ancient laws  but custom had introduced new modes of thinking  and they did not pay a just deference to her power  This sentence the Lords opposed by declarations  and  offering various reasons  were quickly at the head of forty thousand men to second their arguments  but  what had still greater weight  they threatened to chuse a new King  which so operated upon the King s natural pusillanimity  that he consented to change his favourite ministers  who had advised him to extend the royal prerogative  he renewed his coronation oath  and the same formalities were used as at the commencement of a new reign   We have seen numberless of these insurrections without any apparent consequence  the King circumscribed in one reign  and permitted to range at liberty in another  the only secret  at that time  for a King to become despotic  was to be ever in the field  a warlike Prince might command the nobility  as
