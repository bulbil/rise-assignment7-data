and this being denied  declared war against him  according to the practice of all civilized nations  but even this measure failed of obtaining that approbation for which it was taken  The monster  tutored by Taycho and his ministers  exclaimed  that the golden opportunity was lost  inasmuch as  during the observance of those useless forms  the treasures of Corea were safely brought home to that kingdom  treasures which  had they been interrupted by the Fune of Japan  would have payed off the debts of the nation  and enabled the inhabitants of Meaco to pave their streets with silver  By the bye  this treasure existed no where but in the fiction of Taycho and the imagination of the blatant beast  which never attempted to use the evidence of sense   109 on reason to examine any assertion  how absurd and improbable soever it might be  which proceeded from the mouth of the Orator   Yak strot  having now taken upon himself the task of steering the political bark  resolved to shew the Japonese  that altho  he recommended peace  he was as well qualified as his predecessor for conducting the war  He therefore  with the assistance of the Fatzman  projected three naval enterprizes  the first against Thin quo  the conquest of which had been unsuccessfully attempted by Taycho  the second was destined for the reduction of Fan yah  one of the most considerable settlements belonging to the king of Corea  in the Indian ocean  and the third armament was sent to plunder and destroy a flourishing colony called Lli nam  which the same prince had established almost as far to the southward as the Terra   110 Australis Incognita  Now the only merit which either Yak strot  or any other minister could justly claim from the success of such expeditions  is that of adopting the most feasible of those schemes which are presented by different projectors  and of appointing such commanders as are capable of conducting them with vigour and sagacity   The next step which the favourite took was to provide a help mate for the young Dairo  and a certain Tartar princess of the religion of Bupo  being pitched upon for this purpose  was formally demanded  brought over to Niphon  espoused by Gio gio  and installed empress with the usual solemnities  But  lest the choice of a Tartarian princess should subject the Dairo to the imputation of inheriting his predecessor s predilection for the land of Yesso  which had given such sensible umbrage to all the sensible   111 Japonese who made use of their own reason  he determined to detach his master gradually from those continental connexions  which had been the source of such enormous expence  and such continual vexation to the empire of Japan  In these sentiments  he with held the annual tribute which had been lately payed to Brut an tiffi  by which means he saved a very considerable sum to the nation  and  at the same time  rescued it from the infamy of such a disgraceful imposition —He expected the thanks of the public for this exertion of his influence in favour of his country  but he reckoned without his host  What he flattered himself would yield him an abundant harvest of honour and applause  produced nothing but odium and reproach  as we shall see in the sequel   These measures  pursued with an eye to the advantage of the public    112 which seemed to argue a considerable share of spirit and capacity  were strangely chequered with others of a more domestic nature  which savoured strongly of childish vanity  rash ambition  littleness of mind  and lack of understanding  He purchased a vast ward robe of tawdry cloaths  and fluttered in all the finery of Japan  he prevailed upon his master to vest him with the badges and trappings of all the honorary institutions of the empire  altho  this multiplication of orders in the person of one man  was altogether without precedent or prescription  This was only setting himself up as the more conspicuous mark for envy and detraction   Not contented with engrossing the personal favour and confidence of his sovereign  and  in effect  directing the whole machine of government  he thought his fortune still imperfect  while the treasure of the empire passed   113 through the hands of the Cuboy  enabling that minister to maintain a very extensive influence  which might one day interfere with his own  He therefore employed all his invention  together with that of his friends  to find out some specious pretext for removing the old Cuboy from his office  and in a little time accident afforded what all their intrigues had not been able to procure   Ever since the demise of Got hama baba  poor Fika kaka had been subject to a new set of vagaries  The death of his old master gave him a rude shock  then the new Dairo encroached upon his province  by preferring a Bonze without his consent or knowledge  finally  he was prevented by the express order of Gio gio from touching a certain sum out of the treasury  which he had been accustomed to throw out of his windows at stated peperiods    114 in order to keep up an interest among the dregs of the people  All these mortifications had an effect upon the weak brain of the Cuboy  He began to loath his usual food  and sometimes even declined shewing himself
