 And then Clementina looking down  a blush overspreading her face  and standing Page  87 motionless  as if considering of something—What is in my child s thoughts  said the Marchioness  taking her hand  What is my Love thinking of   Why  madam  in a low  but audible voice  I should be glad to talk with the Chevalier alone  methinks  He is a good man  But if you think I ought not  I will not desire it  In every thing I will be governed by you  Yet I am ashamed  What can I have to say  that my mother may not hear —Nothing  nothing  Your Clementina s heart  madam  is a part of yours   My Love shall be indulged in every thing  You and I  Camilla  will retire—Clementina was silent  and both withdrew   She commanded me to sit down by her  I obeyed  It was not  in the situation I was in  for me to speak first  I attended her pleasure in silence   She seemed at a loss  She looked round her  then at me  then on the floor  I could not then forbear speaking   The mind of Lady Clementina  said I  seems to have something upon it  that she wishes to communicate  You have not  madam  a more sincere  a more faithful friend  than the man before you  Your happiness  and that of my Jeronymo  engross all my cares  Honour me with your confidence   I had something to say  I had many questions to ask—But pity me  Sir  my memory is gone  I have lost it all—But this I know  that we are all under obligations to you  which we never can return  And I am uneasy under the sense of them   What  madam  have I done  but answered to the call of friendship  which  in the like situation  not any one of your family but would have obeyed —  This generous way of thinking adds to the obligation  Say but  Sir  in what way we can express our gratitude  in what way I  in particular  can  and I shall be easy  Till we have done it  I never shall   Page  88 And can you  madam  think  that I am not highly rewarded  in the prospect of that success which opens to all our wishes   It may be so in your opinion  But this leaves the debt still heavier upon us   How could I avoid construing the hint in my favour  And yet I did not think the Lady  even had she not had parents in being  had she been absolutely independent  well enough to determine for herself in a situation so delicate  How then could I in honour  all her friends expecting that I should be entirely governed by her motions  as they were resolved to be  take direct advantage of the gratitude which at that instant possessed her noble mind   If  madam  answered I  you will suppose yourselves under obligations to me  and will not be easy till you have acknowleged them  the return must be a family act  Let me refer myself to your father  mother  brothers  and to yourself  What you and they determine upon must be right   After a short silence—Well  Sir  I believe you have put the matter upon a right footing  But here is my difficulty—You cannot be rewarded  I cannot reward you  But  Sir  the subject begins to be too much for me  I have high notions—My duty to God  and to my parents  my gratitude to you—But I have begun to write down all that has occurred to me on this important subject  I wish to act greatly  You  Sir  have set me the example  I will continue to write down my thoughts  I cannot trust to my memory—No  nor yet to my heart —But no more on a subject that is at present too affecting to me  I will talk to my mother upon it first  but not just now  tho  I will ask for the honour of her presence   She then went from me into the next room  and instantly returned  leading in the Marchioness  Don t  dear madam  be angry with me  I had many things to say to the Chevalier  which I thought I could best Page  89 say  when I was alone with him  but I forget what they were  Indeed  I ought not to remember them  if they were such as I could not say before my mother   My child cannot do any thing that can make me displeased with her  The Chevalier s generosity  and my Clementina s goodness of heart  can neither of them be doubted   O  madam  What a deep sense have I of yours and of my Father s indulgence to me  How shall I requite it —How unworthy should I be of that returning reason  which sometimes seems to enliven my hope  if I were not to resolve  that it shall be wholly employed in my duty to God  and to you both  But even then  my gratitude to that generous man will
