fatal error  as you call it  here is a young person  of fashion  perhaps  I don’t enquire who she is  but she seems to have had no mean education   who is likely to bring a child into the world  to the disgrace of herself and her family  On you  Sir  she charges her dishonour  and mentions your marrying another  as the blow which is to complete her ruin  Mr Faulkland  is not all this truth  Be so good as to give me a direct answer  Madam  I cannot deny it  you have the proof of it in your hands  from all that appears to you  I am indeed very blameable  nay  I do not pretend to vindicate my folly  but  Madam  do not aggravate my fault in your own thoughts  by considering the affair in a more unfavourable light than what even her letter puts it  I conjure you  madam  to suffer Sir George to be my advocate on this occasion  he is acquainted with every particular of the transaction  and can give you a detail that I will not presume to do  Be pleased  Sir  replied I  to tell me what you mean to do in regard to this lady  I mean to do all that I can do  answered he  I shall provide a place of retreat for her  where she will meet with the utmost care  tenderness  and respect  and where she may continue    with privacy till she is in a condition to return home again to her friends  You may be sure  madam  as to the rest  I shall acquit myself consistently with honour  That is as much as to say  Sir  said I  that you will take care of the maintenance of your poor babe  He looked as if he had a mind to smile  forward man  but constrained it  Doubtless  madam  I shall do all that is now in my power to do  in every circumstance relating to her   I felt myself exceedingly displeased with him  I was so disappointed in my opinion of him  that it increased my resentment  Sir  I proceeded  I must inform you  that there is as much now in your power as ever there was  You are still unmarried  the way is open to you  to repair the mischief you have done  I will never bring down the curses of an injured maid upon my daughter’s head  nor purchase her worldly prosperity at the expence of the shame and sorrow of another woman  for ought I know  as well born  as tenderly bred  and  till she knew you  perhaps as innocent as herself  For heaven’s sake  madam  he cry’d  don’t  don’t  I beseech you  pronounce my fate so hastily—You must pardon me  Sir  said I  if I beg to hear no more on this subject  Sir George has already said every thing you could expect of your friend to say in your justification  and more than became him to utter  All I can find by either you or him  is  that you think the loss of honour to a young woman is a trifle  which a man is not obliged to repair  because truly he did not promise to do so  This young creature  I understand  is a gentlewoman  very charming in her person  by your own account  one who loves you tenderly  and will shortly make you a father  Is not all this so  I grant it madam  said the criminal  Then  Sir  what reason can you urge in your conscience for not doing her justice  None—but your own inconstant inclinations  which happen now to be better pleased with another woman  whom  perhaps  you might forsake in a few months   I cannot pretend to repeat to you all he said upon this last article  worse of course  you may be sure  He intreated  over and over again  that I would permit Sir George to plead for him  I told him  that after the facts he had granted  it was impossible that either he or Sir George could make the affair better  that I was very sorry to find myself disappointed in a person of whom I had conceived so high an opinion  and added  that as your illness made it very improper to let you know any thing of the matter for the present  I should take it as a favour if he would permit me to retain the lady’s letter to him for a few days  or till you were in a condition to have the matter broke to    you  In the mean while  I requested that he would dispense with my receiving any more visits from him   He said some frantic things  for the man seems of a violent temper   but finding me peremptory  took his leave with respect   I understand from Sir George  that he flew directly down to Richmond  to a little house he has there  where he has remained ever since  but sends every day to enquire after your health  Sir George  I am sure  sees him often  for he frequently goes out early in the morning  and stays abroad
