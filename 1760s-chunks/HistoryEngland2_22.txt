had begun his fortunes under the command of the late King  and was taken prisoner in his service  Upon the death of his Master he was released from his long confinement to command under Cromwell  for whom he always fought with conduct and success   In this anarchy and confusion he seemed agitated by different designs  between loyalty to his lawful King  ambition to advance himself  and the apprehensions he was under from the governing part of the nation  his loyalty at length prevailed  he resolved to restore the royal family  but to use all the precautions that were requisite for their safety and his own  He soon had an opportunity of embarrassing the affairs of the nation still more  to prepare the way for her meditated revolution  The officers  now formed into a council of ten  had sent to treat with him  he consented to a negotiation only in order to gain time  and after a treaty had been actually   57 signed by those he employed in this business  he refused to ratify it upon frivolous pretences  The deposed parliament  finding that Monck had disapproved of the proceedings of the officers at London  were resolved to avail themselves of his friendship  in order to be reinstated in their former authority  and sent him a private commission  appointing him commander in chief of all the forces in England  Scotland  and Ireland  He now therefore resolved to march towars London  and upon his approach the officers wh had deposed the parliament found themselves almost deserted  and at length compelled to resign the authority they had usurped  When he reached St  Alban s  he sent a letter to the house  desiring that London should be cleared of all other troops to make way for his approach  This demand awakened the suspicion of the parliament  but they were reluctantly obliged to comply  He entered London in triumph at the head of his army  and repaired to the council of state  but refused taking the oath of abjuration  shrewdly observing that the fewer oaths were taken  the cleaner would the consciences be  He next examined his officers  and  having secured their concurrence  he restored those members to the parliament which long since had been secluded before the trial of the King   The Independants  who had voted for the trial of Charles  were now greatly out numbered  and it was soon seen that the royal party was likely to prevail  The republicans  who  though they hated a Protector  still more feared the royal resentment  endeavoured to persuade Monck to assume the sovereign power  in imitation of Cromwell  He rejected their advice  and in the mean time gave the King private intimations of his designs  new modelled the army  quelled an incipient insurrection  and prepared all things for his restoration     58 Nothing now was wanting  but the authority and consent of a free parliament  to settle the fluctuating constitution  On the twenty fifth of April 1660  the new parliament met in both houses  after the manner of their ancestors  They immediately voted that the government ought to be vested in a King  Lords  and Commons  On the eighth of May Charles II  was proclaimed in London  on the twenty sixth he arrived at Dover  on the twenty ninth he reached Whitehall through an innumerable multitude of people  who rent the air with their acclamations  The wretched kingdom  long torn with faction  and oppressed by its own struggles for freedom  once more began to respire  fanaticism  with all its train of melancholy terrors and cruelties  was now dispelled  the arts of peace began to return  but  unhappily  the arts of luxury entered in their train   I am   c   LETTER VIII   IT will undoubtedly astonish posterity  when they find a whole nation making these sudden changes from absolute liberty to the most submissive obedience  at one time almost unanimously declaring against monarchy  and soon after  with the most unbounded flattery  soliciting the shackles of arbitrary power  The parliament  which had before so vehemently opposed the late Monarch  possessed of every virtue  were now profuse in their submissions to his successor  whose character stood in no manner of competition with that of his father   They first ordained to have the bodies of Cromwell  Ireton  and Bradshaw  dug from their graves    59 and dragged to the place of execution  here they continued hanging the whole day  and then were interred under the gallows  Of those who sat in judgment on the late Monarch s trial  some were dead  and some were thought worthy to find pardon  ten only out of fourscore were devoted to immediate destruction  These were enthusiasts  who had all along acted from principle  and bore their fate with all the confidence of martyrs  They had been formerly cruel themselves  and they were now in turn treated with shocking inhumanity  the executioners  not content with performing the office of death  added insult to their tortures  the sufferers  to a man  thanked God for being permitted to die for his cause  and braved the fury of their oppressors with manly contempt   Their deaths seemed to inspire a few desperate enthusiasts with the most strange confidence that ever deluded a poor ignorant party  One Venner
