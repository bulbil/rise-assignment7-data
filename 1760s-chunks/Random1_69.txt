The noise I made alarmed not only the servants  but the company also  who hearing my threats  came forwards to the stair case to see what was the matter  By this time I was seized  disarmed  and with held by two footmen  in this situation I felt the most exquisite torture in beholding my undoer approach with his young wife  I could not endure the sight  was deprived of my senses  and fell into a severe fit  during which I know not how I was treated  but when I recovered the use of reflection  found myself on a bed in a paultry apartment  where I was attended by an old woman  who asked a thousand impertinent questions relating to my condition  and informed me that my behaviour had thrown the whole family into confusion  that Lothario affirmed I was mad  and pretended to have me sent to Bedlam  but my lady persuaded herself there was more in my conduct than he cared should be known  and had taken to her bed on bare suspicion  having first ordered that I should be narrowly looked to —I heard all she said without making any other reply  than desiring she would do me the favour to call a chair  but this  she told me  could not be done without her master s consent  which  however  was easily procured  and I was conveyed to my own lodging in a state of mind that baffles all description  The agitation of my thoughts produced a fever  which brought on a miscarriage  and I believe it is well for my   194 conscience that heaven thus disposed of my burden  for let me own to you with penitence and horror  if I had brought a living child into the world  my frenzy would have prompted me to sacrifice the little innocent to my resentment of the wrongs done me by the father     After this event my rage abated  and my hate became more deliberate and calm  when one day  my landlady informed me that there was a gentleman below who desired to see me  having something of consequence to impart  which he was sure would contribute to my peace of mind —I was exceedingly alarmed at this declaration  which I attempted to interpret a thousand ways  and before I came to any determination he entered my room  with an apology for intruding upon me against my knowledge or consent —I surveyed him some time  but could not remember to have seen him before  then with a faultering accent  demanded what was his business with me —Upon which  he desired I would give him a particular audience  and he did not doubt of communicating something that would conduce to my satisfaction and repose  As I thought myself sufficiently guarded against any violence  I granted his request  and bid the woman withdraw —The stranger then advancing  gave me to understand that he was well acquainted with the particulars of my story  having been informed of them from Lothario s own mouth—that from the time he knew my misfortunes  he had entertained a detestation for the author of them  which had of late been increased and inflamed to a desire of revenge  by a piece of dishonourable conduct towards him—that hearing of my melancholy situation  he had come with an intention of offering his assistance   195 and comfort  and was ready to espouse my quarrel and forthwith take vengeance on my seducer  provided I would grant him one consideration  which  he hoped  I should see no reason to refuse —Had all the artifice of hell been employed in composing a persuasive  it could not have had a more instantaneous or favourable effect than this discourse had upon me —I was transported with a delirium of gloomy joy  I hugged my companion in my arms  and vowed that if he would make good his promise  my soul and body should be at his disposal —The contract was made  he devoted himself to my revenge  undertook to murder Lothario that very night  and to bring me an account of his death before morning —Accordingly  about two of the clock  he was introduced to my chamber  and assured me my perfidious lover was no more  that although he was not entitled to such an honourable proceeding  he had fairly challenged him to the field  where he upbraided him with his treachery towards me  for whom  he told him  his sword was drawn  and after a few passes  left him weltering in his blood —I was so savaged by my wrongs  that I delighted in the recital of this adventure  made him repeat the particulars  feasted my eyes with the blood that remained on his cloaths and sword  and yielded up my body as a recompence for the service he had done me  My imagination was so engrossed by these ideas  that in my sleep I dreamed Lothario appeared before me  pale  mangled and bloody  blamed my rashness  protested his innocence  and pleaded his own cause so pathetically  that I was convinced of his fidelity  and waked in a sit of horror and remorse —My bed fellow endeavoured to soo…  196 console  and persuade me that I had but barely done justice to myself —I dropt asleep again  and the same apparition recurred to my fancy —In short  I passed the night in great misery  and looked upon my avenger with such
