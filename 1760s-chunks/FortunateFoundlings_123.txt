du Plessis  it would have been rather a pleasure to   her  but her mind suffered much more than her body during this   pilgrimage  which she continued in the same manner she had begun till   she reached Leghorn  where a ship lying at anchor  and expecting to sail   in a few days for Marseilles  she agreed to give a small matter for her   passage  the sea faring men not paying altogether so much regard to her   habit  as the land ones had done       No ill accident intervening  the vessel came safely into her desired   port  and Louisa now found herself in the native country of the only   person who engrossed her thoughts  as she had heard him say he was of   Paris  she supposed that the most likely place to hear news of him  but   was in some debate within herself whether she should continue to wear   her pilgrim s habit  or provide herself with other cloaths at   Marseilles  She was weary of this mendicant way of travelling  and could   have been glad to have exchanged it for one more agreeable to the manner   in which she had been accustomed  but then  when she considered how   great a protection the appearance she made  had been from all those   insults  to which a person of her sex and age must otherwise infallibly   have been exposed in travelling alone  she resolved not to throw it off   till she came to the place where she intended to take up her abode  at   least for some time  Young as she was  she had well weighed what course   to take in case du Plessis should either be dead  or  by some accident    removed where she could hear nothing more of him  and all countries and   parts being now equal to her  as she must then be reduced once more to   get her bread by her labour  she doubted not but to find encouragement   for her industry as well in Paris as elsewhere       With this resolution  therefore  after laying one night at Marseilles    she proceeded on her way in the same fashion as she had done ever since   she left Bolognia  and in about six weeks got safely to that great and   opulent city  where she took up her lodging at a hotel  extremely   fatigued  as it is easy to believe  having never even for one day ceased   walking  but while she was on board the ship which brought her to   Marseilles  for the space of eight months  a thing almost incredible    and what perhaps no woman  but herself  would have had courage to   undertake  or resolution to perform  but was  in her circumstances    infinitely the most safe and expedient that prudence could suggest             CHAP  XXIII        Shews by what means Louisa came to the knowledge of her parents  with   other occurrences        The first thing she did on her arrival  was to send for proper persons   to equip her in a manner that she might once more appear herself    resolving that till she could do so  not to be seen in the streets       While these things were preparing  she sent a person  whom the people of   the house recommended to her  to the palace of the prince of Conti  not   doubting but that some of the gentlemen belonging to his highness might   give some intelligence where monsieur du Plessis was to be found  but   the messenger returned without any other information  than that they   knew him very well  but could give no directions in what part he was at   present  he not having been seen in Paris for a long time       It is hard to say whether she most rejoiced or grieved at this account    she imagined that had he been dead they would not have been ignorant of   it  therefore concluded him living to her infinite satisfaction  but   then his absenting himself from the capital of the kingdom  and from the   presence of a prince who had so much loved him  filled her with an   adequate disquiet  as believing some very ill accident must have been   the occasion   she dispatched the same person afterwards to all the   public places that she heard gentlemen frequented  but met not with the   least success in her enquiries  It would prolong this narrative to a   tedious length  should I attempt any description of what she felt in   this situation  or the reflections she made on the odd circumstances of   her life   the greatness of her spirit  and the most perfect resignation   to the divine will  however  made her support even this last and   severest trial with fortitude and patience  and as soon
