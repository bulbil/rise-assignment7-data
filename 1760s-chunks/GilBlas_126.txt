his bride  Advancing up to Enriquez with all the indignation which his fury kindled within him  This is too much  tyrant  cried he  flatter not yourself that I am cowardly enough to bear with this affront  which you have offered to my honour  Ay  traitor  answered the king  standing on his guard  lay aside the vain imagination of being able to compass your purpose with impunity  With these mutual taunts  they entered on a conflict  too violent to be long undecided  The constable  fearing lest Siffredi and his attendants should be roused too soon by the piercing shrieks of Blanche  and should interpose between him and his revenge  took no care of himself  His frenzy robbed him of all skill  He fenced so heedlessly  as to run headlong on his adversary s sword  The weapon entered his body up to the hilt  He fell  and the king instantaneously checked his hand   The daughter of Leontio  touched at her husband s condition  and rising superior to her natural repugnance  threw herself on the ground  and was anxious to afford him every assistance  But that ill fated bridegroom was too deeply prejudiced against her  to allow himself to be softened by the evidences she gave of her sorrow and her pity  Death  whose hand he felt upon him  could not stifle the transports of his jealousy  In these his last moments  no image presented itself to his mind but his rival s success  So insufferable was that idea to him  that  collecting together the little strength he had left  he raised his sword  which he still grasped convulsively  and plunged it deep in Blanche s bosom  Die  said he  as he inflicted the fatal wound  die  faithless bride  since the ties of wedlock were not strong enough to preserve to me the vow which you had sworn upon the altar  And as for you  Enriquez  pursued he  triumph not too loudly on your destinies  You are prevented from taking advantage of my froward fortune  and I die content  Scarcely did these words quiver on his lips  when he breathed his last  His countenance  overcast as it was with the shades of death  had still something in it of fierceness and of terror  That of Blanche presented a quite different aspect  The wound she had received was mortal  She fell on the scarcely breathing body of her husband  and the blood of the innocent victim flowed in the same stream with that of her murderer  who had executed his cruel purpose so suddenly  that the king could not prevent it from taking effect   This ill fated prince uttered a cry at the sight of Blanche as she fell  Pierced deeper than herself by the stab which deprived her of life  he did his utmost to afford the same relief to her as she had offered  though at so fatal an expense  to one who might have rewarded her better  But she addressed him in these words  while the last breath quivered on her lips  My lord  your assiduities are fruitless  I am the victim  Merciless fate demands me  and I resign myself to death  May the anger of heaven be appeased by the sacrifice  and the prosperity of your reign be confirmed  As she was with difficulty uttering these last words  Leontio  drawn thither by the reverberation of her shrieks  came into the room  and  thunderstruck at the dreadful scene before him  remained fixed to the spot where he stood  Blanche  without noticing his presence  went on addressing herself to the king  Farewell  prince  said she  cherish my memory with the tenderness it deserves  My affection and my misfortunes entitle me at least to that  Harbour no aversion to my father  he is innocent  Be a comfort to his remaining days  assuage his grief  acknowledge his fidelity  Above all  convince him of my spotless virtue  With this I charge you  before every other consideration  Farewell  my dear Enriquez         I am dying  Receive my last sigh   Here her words were intercepted by the approach of death  For some time the king maintained a sullen silence  At length he said to Siffredi  whose senses seemed to be locked up in a mortal trance  Behold  Leontio  feed on the contemplation of your own work  In this tragical event  you may ruminate on the issue of your officious cares  and your overweening zeal for my service  The old man returned no answer  so deeply was he penetrated by his affliction  But wherefore dwell on the description of circumstances  when the powers of language must sink under the weight of such a catastrophe  Suffice it to say  that they mutually poured forth their sorrows in the most affecting terms  as soon as their grief allowed them to give vent to its effusions in speech   Through the whole course of his life  the king cherished a tender recollection of his mistress  He could not bring himself to marry Constance  The infant Don Pedro combined with that princess  and by their joint efforts  an obstinate attempt was made to carry the will of Roger into execution  but they were compelled in the end to give way to Prince
