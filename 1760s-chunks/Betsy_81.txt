and only like herself  to go abroad   with a man alone   Miss Betsy regarded not this reproach  but  catching   up her fan and gloves  gave Mr  Trueworth her hand  to lead her where   she had proposed  leaving the other so full of spite  that the tears   gushed from her eyes       It is likely the reader will be pretty much surprized  that Miss Flora    who had always seemed more ready than even Miss Betsy herself  to accept   of invitations of the sort Mr  Trueworth had made  should now  all at   once  become so averse  but his curiosity for an explanation of this   matter must be for a while postponed  others  for which he may be   equally impatient  requiring to be first discussed       Two duels having been agreed upon to be fought on the same morning  the   respect due to the quality of L      demands we should give that   wherein he was concerned  the preference in the repetition       The hour appointed being arrived  Lord      and his brother came into   the field  Mr  Bloomacre and his friend appeared immediately after   You   are the persons   said Lord       in an exulting tone   who made the   invitation  but we are the first at table     It is not yet past the   time   replied Bloomacre  looking on his watch   but the later we come    the more eagerly we shall fall to   In that instant all their swords   were drawn  but they had scarce time to exchange one thrust  before a   posse of constables  with their assistants  armed with staves and clubs    rushed in between them  beat down their weapons  and carried them all   four to the house of the high bailiff of Westminster       That gentleman  by virtue of his office  made a strict examination into   what had passed  and  having heard what both parties had to say    severely reprimanded the one for having given the provocation  and the   other for the manner in which it was resented  he told them he had a   right  in order to preserve the peace of Westminster  and the liberties   of it  to demand  that they should find sureties for their future   behaviour  but  in regard to their quality and character  he would   insist on no more than their own word and honour that the thing should   be mutually forgot  and that nothing of the same kind  which now had   been happily prevented  should hereafter be attempted       Lord      submitted to this injunction with a great deal of readiness    and Mr  Bloomacre  seeing no other remedy  did the same  after which the   high bailiff obliged them to embrace  in token of the sincerity of   their reconciliation       Thus ended an affair which had threatened such terrible consequences  It   made  however  a very great noise  and the discourse upon it was no way   to the advantage of Lord      s character  either for generosity or   courage  Let us now see the sequel of the challenge sent by Mr  Staple   to Mr  Trueworth       These gentlemen met almost at the same time  in the place the challenger   had appointed  few words served to usher in the execution of the fatal   purpose  Mr  Staple only said   Come on  Sir  Love is the word  and Miss   Betsy Thoughtless be the victor s prize   With these words he drew his   sword  Mr  Trueworth also drew his  and  standing on his defence  seeing   the other was about to push  cried   Hold  Sir  your better fortune may   triumph over my life  but never make me yield up my pretensions to that   amiable lady  if I die  I die her martyr  and wish not to live but in   the hope of serving her   These words making Mr  Staple imagine  that   his rival had indeed the greatest encouragement to hope every thing    added to the fury he was before possessed of   Die  then  her martyr     said he  and running upon him with more force than skill  received a   slight wound in his own breast  while aiming to the other s heart       It would be needless to mention all the particulars of this combat  I   shall only say  that the too great eagerness of Mr  Staple  gave the   other an advantage over him  which must have been fatal to him from a   less generous
