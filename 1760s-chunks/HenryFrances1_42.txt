in most Originals  I have ever known  And yet I should even fear a Disappointment in this  had I not  long since  proved the Fallacy of sympathetick   140 Influence  Ixion s Fate  thro  the greatest Part of my Life  has still been mine  but from your last Present  and many other Circumstances of my instant Fortunes  I have Reason to think the Scene is  at length  inverted  and that Shadows alone elude my Grasp  If I am in an Error  I beg you will not undeceive me  for I have taken great Pains to arrive at that Pitch of Philosophy  common to all prudent Mortals  of thinking  that whatever is out of my Reach  is not worth having     Farewel   LETTER LXXXII   BECAUSE I cannot bear to have you remain in a Mistake  even in so trifling a Matter  as any Thing must be  which relates to me  I shall trouble you with a few Remarks upon a late Conversation   You surprized me extremely by saying  that   a Heart  when broken  can with more Ease be divided   and  a broken Looking Glass reflects more Images  than a whole one   are the same Thoughts  Now  I really think  a broken Pitcher is as like either of them  as they are the one to the other  for  having had the   141 Misfortune to be broken  it agrees in the only Circumstance common to them both     Observe that mine is a Thought  Suckling s only a Simile  If there was any Wit in mine  it is owing to itself alone  if there was any in his  it must be owing to the Allusion  for there was certainly none in saying  the Parts of a Thing are more in Number  than the Whole   There was nothing alike even in the Occasions of his Sentiment and mine  He  vile Libertine  meant  I suppose  to apologize for his general Inconstancy  I  like a simple Swain  to assert a double Constancy  Now  the Scope of Suckling s Poem I know not  having never read any of his Works  but what I have met quoted  and  in general  few Persons have read less of polite Authors  than myself  therefore I can only reason upon this Passage  as I received it from you  Let us see then  since the Wit of it is denied  whether we can allow him even common Sense  in this Illustration of his  He tells his Mistress  I suppose  in Excuse for his Inconstancy  that her Cruelty  or his Excess of Love  has torn his tempest beating Heart into so many Pieces  that  like a broken Looking Glass  it reflects more Objects  than when whole  Now I have seen Fragments of Mirrours sometimes  which have indeed reflected my Image   as whatever shews me truly  must  in your Opinion  be a Reflection   but then they   142 only multiplied the Object  not exhibited any new  Therefore  if the Simile had been just  his broken Heart should rather have increased his Constancy  by affording him more Fragments susceptible of her Idea  as one may be said to multiply Life  by dissecting a Worm  because each Part lives  tho   like a broken Heart  it lives in Pain  If indeed she had expressed Surprize  that a wounded Heart should still preserve its Constancy towards the Author of its Destruction  his Simile  tho  even here it would not come up to Wit  might make a pretty Glare among the Faux brilliant   He might say  perhaps  that the Fragments of a Looking Glass may comprehend more Objects than one  but sure a whole one is capable of receiving more  therefore a Man  free from Love  may  and is more susceptible of many Impressions  than one  who has had the Misfortune of a broken Heart   Now the Reason  I apprehend  of your charging me with Plagiary  is this  Suckling you have admired  and  not finding either Sense or Wit in this Passage  you had Reason to conclude they were both stolen  and  as I am a Person  who  in Wit  as well as Fortune  appears to live above my Means  you had Reason to suspect me for the Theft    To be continued  as the Author meets with Encouragement      143  LETTER LXXXIII  HENRY to FRANCES   YOU see my Impatience of writing to you  which does not wait for the Post  and has got the better of a hot  wet Day  bad Paper  Pens  and Ink  and a strong Inclination to sleep  to pay me for last Night s Excess   I hope you all got safe to Town  and found yourselves all safe in Town  I beg to know with what Grace ye were differently accosted by wise Men and Parents  for it is a vast Amusement to me  to hear how innocent Frolicks are treated by sensible  well disposed Christians  who know any Thing better than human Nature  or the World   I recant my Error  my
