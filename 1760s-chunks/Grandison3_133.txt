man   Her uncle treats her with authority  Signor Sebastiano with a pity bordering on contempt   My mother shuns her  and indeed avoids me  But   331 as she has been blamed for permitting the interview  which they suppose the wrongest step that could have been taken  she declares herself neutral  and resigns to whatever will be done by her Lord  by his brother  her two sons  and Ludy Juliana de Sforza  But I am sure  in her heart  that she approves not of the new measures  and which also  as I have reminded the Bishop  so contrary to the advice of the worthy Mrs  Beaumont  to whom they began to think of once more sending my sister  or of prevailing on her to come hither  But Clementina seems not to be desirous of going again to her  we know not why  since she used to speak of her with the highest respect   The dear soul rusned in to me yesterday  Ah  my Jeronymo  said she  they will drive me into despair  They hate me  Jeronymo  But I have written to Somebody —Hush  for your life  hush   She was immediately followed in by her aunt Sforza and her cousin Laurana  and the General  who  however  heard not what she said  but insisted on her returning to her own apartment   What  said she  Must I not speak to Jeronymo  Ah  Jeronymo —I had a great deal to say to you   I raved  but they hurried her out  and have forbid her to visit me  They  however  have had the civility to desire my excuse  They are sure  they say  they are in the right way  And if I will have patience with them for a week  they will change their measures  if they find their new ones ineffectual  But my sister will be lost  irrecoverably lost  I foresee that   Ah Grandison  And can you still—But now they will not accept of your change of religion  Poor Clementina  Unhappy Jeronymo  Unhappy Grandison  I will say  If you are not so  you cannot deserve the affection of a Clementina   But are you the Somebody to whom she has written  Has she written to you  Perhaps you will   332 find some opportunity to morrow to let me know whether she has  or not  Camilla is forbidden to stir out of the house  or to write   The General told me  just now  that my gratitude to you  shewed neither more or less  then the high value I put upon my own life   I answered  That his observation convinced me  that he put a much less upon mine  than I  in the same case should have upon his   He reconciled himself to me by an endearment  He embraced me  Don t say convinced  Jeronymo  I love not myself better than I love my Jeronymo   What can one do with such a man  He does love me   My mother  as I said  is resolved to be neutral  But  it seems  she is always in tears   MY mother stept in just now—To my question after my sister s health  Ah  Jeronymo  said she  All is wrong  The dear creature has been bad ever since yesterday  They are all wrong —But patience and silence  child  You and I have nothing to answer for—Yet my Clementina  said she—Oh  and left me   I have not heart to write on  You will see  from the above  the way we are in  O my Grandison  What will you do among us —I wish you would not come  Yet what hope  if you do not  shall I ever have of seeing again my beloved friend  who has behaved so unexceptionably in a case so critical   You must not think of the dear creature  Her head is ruined  For your own sake  you must not  We are all unworthy of you  Yet  not all  All  however  but Clementina  and  if true friendship will justify my claim to another exception   Your afflicted JERONYMO     333  LETTER XXIX  Miss BYRON   To Miss SELBY    O My Lucy  What think you—But it is easy to guess what you must think  I will  without saying one word more  inclose  Dr  Bartlett s tenth Letter   THE next day   proceeds my patron  I went to make my visit to the family  I had nothing to reproach myself with  and therefore had no other concern upon me but what arose from the unhappiness of the noble Clementina  That indeed was enough  I thought I should have some difficulty to manage my own spirit  if I were to find myself insulted  especially by the General  Soldiers are so apt to value themselves on their knowlege of what  after all  one may call but their trade  that a private gentleman is often thought too slightly of by them  Insolence in a great man  a rich man  or a soldier  is a call upon a man of spirit to exert himself  But I hope
