a little public house on the side of the highway  distinguished by a sign which was said to exhibit the figure of a black lion  The kitchen  in which they assembled  was the only room for entertainment in the house  paved with red bricks  remarkably clean  furnished with three or four Windsor chairs  adorned with shining plates of pewter  and copper saucepans  nicely scoured  that even dazzled the eyes of the beholder  while a cheerful fire of sea coal blazed in the chimney   It would be hard to find a better beginning for a wholesome novel of English life  than these first two sentences in The Adventures of Sir Launcelot Greaves  They are full of comfort and promise  They promise that we shall get rapidly into the story  and so we do  They give us the hope  in which we are not to be disappointed  that we shall see a good deal of those English inns which to this day are delightful in reality  and which to generations of readers  have been delightful in fancy  Truly  English fiction  without its inns  were as much poorer as the English country  without these same hostelries  were less comfortable  For few things in the world has the so called  Anglo Saxon  race more reason to be grateful than for good old English inns  Finally there is a third promise in these opening sentences of Sir Launcelot Greaves   The great northern road   It was that over which the youthful Smollett made his way to London in 1739  it was that over which  less than nine years later  he sent us travelling in company with Random and Strap and the queer people whom they met on their way  And so there is the promise that Smollett  after his departure in Count Fathom from the field of personal experience which erstwhile he cultivated so successfully  has returned to see if the ground will yield him another rich harvest  Though it must be admitted that in Sir Launcelot Greaves his labours were but partially successful  yet the story possesses a good deal of the lively verisimilitude which Fathom lacked  The very first page  as we have seen  shows that its inns are going to be real  So  too  are most of its highway adventures  and also its portion of those prison scenes of which Smollett seems to have been so fond  As for the description of the parliamentary election  it is by no means the least graphic of its kind in the fiction of the last two centuries  The speech of Sir Valentine Quickset  the fox hunting Tory candidate  is excellent  both for its brevity and for its simplicity  Any of his bumpkin audience could understand perfectly his principal points  that he spends his estate of  vive thousand clear  at home in old English hospitality  that he comes of pure old English stock  that he hates all foreigners  not excepting those from Hanover  and that if he is elected  he  will cross the ministry in everything  as in duty bound    In the characters  likewise  though less than in the scenes just spoken of  we recognise something of the old Smollett touch  True  it is not high praise to say of Miss Aurelia Darnel that she is more alive  or rather less lifeless  than Smollett s heroines have been heretofore  Nor can we give great praise to the characterisation of Sir Launcelot  Yet if less substantial than Smollett s roystering heroes  he is more distinct than de Melvil in Fathom  the only one of our author s earlier young men  by the way   with the possible exception of Godfrey Gauntlet  who can stand beside Greaves in never failing to be a gentleman  It is a pity  when Greaves s character is so lovable  and save for his knight errantry  so well conceived  that the image is not more distinct  Crowe is distinct enough  however  though not quite consistently drawn  There is justice in Scott s objection  Tobias Smollett in Biographical and Critical Notices of Eminent Novelists  that nothing in the seaman s  life       renders it at all possible that he should have caught  the baronet s Quixotism  Otherwise  so far from finding fault with the old sailor  we are pleased to see Smollett returning in him to a favourite type  It might be thought that he would have exhausted the possibilities of this type in Bowling and Trunnion and Pipes and Hatchway  In point of fact  Crowe is by no means the equal of the first two of these  And yet  with his heart in the right place  and his application of sea terms to land objects  Captain Samuel Crowe has a good deal of the rough charm of his prototypes  Still more distinct  and among Smollett s personages a more novel figure  is the Captain s nephew  the dapper  verbose  tender hearted lawyer  Tom Clarke  Apart from the inevitable Smollett exaggeration  a better portrait of a softish young attorney could hardly be painted  Nor  in enumerating the characters of Sir Launcelot Greaves who fix themselves in a reader s memory  should Tom s inamorata  Dolly  be forgotten  or the malicious Ferret  or that precious pair  Justice and Mrs  Gobble  or the Knight
