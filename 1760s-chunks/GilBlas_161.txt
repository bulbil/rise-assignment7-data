for the very time being  Accordingly he went his way  for the purpose of giving the necessary orders for the celebration   Though my colleague in knavery was well enough pleased to see Florence s father in a humour so pat for our purposes  he was not without certain scruples of conscience about our safety  It was to be feared  lest the probable proceedings of Pedro might be followed up by awkward consequences  so that he waited impatiently for my arrival  to make me acquainted with what had occur red  I found him over head and ears in a brown study  What is the matter  my friend  said I  seemingly there is something upon your mind  Indeed there is  and something that will be minded  answered he  At the same time he let me into the affair  Now you may judge  added he after a pause  whether we have not some food for reflection  It is your ill star  rash contriver  which has thrown us into this perplexity  The idea  it must he confessed  was full of fire and ingenuity  had it answered in the application  your renown would have been emblazoned in the chronicles of our fraternity  but according to present appearances  the run of luck is against us  and my counsels incline to a prudent avoidance of all explanations  by quietly sneaking off with the market penny we have made of the silly old fellow s credulity   Master Moralez  replied I to this desponding speech  you give way to difficulties with more haste than good speed  Such pusillanimity does but little honour to Don Matthias de Cordel  and the other gallant blades with whom you were affiliated at Toledo  After serving a campaign under such experienced generals  it is not soldierly to shrink from the perils of the field  For my part  I am resolved to fight the battles of these heroes over again  or  in more vulgar phrase  to prove myself a chip from the old blocks  The precipice which makes your head turn giddy only stiffens my sinews to surmount the toils of the way  and push forward to the end of our career  If you arrive at your journey s end in a whole skin  said my companion  I will myself be your biographer  and set your fame far above all the parallels of Plutarch   Just as Moralez was finishing this learned allusion  Jerome de Moyadas came in  You shall be my son in law this very evening  said he  Your servant must have given you an account of what has just passed  What say you to the impudence of the scoundrel who wanted to make me believe that he was the son of my brother s correspondent  Honoured sir  answered I  with a melancholy air  and in a tone of voice the most insinuating that ever cajoled the easy faith of a dotard  I feel within me that it is not in my nature to carry on an imposition without betraying it in my countenance  It now becomes necessary to make you a sincere confession  I am not the son of Juan Velez de la Membrilla  What is it you tell me  interrupted the old man  out of breath with surprise  and out of his wits with apprehension  So then  you are not the young man to whom my brother          For pity s sake  sir  interrupted I in my turn  condescend to give me a hearing patiently to the end of my story  For these eight days have I doted to distraction on your daughter  and this dotage  this distraction  has riveted me to Merida  Yesterday  after having rescued you from your danger  I was making up my mind to ask her of you in marriage  but you gave a check to my passion and put a tie upon my tongue  by the intelligence that she was destined for another  You told me that your brother  on his death bed  enjoined you to give her to Pedro de la Membrilla  that your word was pledged  and that you were the sworn vassal and bondman of your veracity  These circumstances  it must be owned  were overwhelming in the extreme  and my romantic passion  at the last gasp of its despair  gained breath by the stratagem with which the god of love inspired me  I must at the same time declare that a trick is at the best but a mean thing  and  however sanctified by the motive  my conscience recoiled at the delusion  Yet I could not but think that my pardon would be granted on the discovery  when it should come out that I was an Italian prince travelling through this country as a private gentle man  My father reigns supreme over a nest of inaccessible valleys  lying between Switzerland  the Milanese  and Savoy  It could not but occur to me that you would be agreeably surprised when I should unfold to you my birth  and having married Florence under my fictitious character  should announce to her the rank she had attained  with all the rapture of an enamoured husband  and all the stage effect of a hero in tragedy or romance  But heaven  pursued I  with an hypocritical softening down of my accents  has visited my sins by cutting me off
