you say  with Miss Byron  Dear Sir Charles Grandison  oblige me with an audience  of five minutes only  in the back yard  or garden     102 In the evening  Mr  Greville  command me anywhere  But I will not be broken in upon now   I will not leave you at liberty  Sir Charles  to make your visit where you are going  till I am gratified with one five minutes conference with you below   Excuse me then  M  Greville  that I give orders  as if you were not here  Sir Charles ran  Up came one of his servants—Is the chariot ready —Almost ready  was the answer —Make haste  Saunders may see his friends in this neighbourhood  He may stay with them till Monday  Frederick and you attend me   He took out a Letter  and read in it  as he walked about the room  with great composure  not regarding Mr  Greville  who stood swelling  as he owned  at one of the windows  till the servant withdrew  and then he addressed himself to Sir Charles in language of reproach on this contemptuous treatment —Mr  Greville  said Sir Charles  you may be thankful  perhaps  that you are in my own apartment  This intrusion is a very ungentlemanly one   Sir Charles was angry  and expressed impatience to be gone  Mr  Greville owned  that he knew not how to contain himself  to see his rival  with so many advantages in his person and air  dressed avowedly to attend the woman he had so long—Shall I say been troublesome to  For I am sure he had never the shadow of countenance from me   I repeat my demand  Sir Charles  of a conference of five minutes below   You have no right to make any demand upon me  Mr  Greville  If you think you have  the evening will be time enough  But  even then  you must behave more like a gentleman  than you have done hitherto  to intitle youself to be considered as on a foot with me   Not on a foot with you  Sir —And he put his hand upon his sword  A gentleman is on a foot with a Prince  Sir  in a point of honour—    103 Go  then  and find out your prince  Mr  Greville  I am no Prince  And you have as much reason to address yourself to the man you never saw  as to me   His servant just then shewing himself  and withdrawing  Mr  Greville  added he  I leave you in possession of this apartment  Your servant  Sir  In the evening I shall be at your command   One word with you  Sir Charles—One word—  What would Mr  Greville  turning back   Have you made proposals  Are your proposals accepted   I repeat  that you ought to have behaved differently  Mr  Greville  to be intitled to an answer to these questions   Answer me  however  Sir  I beg it as a favour   Sir Charles took out his watch —After Nine  I shall make them wait  But thus I answer you  I have made proposals  and  as I told you before  I hope I shall he accepted   Were you any other man in the world  Sir  the man before you might question your success with a woman whose difficulties are augmented by the obsequiousness of her admirers  But such a man as you  would not have come down on a fool s errand  I love Miss Byron to distraction  I could not shew my face in the county  and suffer any man out of it to carry away such a prize   Out of the county  Mr  Greville  What narrowness is this  But I pity you for your Love of Miss Byron  And—  You pity me  Sir  interrupted he —I bear not such haughty tokens of superiority  Either give up your pretensions to Miss Byron  or make me sensible of it  in the way of a gentleman   Mr  Greville  your servant  And he went down   The wretch followed him  and when they came to the yard  and Sir Charles was stepping into the chariot  he took his hand  several persons present—We   104 are observed  Sir Charles  whispered he  Withdraw with me  for a few moments  By the great God of Heaven  you must not refuse me  I cannot bear that you should go thus triumphantly on the business you are going upon   Sir Charles suffered himself to be led hy the wretch  And when they were come to a private spot  Mr  Greville drew  and demanded Sir Charles to do the like  putting himself in a posture of defence   Sir Charles put his hand on his sword  but drew it not  Mr  Greville  said he  know your own safety  and was turning from him  when the wretch swore he would admit of no alternative  but his giving up his pretensions to Miss Byron   His rage  as Mr  Fenwick describes it from himself  making him dangerous  Sir Charles drew —I only defend myself
