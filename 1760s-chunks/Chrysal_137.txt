        Pray  my lord  proceed   I could hear your lordship for ever    I am always the wiser and the better for hearing your lordship          Then  as to the credit to be given to dreams    resumed his   lordship    though the scepticism of these xmhappy times may   deny it  yet the piety of wiser antiquity was of another opinion  of   which numberless instances might be given out of the holy Sorip    tujes  And among the Gentiles  the greatest of their poets says        Ovap cK dios esi       That is  in English  dreams proceed from Jove â€” that is  from the   Supreme Deity â€” whom they erroneously call by that name  And   though the heathens were guilty of great superstitions in this   particular of dreams  it was not in the credit they gave them  but   in the methods which they used to procure them   such as offering   sacrifices  and sleeping in the skins of the victims  and many others     whereas the dream that comes from Heaven  comes unsought and   unexpected  and should be received with reverence  And if this is   such  and I own it has much of the appearance  Thy will be done    O Lord   Thy servant submits as it is his duty        Greatly as they must have been edified by this elaborate disserta    tion  the ladies had much ado to refrain from laughing in his face   while he delivered it  especially his wife  who knew not which to   admire most  the readiness of the thought  or the ease with which it   was received  But the dreamer had a further scheme in her head    to carry on which she now got up to go away   and  bending the   knee to the bishop    My lord    said she    may I beg your lordship s   blessing   I hope  and I am confident in that hope  that mine   was not a common dream  from the impression it made on my   mind  which could not have been stronger  if I had actually been   present at your lady s kissing the king s hand  on your promotion    But  if my zeal has hurried me too far in my expressions of it  I   rely on your goodness to forgive my fault  which was rather an   enthusiasm than a design   and so  my lord  I beg leave to wish   you a good night        With these words  she withdrew  and her patroness  wondering   she had not thrown her a wink  and desirous to have a laugh with   her at her husband s credulity  went as to see her to her chair     when turning with her into another room    That was an excellent   thought    said she    and will make our affair quite easy if he is   not engaged         I do not imderstand you  madam    replied the other    pray   what thought do you mean           Why  child  that of the dream  What else should I mean           A thought  dear madam   Why  do not you think I was serious    and the dream real   1         146 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA       Not one word of either  I assure you   and I wonder at your   asking me that question here  where no one is present to observe us          Dear madam  you have quite mistaken me  I assure you  It is   true  I can jest sometimes  but in this  give me leave to say that   I was most serious   and what is more  that I am sure the event   will confirm it          You astonish me  madam   I declare  I looked upon the whole   as a mere finesse to promote our scheme about the doctor s living   for your husband          I am sorry  madam  that you should have such an opinion of   me  as that I could invent such a story on any account          Well  as I said before  though in another sense  I know not what   to make of the whole  But  as you are so positive  and my lord   seems inclined to believe you  perhaps there may be more in it than I   can see
