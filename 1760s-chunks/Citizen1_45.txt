you find in a Turk  Persian  or native of Peru  The Chinese are versed in the sciences as well as you  and are masters of several arts unknown to the people of Europe  Many of them are instructed not only in their own national learning  but are perfectly well acquainted with the languages and learning of the west  If my word in such a case  is not to be taken  consult your own travellers on this head  who affirm  that the scholars of Pekin and Siam sustain theological theses in Latin  The college of Masprend  which is but a league from Siam  says one of your travellers   came in a body to salute our ambassador  Nothing gave me more sincere pleasure than to behold a number of priests venerable both from age and modesty  followed by a number of youths of all nations  Chinese  Japonese  Tonquinese  of Cochin China  Pegu and Siam  all willing to pay their re•pects in the most polite manner imaginable  A Cochin Chinese made an excellent Latin oration upon   140 this occasion  he was succeeded  and even out done  by a student of Tonquin  who was as well skilled in the western learning as any scholar of Paris  Now  Sir  if youths  who never stirred from home  are so perfectly skilled in your laws and learning  surely more must be expected from one like me  who have travelled so many thousand miles  who have conversed familiarly for several years with the English factors established at Canton  and the missionaries sent us from every part of Europe  The unaffected of every country nearly resemble each other  and a  of our Confucius and of your Tillotson have scarce any material difference  Paltry affectation  strained allusions  and disgusting finery  are easily attained by those who chuse to wear them  they are but too frequently the badges of ignorance  or of stupidity whenever it would endeavour to please   I was proceeding in my discourse  when  looking round  I perceived the company no way attentive to what I attempted  with so much earnestness  to enforce  One lady was whispering her that sat next  another was studying the merits of a fan  a third began to yawn  and the author himself fell fast asleep  I thought it  therefore  high time to make a retreat  nor did the company seem to shew any regret at my preparations for departure  even the lady who had invited me  with the most mortifying insensibility  saw me seize my hat and rise from my cushion  nor was I invited to repeat my visit  because it was found that I aimed at appearing rather a reasonable creature  than an outlandish ideot  Adieu     141  LETTER XXXIII  To the same   THE polite arts are in this country subject to as many revolutions as its laws or politics  not only the objects of fancy and dress  but even of delicacy and taste are directed by the capricious influence of fashion  I am told there has been a time when poetry was universally encouraged by the great  when men of the first rank not only patronized the poet  but produced the finest models for his imitation  it was then that the English sent forth those glowing rhapsodies  which we have so often read over together with rapture  poems big with all the sublimity of Mentius  and supported by reasoning as strong as that of Zimpo   The nobility are ever fond of wisdom  but they also are fond of having it without study  to read poetry required thought  and the English nobility were not fond of thinking  they soon therefore placed their affections upon music  because in this they might indulge an happy vacancy  and yet still have pretensions to delicacy and taste as before  They soon brought their numerous dependents into an approbation of their pleasures  who in turn led their thousand imitators to feel or feign a similitude of passion  Colonies of singers were now imported from abroad at a vast expence  and it was expected the English would soon be able to set examples to Europe  all these expectations however were soon dissipated  in spite of the zeal which fired the great  the ignorant vulgar refused to be taught to sing  refused to undergo the ceremonies   142 which were to initiate them in the singing fraternity  thus the colony from abroad dwindled by degrees  for they were of themselves unfortunately incapable of propagating the breed   Music having thus lost its splendour  Painting is now become the sole object of fashionable care  the title of connoisseur in that art is at present the safest passport into every fashionable society  a well timed shrug  an admiring attitude  and one or two exotic tones of exclamation are sufficient qualifications for men of low circumstances to curry favour  even some of the young nobility are themselves early instructed in handling the pencil  while their happy parents  big with expectation  foresee the walls of every apartment covered with the manufactures of their posterity   But many of the English are not content with giving all their time to this art at home  some young men of distinction are found to travel thro  Europe with no other intent than that of understanding and collecting pictures  studying seals  and describing statues  on they travel from
