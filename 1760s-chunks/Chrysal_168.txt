for precedency  and she   could not enjoy the honours she had  while she was obliged to give   place to so many      She had formed a variety of schemes to obtain this desired object    but still without success  At length  the very night I came into   her possession  an accident suggested one to her  which she immedi    ately put into execution  with the most sanguine hopes  There   had been a nobleman of the first rank in the company  the weakness   of whose reason had obliged his friends to put him under the govern    ment of a person to whose fidelity they thought they could entrust   so important a charge  As private misfortunes are always an   agreeable topic for public conversation  an elderly lady  who was   acquainted with this nobleman s family  entertained the company   with several melancholy instances of his weakness  My mistress   regarded this only aa it was meant  as common chat  till some time   after  the nobleman  happening to fix his eye with some earnestness   upon her  a sudden thought darted into her mind that  if she could   any way bring about a marriage with him  all her dear views of   ambition would be gratified at once      The moment this thought took possession of her head  it drove   out every other  She lost deal  she revoked  she omitted reckoning   her honours  In short  she was so absent that she was obliged to   pretend a violent headache and leave the company  As soon aa   she got home  she went to bed  where she spent the night in forming   numberless projects for accomplishing her design  But still the   account which the old lady had given of the vigilance of the person   to whose care the nobleman was entrusted disconcerted them all    At length she resolved to attempt corrupting his fidelity  aa she   could not expect to elude his vigilance  She had often heard that   the greatest honesty was not proof against a proper price  and her   knowledge of her own heart did not contradict that opinion  How    ever  not to be too rash  nor betray her design before she had some   prospect of success  she resolved to sound the person before she   applied directly to him      Accordingly  aa soon as she got up  she wrote him an anon3mious   letter  letting him know that a person had a eel tain affair to propose   to him for his concurrence  in which he should receive immediately   a thousand guineas  and an annuity of five hundred pounds a year    besides several other considerable advantages  and that what he was   desired to do could be effected without any possible loss or danger   to himself  This letter she sent by the penny post  and desired the   answer might be returned in the same manner  under a feigned   direction  to the house of a person in whom she confided      Such a letter necessarily surprised the gentleman to whom it         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 185     was sent  Though the greatness of the offer convinced him that   some extraordinary piece of viUany was designed  yet  as he knew   himself above temptation  he resolved to humour the scheme  till   he should discover the whole of it  for the honest revenge of punish    ing a base attempt to seduce him into dishonesty  Accordingly  he   answered the letter directly in such terms as he imagined would   tempt the writer to be more explicit  expressing his readiness to   embrace any proposal that should be so advantageous  when he   should be satisfied that the person who made it was able to perform   it  and worthy of his confidence      This bait took as he desired  My mistress  whose eager imagina    tion was too full of the desired object to let her use any caution    thought her work done  and immediately wrote him another letter    to which she signed her name  and in it explained her whole scheme   of marrjring the nobleman by his assistance  enforcing her former   ofier  by a promise of continuing him in the agency of the estate    or rather  indeed  of sharing it with him  and desiring to meet him   that evening  either at her house  or any other place he pleased  to   confer upon proper means of bringing it into immediate execution      The gentleman was not a moment at a loss how to act on such   an occasion  He immediately waited upon the nobleman  who was   next heir to his unhappy charge  and  showing both the letters    desired his directions how to act  Though this nobleman was   struck with horror at a
