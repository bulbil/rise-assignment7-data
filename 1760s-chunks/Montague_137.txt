in a manner  which rather  I will own  gave me pain       In a place consecrated to joy  I hate to see any thing like an uneasy sensation  yet  whilst human passions are what they are  it is difficult to avoid them       There were four or five other sultanas  who seemed only the slaves of her train       In short     She look d a goddess  and she mov d a queen          I was happy the unassuming simplicity of the character in which I appeared  prevented comparisons which must have been extremely to my disadvantage       I was safe in my littleness  like a modest shrub by the side of a cedar  and  being in so different a style  had the better chance to be taken notice of  even where Lucy was       She was radiant as the morning star  and even dazzlingly lovely       Her complexion  for Temple would not suffer her to wear a mask at all  had the vivid glow of youth and health  heightened by pleasure  and the consciousness of universal admiration       Her eyes had a fire which one could scarce look at       Temple s vanity and tenderness were gratified to the utmost  he drank eagerly the praises which envy itself could not have refused her       My mother extremely became her character  and  when talking to Rivers  gave me the idea of the Roman Aurelia  whose virtues she has equalled       He looked at her with a delight which rendered him a thousand times more dear to me  she is really one of the most pleasing women that ever existed        I am called  we are just setting out for Burleigh  which I have not yet seen       Adieu  Yours  EMILY RIVERS     LETTER CCXXIV   224   To Captain FITZGERALD   Bellfield  Thursday  two o clock   WE are returned  Colonel Willmott is charmed with Burleigh  and more in love with Emily than ever       He is gone to his apartment  whither I shall follow him  and acquaint him with my marriage  he is exactly in the disposition I could wish       He will  I am sure  pardon any offence of which his belle paisanne is the cause        I am returned       He is disappointed  but not surprized  owns no human heart could have resisted Emily  begs she will allow his daughter a place in her friendship       He insists on making her a present of diamonds  the only condition  he tells me  on which he will forgive my marriage        I am going to introduce him to her in her apartment       Adieu  for a moment       Fitzgerald  I scarce respire the tumult of my joy this daughter whom I have refused my Emily could you have believed my Emily is the daughter of Colonel Willmott         When I announced him to her by that name  her color changed  but when I added that he was just returned from the East Indies  she trembled  her cheeks had a dying paleness  her voice faltered  she pronounced faintly   My father   and sunk breathless on a sofa       He ran to her  he pressed her wildly to his bosom  he kissed her pale cheek  he demanded if she was indeed his child  his Emily  the dear pledge of his Emily Montague s tenderness       Her senses returned  she fixed her eyes eagerly on him  she kissed his hand  she would have spoke  but tears stopped her voice        The scene that followed is beyond my powers of description        I have left them a moment  to share my joy with you  the time is too precious to say more  To morrow you shall hear from me       Adieu  Yours    ED  RIVERS     LETTER CCXXV   225   To Captain FITZGERALD   Temple house  Friday   YOUR friend is the happiest of mankind        Every anxiety is removed from my Emily s dear bosom  a father s sanction leaves her nothing to desire       You may remember  she wished to delay our marriage  her motive was  to wait Colonel Willmott s return       Though promised by him to another  she hoped to bring him to leave her heart free  little did she think the man destined for her by her father  was the happy Rivers her heart had chosen       Bound by a solemn vow  she concealed the circumstances of her birth even from me        She resolved never to marry another  yet thought duty obliged her to wait her father s arrival       She kindly supposed he would see me with her eyes  and  when he knew me  change his design in my favor  she fancied he would crown her love as the reward of her obedience in delaying her marriage       My importunity  and the fear of giving me room to doubt her tenderness  as her vow prevented such an explanation as would have satisfied me
