for two reasons  the first  because he is a good cook  and the second  because I shall always have an eye over him  I shall peep into his actions like a jackdaw into a marrow bone  and he must be a more cunning fellow than I take him for  to evade my vigilance  I have already told him that you intended discharging three fourths of your establishment  This declaration stuck in his stomach  and he assured me that  owing to his extreme desire of living with you  he would be satisfied with half his present wages rather than be turned off  which made me suspect that he was tied to the string of some petticoat in the hamlet  and did not like to break up his quarters  As for the under cook  he is a drunkard  and the porter a foul mouthed Cerberus  of whose guardianship our gates are in no want  neither is the gamekeeper a necessary evil  I shall take the latter office myself  as you may see to morrow  when we have got our fowling pieces in order  and are provided with powder and shot  With regard to the footmen  one of them is an Arragonese  and to my mind a very good sort of fellow  We will keep him  but all the rest are such rapscallions  that I would not advise you to harbour one of them  if you wanted an army of attendants   After having fully debated the point  we resolved to keep well with the cook  the scullion  the Arragonese  and to get rid of the remainder as decently as we could  all which was planned and executed on the same day  mollifying the bitter dose by the application of a few pistoles  which Scipio took from our strong box  and distributed among them as from me  When we had carried this reform into effect  order was soon established in our mansion  we divided the business fairly among our remaining people  and began to look into our expenses  I could willingly have been contented with very frugal commons  but my secretary  loving high dishes and relishing bits  was not a man who would suffer master Joachim to hold his place as a sinecure  He kept his talents in such constant play  working double tides at dinner and at supper  that any one would have thought we had been converted by father Hilary  and were working out the term of our probation       CH  VIII     The loves of Gil Blas and the fair Antonia   Two days after my return from Valencia to Lirias  clodpole Basil  my farming man  came at my dressing time  to beg the favour of introducing his daughter Antonia  who was very desirous  as he said  to have the honour of paying her respects to her new master  I answered that it was very proper  and would be well received  He withdrew  and in a few minutes returned with his peerless Antonia  That epithet  though bold  will not be thought extravagant  in the case of a girl from sixteen to eighteen years of age  uniting to regular features the finest complexion and the brightest eyes in the world  She was dressed in nothing better than a stuff gown  but a stature somewhat above the female standard  a dignified deportment  and such graces as soared higher than the mere freshness and glow of youth  communicated to her rustic attire the simplicity of classical costume  She had no cap on her head  her hair was fastened behind with a knot of flowers  according to the chaste severity of the Spartan fashionables   When she illumined my chamber with her presence  I was struck as much on a heap by her beauty  as ever were the princes  knights  nobles  and strangers assembled at the solemn feast and tournament of Charlemain  by the personal charms of Angelica  Instead of receiving Antonia with modish indifference  and paying her compliments of course  instead of ringing the changes on her father s happiness in possessing so lovely a daughter  I stood stock still  staring  gaping  stammering  I could not have uttered an articulate sound for the universal world  Scipio  who saw clearly what was the matter with me  took the words out of my mouth  and accepted those bills of admiration which my affairs were in too much disorder to admit of my duly honouring For her part  my figure being shrouded by a dressing gown and night cap  like the orb of day by a winter fog  she accosted me without being shame faced  and paid her duty in terms which fired all the combustibles in my composition  though her words were but the holiday expressions of common place salutation  In the mean time  while my secretary  Basil  and his daughter  were engaged in reciprocal exchange of civility  I found my senses again  and passed from one extreme of absurdity to another  just as if I had thought that a hare brained loquacity would be a set off against the idiotic silence of my first encounter  I exhausted all my stock of well bred rodomontade  and expressed myself with so unguarded a freedom  as to make Basil look about him  so that he  with his eye upon me as a man who would
