a Bastard   This Action stupified Sir Philpot  for three or four Days afterwards he spoke to no body  but sat in his own Room like a Man moped  and on Sunday Morning  it makes me shudder  when I think on t  Papa shot himself thro  the Head  but what was the cruellest of all    199he carried his Resentment beyond the Grave  for he sent a long Letter to his particular Friend  about half an Hour before he committed the Fact  wherein he gave his Reasons for what he was about to do  and begg d the Gentleman  by their long Intimacy  and as he regarded the Words of his dying Friend  that he wou d make that Letter Public  and by that prove he was not Lunatic when he kill d himself  so that his Family shou d not inherit the Estate   The Gentleman  to whom the Letter was sent  liv d about twenty Miles off  and he and Sir Philpot had been Schoolfellows together  and no two were ever more intimate  but the Gentleman was generous enough to show this Letter to my Mama  and me  no body else  He was a Counsellor at Law  and begg d her Ladyship not to be uneasy  he wou d take Care of every Thing for her   How the Affairs were managed  I cant  tell  I suppose there are some particular Methods in the Law  which  when People know how to make use of  they need not fear any Thing  at least I heard the Counsellor tell her Ladyship so  Sir Philpot s Letter  instead of being published  was burn d  And when the Coroner   200came  he was a mighty civil Man  and brought in a proper Verdict  by which we saved the Estate   Perhaps  Brother  you may wonder  that after my Mama had got clear of those Difficulties  something was not done for you  but really Lady Philpot at first would not hear a Word of Family Affairs  because  as her Ladyship observ d  they put her too much in Mind of the late unhappy Accident  And as she was  and you must remember  Brother  a very fine Woman  she was surrounded with Acquaintance  And to dissipate her Grief  she was hurried into so much Company  that we had not a Moment to ourselves  or for ourselves   For really  Brother  People of Fashion have more fatiguing Lives  than the lower Set of Mortals wou d believe  Those Persons of Distinction I mean  who are willing to appear as such  for what with receiving and returning Visits  Auction Day s  Dressing and Undressing  Opera Nights  Routs  Assemblies  Breakfastings  Plays  Airing in Hyde Park  and Vauxhall  Parties once or twice in the Seasons  I do assure you  we are in a continual Flutter of Dissipations  and it must therefore be expected that fine Women  instead of thinking about   201Home  are too much hurried to think about any thing   But now  Brother  I am to claim the Forgiveness you have promised me  I shall faithfully relate Matters of Fact  just as they happened  I was barely Sixteen when we appear d Abroad again  and Lady Philpot  contrary to other Parents  was pleas d to carry me every where with her  But how unhappy are the young Part of our Sex  who are shown into Life unaccompanied with a proper Guide  our Minds tainted insensibly by our Intimates —I am sure however that mine was   After Dinner  when the Ladies are withdrawn  Gentlemen  as I ve been told  over their Bottle  often converse together very loosely  Our Sex  I assure you  at sometimes  are not much behind Hand with yours  as to the Topics of their Discourse  only we are  I fancy  more delicate in our Phrases   I had some very intimate Acquaintances  Ladies  who were rather older than myself  but were full as sprightly  and  to use their own Words  hated Prudery  From them I was instructed in such Things  My God  I have heard of People whose Brains have been turn d by Pride  one Passion will intoxicate the   202Understanding as much as another  I was almost mad for Enjoyment  to such a Pitch I had heighten d my Imagination   I cou d think  talk  or hear of nothing else  and only the Fear of being refus d  prevented me from asking the first Man I met the Question  they had made me imagine it must be all Elysium   A Gentleman just at this Time  one of our Neighbours in the Country  ask d my Mama s Consent to pay his Addresses to me  Upon his bare Promise of Marriage  which I only took to save Appearances  I admitted him to stay all Night with me in my Bedchamber  there I gave myself up to all those promis d Toys  dying Murmers  and swimming Extasies I had so long and so fondly fancied   But Enjoyment answer d not at all the Idea which I had entertain d of it  Next Morning I honestly declar d so to my Lover —Confess d to him  that it was
