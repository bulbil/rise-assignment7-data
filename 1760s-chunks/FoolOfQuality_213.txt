him better health  and away he went      We had not gone above half a mile further when I saw a little   girl  in a field on the right hand  endeavouring to drive a cow   through a small gate into the road  in order to be milked  as I   suppose  by her mother   but the cow kicked up her heels  and   proved wanton and refractory  and ran hither and thither  and   would not be guided  The poor child then set up a cry of as bitter   distress as if all that was valuable in the world was going to ruin    Harry gave a ready ear to the sound of lamentation  and  seeing the   plight that the poor thing was in  he suddenly crossed the road    above ankle deep in dirt  and leaping the ditch  he proved nimbler   than the cow  and driving her through the pass  he turned her into   the way that the child would have her go          TEE FOOL OF QUALITY  219     That morning  indeed  was to Harry a morning of petty adven    tures  By the time that we approached the suburbs  we had nearly   overtaken a grown girl who carried a basket of eggs on her head    A great lubberly boy just then passed us by at a smart pace  and   tripping up to the girl  gave the basket a tip with his hand  and   dashed all the eggs into mash against a stony part of the road    and  again taking to his heels  rim on as before  Immediately   Harry s indignation was kindled  and setting out at top speed    he soon overtook him  and gave him several smart strokes with   his little cane across the shoulders  The fellow then turned upon   Harry  and gave him a furious blow with his fist over the head    while I hastened to his relief  as I perceived that the other was   quite an overmatch for him  But before I arrived our hero had   put a quick end to the combat   for  springing from the ground  he   darted his head full into the nose and moutli of his adversary  who   instantly roared out  and  seeing his own blood come pouring down    he once more took to flight  while Harry continued to press upon   him  and belaboured him at pleasure  till he judged that he had   beaten him to the full value of the eggs      Meanwhile the poor girl  wholly unmindful of what passed    remained wailing and wringing her hands over the wreck of her   merchandise  The voice of a siren could not so powerfuly have   attracted and recalled Harry from the length he had gone   he   returned with speed to her  and I followed  My poor girl  says he    where were you going with those eggs   To market  master  says   she  And what did you expect to get for them  About five   shillings  sir   and I had promised my daddy and mammy to lay it   out in shoes and stockings for my little brothers and sisters   and so   I must now bear all the blame of the poor things going barefoot    Here she again set up her wailings  and her tears poured down   afresh      Harry then desired me to lend him ten shillings  and turning to   the mourner Hold out your two hands  my poor girl  he cried   then   putting five shillings into each hand  Here is the payment for your   eggs  said he   and here are five shillings more  though I fear it is   too little to pay you for all the tears they cost you      Never did I see so sudden  so great a change in any countenance    Surprise  gratitude  ecstasy flashed from her eyes  and gave a joyous   flush to the muscling of her aspect  She hurried her money into   her bosom  and dropping on her knees in the dirt  and seizing hold   of Harry s hand  she squeezed and kissed it repeatedly  without   being able to utter a word   while Harry s eyes began to fill  and    endeavouring to disengage himself  he made oif as fast as he could   from such thanks as he thought he had no way deserved      This  sir  was the last of our adventures going to London  But   had you seen us  on our return  about two hours ago  you would   have wondered at the miry plight into which we were put  by   helping passengers up with their bundles that had tumbled into the   dirt  or by assisting to raise cattle that had fallen under their
