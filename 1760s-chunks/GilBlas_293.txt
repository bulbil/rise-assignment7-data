be quite as much out at elbows as ever Job was  More bonds and judgments against him than ever Job had  take my word for it  replied Ordonnez  Let him lick the spittle of his titled friends and patrons till his stomach heaves at the nauseating saliva  his printed dedications and his oral flattery  in spite of all the cringing and all the toad eating  which constitute the stock in trade of his profession  with all the profits of his works  whether by subscription or ordinary publication  will not bring grist enough to his mill  to keep hunger from the door  Mind if what I say does not turn out to be true  He will come to the dogs at last   Nothing more likely  replied I  for he cohabits with the muses already  and many a plain man has found  to his cost  that there is no keeping company with the sisters  without being worried by their bullying brethren  My friend Fabricio would have done much better by remaining quietly with your lordship  he would now have been lying on a bed of roses  and everything he had touched would have turned to gold  He would at least have been in a very snug berth  said Manuel  He was a great favourite of mine  and I meant  by a regular gradation from subaltern to principal situations  to have established him in ease and affluence on the basis of public charity  but the foolish fellow took it into his head to set up for a wit  He wrote a play  and brought it out at the theatre in this town  the piece went off tolerably well  and nothing thenceforth would serve his turn but commencing author by profession  Lope de Vega  in his estimation  was but a type of him  preferring  therefore  the intoxicating vapour of public applause to the plain roast and boiled of this substantial ordinary  he came to me for his discharge  It was to no purpose for me to argue the point  or to prove to him what a silly cur he was  to drop the bone and run after the shadow  the mad blockhead was so suffocated by the smother of authorship  that the instinctive dread of fire could not rouse his alacrity to escape burning  In short  he was miserably unconscious of his own interest  as his successor can testify  for he  possessing practical good sense  though without half Fabricio s quickness and versatility  makes it his whole study and delight to go through his business in a workmanlike manner  and to fall in with all my little ways  In return for such good conduct  I pushed him forward in a manner corresponding with his deserts  and he unites in his own person  even at this time of day  two offices in the hospital  the least lucrative of which would be more than sufficient to place any honest man at his ease  though encumbered with a yearly teeming wife       CH  II     Gil Blas continues his journey  and arrives in safety at Oviedo  The condition of his family  His father s death  and its consequences   FROM Valladolid we got to Oviedo in four days  without any untoward accident on the road  in spite of the proverb  which says  that robbers lay their ears to the ground  when pilgrims are going with rich offerings  and traders are riding with fat purses  It would have been a feasible  as well as a tempting speculation  Two tenants of a subterraneous abode might have presented an aspect to have frightened our doubloons into a surrender  for courage was not one of the qualities I had imbibed at court  and Bertrand  my mule driver  seemed not to be of a temper to get his brains blown out in defending a purse into which he had no free ingress  Scipio was the only one of the party who was anything of a bully   It was night when we came into town  Our lodgings were at an inn near my uncle  Gil Perez  the canon  I was very desirous of ascertaining the circumstances of my parents before my first interview with them  and  in order to gain that information  it was impossible to make my inquiries in a better channel than through my landlord and landlady  into the lines of whose faces you could not look without being satisfied that they knew every tittle of their neighbours  concerns  As it turned out  the landlord kenned me after a diligent perusal of my features  and cried out  By Saint Anthony of Padua  this is the son of the honest usher  Blas of Santillane  Ay  indeed  said the hostess  and so it is  without a single muscle altered  just for all the world that same little stripling Gil Blas  of whom we used to say that he was as saucy as he was high  It brings old times to my memory  when he used to come hither with his bottle under his arm  to fetch wine for his uncle s supper   Madam  said I  you have a most inveterate memory  but for goodness  sake change the subject  and tell me the modern news of my family  My father and mother are doubtless in no very enviable situation
