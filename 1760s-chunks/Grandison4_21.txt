and mother declining in their healths  Signor Jeronymo worse than when Sir Charles lest them  His Sister also declining in her health  Yet earnest still to see him        He says  That she is at present at Urbino  but is soon to go to Naples to the General s  He urges him to make them one visit more  yet owns  that his family are not unanimous in the request  But that he and Father Marescotti  and the Marchioness  are extremely earnest that this indulgence should be granted to the wishes of his dear Sister        He offers to meet him  at his own appointment  and conduct him to Bologna  where  he tells him  his presence will rejoice every heart  and procure an unanimous consent to the enterview so much desired  And says  that if this measure  which he is sorry he has so long withstood  answers not his hopes  he will advise the shutting up of their Clementina in a Nunnery  or to consign her to private hands  where she shall be treated kindly  but as persons in her unhappy circumstances are accustomed to be treated      Sir Charles then shewed me a Letter from Signor Jeronymo  in which he acquaints him with the dangerous way he is in  He tells him     That his life is a burden to him  He wishes it was brought to its period  He does not think himself in skilful hands  He complains most of the wound which is in his hip joint and which has hitherto bassled the art both of the Italian and French surgeons who have been consulted  He wishes  that himself and Sir Charles had been of one country  he says  since   53 the greatest felicity he now has to wish for  is to yield up his life to the Giver of it  in the arms of his Grandison      He mentions not one word in this melancholy Letter of his unhappy sister  Which Sir Charles accounted for  by supposing  that she not being at Bologna  they kept from him  in his deplorable way  everything relating to her  that was likely to disturb him   He then read part of a Letter written in English  by the admired Mrs  Beaumont  some of the contents of which were  as you shall hear  extremely affecting      Mrs  Beaumont gives him in it an account of the situation of the unhappy young lady  and excuses herself for not having done it before  in answer to his request  by reason of an indisposition under which she had for some time laboured  which had hindered her from making the necessary enquiries        She mentions  that the Lady had received no benefit from her journeyings from place to place  and from her voyage from Leghorn to Naples  and back again  and blames her attendants  who to quiet her  unknown to their principals  for some time  kept her in expectation of seeing her Chevalier  at the end of each  for her more prudent Camilla  she says  had been hinder d by illness from attending her  in several of the excursions        They had a second time  at her own request  put her into a Nunnery  She at first was so sedate in it as gave them hopes  But the novelty going off  and one of the sisters  to try her  having officiously asked her to go with her into the parlour  where she said  she would be allowed to converse through the grate with a certain English gentleman  her impatience  on her disappointment  made her more ungovernable than they had ever known her  for she had been for two hours before meditating what she would say to him       54   For a week together  she was vehemently intent upon being allowed to visit England  and had engaged her cousins  Sebastiano and Juliano  to promise to escort her thither  if she could obtain leave        Her mother brought her off this when nobody else could  only by intreating her  for her sake  never to think of it more        The Marchioness then  encouraged by this instance of her obedience  took her under her own care  But the young Lady going on from flight to flight  and the way she was in visibly affecting the health of her indulgent mother  a doctor was found  who was absolutely of opinion  that nothing but harsh methods would avail  And in this advice Lady Sforza  and her daughter Laurana  and the General  concurring  she was told  that she must prepare to go to Milan  She was so earnest to be excused from going thither  and to be permitted to go to Florence to Mrs  Beaumont  that they gave way to her entreaties  and the Marquis himself  accompanying her to Florence  prevailed on Mrs  Beaumont to take her under her care        With her she staid three weeks  She was tolerably sedate in that space of time  but most so  when she was talking of England
