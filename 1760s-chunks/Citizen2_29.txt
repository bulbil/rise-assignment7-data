that ever chirruped in petticoats   But what raises my indignation to the greatest degree  is that this piping does not only pester me on the stage  but is my punishment in private conversation  What is it to me  whether the fine pipe of one  or the great manner of the other be preferable  what care I if one has a better top  or the other a nobler bottom  how am I concerned if one sings from the stomach  or the other sings with a snap  yet paltry as these matters are  they make a subject of debate wherever I go  and this musical dispute  especially among the fair sex  almost always ends in a very unmusical altercation   Sure the spirit of contention is mixed into the very constitution of the people  divisions among the inhabitants of other countries arise only from their higher concerns  but subjects the most contemptible are made an affair of party here  the spirit is carried even into their amusements  The very ladies  whose duty should seem to allay the impetuosity of the opposite sex  become themselves party champions  engage in the thickest of   87 the fight  scold at each other  and shew their courage  even at the expence of their lovers and their beauty   There are even a numerous set of poets who help to keep up the contention  and write for the stage  Mistake me not  I don t mean pieces to be acted upon it  but panegyrical verses on the performers  for that is the most universal method of writing for the stage at present  It is the business of the stage poet therefore to watch the appearance of every new player at his own house  and so come out next day with a flaunting copy of newspaper verses  In these nature and the actor may be set to run races  the player always coming off victorious  or nature may mistake him for herself  or old Shakespear may put on his winding sheet and pay him a visit  or the tuneful nine may strike up their harps in his praise  or should it happen to be an actress  Venus  the beauteous queen of love  and the naked graces  are ever in waiting  the lady must be herself a goddess bred and born  she must—but you shall have a specimen of one of these poems  which may convey a more precise idea   On seeing Mrs       perform in the character of           To you  bright fair  the nine address their lays   And tune my feeble voice to sing thy praise   The heart felt power of every charm divine   Who can withstand their all commanding shine   See how she moves along with every grace   While soul brought tears steal down each shining face     88She speaks   tis rapture all and nameless bliss   Ye gods  what transport e er compar d to this   As when in Paphian groves the queen of love   With fond complaint address d the listening Jove    Twas joy  and endless blisses all around   And rocks forgot their hardness at the sound   Then first  at last even Jove was taken in   And felt her charms  without disguise  within   And yet think not  my friend  that I have any particular animosity against the champions who are at the head of the present commotion  on the contrary  I could find pleasure in their music  if served up at proper intervals  if I heard it only on proper occasions  and not about it wherever I go  In fact  I could patronize them both  and as an instance of my condescension in this particular  they may come and give me a song at my lodgings  on any evening when I m at leisure  provided they keep a becoming distance  and stand  while they continue to entertain me  with decent humility at the door   You perceive I have not read the seventeen books of Chinese ceremonies to no purpose  I know the proper share of respect due to every rank in society  Stage players  fire eaters  singing women  dancing dogs  wild beasts  and wire walkers  as their efforts are exerted for our amusement  ought not entirely to be despised  The laws of every country should allow them to play their tricks at least with impunity  They should not be branded with the ignominious appellation of vagabonds  at least they deserve a rank in society equal to the mystery of barbers  or undertakers  and could my influence extend so far  they should   89 be allowed to earn even forty or fifty pounds a year  if eminent in their profession   I am sensible however that you will censure me of profusion in this respect  bred up as you are in the narrow prejudices of eastern frugality  You will undoubtedly assert  that such a stipend is too great for so useless an employment  Yet how will your surprize encrease  when told  that though the law holds them as vagabonds  many of them earn more than a thousand a year  You are amazed  There is cause for amazement  A vagabond with a thousand a year is indeed a curiosity in
