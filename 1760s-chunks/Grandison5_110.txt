recollecting a part of one of her dreams  Yet  some excuse lies good  for an old soul  whose whole life has been but one dream  a little fal lalishly varied—And  would you think it   yes  I believe you would  My odd creature was once or twice put upon endeavouring to recollect two or three dreams of his own  of the week past  and would have gone on  if I had not silenced him by a frown  as he looked upon me for his cue  as a tender husband ought   Beauchamp came in  and I thought would have relieved us  But he put my aunt in mind of an almostforgotten part of her dream  for just such a joyful meeting  just such expressions of gladness  did she dream of  as she now beheld  and heard  between my brother and him felicitating each other  Duce take these dreaming souls  to remember their resveries  when realities infinitely more affecting are before them  But Reflexion and Prognostic are ever inspiriting parts of the pretension of people who have lived long  dead to the Present  the Past and the Future filling their minds  And why should not they be indulged in the thought that they know something more than those who are less abstracted  and who are contented with looking no further than the Present   Sir Charles enquired after Sir Harry s health  Mr  Beauchamp  with a concern that did him credit  lamented his declining way  and he spoke so respectfully of Lady Beauchamp  and of her tenderness to his father  as made my brother s eyes glisten with pleasure   Lord and Lady L  Dr  Bartlett  and Emily  were at Colnebrook  But as they had left orders to be sent for  the moment my brother arrived  for you need not doubt but his last Letter prepared us to expect him soon  they came time enough to dine with us  There was a renewal of joy among us   Page  275 Emily  the dear Emily fainted away  embracing the knees of her guardian  as she  unawares to him  threw herself at his feet  with joy that laboured for expression  but could not obtain it  He was affected  So was Beauchamp  So were we all  She was carried out  just as she was recovering to a shame and confusion of face  for which only her own modesty could reproach her   There are susceptibilities which will shew themselves in outward acts  and there are others which cannot burst out into speech  Lady L s joy was of the former  mine of the latter  sort  But she is used to tenderness of heart  Mine are ready to burst my heart  but never hardly can rise to my lips—My eyes  however  are great talkers   The pleasure that Sir Charles  Lord L  and Dr  Bartlett  mutually expressed to see each other  was great  tender  and manly  My bustling nimble Lord enjoyed over again his joy  at that of every other person  and he was ready  good naturedly  to sing and dance—That s his way  poor man  to shew his joy  but he is honest  for all that  Don t despise him  Harriet  He was brought up as an only son  and to know that he was a Lord  or else he would have made a better figure in your eyes  The man wants not sense  I assure you  You may think me partial  but I believe the most foolish thing he ever did in his life  was at church  and that at St  George s  Hanover square  Poor soul  He might have had a wife better suited to his taste  and then his very foibles would have made him shine  But  Harriet  it is not always given to us to know what is best for ourselves  Black women  I have heard remarked  like fair men  fair men  black women  and tempers suit best with contraries  Were we all to like the same person or thing equally  we should be for ever engaged in bro••  As it is  human nature  vile rogue  as I have heard it called  is quarrelsome enough  So my Lord  being a lost man  fell in love Page  276 if it please you  with a saucy woman  He ought to be meek and humble  you know  He would not let me be quiet  till I was his  We are often to be punished by our own choice  But I am very good to him now  I don t know  Harriet  whether it is best for me to break him of his trifling  or not  Unless one were sure  that he could creditably support the alteration  Now can I laugh at him  and  if the baby is froppish  can coax him into good humour  A sugar plumb  and a courtesy  will do at any time  and  by setting him into a broad grin  I can laugh away his anger  But should I endeavour to make him wise  as the man has not been used to it  and as his education has not given him a turn to significance  don t you
