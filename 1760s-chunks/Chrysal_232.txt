    These conditions were too easy not to be immediately complied   with  He accordingly swore eternal secrecy  and readily told his   lordship that the girl was no other than the kitchen maid s daughter    who served as a scullion wench under her mother  This discovery   of his mistress s quality was almost as disagreeable to his lordship   as the dog boy s jealousy  However  he smothered his vexation    and stealing secretly into the house  that he might not be seen in   such a condition  retired to his own apartment by himself  to change   his clothes  and wash off the blood and dirt with which he was all   over plentifully daubed          266 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA       As soon as he had set himself somewhat to rights  he rang for   his valet de chambre  who was his usual agent upon such occasions    and ordered him to bring the kitchen maid s daughter up to him    The valet  who was sufficiently acquainted with the caprioiousness   of his master s taste  was not in the least surprised at his choice of   such an object  but obeyed him directly  The fortunate female    who had found out the quality of her new lover by his snuff box    which she had picked out of his pocket  was almost afraid to obey   the glad summons  for fear she might be suspected of having de    signedly occasioned the outrage his lordship had lately met  How    ever  her ambition getting the better of her fear  she suffered   herself to be prevailed on  and went  trembling and blushing in   all the bashfulness of virgin innocence  to know his lordship s   commands        If he had been surprised at the discovery of her condition  he   was much more agreeably so at the sight of her   for  though she   was far from being handsome  there was something in her face   which  with her extreme youth  and a glow of health that her   confusion heightened not a little  struck his fancy in an uncommon   manner  He therefore  without giving her the least hint of what   had happened  as he imagined she knew nothing of him  made no   ceremony of proposing love to her  But  young as she was  she had   too much woman in her soul to comply so easily  though there was   nothing she desired more ardently  Accordingly  she refused his   lordship with the most respectful modesty  and  on urging his   request further  threw herself at his feet in a flood of tears  and   begged him to have compassion upon her friendless youth and   innocence  Such behaviour would have made him doubt the   dog boy s information  did not the sound of her voice convince him   she was the person  He therefore laughed at her artifice  and told   her that  as soon as the farce was ended  he should expect another   answer  as he knew she had granted to others the favour he asked   of her  This convinced her that he had discovered her  and that   it was necessary for her to enlarge her scheme to accomplish the   design she had formed  of establishing a lasting interest in his   affections  Accordingly  upon his saying this  she embraced his   knees in a seeming agony of distress  and conjuring him to have   mercy on her folly  owned she had transgressed with one  and one   only  who had made such an impression upon her heart  that though   she had taken him for another  and knew not even who he was  she   had made a vow never to repeat her folly with any other        The candour of this confession  the greatest part of which he   thought he knew to be true  completed her conquest over him  He   raised her from the ground  and  embracing her tenderly  discovered   himself to her  The consequence is obvious  She immediately   appeared in public as his mistress  and had the address to accom    modate herself so entirely to his caprices  that she soon gained the   absolute mastery of his heart  As for the poor dog boy  he was   turned off  of course  as an offence to her sight  though not without   a considerable gratuity to purchase his silence  But that was   impossible  The moment he left the house  he looked upon himself   as freed from the necessity of concealing it any longer  and made         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 267     it the common subject of his discourse  till it became as publicly   known as ids lordship s name        This happened just
