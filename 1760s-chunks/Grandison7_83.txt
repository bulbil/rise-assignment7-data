Lord G  —I had like to have said—I believe I did say—Then will you ruin  absolutely ruin  me  What shall I do—for my Roguery —  Never  never part with what you call so —  Impossible  my Lord  to retain it  if it lose its wonted power over you  I shall have a new lesson to learn  O my Lord  why began you not this course before Harriet and Caroline set out for Grandisonhall  I might by a closer observation of their behaviour  have made myself mistress of lessons that would have far more delightfully supplied the old ones  than can be done without their examples  But  my Lord  the time will soon come  when we shall be allowed to fly to that benefit at Grandison hall  Our little Harriet shall go with us  The infant is the cement between us  and we will for the future be every day more worthy of that  and of each other   My Lord hurried from me in speechless rapture  His handkerchief at his eye—Nurse  said I  bring me again our precious charge  I will be all the mother  I clasped it to my bosom  What shall I do  my little Harriet  Thy father  sweet one  has run away with my Roguery—  What a scene is here —I will not read it over  If it requires a blush  do you  my dear  blush for me  I am hardened—And shall not perhaps  were I to re peruse it  my maternity so kindly acknowleged  so generously accepted  by my Lord G  be able to blush for myself     213 But  that I may seem only to have changed the object  not wholly to have parted with my levity  read the inclosed here  in answer to the appeal of the young people  directed thus   Lady G  To Miss LUCY SELBY  And the rest of the Girls at Selby house   Greeting   YOU appeal to Harriet  and revoke your appeal  You appeal to me  and withdraw it in the same Letter—a parcel of chits  You know not what you would have  what you would be  and hardly what you are  You can have the sauciness in more places than one  to reflect upon me your judge  But are you not convinced by the solid arguments of Mrs  Shirley  and her Mrs  Eggleton  If you are not  what strange creatures are girls from sixteen to twenty two  Don t boys read romances as well as girls  Yet  in these latter days  do the glaring absurdities influence them so much in Love matters  or last so long  Foolish things  would you give a preference against yourselves to the other Sex   Harriet  I think  was a romantic girl  when she made her declarations of one man only  or no one  for a husband  I did let her know my mind at the time by hints  But had my brother actually married Clementina  not only I  but her grandmother Shirley  and aunt Selby  and uncle too  odd soul as he is in some things  would have spoken out  in favour of the young Earl of D  And had it not been with success  after a proper time had passed  I  for my part  would have set her down as a very silly girl  inferior  in this respect  to you  Lucy  and to twenty more I could name  For how few of us are there  who have their first Loves  And indeed how few first Loves are fit to be encouraged  You know my thoughts  Lucy    214 of a beginning Love  in a young bosom  a —A very  very silly and childish affair  believe me   Let me enumerate a few chances that may render a first Love impracticable   A young woman may fix her affections on a man  who may prove persidious—On a man  who may be engaged to another woman  as had like to have been my brother s case—On a man who may be superior to her in degree or fortune  or who may be greatly inferior to her in both —If Love be not a voluntary passion  why not upon an hostler  a groom  a coachman  a footman—A grenadier  a trooper  a footsoldier —She may be in Mrs  Eggleton s case  Her Lover may be taken from her by death  In either  or any  of these cases  what is to be done  Must a woman sit down  cry herself blind  and become useless to the principal end of her being  as to this life  and to all family connexions  when  probably  she has not lived one third of her time —Silly creatures —to maintain these nonsenses at their own expence  in favour of a passion that is generally confined to the days of girlhood  and which they themselves would laugh at in a woman after she was arrived at honest thirty  or at years of discretion—Thus narrowing their own use and consequence —I  for my part  am  and ever will be  a friend of my Sex   But hark ye  girls—Let me ask you—Do you find many of these constant nymphs  when they have
