       CHAPTER VIIL     DURING his fit  the surgeon came with his instruments and   dressings   and having in vain attempted to restore him  by sprink    ling water in his face  and by the application of hartshorn to his   nose and temples  he took some blood from him  whereon he opened   his eyes  and began to breathe with freedom  He then examined   his wound  which was a little above his forehead  and declared it so   slight as scarce to be an excuse for keeping his chamber  The   surgeon  having dressed it  received his fee and retired  and my   father ringing for the drawer  ordered up a flask of Burgundy  with   a cold fowl  oil  and vinegar      When the table was laid  and the waiter desired to withdraw    my father again looked earnestly and compassionately upon me   I believe  says he  my child may be hungry  and straight his   countenance falling  and the muscles of his lips beginning to work    he broke into tears  Barbarous wretch   he exclaimed   unnatural   ostrich   who could thus leave the first begotten of thy bowels to   the nakedness of the sands  and to the blasting of the elements      No  no  my father  I cried  again throwing myself on my knees   before him   kill me not with your tears  crush me not with this   your unmerited concern   All is well  all is happy and blessed as   I can bear it to be  This moment overpays my years of anguish     it is like heaven after passing the vale of death and mortal sufferings      After supper  of which my father scarce tasted  he got up  and    as I rose at the same time  he stepped to me  and catching me   passionately in his arms  and putting his neck across mine My   child  he cried   my beloved child  my life s blessed preserver   come   once more to my bosom  enter thy forsaken mansion   Too long has   it been desert and desolate without thee   But here I vow to the   Almighty  that no stepdames  nor viperous instruments  shall ever   hereafter insinuate between us   accursed be they who shall attempt   to divide us   and may they come to an evil end who shall desire   to deprive me of thee  the light of mine eyes  till I am cold and   insensible to every other joy      While we sat over our bottle  my father called for ink and paper    and first presenting me with a purse of fifty guineas  he again   gave me a bill at sight on his banker for five hundred pounds    I started up  but stopping me  he cried Hold  hold  my Hammy    I see myself overpaid in the acknowledgments of that dear though   meagre countenance   and then as I kneeled before him  with both     H         98 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      hands held over me  and eyes raised to heaven  he blessed me in   an ejaculation of the tenderest ardour      The reckoning being discharged  and two chairs ordered to the   door  my father desired me to meet him at the same tavern the   following evening   and said that  in the mean time  he would think   of settling some certain income upon me   and thus we parted  as   though our souls had accompanied each other      It was now near two o clock  and the morning bitter cold  My   Arabella had  long since  put her child to rest   and I found her in   tears by a fire  scarce alive  She started up on my entering   her   face gleamed with a sickly joy   and she uttered some soft re    proaches  of love and apprehension  for my absence at those hours      Before I ventured to let in the full tide of our returning happi    ness on her weak and alarmed spirits  I took out some confections   and a pint of sack  which I had purposely brought in my pocket    I broke some Naples biscuit into a cup  and pouring some of the   wine upon it  I set her the example  and prevailed on her to eat      Meanwhile she gazed earnestly and inquisitively in my face    My Hammy  she tenderly cried  what is the meaning of this    What eyes are these  Hammy  what new kind of a countenance   is this you have brought home to me   Ah  forbid it  my God
