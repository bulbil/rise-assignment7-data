received the following information —   For my peart  measter  I knows nothing amiss of the doctor—he s a quiet sort of an inoffensive man  uses my house sometimes  and pays for what he has  like the rest of my customers  They says he deals very little in physic stuff  but cures his patients with fasting and water gruel  whereby he can t expect the  pothecary to be his friend  You knows  master  one must live  and let live  as the saying is  I must say  he  for the value of three guineas  set up my wife s constitution in such a manner  that I have saved within these two years  I believe  forty pounds in  pothecary s bills  But what of that  Every man must eat  thof at another s expense  and I should be in a deadly hole myself if all my customers should take it in their heads to drink nothing but water gruel  because it is good for the constitution  Thank God  I have as good a constitution as e er a man in England  but for all that  I and my whole family bleed and purge  and take a diet drink twice a year  by way of serving the  pothecary  who is a very honest man  and a very good neighbour    Their conversation was interrupted by the return of the apothecary with the doctor  who had very little of the faculty in his appearance  He was dressed remarkably plain  seemed to be turned of fifty  had a careless air  and a sarcastical turn in his countenance  Before he entered the sick man s chamber  he asked some questions concerning the disease  and when the apothecary  pointing to his own head  said   It lies all here   the doctor  turning to Sir Launcelot  replied   If that be all there s nothing in it    Upon a more particular inquiry about the symptoms  he was told that the blood was seemingly viscous  and salt upon the tongue  the urine remarkably acrosaline  and the faeces atrabilious and foetid  When the doctor said he would engage to find the same phenomena in every healthy man of the three kingdoms  the apothecary added  that the patient was manifestly comatous  and moreover afflicted with griping pains and borborygmata   A f—t for your borborygmata   cried the physician   what has been done   To this question  he replied  that venesection had been three times performed  that a vesicatory had been applied inter scapulas  that the patient had taken occasionally of a cathartic apozem  and between whiles  alexipharmic boluses and neutral draughts — Neutral  indeed   said the doctor   so neutral  that I ll be crucified if ever they declare either for the patient or the disease   So saying  he brushed into Crabshaw s chamber  followed by our adventurer  who was almost suffocated at his first entrance  The day was close  the window shutters were fastened  a huge fire blazed in the chimney  thick harateen curtains were close drawn round the bed  where the wretched squire lay extended under an enormous load of blankets  The nurse  who had all the exteriors of a bawd given to drink  sat stewing in this apartment like a damned soul in some infernal bagnio  but rising when the company entered  made her curtsies with great decorum — Well   said the doctor   how does your patient  nurse  — Blessed be God for it  I hope in a fair way  To be sure his apozem has had a blessed effect— five and twenty stools since three o clock in the morning  But then  a would not suffer the blisters to be put upon his thighs  Good lack  a has been mortally obstropolous  and out of his senses all this blessed day  — You lie   cried the squire   I an t out of my seven senses  thof I m half mad with vexation    The doctor having withdrawn the curtain  the hapless squire appeared very pale and ghastly  and having surveyed his master with a rueful aspect  addressed him in these words   Sir Knight  I beg a boon  Be pleased to tie a stone about the neck of the apothecary  and a halter about the neck of the nurse  and throw the one into the next river  and the other over the next tree  and in so doing you will do a charitable deed to your fellow creatures  for he and she do the devil s work in partnership  and have sent many a score of their betters home to him before their time   — Oh  he begins to talk sensibly  — Have a good heart   said the physician   What is your disorder  — Physic  — What do you chiefly complain of  — The doctor  — Does your head ache  — Yea  with impertinence    Have you a pain in your back  — Yes  where the blister lies  — Are you sick at stomach  — Yes  with hunger  — Do you feel any shiverings  — Always at sight of the apothecary  — Do you perceive any load in your bowels  — I
