enemy  upon his march to Crown Point  he found both that fort and Ticonderago deserted and destroyed  There now  therefore  remained but one grand and decisive blow to put all North America in possession of the English  This was the taking of Quebec  a city handsomely built  populous  and flourishing  Admiral Saunders commanded the naval part of the expedition  that by land was committed to the conduct of General Wolfe  This young soldier  who was not yet thirty five  had distinguished himself on many former occasions  particularly   240 in the siege of Louisburg  a part of the success of which was justly ascribed to him  who  unin debted to family or connexions had raised himself by merit to his present command  The war in this part of the world had hitherto been carried on with extreme barbarity  and each side seemed to have adopted the savage manners of the Indians  whose country they disputed  Wolfe  however  disdained these base proceedings  and carried on all the terrors of war with the humanity of a truly civilized European  A description of the siege of this city may instruct a soldier  but can scarcely inform a citizen  be it sufficient to observe  that its beginning appeared extremely unpromising to the besiegers  and repeated repulses even served to abate the hopes of the commander    I know  said he  that the affairs of Great Britain require the most vigorous measures  but then the courage of an handful of brave men should be exerted only where there is some hope of a favourable event  At present the difficulties are so various that I am at a loss how to determine    However  he resolved  though now sinking under fatigue and sickness  to make one vigorous attempt before he gave up all  and accordingly  in the night  part of his troops  with great difficulty made themselves masters of an hill that commanded the town  A battle ensued  Montcalm  the French commander  resolved not to survive the defeat of his country  Wolfe  on the other side  resolved to conquer or die  Both commanders had their wish  both fell  but the English were victorious  The circumstances attending the death of Wolfe served to give an example like that of the noble Theban  He  in the beginning of the engagement  received a wound in the hand  which he dissembled  wrapping it round with his handkerchief  to stop the effusion of blood  he advanced with unconcern  a second ball  was more fatal  it pierced his breast  so that  unable to proceed  he leaned on the   241 shoulder of a soldier who was near him  Now  struggling in the agonies of death  and just departing  he heard a voice cry   they run   he seemed to revive a moment at the sound  and  asking who ran  was informed the French  expressing his wonder that they ran so soon  and unable to gaze any longer  he sunk on the soldier s breast  and his last words were   I die happy   Perhaps the loss of such a man was greater to the nation than the conquering of all Canada was advantageous  but it is the misfortune of humanity  that we can never know true greatness till that moment when we are going to lose it     The surrender of the city was the consequence of this victory  and  with it  the total cession of all Canada  The French  it is true  made  in the ensuing season  a vigorous effort to retake it  but  by the good conduct of our Governour  the town held out till relieved by an English fleet  under the command of Lord Colville  Thus did this campaign make ample reparation for all the losses that had been hitherto sustained by the English  The French had now no force capable of making any resistance  they held out the war now  not with hopes of victory  but honourable capitulation  one place after another was invaded  Montreal  at last  surrendered  and  in a short time  a country  which their own writers have represented as being more extensive than the Roman Empire  fell totally under the power of his Britannic Majesty   How far the extending dominion tends to the increasing the strength of a nation  is an object worthy consideration  The splendour of victory should never dazzle the eye of reason  No people ever could call their country powerful  if it were not populous  For political force depends upon the small frontier to be defended  and the vicinity of an army to every place to be invaded  but extended Empire takes away both these advantages  and  before the soldier   242 can traverse half his proper territories  his country may have already felt all the horrors of invasion  Whatever joy therefore our country might have felt at these immense acquisitions  of remote territory  I own it gives me no very pleasing prospect  The manufactures  the trade  and the riches of these distant countries  can never recompence for the continual drain of useful and industrious subjects  that must be derived from the mother country to people them  Wherever the lower sort of people in any kingdom can fly from labour  they will be
