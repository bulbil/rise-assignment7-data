delicacy  even had she not been prepossessed in favour of another  for   tho  she respected him as the brother of her friend  that consideration   was too weak to hinder her from letting him know how displeasing his   pretensions were to her  and that if he persisted in them she should be   obliged to refuse seeing him any more  He was now sensible of his error    and endeavoured to excuse it by the violence of his passion  which he   said would not suffer him to conceal what he felt  but as  when a heart   is truly devoted to one object  the sound of love from any other mouth   is harsh and disagreeable  the more he aimed to vindicate himself in   this point the more guilty he became  and all he said served only to   increase her dislike       Mademoiselle de Coigney after this took upon her to intercede for her   brother s passion  but with as ill success as he had done  and being one   day more importunate than usual  mademoiselle Charlotta grew in so ill a   humour  that she told her she was determined to give no encouragement to   the amorous addresses of any man  unless commanded to do so by those who   had the power of disposing her  but  added she  I would not have   monsieur de Coigney make any efforts that way  for were he to gain the   consent of my father  which I am far from believing he would do  I have   so little inclination to give him those returns of affection he may   expect  that in such a case I should venture being guilty of   disobedience       Is there any thing so odious then  madam  in the person of my brother    said de Coigney with a tone that shewed how much she was picqued  I   never gave myself the trouble of examining into the merits either of his   person or behaviour  replied she  but to deal sincerely with you  I have   a perfect aversion to the thoughts of changing my condition  and if you   desire the friendship between us should subsist  you will never mention   any thing of it to me   and as to your brother  when I am convinced I   shall receive no farther persecutions from him of the nature I have   lately had  he may depend on my treating him with my former regard  till   then  you will do me a favour  and him a service  to desire he would   refrain his visits       These expressions may be thought little conformable to the natural   politeness of the French  or to that sweetness of disposition which   mademoiselle Charlotta testified on other occasions  but she found   herself so incessantly pressed both by the brother and the sister  and   that all the denials she had given in a different manner had been   without effect  therefore was obliged to assume a harshness  which was   far from being natural to her  in order to prevent consequences which   she had too much reason to apprehend       Horatio soon discovered he had a rival in monsieur de Coigney  and tho    he easily saw by Charlotta s behaviour that he had nothing to fear on   this score  yet the interruptions he received from the addresses of this   new lover  made him little able to endure his presence  and he sometimes   could not refrain himself from saying such things as  had not the other   been too much buoyed up with his vanity to take them as meant to   himself  must have occasioned a quarrel       She made use of all the power she had over him in order to curb the   impetuosity of his temper whenever he met this disturber of his wishes    but his jealousy would frequently get the better of the respect he paid   her  and they never were together in her apartment without filling her   with mortal fears  She therefore found it absolutely necessary to get   rid of an adorer she hated  in order to hinder one she loved from doing   any thing which might deprive her of him  and tho  she had a real   friendship for mademoiselle de Coigney  yet she chose rather to break   with her  than run the hazard she was continually exposed to by her   brother s indefatigable pursuit       But all her precaution was of no effect  as well as  the enforced   patience of Horatio  what most she trembled at now fell upon her  and by   a means she had least thought of  Madame de Olonne  full of malice at   being forsaken by her lover  and soon informed by whose charms her   misfortune was occasioned  got a person to represent to the baron de   Palfoy the conquest his daughter had made in such terms  as made him
