tho’ you have been the best of masters to me  to have asked your permission to return to my friends  in order to settle    in my trade  as I have some capital of my own  But to be sure  Sir  I shall be directed in this  as in every thing else  by your will and pleasure  I approve of your design intirely  said I  but there are certain conditions that must be previously settled between you and me  In the first place  tell me honestly  what is the capital you say you are worth   He answered  his father had left him about eight thousand livres  which were in the hands of a banker in Paris  whom he named to me  and referred me to him for confirmation of the truth of what he told me   Well  said I  this will go a good way towards setting you up in your own business  Where do you think of settling   He answered  Paris was the best place for his trade   On that I put an absolute negative  I said Paris was too much frequented by my countrymen  to be a proper place for Mrs Gerrarde to make her appearance in  as she was likely to meet there with more of her acquaintance than might be convenient  I told him I had no objection to any other large provincial town   He said he was born at Dijon  and should like to go thither  as he had many friends there   Be it so  said I  What I purpose doing for you is this  Mrs Gerrarde has eight hundred pounds of her own  I will add as much more to it  for which I will give you my bond  till I can have the money remitted from England  and this you shall settle on her  that she may be sure of a support in case of your death  and the interest you shall allow her for her own separate use  but without her knowing that you are tied down to it  that you may have it in your power to oblige her   He made no reply  but acquiesced with a low bow   I laughed at the simplicity of his countenance  Pivet  said I  though I have taken care of Mrs Gerrarde’s interest  I do not intend to neglect yours  provided you make no demur to the terms  You already know my reasons for proceeding as I have done in this affair  I have great cause to apprehend Mrs Gerrarde’s vindictive spirit  if she should find means  which I know she will endeavour at  to lay open the real state of this transaction to some people in England  This might frustrate all that I have been at so much pains to accomplish  be it your care then to prevent it  I cannot wish you to use harsh measures with your wife  but if you have address enough to prevent a correspondence with any one in England   an elopement  for both your sakes  I am not willing to suppose  though I think  for some time    at least  you must keep a strict eye over her  if  as I said  you can prevent a correspondence  I think it will answer my purpose  and that I may make it your interest to do this  I will bind myself  by as strong an obligation as the law can make  to pay you two hundred pounds a year English  so long as you keep your wife within the bounds prescribed  provided  if  after three years  I find those terms no longer necessary  they shall  if I then chuse it  become void  I shall also add something to enable you to fit up a house and a shop  that you need not be under a necessity of breaking in upon your capital   Pivet’s gratitude overflowed at his lips for this  as he called it  noble provision  He said  he made no doubt of gaining so far upon Mrs Gerrarde’s affections  as to be able effectually to fulfil his covenant  without using violent methods  but  said he  at all events  I warrant you shall hear no more of her   Preliminaries thus adjusted  I sent for a notary of reputation  to whom I gave instructions to draw up two separate articles for the purposes mentioned  the latter was to be a secret between Pivet and me  as it was by no means proper for Mrs Gerrarde to be let into it  The other  which regarded her own particular settlement  was intended for her perusal and approbation  I charged the notary to use dispatch  and he promised to have both the papers ready by next morning  as also the bond which I was to give Pivet for the payment of eight hundred pounds   The lawyer brought the papers according to his promise  and they were signed  sealed  and delivered in due form  That which was to be the private agreement between Pivet and me  was worded in consequence of an article which I drew up myself  and made Pivet sign  wherein I set forth particulars at large   Pivet was very impatient to see his beloved  but a little uneasy lest she should be disgusted with him  when
