 But so it is  She jests  she rallies  But I cannot rally her again  Love  it is said  dignifies the adored object  Perhaps it is that which awes me   And now will your Ladyship doubt of an affirmative answer to your second question  Whether Love has listed me in the number of her particular admirers   He has  And the devil take me if I can help myself  And yet I have no encouragement—Nor any body else  that s my consolation  Fenwick is deeper in  if possible  than I  We had at our first acquaintance  as you have heard  a tilting bout on the occasion  But are sworn friends now  each having agreed to try his fortune by patience and perseverance  and being assured that the one has no more of her favour to boast of than the other a     We have indeed blustered away between us half a scorce more of her admirers  Poor whining Orme  however  perseveres  But of him we make no account  He has a watry head  and tho  he finds a way  by his sister  who visits at Mr  Selby s  and is much esteemed there  to let Miss Byron know his passion for her  notwithstanding the negative he has received  yet doubt we not  that she is safe from a flame that he will quench with his tears  before it can rise to an head to disturb us       6   You Ladies love men should whine after you  But never yet did I find  that where a blustering fellow was a competitor  the Lady married the milksop      But let me in this particular do Miss Byron justice  How she manages it  I can t tell  but she is courteous to all  nor could ever any man charge her either with pride or cruelty  All I fear  is  that she has such an equality in her temper  that she can hardly find room in her heart for a particular Love  Nor will  till she meets with one whose mind is near as faultless as her own  and the general tenor of whose life and actions calls upon her discretion to give her leave to love     This apprehension I owe to a conversation I had with her grandmother Shirley  a Lady that is an ornament to old age  and who hinted to me  that her grand daughter had exceptions both to Fenwick and me  on the score of a few indulgences that perhaps have been too public  but which all men of fashion and spirit give themselves  and all women  but this  allow of  or hate not men the worse for  But then what is her objection to Orme  He is a sober dog      She was but eight years old when her mother died  She also was an excellent woman  Her death was brought on by grief for that of her husband  which happened but six months before—A rare instance   The grandmother and aunt  to whom the girl is dutiful to a proverb  will not interfere with her choice  If they are applied to for their interest  the answer is constantly this  The approbation of their Harriet must first be gained  and then their consent is ready   There is a Mr  Deane  a man of an excellent character for a Lawyer  but indeed he left off practice on coming into possession of an handsome estate  He was the girl s godfather  He is allowed to have great influence over them all  Harriet calls him papa    7 To him I have applied  But his answer is the very same  His daughter Harriet must choose for herself  All motions of this kind must come first from her   And ought I to despair of succeeding with the girl herself  I  her Greville  not contemptible in person  in air—free and easy  at least  having a good estate in possession  fine expectances besides  dressing well  singing well  dancing well  and blest with a moderate share of confidence  which makes other women think me a clever fellow  She a girl of twenty  her fortune between ten and fifteen thousand pounds only  for her father s considerable estate  on his demise  for want of male heirs  went with the name  Her grandmother s jointure not more than 500l  a year—And what though her uncle Selby has no children  and loves her  yet has he nephews and nieces of his own  whom he also loves  for this Harriet is his wife s niece   I will not despair  If resolution  if perseverance  will do  and if she be a woman  she shall be mine—And so I have told her aunt Selby  and her uncle too  and so I have told Miss Lucy Selby  her cousin  as she calls her  who is highly and deservedly in her favour  and so indeed have I more than once told the girl herself   But now to the description of her person—Let me die  if I know where to begin  She is all over loveliness  Does not every body else who has seen her  tell you so  Her Stature  shall
