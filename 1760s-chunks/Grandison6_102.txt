you have reason to howl  as you call it  Sir Charles Grandison is your particular friend  you know   True  Miss Orme  affecting to laugh off this hit  I thought I could have braved it out  but now the matter comes near  it sticks here  just here pointing to his throat  I cannot get it through my gizzard  Plaguy hard of digestion  making faces  in his light way   But will your brother  proceeded he  be contented to stay within the noise of the bells  which will   in a few days perhaps  be set a ringing  for ten m•les round  Sir Charles drives on at a d—nable rate  I hear     But he must let me die decently  I can tell him  We will not part for ever with the flower of our county  without conditions    Shall you see the Siren  madam  If you do  tell her  that I have no chance for peace  but in hating her heartily  But  whispering Miss Orme  bid her NOT TO BE TOO SECURE     I was strangely struck with these words  for my spirits were not high before  I repeated them  I dwelt upon them  and wept —Fool that I was  But   254 I soon recollected myself  and desired Miss Orme not to take notice of my tender folly   Friday   I HAVE had a visit from Mr  Orme  He has given me some pleasure  I added not to his melancholy  He asked me several interesting questions  which I would not have answered any other man  as I told him  I shall always value Mr  Orme  Your brother is the most generous of men  But were he not so very generous  he ought to allow for my civility to this worthy man  since I can applaud him with my whole heart  for loving the noble Clementina  What a narrow hearted creature must I be  if I did not  But as a woman s honour is of a more delicate nature  I believe  than a man s with regard to personal love  so perhaps  if this be allowed me  a man may be as jealous of a woman s civility  in general cases  I mean  as a woman may be of a man s Love to another object  This may sound strange  at first hearing  Lady G  but I know what I mean  Nobody else does  Harriet  perhaps you will say  But they would  I reply  if I were to explain myself  which at present  if you apprehend me not  I have no inclination to do   How did this worthy man praise Sir Charles Grandison  He must see that my pride  no  not pride  my gratitude  was raised by it  as well to the praiser as praised  He concluded with a blessing on us both  which he uttered in a different manner from what that Balaam Greville uttered his  It was followed with tears  good man  and he left me almost unable to speak  How grateful in our ears are the praises bestowed on those whom we fondly love   Lucy thinks I had best go to my grandmamma s before he comes down  and that he should visit me there from Selby house  Neither my aunt nor I am of this opinion  but that he should himself go to Shirley manor  and visit us from thence  For is not Selby house my usual place of residence  My grandmamma   255 will be delighted with his company  and conversation  But as he cannot think of coming down before the latter end of next week  at the soonest  it is time enough to consider of these things  Yet can a young creature  the awful solemnity so near  and with a man whom she prefers to all others  find room in her head for any other topic   I have a Letter from my good Mrs  Reeves  She and my cousin are so full of this happy subject  that they invite themselves down to us  and hope we will excuse them for their earnestness on this occasion  They are prodigiously earnest  I wonder my cousin can think of leaving her little boy  My aunt says  there is no denying them  How so —Surely one may excuse one s self to friends one so dearly loves  Your presence  my Charlotte  I own  would be a high satisfaction to me  Yet you would be a little unmanageable  I doubt  There can be no hope of Lady L s  But if there were  neither she  nor any body else  could keep you orderly —Poor dear Emily —My aunt wishes  that we could have had her with us  But  for her own sake  it must not be  How often do I revolve that reflexion of your brother s  that  in our happiest prospects  the sighing heart will confess imperfection  But I will not add another word  after I have assured you  my dearest Ladies  that I am  and ever will be   Your grateful and most affectionate humble Servant  HARRIET BYRON   LETTER XL  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  To Miss BYRON
