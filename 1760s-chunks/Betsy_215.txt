 and   afterwards on yourself   With these words he withdrew  without staying   for an answer        I know not   said Miss Mabel  after he was gone   whether what I have   to say to you will be of sufficient moment to excuse me for depriving   you of your company  since I only called to tell you  that we are eased   of your little pensioner at Denham  by the father s unexpectedly coming   to claim his own        Miss Betsy replied  that she guessed as much  for she had heard those   people had been at her lodgings when she was not at home  and had said   somewhat of their business to her servant   I am also to pay you     resumed the other   my quota of the last month s nursing   In speaking   these words she took out of her pocket the little sum she stood indebted   for  and laid it on the table       Though Miss Betsy had the most perfect regard and good wishes for Miss   Mabel  and Miss Mabel the same for Miss Betsy  yet neither of them was   in the secrets of the other  they visited but seldom  and  when they   did  talked only on indifferent affairs  In fine  though they both loved   the amiable qualities each found in the other  yet the wide contrariety   between their dispositions occasioned a coolness in their behaviour   which their hearts were far from feeling       Miss Mabel stayed but a very few minutes after having dispatched the   business she came upon  nor was Miss Betsy at all troubled at her   departure  being at present  what she very rarely was  in a humour   rather to be alone than in any company whatever       She no sooner was at liberty than she began to reflect on the   transactions of that morning  she had done two things which seemed   pretty extraordinary to her  she had entirely dismissed one lover  a   piece of resolution she did not a little value herself upon  but then   she was vexed at the too great encouragement  as she thought it  which   she had given to another        What shall I do with this Munden   said she to herself   If my brothers   should take it into their heads to approve of his pretensions  I shall   be as much teazed on his account as I was on that of Mr  Trueworth  I   have no aversion  indeed  to the man  but I am equally as far from   having any love for him  there is nothing in his person  or behaviour    that might make a woman ashamed of being his wife  yet I can see nothing   so extraordinary in him as to induce me to become so        Why  then   continued she   did I not tell him at once I would not have   him  and that  if he was weary of paying his respects to me  he might   carry them where they would be more kindly received  It was a very silly   thing in me to send him to my brothers  they are in such haste to get me   out of the way of what they call temptation  that I believe they would   marry me to any man that was of a good family  and had an estate  If I   must needs have a husband to please them  I had better have taken   Trueworth  I am sure there is no comparison between the men  but it is   too late to think of that now  for it is very plain  both by his   behaviour to me when last I saw him  and by what he said to my brother   Frank  that he has given over all intentions on that score        She was in the midst of these cogitations  when a servant belonging to   the ladies whom she visited at St  James s  came  and presented her with   a letter  containing these lines             To Miss Betsy Thoughtless            Dear creature            My sister and self had an invitation to a party of pleasure  where        there will be the best company  the best musick  and the best        entertainment in the world  but my father having unluckily forced        her to pass some days with an old aunt  who lies dangerously sick        at Hampstead  I know nobody can so well supply her vacant place as        your agreeable self  therefore  if you
