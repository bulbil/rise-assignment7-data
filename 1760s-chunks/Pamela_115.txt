of that Burgundy    I went to do it  but my hand shook so  that I could not hold the plate   with the glass in it  and spilt some of the wine  So Mrs  Jewkes poured   it for me  and I carried it as well as I could  and made a low courtesy    He took it  and said  Stand behind me  out of my sight       Why  Mrs  Jewkes  said he  you tell me she remains very sullen still    and eats nothing  No  said she  not so much as will keep life and soul   together   And is always crying  you say  too  Yes  sir  answered she  I   think she is  for one thing or another  Ay  said he  your young wenches   will feed upon their tears  and their obstinacy will serve them for meat   and drink  I think I never saw her look better though  in my life   But    I suppose  she lives upon love  This sweet Mr  Williams  and her little   villanous plots together  have kept her alive and well  to be sure  For   mischief  love  and contradiction  are the natural aliments of a woman       Poor I was forced to hear all this  and be silent  and indeed my heart   was too full to speak       And so you say  said he  that she had another project  but yesterday  to   get away  She denies it herself  said she  but it had all the appearance   of one  I m sure she made me in a fearful pucker about it  And I am glad   your honour is come  with all my heart  and I hope  whatever be your   honour s intention concerning her  you will not be long about it  for   you ll find her as slippery as an eel  I ll assure you       Sir  said I  and clasped his knees with my arms  not knowing what I did    and falling on my knees  Have mercy on me  and hear me  concerning that   wicked woman s usage of me        He cruelly interrupted me  and said  I am satisfied she has done her   duty  it signifies nothing what you say against Mrs  Jewkes  That you   are here  little hypocrite as you are  pleading your cause before me    is owing to her care of you  else you had been with the parson   Wicked   girl  said he  to tempt a man to undo himself  as you have done him  at   a time I was on the point of making him happy for his life       I arose  but said with a deep sigh  I have done  sir   I have done   I   have a strange tribunal to plead before  The poor sheep in the fable had   such an one  when it was tried before the vulture  on the accusation of   the wolf       So  Mrs  Jewkes  said he  you are the wolf  I the vulture  and this the   poor innocent lamb on her trial before us   Oh  you don t know how well   this innocent is read in reflection  She has wit at will  when she has   a mind to display her own romantic innocence  at the price of other   people s characters       Well  said the aggravated creature  this is nothing to what she   has called me  I have been a Jezebel  a London prostitute  and what   not   But I am contented with her ill names  now I see it is her   fashion  and she can call your honour a vulture       Said I  I had no thought of comparing my master  and was going to say   on  but he said  Don t prate  girl   No  said she  it don t become you    I am sure       Well  said I  since I must not speak  I will hold my peace  but there   is a righteous Judge  who knows the secrets of all hearts  and to him I   appeal       See there  said he  now this meek  good creature is praying for fire   from heaven upon us  O she can curse most heartily  in the spirit of   Christian meekness  I ll assure you   Come  saucy face  give me another   glass of wine       So I did  as well as I could  but wept so  that he said  I suppose I   shall have some of your tears in my
