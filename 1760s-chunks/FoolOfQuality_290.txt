endeavours to   engage and bind him to us      In the mean time  Harry  on delivering his celestial message  flew   like a feather from his post  and  casting his cloak about him    vanished into an adjoining closet      The company now began to gather fast  and Harry  stealing from   his retreat  kept his cloud about his sky  and mingled in the crowd    Mr  Clement had accompanied Mr  Fenton in dominoes  They soon   discovered Harry  and were highly diverted by the account which   he gave them of his metamorphosis into a statue       While the assembly was dividing into pairs and chatty parties  a   phenomenon entered that drew all their attention  The Honourable   Major Gromley  the lustiest and fattest young man in the kingdom    advanced without a mask  in petticoats  a slobbering bib  and apron          314 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      He carried a large round of bread and butter in one hand  while   Lady Betsy Minit  an elderly miss of about three feet high  held his   leading strings with her left hand  and in her right brandished a   birch rod of lengthened authority  His governante pressed him   forward  and seemed to threaten chastisement for his delay   while   the jolly  broad  foolish  humorous  half laughing  half crying  baby    face of the major  extorted peals of laughter from all who were   present  And this is sufficient to convince us  that the performers   of the ancient drama could not possibly in masks excite the passions   of nature  No excellence of voice or gesture  of action or emphasis    could compensate for the exclusion of the immediate interpreters   of the soul  the living speech of the eye  and varied expression of   the countenance      After the major had leisurely traversed the full length of the   room  and inimitably executed the whole of his part  he retired to   undress and assume a new appearance      Mean while  two females entered in very unusual habits  The   first was dressed in a choice collection of old English and Scotch   ballads  from Chevy Chace and the fragment of Hardi Canute  down   to Barbara Allan and the Babes in the Wood  The other was all   hung from top to bottom with looking glasses      Immediately the crowd gathered about them  All who were fond   of their own history  preferable to that of others  paid their homage    in a circling throng  to the queen of the looking glasses   while the   few who preferred instruction  were intent in perusing the fair   covered with knowledge  But the lady of the mirrors did not long   retain her votaries   her glasses were all emblems of her own dis    position they were the glasses of scandal and calumny  and re    presented the human species in the most distorted view  some   lengthened and some widened their objects beyond measure  while   others wholly inverted and turned them topsy turvy  All slunk   away in disgust from such prospects of their own persons  and the   reflecting lady was justly left to glitter apart from society      The next who entered was a Goliath  all sheathed in complete   steel  He advanced with slow and majestic steps to the sideboard    and  asking for a flask of champagne  turned it down without   taking it once from his head  He then demanded another  and   another  and so on  till the provedore  who had looked and longed   in vain to see him drop  ran panic struck to his master  and in a   half whisper said My lord  your cellars will scarcely suffice to   quench the thirst of one man here   he has already turned down   fifteen flasks of champagne  and still is unsatisfied  and calls for   more  Then give him fifteen hogsheads  replied the earl  laughing     and  if that will not answer  send out for more      In the mean time  the mailed champion had withdrawn from the   sideboard  and  with a large drinking glass in his hand  advanced   till he got into the midst of the assembly  He then turned a little   instrument that was fixed in a certain part of his double cased   armour  and filling the glass to the brim  he unclasped the lower   part of his beaver  and accosting a Peruvian princess who stood just   opposite Permit me the honour  madam  says he  of drinking your   highness s health  so saying  the liquor was out of sight in a         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  315
