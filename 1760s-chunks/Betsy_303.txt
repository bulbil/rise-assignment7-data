nobody would answer  though I knocked two or three times   which  by the   way  if he did at all  it was too softly for them to hear        Confusion   cried Mr  Thoughtless  now worked up to the highest pitch   of jealous rage   I ll try if they will open to me   With these words he   drew his sword  and flew up stairs  burst open the door  and rushed into   the room with all the fury of an incensed lion  The astonished guilty   pair had neither thought nor means to escape  the lover  on the first   burst of the door  jumped out of the window into the yard  Mademoiselle   ran screaming to one corner of the room   Abandoned woman   cried   Thoughtless   your punishment shall be the second course   then    followed by his man with lights  ran in pursuit of the person who had   injured him       This unhappy woman  not daring to stand the tempest of his rage when he   should return  took the opportunity of his having quitted the chamber to   make her escape  though  at the time she did so  as she had truly told   Mrs  Munden  she neither knew where nor to whom she should apply for   refuge       The mercer  in the mean time  was found by Mr  Thoughtless  but in a   condition more exciting pity than revenge  the poor man had broke both   his legs with his fall  and was otherwise very much hurt  but on seeing   by whom  and in what manner he was approached  the terror of immediate   death made him exert all the strength that was left in him to cry out   for pardon  which word he repeated over and over again in the most   lamentable tone that could be  Mr  Thoughtless  on this  turned hastily   away  bidding his servants raise and carry him into the hall  where a   chair being presently brought  he was put into it  and sent home to make   the best excuse he could to his wife for the mischief that had happened   to him       Every room was afterwards searched for Mademoiselle de Roquelair  but   she not being found  and a maid servant remembering that  in the midst   of the confusion  the street door had been left open  the flight of that   lady was not to be doubted       Though these disturbances had taken up the greatest part of the night    Mr  Thoughtless was able to enjoy little repose after going to bed  and   rose rather sooner than usual  he was up and dressed when his sister   came  but was a good deal surprized to be told of her being there  as   she had never visited him before without a formal invitation        Good morrow  my dear sister   said he  as soon as she was introduced     this is a favour quite unexpected  pray  what brings you abroad thus   early     You men   answered she   who keep such late hours  may well   think it early  but for us women  who live more regularly  it is no   wonder to see us breathe the morning air  but I assure you I rose   somewhat sooner than ordinary to day on your account     On mine  As   how  pray   demanded he   I am come   answered she   to solicit in   behalf of a person who has fallen under your displeasure  Mademoiselle   de Roquelair         Mademoiselle de Roquelair   cried he  hastily interrupting her   what   knowledge can you have of that infamous creature   She then ingenuously   related to him how they had met by accident at the mercer s  the offer   she had then made of her friendship  and how  as she supposed    emboldened by that mistaken encouragement  she had flown to her house   for shelter the preceding night   You see how dangerous it is   said he     to make friendship at first sight  but surely the wretch cannot flatter   herself with the least distant hope of a reconciliation         Far be it from me  Sir   replied Mrs  Munden very gravely   to become   the negociator of such a treaty  or even to attempt a vindication of her   behaviour  no  it is your own honour  for which alone I am concerned    and that  I think  requires you should send her to a monastery  since    as she says  you deprived her of the opportunity of entering into one
