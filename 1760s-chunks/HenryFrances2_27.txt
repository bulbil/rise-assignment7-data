 Skies   One Chorus let all Being raise   All Nature s Incense rise   LETTER CCXVII   INDEED  my Harry  I wish to live for no other Reason  but to make you amends for all your Goodness to me  God grant my Power may be in any Proportion equal to my Will  and we shall be the happiest Couple breathing  And  indeed  I think I may  without Vanity  say  I know no two Persons  who seem better qualified for such a State  than we are  and therefore we must be thoroughly miserable  if we are not entirely happy  for both our Feelings and Sentiments are too delicate and refined  to be capable of that Indifference  which the generality of Mortals pass their Lives in  For which Reason  I am not displeased that your Situation and Circumstances prevented our living together  before I was thoroughly acquainted Page  102 with you  or myself  but  though I think I might now safely answer for my future Conduct  I own my most fervent Wishes are sometimes damped with fearing  that  if ever we should live together  you may grow weary of me  or  as Milton phrases it    Too much Converse thee perhaps may satiate   However  I more often lament the sad Necessity which parts us  and I think you more to be pitied in this Separation  even than I am  supposing our Love to be quite equal  I have the Pains of Absence to combat with  which are perhaps as much as I can bear  You have these also  joined to the Reflection of having attached yourself to me  for no other Reason  but the Hope of finding a sincere tender Friend  and an agreeable Companion  You have made it my Duty  as well as Inclination  to become the sole Partner  and chief Solace of your every Care  to smooth the rugged Path of Life  and make the Uphill  as well as the Descent  less painful  nay  even your common Affairs and Oeconomy are so situated  that you really want a reasonable Woman  and a faithful Friend  in whom you might confide  Will you not think me vain  if I say you are deprived of such a Person by our Separation  When I consider the Opportunities I lose of endearing myself to you by numberless nameless Acts of Love and Page  103 Gratitude  I lament each passing Moment  and regret my fleeting Youth  for  oh  I want unnumbered Ages  beyond the common Date of Man  to prove my fond  faithful  grateful Soul to thee  Oh  never may the Veil of Passion cloud it more     LETTER CCXVIII   My Dear FANNY           What I meant to take Notice of in your Letters was  to reprimand you for even supposing it possible I should ever cease to love you  This Subject  which you too often enter upon  always alarms me  for  if ever I should love you less  it must be owing to yourself  I assure you  that it never once enters into my Head  but when you mention it  and  upon such Occasions  I naturally reflect upon every Circumstance  in our past  present  and future Lives  which might possibly effect such a Change  which is  by no Means  a healthful Contemplation  On the contrary  when my Thoughts and Reflections are left to my own Guidance  I direct them to your Conversation  Page  104 to your Letters  to your Kindness to  and Confidence in me  I compare you to any other Woman  and  taking you all in all  give you your Advantage  I beg Leave to put you in Mind  that this is not the first Time  by many  that I have warned you against this Indiscretion  but your Wit does not always give Way to your Sense    And  when we grasp the Happiness we wish   We call on Wit to argue it away   I have taken a great deal of Pains  well rewarded  to gain your Love  but have taken a great deal more to teach you how to preserve mine  That my Happiness depended upon it  was not so strong a Reason to me  as that I believed yours rested upon the same Foundation  And I have been always more your Friend than your Lover  not by exerting the first Character  which my Sense and Reason sufficiently inclined me to  but by restraining the latter  which my Heart so strongly impelled me to  And my best Love  my first  my last  my only Love  shall always find the Exercise of both these Characters exerted toward her  while there is one Quality in her charming Composition  which can be the proper Subject of either  or  rather  she is very near being that clever Creature  which is capable of happily blending both these Affections in one  for which nothing more is necessary  but to use that Understanding  upon all Occasions  Page  105 which you are capable of exerting upon some  Nor did I mean to be ridiculous  when I said you should not comb your Head  or call a Coach
