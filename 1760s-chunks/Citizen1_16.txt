most passionately desired the pleasure of my acquaintance  and  with the utmost impatience  expected an interview  I will not deny  my dear Fum Hoam  but that my vanity was raised at such an invitation  I flattered myself that she had seen me in some public place  and had conceived an affection for my person  which thus induced her to deviate from the usual decorums of the sex  My imagination painted her in all the bloom of youth and beauty  I fancied her attended by the loves and graces  and I set out with the most pleasing expectations of seeing the conquest I had made   When I was introduced into her apartment  my expectations were quickly at an end  I perceived a little shrivelled figure indolently reclined on a sofa  who nodded by way of approbation at my approach  This  as I was afterwards informed  was the lady herself  a woman equally distinguished for rank  politeness  taste  and understanding  As I was dressed after the fashion of Europe  she had taken me for an Englishman  and consequently saluted me in her ordinary manner  but when the   49 footman informed her grace that I was the gentleman from China  she instantly lifted herself from the couch  while her eyes sparkled with unusual vivacity     Bless me  can this be the gentleman that was born so far from home  What an unusual share of somethingness in his whole appearance  Lord how I am charmed with the outlandish cut of his face  how bewitching the exotic breadth of his forehead  I would give the world to see him in his own country dress  Pray turn about  Sir  and let me see you behind  There  there s a travell d air for you  You that attend there  bring up a plate of beef cut into small pieces  I have a violent passion to see him eat  Pray  Sir  have you got your chop sticks about you  It will be so pretty to see the meat carried to the mouth with a jerk  Pray speak a little Chinese  I have learned some of the language myself  Lord  have you nothing pretty from China about you  something that one does not know what to do with  I have got twenty things from China that are of no use in the world  Look at those jars  they are of the right pea green  these are the furniture    Dear madam  said I  those  though they may appear fine in your eyes  are but paltry to a Chinese  but  as they are useful utensils  it is proper they should have a place in every apartment  Useful  Sir  replied the lady  sure you mistake  they are of no use in the world  What  are they not filled with an infusion of tea as in China  replied I  Quite empty and useless upon my honour  Sir  Then they are the most cumbrous and clumsy furniture in the world  as nothing is truly elegant but what unites use with beauty  I protest  says the lady  I shall begin to suspect thee of being an actual barbarian  I suppose   50 also you hold my two beautiful pagods in contempt  What  cried I  has Fohi spread his gross superstitions here also  Pagods of all kinds are my aversion  A Chinese  a traveller  and want taste  it surprises me  Pray  sir  examine the beauties of that Chinese temple which you see at the end of the garden  Is there any thing in China more beautiful  Where I stand I see nothing  madam  at the end of the garden that may not as well be called an Egyptian pyramid as a Chinese temple  for that little building in vi•w is as like the one as t other  What  Sir  is not that a Chinese temple  you must surely be mistaken  Mr  Freeze  who designed it  calls it one  and nobody disputes his pretensions to taste  I now found it vain to contradict the lady in any thing she thought fit to advance  so was resolved rather to act the disciple than the instructor  She took me through several rooms all furnished  as she told me  in the Chinese manner  sprawling dragons  squatting pagods  and clumsy mandarines  were stuck upon every shelf  In turning round one must have used caution not to demolish a part of the precarious furniture     In a house like this  thought I  one must live continually upon the watch  the inhabitant must resemble a knight in an enchanted castle  who expects to meet an adventure at every turning  But  Madam  said I  do no accidents ever happen to all this finery  Man  Sir  replied the lady  is born to misfortunes  and it is but fit I should have a share  Three weeks ago a careless servant snapp d off the head of a favourite mandarine  I had scarce done grieving for that  when a monkey broke a beautiful jar  this I took the more to heart  as the injury was done me by a friend  however  I survived the calamity  when yesterday crash went half a dozen   51 dragons upon the marble hearth stone  and
