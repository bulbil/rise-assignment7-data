 The Duke having thus entirely broke their left  and pushed them over the river Allen  returned to the field  where they found that part of the rebel army which had been victorious  but  instead of renewing the engagement  both armies continued to gaze at each other  neither caring to engage  till towards evening both sides drew off  each boasting of victory  Which ever might claim the triumph  it must be owned  that all the honour  and all the advantages of the day  belonged only to the Duke of Argyle  It was sufficient for him to have interrupted the enemies progress  and delay was to them a defeat  The Earl of Mar therefore soon found his disappointments  and losses increase  The castle of Inverness    123 of which he was in possession  was delivered up to the King by Lord Lovat  who had hitherto appeared in the interest of the Pretender  The Marquis of Tullibardine left the Earl to defend his own country  and many of the Clans seeing no likelihood of coming soon to a second engagement  returned home  An irregular army being much easier led to battle  than induced to bear the fatigues of a campaign   The pretender might now be convinced of the vanity of his expectations  in imagining that the whole country would rise up in his cause  his affairs now were actually desperate  yet  with the usual infatuation of the family  he resolved to hazard his person among his friends in Scotland  at a time when such a measure was totally useless  Passing therefore through France in disguise  and embarking in a small vessel at Dunkirk  he arrived  on the twenty second day of December  on the coasts of Scotland  with only six gentlemen in his retinue  Upon his arrival in Aberdeen  he was solemnly proclaimed  and soon after made his public entry into Dundee  and  in two days more  came to Scoon  where he intended to have the ceremony of his coronation performed  He ordered thanksgivings for his safe arrival  injoined the ministers to pray for him in the churches  and  without the smallest share of power  went through all the ceremonies of royalty  which were  at such a juncture  perfectly ridiculous  After this unimportant parade  he resolved to abandon the enterprize with the same levity with which it had been undertaken  and embarked again for France  together with the Earl of Mar  and some others  in a small ship that lay in the harbour of Montross  and  in five days  arrived at Gravelin  General Gordon  who was left commander in chief of the forces  with the assistance of the Earl marshal  proceeded with them to Aberdeen  where he secured three vessels to sail northward  which took on board the persons who intended to   124 make their escape to the continent  In this manner the rebellion was suppressed  but the fury of the victors did not seem in the least to abate with success  The law was now put in force  with all its terrors  and the prisons of London were crowded with those deluded wretches whom the ministry shewed no disposition to spare  The commons  in their address to the crown  declared they would prosecute in the most vigorous manner the authors of the rebellion  and their resolutions were as speedy as their measures were vindictive  The Earls Derwentwater  Nithsdale  Carnwath  and Wintown  the Lords Widrington  Kenmuir  and Nairn  were impeached  The Habeas Corpus act was suspended  and the rebel Lords  upon pleading guilty  received sentence of death  Nothing could soften the Privy Council  the house of Lords even presented an address to the throne for mercy  but without effect  Orders were dispatched for executing the Earls of Derwentwater and Nithsdale  and the viscount Kenmuir  immediately  the others were respited for three weeks longer  Nithsdale  however  escaped in woman s cloaths  which were brought him by his mother  the night before his intended execution  Derwentwater and Kenmuir were brought to the scaffold on Tower hill  at the hour appointed  Both underwent their sentence with calmness and intrepidity  pitied by all  seemingly less moved themselves than the spectators   An act of parliament was also made for trying the private prisoners in London  and not in Lancashire  where they were taken in arms  which proceeding was  in some measure  an alteration of the ancient constitution of the kingdom  when Foster  Mackintosh  and several others were found guilty  Foster  however  escaped from Newgate  and reached the continent in safety  and some time after also Mackintosh  with some others  forced their way  having   125 mastered the keeper and turnkey  and disarmed the centinel  Four or five were hanged  drawn  and quartered  among whom was William Paul  a clergyman  who professed himself a true and sincere member of the Church of England  but not of that schismatical church whose Bishops had abandoned their King  Such was the end of a rebellion  probably first inspired by the rigour of the new Whig ministry and parliament  In running through the vicissitudes of human transactions  we too often find both sides culpable  and so it was in this case  The royal party acted under the influences of partiality
