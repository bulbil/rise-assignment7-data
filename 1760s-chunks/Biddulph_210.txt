in a peremptory tone  there is nothing now to hinder you  the heavy misfortune which has fallen upon him  puts it in your power to make him such a return as his prosperous days would not have allowed you  You can confer an obligation on him    now  so that scruple is rubbed out  As for any former idle aspersions  you have already done more than enough to convince the world they were without foundation  I could wish indeed that Jezebel of a wife had been cut off in the common way  but since he was guiltless in his intentions  it would be barbarous to make that an objection  and I dare answer for it  all mankind will acquit him  though the law perhaps may not  of that scoundrel’s death  who so well deserved it at his hands   I told Mr Warner  that though Mr Faulkland had proposed something like this  I was sure it was owing to his distracted mind  for that he had at first declared he only came to take a last look at me  and that I hoped  when he came to the cool use of his reason  he would be far from urging such a request—The more are you bound then  said he  interrupting me  to deal generously by him —What does your brother say upon the subject  He has not touched upon it  I replied  I was so taken up with hearing Mr Faulkland’s melancholy story from my brother  that I mentioned not to him his wild proposal  and as Sir George told me Mr Faulkland was much more composed when he left him to his rest  I presume he hinted nothing of that kind to my brother   Ay  ay  cried Mr Warner  Sir George to be sure will change his note  Mr Faulkland is now a fallen man  therefore depend on it he will not be for your marrying him  but for this very reason  I insist on your doing a noble thing  If you have a grain of honour  or of gratitude in you  you will not hesitate a moment  I will not desire you  continued he  finding me silent  to carry your gratitude so far as to marry a madman  if he should prove to be so  but if on your visit to him this morning  you find him composed  and in his right mind  make him a frank offer of your hand  and see you do it handsomely  consult not George  upon the subject  I will have it all my doing  Go  added he  if I did not know that at the bottom of your heart you love Faulkland  I would not make this a point with you  but notwithstanding all your pretended demurs I am sure that is the case   I should be disingenuous to deny it  answered I  far from doing so  I will own that I should prefer him before all the world  if the strangeness of his present situation did not frighten me  Trouble not your head about that  cried Mr Warner  if the man is in his senses  do as I bid you  and take care that you acquit yourself with honour   He left me without waiting for a reply  What can I say or do  my Cecilia  My heart and my reason are at variance  What a strange    dilemma am I driven to  nobody to advise me  Mr Warner  precipitate and fanciful in his determinations  urges me on to I know not what  Marry Mr Faulkland  receive a hand stained with—Oh the very thought is terrible   What would the world say to such an union  It cannot be  He will not sure when he comes to the use of his cooler reason insist upon a promise  which my own terror  and his desperation  extorted from me   I must try to convince Mr Warner’s judgment  I hope he will not obstinately persist in pressing me to what I dare not comply with     My brother is just come to carry me to Mr Faulkland  Heaven grant I may find him restored to his right mind     Just returned from my visit to Mr Faulkland  What a scene  He wrung my very heart  I would I had never seen him   We found him up  and walking about his room  his looks much more composed than they were last night   On our entering his chamber  his eyes sparkled with pleasure  He ran to my brother  and embraced him  Thank you my dear  dear Bidulph  said he  you at length give her to me  and with her own consent too  My bride  turning passionately to me  and snatching my hand   My brother seemed shocked  and cast his eyes mournfully at me  mine moistened  and I was obliged to apply my handkerchief to them  turning my head away   Tears  cried Mr Faulkland  in a tone of surprize  and on our wedding day  I could not bear this  I sobbed aloud  My brother was willing  if possible  to give his thoughts another turn  for not knowing what had passed the day before  he thought this was some sudden start of phrenzy   My dear
