account of all his comings and goings  When you are chatting together in his more familiar moments  never fail to lead the conversation on the subject of our sex  and then by an artful  but seemingly natural transition  take occasion to say all the good you can invent of me  Ring Euphrasia in his ears till all the house re  echoes  I would counsel you besides to keep a wary eye on all that passes in the Pacheco family  If you catch any relation of Don Gonzales sneaking about him  with a design on the inheritance  bring me word instantly  that is all you have to do  and trust me for sinking  burning  and destroying him in less than no time  I have ferreted out the weak side of all your master s relations long ago  they are each of them to be made ridiculous in some shape or other  so that the nephews and cousins  after sitting to me for their portraits  are already turned with their faces to the wall   It was evident by these instructions  with many more to the same time and tune  that Euphrasia was one of those ladies whose partialities all lean to the side of elderly inamoratos  with more money than wit  Not long before  Don Gonzales  who could refuse nothing to the tender passion  had sold an estate  and she pocketed the cash  Not a day passed  but she got some little personal remembrance out of him  and besides all this  a corner of his will was the ultimate object of her speculation  I affected to engage hand over head in their infamous plot  and if I must confess all without mental reservation  it was almost a moot point  on my return home  on which side of the cause I should take a brief  There was on either a profitable alternative  whether to join in fleecing my master  or to merit his gratitude by rescuing him from the plunderers  Con science  however  seemed to have some little concern in the determination  it was quite ridiculous to choose the by path of villany when there was a better toll to be taken on the highway of honesty  Besides  Euphrasia had dealt too much in generals  an arithmetical definition of so much for so much has more meaning in it than  all the wealth of the Indies   and to this shrewd reflection  perhaps  was owing my uncorrupted probity  Thus did I resolve to signalize my zeal in the service of Don Gonzales  in the persuasion that if I was lucky enough to disgust the worshipper by befouling his idol  it would turn to very good account  On a statement of debtor and creditor between the right and the wrong side of the action  the money balance was visibly in favour of virtue  not to mention the delights of a fair and irreproachable character   If vice so often assumes the semblance of its contrary  why should not hypocrisy now and then change sides for variety  I held myself up to Euphrasia for a thorough swindler  She was dupe enough to believe that I was incessantly talking of her to my master  and thereupon I wove a tissue of frippery and falsehood  which imposed on her for sterling truth  She had so completely given herself up to my insinuations  as to believe me her convert  her disciple  her confederate  The better still to carry on this fraud upon fraud  I affected to languish for Beatrice  and she  in ecstacy at her age to see a young fellow at her skirts  did not much trouble herself about my sincerity  if I did but play my part with vigour and address  When we were in the presence of our princesses  my master in the parlour and myself in the kitchen  the effect was that of two different pictures  but of the same school  Don Gonzales  dry as touchwood  with all its inflammability  and nothing but its smother  seemed a fitter subject for extreme unction than for amorous parley  while my little pet  in proportion to the violence of my flame  niggled  nudged  toyed  and romped  like a school girl in vacation  and no wonder she knew her lesson so pat  for the old coquette had been upwards of forty years in the form  She had finished her studies under certain professors of gallantry  whose art of pleasing becomes the more critical by practice  till they die under the accumulated experience of two or three generations   It was not enough for me to go every evening with my master to Euphrasia s  it was sometimes my lounge even in day time  But let me pop my head in at what hour I would  that forbidden creature man was never there  nor even a woman of any description  that might not be just as easily expressed as understood  There was not the least loop hole for a paramour  a circumstance not a little perplexing to one who could not readily believe  that so pretty a bale of goods could submit to a strict monopoly  by such a dealer as Don Gonzales  This opinion undoubtedly was formed on a near acquaintance with female nature  as will be apparent in the sequel  for the fair Euphrasia  while waiting for my master s translation  fortified herself with patience in
