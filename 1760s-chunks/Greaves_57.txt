tricks upon travellers—I an t now to learn my compass    Tricks   cried the knight  starting up  and laying his hand on the pummel of his sword   what  suspect my honour    Crowe  supposing him to be really incensed  interrupted him with great earnestness  saying   Nay  don t—what apize —adds buntlines —I didn t go to give you the lie  brother  smite my limbs  I only said as how to sail in the wind s eye was impossible    And I say unto thee   resumed the knight   nothing is impossible to a true knight errant  inspired and animated by love    And I say unto thee   hallooed Crowe   if so be as how love pretends to turn his hawse holes to the wind  he s no seaman  d ye see  but a snotty nosed lubberly boy  that knows not a cat from a capstan—a don t     He that does not believe that love is an infallible pilot  must not embark upon the voyage of chivalry  for  next to the protection of Heaven  it is from love that the knight derives all his prowess and glory  The bare name of his mistress invigorates his arm  the remembrance of her beauty infuses into his breast the most heroic sentiments of courage  while the idea of her chastity hedges him round like a charm  and renders him invulnerable to the sword of his antagonist  A knight without a mistress is a mere nonentity  or  at least  a monster in nature—a pilot without a compass  a ship without rudder  and must be driven to and fro upon the waves of discomfiture and disgrace     An that be all   replied the sailor   I told you before as how I ve got a sweetheart  as true a hearted girl as ever swung in canvas  What thof she may have started a hoop in rolling  that signifies nothing  I ll warrant her tight as a nut shell     She must  in your opinion  be a paragon either of beauty or virtue  Now  as you have given up the last  you must uphold her charms unequalled  and her person without a parallel    I do  I do uphold she will sail upon a parallel as well as e er a frigate that was rigged to the northward of fifty     At that rate  she must rival the attractions of her whom I adore  but that I say is impossible  The perfections of my Aurelia are altogether supernatural  and as two suns cannot shine together in the same sphere with equal splendour  so I affirm  and will prove with my body  that your mistress  in comparison with mine  is as a glow worm to the meridian sun  a rushlight to the full moon  or a stale mackerel s eye to a pearl of orient    Harkee  brother  you might give good words  however  An we once fall a jawing  d ye see  I can heave out as much bilgewater as another  and since you besmear my sweetheart  Besselia  I can as well bedaub your mistress Aurelia  whom I value no more than old junk  pork slush  or stinking stock fish     Enough  enough —such blasphemy shall not pass unchastised  In consideration of our having fed from the same table  and maintained together a friendly  though short intercourse  I will not demand the combat before you are duly prepared  Proceed to the first great town  where you can be furnished with horse and harnessing  with arms offensive and defensive  provide a trusty squire  assume a motto and device  declare yourself a son of chivalry  and proclaim the excellence of her who rules your heart  I shall fetch a compass  and wheresoever we may chance to meet  let us engage with equal arms in mortal combat  that shall decide and determine this dispute    So saying  our adventurer stalked with great solemnity into another apartment  while Crowe  being sufficiently irritated  snapped his fingers in token of defiance  Honest Crowe thought himself scurvily used by a man whom he had cultivated with such humility and veneration  and  after an incoherent ejaculation of sea oaths  went in quest of his nephew  in order to make him acquainted with this unlucky transaction   In the meantime  Sir Launcelot  having ordered supper  retired into his own chamber  and gave a loose to the most tender emotions of his heart  He recollected all the fond ideas which had been excited in the course of his correspondence with the charming Aurelia  He remembered  with horror  the cruel letter he had received from that young lady  containing a formal renunciation of his attachment  so unsuitable to the whole tenor of her character and conduct  He revolved the late adventure of the coach  and the declaration of Mr  Clarke  with equal eagerness and astonishment  and was seized with the most ardent desire of unravelling a mystery so interesting to the predominant passion of his heart  All these mingled considerations produced a kind of ferment in the economy of his mind  which subsided into a profound reverie  compounded of hope and perplexity   From
