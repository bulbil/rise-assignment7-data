yours  c            B  MUNDEN        This was the first love letter she had ever wrote  and it must be owned   that the passion she was inspired with had already made her a pretty   good proficient that way  but though the prudish part of the sex may   perhaps accuse her of having confessed too much  yet those of a more   reasonable way of thinking will be far from pronouncing sentence against   her  the person of Mr  Trueworth  his admirable endowments  the services   he had done her  might well warrant the tenderness she had for him  his   birth  his estate  his good character  and her own experience of his   many virtues  sufficiently authorized her acceptance of his offers  and   it would have been only a piece of idle affectation in her to have gone   about to have concealed her regard for a person whom so many reasons   induced her to marry  especially as chance had so long before betrayed   to him her inclinations in his favour       Thus fully justified within herself  and assured of being so hereafter   to all her friends  and to the world in general  she indulged the most   pleasing ideas of her approaching happiness  without the least mixture   of any of those inquietudes  which pride  folly  ill fortune  or   ill humour  too frequently excite  to poison all the sweets of love and   imbitter the most tender passion       As she had not made Lady Trusty the confidante of any part of what had   passed between her and Mr  Trueworth  deterred at first through shame    and afterwards by the uncertainty of his persisting in his addresses    that lady would have been greatly surprized at the extraordinary   vivacity which now on a sudden sparkled in her eyes  if there had not   been other motives besides the real one by which she might account for   it       Mrs  Munden had received intelligence that Lady Loveit was safely   delivered of a son and heir  and  what was yet more interesting to her    that Mr  Thoughtless was married to a young lady of a large fortune  and   honourable family  letters also came from Mr  Francis Thoughtless    acquainting them that he had obtained leave from his colonel to leave   the regiment for two whole months  and that  after the celebration of   his brother s nuptials  he would pass the remainder of his furlow with   them in L    e       These  indeed  were the things which at another time would have highly   delighted the mind of Mrs  Munden  but at this her thoughts were so   absorbed in Mr  Trueworth  whom she now every hour expected  that   friendship  and even that natural affection which had hitherto been so   distinguishable a part of her character  could not boast of but a second   place       Lady Trusty observing her one day in a more than ordinarily chearful   humour  took that opportunity of discoursing with her on a matter which   had been in her head for some time   Mr  Munden has been dead a year     said she   you have paid all that regard to his memory which could have   been expected from you  even for a better husband  and cannot now be   blamed for listening to any offers that may be made to your   advantage     Offers  Madam   cried Mrs  Munden   on what score does   your ladyship mean     What others can you suppose   relied she gravely     than those of marriage  There are two gentleman who have solicited both   Sir Ralph and myself to use our best interest with you in their behalf    neither of them are unworthy your consideration  the one is Mr    Woodland  whom you have frequently seen here  his estate at present    indeed  is no more than eight hundred pounds a year  but he has great   expectations from a rich uncle  the other is our vicar  who  besides two   large benefices  has lately had a windfall of near a thousand pounds a   year by the death of his elder brother  and it is the opinion of most   people  that he will be made a bishop on the first vacancy         So much the worse  Madam   said the spiritous Mrs  Munden   for if he   takes the due care he ought to do of his diocese  he will have little   time to think of his wife  as to Mr  Woodland  indeed  I have but one   objection to make  but that is a main one  I do not like him  and
