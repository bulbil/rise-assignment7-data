to settle as a surgeon in Bohemia    In the course of these inquiries  several years elapsed  his uncle  who  was very much attached to the house of Austria  lived at Barcelona when  the father of this empress queen resided in that city  and lent him a  very considerable sum of money in the most pressing emergency of his  affairs  and when that prince was on the point of returning to Germany   the old count  finding his end approaching  sent his father confessor  to his majesty  with a circumstantial account of the barbarity he had  practised against his nephew  for which he implored forgiveness  and  begged he would give orders  that the orphan  when found  should inherit  the dignities and fortune which he had unjustly usurped    His majesty assured the old man  that he might make himself easy  on that score  and ordered the confessor to follow him to Vienna   immediately after the count s death  in order to assist his endeavours  in finding out the injured heir  The priest did not fail to yield  obedience to this command  He informed himself of certain natural marks  on the young count s body  which were known to the nurse and women who  attended him in his infancy  and  with a gentleman whom the emperor  ordered to accompany him  set out for Bohemia  where he soon found the  object of his inquiry  in the capacity of major domo to a nobleman  of that country  he having quitted his profession of surgery for that  office    He was not a little surprised  when he found himself circumstantially  catechised about the particulars of his life  by persons commissioned  for that purpose by the emperor  He told them  that he was absolutely    6 22 15  3 45 PM   ignorant of his own birth  though he had been informed  during his  residence in Turkey  that he was the bastard of a Spanish grandee   and gave them a minute detail of the pilgrimage he had undergone  This  information agreeing with the intelligence which the priest had already  received  and being corroborated by the marks upon his body  and the  very scars of the wounds which had been inflicted upon him in his  infancy  the confessor  without further hesitation  saluted him by  the name of Count d Alvarez  grandee of Spain  and explained the whole  mystery of his fortune    If he was agreeably amazed at this explanation  the case was otherwise  with his wife  who thought herself in great danger of being abandoned  by a husband of such high rank  but he immediately dispelled her  apprehension  by assuring her  that  as she had shared in his adversity   she should also partake of his good fortune  He set out immediately for  Vienna  to make his acknowledgments to the emperor  who favoured him  with a very gracious reception  promised to use his influence  so that  he might enjoy the honours and estate of his family  and in the meantime  acknowledged himself his debtor for four hundred thousand florins  which  he had borrowed from his uncle  He threw himself at the feet of his  august protector  expressed the most grateful sense of his goodness  and  begged he might be permitted to settle in some of his imperial majesty s  dominions  This request was immediately granted  he was allowed to  purchase land in any part of the hereditary dominions of the house of  Austria  to the amount of the sum I have mentioned  and made choice of  the country of Ratibor  in Silesia  where  in all probability  he still  resides    Peregrine had scarce finished the narrative  when he perceived Mr  M    slip something into the hand of the young man with whom he had been  conversing at the other end of the room  and rise up from the table  in order to take his leave  He at once understood the meaning of this  conveyance  and longed for an opportunity to be acquainted with such  a rare instance of primitive benevolence  but the consciousness of his  present situation hindered him from making any advance that might be  construed into forwardness or presumption   CHAPTER XCIX   He is surprised with the Appearance of Hatchway and Pipes  who take up  their Habitation in his Neighbourhood  contrary to his Inclination and  express Desire   Being now regularly initiated in the mysteries of the Fleet  and  reconciled in some measure to the customs of the place  he began to bear  the edge of reflection without wincing  and thinking it would be highly  imprudent in him to defer any longer the purposes by which only he  could enjoy any ease and satisfaction in his confinement  he resolved  to resume his task of translating  and every week compose an occasional  paper  by way of revenge upon the minister  against whom he had  denounced eternal war  With this view  he locked himself up in his  chamber  and went to work with great eagerness and application  when he    6 22 15  3
