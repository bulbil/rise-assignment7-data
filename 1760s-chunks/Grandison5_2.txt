 resumed the Marchioness  We shall only be attended by Laura and Camilla   Page  4 Just then entered the sweet Lady  leaning upon Camilla  Laura attending  Her movement was slow and solemn  Her eyes were cast on the ground  Her robes were black and flowing  A veil of black gause half covered her face  What woe was there in it   What  at that moment  was my emotion  I arose from my seat  sat down  and arose again  irresolute  not knowing what I did  or what to do   She stopt in the middle of the floor  and made some motion  in silence  to Camilla  who adjusted her veil  But she looked not before her  lifted not up her eyes  observed no body   On her stopping  I was advancing towards her  but the General took my hand  Sit still  sit still  dear Grandison  said he  Yet I am charmed with your sensibility  She comes  She moves towards us   She approached the table round which we sat  her eyes more than half closed  and cast down  She turned to go towards the window  Here  here  madam  said Camilla  leading her to an elbow chair that had been placed for her  between the two Marchionesses  She implicitly took her woman s directions  and sat down  Her mother wept  The young Marchioness wept  Her father sobbed  and looked from her  Her mother took her hand  My love  said she  look around you   Pray  sister  said the Count  her uncle  leave her to her own observation   She was regardless of what either said  her eyes were cast down  and half closed  Camilla stood at the back of her chair   The General  grieved and impatient  arose  and stepping to her  My dearest sister  said he  hanging over her shoulder  look upon us all  Do not scorn us  do not despise us  See your father  your mother  your sister  and every body  in tears  If you love us  smile upon us  He took the hand which her mother had quitted  to attend her own emotions   Page  5 She reared up her eyes to him  and  sweetly condescending  tried to smile  but such a solemnity had taken possession of her features  that she only could shew her obligingness  by the effort  Her smile was a smile of woe  And  still further to shew her compliance  withdrawing her hand from her brother  she looked on either side of her  and seeing which was her mother  she  with both hands  took hers  and bowed her head upon upon it   The Marquis arose from his seat  his handkerchief at his eyes  Sweet creature  said he  never  never let me again see such a smile as that  It is here  putting his hand to his breast   Camilla offered her a glass of limonade  she accepted it not  nor held up her head for a few moments   Obliging sister  you do not scorn us  said the General  See  Father Marescotti is in tears  The reverend man sat next me   Pity his grey hairs  See  my Lord  your own father too—Comfort your father  His grief for your silence —  She cast her eyes that way  She saw me  Saw me greatly affected  She started  She looked again  again started  and quitting her mother s hand  now changing pale  now reddening  she arose  and threw her arms about her Camilla—O Camilla  was all she said  a violent burst of tears wounding  yet giving some ease to every heart  I was springing to her  and should have clasped her in my arms before them all  but the General taking my hand  as I reached her chair  Dear Grandison  said he  pronouncing in her ear my name  keep your seat  If Clementina remembers her English tutor  she will bid you welcome once more to Bologna —O Camilla  said she  faithful  good Camilla  Now  at last  have you told me truth  It is  it is he —And her tears would flow  as she hid her face in Camilla s bosom   The General s native pride again shewed itself  He Page  6 took me aside  I see  Grandison  the consequence you are of to this unhappy girl  Every one sees it  But I depend upon your honour  You remember what you said this morning—  Good God  said I  with some emotion  I stopt—And resuming  with pride equal to his own  Know  Sir  that the man whom you thus remind  calls himself a man of honour  and you  as well as the rest of the world  shall find him so   He seemed a little abashed  I was flinging from him  not too angrily for him  but for the rest of the company  had they not been attentive to the motions of their Clementina   We  however  took the Bishop s eye  He came to us   I left the General
