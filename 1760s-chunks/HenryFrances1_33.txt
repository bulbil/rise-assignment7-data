to apprehend   104 from her  for she is not one I love  but only one who loves me  In short  she has taken a most unnatural Affection to me  for every other Cat in the House flies for it  when I appear  but Sultana Puss  from a Kitten  has sollicited my Regards  followed me about the House  and mewed at the Door  when I was shut up in my Room  She lay with me too for some Time   till her Snoring disturbed me  She is an odd Animal also  in other Respects  for she really is very low spirited sometimes  and her Nerves are so weak  which I attribute to her Drinking Tea in a Morning  without Eating  that the least loud Word sets her trembling  so that I dare not chide an aukward House maid  for Fear of putting Madam into one of her Hysterics  I design taking her to Town with me  for Advice of Physicians  and perhaps a Creature  which is reported to have nine Lives  may at length find Benefit from their kill or cure Prescriptions   I have often laughed at the Simplicity of Montaigne playing with his Cat  but shall hence forward accept him among the Philosophers   Mai Chere  adieu   Et croyez vous  Que je suis   Sans contredit   Le plus fidele de vos Amis     105  LETTER LXI   I Am extremely glad to find my dear Harry a Votary to Montaigne  he was always a Favourite of mine  and I am greatly surprized that I never thought of introducing him in our epistolatory Conversations  I know not whether he is numbered among the Philosophers  but I think the very Amusement  which you have copied from him  speaks him a more practical one than any I have heard of  For  as to subdue our Passions is the End of all Philosophy  he gave the highest Proof of having reduced his to a perfect Calm  when he was content with so trifling an Employment as Fiddling with his Cat  However I have yet one Doubt  which possibly may derogate from his Merit  whether he had not passed his grand Climacteric  before he found out this charming Amusement  I have often been delighted with him  even when I was a Child  for remarking    That there is a certain general Claim of Kindness and Benevolence  which every Species of Creatures has a Right to from us   And think it much to be regretted  that this generous Maxim is not more attended to  in the Affair of Education  for this Reason  I admire you for endeavouring to obtain the best Advice you can  for the Recovery of your Favourite s Health  since the most refined Philosophy allows that we have Reason to believe the   106 Sensations of small Animals and Insects are  in some Cases  as exquisite as those of Creatures of far more inlarged Dimensions  My darling Shakespear seems to be of this Opinion  when he says   The poor Beetle that we tread upon  in corp ral Sufferance  feels a Pang as great  as when a Giant dies   But what amazes me is  that you  who love Retirement so much  have not found out a more rational Companion than your Cat  for I am of Balsac s Opinion   Que la solitude est certainement une belle chose  Mais il y a plaisir d avoir quelqu un  qui en sçache repondre  a qui on puisse dire  de tems en tems  que la solitude est une belle chose   —But I must not forget  that  as I often wish for your Company  you may as often wish to be alone  and that I may perhaps be  at this Instant  breaking in upon one of those Hours  which you desire to enjoy without Interruption  I shall no longer detain you  than while I add  that I am  and ever shall be     affectionately yours  Frances     107  LETTER LXII   Dear FANNY   THE Rain overtook me at —  and there I wished for you  as I fear I should have done  though you had been present  in vain all Night  the life long Night  Between that Stage and this  the Rain so moistened my Clay again this Morning  that here I am obliged to wish for you  both Day and Night  but  in which Term I desire you most  I do assure you  I am sometimes doubtful  for you alone of all your Sex  young and handsome  ever brought it any thing near a moot Point  whether I should chuse the Possession of your Love  or Friendship  if  by naming one  I should be precluded from the other  In such a Dilemma  I should consider myself  like the Paradise of Erasmus  suspended between Heaven and Hell  for tho  Enjoyment  either of your Conversation or Person  would be Heaven to me  the Deprivation of either would be Hell  This Equality of Sentiment is not owing to any Luckiness in my Composition  setting the Balance between the Rationale and Irrationale of my Constitution  but to your extraordinary Merit  which makes me think the Enjoyment of your Person would be
