see the force of habitual piety  Tho  not so good as I should be myself  I revere those who are so  and that I hope you will own is no bad sign   Well  but now for ourselves  and those about us   Lady Olivia has written Lady L  a Letter from Windsor  It is in French  extremely polite  She promises to write to me from Oxford   Lady Anne S  made me a visit this morning  She was more concerned than I wished to see her  on my confirming the report she had heard of my brother s being gone abroad  I railled her a little too freely  as it was before Lord G  and Lord L  I never was better rebuked than by her  for she took out her pencil  and on the cover of a letter wrote these lines from Shakespeare  and slid them into my hand   And will you rend our ancient Love asunder   To join with Men  in scorning your poor friend   It is not friendly   tis not maidenly   Our Sex  as well as I  may chide you for it   Tho  I alone do feel the injury   I never  my dear  told you how freely this Lady and I had talked of Love  But freely as we had talked    230 I was not aware that the matter lay so deep in her heart  I knew not how to tell her that my brother had said  It could not be  I could have wept over her when I read this paper  and I owned myself by a whisper justly rebuked  She charged me not to let any man see this  particularly not either of those present  And do you  Harriet  keep what I have written of Lady Anne to yourself   My aunt Eleanor has written a congratulatory Letter to me from York  Sir Charles  it seems  had acquainted her with Lord G s day  Not my day  Harriet  that is not the phrase  I hope   as soon as he knew it himself  and she writes  supposing that I was actually offered on it  Women are victims on these occasions  I hope you ll allow me that  My brother has made it a point of duty to acquaint his father s sister with every matter of consequence to the family  and now  she says  that both her nieces are so well disposed of  she will come to town very quickly to see her new relations and us  and desires we will make room for her  And yet she owns  that my brother has informed her of his being obliged to go abroad  and she supposes him gone  As he is the beloved of her heart  I wonder she thinks of making this visit now he is absent  But we shall all be glad to see my aunt Nell  She is a good creature  tho  an old maid  I hope the old Lady has not utterly lost either her invention  or memory  and then  between both  I shall be entertained with a great number of Love stories of the last age  and perhaps of some dangers and escapes  which may serve for warnings for Emily  Alas  alas  they will come too late for your Charlotte   I have written already the longest Letter that I ever wrote in my life  Yet it is prating  and to you  to whom I love to prate  I have not near done   You bid me be good  and you threaten me  if I am not  with the ill opinion of all your friends  But I have such an unaccountable biass for roguery  or what   231 shall I call it  that I believe it is impossible for me to take your advice  I have been examining myself  What a duce is the matter with me  that I cannot see my honest man in the same advantageous light in which he appears to every body else  Yet I do not  in my heart  dislike him  On the contrary  I know not  were I to look about me  far and wide  the man I would have wished to have called mine  rather than him  But he is so important about trifles  so nimble  yet so slow  He is so sensible of his own intention to please  and has so many antic motions in his obligingness  that I cannot forbear laughing at the very time that I ought perhaps to reward him with a gracious approbation   I must fool on a little while longer  I believe  Permit me  Harriet  so to do  as occasions arise   AN instance  an instance in point  Harriet  Let me laugh as I write  I did it at the time —What do you laugh at  Charlotte —Why this poor man  or  as I should rather say  this Lord and Master of mine  has just left me  He has been making me both a compliment  and a present  And what do you think the compliment is  Why▪ if I please  he will give away to a virtuoso friend  his collection of Moths and Butterflies  I once  he remember d
