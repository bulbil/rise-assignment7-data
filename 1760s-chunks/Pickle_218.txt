could  even at that time  look upon her with impunity   And as Peregrine saw her attractions heightened by the tender office in  which she was engaged  he was smitten with her beauty  and so ravished  with her compassion  that he could not suppress his emotions  but  applauded her benevolence with all the warmth of enthusiasm   Her ladyship received his compliments with great politeness and  affability  And the occasion on which they met being equally interesting  to both  an acquaintance commenced between them  and they concerted  measures for the benefit of the widow and her two children  one of whom  our hero bespoke for his own godson  for Pickle was not so obscure in  the beau monde  but that his fame had reached the ears of this lady   who  therefore  did not discourage his advances towards her friendship  and esteem  All the particulars relating to their charge being adjusted   he attended her ladyship to her own house  and  by her conversation   had the pleasure of finding her understanding suitable to her other  accomplishments  Nor had she any reason to think that our hero s  qualifications had been exaggerated by common report   One of their adopted children died before it was baptized  so that  their care concentred in the other  for whom they stood sponsors   Understanding that the old agent was becoming troublesome in his visits  to the mother  to whom he now began to administer such counsel as  shocked the delicacy of her virtue  they removed her into another  lodging  where she would not be exposed to his machinations  In less  than a month  our hero learned from a nobleman of his acquaintance   that the hoary pander had actually engaged to procure for him this  poor afflicted gentlewoman  and  being frustrated in his intention   substituted in her room a nymph from the purlieus of Covent Garden  that  made his lordship smart severely for the favours she bestowed   Meanwhile  Peregrine cultivated his new acquaintance with all his art  and assiduity  presuming  from the circumstances of her reputation and  fate  as well as on the strength of his own merit  that  in time  he  should be able to indulge that passion which had begun to glow within  his breast  As her ladyship had undergone a vast variety of fortune  and adventure  which he had heard indistinctly related  with numberless    6 22 15  3 45 PM   errors and misrepresentations  he was no sooner entitled  by the  familiarity of communication  to ask such a favour  than he earnestly  entreated her to entertain him with the particulars of her story  and   by dint of importunity  she was at length prevailed upon  in a select  party  to gratify his curiosity  by the account given in the following  chapter   CHAPTER LXXXI   The Memoirs of a Lady of Quality    By the circumstances of the story which I am going to relate  you will  be convinced of my candour  while you are informed of my indiscretion   You will be enabled  I hope  to perceive  that  howsoever my head may  have erred  my heart hath always been uncorrupted  and that I have been  unhappy  because I loved  and was a woman    I believe I need not observe  that I was the only child of a man of  good fortune  who indulged me in my infancy with all the tenderness of  paternal affection  and  when I was six years old  sent me to a private  school  where I stayed till my age was doubled  and became such a  favourite  that I was  even in those early days  carried to all the  places of public diversion  the court itself not excepted  an indulgence  that flattered my love of pleasure  to which I was naturally addicted   and encouraged those ideas of vanity and ambition which spring up so  early in the human mind    I was lively and good natured  my imagination apt to run riot  my heart  liberal and disinterested  though I was so obstinately attached to my  own opinions  that I could not well brook contradiction  and  in the  whole of my disposition  resembled that of Henry V   as described by  Shakespeare    In my thirteenth year I went to Bath  where I was first introduced  into the world as a woman  having been entitled to that privilege by my  person  which was remarkably tall for my years  and there my fancy was  quite captivated by the variety of diversions in which I was continually  engaged  Not that the parties were altogether new to me  but because I  now found myself considered as a person of consequence  and surrounded  by a crowd of admirers  who courted my acquaintance  and fed my vanity  with praise and adulation  In short  whether or not I deserved their  encomiums  I leave the world to judge  but my person was commended  and  my talent in dancing met with universal applause  No wonder  then   that
