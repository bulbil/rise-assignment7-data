tell me what Anne says  on your being so much affected  when she tolls you in an hurry that your guardian is come   Why Anne says  That all those are signs of Love  Foolish creature —And yet so they may  But not of such Love as she means —Such a Love as she as good as owns she had in her days of slutteration  as she whimsically calls them  which  as she explains it  were when she was two or three years older than I am  In the first place  I am very young  you know  madam  a mere girl  And such a simple thing —I never had a mother  nor sister neither  nor a companion of my own sex —Mrs  Lane s daughters  what were they —They looked upon me as a child as I was  In the next place  I do love my guardian  that s true  but with as much reverence  as if he were my father  I never had a thought that had not that deep  that profound reverence for him  as I remember I had for my father     51 But you had not  my dear  any of those flutters  those throbs  that you spoke of  on any returns of your father  after little absences   Why  no  I can t say I had  Nor  tho  I always rejoiced when my guardian came to see me at Mrs  Lane s  had I  as I remember  any such violent emotions  as I have had now of late  I don t know how it is—Can you tell me   Do you not  Lucy  both love and pity this sweet girl   My dear Emily —These are symptoms  I doubt—  Symptoms of what  madam —Pray tell me sincerely  I will not hide a thought of my heart from you   If encouraged  my dear—  What then  madam —  It would be Love  I doubt —That sort of Love that would make you uneasy—  No  that cannot be surely  Why  madam  at that rate  I should never dare to stand in your presence  Upon my word  I wish no one in the world  but you  to be lady Grandison  I have but one fear—  And what is that   That my guardian won t love me so well  when he marries  as he does now   Are you afraid that the woman he marries will endeavour to narrow so large an heart as his   No  not if that woman were you —But  forgive my folly   and she looked down  he would not take my hand so kindly as now he does  He would not look in my face with pleasure  and with pity on my mother s account  as he does now  He would not call me his Emily  He would not bespeak ever one s regard for his ward   My dear  you are now almost a woman  He will  if he remain a single man  soon draw back into his heart that kindness and love for you  which  while you   52 are a girl  he suffers to dwell upon his lips  You must expect this change of behaviour soon  from his prudence  You yourself  my love  will set him the example  You will grow more reserved in your outward behaviour  than hitherto there was reason to be—  O  madam  never tell me that  I should break my heart  were I twenty  and he did not treat me with the tenderness that he has always treated me with  If  indeed  he find me an incroacher  if he find me forward  and indiscreet  and troublesome  then let him call me any  body s Emily  rather than his   You will have different notions  my dear  before that time—  Then  I think  I sha n t desire to live to see the time  Why  madam  all the comfort I have to set against my unhappiness from my mother  is  that so good  so virtuous  and so prudent a man as Sir Charles Grandison  calls me his Emily  and loves me as his child  Would you  madam  were you Lady Grandison  now  tell me  would you  grudge me these instances of his favour and affection   Indeed  my dear  I would not  If I know my own heart  I would not   And would you permit me to live with you —Now it is out—Will you permit me to live with my guardian and you —This is a question I wanted to put to you  but was both ashamed and afraid  till you thus kindly emboldened me   Indeed I would  if your guardian had no objection   That don t satisfy me  madam  Would you be my earnest  my sincere advocate  and plead for me  He would not deny you any thing  And would you  come  madam  I will put you to it—Would you  say     Look you here  Sir Charles Grandison  This girl  this Emily  is a good sort of girl  She has a great fortune
