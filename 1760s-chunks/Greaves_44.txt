hundred men to save us from perdition  unless we paid an extravagant price for their assistance    But  to return to this here Elixir of Long Life  I might embellish it with a great many high sounding epithets  but I disdain to follow the example of every illiterate vagabond  that  from idleness  turns quack  and advertises his nostrum in the public papers  I am neither a felonious drysalter returned from exile  an hospital stump turner  a decayed staymaker  a bankrupt printer  or insolvent debtor  released by act of parliament  I do not pretend to administer medicines without the least tincture of letters  or suborn wretches to perjure themselves in false affidavits of cures that were never performed  nor employ a set of led captains to harangue in my praise at all public places  I was bred regularly to the profession of chemistry  and have tried all the processes of alchemy  and I may venture to say  that this here elixir is  in fact  the chruseon pepuromenon ek puros  the visible  glorious  spiritual body  from whence all other beings derive their existence  as proceeding from their father the sun  and their mother the moon  from the sun  as from a living and spiritual gold  which is mere fire  consequently  the common and universal first created mover  from whence all moveable things have their distinct and particular motions  and also from the moon  as from the wife of the sun  and the common mother of all sublunary things    And forasmuch as man is  and must be  the comprehensive end of all creatures  and the microcosm  he is counselled in the Revelation to buy gold that is thoroughly fired  or rather pure fire  that he may become rich and like the sun  as  on the contrary  he becomes poor  when he abuses the arsenical poison  so that  his silver  by the fire  must be calcined to a caput mortuum  which happens when he will hold and retain the menstruum  out of which he partly exists  for his own property  and doth not daily offer up the same in the fire of the sun  that the woman may be clothed with the sun  and become a sun  and thereby rule over the moon  that is to say  that he may get the moon under his feet  Now  this here elixir  sold for no more than sixpence a phial  contains the essence of the alkahest  the archaeus  the catholicon  the menstruum  the sun  the moon  and  to sum up all in one word  is the true  genuine  unadulterated  unchangeable  immaculate  and specific chruseon pepuromenon ek puros    The audience were variously affected by this learned oration  Some of those who favoured the pretensions of the Whig candidate  were of opinion  that he ought to be punished for his presumption  in reflecting so scurrilously on ministers and measures  Of this sentiment was our adventurer  though he could not help admiring the courage of the orator  and owning within himself  that he had mixed some melancholy truths with his scurrility   Mr  Ferret would not have stood so long in his rostrum unmolested  had not he cunningly chosen his station immediately without the jurisdiction of the town  whose magistrates therefore could not take cognisance of his conduct  but application was made to the constable of the other parish  while our nostrum monger proceeded in his speech  the conclusion of which produced such an effect upon his hearers  that his whole cargo was immediately exhausted  He had just stepped down from his stool  when the constable with his staff arrived  and took him under his guidance  Mr  Ferret  on this occasion  attempted to interest the people in his behalf  by exhorting them to vindicate the liberty of the subject against such an act of oppression  but finding them deaf to the tropes and figures of his elocution  he addressed himself to our knight  reminding him of his duty to protect the helpless and the injured  and earnestly soliciting his interposition   Sir Launcelot  without making the least reply to his entreaties  resolved to see the end of this adventure  and  being joined by his squire  followed the prisoner at a distance  measuring back the ground he had travelled the day before  until he reached another small borough  where Ferret was housed in the common prison   While he sat a horseback  deliberating on the next step he should take  he was accosted by the voice of Tom Clarke  who called  in a whimpering tone  through a window grated with iron   For the love of God  Sir Launcelot  do  dear sir  be so good as to take the trouble to alight  and come upstairs  I have something to communicate  of consequence to the community in general  and you in particular  Pray do  dear Sir Knight  I beg a boon in the name of St  Michael and St  George for England    Our adventurer  not a little surprised at this address  dismounted without hesitation  and  being admitted to the common jail  there found not only his old friend Tom  but also the uncle  sitting on a bench
