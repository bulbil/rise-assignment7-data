imperial brow and voice of the   Great Mogul  Ned cast upon him an eye of such significant con    tempt  as no submissions or suflerings  on the part of the offender    could ever after compensate      The next day Mr  Vindex returned  doubly armed  with a mon    strous birch rod in one hand  and a ferule in the other  The first   he hung up  in terrorem  as a meteor is said to hang in the heavens    threatening future castigation to the children of men  The second   he held as determined upon present action   nor was he unmindful   of any hook whereon to hang a fault  so that  travelling from right   to left and from left to right  he so warmed the hands of the un    fortunate Edward  as ruined the sunny economy of his countenance    and reduced him to a disagreeable partnership with the afflicted      On the departure of Vindex  though Ned s drollery was dismayed    his resentment was by no means eradicated  for the principle of   Ned was wholly agreeable to the motto of a very noble escutcheon     and Nemo me impune lace ssit was a maxim of whose impropriety not   St  Anthony himself could persuade him      All night he lay ruminating and brooding on mischief in his   imagination   and having formed the outlines of his plan toward   morning  he began to chuckle and comfort himself  and exult in the   execution  He then revealed his project to his bedfellow  Mr    James  who was greatly tickled therewith  and promised to join in   the plot      Full against the portal that opened upon the schoolroom  there   stood an ancient and elevated chair  whose form was sufficiently   expressive of its importance  Mr  Vindex had selected this ma    jestic piece of furniture as alone suitable to the dignity of his   exalted station   for he judiciously considered that  if thrones and   benches were taken from among men  there would be an end of all   dominion and justice upon earth      Through the centre of the seat of this chair of authority  Ned   got Mr  James to drill a small hole  not discernible except on a   very minute scrutiny  He then provided a cylindrical stick of   about six inches in length  to one end of which he fastened a   piece of lead  and in the other end he fixed the end of a large   needle  This needle had been a glover s  of approved metal  keen   and polished  and three square toward the point  for a quick and   ready penetration of tough leather  He next fastened two small   cords transversely to the leaden extremity of the stick   and  James   assisting  they turned the chair with the bottom upward  and   tacked the four ends of the cords in such a manner as answered to   the four cardinal points of the compass   while the stick remained   suspended in an upward direction  with the point of the needle just   so far through the drill  as put it upon a level with the surface   of the seat  Lastly  they fastened a long and well waxed thread   about the middle of the stick  and drawing this thread over the   upper rung  they dropped the end of it just under Ned s stool  and   replaced the seat of learning in its former position      Greatly did Ned parade it  when on trial he found that his   machine answered to a miracle  for the stick being restrained               THE FOOL OF QUALITY  59     from any motion  save that in a direction to the zenith  on the   slightest twitch of the thread the needle instantly mounted four    sixths of two inches above the surface of the seat  and was quickly   recalled by the revulsion of the lead      At the appointed hour of magisterial approach  in comes Mr    Vindex  Master Harry and Ned are called  Each seizes his book    and takes his seat as usual in a line  nearly diagonal to the right   and left corner of the chair of authority  Mr  Vindex assumes the   throne   but scarce was he crowned when Ned gives the premedi    tated intimation to his piercer  and up bounces Vindex  and gives two   or three capers as though he had been suddenly stung by a tarantula    He stares wildly about puts his hand behind him with a touch of   tender condolence returns to the chair peers all over it with   eyes of the most prying inspection   but  not trusting to the   testimony of his ocular sense in a case that so
