a whole hog sty in an uproar   When he had examined and applauded all the productions of this minute  artist  they returned to the great church  and were entertained with  the view of that celebrated masterpiece of Rubens  in which he has  introduced the portraits of himself and his whole family  The doors  that conceal this capital performance were no sooner unfolded  than our  enthusiast  debarred the use of speech  by a previous covenant with his  friend Pickle  lifted up his hands and eyes  and putting himself in the  attitude of Hamlet  when his father s ghost appears  adored in silent  ecstasy and awe  He even made a merit of necessity  and  when they  had withdrawn from the place  protested that his whole faculties were  swallowed up in love and admiration  He now professed himself more than  ever enamoured of the Flemish school  raved in extravagant encomiums   and proposed that the whole company should pay homage to the memory  of the divine Rubens  by repairing forthwith to the house in which he  lived  and prostrating themselves on the floor of his painting room   As there was nothing remarkable in the tenement  which had been rebuilt  more than once since the death of that great man  Peregrine excused  himself from complying with the proposal  on pretence of being fatigued  with the circuit they had already performed  Jolter declined it for the  same reason  and the question being put to the doctor  he refused his  company with an air of disdain  Pallet  piqued at his contemptuous  manner  asked   if he would not go and see the habitation of Pindoor   provided he was in the city where that poet lived   and when the  physician observed  that there was an infinite difference between the  men   That I ll allow   replied the painter   for the devil a poet ever  lived in Greece or Troy  that was worthy to clean the pencils of our  beloved Rubens   The physician could not  with any degree of temper  and forbearance  hear this outrageous blasphemy  for which  he said   Pallet s eyes ought to be picked out by owls  and the dispute arose   as usual  to such scurrilities of language  and indecency of behaviour   that passengers began to take notice of their animosity  and Peregrine  was obliged to interpose for his own credit   CHAPTER LXIII   Peregrine artfully foments a Quarrel between Pallet and the Physician   who fight a Duel on the Ramparts   The painter betook himself to the house of the Flemish Raphael  and  the rest of the company went back to their lodgings  where the young  gentleman  taking the advantage of being alone with the physician   recapitulated all the affronts he had sustained from the painter s  petulance  aggravating every circumstance of the disgrace  and advising  him  in the capacity of a friend  to take care of his honour  which  could not fail to suffer in the opinion of the world  if he allowed  himself to be insulted with impunity  by one so much his inferior in  every degree of consideration     6 22 15  3 45 PM   The physician assured him  that Pallet had hitherto escaped  chastisement  by being deemed an object unworthy his resentment  and  in consideration of the wretch s family  for which his compassion was  interested  but that repeated injuries would inflame the most benevolent  disposition  And  though he could find no precedent of duelling among  the Greeks and Romans  whom he considered as the patterns of demeanour   Pallet should no longer avail himself of his veneration for the  ancients  but be punished for the very next offence he should commit   Having thus spirited up the doctor to a resolution from which he could  not decently swerve  our adventurer acted the incendiary with the other  party also  giving him to understand  that the physician treated his  character with such contempt  and behaved to him with such insolence  as  no gentleman ought to bear  that  for his own part  he was every day put  out of countenance by their mutual animosity  which appeared in nothing  but vulgar expressions  more becoming shoe boys and oyster women  than men of honour and education  and therefore he should be obliged   contrary to his inclination  to break off all correspondence with them  both  if they would not fall upon some method to retrieve the dignity of  their characters   These representations would have had little effect upon the timidity of  the painter  who was likewise too much of a Grecian to approve of single  combat  in any other way than that of boxing  an exercise in which he  was well skilled  had they not been accompanied with an insinuation   that his antagonist was no Hector  and that he might humble him into any  concession  without running the least personal risk  Animated by this  assurance  our second Rubens set the trumpet of defiance to his mouth   swore he valued not his life a rush  when his honour
