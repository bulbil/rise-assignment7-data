descend so far below the dignity of a gentleman  as to fight like a porter  but if he had any thing to say to me  I was his man at blunderbuss  musket  pistol  sword  hatchet  spit  cleaver  fork or needle —nay more  that if he gave his tongue any more saucy liberties at my expence  I would crop his ears without any ceremony —This rhodomontade delivered   34 with a stern countenance  and resolute tone  had the desired effect upon my antagonist  who  with some confusion  sneaked off  and gave his friend an account of his reception —The story taking air among the servants  procured for me the title of Gentleman John  with which I was sometimes honoured  even by my mistress and Narcissa  who had been informed of the whole affair by the chamber maid —In the mean time  the rival queens expressed their passion by all the ways in their power  The cook entertained me with choice bits  the dairy maid with stroakings  the first would often encourage me to declare myself  by complimenting me upon my courage and learning  and observing  that if she had a husband like me  to maintain order and keep accounts  she could make a great deal of money by setting up an eating house at London  for gentlemen s servants on board wages —The other courted my affection  by shewing her own importance  and telling me  that many a substantial farmer in the neighbourhood would be glad to marry her  but she was resolved to please her eye  if she should plague her heart —Then she would launch out into the praise of my proper person  and say  she was sure I would make a good husband  for I was very good natured —I began to be uneasy at the importunities of these inamoratas  whom at another time  perhaps  I might have pleased without the disagreeable sauce of matrimony  but at present  my whole soul was engrossed by Narcissa  and I could not bear the thoughts of doing any thing derogatory of the passion I entertained for her     35  CHAP  XLI    Narcissa being in danger from the brutality of Sir Timothy  is rescued by me  who revenge myself on my rival—I declare my passion  and retreat to the sea side—I am surrounded by smugglers  and carried to Bulloign—I find my uncle lieutenant Bowling  in great distress  and relieve him—our conversation   AT certain intervals  my ambition would revive  I would despise myself for my tame resignation to my sordid fate  and revolve an hundred schemes for assuming the character of a gentleman  to which I was intitled by birth and education —In these fruitless suggestions  time stole away unperceived  and I had already remained eight months in the station of a footman  when an accident happened  that put an end to my servitude  and for the present banished all hopes of succeeding in my love   Narcissa went one day to visit Miss Thicket  who lived with her brother  within less than a mile of our house  and was persuaded to walk home in the cool of the evening  accompanied by Sir Timothy  who having a good deal of the brute in him  was instigated to use some unbecoming familiarities with her  encouraged by the solitariness of a field through which they passed —The lovely creature was incensed at his rude behaviour  for which she reproached him in such   36 a manner  that he lost all regard for decency  and actually offered violence to this pattern of innocence and beauty —But heaven would not suffer so much goodness to be violated  and sent me  who passing by accident near the place  was alarmed with her cries  to her succour —What were the emotions of my soul  when I beheld Narcissa  almost sinking beneath the brutal force of this satyr  I flew like lightening to her rescue  which he perceiving  quitted his prey  and drew his hanger to chastise my presumption —My indignation was too high to admit one thought of fear  so that rushing upon him  I struck his weapon out of his hand  and used my cudgel so successfully  that he fell to the ground  and lay  to all appearance  without sense —Then I turned to Narcissa  who had swooned  and sitting down by her  gently raised her head  and supported it on my bosom  while with my hand around her waist  I kept her in that position  My soul was thrilled with tumultuous joy  at feeling the object of my dearest wishes within my arms  and while she lay insensible  I could not refrain from applying my cheek to her s  and ravishing a kiss  In a little time  the blood began to revisit her face  she opened her enchanting eyes  and having recollected her late situation  said  with a look full of tender acknowledgment     Dear John  I am eternally obliged to you    So saying  she made an effort to rise  in which I assisted her  and she proceeded to the house  leaning upon me all the way  I was a thousand times tempted by this opportunity to declare my passion  but the dread of disobliging her  restrained my tongue  We had not got an hundred paces from
