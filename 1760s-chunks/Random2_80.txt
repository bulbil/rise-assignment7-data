 and for some time did not know what reply to make  when he asked my opinion of her beauty  At length I came to a determination  and told him that her name was Melinda  that she had a fortune of ten thousand pounds  and was said to be under promise of marriage to a certain lord  who deferred his nuptials  until he should be of age  which would happen in a few months —I thought this piece of intelligence  which I had myself invented  would have hindered him effectually from entertaining any further thoughts of her  but I was egregiously mistaken  The fox hunter had too much self sufficiency to despair of success with any competitor on earth  He therefore made light of her engagement  saying  with a smile of self approbation    Mayhap she will change her mind—what signifies his being a   237 Lord —I think myself as good a man as e er a Lord in christendom  and I ll see if a commoner worth three thousand a year won t serve her turn  —  This determination startled me not a little  I knew he would soon discover the contrary of what I advanced  and as I believed he would find her ear open to his addresses  did not doubt of meeting with every obstacle in my amour  that her malice could invent  and her influence with him execute —This reflection increased my chagrin—My vexation was evident—Narcissa insisted on going home immediately  and as I led her to the door  her noble admirer  with a look full of languishment  ditected to her a profound bow  which stung me to the soul —Before she went into the chair  she asked  with an appearance of concern  what was the matter with me  and I could pronounce no more than    By heaven  I m distracted        238  CHAP  LVIII    Tortured with jealousy  I go home and abuse Strap—receive a message from Narcissa  in consequence of which  I hasten to her apartment  where her endearing assurances banish all my doubts and apprehensions—in my retreat I discover somebody in the dark  whom  suspecting to be a spy  I resolve to kill  but  to my great surprize  am convinced of his being no other than Strap—Melinda slanders me—I become acquainted with Lord Quiverwit  who endeavours to sound me  with regard to Narcissa—the Squire is introduced to his lordship  and grows cold towards me—I learn from my confidante  that this nobleman professes honourable love to my mistress  who continues faithful to me  notwithstanding the scandalous reports she has heard to my prejudice—I am mortified with an assurance that her whole fortune depends upon the pleasure of her brother—Mr  Freeman condoles me on the decline of my character  which I vindicate so much to his satisfaction  that he undertakes to combat same in my behalf   HAVING uttered this exclamation  at which she sighed  I went home in the condition   239 of a frantic Bedlamite  and finding the fire in my apartment almost extinguished  vented my fury upon poor Strap  whose ear I pinched with such violence  that he roared hideously with pain  and when I quitted my hold looked so foolishly aghast  that no unconcerned spectator could have seen him  without been seized with an immoderate fit of laughter —It it true  I was soon sensible of the injury I had done  and asked pardon for the outrage I had committed  upon which my faithful valet  shaking his head  said     I forgive you  and may God forgive you  —  But he could not help shedding some tears at my unkindness  I felt unspeakable remorse for what I had done  cursed my own ingratitude  and considered his tears as a reproach that my soul  in her present disturbance  could not bear —It set all my passions into a new ferment  I swore horrible oaths without meaning or application  I foamed at the mouth  kicked the chairs about the room  and play d abundance of mad pranks that frightened my friend almost out of his senses —At length my transport subsided  I became melancholy  and wept insensibly     During this state of dejection  I was surprized with the appearance of Miss Williams  whom Strap  blubbering all the while  had conducted into the chamber without giving me previous notice of her approach —She was extremely affected with my condition  which she had learned from him  begged me to moderate my passion  suspend my conjectures  and follow her to Narcissa  who desired to see me forthwith —That dear name operated upon me like a charm  I started up  and without opening my lips  was conducted into her apartment through the garden  which   240 we entered by a private door —I found the adorable creature in tears  I was melted at the fight—we continued silent for some time—my heart was too full to speak—her snowy bosom heaved with fond resentment  at last she sobbing cried     What have I done to disoblige you  —  My heart was pierced with the tender question  I drew near with the utmost reverence of affection  I fell upon my knees before her  and kissing her hand  exclaimed    O  thou art all goodness and perfection  I am undone by
