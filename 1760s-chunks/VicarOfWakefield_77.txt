my sincerity    Mr  Wilmot now entering  he seemed not a little pleased at the danger his daughter had just escaped  and readily consented to a dissolution of the match  But finding that her fortune  which was secured to Mr  Thornhill by bond  would not be given up  nothing could exceed his disappointment  He now saw that his money must all go to enrich one who had no fortune of his own  He could bear his being a rascal  but to want an equivalent to his daughter s fortune was wormwood  He sate therefore for some minutes employed in the most mortifying speculations  till Sir William attempted to  Page  202  lessen his anxiety —     I must confess  Sir    cried he    that your present disappointment does not entirely displease me  Your immoderate passion for wealth is now justly punished  But tho  the young lady cannot be rich  she has still a competence sufficient to give content  Here you see an honest young soldier  who is willing to take her without fortune  they have long loved each other  and for the friendship I bear his father  my interest shall not be wanting for his promotion  Leave then that ambition which disappoints you  and for once admit haphappiness which courts your acceptance     Sir William    replied the old gentleman    be assured I never yet forced her inclinations  nor will I now  If she still continues to love this young gentleman  let her have him with all my heart  There is still  thank heaven  some fortune left  and your promise will make it  Page  203  something more  Only let my old friend here  meaning me  give me a promise of settling six thousand pounds upon my girl  if ever he should come to his fortune  and I am ready this night to be the first to join them together    As it now remained with me to make the young couple happy  I readily gave a promise of making the settlement he required  which  to one who had such little expectations as I  was no great favour  We had now therefore the satisfaction of seeing them fly into each other s arms in a transport      After all my misfortunes    cried my son George    to be thus rewarded  Sure this is more than I could ever have presumed to hope for  To be possessed of all that s good  and after such an interval of pain  My warmest wishes could never rise so high    —   Yes  my George    returned his  Page  204  lovely bride    now let the wretch take my fortune  since you are happy without it so am I  O what an exchange have I made from the basest of men to the dearest best —Let him enjoy our fortune  I now can be happy even in indigence    —   And I promise you    cried the  Squire  with a malicious grin    that I shall be very happy with what you despise    —   Hold  hold  Sir    cried Jenkinson    there are two words to that bargain  As for that lady s fortune  Sir  you shall never touch a single stiver of it  Pray your honour    continued he to Sir William    can the  Squire have this lady s fortune if he be married to another    —   How can you make such a simple demand    replied the Baronet    undoubtedly he cannot    —   I am sorry for that    cried Jenkinson    for as this gentleman and I have been old fellow sporters  I have a friendship for him  But I must declare  well as I love him  that his contract is not worth a tobacco  Page  205  stopper  for he is married already    —   You lie  like a rascal    returned the  Squire  who seemed rouzed by this insult    I never was legally married to any woman    —   Indeed  begging your honour s pardon    replied the other    you were  and I hope you will shew a proper return of friendship to your own honest Jenkinson  who brings you a wife  and if the company restrains their curiosity a few minutes  they shall see her    —So saying he went off with his usual celerity  and left us all unable to form any probable conjecture as to his design —   Ay let him go    cried the  Squire    whatever else I may have done I defy him there  I am too old now to be frightened with squibs     I am surprised    said the Baronet    what the fellow can intend by this  Some low piece of humour I suppose    —   Perhaps  Sir    replied I    he may have  Page  206  a more serious meaning  For
