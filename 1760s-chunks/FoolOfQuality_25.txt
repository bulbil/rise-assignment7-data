up in admiration  even though   it be exaggerated  to a being nobler than oneself  Alas  for   the man who has not felt that only through respect for others   can true self respect be gained  that he who worships nothing    will never be worshipful himself  Reverent  confiding loyalty         xlii PREFACE      has been as yet the parent of all true freedom  and will be so   to the end of time  to judge from the success of the Transatlantic   attempt at liberty without loyalty  It is easy to boast of freedom   and independence  but there are those who would question  as   Henry Brooke would have done  whether there was not as much   manly independence in the heart of the Englishman who kneels   and trembles  he knows not why  before a certain lady in   St  James s Palace  as in the heart of the Yankee lad who boasts   that he is   as good as the President   So  at least  thought Henry   Brooke  He had an intense capacity for worship  All his life he   delighted to look up to beings better than himself  and  through   them  to God  as the sum and substance of all their goodness   and   not in spite of that  but because of that  he was  in the very best   sense of the word  a Liberal  Against all tyranny  cruelty  and   wrong   against the chicaneries of the law and the chicaneries of   politicians  his voice was always loud and earnest  He held   political opinions which are now held or  at least  acted on by   every rational Englishman  whether Whig or Tory  but which   were then considered dangerous  destructive  immoral   and he   Buffered for his opinions  in fame and in pocket  and held them still    Never man lived a more original  self determined  independent   life   but he knew how to give honour where honour was due      In London he studied law  and enjoyed such society as Pope    Lyttleton  and Swift could give him  But these studies  however    and this society were quaintly enough interrupted  He was re    called to Ireland by a dying aunt  to become guardian of her child    a beautiful little girl of twelveCatherine Meares of Meares Court    of a good old Westmeath house  He put her  wisely enough  to a   boarding school in Dublin   and within two years  not quite so   wisely  married her secretly  Yet  neither the heavens nor his   family seem to have been very wroth with the folly  The marriage   was as happy a one as this earth ever saw  the parents Irish   people not holding the tenets of Malthus could not find it in their   hearts to scold so pretty a pair of turtles  and simply re married   them  and left them to reap the awful fruits of their own folly in   the form of a child per year  On which matter  doubtless  much   unwisdom has been  and will be  talked in commonplaces which   every one can supply for himself  But it is worth while to clear   one s mind of cant  if it be only to judge Henry Brooke fairly for   five minutes  and to disentangle from each other some of the many   unsound objections which  as usual  are supposed to make one sound   one  It is wrong to marry secretly  True  But which is worse    to marry secretly  or to be vicious secretly  with the vast majority   of young men  If Brooke is to be judged for doing what his   parents disapproved  then he is less  and not more guilty  than               PREFACE  iliii     three young men out of four unless parents would really prefer   ten years of vice for their sons  to the evils of an early mar    riage  And the truth is  that parents the average religious   parents  as well as others do prefer the vice to the marriage     silence their consciences mean while  with an hypocrisy as sad as   ludicrous  by asking no questions  lest they should discover what   they perfectly well know of already   and so lose  for the ten most   important years of the youth s life  all moral influence  all mutual   confidence  if not all mutual respect       But early marriages are so imprudent   Which would have   been most imprudent for Henry Brooke To run the chance  as   three out of four run  of destroying both body and soul in hell  and   bringing to a late marriage the
