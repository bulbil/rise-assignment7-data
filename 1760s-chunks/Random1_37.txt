    Anan    Upon which I came up in order to explain the question  but had the misfortune to be unintelligible likewise  the carman damning us for a lousy Scotch guard  and whipping up his horses with a   Gee ho    which nettled me to the quick  and roused the indignation of Strap so far  that after the fellow was gone a good way  he told me he would fight him for a farthing —While we were deliberating what was next to be done  an hackney coachman driving softly along  and perceiving   98 us standing by the kennel  came up close to us  and calling    A coach  master    by a dexterous management of the reins  made his horses stumble in the wet  and bedaub us all over with mud —After which  he drove on  applauding himself with a hearty laugh  in which several people joined  to my great mortification  but one more compassionate than the rest seeing us strangers  advised me to go into an ale house  and dry myself  I thanked him for his advice  which I immediately complied with  and going into the house he pointed out  called for a pot of beer  and sat down by the fire in a public room  where we cleaned ourselves as well as we could—In the mean time  a wag who sat in a box  smoaking his pipe  understanding by our dialect who we were  came up to me  and  with a very grave countenance  asked me  how long I had been caught  As I did not know the meaning of his question  I made no answer  and he went on  saying  it could not be a great while  for my tail was not yet cut  at the same time taking hold of my hair  and tipping the wink to the rest of the company  which seemed highly entertained with his wit —I was incensed at this usage  but afraid of resenting it  because I happened to be in a strange place  and perceived the person who spoke to me  was a brawny fellow  for whom I was by no means a match  However  Strap having either more courage or less caution  could not put up with the insults that I suffered  but told him with a peremptory tone    He was an uncivil fellow  for making so free with his betters  —  Whereupon  the wit going toward him  asked    What he had got in his knapsack    Is it oat meal or brimstone  Sawney    99  said he  seizing him by the chin  which he shook to the inexpressible diversion of all present —My companion feeling himself assaulted in such an opprobrious manner  disengaged himself in a trice  and lent his antagonist such a box on the ear  as made him stagger to the other side of the room  and in a moment  a ring was formed for the combatants —Seeing Strap beginning to strip  and my blood being heated with indignation  which banished all other thoughts  I undressed myself to the skin in an instant  and declared  that as the affront that occasioned the quarrel was offered to me  I would fight it out myself  upon which one or two cried out    That s a brave Scotch boy  you shall have fair play  by G—d    This gave me fresh spirits  and going up to my adversary  who by his pale countenance  did not seem much inclined to the battle  I struck him so hard on the stomach that he reeled over a bench  and fell to the ground  Here I attempted to get a top of him in order to improve my success  according to the manner of my own country  but was restrained by the spectators  one of whom endeavoured to raise up my opponent  but in vain  for he protested he would not fight  not being quite recovered of a late illness —I was very well pleased with this excuse  and immediately dressed myself  having acquired the good opinion of the company for my bravery  as did also my comrade Strap  who shook me by the hand and wished me joy of the victory —After having drank our pot  and dried our cloaths  we enquired of the landlord if he knew Mr  Cringer the member of parliament  and were amazed at his replying in the negative  for we imagined  he must be   100 every bit as conspicuous here  as in the borough he represented  but he told us we might possibly hear of him as we passed along —Whereupon we betook ourselves to the street  where  seeing a footman standing at a door  we made up to him  and asked if he knew where our patron lived —This member of the party coloured sraternity  surveying us both very minutely  said he knew Mr  Cringer very well  and bid us turn down the first street on our left  then turn to the right  and then to the left again  after which we would observe a lane  through which we must pass  and at the other end we should find an alley that leads to another street  where we should see the sign of the
