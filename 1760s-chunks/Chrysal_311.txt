Lord of the Admir    alty   but Pitt was now in power  The old administration was scared   to death by the popular clamour  and the King was averse from remitting   the death penalty  which was duly carried out  in spite of the opposition   of Pitt  Temple  and other sensible men          ADVENTURES OP A GUINEA 367     hisi  And  even after he was condemned  his behaviour proved that he   expected a pardon to the last moment  for a crime which he had   committed in obedience to their orders  Why he did not produce   those orders in his vindication must have been that they were only   verbal ones   which  in the blind lust of ministerial confidence   and favour  he had been weak enough to take  The reason of his   being so basely deserted is too obvious  The administration of   those who had employed him had been such a series of blunders   â€” not to call it by a severer name   â€” that they had not only been sup    planted by another set 2  who promised better things  but were also   obliged to give him up as a sin offering to the rage of the people     as protecting or pardoning him would have implied a participation   of his guilt  And in this light the other party viewed it so strongly    that they exerted all their strength to have saved him  in hopes of   being able by his means to gain a clue to guide them through some   of those labyrinths of iniquitous and false policy  which they sus    pected  but could not otherwise detect  to the entire overthrow of   their rivals  This so absolutely reversed the whole scene  that   they who should have supported  now found themselves obliged   to crush him  in their own defence   which  as it was the most   popular measure  they were still able to do        There is but one thing more necessary for me to add  and that   is  the motive for their giving him such secret orders   which  as   far as reason can judge in such dark confused mysteries  must have   been this   Provoked at the repeated insults and injustice of the   IVench  the ministry here had precipitately plunged themselves   into war    without being prepared  or even determined to pursue   it   and then  like a parcel of children who have exhausted all their   strength and resolution in one spiteful assault  stood in a state of   stupefaction  utterly at a loss how to proceed  or retreat   till  roused   at length by the preparations and menaces of the enemy  they   unluckily blundered in their fright upon the wretched expedient   of letting them take this fortress  that  for the recovery of it  they   might have a pretence for giving up to them those places about   which the dispute began   and so botch up a peace anyway  to get   rid of a war they found themselves unable to manage  The conse    quence of this notable stroke of policy was  the spirit of the people   was inflamed to such a degree  by this disgrace upon their arms    that they pushed on the war with a resolution little short of mad    ness   and the scheme  which the ministers had so wisely laid for   their escape  only sealed their ruin        This  my friend  is a short but just sketch of this unfortunate   affair  to which I shall add one circumstance to prove what I said   of his being sacrificed to the humour of the times  The officer who       Alluding to the case of Admiral Lestock  who  in the battle of Toulon    1744  failed to bring his part of the fleet into action  in spite of Admiral   Mathews  repeated signals  A court martial was held  but Lestock   was acquitted on a technical point      2 Pitt s ministry  which came into power in December 1756       Alludes to the large captures of French shipping made by the British   before the declaration of war in 1757          368   â  â   ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     commanded in the fortress   which was besieged  and who in the   defence of it had betrayed a want of every qualification necessary   for such an office  but courage   and had even let that be overruled   by the instances of his officers  who were tired of fatigues and   dangers from which they saw no prospect of relief  to surrender   it at last   without any absolute necessity  was loaded with honours    of every kind
