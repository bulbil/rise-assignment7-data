however seriously  and happily related  she could not fail of being shocked at the thoughts of so precipate a journey  without the privacy of any of her friends  But so great was her attachment grown  that she could not reflect upon her being the imaginary cause of her lover s losing so fair a prospect of being in his uncle s will without the utmost repugnance  and to be made a woman and a wife the next morning  was what she so much approved  that her inclination surmounted her reason  and she agreed to set out between two and three for London     143With all imaginable privacy  they got into a post chaise  which set out at the time appointed  and her maid and his servant followed them about an hour after with the baggage belonging to the young officer and his mistress   Agreeable to his promise  he made a bride of her at the first town they came to  and they then continued their journey without the least precipitancy   As soon as the trustee was acquainted with the flight of the lady  he made inquired all over the town  in order to be informed what rout the fugitives had taken  imagining  however  that it might be a frolic  as he expected that day to receive  by the return of the post  advice from his correspondent of the payment of the bill  but when he was informed that two post chaises set out that morning for London  and that his ward was actually gone in one of them  in company with her lover  he was greatly staggered in his opinion  The receipt of the letters from Bristol soon fixed it  and determined him to set out immediately in pursuit of the lady     144He overtook the lovers at an inn on the road  and after saluting them  desired to know whether they were going  The officer answered  to London  This  the other said  he might do  but his ward must return with him  for that our hero was an impostor  showing the letter he had received from Bristol   The lady seemed greatly surprised at this  while her husband insisted that some body had answered that letter in his name  on purpose to prejudice him in the lady s favour  The guardian replied  that such subterfuges were too glaring to impose on him  and that the lady should not step one inch farther with him   The chaise being ready at the inn door at this time  they came out  and he addressed his wife in these terms    Madam  do you chuse to go with me  who am your lawful husband  or with that old gentleman   At this interrogation she stretched out her hand  he helped her in  and left her guardian and the rest of the spectators  in the greatest consternation       145They immediately repaired to London  and by means of publishing his marriage with an heiress  as she really was  of eight thousand pounds fortune  he got as much credit as he wanted  though he was obliged to give 20 per cent  interest for ready money  By this means they lived in an elegant and luxurious manner  and to all appearance no couple were so happy as capt  R—ss and his wife   The time of her being at age came which was sixteen months after the marriage was celebrated  and the husband wrote to her trustee for all her papers  which he refused at first to deliver  but at length finding capt  R—ss was resolute  he complied  and our hero was put in possession of all her fortune   But after the debts lie had contracted since his marriage were paid  and also the ready money borrowed  with interest  was returned to those who had lent it  he had but three thousand pounds left  which  he sound by experience  would last but a short time  at the rate they then lived in keeping house  Upon this he told his wife   146 the necessity there was of retiring into the country  and living frugally  She consented to it  and accordingly set out for Yorkshire  where he boarded her at a farmhouse for twenty pounds a year   With the remainder of his wife s fortune he returned to London  and gamed  whored  drank  and committed every species of extravagance  till it was pretty near exhausted  He then thought it time to recruit  and recollecting that a dis•••• relation of his  an old methodist woman  lived in Yorkshire  said to be 〈◊〉 twelve hundred pounds  he immediately set out for the place  but  finding she conversed with none but those of her own sect  he was under an obligation of becoming a convert to get access to her  and no body pronounced    We are all irretrievably damned  better than himself  In a word he was a staunch methodist     So young and handsome a proselyte was the admiration of all the congregation  particularly the female part  and being taken notice of by the old lady for his sanctity  he found means to gain access by presenting her with a new edition of   147 Mr  Wesley s sermons  which was so acceptable to her  that she thought that
