and mortifying style  and though I was at that time  pretty far advanced in a work for his benefit  which was a sufficient  security for what I owed him  he roundly asked  how I proposed to pay  the money which I had already borrowed  Thus was I used like a young w    just come upon the town  whom the b  d allows to run into her debt   that she may have it in her power to oppress her at pleasure  and if the  sufferer complains  she is treated like the most ungrateful wretch  upon earth  and that too with such appearance of reason  as may easily  mislead an unconcerned spectator   You unthankful drab   she will say    didn t I take you into my house when you hadn t a shift to your back   a petticoat to your tail  nor a morsel of bread to put into your belly   Han t I clothed you from head to foot like a gentlewoman  supported you  with board  lodging  and all necessaries  till your own extravagance  hath brought you into distress  and now you have the impudence  you  nasty  stinking  brimstone bungaway  to say you are hardly dealt with   when I demand no more than my own   Thus the w   and the author are  equally oppressed  and even left without the melancholy privilege of  complaining  so that they are fain to subscribe to such terms as their  creditors shall please to impose    This illustration operated so powerfully upon the conviction and  resentment of the whole college  that revenge was universally denounced  against those who had aggrieved the plaintiff  and  after some debate   it was agreed  that he should make a new translation of some other  saleable book  in opposition to a former version belonging to the  delinquents  and print it in such a small size as would enable him  to undersell their property  and that this new translation should  be recommended and introduced into the world with the whole art and  influence of the society   This affair being settled to the satisfaction of all present  an author  of some character stood up  and craved the advice and assistance of his  fellows  in punishing a certain nobleman of great pretensions to taste   who  in consequence of a production which this gentleman had ushered  into the world with universal applause  not only desired  but even  eagerly courted his acquaintance   He invited me to his house   said he    where I was overwhelmed with civility and professions of friendship   He insisted upon my treating him as an intimate  and calling upon him at  all hours  without ceremony  he made me promise to breakfast with him  at least three times a week  In short  I looked upon myself as very  fortunate  in meeting with such advances from a man of his interest and  reputation  who had it in his power to befriend me effectually in my  passage through life  and  that I might not give him any cause to think  I neglected his friendship  I went to his house in two days  with a view  of drinking chocolate  according to appointment  but he had been so  much fatigued with dancing at an assembly overnight  that his  valet de chambre would not venture to wake him so early  and I left my  compliments to his lordship  with a performance in manuscript  which he  had expressed a most eager desire to peruse  I repeated my visit next  morning  that his impatience to see me might not have some violent    6 22 15  3 45 PM   effect upon his constitution  and received a message from his minister   signifying  that he had been highly entertained with the manuscript I  had left  a great part of which he had read  but was at present so busy  in contriving a proper dress for a private masquerade  which would  be given that same evening  that he could not have the pleasure of my  company at breakfast  This was a feasible excuse  which I admitted  accordingly  and in a day or two appeared again  when his lordship was  particularly engaged  This might possibly be the case  and therefore I  returned the fourth time  in hopes of finding him more at leisure   but he had gone out about half an hour before my arrival  and left my  performance with his valet de chambre  who assured me  that his lord  had perused it with infinite pleasure  Perhaps I might have retired very  well satisfied with this declaration  had not I  in my passage through  the hall  heard one of the footmen upon the top of the staircase   pronounce with an audible voice   Will your lordship please to be at  home when he calls   It is not to be supposed that I was pleased at this  discovery  which I no sooner made  than  turning to my conductor   I  find   said I   his lordship is disposed to be abroad to more people
