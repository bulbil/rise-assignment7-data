Where ever the fault lay  it lay not with the Chevalier  He has  from the first to the last  acted with the nicest honour  He is intitled to our respect  The unhappiness lies no where but in the difference of religion   Well  and that now is absolutely out of the question  said the General  It is indeed  Chevalier   I hope  my Lord  from a descendant of a family so illustrious  to find an equal exemption from wounding words  and wounding looks  and that  Sir  as well from your generosity  as from your justice   My looks give you offence  Chevalier —Do they   I attended to the Marchioness  She came towards me  I arose  and respectfully took her hand —Chevalier  said she  I could not withdraw without bearing the testimony I have borne to your merits  I wish you happy—God protect you  whithersoever you go  Adieu   She wept  I bowed on her hand with profound respect  She retired with precipitation  It was with difficulty that I suppressed the rising tear  I took my seat   I made no answer to the General s last question  tho  it was spoken in such a way  I saw by their eyes  as took every other person s notice   Lady Sforza  when her sister was retired  hinted  that the last interview between the young Lady and me was an unadvised permission  tho  intended for the best     337 I then took upon me to defend that step  Lady Clementina  said I  had declared  That if she were allowed to speak her whole mind to me  she should be easy  I had for some time given myself up to absolute despair  The Marchioness intended not favour to me in allowing of the interview  It was the most affecting one to me I had ever known  But let me say  That  far from having bad effects on the young Lady s mind  it had good ones  I hardly knew how to talk upon a subject so very interesting to every one present  but not more so to any one than to myself  I thought of avoiding it  and have been led into it  but did not lead  And since it is before us  let me recommend  as the most effectual way to restore every one to peace and happiness  gentle treatment  The most generous of human minds  the most meek  the most dutiful  requires not harsh methods —  How do you know  Sir  said the General  and looked at Jeronymo  the methods now taken—  And are they then harsh  my Lord  said I   He was offended   I had heard  proceeded I  that a change of measures was resolved on  I knew thatthe treatment before had been all gentle  condescending  indulgent  I received but yesterday Letters from my father  signifying his intention of speedily recalling me to my native country  I shall set out very soon for Paris  where I hope to meet with his more direct commands for this long desired end  What may be my destiny  I know not  but I shall carry with me a heart burdened with the woes of this family  and distressed for the beloved daughter of it  But let me bespeak you all  for your own sakes  Mine is out of the question  I presume not upon any hope on my own account  that you will treat this Angelic minded Lady with tenderness  I pretend to say  that I know that harsh or severe methods will not do   The General arose from his seat  and  with a countenance   338 of fervor  next to fierceness—Let me tell you  Grandison  said he—  I arose from mine  and going to Lady Sforza who sat next him  he stopt  supposing me going to him  and seemed surprised  and attentive to my motions  But  disregarding him  I addressed myself to that Lady  You  madam  are the aunt of Lady Clementina  The tender  the indulgent mother is absent  and has declared  that she resigns her will to the will of her friends present—Allow me to supplicate  that former measures may not be changed with her  Great dawnings of returning reason did I discover in our last interview  Her delicacy  Never was there a more delicate mind  wanted but to be satisfied  It was satisfied  and she began to be easy  Were her mind but once composed  the sense she has of her duty  and what she owes to her religion  would restore her to your wishes  But if she should be treated harshly  tho  I am sure  if she should  it would be with the best intention  Clementina will be lost   The General sat down  They all looked upon one another  The two Ladies dried their eyes  The starting tear would accompany my fervor  And then stepping to Jeronymo  who was extremely affected  My dear Jeronymo  said I  my friend  my beloved friend  cherish in your noble heart the memory of your Grandison  Would to God I could attend you to England  We have baths there of sovereign efficacy  The
