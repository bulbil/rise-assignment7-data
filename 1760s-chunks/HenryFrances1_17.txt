I kissed your last Billet  as it was  in some sort  an Emblem of yourself  short and sweet   I sincerely wish there was such a Sympathy between us  as you hint at  of mutual Affections and Passions  but all the Effect  I feel  is like what is perceivable in Iron  touched by the Loadstone  I am sensible of an Attraction  but alas  my Needle points still to the North  which is the Region of your Chastity   I will make my Letter as short as your s  to shew you  I can keep to a Pattern  tho  I have not been able to put as good Stuff in the Suit   Adieu   Henry     42  LETTER XXX   Dear HARRY   Ripton   BECAUSE a Surprize is an agreeable Novelty in this same repetitious World  I would not give you the least Hint of our intended Frolick  Kitty and I set out on Tuesday Morning for this Place  which we reached much fatigued that Night  partly by Stage  and partly Horses  which her Brother brought to meet us at —  which Town was all in Flames  as we passed thro  it  but our Virtue carried us safe thro  the Fire Ordeal   Direct for me at —  for we shall be all next Week at the Assizes  which are expected to be very gay  I have often thought this a very odd Time for Diversion  and that a Jury shall now pass a Verdict of Death  and then go dance  There is also a Sort of Cruelty in it to the miserable Wretches  who suffer Death or Banishment at such Times  for the Weight of all Ills is increased by comparing ourselves with those  who seem to rejoice in Health or Happiness   We shall return to London in ten Days   Adieu     43  LETTER XXXI  HENRY to FRANCES   I HAVE delayed answering your Letter   till the Post is just going out  that I might have as little Time to spare for that Purpose as possible  lest I should answer it too fully and circumstantially  therefore shall only say  that  if you will recollect yourself  you will find  that  since the First of our Acquaintance  there has not been an Act of Dishonour  Unkindness  or even the lowest Baseness to be imagined  which you have not  at several Times  charged me with  my Love  my Friendship  my Honour  my Word  my Oath  all suspected  And the highest and often repeated Testimonies of them all discredited    Are these Things so   and are you surprized  I should warmly expostulate about them  Which was in Truth all I did in that Letter  that has moved you to such intemperate Resentment   When I press you home  about some Particulars in your former Letters  you pretend to be in Jest —Is this ingenuous Dealing —When I invite a large Set of Company to pass the Summer at Belvidere  merely to save Appearances in your coming  you tell me you understand this  but as a Pique of Honour  But indeed  Fanny  if I had not more true Love for   44 you  than I find I have Credit for  the Caprice and Unreasonableness of your Behaviour  in several Instances of our Lives  would have left me no Necessity for preserving such a Pique   I shall say no more  till we meet  nor then  I hope  one Word upon this Subject  for I believe Half an Hour s Reflection  upon the Substance of this Letter  will prevent all Occasion of such Altercation for the future   I am   my dearest Fanny   notwithstanding the Mortifications I have met with   Your s indeed  Henry   LETTER XXXII  FRANCES to HENRY   What is the Reason that you use me thus   But  tis no Matter—  Let Hercules himself do what he may   The Cat will mew  and Dog will have his Day   IT is a provoking Thing  that I have not any Person to whom I dare appeal  upon a Difference  or Dispute between us  Yet it would avail me nothing  if I had  for that provoking  insincere  plausible  philosophick Temper   45 of yours  would prejudice any Judge in your Favour  In short  the Reasonableness of my Resentment cannot always appear  but the Calmness of your Anger may  for  while I am raging like one bit by a mad Dog  you are looking as demure and wise as a Physician feeling a Pulse  Thus superficial Observers are imposed upon  but the Searcher of Hearts would find mine all the Time overflowing with Tenderness and Good nature  your s rendered callous by deliberate Malice  and calm Rancour   I know you will be angry at this  but so you have pleased to be with  almost  every second Letter I ever wrote to you  and every second or third Conversation has been a Quarrel   I find we are both apt Scholars at a Game they call Snap Dragon  but it shall not be my Fault  if we do not leave off  before we have burnt our Fingers
