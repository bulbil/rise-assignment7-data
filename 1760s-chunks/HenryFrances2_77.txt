YOU know I was lately angry  And I am so ashamed of it  that I have been recollecting what my Reading  or own Reflections can suggest  first  to palliate the Offence for what is past  and to prevent  for the future  the ill Effects of a Vice and Weakness  which I think even I have Sense and Virtue enough to guard myself from   The best Hints  which I shall offer here  are taken from an Essay upon this very Subject of Anger  wrote by Lord Verulam   To extinguish this Passion entirely  is but a Bravery of the Stoics  For  like all ill Habits  we must cure ourselves by Degrees  as a skilful Rider manages an headstrong Horse  guides his Steps in the safest Course  and pulls and relaxes the Rein by Turns  The Reason that so few People reclaim themselves from bad Affections  is owing more to Want of Judgment  than Virtue  We grow careless  upon finding the Page  292 Imperfections of human Nature not easily conquered by the Perfection of Philosophy  not being aware that Habit must be overcome by Habit  as Regimen cures chronical Distempers better than Medicines  Intermissions are as necessary in Ethics  as in Physic  The Scriptures  which are better Guides in Morals  than the whole Body of Philosophers  give some Indulgence to human Frailty in this Particular   Be ye angry  but sin not   And in another Place    Let not the Sun go down upon your Wrath   which seems to declare  that the Continuance of Anger  not the first Start of it  makes the Vice  Bacon says  the best Way to cure the natural Inclination or Habit of Resentment  is to reflect upon the Effects of Anger   how it troubles a Man s Life   and the best Time to do this is to look back upon Anger  when the Fit is over  Seneca says well  that  Anger is like a Ruin  which breaks itself upon that it falls   Socrates being asked what a Man was doing  who was seen in the Street chafing himself in a Rage  answered justly   he is punishing an angry Man   The Scripture exhorts us to possess our Souls in Patience  then whoever is out of Patience  is out of Possession of his Soul  A passionate Man may be compared to a Bee  according to Virgil s Expression  that  when they sting  they lose their Spirit in the Wound  Perhaps this may leave an Open Page  293 to Sarcasm  to compare a calm Man to a Drone  Bacon says  it ought to make Men ashamed of Anger  the Consideration of those Persons  who are most subject to it  Children  Women  old People  and sick Folks  Men should carry their Resentment rather with Scorn  than Passion  especially where our Pride is picqued  for that same Pride should rather shew us above  than below an Injury or Affront  Many other Arguments  drawn from Prudence  Morality  and Religion  occur to me at present  but  I am sure  there are none of them necessary to inform your Sense and Understanding  and all I mean by this Essay  is to furnish you with a few Hints to be offered to my own Consideration  whenever you find me relapsing into that Weakness  which you may remember in a former Letter  some Time ago  I mentioned as the only Thing  which  now and then  gets the better of the Tenor of my Philosophy     Adieu  my fairest Guide  I assure you  that I fly to your Arms with all the Impatience of an angry Man  and with all that Good nature and Affection  which passionate Persons are remarkable for   Athenodorus   Page  294  LETTER CCCII   Dear FANNY   I ARRIVED here last Night  much fatigued by the Warmth of the Weather  I hope my Pet is well  and my Pet s Pet  My Blessing to the little Fellow   I perceived my Heart growing warm at the Approach to a Place  where I had  twenty Years ago  spent so many chearful  boyish Days  Somewhat like the Emotion we feel upon meeting an old School fellow  whether it be one we have a particular Attachment to  or no  for I am not speaking here of a rational Affection  but such a Prejudice and Partiality  as is contracted from early Habit and Custom  before we have the free Exercise of our Understandings  The Love of our Country may be ranked under this Head  by which  I do not mean that Patriotism  which is but universal Benevolence  poorly bounded by a Province or Kingdom  but that superstitious Attachment  Men have even to the very Soil  they were born in  I fancy that departed Spirits  even in Bliss  look sometimes back upon this World with a Regard like this  though without any Desire of exchanging Situations  I speak this upon a Presumption that we carry our Consciousness with us to the Page  295 next World  which I look upon to be a Thing so far from requiring Proof  that to assert the contrary is arguing God to be partial or unjust  Should you be rendered a blessed Spirit
