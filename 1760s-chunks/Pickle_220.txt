that I overheard what he  said to his companions  and was so happy as to find myself the object  of his discourse  which abounded with rapturous expressions of love and  admiration  I could not listen to these transports without emotion  my  colour changed  my heart throbbed with unusual violence  and my eyes  betrayed my inclination in sundry favourable glances  which he seemed to  interpret aright  though he could not then avail himself of his success   so far as to communicate his sentiments by speech  because we were  strangers to each other    I passed that night in the most anxious suspense  and several days  elapsed before I saw him again  At length  however  being at court on  a ball night  and determined against dancing  I perceived him among the  crowd  and  to my unspeakable joy  saw him advance  with my Lord P     who introduced him to my acquaintance  He soon found means to alter my  resolution  and I condescended to be his partner all the evening  during  which he declared his passion in the most tender and persuasive terms  that real love could dictate  or fruitful imagination invent    I believed his protestations  because I wished them true  and was an  unexperienced girl of fifteen  I complied with his earnest request of  being permitted to visit me  and even invited him to breakfast next  morning  so that you may imagine  I speak to those that feel  I did  not  that night  enjoy much repose  Such was the hurry and flutter of my  spirits  that I rose at six to receive him at ten  I dressed myself in  a new pink satin gown  and my best laced night clothes  and was so  animated by the occasion that  if ever I deserved a compliment upon my  looks  it was my due at this meeting  The wished for moment came that  brought my lover to my view  I was overwhelmed with joy  modesty  and  fear of I knew not what  We sat down to breakfast  but did not eat  He  renewed his addresses with irresistible eloquence  and pressed me to  accept of his hand without further hesitation  But to such a precipitate  step I objected  as a measure repugnant to my decency  as well as to  that duty which I owed to my father  whom I tenderly loved    Though I withstood this premature proposal  I did not attempt to  disguise the situation of my thoughts  and thus commenced a tender  correspondence  which was maintained by letters while I remained in the  country  and carried on  when I was in town  by private interviews twice  or thrice a week at the house of my milliner  where such endearments  passed as refined and happy lovers know  and others can only guess   Truth and innocence prevailed on my side  while his heart was fraught  with sincerity and love  Such frequent intercourse created an intimacy  which I began to think dangerous  and therefore yielded to his repeated  desire that we might be united for ever  Nay  I resolved to avoid him   until the day should be fixed  and very innocently  though not very  wisely  told him my reason for this determination  which was no other  than a consciousness of my incapacity to refuse him anything he should  demand as a testimony of my love    The time was accordingly appointed  at the distance of a few days   during which I intended to have implored my father s consent  though I  had but faint hopes of obtaining it  But he was by some means or other    6 22 15  3 45 PM   apprised of our design  before I could prevail upon myself to make him  acquainted with our purpose  I had danced with my lover at the ridotto  on the preceding evening  and there perhaps our eyes betrayed us   Certain it is  several of Lord W   s relations  who disapproved of the  match  came up and rallied him on his passion  Lord S  k  in particular   used this remarkable expression   Nephew  as much love as you please   but no matrimony      Next day  the priest being prepared  and the bridegroom waiting for me  at the appointed place  in all the transports of impatient expectation   I was  without any previous warning  carried into the country by my  father  who took no notice of the intelligence he had received  but  decoyed me into the coach on pretence of taking the air  and  when we  had proceeded as far as Turnham Green  gave me to understand  that he  would dine in that place    There was no remedy  I was obliged to bear my disappointment  though  with an aching heart  and followed him up stairs into an apartment   where he told me he was minutely informed of my matrimonial scheme  I  did not attempt to disguise the truth  but assured him  while the tears  gushed from
