their wine  cries he  drinking off a glass  indeed  is most abominable   By this last contradiction the widow was fairly conquered in point of politeness  She perceived now that she had no pretensions in the world to taste  her very senses were vulgar  since she had praised detestable custard  and smacked at wretched wine  she was therefore content to yield the victory  and for the rest of the night to listen and improve  It is true  she would now and then forget herself  and confess she was pleased  but   29 they soon brought her back again to miserable refinement  She once praised the painting of the box in which we were sitting  but was soon convinced that such paltry pieces ought rather to excite horror than satisfaction  she ventured again to commend one of the singers  but Mrs  Tibbs soon let her know  in the style of a connoisseur  that the singer in question had neither ear  voice  nor judgment   Mr  Tibbs now willing to prove that his wife s pretensions to music were just  entreated her to favour the company with a song  but to this she gave a positive denial  for you know very well  my dear  says she  that I am not in voice to day  and when one s voice is not equal to one s judgment  what signifies singing  besides as there is no accompanyment  it would be but spoiling music  All these excuses however were overruled by the rest of the company  who  though one would think they already had music enough  joined in the intreaty  But particularly the widow  now willing to convince the company of her breeding  pressed so warmly that she seemed determined to take no refusal  At last then the lady complied  and after humming for some minutes  began with such a voice and such affectation  as I could perceive gave but little satisfaction to any except her husband  He sat with rapture in his eye  and beat time with his hand on the table   You must observe  my friend  that it is the custom of this country  when a lady or gentleman happens to sing  for the company to sit as mute and motionless as statues  Every feature  every limb must seem to correspond in fixed attention    30 and while the song continues  they are to remain in a state of universal petrefaction  In this mortifying situation we had continued for some time  listening to the song  and looking with tranquility  when the master of the box came to inform us  that the water works were going to begin  At this information I could instantly perceive the widow bounce from her seat  but correcting herself  she sat down again  repressed by motives of good breeding  Mrs  Tibbs  who had seen the water works an hundred times  resolving not to be interrupted  continued her song without any share of mercy  nor had the smallest pity on our impatience  The widow s face  I own  gave me high entertainment  in it I could plainly t••d the struggle she felt between good breeding and curiosity  she talked of the water works the whole evening before  and seemed to have come merely in order to see them  but then she could not bounce out in the very middle of a song  for that would be forfeiting all pretensions to high life  or high lived company ever after  Mrs  Tibbs therefore kept on singing  and we continued to listen  till at last  when the song was just concluded  the waiter came to inform us that the water works were over   The water works over  cried the widow  the water works over already  that s impossible  they can t be over so soon  It is not my business  replied the fellow  to contradict your ladyship  I ll run again and see  he went  and soon returned with a confirmation of the dismal tidings  No ceremony could now bind my friend s disappointed mistress  she testified her displeasure in the openest manner  in short  she now began to find   31 fault in turn  and at last  insisted upon going home  just at the time that Mr  and Mrs  Tibbs assured the company  that the polite hours were going to begin  and that the ladies would instantaneously be entertained with the horns  Adieu   LETTER LXIX  From the same   NOT far from this city lives a poor tinker  who has educated seven sons  all at this very time in arms and fighting for their country  and what reward do you think has the tinker from the state for such important services  None in the world  his sons  when the war is over  may probably be whipt from parish to parish as vagabonds  and the old man  when past labour  may die a prisoner in some house of correction   Such a worthy subject in China would be held in universal reverence  his services would be rewarded  if not with dignities  at least with an exemption from labour  he would take the left hand at feasts  and mandarines themselves would be proud to shew their submission  The English laws punish vice  the Chinese laws do more  they
