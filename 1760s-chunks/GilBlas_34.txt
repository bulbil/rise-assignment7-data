than my own life  I have no consideration but for your repose  and it is my purpose  after thus unburdening my heart  to finish in exile the sacrifice of an existence which has lost its value since no longer to be devoted to your service   No  Don Alvar  no  exclaimed I at these words  you shall never quit me a second time  I will be the companion of your wanderings  and death only shall divide us from this hour  Take my advice  replied he  live with Don Ambrosio  unite not yourself with my miseries  but leave me to stand under their undivided weight  These and other such entreaties he used  but the more willing he seemed to sacrifice himself to my welfare  the less did I feel disposed to take advantage of his generosity  When he saw me resolute in my determination to follow him  he all at once changed his tone  and assuming an aspect of more satisfaction  Madam  said he  since you still love Don Alvar well enough to prefer adversity with him before your present ease and affluence  let us then take up our abode at Betancos  in the interior of Galicia  There I have a safe retreat  Though my misfortunes may have stripped me of all my effects  they have not alienated all my friends  some are yet faithful  and have furnished me with the means of carrying you off  With their help I have hired a carriage at Zamora  have bought mules and horses  and am accompanied by perhaps the three boldest of the Galicians  They are armed with carabines and pistols  waiting my orders at the village of Rodillas  Let us avail ourselves of Don Ambrosio s absence  I will send the carriage to the castle gate  and we will set out without loss of time  I consented  Don Alvar flew towards Rodillas  and shortly returned with his escort  My women  from the midst of whom I was carried off  not knowing what to think of this violent proceeding  made their escape in great terror  In√®s only was in the secret  but she would not link her fate with mine  on account of a love affair with Don Ambrosio s favourite man   I got into the carriage  therefore  with Don Alvar  taking nothing with me but my clothes and some jewels of my own before my second marriage  for I could not think of appropriating any presents of the Marquis  We travelled in the direction of Galicia  without knowing if we should be lucky enough to reach it  We had reason to fear Don Ambrosio s pursuit on his return  and that we should be overtaken by superior numbers  We went forward for two days without any alarm  and in the hope of being equally fortunate the third  had got into a very quiet conversation  Don Alvar was relating the melancholy adventure which had occasioned the rumour of his death  and how he recovered his freedom  after five years of slavery  when yesterday we met upon the Leon road the banditti you were with  He it was whom they killed with all his attendants  and it is for him the tears flow  which you see me shedding at this moment       CH  XII     A disagreeable interruption   DONNA MENCIA melted into tears as she finished this recital  I allowed her to give a free passage to her sighs  I even wept myself for company  so natural is it to be interested for the afflicted  and especially for a lovely female in distress  I was just going to ask her what she meant to do in the present conjuncture  and possibly she was going to consult me on the same subject if our conversation had not been interrupted  but we heard a great noise in the inn  which drew our attention whether we would or no  It was no less than the arrival of the corregidor  attended by two alguazils and their marshalmen  They came into the room where we were  A young gentleman in their train came first up to me  and began taking to pieces the different articles of my dress  He had no occasion to examine them long  By Saint James  exclaimed he  this is my identical doublet  It is the very thing  and as safely to be challenged as my horse  You may commit this spark on my recognizance  he is one of the gang who have an undiscovered retreat in this country   At this discourse  which gave me to understand my accuser to be the gentleman robbed  whose spoils to my confusion were exclusively my own  I was without a word to say for myself  looking one way and the other  and not knowing where to fix my eyes  The corregidor  whose office was suspicion  set me down for the culprit  and  presuming on the lady for an accomplice  ordered us into separate custody  This magistrate was none of your stem gallows preaching fellows  he had a jocular epigrammatic sort of countenance  God knows if his heart lay in the right place for all that  As soon as I was committed  in came he with his pack  They knew their trade  and began by searching me  What a forfeit to these lords of the manor
