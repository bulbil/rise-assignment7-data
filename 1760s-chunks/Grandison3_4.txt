 And yet  to go down to such dear friends without it  what an ungrateful sound has that   Miss Grandison began to talk of other subjects relating to her brother  and those greatly to his praise  I could have heard all she had to say with infinite pleasure  I do love to hear him praised  But  as I doubted not but these subjects arose from the letter so surreptitiously obtained  I restrained myself  and withdrew   OF what an happy temper is Miss Grandison  She was much affected with the scene that passed between   9 us  but all is over with her already  One lesson upon her harpsichord sets every thing right with her  She has been raillying Lord L  with as much life and spirit  as if she had done nothing to be vexed at  Had I been induced by her to read the letter which she got at dishonestly  as she owned  what a poor figure should I have made in my own eyes  for a month to come   But did she not as soon overcome the mortification given her by her brother  on the detection of captain Anderson s affair  How unmercifully did she railly me  within a few hours after —Yet  she has fine qualities  One cannot help loving her  I do love her  But is it not a weakness to look without abatement of affection on those faults in one person  which we should hold utterly inexcusable in another  In Miss Grandison s case  however  don t say it is  Lucy  O what a partiality  Yet she has within these few minutes owned  that she thought the step she had taken a faulty one  before she came to me with the letter  and hoped to induce me to countenance her in what she had done   I called her a little Satan on this occasion  But  after all  what if the dear Charlotte s curiosity was more for my sake than her own  No motive of friendship  you will say  can justify a wrong action—Why no  Lucy  that is very true  but if you knew Miss Grandison  you would love her dearly   LETTER II  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  To Dr  BARTLETT     The Letter which Miss Byron refused to read  or hear read    Friday Night  Mar  17   I HOPE my Lord L  and my sisters will be able to make Colnebrooke so agreeable to Miss Byron   10 that I may have the pleasure of finding her there in the beginning of the week   My lord W  is in town  He has invited me to dine with him to morrow  and must not be denied  was a part of his message  brought me by Halden his steward  who says  That his lordship has something of consequence to consult me upon   When  my dear friend  shall I find time for myself  Pray make my compliments to my Lord L  and to my three sisters  and tell them from me  that when I have the happiness of being in their company  then it is that I think I give time to myself   I have a letter from Bologna  From the faithful Camilla  The contents of it give me great concern  She urges me to make one more visit there  She tells me  that the Bishop said in her hearing  it would be kind if I would  Were such a visit to be requested generally  and it were likely to be of service  you may believe that I would chearfully make it   I should go  for a fortnight at least  to Grandisonhall  Burgess has let me know  that the workmen have gone almost as far as they can go without my further orders  And the churchwardens have signified to me  that the church is completely beautified  according to my directions  so that it will be ready to be opened on the Sunday after next  at farthest  and intreat my presence  both as patron  and benefactor  I will now hasten my designed alterations at the Hall   I had rather not be present at the opening  Yet the propriety of my being there will probably prevail upon me to comply with the intreaties of the churchwardens  who in their letter signify the expectations of Sir Samuel Clarke  Sir William Turner  and Mr  Barnham  of seeing me  and my sister Charlotte  You will be pleased to mention this to her   I wish  without putting a slight upon good Mr  Dobson  that you  my dear friend  could oblige us with the first sermon  All then would be decent  and   11 worthy of the occasion  and the praise would be given properly  and not to the agent  But as it would be a little mortifying to Mr  Dobson  of whose praise only I am apprehensive  so much as to hint such a wish  I will write to him  that he will oblige me if he say not one word  that shall carry the eyes of the audience to my seat   The execution of the orders I gave  that five other pews should be equally distinguished and ornamented with mine  carries not with it the appearance of affectation
