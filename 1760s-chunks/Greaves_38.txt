 and at once attracted the whole attention of the populace  Timothy seeing his master fell down on his knees  crying   The thief has run away with Gilbertâ€”you may pound me into a peast  as the saying is  But now I se as mad as your worship  I an t afeard of the divil and all his works   Sir Launcelot desiring the beadle would forbear  was instantly obeyed by that officer  who had no inclination to put the authority of his place in competition with the power of such a figure  armed at all points  mounted on a fiery steed  and ready for the combat  He ordered Crabshaw to attend him to the next inn  where he alighted  then  taking him into a separate apartment  demanded an explanation of the unconnected words he had uttered   The squire was in such agitation  that  with infinite difficulty  and by dint of a thousand different questions  his master learned the adventure to this effect  Crabshaw  according to Sir Launcelot s command  had alighted from his horse  and drawn his cutlass  in hope of intimidating the discomfited robber into a tame surrender  though he did not at all relish the nature of the service  But the thief was neither so much hurt nor so tame as Timothy had imagined  He started on his feet with his pistol still in his hand  and presenting it to the squire  swore with dreadful imprecations  that he would blow his brains out in an instant  Crabshaw  unwilling to hazard the trial of this experiment  turned his back  and fled with great precipitation  while the robber  whose horse had run away  mounted Gilbert  and rode off across the country  It was at this period  that two footmen  belonging to the coach  who had stayed behind to take their morning s whet at the inn where they lodged  came up to the assistance of the ladies  armed with blunderbusses  and the carriage proceeded  leaving Timothy alone in distraction and despair  He knew not which way to turn  and was afraid of remaining on the spot  lest the robbers should come back and revenge themselves upon him for the disappointment they had undergone  In this distress  the first thought that occurred was to make the best of his way to the town  and demand the assistance of the civil magistrate towards the retrieval of what he had lost  a design which he executed in such a manner  as justly entailed upon him the imputation of lunacy   While Timothy stood fronting the window  and answering the interrogations of his master  he suddenly exclaimed   Bodikins  there s Gilbert   and sprung into the street with incredible agility  There finding his strayed companion brought back by one of the footmen who attended the coach  he imprinted a kiss on his forehead  and  hanging about his neck  with the tears in his eyes  hailed his return with the following salutation   Art thou come back  my darling  ah  Gilbert  Gilbert  a pize upon thee  thou hadst like to have been a dear Gilbert to me  how couldst thou break the heart of thy old friend  who has known thee from a colt  seven years next grass have I fed thee and bred thee  provided thee with sweet hay  delicate corn  and fresh litter  that thou mought lie warm  dry  and comfortable  Han t I currycombed thy carcass till it was as sleek as a sloe  and cherished thee as the apple of mine eye  for all that thou hast played me an hundred dog s tricks  biting  and kicking  and plunging  as if the devil was in thy body  and now thou couldst run away with a thief  and leave me to be flayed alive by measter  What canst thou say for thyself  thou cruel  hard hearted  unchristian tuoad   To this tender expostulation  which afforded much entertainment to the boys  Gilbert answered not one word  but seemed altogether insensible to the caresses of Timothy  who forthwith led him into the stable  On the whole  he seems to have been an unsocial animal  for it does not appear that he ever contracted any degree of intimacy  even with Bronzomarte  during the whole course of their acquaintance and fellowship  On the contrary  he has been more than once known to signify his aversion  by throwing out behind  and other eruptive marks of contempt for that elegant charger  who excelled him as much in personal merit  as his rider Timothy was outshone by his all accomplished master   While the squire accommodated Gilbert in the stable  the knight sent for the footman who had brought him back  and  having presented him with a liberal acknowledgment  desired to know in what manner the horse had been retrieved   The stranger satisfied him in this particular  by giving him to understand  that the highwayman  perceiving himself pursued across the country  plied Gilbert so severely with whip and spur  that the animal resented the usage  and being besides  perhaps  a little struck with remorse for having left his old friend Crabshaw  suddenly halted  and stood stock still  notwithstanding all the stripes and tortures he underwent  or if he moved at all  it
