 from the  peer to the peasant  that a gentleman and a foreigner  far from being  insulted and imposed upon by the lower class of people  as in England   was treated with the utmost reverence  candour  and respect  and their  fields were fertile  their climate pure healthy  their farmers rich and  industrious  the subjects in general the happiest of men  He would have  prosecuted this favourite theme still farther  had not his pupil been  obliged to run upon deck  in consequence of certain warnings he received  from his stomach   The skipper seeing his condition  very honestly reminded him of the cold  ham and fowls  with a basket of wine which he had ordered to be sent  on board  and asked if he would have the cloth laid below  He could  not have chosen a more seasonable opportunity of manifesting his own  disinterestedness  Peregrine made wry faces at the mention of food   bidding him  for Heaven s sake  talk no more on that subject  He then  descended into the cabin  and put the same question to Mr  Jolter  who   he knew  entertained the same abhorrence for his proposal  and meeting    6 22 15  3 45 PM   with the like reception from him  went between decks  and repeated his  courteous proffer to the valet de chambre and lacquey  who lay sprawling  in all the pangs of a double evacuation  and rejected his civility with  the most horrible loathing  Thus baffled in all his kind endeavours   he ordered the boy to secure the provision in one of his own lockers   according to the custom of the ship   It being low water when they arrived on the French coast  the vessel  could not enter the harbour  and they were obliged to bring to  and  wait for a boat  which in less than half an hour came alongside from the  shore  Mr  Jolter now came upon deck  and  snuffing up the French air  with symptoms of infinite satisfaction  asked of the boatmen  with the  friendly appellation of Mes enfants  what they demanded for transporting  him and his pupil with their baggage to the pier  But how was he  disconcerted  when those polite  candid  reasonable watermen demanded  a louis d or for that service  Peregrine  with a sarcastic sneer   observed  that he already began to perceive the justice of his encomiums  on the French  and the disappointed governor could say nothing in his  own vindication  but that they were debauched by their intercourse with  the inhabitants of Dover  His pupil  however  was so much offended at  their extortion  that he absolutely refused to employ them  even when  they abated one half in their demand  and swore he would stay on  board till the packet should be able to enter the harbour  rather than  encourage such imposition   The master  who in all probability had some sort of fellow feeling with  the boatmen  in vain represented that he could not with safety lie to  or anchor upon a lee shore  our hero  having consulted Pipes  answered   that he had hired his vessel to transport him to Calais  and that he  would oblige him to perform what he had undertaken  The skipper  very  much mortified at this peremptory reply  which was not over and above  agreeable to Mr  Jolter  dismissed the boat  notwithstanding the  solicitations and condescension of the watermen  Running a little  farther in shore  they came to an anchor  and waited till there was  water enough to float them over the bar  Then they stood into the  harbour  and our gentleman  with his attendants and baggage  were  landed on the pier by the sailors  whom he liberally rewarded for their  trouble   He was immediately plied by a great number of porters  who  like so  many hungry wolves  laid hold on his baggage  and began to carry it off  piecemeal  without his order or direction  Incensed at this officious  insolence  he commanded them to desist  with many oaths and opprobrious  terms that his anger suggested  and perceiving  that one of them did  not seem to pay any regard to what he said  but marched off with his  burthen  he snatched a cudgel out of his lacquey s hand  and overtaking  the fellow in a twinkling  brought him to the ground with one blow  He  was instantly surrounded by the whole congregation of this canaille  who  resented the injury which their brother had sustained  and would have  taken immediate satisfaction on the aggressor  had not Pipes  seeing his  master involved  brought the whole crew to his assistance  and exerted  himself so manfully that the enemy were obliged to retreat with many  marks of defeat  and menaces of interesting the commandant in their  quarrel  Jolter  who knew and dreaded the power of the French governor   began to shake with apprehension  when he heard their repeated  threats  but they durst not apply to this magistrate  who  upon a fair
