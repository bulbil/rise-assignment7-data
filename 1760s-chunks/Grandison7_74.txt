Sir Charles  my ever to be respected friend  I am easy in my mind  I could not bear in my thoughts  that any thing I knew  which it concerned you to know  should be concealed from you   Tears stood in her eyes  O madam  said she to me  God and you only can reward this excellent man for his goodness to me  and all the world that know him —You see your influence  Chevalier  In every way do I wish to shew my gratitude  But never  never  ask me to give my hand in marriage   Ah  my dear Lady  thought I  a tear stealing involuntarily down my cheek  the less  the less  I doubt  must you be asked  for having before you a man  who having no equal  you cannot think of any other   The two Ladies hurried away to Lady L s  How sincerely has the friendly heart of dear Lady L  been affected in all these tender scenes   LETTER XXXIX  Lady GRANDISON  In Continuation   Thursday evening  March 29   LADY G  has sent for me in all haste  She is taken ill  God give her a happy hour   O my grandmamma  there are solemn  there are awful  circumstances in the happiest marriages  She begs to see her brother as well as me  I wait for him  The Count of Belvedere is with him —They have parted—I am gone   Thursday night   JUST returned  All happily over  A fine girl —Yet tho  a fine one  how are the Earl and Lady Gertrude   190 disappointed —Poor mortals  how hard to be pleased   The brave are always humane  Sir Charles s tender and polite behaviour on this occasion—How does every occurrence endear him to every body   How dearly does Lord G  love his Charlotte  Till all was over  he was in agonies for her safety  His prayers then  his thankfulness now  how ought they to endear them to his Charlotte  And so they must  when she is told of his anxiety  and of his honest joy  or I will not own her for my Sister  But in her heart  I am sure  she loves him  Her past idle behaviour to him was but play  She will be matronized now  The mother must make her a wife  She will doubly disgrace herself  if she loves her child  and can make a jest of her husband   I have just now asked Sir Charles  whether  if he could prevail on Lady Clementina  while they were all with us  to give her hand to the Count of Belvedere  he would  By no means  said he  and that for both their sakes  Lady Clementina has  on many occasions  shewn that she may be prevailed upon by generous and patient treatment  Let the Count have patience  If she recover her mind  a train of chearful ideas may take place of those melancholy ones  which make her desirous of quitting society  She will find herself  by the articles agreed to  in a situation to do more good  than it is possible she could do  were her inclination to take the veil to be gratified  The good she will do  will open and enlarge a mind which is naturally noble  and she will be grateful for the indulgence given her  which will be the means of so happy a change  But if the poor Lady s mind be not curable  which God forbid   who will pity the Count for not being able to obtain her hand —I think  my dear  I have made him  tho  not happy  easy  and I hope he will be able to see her without violent emotions     191  Friday morn   SIGNORS Sebastiano and Juliano are come back  rejoicing that they have been introduced to  and kindly received by  Lady Clementina   Sir Edward Beauchamp has just left me  How happy does the account he gives of my Emily s chearfulness make me  I knew you would all love her   Sincerely do I rejoice in the news which my Nancy confirms  that Lucy has absolutely rejected the addresses of Mr  Greville  She startled me once  I can tell her  A naughty girl  what could she mean by it   Won t she give me the particulars under her own hand  I shall be afraid of her till she does  so much was I impressed by her warmth in the argument she once held with me  in his favour  as I thought  Yet I cordially wish Mr  Greville well  but my Lucy better  Pray  madam  let me privately know  if the proposals from the young Irish peer  a   whom Nancy praises so much for his sobriety  modesty  learning  and other good qualities  were made before or after the rejecting of Mr  Greville  I half mistrust the girls who have been disappointed of a first Love  Yet Lucy s victory over herself was a noble one  She is in the way  I hope  to be rewarded for it  God grant it—Think you  my dear grandmamma  I can be solicitous
