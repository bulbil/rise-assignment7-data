of burgundy  which inflamed his passion to such a degree  that  he found himself capable of undertaking and perpetrating any scheme for  the gratification of his desire   Emilia  warmed by so many concurring incentives  in favour of the man  she loved  abated considerably of her wonted reserve  listened to his  protestations with undissembled pleasure  and  in the confidence of her  satisfaction  even owned him absolute master of her affections  Ravished  with this confession  he now deemed himself on the brink of reaping the  delicious fruits of his art and assiduity  and the morning being already  pretty far advanced  assented with rapture to the first proposal she  made of retiring to her lodgings  The blinds of the chariot being pulled  up  he took advantage of the favourable situation of her thoughts   and  on pretence of being whimsical  in consequence of the wine he had  swallowed  clasped her in his arms  and imprinted a thousand kisses  on her pouting lips  a freedom which she pardoned as the privilege of  intoxication  While he thus indulged himself with impunity  the carriage  halted  and Pipes opening the door  his master handed her into the  passage  before she perceived that it was not her uncle s house at which  they had alighted   Alarmed at this discovery  she  with some confusion  desired to know his  reason for conducting her to a strange place at these hours  But he made  no reply  until he had led her into an apartment  when he gave her to  understand  that  as her uncle s family must be disturbed by her going  thither so late in the night  and the streets near Temple bar were  infested by a multitude of robbers and cut throats  he had ordered his  coachman to halt at this house  which was kept by a relation of his  a  mighty good sort of a gentlewoman  who would be proud of an opportunity  to accommodate a person for whom he was known to entertain such  tenderness and esteem   Emilia had too much penetration to be imposed upon by this plausible  pretext  In spite of her partiality for Peregrine  which had never been  inflamed to such a pitch of complacency before  she comprehended his  whole plan in a twinkling  Though her blood boiled with indignation  she  thanked him with an affected air of serenity for his kind concern  and    6 22 15  3 45 PM   expressed her obligation to his cousin  but  at the same time  insisted  upon going home  lest her absence should terrify her uncle and aunt   who  she knew  would not retire to rest till her return   He urged her  with a thousand remonstrances  to consult her own ease and  safety  promising to send Pipes into the city  for the satisfaction of  her relations  But  finding her obstinately deaf to his entreaties  he  assured her  that he would  in a few minutes  comply with her request   and  in the meantime  begged she would fortify herself against the cold  with a cordial  which he poured out in her presence  and which  now that  her suspicion was aroused  she refused to taste  notwithstanding all  his importunities  He then fell on his knees before her  and the tears  gushing from his eyes  swore that his passion was wound up to such a  pitch of impatience  that he could no longer live upon the unsubstantial  food of expectation  and that  if she would not vouchsafe to crown his  happiness  he would forthwith sacrifice himself to her disdain  Such an  abrupt address  accompanied with all the symptoms of frantic agitation   could not fail to perplex and affright the gentle Emilia  who  after  some recollection  replied with a resolute tone  that she could not  see what reason he had to complain of her reserve  which she was not  at liberty to lay entirely aside  until he should have avowed his  intentions in form  and obtained the sanction of those whom it was  her duty to obey   Divine creature   cried he  seizing her hand   and pressing it to his lips   it is from you alone I hope for that  condescension  which would overwhelm me with the transports of celestial  bliss  The sentiments of parents are sordid  silly  and confined  I  mean not then to subject my passion to such low restrictions as were  calculated for the purposes of common life  My love is too delicate and  refined to wear those vulgar fetters  which serve only to destroy the  merit of voluntary affection  and to upbraid a man incessantly with the  articles of compulsion  under which he lies  My dear angel  spare me the  mortification of being compelled to love you  and reign sole empress  of my heart and fortune  I will not affront you so much as to talk of  settlements  my all is at your disposal  In this pocket book are notes  to the amount of two thousand pounds  do me the pleasure to accept of
