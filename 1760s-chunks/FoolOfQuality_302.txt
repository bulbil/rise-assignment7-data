   according to his faith it was done unto him    ac    cording to his lust his desire was accomplished   his nature became a   partaker of temporary nature   and he fell  with his progeny  into all   the depravity and evils that the sin of fallen Lucifer had introduced   into these vast regions  now made more exceedingly corrupt and   sinful by the sin of fallen Adam      Why  pray  sir  demanded Harry  had Lucifer any concern in this   world before the fall of our first parents       Yes  my dear   all the space that is now occupied by this earth   and these elements  with the sun  moon  and stars  to an incon    ceivable extent  was once the heaven and dominion of Lucifer and   his angels  But when  by their apostasy from the light  and love    and goodness of God  they had caused darkness and malignity    envy  rage  and uproar  and every species of evil and horror  to be   predominant throughout their kingdom  God determined  by a new   creation  to take it out of their hands  Accordingly he compacted   it into the present system of temporary nature  whose duration is   to be measured by the revolution of our luminaries  until the ap          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  329     pointed period of the great consummation  when all the malignity   that remains and is compacted therein  shall be finally done   away      To this truth Moses bears testimony  where he tells you that  at   the commencement of the creation  darkness was upon the face of   the great deep  And again  where he tells you  that the tree of the   knowledge of the goods and evils of this world sprung up even in   the midst of the paradise of God  But it is altogether impious and   blasphemous to suppose that God would create evil  or infuse a   tendency thereto into any of his works  Again  the same truth is   attested by many passages of the sacred writings  where Lucifer    or Satan  tells Christ to his face  that this world  with all its glories    are his portion and property   that they were delivered unto him     and that he giveth them to whomsoever he will  And again  where   Christ calls him   the prince of the air     and again  where he says      The prince of this Avorld cometh  and hath no part in me       Now when God  by this new creation  had delivered this system   of things from the influence and dominion of evil spirits  they   became altogether prisoners in their own darkness  But when   Adam  the second lord of this vast domain  by a second apostasy   had brought additional sin and evil into temporary nature  the para    dise of God  that was over all  vanished   and the new guilt of   Adam opened a new and wide gate for the re admission of Lucifer   into his ancient possessions  And he remains a prince and a ruler   in the elements and hearts of men unto this evil day      These two capital apostates  Lucifer and Adam  who had thus   robbed their kind God of their affections and allegiance  were there    after represented by the two thieves who suffered in company with   Christ  who reached out to each of them a bleeding arm of his   mercy  The one accepted his grace  and on that day entered para    dise along with his Lord  The other rejected the Christ with con    tempt and reproach  and therefore  if ever reclaimable  must be con    strained by suffering to open his heart to redemption   when  after   a process of many agonizing ages  blaspheming and indignantly   spurning at the power of his punisher  he may be compelled to cry   out seed of the woman   heal  heal the head thou hast crushed    and admit me also  though last  to some  the least portion of thy   pardoning salvation       These two  my Harry  even Lucifer and Adam  were also the   thieves among whom the traveller fell  going from Jerusalem to   Jericho  from the city and place of peace to the place of destruc    tion  He represented the wretched race of fallen man  whom   Lucifer  and their first father  had robbed of all their substance    and stripped of their robe of righteousness  and wounded and left   half dead in trespasses and sins  Neither did the law or the priest    hood avail anything for their cure  till
