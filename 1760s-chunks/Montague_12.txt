 a distant relation of her mother s  Adieu  ma tres chere     LETTER XI   11    To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Quebec  Sept  10   I FIND  my dear  that absence and amusement are the best remedies for a beginning passion  I have passed a fortnight at the Indian village of Lorette  where the novelty of the scene  and the enquiries I have been led to make into their antient religion and manners  have been of a thousand times more service to me than all the reflection in the world would have been       I will own to you that I staid too long at Montreal  or rather at Major Melmoth s  to be six weeks in the same house with one of the most amiable  most pleasing of women  was a trying situation to a heart full of sensibility  and of a sensibility which has been hitherto  from a variety of causes  a good deal restrained  I should have avoided the danger from the first  had it appeared to me what it really was  but I thought myself secure in the consideration of her engagements  a defence however which I found grow weaker every day       But to my savages  other nations talk of liberty  they possess it  nothing can be more astonishing than to see a little village of about thirty or forty families  the small remains of the Hurons  almost exterminated by long and continual war with the Iroquoise  preserve their independence in the midst of an European colony consisting of seventy thousand inhabitants  yet the fact is true of the savages of Lorette  they assert and they maintain that independence with a spirit truly noble  One of our company having said something which an Indian understood as a supposition that they had been subjects of France  his eyes struck fire  he stop d him abruptly  contrary to their respectful and sensible custom of never interrupting the person who speaks   You mistake  brother   said he   we are subjects to no prince  a savage is free all over the world   And he spoke only truth  they are not only free as a people  but every individual is perfectly so  Lord of himself  at once subject and master  a savage knows no superior  a circumstance which has a striking effect on his behaviour  unawed by rank or riches  distinctions unknown amongst his own nation  he would enter as unconcerned  would possess all his powers as freely in the palace of an oriental monarch  as in the cottage of the meanest peasant   tis the species   tis man   tis his equal he respects  without regarding the gaudy trappings  the accidental advantages  to which polished nations pay homage       I have taken some pains to develop their present  as well as past  religious sentiments  because the Jesuit missionaries have boasted so much of their conversion  and find they have rather engrafted a few of the most plain and simple truths of Christianity on their ancient superstitions  than exchanged one faith for another  they are baptized  and even submit to what they themselves call the yoke of confession  and worship according to the outward forms of the Romish church  the drapery of which cannot but strike minds unused to splendor  but their belief is very little changed  except that the women seem to pay great reverence to the Virgin  perhaps because flattering to the sex  They anciently believed in one God  the ruler and creator of the universe  whom they called the Great Spirit and the Master of Life  in the sun as his image and representative  in a multitude of inferior spirits and demons  and in a future state of rewards and punishments  or  to use their own phrase  in a country of souls  They reverenced the spirits of their departed heroes  but it does not appear that they paid them any religious adoration  Their morals were more pure  their manners more simple  than those of polished nations  except in what regarded the intercourse of the sexes  the young women before marriage were indulged in great libertinism  hid however under the most reserved and decent exterior  They held adultery in abhorrence  and with the more reason as their marriages were dissolvable at pleasure  The missionaries are said to have found no difficulty so great in gaining them to Christianity  as that of persuading them to marry for life  they regarded the Christian system of marriage as contrary to the laws of nature and reason  and asserted that  as the Great Spirit formed us to be happy  it was opposing his will  to continue together when otherwise       The sex we have so unjustly excluded from power in Europe have a great share in the Huron government  the chief is chose by the matrons from amongst the nearest male relations  by the female line  of him he is to succeed  and is generally an aunt s or sister s son  a custom which  if we examine strictly into the principle on which it is founded  seems a little to contradict what we are told of the extreme chastity of the married ladies       The power of the chief is extremely limited  he seems rather to advise his people as a father than
