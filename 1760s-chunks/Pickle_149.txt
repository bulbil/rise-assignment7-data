 sacrifice all her esteem  for him to her own zeal for the glory of the French nation  Moved by  this apprehension  his ardour cooled by degrees  and he insensibly  detached himself from the argument  leaving the whole care of supporting  it to the Jew  who  finding himself deserted  was fain to yield at  discretion  so that the French remained masters of the field  and their  young heroine resumed her good humour   Our hero having prudently submitted to the superior intelligence of his  fair enslaver  began to be harassed with the fears of losing her  for ever  and set his invention at work  to contrive some means  of indemnifying himself for his assiduities  presents  and the  disappointment he had already undergone  On pretence of enjoying a free  air  he mounted the box  and employed his elocution and generosity with  such success  that the driver undertook to disable the diligence from  proceeding beyond the town of Alost for that day  and  in consequence  of his promise  gently overturned it when they were but a mile short of  that baiting place  He had taken his measures so discreetly  that this  accident was attended with no other inconvenience than a fit of fear  that took possession of the ladies  and the necessity to which they  were reduced by the declaration of the coachman  who  upon examining  the carriage  assured the company that the axle tree had given way  and  advised them to walk forward to the inn  while he would jog after them  at a slow pace  and do his endeavour the damage should be immediately  repaired   Peregrine pretended to be very much concerned at what had happened   and even cursed the driver for his inadvertency  expressing infinite    6 22 15  3 45 PM   impatience to be at Brussels  and wishing that this misfortune might  not detain them another night upon the road  but when his understrapper   according to his instructions  came afterwards to the inn  and gave them  to understand that the workman he had employed could not possibly refit  the machine in less then six hours  the crafty youth affected to  lose all temper  stormed at his emissary  whom he reviled in the most  opprobrious terms  and threatened to cane for his misconduct  The fellow  protested  with great humility  that their being overturned was owing to  the failure of the axle tree  and not to his want of care or dexterity  in driving  though rather than be thought the cause of incommoding  him  he would inquire for a post chaise  in which he might depart for  Brussels immediately  This expedient Pickle rejected  unless the whole  company could be accommodated in the same manner  and he had been  previously informed by the driver that the town could not furnish more  than one vehicle of that sort  His governor  who was quite ignorant  of his scheme  represented that one night would soon be passed  and  exhorted him to bear this small disappointment with a good grace   especially as the house seemed to be well provided for their  entertainment  and the company so much disposed to be sociable   The Capuchin  who had found his account in cultivating the acquaintance  of the young stranger  was not ill pleased at this event  which might   by protracting the term of their intercourse  yield him some opportunity  of profiting still farther by his liberality  he therefore joined Mr   Jolter in his admonitions  congratulating himself upon the prospect  of enjoying his conversation a little longer than he had expected   Our young gentleman received a compliment to the same purpose from  the Hebrew  who had that day exercised his gallantry upon the French  coquette  and was not without hope of reaping the fruit of his  attention  his rival  the painter  being quite disgraced and dejected  by the adventure of last night  As for the doctor  he was too much  engrossed in the contemplation of his own importance  to interest  himself in the affair or its consequences  further than by observing   that the European powers ought to establish public games  like those  that were celebrated of old in Greece  in which case  every state would  be supplied with such dexterous charioteers as would drive a machine  at  full speed  within a hair s breadth of a precipice  without any danger  of its being overturned   Peregrine could not help yielding to their remonstrances and united  complaisance  for which he thanked them in very polite terms  and his  passion seeming to subside  proposed that they should amuse themselves  in walking round the ramparts  He hoped to enjoy some private  conversation with his admired Fleming  who had the whole day behaved  with remarkable reserve  The proposal being embraced  he  as usual   handed her into the street  and took all opportunities of promoting his  suit  but they were attended so closely by her father confessor  that  he foresaw it would be impracticable to accomplish his aim without the  connivance of that ecclesiastic  This he was obliged to purchase with
