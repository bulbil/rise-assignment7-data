high spirits  my heart beating with expectation  and never past a more languid day  I fancied every moment would be pleasanter  but found the last hour as spiritless as the first  I saw chagrin and disappointment in the eyes of half the company  especially the younger part of it  Lady Julia seemed to          2 70       say   All this would be charming  if Harry Mandeville was here   My own ideas were something similar  I could not keep my imagination from wandering a little to Grosvenor street  most of the misses were in the same situation  whilst the good old people seemed perfectly satisfied  which convinces me that  at a certain time of life  there is no pleasure without the heart  where that is untouched  and takes no part in your amusements  all is still life and vegetation  it is in vain to expect enjoyment from outward objects  where the soul is from home      I missed my sweet Harry exceedingly  for  though not a lover  he is a divine fellow  and there is something vastly amusing in having so agreeable an object before one s eyes            2 71          Whenever I make a party of pleasure  it shall consist all of lovers  who have not met for a twelvemonth        Who should we meet on our return  but Fondville  in a superb barge  full of company  dying at the feet of the Cittadina  who was singing a melting Italian air  Yes  we are to be Lady Viscountess Fondville  all is agreed  the cloaths bespoke  our very garters interwoven with coronets  I shall get off before the days of visitation  for there will be no supporting Madame la Viscomtesse        I have been talking half an hour tete Ã  tete with Lady Mary  and have let her into the secret of little Westbrook s passion for Harry  She drew up at the very mention  was astonished  that a creature of yesterday could think of mixing his blood with that of Mandeville  and declared she knew but twenty houses in Europe into which she should ever consent to Harry s marrying            2 72          I took this opportunity of giving a hint of his inclination for Lady Julia  but am doubtful whether she understood me  Oh  that he had Lord Melvin s expectations  But why do I wish for impossibilities  Let me rather wish  what is next to impossible  that Lord Belmont would overlook the want of them     Adieu      To Colonel Bellville   Thursday Evening      O Ciel  Une avanture  Making use of the sweet liberty of Belmont  which has no rule but that of the Thelemites   Do what thou wilt   I left them after dinner to settle family affairs  and ordered my chariot to take a solitary airing  an old cat  however  arriving just as it          2 73       came to the door  who is a famous proficient in scandal  a treat I am absolutely deprived of at Belmont  I changed my mind  and asked her to accompany me  that I might be amused with the secret history of all the neighbourhood      She had torn to pieces half a dozen of the prettiest women about us  when  passing through a little village about six miles from Belmont  I was struck with the extreme neatness of a small house and garden near the road  there was an elegant plainness in the air of it  which pleased me so much that I pulled the string  and ordered the coachman to stop  that I might examine it more at leisure  I was going to bid him drive on  when two women came out of an arbor  one of whom instantly engaged all my attention        Imagine to yourself in such a place all that is graceful and lovely in woman  an          2 74       elegance of form and habit  a dignity of deportment  an air of delicate languor and sensibility  which won the heart at a look  a complexion inclining to pale  the finest dark eyes  with a countenance in which a modest sorrow and dignified dejection gave the strongest indications of suffering merit      My companion  seeing the apparent partiality with which I beheld this amiable object  began to give me the history of her  embittered by all the virulence of malice  which  however  amounted to no more  than that she was a stronger  and that  as nobody knew who she was  they generously concluded she was one whose interest it was not to be known        They now drew nearer to us  and the charming creature  raising her eyes  and then first seeing us  exclaimed  Good Heaven  Lady Anne
