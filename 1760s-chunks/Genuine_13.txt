  60This humble behaviour of Miss ELLIOT induced her compassionate creditor to soften a little  so that her proposal was complied with  and she released  after giving a promissary note to her benefactress  and therby devoting herself to the service of a wretch lost to virtue  justice  and humanity   The unfortunate Miss ELLIOT  in consequence of the late favour she received from Mrs  LAMB  became an absolute slave to the most mercenary and abandoned of women  who had long lived on the wages of prostitution  and was disposed for the commission of all that is vile and base  if it could administer to her luxury and avarice  Being wholly dependent on her for board  lodging  and clothes  she was treated in the most haughty and supercilious manner  frequently threatened with being sent back to her old lodging  and sometimes bore the marks of her landlady s displeasure   Having  incurred a considerable debt and standing very high in Mrs  LAMB S   61 books  she dreaded entering her lodgings at the close of a night s incursion without money  therefore  when she met with no success  she would parade the streets very late  which circumstance added a new weight to her former woes  It unfortunately happened  that  walking the Strand on a search night  she was seized by a constable  and  notwithstanding her remonstrances  forced away to the round house  She now found herself under the disagreeable necessity of passing the remainder of the night there  as she was incapable of bribing the constable  who never objected to a genteel offer from the hands of an unfortunate woman   Our heroine  whose spirits were not the most easily dejected  was nevertheless terrified at this outrage  and gave vent to her grief in a slood of tears   The humane constable  perceiving her concern  advised her to have something to comfort her  and without waiting for her reply sent for a bottle of wine   She began to entertain some opinion of this officer s compassion  and readily accepted   62 the glass he offered her  but was soon convinced that she was to be treated at her own expence  for the man  who brought the wine  waited till she paid him for it the last half crown she had in the world   She had now plucked up spirits sufficient to enquire  whether she could not get a person to go and acquaint a friend with what had befallen her  but it being by this time past twelve  they pretended they could find no body to go till the men came off the watch   While she was lamenting her fate in being thus illegally confined  without being guilty of the least outrage  there was a knocking at the door of the round house  which at first elated her heart  hoping that her landlady might  from suspicion of her being there  have sent some person to her relief  But her joy was soon turned into sorrow  for upon opening the door  her ears were saluted with a volley of oaths from an elderly lady  who  she afterwards understood  sustained the honourable character of a bawd  This good   63 lady did not come unattended  one of her nymphs  with whom she had charged the watch for detaining her property by force  had in her turn charged her for breaking the peace  and forcibly entering her apartments   After some wrangle between them  the constable told them  they had better settle matters over a bottle  as it would only tend to their mutual disadvantage to go before the justice in the morning  The young lady readily agreed to have not only one bottle  but half a dozen  swearing  lustily  however  she would not let that old b—h cheat her in the manner she had done   In a short time  the constable  the beadle  his wife  the bawd  and the nymph  jovially intoxicated themselves  and by five in the morning were joining in the agreeable concert of their nostrils   Miss ELLIOT might have made her escape now  but as she knew they could alledge nothing against her  and she must have exposed herself in the neighbourhood   64 by returning at that time in the morning▪ she remained till they awoke  in order to be conducted before a worthy magistrate   The vigilant guardians of the night having proclaimed the hour of six  returned to deposit their lanthorns and staves  and the inebriate prisoners and guests began to yawn for repose  It was too early to disturb his worship  and the generous nymph  who had so bountifully supplied them with wine  procured them coffee and tea for breakfast  of which our heroine  after her fatigue  was easily prevailed on to partake   Miss ELLIOT had received several hints the former part of the evening  that by a proper present to the officer  she might obtain her liberty  but  for urgent reasons  she was obliged to decline such an offer  though she would gladly have proposed it  had it been in her power   The worthy officers of the night now began to make the necessary preparations for conducting the prisoners to the magistrate  at whose residence  when they arrived   65 they remained some time in the antichamber  before they could gain
