they were obliged to follow him in his campaigns  and he might command the people  from that fondness which the vulgar have for a conqueror  Richard  however  was no way warlike  but  being bred up in the luxury and pride   144 of a court  still expected deference and obedience  which could  at that time  be obtained only by merit in war   Having  by the removal of his favourites  rendered himself still more feeble than before  he now ran into profusion  and endeavoured to forget his real weakness  in extravagance and luxury  Such expences necessarily created new demands upon the people  and they were bold enough to refuse  this necessarily produced new insurrections  and reiterated punishments on the part of the King  Punishment and arbitrary proceedings generally produce but a temporary and fatal security  Richard  however  insensible of this  imagined that now was the time to render himself despotic  and had even influence sufficient to prevail upon a parliament  called in the year 1397  to justify his pretensions  By this merciless session  several of the nobility lost their lives  the Archbishop of Canterbury was banished  the Earl of Arundel put to death  and the Earl of Warwick sentenced to quit the kingdom   Every thing seemed to contribute to support the King in the acquisition of his new created power  The most forward to oppose his designs had suffered death or banishment  and they who still remained  were bribed to acquiesce  by pensions  grants  and places  The great officers of the crown  the governors of the towns and counties  were all devoted to his interest  yet  all this was but a deceitful security  this was a power founded upon interest or terror alone  and not upon affection  the people hated him  and the generality of the nobles only obeyed him through constraint     145 In this manner did this giddy Monarch suffer himself to be deluded by vain hopes  and every day gave some new instance of straining the royal prerogative beyond what it could bear  but soon an opportunity offered to induce the people to refuse a blind obedience to his unjust commands  and to convince him of his former errors  a charge happening to be exhibited by the Duke of Hereford against the Duke of Norfolk  for having spoken seditious words against his Majesty  in a private conversation  for want of sufficient proof to support the accusation  it was decreed  by the lords in parliament  that the dispute should be decided by single combat  according to the laws of chivalry  still in fashion  The time and the place were appointed for the determining this affair  and the combatants met accordingly  It may not be amiss to describe the ceremonies upon that occasion   Hereford  the challenger  first appeared  on a white courser  gaily caparisoned  armed at all points  with his drawn sword in his hand  when he approached the lists  the Mareschal demanded who he was  to which he answered     I am Henry of Lancaster  Duke of Hereford  come hither  according to my duty  against Thomas Mowbray  Duke of Norfolk  a false traitor to God  the King  the realm  and me    Then  taking the oath that his quarrel was just and true  he desired to enter the lists  which being granted  he sheathed his sword  pulled down his beaver  crossed himself on the forehead  seized his lance  passed the barrier  alighted and sate down in a chair of green velvet  placed at one end of the lists  He had scarce taken his seat  when the King came into the field with great pomp  attended by the peers the Count of St  Pol  who came from France   146 on purpose to see this famous trial  and ten thousand men at arms to prevent tumults and disturbance  His Majesty  being seated in his chair of state  the King at Arms proclaimed  that none but such as were appoined to marshal the field  should presume to touch the lists  upon pain of death  Then another herald proclaimed aloud    Behold here Henry of Lancaster  Duke of Hereford  who has entered the lists to perform his devoir against Thomas Mowbray  Duke of Norfolk  on pain of being counted false and recreant    The Duke of Norfolk immediately appeared in arms  mounted upon a barbed horse  with a coat of arms of crimson velvet  embroidered with lions of silver and mulberry trees  and  having taken his oath before the constable and mareschal  entered the field  exclaiming aloud    God defend the right    Alighting from his horse  he placed himself in a chair of crimson velvet  opposite to his antagonist  at the other end of the lists  then the Mareschal  having measured their lances  delivered one to the challenger  and sent a Knight with the other to the Duke of Norfolk  and proclamation was made that they should prepare for the combat  They immediately mounted their horses  thn closed their beavers  fixed their lances on the rests  and  the trumpets sounding a charge  the Duke of Hereford began his career with great violence  but  before he could join his antagonist
