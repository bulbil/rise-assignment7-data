pitch of superstition  that it would have been an easy matter to  persuade them that the chair and table were apparitions of their  forefathers  However  they conducted Peregrine into the council chamber   where the conjurer and Hadgi were employed in ministering to those who  had fainted   The patients having retrieved the use of their faculties  Cadwallader   assuming a double portion of severity in his aspect  asked if they were  not ashamed of their former incredulity  declaring  that he was ready  to give them more convincing proofs of his art upon the spot  and would  immediately recall three generations of their progenitors from the dead   if they were disposed to relish such company  Then turning to one of  them  whose grandfather had been hanged   Are you   said he   ambitious  of seeing the first remarkable personage of your family  Say the word  and he shall appear    This youth  who had been the most insolent and obstreperous in the whole  society  and was now depressed with the same proportion of fear  alarmed  at the proposal  assured the magician he had no curiosity of that sort  remaining  and that what he had already seen would  he hoped  have a  good effect upon his future life and conversation  Every one of these  heroes made an acknowledgment and profession of the same kind  some of  which were attended with tears  and Hadgi having provided chairs for the  whole company  they departed exceedingly crest fallen  Two of the number  actually sickened with the agitation they had undergone  while our  hero and his associate made themselves merry with the success of their  enterprise   But this scheme of fortune telling did not engross his whole attention   he still continued to maintain his appearance in the beau monde  and  as  his expense far exceeded his income  strove to contract intimacies with  people of interest and power  he showed himself regularly at court  paid  his respects to them in all places of public diversion  and frequently  entered into their parties  either of pleasure or cards  In the  course of this cultivation  he happened one evening  at a certain  chocolate house  to overlook a match of piquet  in which he perceived  a couple of sharpers making a prey of a young nobleman  who had neither    6 22 15  3 45 PM   temper nor skill sufficient to cope with such antagonists   Our hero  being a professed enemy to all knights of industry  could  not bear to see them cheat in public with such insolent audacity  Under  pretence of communicating some business of importance  he begged the  favour of speaking to the young gentleman in another corner of the  room  and in a friendly manner cautioned him against his opponents  This  hot headed representative  far from thinking or owning himself obliged  to Pickle for his good counsel  looked upon his advice as an insult upon  his understanding  and replied  with an air of ferocious displeasure   that he knew how to take care of his own concerns  and would not suffer  either him or them to bubble him out of a shilling   Peregrine  offended at the association  as well as at the ingratitude  and folly of this conceited coxcomb  expressed his resentment  by  telling him  that he expected at least an acknowledgment for his candid  intention  but he found his intellects too much warped by his vanity  to perceive his own want of capacity and experience  Inflamed by this  reproof  the young nobleman challenged him to play for five hundred  pounds  with many opprobrious  or at least contemptuous terms of  defiance  which provoked our hero to accept the proposal  After the  other had disengaged himself from the old rooks  who were extremely  mortified at the interruption  the two young champions sat down  and  fortune acting with uncommon impartiality  Pickle  by the superiority of  his talents  in two hours won to the amount of as many thousand pounds   for which he was obliged to take his antagonist s note  the sharpers  having previously secured his ready money   Frantic with his loss  the rash young man would have continued the game   and doubled stakes every time  so that Peregrine might have increased  his acquisition to ten times the sum he had gained  but he thought he  had already sufficiently chastised the presumption of the challenger   and was unwilling to empower fortune to ravish from him the fruits of  his success  he therefore declined my lord s proposal  unless he would  play for ready money  and his lordship having in vain tried his credit  among the company  our adventurer withdrew  leaving him in an ecstasy of  rage and disappointment   As the insolence of his behaviour had increased with his ill luck  and  he had given vent to divers expressions which Peregrine took amiss  our  young gentleman resolved to augment his punishment  by teasing him with  demands which could not  he knew  be immediately satisfied  and next day  sent Pipes to his father s house with the note
