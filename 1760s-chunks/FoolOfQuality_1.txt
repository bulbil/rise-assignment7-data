THE     FOOL OF QUALITY         BY     HENRY BROOKE         WITH A BIOGRAPHICAL PREFACE BY   CHARLES KINGSLEY     AND A NEW LIFE OF THE AUTHOR BY   E  A  BAKER  M A          LONDON        ORGE ROUTLEDGE AND SONS  LIMITED   NEW YORK   E  P  DUTTON   Co            Printed in Great Britain         INTRODUCTION     ANY further introduction to an author whom Charles   Kingsley ushered in with so eulogistic a preface would   be a work of supererogation  had not the opportunity   arisen of making some additions to the little that is   generally known about Henry Brooke  Kingsley s preface   has been retained in the present edition of The Fool of   Quality  for it is now identified with the book in a way   that few prefaces are at all events  such as are written to   introduce other men s work  It contains the finest portrait   we have of the character of Brooke  a portrait that has the   charm of eloquence and enthusiasm  and displays the in    sight born of complete and fervent sympathy  Kingsley had   the good luck to find  in a writer who had preceded him by   nearly a century  a man singularly like himself in tempera    ment  in imagination  in social  ethical  and religious ideas    No proper biography of Henry Brooke existing for   Kingsley s account is  after all  only a sketch there is   no excuse needed for trying to fill in the outlines with a   few fresh details  For much of the material to be used   for this purpose I am indebted to Mr  Henry Brooke of   Liverpool  a descendant of Robert  the younger brother of   the Counsellor Brooke  as he was familiarly known in his   own day  author of The Fool of Quality  Mr  Brooke has   kindly supplied the appended family tree  which he has   taken considerable pains to verify  and has lent for repro    duction the life like monochrome portrait which is included   here  He has also put at my disposal  for the purposes of   this introduction  his interesting collection of Brooke papers   and letters  I am further much indebted for a number of   references and other notes to Mr  Ernest Falser  who has   made a special study of the life and works of the author    Several of the references to the contemporary press are due   to the researches of Mr  J  K  Bowling      As the reader who casts an eye over this introduction   will doubtless peruse Kingsley s preface  I will not worry         vi INTRODUCTION     him with repetition  but will refer him to that for a more   connected account of our author  This is  in the main    but an attempt to fill up some of the lacunae  First let   me deal with Brooke s ancestry  no unimportant matter    for  as a critic points out  the mingling of Sheridan    Fitzgerald  and Digby blood with the religious nature of   the Brookes was bound  sooner or later  to produce a man   like Henry Brooke and a book like The Fool of Quality    Henry Brooke was the second of three sons of the Rev    William Brooke  and not  as hitherto stated  the elder of   two  The eldest was Digby Brooke  born 1697  in County   Cavan  and educated by his father  He entered Trinity   College  Dublin  in 1714  graduated B A  in 1719  and   M A  in 1722  What happened to him afterwards cannot   be traced  It is probable that he died young  as there is   no mention of him either in the old biographies or in the   letters and papers left by his nephews and nieces  who refer   to two brothers only Ht nry  the elder  and Robert  The   father  the Rev  William Brooke  of Rantavan  born 1669    died 1745   was the eldest of three brothers  sons of   William Brooke  a physician in County Cavan  He was   rector of Moybolgue  now Bailie   borough   Mullagh    Killinkere  Innismngrath  Kildallon  and Lavey  a very   large area in the same county  and is also stated to have   been chaplain to King William  In a memoir prefixed to   the Reliques of Irish Poetry  by Henry Brooke s daughter    Charlotte  he is described as  a person of considerable   talents and amiable worth
