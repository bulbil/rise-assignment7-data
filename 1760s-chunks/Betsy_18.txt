attended to          Miss Betsy had now no person that professed a serious passion for her    but  as she had yet never seen the man capable of inspiring her with the   least emotions of tenderness  she was quite easy as to that point  and   wished nothing beyond what she enjoyed  the pleasure of being told she   was very handsome  and gallanted about by a great number of those who go   by the name of very pretty fellows  Pleased with the praise  she   regarded not the condition or merits of the praised  and suffered   herself to be treated  presented  and squired about to all publick   places  either by the rake  the man of honour  the wit  or the fool  the   married as well as the unmarried  without distinction  and just as   either fell in her way       Such a conduct as this could not fail of laying her open to the censure   of malicious tongues  the agreeableness of her person  her wit  and the   many accomplishments she was mistress of  made her envied and hated    even by those who professed the greatest friendship for her  Several   there were who  though they could scarce support the vexation it gave   them to see her so much preferred to themselves  yet chose to be as much   with her as possible  in the cruel hope of finding some fresh manner   wherewith to blast her reputation       Certain it is  that though she was as far removed as innocence itself   from all intent or wish of committing a real ill  yet she paid too   little regard to the appearances of it  and said and did many things   which the actually criminal would be more cautious to avoid  Hurried by   an excess of vanity  and that love of pleasure so natural to youth  she   indulged herself in liberties  of which she foresaw not the   consequences       Lady Trusty  who sincerely loved her  both for her own sake  and that of   her deceased mother  came more often to Mr  Goodman s than otherwise she   would have done  on purpose to observe the behaviour of Miss Betsy  she   had heard some accounts  which gave her great dissatisfaction  but  as   she was a woman of penetration  she easily perceived  that plain reproof   was not the way to prevail on her to reclaim the errors of her conduct    that she must be insensibly weaned from what at present she took so much   delight in  and brought into a different manner of living  by ways which   should rather seem to flatter than check her vanity  She therefore   earnestly wished to get her down with her into L    e  where she was   soon going herself  but knew not how to ask her without making the same   invitation to Miss Flora  whose company she no way desired  and whose   example  she was sensible  had very much contributed to give Miss Betsy   that air of levity  which rendered her good sense almost useless to her       This worthy lady happening to find her alone one day   a thing not very   usual  she asked  by way of sounding her inclination  if she would not   be glad to see L    e again  to which she replied  that there were many   people for whom she had a very great respect  but the journey was too   long to be taken merely on the score of making a short visit  for she   owned she did not like the country well enough to continue in it for any   length of time       Lady Trusty would fain have persuaded her into a better opinion of the   place she was born in  and which most of her family had passed the   greatest part of their lives in  but Miss Betsy was not to be argued   into any tolerable ideas of it  and plainly told her ladyship  that what   she called a happy tranquil manner of spending one s days  seemed to her   little better than being buried alive       From declaring her aversion to a country life  she ran into such   extravagant encomiums on those various amusements which London every day   presented  that Lady Trusty perceived it would not be without great   difficulty she would be brought to a more just way of thinking  she   concealed  however  as much as possible  the concern it gave her to hear   her express herself in this manner  contenting herself with saying    calmly  that London was indeed a very agreeable place to live in    especially for young people  and the pleasures it afforded were very   elegant   But then   said she   the too frequent repetition of
