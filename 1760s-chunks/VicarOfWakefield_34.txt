grief you know is dry  let us have a bottle of the best gooseberry wine  to keep up our spirits  I have wept so much at all sorts of elegies of late  that without an enlivening glass I am sure this will overcome me  and Sophy  love  take your guitar  and thrum in with the boy a little      Page  175  An ELEGY on the Death of a Mad Dog   GOOD people all  of every sort   Give ear unto my song   And if you find it wond rous short   It cannot hold you long   In Isling town there was a man   Of whom the world might say   That still a godly race he ran   Whene er he went to pray   A kind and gentle heart he had   To comfort friends and foes   The naked every day he clad   When he put on his cloaths   And in that town a dog was found   As many dogs there be   Both mungrel  puppy  whelp  and hound   And curs of low degree   This dog and man at first were friends   But when a pique began   Page  176  The dog  to gain his private ends   Went mad and bit the man   Around from all the neighbouring streets   The wondering neighbours ran   And swore the dog had lost his wits   To bite so good a man   The wound it seem d both sore and sad   To every christian eye   And while they swore the dog was mad   They swore the man would die   But soon a wonder came to light   That shew d the rogues they lied   The man recovered of the bite   The dog it was that dy d      A very good boy  Bill  upon my word  and an elegy that may truly be called tragical  Come  my children  here s Bill s health  and may he one day be a bishop         With all my heart    cried my wife    and if he but preaches as well as he  Page  177  sings  I make no doubt of him  The most of his family  by the mother s side  could sing a good song  it was a common saying in our country  that the family of the Blenkinsops could never look strait before them  nor the Hugginses blow out a candle  that there were none of the Grograms but could sing a song  or of the Marjorams but could tell a story    —   However that be    cried I    the most vulgar ballad of them all generally pleases me better than the fine modern odes  and things that petrify us in a single stanza  productions that we at once detest and praise  Put the glass to your brother  Moses  The great fault of these elegists is  that they are in despair for griefs that give the sensible part of mankind very little pain  A lady loses her lap dog  and so the silly poet runs home to versify the disaster         That may be the mode    cried Moses    in sublimer compositions  but the Ranelagh  Page  178  songs that come down to us are perfectly familiar  and all cast in the same mold  Colin meets Dolly  and they hold a dialogue together  he gives her a fairing to put in her hair  and she presents him with a nosegay  and then they go together to church  where they give good advice to young nymphs and swains to get married as fast as they can         And very good advice too    cried I    and I am told there is not a place in the world where advice can be given with so much propriety as there  for  as it persuades us to marry  it also furnishes us with a wife  and surely that must be an excellent market  my boy  where we are told what we want  and supplied with it when wanting         Yes  Sir    returned Moses    and I know but of two such markets for wives in Europe  Ranelagh in England  and Fontarabia in Spain  The Spanish markept  Page  179  is open once a year  but our English wives are saleable every night         You are right  my boy    cried his mother    Old England is the only place in the world for husbands to get wives    —   And for wives to manage their husbands    interrupted I    It is a proverb abroad  that if a bridge were built across the sea  all the ladies of the Continent would come over to take pattern from ours  for there are no such wives in Europe as our own        But let us have one bottle more  Deborah  my life  and Moses give
