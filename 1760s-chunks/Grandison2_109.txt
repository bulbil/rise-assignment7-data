dear Charlotte  answer me  Have you had less liking to Captain Anderson since your fortune is ascertained  and absolutely in your own power  than you had before     272Miss  Gr  Not on that account  if I know my heart  But he has been a much more earnest suiter since your goodness to me was generally known  than before When public report had made me absolutely dependent on my brother  and diminished  beyond the truth  as it has proved  the circumstances of the family  and when my sister and I were unhappy between our fears and our hopes  I then heard but little from Captain Anderson  and that little was so prudent  and so cold—But I had found out the man before   Lord and Lady L  with warmth of voice  called him unworthy man  I thought him so  and so  by his looks  did Dr  Bartlett   Sir  Ch  Poor man —He seems to have been too prudent  to trust even to providence  But what  my sister  are now your difficulties   Miss Gr  They proceed from my folly  Captain Anderson appeared to me at first  a man of sense  as well as an agreeable man in his person and air  He had a lively and easy elocution  He spoke without doubt  and I had therefore the less doubt of his understanding  The man who knows how to say agreeable things to a woman  in an agreeable manner  has her vanity on his side  since  to doubt his veracity  would be to question her own merit  When he came to write  my judgment was even still more engaged in his favour than before  But when he thought himself on a safe footing with me  he then lost his handwriting  and his stile  and even his orthography  I blush to say it  and I then blushed to see it   Sir Ch  Men will be men  It is natural for us  when we find out our imperfections  to endeavour to supply them  or to gloss them over to those  whose good opinion of us we wish to engage  I have known men who are not so ready as the Captain seems to have been  to find out their own defects  Captain Anderson  perhaps  lost his letter writer  by   273 the shifting of quarters  But it is strange that a man of family  as the Captain is  should be so very illiterate   Miss Gr  His early wildnesses  as I afterwards heard  made him run from school  before he had acquired common school learning  His friends bought him a pair of colours  That was all they would ever do for him  And his father marrying a second wife  by whom he had children  considered not him as one  This came out to be his story  But he displayed himself to me in very different lights  He pretended to have a pretty estate  which  tho  not large  was wellconditioned  and capable of improvement  besides very considerable expectations  A mind that would not impose on another  must least bear to be imposed upon himself  But I could not help despising him  when I found myself so grosly imposed upon  by the letters he had procured to be written for him  and that he was not either the man of sense  or learning  that he would have had me think him   Sir Ch  But what was the safe footing  my sister  that he thought he was upon with you   Miss Gr  O Sir  while all these good appearances held in his favour  he had teazed me into a promise  And when he had gained that point▪ then it was  or soon after  that he wrote to me with his own hand  And yet  tho  he convinced me by doing so  that he had before employed another  it was a point agreed upon  that our intercourse was to be an absolute secret  and I trembled to find myself exposed to his scribe  a man I knew not  and who must certainly despise the lover whom he helped to all his agreeable flourishes  and  in despising him  must probably despise me  Yet I will say  that my letter were such as I can submit to the severest eye  It was indeed giving him encouragement enough  that I answered him by pen and ink  and he presumed enough upon it  or he   274 had never dared to teaze me  for a promise  as he did for months before I made him one   Sir Ch  Women should never be drawn in to fetter themselves by promises  On the contrary  they ought always to despise  and directly to break with the man  who offers to exact a promise from them  To what end is a promise of this kind endeavoured to be obtained  if the urger suspects not the fitness of his addresses in the eyes of those who have a right to be consulted  and if he did not doubt either his own merit  or the lady s honour and discretion —Therefore wanted to put it out of her own power to be dutiful  or  if she had begun to swerve
