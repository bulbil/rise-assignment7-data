seized the unhappy Lord unprepared for  resistance  In vain did he enquire the cause  and endeavour to  expostulate  they sternly commanded him to attend their pleasure  and  hurrying him precipitately away  directed their course towards the  castle of Poictiers  filled with the delightful idea of those rewards  they were to receive for a service so important  Their victim attended  them  patient and resigned to their insolence  disdaining all entreaties  and complaints  and was at length conducted into our hall  as a man  indifferent to his fate  and prepared boldly to meet the worst that  oppression could inflict     But here he found a strange and unlooked for reception  and all the  sanguine hopes of his sordid hunters were lost in confusion and  disgrace  Fortunately some followers of Les Roches  who had been made  prisoners  and were examined by my father  distinctly recounted the  events in the Isle of Rhè  and fired his brave spirit with indignation  and contempt for the Count Mal leon  He began to lament the precipitate  and misguided severity with which he had pursued our friend  and to  revere the character of Lord Salisbury  In that moment he received the  account of my flight  with true paternal grief and anxiety  His joy at  my speedy return was equally extravagant  and soon was he informed of  the generosity that restored me to his arms  Alas  these violent and  repeated impressions were too great for his weak and disordered frame   He had long been oppressed by a dangerous malady  which  as it had  inflamed and irritated his spirit to an unusual degree of impatience and  fretful violence  so was it  in return  inflamed and irritated by the  events which this violence had produced  Too late did he lament his  fatal rashness  and utter his ineffectual wishes to make a full  atonement  On the very morning when Les Roches arrived at Poictiers   we were alarmed with the symptoms of his dissolution  and in these arms  did he expire     Too intent on paying the mournful offices of my deceased  parent  I could scarcely give a thought to Les Roches  I had just the  power to issue my command that he should be treated nobly  Thus did he  continue for some time a prisoner  unnoticed  and uncertain of his fate   an interval which we afterwards lamented bitterly  To that we imputed  the loss of Jacqueline  to that  the distresses of Lord William  which  our imaginations represented in the most frightful form  all derived  from my unhappy delay in seeking and offering him protection  At length  the remains of Lord Chauvigny were interred with all solemn rites  befitting his exalted condition  I now became Lord of his power and  domain  and soon found leisure to think on the father of my beloved  Jacqueline  The hinds who had made him my prisoner  and now applied for  their reward  faw me fall at his feet and embrace him  with all the  rapture of affection and reverence  They would gladly have a merit of  preserving and conveying him to my castle  nor should I have denied  their reward  but that their rude insolence had aggravated the  distresses of my friend  I instantly pronounced him free  I vowed to  devote all my influence and power  to make atonement for his unmerited  sufferings  to exert the most zealous efforts of love and friendship to  regain his daughter and to relieve Lord Salisbury  But Les Roches was  indeed re instated in full possession of his lands and castle  but  not  all our most diligent enquiries  not all our vigilance and labour  in  traversing the wildest and most unfrequented parts of our province   could obtain the least information of his daughter  or his friend  so  secretly had Salisbury chosen his retreat  or perhaps he was then  contending with storms and waves  perhaps securely landed on his own  native shore  This last thought was pleasing  and we were inclined to  indulge it — Thus while my breast was filled with all the impatience of  love  and paternal fondness equally predominant in Les Roches  we soon  concurred in the adventurous resolution of seeking the dear treasure in  England  which fortune had so unkindly torn from  us  Thither  said we  hath Jacqueline been conducted by her noble  protector  and there shall we find both utterly despairing to regain Les  Roches  Inflamed with such hopes  we instantly prepared our retinue  a  gay and gallant train  we soon reached the coast  and soon were we  embarked  alas  too soon  little suspecting the severe reverse of  fortune  that now threatned to confound all our flattering  expectations —The sea was rough and stormy  our bark stout and amply  furnished  but our mariners were unskilful  and long time did we contend  with all the violence of the winds  and long time were we driven from  our destined course  And  when at last  after various dangers and  difficulties  we were cheared with the hopes of speedily gaining the  English coast  suddenly we found
