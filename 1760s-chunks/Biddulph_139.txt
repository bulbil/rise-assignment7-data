bed side  My dear  said she  Mr Downs is unluckily from home  his assistant is sick in bed  and we cannot tonight get any other clergyman to visit you  but as you are desirous of offering up your prayers to Almighty God  I hope it will not be improper if I read the service for the sick by you  He stretched out his hand towards her  and said  in a faint  yet eager voice  Do  do  my good angel  Tears stood in the lady’s eyes as she turned from him  but she quickly wiped them off  and requested of me and the apothecary to join with her in the solemn office she was going to perform  which she said  though she was sensible it was an irregular act  yet she hoped  from the necessity of the case  would be accepted in the sight of God   She ordered my sister to fetch her a prayer book  and then kneeled down at Mr Arnold’s bed side   Surely nothing ever appeared so graceful  her fine hands and her fine eyes lifted up to heaven  while the book lay open before her on a little table  Such a reverential  such an ardent  yet such a mournful supplication in those fine eyes  She looked like something more than human  After having in this posture offered up a short petition in silence  she began the service     Never did I see true devotion before  the fervor of her looks  and the tone of her voice was such  you would have thought she beheld her Creator with her bodily eyes  For my part  I looked on her with such reverence  that she appeared to me like an angel  interceding for us poor mortal sinners   She went through the office with admirable strength of mind  omitting the exhortation  ’till she came to that part of the prayer  which says  ‘yet for as much as in all appearance the time of his dissolution draweth nigh   c’  Here her voice faultered  and she stopped  but soon recovered herself  and proceeded with an unbroken tone to the end  Every one present wept but herself  She thanked us for our kindness in staying  and begged we would continue by poor Mr Arnold  while there was the least possibility of administering any relief to him   I told her I would most willingly obey her commands  and sit up all the night with him  though it was not in human power to give him any assistance   She repeated her thanks  and then sitting down by the bed side  remained composed and silent   About twelve o’clock  finding Mr Arnold speechless  I entreated her to retire to her own chamber  and if she could not sleep  to take some little refreshment  for she had taken nothing that whole day  nor for the two preceding ones  but a dish of tea which my sister had forced on her   Mr Main  said she  suffer me to continue a little longer  my task will soon be over  I was unwilling to urge her  and she remained sitting in her place   About two o’clock  we heard Mr Arnold give a deep groan  He is gone  said she  and started off her chair  I stepped to his bed side  and found indeed he had breathed his last  She snatched up one of his hands that lay upon the coverlid of the bed  held it for near a minute to her lips  and then  without any audible token of grief  went out of the room   I pray God to support and comfort this excellent woman   Patty in continuation    Amen  Amen —Sure my dear unhappy lady is enough to break one’s heart to see her  I was not able to go on  good madam  and begged of my brother to set down what happened  and he has put it    in better words than I could  My lady shut herself up for the remainder of the night  and would not suffer any one to come near her  it is easy to guess how she spent her time  rest  to be sure  she took none  she could not  if she had been inclined  for there was no bed in the chamber where she locked herself up  In the morning  a lady  who is our neighbour  a worthy good woman  came in her own coach  and took away my lady and the two children  She neither consented nor refused  but seemed to let us do what we would with her  for she said nothing  but suffered the lady and me to lead her down stairs  and put her into the coach  But the sight of the two children  threw her into such an agony  that I thought I should have died on the spot only with seeing her   I have writ again to lady Bidulph  if she is able  to be sure she will come down  but I had rather she would send for my lady  for this is a sorrowful place for her to stay in   May 20  My lady has received a message from her mother  desiring her to come to town directly with the children  She
