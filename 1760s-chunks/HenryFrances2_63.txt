live as usual  except in one Particular  that I go to Bed  and rise  early  If this be my Remedy  it is a very easy one  when absent from you  For what Entertainment shall retain me at Board  or what Pleasure detain me in Bed  when you  my Society and Happiness at both  are distant from me   I here send you my Answer to — s genteel Letter   The Prologue  you sent me  is  in general  very well  has a good Turn and Spirit of Poetry in it  but there is one vile Line  as it has but a simple Meaning in itself  and no Sort of Context with the rest    To greet his Shade this grateful Night we give    A Foe to Folly  but the Friend of Man   is an old Line  I think  it is in Rochester s Poem upon Dorset s Satires  where also is this Line   The best good Man  with the worst natur d Muse   But somewhere  I am sure  I have seen it before     Page  238Adieu  my Master work of Art and Nature  whom no Satire can invest without  nor Adulation can corrupt within  Farewell  while I do so  for our Happiness is one   The Post is come in  and no Letter from you—Unkind   LETTER CCLXXII   I AM not  my dearest Harry  a sufficient Mistress of Language to express the heart felt Pleasure  which your Letters give me  They fill my Mind with such a Kind of Rapture  as arises from reflecting on any extraordinary Benefit  we have received from Providence  It is a Mixture of Praise  Gratitude  and Love  Indeed  every Act of Kindness of your s raises me to the best and truest Devotion  I admire and bless the Greatness and Goodness of that Almighty Being  who formed thee  while my Heart overflows with the most thankful Sense of his unmerited Benevolence  in being graciously pleased to make thee mine   You say  you have enjoyed but one Day at home  since we parted  and I have been but one Day abroad  So we remain equal Debtors to Pleasure  if that Term may be justly applied to any Circumstance  Time  or Place  I meet with  in your Absence   Page  239You have already  I hope  received my Excuse for not writing by Thursday s Post—Unkind — how couldst thou deem me so   I will not  because I cannot  tell you how sincerely I rejoice at hearing you have got the better of your Cholic  I have not had any Return  that signifies  of my Disorder  but am still very lame  and suffer much from the Rheumatism   I think your Letter to — an excessive clever one  It shews  at once  the Man of Sense and Business  but still you say nothing of your own Affairs  and seem more inclined to advise  than engage with him   I hear  Lady — is to be in Town in a few Days  so think it needless to write  I have not any Thing new to acquaint you with  Every Thing and Person are just in the same Situation  you left them   I will send you the Answer to the Essay on Spirit next Post   till then  adieu  my Love   Frances   Page  240  LETTER CCLXXIII   Dear FANNY   I RECEIVED your Letter  and  since you are well once more  observe  that I will never give you Credit for being sick again  and I hope you will never have Discredit for being irregular  to which  believe me  all your Complaints are owing  At the same Time  I disclaim any Compassion from  you too  when I am ill again of my old Disorder  for  from the Discontinuance of it  since I left Town  I am convinced  that early Hours  and supperless Slumbers  are the absolute Cure for it  As truly as that Vice produces Vice  Excesses  being of the same Nature  beget each other  We ought certainly to sit up after Supper  then we shall  as surely  lie a bed in the Morning  and  consequently  a late Breakfast falls too suddenly upon Dinner  then a slight Repast keeps back the natural  Appetite  till Night  when the Irregularity must  of course  begin again  And yet the Cure is easy  for  but any one Excess in this Rotation being omitted  the whole will fall again into it s due Order  as  by stopping any single Point of a Circle  you arrest the whole   Just as I had gone so far  a poor Boy begged at my Door  in the Stile of a poor Scholar  and Page  241 modestly asked for nothing but Paper  It seems  he is orphan d both of Father and Mother  and lives from Cottage to Cottage in the Parish where he was born  The Boy had a good honest Look  and I took him into Thompson s Shop  and bound him Apprentice  I am pleased with the Thought of what charming Surprize it will be To
