pleasing in his person  hardened by travel  and polished by adversity  His disappointment in love  however  had infused an air of melancholy into his conversation  which seemed at intervals to interrupt our mutual satisfaction  I expected that this could find a cure only from time  but fortune  as if willing to load us with her favours  has in a moment repaid every uneasiness with rapture   Two days after his arrival  the man in black with his beautiful niece  came to congratulate us upon this pleasing occasion  but  guess our surprize  when my friend s lovely kinswoman was found to be the very captive my son had rescued from Persia  and who had been wreck d on the Wolga  and was carried by the Russian peasants   235 to the port of Archangel  Were I to hold the pen of a novelist  I might be prolix in describing their feelings  at so unexpected an interview  but you may conceive their joy  without my assistance  words were unable to express their transports  then how can words describe it   When two young persons are sincerely enamoured of each other  nothing can give me such pleasure as seeing them married  whether I know the parties or not  I am happy at thus binding one link more in the universal chain  Nature has  in some measure  formed me for a match maker  and given me a soul to sympathize with every mode of human felicity  I instantly therefore consulted the man in black  whether we might not crown their mutual wishes by marriage  his soul seems formed of similar materials with mine  he instantly gave his consent  and the next day was appointed for the solemnization of their nuptials   All the acquaintances which I had made since my arrival  were present at this gay solemnity  The little beau was constituted master of the ceremonies  and his wife Mrs  Tibbs conducted the entertainment with proper decorum  The man in black and the pawn broker s widow  were very sprightly and tender upon this occasion  The widow was dressed up under the direction of Mrs  Tibbs  and as for her lover  his face was set off by the assistance of a pig tail wig  which was lent by the little beau  to fit him for making love with proper formality  The whole company easily perceived  that it would be a double wedding before all was over  and indeed   236 my friend and the widow seemed to make no secret of their passion  he even called me aside  in order to know my candid opinion  whether I did not think him a little too old to be married  As for my own part  continued he  I know I am going to play the fool  but all my friends will praise my wisdom  and produce me as the very pattern of discretion to others   At dinner  every thing seemed to run on with good humour  harmony  and satisfaction  Every creature in company thought themselves pretty  and every jest was laught at  the man in black sat next his mistress  helped her plate  chimed her glass  and jogging her knees and her elbow  he whispered something arch in her ear  on which she patted his cheek  never was antiquated passion so playful  so harmless  and amusing  as between this reverend couple   The second course was now called for  and among a variety of other Dishes  a fine turkey was placed before the widow  The Europeans  you know  carve as they eat  my friend therefore begged his mistress to help him to a part of the turkey  The widow  pleased with an opportunity of shewing her skill in carving  an art  upon which it seems  she picqued herself  began to cut it up by first taking off the leg  Madam  cries my friend  if I might be permitted to adv•se  I would begin by cutting off the wing  and then the Leg will come off more easily  Sir  replies the widow  give me leave to understand cutting up a fowl  I always begin with the leg  Yes Madam  replies the lover  but if the wing be the most convenient   237 manner  I would begin with the wing  Sir  interrupts the lady  when you have fowls of your own  begin with the wing if you please  but give me leave to take off the leg  I hope I am not to be taught at this time of day  Madam  interrupts he  we are never too old to be instructed  Old  Sir  interrupts the other  who is old  Sir  when I die of age  I know of some that will quake for fear  if the leg does not come off  take the turkey to yourself  Madam  replied the man in black  I don t care a farthing whether the leg or the wing comes off  if you are for the leg first  why you shall have the argument  even though it be as I say  As for the matter of that  cries the widow  I don t care a fig  whether you are for the leg off  or on  and friend  for the future keep your distance  O  replied
