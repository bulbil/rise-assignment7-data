Richard the Third   I am myself alone   Our s is so perfect an Englishman  on both Sides  that he has refused the Irish Teat  because it would not have the Brogue on it s Tongue  If he is to be stiled Pliny  let it be the Younger  for I would rather have him endowed with that Goodness and Benevolence of Heart  which was his Characteristic  than all the Learning and Philosophy of the Uncle   I have been shifting all I can settle my Affairs  so as to make my Journey to —  through —  convenient at this Time  but  whether I can do that or no  be assured I will see my sweet Boy christianized  though I go up in one Stage  to return in the next  You shall hear more from me next Post on this Head  I have sent up a fine Ham and a Head by a Carrier  directed to my Brother   I am so charmed at the proper  becoming Sense and Reasonableness of your not pressing Page  288 me to go up before  nor calling upon me since  on the just Assurance that my own Inclinations would induce me to it as soon as possible  that I am therefore resolved to go Coute qui Coute  tho  I had not determined on it before   Adieu  my Heart s Delight  and my Mind s Comfort   Henry   LETTER CCXCIX   I WAITED in vain last Post in — for a Letter from one of your Secretaries  Now may Kitty s Days be ever Nights  and in those Nights  when she stretches forth her Arms for Joy  may she be disappointed  as I was  when the Post came in  Let her  like me  be   mad with the Idea  and grasp the Wind     I have not half done my Prayer  but have stopped short  hoping this Post  which I have just sent to  may make me some Amends for the Disappointment of the last   The Post is just come in  and has answered my Wish of a Letter from yourself  But I am extremely alarmed at the unfavourable Account you give of yourself and Bab  and this very unnatural Weather happens unlucky for you both   Page  289I answered you already about Bab s Name  which I shall leave entirely to you  I hope your next Letter will contain a better Account of yourself  and poor little ourself  than your former  I would not have the Christening delayed on my Account  and I am sure I need not give your Sense and Prudence a Caution to have it as private as possible  that both the Expence  and Report of it  may be as small as can be  The Ease and Happiness of our three Lives depends upon a proper Discretion about these two Articles  Your Happiness depends upon my Welfare  my Welfare upon your Conduct  and our little Self rest upon both  Now  as you are the first moving Principle in this Chain of Causes and Effects  I am perfectly easy  tho  the Consequences are so choice and estimable   Adieu   my Love   Henry   LETTER CCC   I DECLARE myself a Convert to Fitzosborne s Opinion  and   no longer doubt of the salutary Effects  which are said to have been produced by Words   I am become a recent Instance of their Power  for my dear Harry s kind Letter has wrought a greater Change in Page  290 my Health and Spirits  than could have been effected in the Time by the whole Materia medica  In the Name of our dear little Bab  I return his Duty and Thanks for the Kindness you express towards him  I hope he will live to make his being mine  his smallest Merit to your Tenderness  Though I receive a very exquisite Pleasure from seeing him  I cannot help grudging it to myself   as I should any other  unshared by thee  and wishing he were placed within your View  though I should  by that Means  be debarred of the only Joy  I am capable of tasting in your Absence  Any Increase of my Fondness for your dear little Epitome must be superfluous  and indeed I know nothing that could add to it  but seeing him become as much the Object of your Tenderness  as he is of mine  I flatter myself with thinking the happy Time will come  when it shall be doubtful  which of us loves him best     As I am still very weak  and have not made the least Progress in recovering my Appetite  I should be very glad to get into the Air for a little Time  But I wait your Orders to dispose of myself in the Country  or wherever else you please  All Places are alike to me  I must live somewhere  and I think my having a Lodging out of Town  for a few Weeks  could make but a small Difference in my Expences — But let this be  or not  as you think best   Page  291Adieu  thou dear Dispenser of my present Happiness  and only wished Addition to my Hopes of future Bliss   Frances   LETTER CCCI   My Dearest FANNY
