in vain to argue the tyranny of some husbands  when he could turn upon us the follies of some wives  and that wives and daughters were never more faulty  more undomestic  than at present  and when we were before a judge  that  tho  he could not be absolutely unpolite  would not flatter us  nor spare our foibles   However  if stuck a little with Harriet  that she had given Cause to Sir Charles  in the dispute which she formerly bore a part in  relating to learning and languages  to think her more lively than she ought to be  and had spoken too lightly of languages  She sweetly blushing  like a young wife solicitous for the good opinion of the Beloved of her heart  revived that cause   He spoke very highly in her praise  upon the occasion  owned  that the Letters he had been favoured with the sight of  had given him deeper impressions in her favour  than even her Beauty  Hoped for farther communications  applauded her for her principles  and her inoffensive vivacity—That sweet  that innocent vivacity  and noble frankness of heart  said he    364 taking her hand  which I hope you will never think of restraining   As to the conversation you speak of  proceeded he  I repeat  that I was apprehensive  when I read it  that languages were spoken of in it slightly  and yet  perhaps  I am mistaken  You  my Beauchamp  I think  if my dearest Life will oblige us both by the communication  and chooses to do so  for that must be the condition on which all her goodness to us must be expected  shall be judge between us  You know  better than I  what stories of unexhausted knowledge lie in the works of those great Antients  which suffered in the hands of poor Mr  Walden  You know what the past and present ages have owed  and what all future will owe  to Homer  Aristotle  Virgil  Cicero  You can take in the necessity there is of restraining innovation  and preserving old rules and institutions  and of employing the youth of our Sex  who would otherwise be much worse employed  as we see in those who neglect their studies  in the attainment of languages that can convey to them such lights in every science  Tho  it were to be wished  that morals should take up more of the learner s attention than they generally do  You know  that the truest parts of learning are to be found in the Roman and Greek writers  and you know  that translation  were everything worthy our notice translated  cannot convey those beauties which scholars only can relish  and which learned foreigners  if a man travels  will expect should not have escaped his observation  As to the Ladies  Mrs  Shirley  has admirably observed  that there is a degree of knowledge very compatible with their duties  Condescending excellence  bowing to Mrs  Shirley  and highly becoming them  such as will make them rejoice  and  I will add  improve a man of sense  sweeten his manners  and render him a much more sociable  a much more amiable creature    365 and  of consequence  greatly more happy in himself  than otherwise he would be from books and solitude   Well but  brother  you said just now  that we were only  for pleasantry sake  skimming over the surface of the argument  and that you had enough to say to silence all my opposition  were you to give the subject its due weight  I do assure you  that  to silence all my opposition  you must have a vast deal more to say  than you have said hitherto  and yet you have thrown in some hints which stick with me  tho  you have concluded with some magnificent intimations of superiority over us—Power and right to protect  travel  toil for us  and lay your trophies at our feet  and so forth—Surely  surely  this is diminishing us  and exalting yourselves  by laying us under high obligations to your generosity  Pray  Sir  let us have  if you please  one or two intimation▪ of those weightier arguments  that could  as you fancy  silence your Charlotte s opposition  I say  that we women  were our education the same—You know what I would be at—Your weightier arguments  if you please—or a specimen only on passant   Supposing  my Charlotte  that all human souls are  in themselves  equal  yet the very design of the different machines in which they are inclosed  is to superinduce a temporary difference on their original equality  a difference adapted to the different purposes for which they are designed by Providence in the present transitory state  When those purposes are at an end  this difference will be at an end too  When Sex ceases  inequality of Souls will cease  and women will certainly be on a foot with men  as to intellectuals  in Heaven  There  indeed  will you no longer have Lords over you  neither will you have Admirers  Which  in your present estimate of things  will perhaps balance the account  In the mean time  if you can see any occasions
