behaved like a most rancorous step mother   Though she no longer retained that ridiculous notion of his being an  impostor  she still continued to abhor him  as if she really believed  him to be such  and when any person desired to know the cause of her  surprising dislike  she always lost her temper  and peevishly replied   that she had reasons of her own  which she was not obliged to declare   nay  so much was she infected by this vicious partiality  that she broke  off all commerce with her sister in law and the commodore  because they  favoured the poor child with their countenance and protection   Her malice  however  was frustrated by the love and generosity  of Trunnion  who  having adopted him as his own son  equipped him  accordingly  and carried him and his governor in his own coach to the  place of destination  where they were settled on a very genteel footing   and everything regulated according to their desires   Mrs  Trunnion with great decency at the departure of her nephew  to  whom  with a great many pious advices and injunctions to behave with  submission and reverence towards his tutor  she presented a diamond ring  of small value  and a gold medal  as tokens of her affection and esteem   As for the lieutenant  he accompanied them in the coach  and such was  the friendship he had contracted for Perry  that when the commodore  proposed to return  after having accomplished the intent of his journey   Jack absolutely refused to attend him  and signified his resolution to  stay where he was   Trunnion was the more startled a this declaration  as Hatchway was  become so necessary to him in almost all the purposes of his life  that  he foresaw he should not be able to exist without his company  Not a  little affected with this consideration  he turned his eye ruefully  upon the lieutenant  saying  in a piteous tone   What  leave me at last   Jack  after we have weathered so many hard gales together  D   my limbs   I thought you had been more of an honest heart  I looked upon you as my  foremast  and Tom Pipes as my mizen  now he is carried away  if so be  as you go too  my standing rigging being decayed  d ye see  the first    6 22 15  3 45 PM   squall will bring me by the board  D   ye  if in case I have given  offence  can t you speak above board  and I shall make you amends    Jack  being ashamed to own the true situation of his thoughts  after  some hesitation  answered with perplexity and incoherence   No  d    me  that an t the case neither  to be sure you always used me in an  officer like manner  that I must own  to give the devil his due  as the  saying is  but for all that  this here is the case  I have some thoughts  of going to school myself to learn your Latin lingo  for  as the saying  is  Better late mend than never  and I am informed as how one can get  more for the money here than anywhere else    In vain did Trunnion endeavour to convince him of the folly of going to  school at his years  by representing that the boys would make game of  him  and that he would become a laughing stock to all the world  he  persisted in his resolution to stay  and the commodore was fain to  have recourse to the mediation of Pipes and Perry  who employed their  influence with Jack  and at last prevailed upon him to return to the  garrison  after Trunnion had promised he should be at liberty to visit  them once a month  This stipulation being settled  he and his friend  took leave of the pupil  governor  and attendant  and next morning  set  out for their habitation  which they reached in safety that same night   Such was Hatchway s reluctance to leave Peregrine  that he is said  for  the first time in his life  to have looked misty at parting  certain I  am  that on the road homewards  after a long pause of silence  which the  commodore never dreamt of interrupting  he exclaimed all of a sudden    I ll be d  d if the dog ha nt given me some stuff to make me love him    Indeed  there was something congenial in the disposition of these two  friends  which never failed to manifest itself in the sequel  howsoever  different their education  circumstances  and connections happened to  be   CHAPTER XVI    Peregrine distinguishes himself among his School fellows  exposes his  Tutor  and attracts the particular Notice of the Master   Thus left to the prosecution of his studies  Peregrine was in a  little time a distinguished character  not only for his acuteness of  apprehension  but also for that mischievous fertility of fancy  of which
