completing our week in town  unless Miss Ware came in the interim  I have just told our friend so  said he  he seems to take it unkindly  and says he    is afraid he has disobliged me  but I assured him my only reason was  that I did not think the house of a handsome young batchelor  a proper place for a pretty little country girl  even though her old father was with her  He assures me his sister will come  and wants to protract our stay a few days longer  I hardly know how to refuse his entreaties  but I shall be uneasy till we are at home   I told my father  Mr Ware had too much sense to take his refusal amiss  and begged of him to stick to his day   I gave Mr Ware no opportunity of speaking to me the remainder of that day  nor all the next  though he came to my closet door where I always sat  and entreated for admission  but I was peremptory in my denial  and he went away reproaching me with cruelty   Mr Ware made an apology to my father  on account of his being obliged to spend the evening abroad  the first time that he had been absent from us since we came to his house  He had twice entertained us with a very agreeable concert  at which there was a great deal of company  both gentlemen and ladies  He had got it performed at his own house  on purpose to amuse my father  who was a great lover of music  but excepting those two mornings  I had never seen any company with him  as he said he would not invite strangers  ’till I had got a companion of my own sex to keep me in countenance  My father and I supped alone  we were to go out of town the next day  and we retired to our respective chambers about eleven o’clock  in order to go to bed   The poor girl paused at this part of her story  as if she were ashamed to proceed   I hope  said I  Mr Ware did not violate the laws of hospitality  by intruding on you that night  Oh  Madam  he did  he did  said she  the vile wretch hid himself somewhere  I know not where  for it was not in my closet  The house keeper slept in my room  in a little tent bed  which had been put up for that purpose  but she was not as yet come up stairs  The chamber maid  who had attended me to my room  told me there was to be a great deal of company to dine with her master the next day  and as the house keeper was very busy in making jellies and pastry  she was afraid she should sit up late  and hoped I should not be disturbed at her coming into the room  I always dismissed the maid immediately  as I was not used to have a person undress me  I went to bed  but not being a very sound sleeper  and knowing a particularity I had  which was  that if once rouzed  I could not compose myself to rest again  I resolved not to attempt it at all ’till the    house keeper came to bed  I placed the candle on a stand near me  and took up a book that I found on a chair  by my bed side  which I had been reading in the evening  I had been about an hour thus employed  when I heard somebody treading softly in the room  as I had not heard the door open  I called out  in a fright  to know who was there  I received no answer  but immediately Mr Ware presented himself  on his knees  at my bed side  and half leaning on my bed  I shrieked out  I knew not what he said  but I remember the most wicked of men held me fast  and talked a great deal  I continued shrieking incessantly  and struggling to get loose from him  which at last I did  by giving a violent spring  which threw me out of bed on the floor   I had hurt myself sadly by the fall  but dragging the quilt off the bed after me  I wrapped it about me and shrieked louder than before  The vile man tried to pacify me  and said I should disturb my father   Providentially for me  my dear father had not gone to bed  for his room was a great way from mine  but was reading in the study  which was over my bed chamber  He had heard my shrieks from the first  but  little dreaming it was his poor daughter’s voice  he imagined the noise was in the street  and had lifted up the sash  and looked out to try whence it proceeded  Finding every thing quiet without doors  he ran down stairs  and was led  by my cries  into my room  for my vile persecutor had not locked the door  very well knowing none of his own people could dare to molest him  and he did not think my cries would have reached my father’s ears  as indeed they would not  if he had
