other hand  rebuked with like acrimony the riotous    factious  and seditious propensities of a turbulent  licentious  and   unsatisfied people  ever repugnant to government  and reluctant to   the reign of the gentlest ruler  I proved  from many authorities   and instances  derived from Greece and Rome  that power is never   so dangerous to a populace as when it is taken into their own   hands   that the governors and governed  by the violence of col    lision  are apt to fly to extremes on either side   that anarchy is   the most direct of all roads to tyranny   and that a people  who   have no will to be governed  reduce themselves to the necessity of   being crushed  insulted  and governed  whether they will or no      Now  sir  though I thus alternately sided with the people against   power  and with power against the people  yet I struck at nothing   but faults on either hand  and equally asserted  on both sides of the   question  the causo of my country  of liberty  and tnith          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  89     I took five times the pains with these latter papers that I did   with the former  and yet I confess I had not equal pleasure in the   delivery  I am also persuaded that these had more than double   the merit of the other  and  in point of sentiment  moral and general   instruction  were of twenty times the value to mankind   but how   can that instruct which is not attended to  It was intimated to   the people that these had been written at the instance of their   governors  and they would not have listened to an oracle if   uttered from that quarter      Six months had now elapsed in these lucubrations  I had deli    vered to my wife two hundred and sixty guineas  the weekly price   of my labours  We had lived with great frugality  Arabella had   again taken in as much work as her nursing and attention to the   child would admit  and we had some pieces left of our former   remnant  when Lord Stivers called in upon me  with pleasure and   good news  as it were prologue in his aspect      Mr  Clement  says he  I want to speak to you apart  I had   yesterday some talk with the minister about you  and he has   promised me four hundred a year pension for you till something   better can be done   and this is to be wholly clear and over your   weekly wages of ten guineas  while we keep you so hard at work    But tell me  Clement  says he  laying his hand with an affectionate   familiarity upon my shoulder  are you of a jealous temper  The   furthest from it  my lord  of any man breathing  Oh   I am glad   of that   but  if you were  I have nothing exceptionable to propose    To be short  half a dozen of noblemen  all my friends  and people   of strict probity and virtue  have engaged to spend a share of   to morrow in a party of pleasure upon the Thames   and we have    each of us  laid a bet of a hundred guineas  that from the number   of his relations  his friends  or acquaintance  he will bring the   prettiest woman to this field of contention  I had fixed on Lady   Fanny Standish  a lovely creature  and a relation Oi my own  but   she unfortunately happened to be pre engaged to one of my rivals    I am therefore quite at a loss  and must infallibly lose my wager   if you do not favour me with the company of Mrs  Clement  With   her I can make no question of conquest   and I give you my honour   to pour into her lap the whole five hundred guineas  the just prize   of her beauty      Why  my lord  I answered  this is indeed a very pleasant project    and has nothing in it exceptionable that I can perceive  if no one   was to know any thing of the matter  But what will the world   say to see your lordship so paired  Psha  never heed the world    Clement   I am your world man  Your lordship has a very good   right to scorn an inferior world  I rejoined   but the world has an   equal right  and would certainly make use of it  in the scorning   of my wife  What  said he  warmly  you will not then confide her   to my friendship and honour  I will not  my lord  confide her
