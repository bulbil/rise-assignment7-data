 to end my days in the mansions of devotion  to hear the reverend father  speak comfort to my departing spirit —but  I cannot —this frame is too  feeble  the hand of death presses too severely upon me —O friends  if  ever your hearts knew pity  look upon that boy  He was not born to this  wretchedness  he hath still noble friends —If you would atone to heaven  for your offences  save him  convey him quickly from the power of his  enemies  Seek the place appointed for our retreat  there save yourselves  and him  there shall the friends of his house find him rescued from  cruelty and usurpation  they shall protect and defend him  they shall  assert his rights and reward your fidelity  These jewels  these  treasures shall reward you  My son shall live to reward you         —Elinor  kneeling before her with weeping eyes and lifted hands   earnestly entreated her to collect her spirits and to pursue her  intended flight  uttering the most ardent and passionate vows that fear  or force should never drive her from her beloved mistress — If I am  beloved   said the Countess       shew me thy love  and save my  child  Think not of me  I can die here  and some charitable hand may  perhaps be sound to close my eyes in peace         Here she again fainted  nor could all the tender care and sollicitude  exerted to relieve her  restore her to life and sense  Elinor hung  weeping over her  Oswald was dismayed and distracted  he saw the danger  of this rash enterprize  and could think of no resource  he would have  consulted with his sister  but her mind was engaged only by her  mistress  He suddenly called to his attendant  who still continued at  some distance with the horses  one of these he mounted  the Countess was  raised up and placed reclining in his arms  Thus he proceeded gently  towards a cottage which lay at some small distance  whose charitable  inhabitants rose at the noise of benighted travellers  and admitted  them  The Countess was disposed upon their humble couch  and now once  again recovered from her trance  She thanked the tenderness of the  afflicted Elinor  then calling to Oswald  with hands and eyes raised to  heaven  she earnestly conjured him by all his hopes of future happiness   to fly with her son to sanctuary  to proclaim his and her wrongs  and  particularly to seek the protection of the Lord de Warren his father s  noble friend  who would receive and shield his helpless innocence   assert his rights  and controul his oppressors  Of herself she spake  with indifference  as a person on the point of finding refuge from her  enemies in the arms of death  Oswald was so persuaded  he regarded her  present languid state as the last sad period of her life  and looking  tenderly upon his sister  seemed to wish that she could fly from the  resentment of Lord Raymond  But soon were his thoughts checked by the  zealous declarations of this friendly matron  that no fear of power  no  threats of punishment  no motive whatever should prevail upon her to  abandon her dear mistress  she urged him to obey her commands with  speed  and to leave them to the protection of heaven  The  honest heart of Oswald was affected  in a passionate fit of zeal  he  declared himself ready to fly with young William  The anxious mother  thanked him with her looks  she clasped her son with a feeble but tender  embrace  and lifting her eyes devoutly towards heaven  commended him to  the protection of all the holy angels  His looks confessed his infant  fear  when she delivered him to his conductor  He wept  and was cenveyed  away  Some few tears dropt from the Countess  but the recollection of  his escape  and the hopes of his preservation  soon gave comfort to her  afflicted mind  and animated her with new life and spirit  Her eyes were  lighted up anew  her voice less faltering  and her frame less languid   She now seemed to defy her oppressors  and declared herself resolved to  assume her rightful authority and state  to act as mistress of her  castle and domain  in open defiance of the bold intruders  By the dawn  of morning  some peasants were dispatched to the castle to give notice  of her present situation  and to order such conveniencies as were  necessary for her removal  A litter together with the proper attendants  was soon sent for this purpose  Elinor  still faithful to her charge   waited on the side of her beloved lady  who now again entered her own  stately hall  and was laid with care and tender offices of duty upon her  own couch                  SECT  V     IN the mean time  confusion had spread among the domestics  Morning  discovered the desertion of
