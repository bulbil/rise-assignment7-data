drudgery of three servants without receiving the wages of one   Miss Squeeze was a pawnbroker s daughter  her father had early taught her that money was a very good thing  and left her a moderate fortune at his death  She was so perfectly sensible of the value of what she had got  that she was resolved never to part with a farthing without an equality on the part of her suitor  she thus refused several offers made her by people who wanted to better themselves  as the saying is  and grew old and ill natured  without ever considering that she should have made an abatement in her pretensions  from her face being pale  and marked with the small pox   Lady Betty Tempest on the contrary had beauty  with fortune and family  But  fond of conquest  she passed from triumph to triumph  she had read plays and romances  and there had learned that a plain man of common sense was no better than a fool  such she refused  and sighed only for the gay  giddy  inconstant and thoughtless  after she had thus rejected hundreds who liked her  and sighed for hundreds who despised   115 her  she found herself insensibly deserted  at present she is company only for her aunts and cousins  and sometimes makes one in a country dance  with only one of the chairs for a partner  casts off round a joint stool  and sets to a corner cupboard  In a word  she is treated with civil contempt from every quarter  and placed  like a piece of old fashioned lumber  merely to fill up a corner   But Sophronia  the sagacious Sophronia  how shall I mention her  She was taught to love Greek  and hate the men from her very infancy  she has rejected fine gentlemen because they were not pedants  and pedants because they were not fine gentlemen  her exquisite sensibility has taught her to discover every fault in every lover  and her inflexible justice has prevented her pardoning them  thus she rejected several offers  till the wrinkles of age had overtaken her  and now  without one good feature in her face  she talks incessantly of the beauties of the mind   Farewell   LETTER XXVIII  From the same   WERE we to estimate the learning of the English by the number of books that are every day published among them  perhaps no country  not even China itself  could equal them in this particular  I have reckoned not less than twenty three new books published in one day  which upon computation  makes eight thousand   116 three hundred and ninety five in one year  Most of these are not confined to one single science  but embrace the whole circle  History  politics  poetry  mathematics  metaphysics  and the philosophy of nature are all comprized in a manual not larger than that in which our children are taught the letters  If then we suppose the learned of England to read but an eighth part of the works which daily come from the press  and sure none can pretend to learning upon less easy terms  at this rate every scholar will read a thousand books in one year  From such a calculation you may conjecture what an amazing fund of literature a man must be possessed of  who thus reads three new books every day  not one of which but contains all the good things that ever were said or written   And yet I know not how it happens  but the English are not in reality so learned as would seem from this calculation  We meet but few who know all arts and sciences to perfection  whether it is that the generality are incapable of such extensive knowledge  or that the authors of those books are not adequate instructors  In China  the emperor himself takes cognisance of all the doctors in the kingdom who profess authorship  In England  every man may be an author that can write  for they have by law a liberty not only of saying what they please  but of being also as dull as they please   Yesterday  I testified my surprize to the man in black  where writers could be found in sufficient number to throw off the books I daily saw crowding from the press  I at first imagined  that their learned seminaries might take this   117 method of instructing the world  But to obviate this objection  my companion assured me  that the doctors of colleges never wrote  and that some of them had actually forgot their reading  but if you desire  continued he  to see a collection of authors  I fancy I can introduce you this evening to a club  which assembles every Saturday at seven  at the sign of the Broom near Islington  to talk over the business of the last  and the entertainment of the week ensuing  I accepted his invitation  we walked together  and entered the house some time before the usual hour for the company assembling   My friend took this opportunity of letting me into the characters of the principal members of the club  not even the host excepted  who  it seems  was once an author himself  but preferred by a bookseller to this situation as a reward for his former services   The first person  said he  of our society  is
