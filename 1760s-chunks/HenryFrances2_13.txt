Authority  The Belief of this Matter is Page  47 a Thing above our Reason  but not contrary to it  which is the proper Definition of Faith  And  if it were made an Article of our Creed  I do not think it would be amiss  for it is not contrary to Religion  as being vouched by Holy Writ  At least  I would not discourage the Belief  since it is a strong Proof of Life  after Death  which every Argument that tends to prove  adds Strength to Religion and Virtue  As to the Immortality of the Soul  which I lay hold of every Opportunity to discourse upon  it is a Thing  which a Christian cannot doubt of  because there is express Authority for it in that Book  upon which his Faith is founded  And even to a Deist it may be proved  ex absurbo  which is a Method of arguing in the Mathematics  when the Truth of a Proposition cannot be demonstrated in a direct Manner  the Assent is gained  by shewing the Absurdity of the contrary Opinion  As thus  If there be no Hereafter for Mankind  God is inconsistent  and unjust  the first  in giving us Hopes  which we certainly have from the Light of Nature alone  that are never to be fulfilled  and the second  in suffering Virtue  in any Shape  to go unrewarded  That Being  then  which is inconsistent  or unjust  cannot be God  ergo  a Mortalist Deist sinks into an Atheist  I would treat an Atheist after the same Manner that I mentioned just now  and brand him with that Page  48 pupil Ensign  which is the proper Emblem of his extreme Ignorance  for  as the Psalmist justly expresses it    The Fool hath said in his Heart  there is no God     Orrery  in the Notes upon the twenty eighth Epistle  says  this Letter should be placed the first of the whole Collection  and he is certainly right  Proper Lights  and particular Points of View  are a great Advantage to every thing  He often complains of the Want of Order through the Whole  and I am angry at him  for not setting this Matter right  for it would be as little Trouble  as the Observing upon it  I have a Mind to do so myself  when I have finished the Reading   I am pleased with Pliny s Sentiment upon Ridicule  in the last Paragraph of the twenty ninth Epistle  And I approve of it as an admirable Weapon against Vice  and surely fitter here employed  than  as Shaftsbury recommends it  for the Test of Truth  Almost any Man would rather undergo Fine  Imprisonment  or Pain itself  rather than the Mortification of being laughed at  Addison  and other ingenious Writers  have spoken so admirably upon the Power of Shame  or Influence of Modesty  that  for very Shame  I shall not attempt to pursue the Subject in this Light  but shall take the Liberty  for the Honour of human Nature  to Page  49 consider this Matter in a particular Manner  which I never met with  in any Author   Speech is not the distinguishing Sign of an human Creature  for Birds have been taught to speak  Nay  all the Brute  or Animal Creation converse naturally  for their Tones are intelligible to each other  and what are Words  but Sounds  and Expressions of our Ideas  Rationality is not the proper Sign neither  for Instinct makes that Matter doubtful  and it is certain  that all Animals act logically  Risibility is a Mark much insisted upon  but  if this is meant merely of a Distortion of Countenance  I have seen Dogs laugh  and if it be meant as a Sign of Chearfulness  or Pleasure  then the various Expressions of these Sensations  throughout the whole Brute World  sufficiently answer to this Definition  I look upon Modesty  then  to be the only Characteristic  or Criterion  which properly distinguishes Man from other Animals  as we are certainly the only Creatures known  who have the least Sense of Shame   I am   my fair Inspirer   Your Oracle  Henry   Page  50  LETTER CXCVI  HENRY to FRANCES   I SENT a second Messenger to the Post  suspecting the first had deceived me  but not a Line from you  though you must know how anxious I am  at present  to learn some Particulars relating to your Situation  Well  I am angry now — but A  B  C   c  and now kiss  and Friends  and you are my own spoiled Pet again  But  if I do not hear from you by Tomorrow  I must eke out the Roman Alphabet with the Greek and Hebrew  I sent to know  if Kitty had any Account of you  but received no Satisfaction from thence   But to return to Pliny  I think Orrery too severe upon the second Epistle of the eighth Book  not considering it as wrote to a Friend  and not to the World  The Privilege of Friendship is  to think aloud  And shall I be reprimanded for communicating to my dearest Fanny my humane Sentiments  with Regard to
