Greville  The dear soul  I am afraid  is fallen into even worse hands than his   I went to Sir Hargrave s house  He was not at home  He was at home  He had company with him  He was not to be spoken with  These were the different answers given me by his porter  with as much confusion  as I had impatience  and yet it was evident to me  that he had his lesson given him  In short  I have reason to think  that Sir Hargrave came not home all night  The man in the cloak  I doubt  was he  Now does all that Sir John Allestree said of the malicious wickedness of this devilish man  and his arrogant behaviour to our dear Miss Byron  on her rejecting him  come fresh into my memory  And is she  can she be  fallen into the power of such a man —Rather  much rather  may my first surmises prove true  Greville is surely  exceptionable as he is  a better man  at least  a better natured man  than this  and he can have no thoughts less honourable than marriage  But this villian  if he be the villian—I cannot  I dare not pursue the thought   THE four chairmen are just returned  They think they have found the place  but having gained some intelligence  intelligence which distracts me   they hurried back for directions   They had asked a neighbouring alehouse keeper  if there were not a long garden  belonging to the house they suspected  and a back door out of it to a dirty lane and fields  He answered in the affirmative  The front of this house faces the road     176 They called for some hot liquors  and asked the landlord after the owners  He knew nothing of harm of them  he said  They had lived there near a twelvemonth in reputation  The family consisted of a widow  whose name is Awberry  her son and two daughters  The son  a man of about thirty years of age  has a place in the Custom house  and only came down on a Saturday  and went up on Monday  But an odd circumstance  he said  had alarmed him that very morning   He was at first a little shy of telling what it was  He loved  he said  to mind his own business  What other people did was nothing to him  But  at last  he told them  that about six o clock in the morning he was awaken d by the trampling of horses  and looking out of his window  saw a chariot and six  and three or four men on horseback at the widow Awberry s door  He got up  The footmen and coachmen were very hush  not calling for a drop of liquor  tho  his doors were open  A rare instance  he said  where there were so many men servants together  and a coachman one of them  This  he said  could not but give a greater edge to his curiosity   About seven o clock  one of the widow s daughters came to the door  with a lighted candle in her hand  and directed the chariot to drive up close to the house  The alehouse keeper then slipt into an arbour like porch  next door to the widow s  where he had not been three minutes before he saw two persons come to the door  the one a tall gentleman in laced cloaths  who had his arms about the other  a person of middling stature  wrapt up in a scarlet cloak  and resisting  as one in great distress  the other s violence  and begging not to be put into the chariot  in a voice and accent  that evidently shewed it was a woman   The gentleman made vehement protestations of honour  but lifted the Lady into the chariot  She struggled  and seemed to be in agonies of grief  and   177 on being lifted in  and the gentleman going in after her  she screamed out for help  and he observed in the struggling  that she had on  under her cloak  a silverlaced habit  The Masquerade habit  no doubt   Her screaming grew fainter and fainter  and her voice sounded to him  as if her mouth were stopped  And the gentleman seemed to speak high  as if he threatened her   Away drove the chariot  The servants rode after it   In about half an hour  a coach and four came to the widow s door  the widow and her two daughters went into it  and it took the same road   The alehouse keeper had afterwards the curiosity to ask the maid servant  an ignorant country wench  whither her mistresses went so early in the morning  She answered they were gone to Windsor  or that way  and would not return  she believed  in a week   O this damn d Sir Hargrave  He has a house upon the forest  I have no doubt but he is the villain  Who knows what injuries the dear creature might have sustained before she was forced into the chariot —God give me patience  Dear soul  Her prayers  Her struggling  Her crying
