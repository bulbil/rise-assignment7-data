 by name Antony Dagley  no doubt has managed this affair for her   Mrs  Beaumont now recollects several circumstances  which  could she have suspected Clementina to be capable of such an enterprize  might have given her suspicion   The vessel she is in  is called The Scanderoon  Alexander Henderson master   How can the dear creature on her arrival in England look You  your Lady  your Sisters  in the face  What may she suffer  in such a voyage  at such a season  To what insults may she be exposed  So little as she knows of the English tongue  Laura not a syllable of it  Depending on the fidelity of a stranger boy  So few changes of apparel as she had the opportunity to take with her —Whether provided with any considerable sums of money  we know not  England  in her opinion  a nation of   101 heretics —Good Heaven  could Clementina della Porretta be guilty of such a rashness   But what an averseness must she have to marriage  We have certainly been too precipitating  You cautioned us  Yet  I dare say  could not have believed  that our Clementina could have taken such a step  But  alas  we conclude  that it is owing more to the effects of her late unhappy malady  than to any other cause  When once the mind is disordered  there is danger  it seems  of its shewing itself  on extraordinary occasions  even after the cure is supposed to be perfected  capable of extravagance  Again I say  we have been too hasty —Our brother Giacomo —But he is the most disinterested of men  He would not otherwise be so urgent as he is for her marriage   Dear  dear creature  How my heart bleeds for the distresses she may be thrown into —But they cannot be equal to those which her mother feels for her  Clementina knows how much the lives of her father and mother are bound up in hers  But I repeat  she must be under the influences of her former malady  or never  never  could she have done an act  that she must know would wound our very souls   From the lights I have held out  we hope you will be able to find her before she can have suffered more than the inconveniencies of the voyage  before she can have wanted money  or other conveniencies  If you do  your sisters will give the rash one countenance and protection till we can arrive   Our company will be  my Father  Mother  the Bishop  your Jeronymo  Father Marescotti  and our two cousins Sebastiano and Juliano  Mrs  Beaumont has the goodness  purely from motives of charity  to accompany my mother  Poor Camilla  almost as inconsolable as my mother  attends her Lady   We must give you the trouble of hiring for us as large a house as you can procure  The circumstances   102 we are in  allow us not to think of any thing more than common convenience  and to be incognito   Our two cousins above named may be in lodgings  if room be wanted   We shall have no more than necessary attendants   A lesser house  or handsome lodgings will content the Count of Belvedere   These cares for us  my dear Grandison  we must throw upon you  Yet  if my Lowther be in England  he will be so kind as to ease you of part of them  You will have concern enough in sharing ours  for the occasion which carries us to you  so much sooner than we intended  and in an inconvenient season  circumstances that will sufficiently demonstrate the distress we are in   The vessel we have hired  is called  The Leghorn Frigate  The master s name is Arthur Gunning  If we are favoured in our voyage  the master hopes to be in your river Thames in about three weeks from our embarking   God give us  my Grandison  a meeting not unhappy  May we find the dear fugitive safe in your protection  or under the wings of one of your noble sisters   I hope this unhappy affair will produce no uneasiness between your Lady and you  If it should  what an additional evil would the dear rash one have to answer for   The General is too much incensed against the unhappy girl  to think of accompanying us  could he obtain permission of his sovereign   The least reparation the dear creature can make us  the Bishop says  is  chearfully to give her vows to the good Count of Belvedere  who looks forward to the issue of this affair  as the crisis of his fate   I hardly know what I have written  nor how to leave off  It is to you  our dear friend  our consoler  our brother  and  let me add  our refuge  next to   103 that Almighty  who we hope will guide us in safety to you  and give an issue not greatly derogatory to the glory of our sister  and family  Join  my Grandison  your prayers with ours  to this purpose  Noblest of friends  Adieu   JERONYMO della PORRETTA   LETTER XVIII  Lady GRANDISON  To Ladies
