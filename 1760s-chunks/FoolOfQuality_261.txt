These writs  however  did not ennoble the party till   he was admitted by the second estate to a seat in parliament    neither was such nobility by writ hereditary      To supply these defects  the arbitrary ministry of Kichard II    invented the method of ennobling by letters patent at the king s   pleasure  whether for years or for life  or in special or general tail    or in fee simple to a man and his heirs at large  This prerogative    however  was thereafter in many instances declined and discon    tinued  more particularly by the constitutional king Harry the Fifth    till  meeting with no opposition from the other two estates  it has   successively descended  from Harry VII   on nine crowned heads    through a prescription of near a century and a half      Next to the king  the people have allowed to their peerage   several privileges of the most uncommon and illustrious distinction    Their Christian names  and the names that descended to them   from their ancestors  are absorbed by the name from whence they   take their title of honour  and by this they make their signature         278 TEE FOOL OF QUALITY      in all letters and deeds  Every temporal peer of the realm is   deemed a kinsman to the crown  Their deposition on their honour   is admitted in place of their oath  save where they personally   present themselves as witnesses of the facts  and saving their oaths   of allegiance  supremacy  and abjuration  Their persons are at all   times exempted from arrests  except in criminal cases  A defama    tion of their character is highly punishable  however true the facts   may be  and deserving of censure  During session of parliament    all actions and suits at law against peers are suspended  In pre    sentments or indictments by grand juries  and on impeachments   by the house of commons  peers are to be tried by their peers   alone   for in all criminal cases they are privileged from the juris    diction of inferior courts  excepting on appeals for murder or   robbery  Peers are also exempted from serving on inquests  And   in all civil cases  where a peer is plaintiff  there must be two or   more knights impannelled on the jury      The bishops  or spiritual lords  have privilege of parliament  but   have not the above privileges of personal nobility  In all criminal   cases  saving attainder and impeachment  they are to be tried by a   petit jury  Moreover  bishops do not vote  in the house of lords  on   the trial of any person for a capital crime      All the temporal and spiritual nobles that compose the house of   lords  however different in their titles and degrees of nobility  are   called peers  pares   or equals   because their voices are admitted   as of equal value  and that the vote of a bishop or baron shall be   equivalent to that of an archbishop or duke      The capital privilege  or rather prerogative  of the house of peers   consists in their being the supreme court of judicature  to whom   the final decision of all civil causes are confided and referred in   the last resort      This constitutional privilege is a weighty counterpoise to his   majesty s second prerogative of appointing the administrators of   justice throughout the nation   forasmuch as judges  who are im    mediately under the influence of the crown  are yet intimidated   from infringing  by any sentence  on the laws or constitution of these   realms  while a judgment so highly superior to their own impends      The second great privilege of the house of peers consists in their   having the sole judicature of all impeachments commenced and pro    secuted by the commons  And this  again  is a very weighty coun    terpoise to his majesty s third prerogative of the executive govern    ment of these nations by his ministers   since no minister can be so   great as not justly to dread the coming under a judgment from   which the mightiness of his royal master cannot protect him      The third capital privilege of the house of peers subsists in their   share  or particular department of rights  in the legislature  This ex    tends to the framing of any bills  at their pleasure  for the purposes   of good government   saving always to the commons their incom    municable right of granting taxes or subsidies to be levied on   their constituents  But on such bills  as on all others  the house of   lords have a negative a happy counterpoise to the power both of   king and commons
