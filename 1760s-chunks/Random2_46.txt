appetite  and he sat silent  unable to swallow one mouthful  while his tormentor enjoyed his mortification  and encreased his chagrin  by advising him to lay in plentifully for his next day s fast     Dinner being ended  we came down stairs to the coffee room  and Banter went away to keep an appointment  saying  he supposed he should see Wagtail and me in the evening at the Bedford coffee house —He was no sooner gone  than the old gentleman took me aside  and said  he was sorry to see me so intimate with that fellow who was one of the most graceless rakes about town  and had already wasted a good estate and constitution upon harlots —that he had been the ruin of many a young man  by introducing them into debauched company  and setting a lewd example of all manner of wickedness  and that  unless I was on my guard  he would strip me in a short time  both of my money and reputation  I thanked him for his information  and promised to conduct myself accordingly  wishing however  his caution had been a few hours   131 more early  by which means I might have saved five guineas  Notwithstanding this intelligence  I was inclinable to impute some part of the charge to Medlar s revenge for the liberties taken with him at dinner  and therefore  as soon as I could disengage myself  applied to Wagtail for his opinion of the character in question  resolved to compare their accounts  allowing for the prejudice of each  and form my judgment upon both  without adhering strictly to either —The doctor assured me that he was a very pretty gentleman  of family and fortune  a scholar  a wit  a critick  and perfectly well acquainted with the town  that his honour and courage were unquestionable  though some extravagancies he had been guilty of  and his talent for satire  had procured him enemies  and made some people shy of his acquaintance —From these different sketches  I concluded that Banter was a young fellow of some parts  who had spent his fortune  but retaine I his appetites  and fallen out with the world because he could not enjoy it to his wish   I went to the Bedford coffee house in the evening  where I met my friends  from thence proceeded to the play  and afterwards carried them home to my lodgings  where we supped with great harmony and satisfaction     132  CHAP  XLIX    I receive a challenge—the consequences of it—the quarrel being made up  I am put in arrest  by the care and affection of Strap—but immediately released upon explaining my affair—the behaviour of Mr  Oregan and his two friends—I visit Melinda  whom I divert with an account of the duel—I propose marriage—she refers the matter to her mother  of whom I make a solemn demand of her daughter—the old lady s behaviour—I am discarded  resent their disdain   WHEN I was ready to go abroad next day  Strap brought me a letter  directed To Mr  Random  Esq Those —Which  upon opening  I found contained a challenge  couched in these very extraordinary terms   SIR   WHereas  I am informed that you make love to Miss Melinda Goosetrap  This is to let you know  that she is under promise of marriage to me  and that I am at this present writing  at the back of Montaguehouse  with a pair of good pistols in my hand  and if you will keep your appointment  I will make your tongue confess  after the   133 breath is out of your body  that you do not deserve her as well as  Yours   c  Rourk Oregan   I guessed from the stile and subscription of this billet  that my rival was a true Milesian  and was not a little uneasy at the contents  especially that part  where he asserts his right to my mistress by promise  a circumstance I did not know how to reconcile to her penetration —However  this was no time for me to decline the invitation  because the success of my addresses might in a great measure depend upon my behaviour in that affair  I therefore immediately loaded my pistols  and betook myself in a hackney coach to the place appointed  where I found a tall raw boned man  with a hard featured countenance  and black bushy beard  walking by himself  wrapped up in a shabby great coat  over which his own hair descended in a leathern queue from his head  that was covered with a greasy hat trimmed with a tarnished pointe d espagne  He no sooner perceived me advancing  than without any preamble  he pulled a pistol from his bosom  and presenting at me  snapt it  Alarmed at this rude salutation  I made a stand  and before he could adjust his other piece  fired one of mine at him  without doing any damage  By this time he was ready with his second  that flashed in the pan without going off  Upon which he called  with a true Tipperary cadence     Fire away  honey  —  and began to hammer his flint with great dedeliberation —But   134 I was resolved to make use of the advantage Fortune had given me  and therefore stept up  without
