at — for a Fortnight  which Time was not elapsed  before he had my last Letter  yet  perhaps  he did not stay as long as he designed  and might have gone home  before I had finished my Essay  This may account for the Delay of hearing from him  Or  perhaps  he has taken Time to consider  and consult some Friends about it  But  as I said in a former Letter on this Head  I was so prepared  as not to suffer any Disappointment  from the very first of my Application to him  so shall trouble myself no more about the Matter  unless I hear from him again  and then it shall be as a new Affair to me   You have renewed a Subject  which we have had frequent Disputes about  that my Sense is better than your s  but your Love greater than mine  Now I shall still argue both these Points with you  and the latter  I hope  I shall make  at least  doubtful  during our Lives  If I have a stronger Sense  you have a prettier one  and  if I appear to have any Advantage over you  in the Humility of your Opinion only  it is more owing to the Fortitude of my Mind  than the Excellence of my Understanding  As to the second Point  it is out of Debate  as you seem to have given it up  by the first  for Page  246 a Man must love you in Proportion to his Understanding   I did not mean to scold  but warn my Pet  when I hinted at Irregularities  which  I apprehended  was the Occasion of the heavy Cold  you complained of  What I meant was sitting up  and lying in Bed  late  both of which are very bad  in a double Sense  at present  But I am quite easy  since you have promised to conform to the Rules  I shall prescribe to you  As you likewise know my Sentiments already  I need not repeat them  for I have that Confidence in you  that you will strictly govern yourself by them  Nor need I endeavour to give them Weight  by hinting to you  that not only your own Health and Spirits  but the Health  Strength  and Happiness of that  which may  one Day  be as dear to you as your own  entirely depend upon the prudent Regimen of yourself  at this Time  I am up every Morning at Five  tho  I do not go to Bed  till Twelve  and  notwithstanding the Labour of Body  and Anxiety of Mind  I go through  all the Day  I feel such Chearfulness and Flow of Spirits about me  owing to this alone  that I cannot contain myself from singing and dancing about my Fields  like one stung by the Tarantula   I am now gone through your three Letters  and am sorry they are at an End  for  like a Page  247 Person used to speak from Notes  I have nothing more to say  but — that  I am  my charming Girl  no less your s  than ever  and I cannot say more   Henry   LETTER CCLXXVII   WHEN I challenged you upon your talking of Death  I did not mean  that you spoke of it in such a splenetic Way  as betrayed a Fear of dying  I was rather apprehensive  that you mentioned it in a Manner  which shewed no Sort of Concern about the Matter  and pardon me  my best and latest Hope  if this should naturally alarm both my Fears and Jealousy  You sometimes unkindly take me to Pieces  and I am not Beauty enough to stand such a Scrutiny  If you would fairly lump me all together  I flatter myself you would have Reason to be better satisfied with me  Thought  as you say  will not enlarge our Size  but a very little Reflection is capable of giving us higher Advantages  in a better Way  than the Stature of Typhon could boast   I never speak roughly to you  but out of my extreme Tenderness for you  and  when I said it was in your Power to be a cleverer Person than you were  I must have been miserably Page  248 misunderstood  to have this construed into an Affront  As for the Philosophy  you seem to reproach me with  I do not see how I can ever prove it s Virtue  with regard to you  for your Behaviour  I am certain  will never try it s Temper  and your Danger would be too strong for it s Resolution   Adieu   my Heart s Life   Henry   LETTER CCLXXVIII   BELIEVE me  my ever dear  my much loved Harry  when I tell you that my talking of Death need not alarm your Jealousy  for I solemnly declare  I find nothing dreadful in the Thoughts of his Approach  but the too tender Concern  I feel at parting with you  If this be a Crime  I confess my Guilt  But let it be a Consolation to you  as well as me  that I am not conscious of any other unrepented Sin  but find my
