in a blanket   This hangman of a muleteer  perceiving with what exquisite satisfaction I took in all this  went on tantalizing me with the joys of an ecclesiastical life  He never dropped the subject till we got to the village of Obisa  and stopped there to refresh our mules  Then  while bustling about the inn  he accidentally dropped a paper from his pocket  which I was cunning enough to pick up without his seeing me  and took an opportunity of reading while he was in the stable  It was a letter addressed to the governors and superintendents of the orphan school  conceived in these terms   Gentlemen  I consider it as an act at once of charity and of duty  to send you back a little truant  he seems a shrewd lad enough  and may do very well with good looking after  By dint of hard and frequent chastisement  I doubt not but you will ultimately bring him to a sense of his own unworthiness and your benevolence  May a blessing be vouchsafed on your pious and charitable labours  for the early extirpation of sin and wickedness   Signed   THE MINISTER OF GALVES    When I had finished reading this pleasant letter  which let me into the good intentions of his reverence the rector  it required little deliberation to determine what I was to do  from the inn to the banks of the Tagus  a space of three good miles  was but a hop  step  and jump  Fear lent me wings to escape from the governors of the foundling hospital  whither I was absolutely resolved never to return  having formed principles of taste diametrically opposite to their method of teaching the classics  I went into Toledo with as light a heart as if I had known where to get my daily bread  To be sure  it is a town of ways and means  where a man who can live by his wits need never die of hunger  Scarcely had I reached the high street  when a well  dressed gentleman by whom I brushed  caught me by the arm  saying  My little fellow  do you want a place  You are just such a smart lad as I was looking for  And you are just the master for my money  answered I  Since that is the case  rejoined he  you are mine from this moment  and have only to follow me  which I did without asking any more questions   This spark  about the age of thirty  and bearing the name of Don Abel  lodged in very handsome ready furnished apartments  He was by profession a blacklegs  and the following was the nature of our engagement  In the morning I got him as much tobacco as would smoke five or six pipes  brushed his clothes  and ran for a barber to shave him and trim his whiskers  after which he made the circle of the tennis courts  whence he never returned home till eleven or twelve at night  But every morning  at going out  he gave me three reals for the expenses of the day  leaving me master of my own time till ten o clock in the evening  and provided I was within doors by his return  all was well  He gave me a livery besides  in which I looked like a little lackey of illicit love  I took very kindly to my condition  and certainly could not have met with any more congenial with my temper   Such and so happy had been my way of life for nearly a month  when my employer inquired whether I liked his service  and on my answer in the affirmative  Well  then  resumed he  to morrow we shall set out for Seville  whither my concerns call me  You will not be sorry to see the capital of Andalusia   He that hath not Seville seen   says the proverb   Is no traveller I ween   I engaged at once to follow him all over the world  On that very day  the Seville carrier fetched away a large trunk with my master s wardrobe  and on the next morning we were on the road for Andalusia   Signor Don Abel was so lucky at play  that he never lost but when it was convenient  but then it was seldom convenient to stay long in a place  because those who are always losers find out at last  that though chance is a dangerous antagonist  certainly it is a desperate one  and that accounted for our journey  On our arrival at Seville  we took lodgings near the Cordova gate  and resumed the same mode of life as at Toledo  But my master found some difference between the two towns  The Seville tennis courts could produce players equally in fortune s good graces with himself  so that he sometimes came home a good deal out of humour  One morning  when he was biting the bridle for the loss of a hundred pistoles the day before  he asked why I had not carried his linen to the laundress  I pleaded forgetfulness  Thereupon  flying into a passion  be gave me half a dozen boxes on the ear  in such a style  as to kindle an illumination in my blinking eyes  to which the glories of Solomon s temple were no more to
