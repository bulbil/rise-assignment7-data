greater eulogiums on it than it merited    they were charmed with the fine library  the museum  the magnificence of   the halls belonging to the various colleges  the physick garden  and   other curious walks  but that which  above all the rest  gave the most   satisfaction to Miss Betsy  as well as to her companion  was that   respectful gallantry with which they found themselves treated by the   gentlemen of the university  Mr  Francis was extremely beloved amongst   them  on account of his affability  politeness  and good humour  and   they seemed glad of an opportunity of shewing the regard they had for   the brother  by paying all manner of civilities to the sister  he gave   the ladies an elegant entertainment at his own rooms  to which also some   of those with whom he was the most intimate were invited  All these   thought themselves bound to return the same compliment  the company of   every one present was desired at their respective apartments  and as   each of these gentlemen had  besides  other particular friends of their   own  whom they wished to oblige  the number of guests was still   increased at every feast       By this means  Miss Betsy and Miss Flora soon acquired a very large   acquaintance  and as  through the care of Mr  Francis  they were lodged   in one of the best and most reputable houses in town  their families   known  and themselves were young ladies who knew how to behave  as well   as dress  and receive company in the most elegant and polite manner    every one was proud of a pretence for visiting them       The respect paid to them would  doubtless  have every day increased   during the whole time they should have thought proper to continue in   Oxford  and on quitting it  have left behind them the highest idea of   their merit  if  by one inconsiderate action  they had not at once   forfeited the esteem they had gained  and rendered themselves the   subjects of ridicule  even to those who before had regarded them with   veneration       They were walking out one day  about an hour or two before the time in   which they usually dined  into the park  where they were met by a   gentleman commoner and a young student  both of whom they had been in   company with at most of the entertainments before mentioned  The sparks   begged leave to attend them  which was readily granted  they walked all   together for some time  but the weather being very warm  the   gentleman commoner took an occasion to remind the ladies how much their   beauties would be in danger of suffering from the immoderate rays of   Phoebus  and proposed going to some gardens full of the most beautiful   alcoves and arbours  so shaded over that the sun  even in his meridian   force  could  at the most  but glimmer through the delightful gloom  he   painted the pleasures of the place  to which he was desirous of leading   them  with so romantick an energy  that they immediately  and without   the least scruple or hesitation  consented to be conducted thither       This was a condescension which he who asked it  scarce expected would be   granted  and  on finding it so easily obtained  began to form some   conjectures no way to the advantage of those ladies reputations  It is   certain  indeed  that as he professed a friendship for the brother  he   ought not  in strict honour  to have proposed any thing to the sister   which would be unbecoming her to agree to  but he was young  gay to an   excess  and in what he said or did took not always consideration for his   guide       They went on laughing  till they came to the place he mentioned  where   the gentlemen  having shewed their faire companions into the gardens  in   which were  indeed  several recesses  no less dark than had been   described  on entering one of them  Miss Betsy cried   Bless me  this is   fit for nothing but for people to do what they are ashamed of in the   light     The fitter then  Madam   replied the gentleman commoner   to   encourage a lover  who  perhaps  has suffered more through his own   timidity than the cruelty of the object he adores   He accompanied these   words with a seizure of both her hands  and two or three kisses on her   lips  The young student was no less free with Miss Flora  but neither of   these ladies gave themselves the trouble to reflect what consequences   might possibly attend a prelude of this nature  and repulsed the   liberties they took in
