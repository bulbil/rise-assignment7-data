roused his heart to strong emotions  and stimulated his mind to the immediate achievement he had already planned  As for Mr  Crabshaw  he was not the last to signify his satisfaction at his master s return  After having kissed the hem of his garment  he retired to the stable  where he communicated these tidings to his friend Gilbert  whom he saddled and bridled  the same office he performed for Bronzomarte  then putting on his squire like attire and accoutrements  he mounted one  and led the other to the knight s door  before which he paraded  uttering  from time to time  repeated shouts  to the no small entertainment of the populace  until he received orders to house his companions  Thus commanded  he led them back to their stalls  resumed his livery  and rejoined his fellow servants  who were resolved to celebrate the day with banquets and rejoicings   Their master s heart was not sufficiently at ease to share in their festivity  He held a consultation with his friends in the parlour  whom he acquainted with the reasons he had to believe Miss Darnel was confined in the same house which had been his prison  a circumstance which filled them with equal pleasure and astonishment  Dolly in particular  weeping plentifully  conjured him to deliver her dear lady without delay  Nothing now remained but to concert the plan for her deliverance  As Aurelia had informed Dolly of her connexion with Mrs  Kawdle  at whose house she proposed to lodge  before she was overtaken on the road by her uncle  this particular was now imparted to the council  and struck a light which seemed to point out the direct way to Miss Darnel s enlargement   Our hero  accompanied by Mrs  Cowslip and Tom Clarke  set out immediately for the house of Dr  Kawdle  who happened to be abroad  but his wife received them with great courtesy  She was a well bred  sensible  genteel woman  and strongly attached to Aurelia by the ties of affection  as well as of consanguinity  She no sooner learned the situation of her cousin than she expressed the most impatient concern for her being set at liberty  and assured Sir Launcelot she would concur in any scheme he should propose for that purpose  There was no room for hesitation or choice  he attended her immediately to the judge  who  upon proper application  issued another search warrant for Aurelia Darnel  The constable and his posse were again retained  and Sir Launcelot Greaves once more crossed the threshold of Mr  Bernard Shackle  Nor was the search warrant the only implement of justice with which he had furnished himself for this visit  In going thither they agreed upon the method in which they should introduce themselves gradually to Miss Darnel  that her tender nature might not be too much shocked by their sudden appearance   When they arrived at the house  therefore  and produced their credentials  in consequence of which a female attendant was directed to show the lady s apartment  Mrs  Dolly first entered the chamber of the accomplished Aurelia  who  lifting up her eyes  screamed aloud  and flew into the arms of her faithful Cowslip  Some minutes elapsed before Dolly could make shift to exclaim   Am coom to live and daai with my beloved leady  — Dear Dolly   cried her mistress   I cannot express the pleasure I have in seeing you again  Good Heaven  what solitary hours of keen affliction have I passed since we parted —but  tell me  how did you discover the place of my retreat —has my uncle relented —do I owe your coming to his indulgence    Dolly answered in the negative  and by degrees gave her to understand that her cousin  Mrs  Kawdle  was in the next room  that lady immediately appeared  and a very tender scene of recognition passed between the two relations  It was she who  in the course of conversation  perceiving that Aurelia was perfectly composed  declared the happy tidings of her approaching deliverance  When the other eagerly insisted upon knowing to whose humanity and address she was indebted for this happy turn of fortune  her cousin declared the obligation was due to a young gentleman of Yorkshire  called Sir Launcelot Greaves  At mention of that name her face was overspread with a crimson glow  and her eyes beamed redoubled splendour   Cousin   said she  with a sigh   I know not what to say— that gentleman  Sir Launcelot Greaves  was surely born—Lord bless me  I tell you  cousin  he has been my guardian angel    Mrs  Kawdle  who had maintained a correspondence with her by letters  was no stranger to the former part of the connexion subsisting between those two lovers  and had always favoured the pretensions of our hero  without being acquainted with his person  She now observed with a smile  that as Aurelia esteemed the knight her guardian angel  and he adored her as a demi deity  nature seemed to have intended them for each other  for such sublime ideas exalted them both above the sphere of ordinary mortals  She then ventured to intimate that he was in the house  impatient to pay his respects in person  At this declaration the colour vanished from her cheeks  which  however  soon
