narrowly I escaped drowning   though my death   would have been your freedom  and I had made it your interest to   wish it   and your most agreeable confession in another place  that    notwithstanding all my hard usage of you  you could not hate me  and   that expressed in so sweet  so soft  and so innocent a manner  that I   flatter myself you may be brought to love me   together with the other   parts of your admirable Journal   I began to repent my parting with you    but  God is my witness  for no unlawful end  as you would call it  but   the very contrary  and the rather  as all this was improved in your   favour  by your behaviour at leaving my house  For  oh  that melodious   voice praying for me at your departure  and thanking me for my rebuke   to Mrs  Jewkes  still hangs upon my ears  and delights my memory  And   though I went to bed  I could not rest  but about two got up  and made   Thomas get one of the best horses ready  in order to set out to overtake   you  while I sat down to write this to you        Now  my dear Pamela  let me beg of you  on the receipt of this  to   order Robin to drive you back again to my house  I would have set out   myself  for the pleasure of bearing you company back in the chariot  but   am really indisposed  I believe  with vexation that I should part thus   with my soul s delight  as I now find you are  and must be  in spite of   the pride of my own heart        You cannot imagine the obligation your return will lay me under to your   goodness  and yet  if you will not so far favour me  you shall be under   no restraint  as you will see by my letter enclosed to Colbrand  which   I have not sealed  that you may read it  But spare me  my dearest girl    the confusion of following you to your father s  which I must do  if you   persist to go on  for I find I cannot live a day without you        If you are the generous Pamela I imagine you to be   for hitherto you   have been all goodness  where it has not been merited   let me see  by   this new instance  the further excellence of your disposition  let me   see you can forgive the man who loves you more than himself  let me see    by it  that you are not prepossessed in any other person s favour  And   one instance more I would beg  and then I am all gratitude  and that is    that you would despatch Monsieur Colbrand with a letter to your father    assuring him that all will end happily  and to desire  that he will   send to you  at my house  the letters you found means  by Williams s   conveyance  to send him  And when I have all my proud  and  perhaps    punctilious doubts answered  I shall have nothing to do  but to make you   happy  and be so myself  For I must be  Yours  and only yours         Monday morn  near three o clock           O my exulting heart  how it throbs in my bosom  as if it would reproach   me for so lately upbraiding it for giving way to the love of so dear   a gentleman   But take care thou art not too credulous neither  O fond   believer  Things that we wish  are apt to gain a too ready credence with   us  This sham marriage is not yet cleared up  Mrs  Jewkes  the vile Mrs    Jewkes  may yet instigate the mind of this master  His pride of heart    and pride of condition  may again take place  And a man that could in so   little a space  first love me  then hate  then banish me his house    and send me away disgracefully  and now send for me again  in such   affectionate terms  may still waver  may still deceive thee  Therefore   will I not acquit thee yet  O credulous  fluttering  throbbing mischief    that art so ready to believe what thou wishest  And I charge thee to   keep better guard than thou hast lately done  and lead me not to follow   too implicitly thy flattering and desirable impulses  Thus foolishly   dialogued I with my heart  and yet  all the time  this heart is Pamela       I opened the letter to Monsieur Colbrand  which
