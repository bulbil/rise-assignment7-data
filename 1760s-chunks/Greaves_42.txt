for on all these subjects the deliberations of a House of Commons occasionally turn    But these great purposes will never be answered by electing an illiterate savage  scarce qualified  in point of understanding  to act as a country justice of peace  a man who has scarce ever travelled beyond the excursion of a fox chase  whose conversation never rambles farther than his stable  his kennel  and the barnyard  who rejects decorum as degeneracy  mistakes rusticity for independence  ascertains his courage by leaping over gates and ditches  and founds his triumph on feats of drinking  who holds his estate by a factious tenure  professes himself the blind slave of a party  without knowing the principles that gave it birth  or the motives by which it is actuated  and thinks that all patriotism consists in railing indiscriminately at ministers  and obstinately opposing every measure of the administration  Such a man  with no evil intentions of his own  might be used as a dangerous tool in the hands of a desperate faction  by scattering the seeds of disaffection  embarrassing the wheels of government  and reducing the whole kingdom to anarchy    Here the knight was interrupted by the shouts and acclamations of the Vanderpelfites  who cried aloud   Hear him  hear him  long life to the iron cased orator   This clamour subsiding  he prosecuted his harangue to the following effect —   Such a man as I have described may be dangerous from ignorance  but is neither so mischievous  nor so detestable as the wretch who knowingly betrays his trust  and sues to be the hireling and prostitute of a weak and worthless minister  a sordid knave  without honour or principle  who belongs to no family whose example can reproach him with degeneracy  who has no country to command his respect  no friend to engage his affection  no religion to regulate his morals  no conscience to restrain his iniquity  and who worships no God but Mammon  an insinuating miscreant  who undertakes for the dirtiest work of the vilest administration  who practises national usury  receiving by wholesale the rewards of venality  and distributing the wages of corruption by retail    In this place our adventurer s speech was drowned in the acclamations of the fox hunters  who now triumphed in their turn  and hoicksed the speaker  exclaiming   Well opened  Jowler—to  un  to  un again  Sweetlips  hey  Merry  Whitefoot   After a short interruption  he thus resumed his discourse —   When such a caitiff presents himself to you  like the devil  with a temptation in his hand  avoid him as if he were in fact the devil—it is not the offering of disinterested love  for what should induce him  who has no affections  to love you  to whose persons he is an utter stranger  alas  it is not a benevolence  but a bribe  He wants to buy you at one market that he may sell you at another  Without doubt his intention is to make an advantage of his purchase  and this aim he cannot accomplish but by sacrificing  in some sort  your interest  your independency  to the wicked designs of a minister  as he can expect no gratification for the faithful discharge of his duty  But  even if he should not find an opportunity of selling you to advantage  the crime  the shame  the infamy  will still be the same in you  who  baser than the most abandoned prostitutes  have sold yourselves and your posterity for hire—for a paltry price  to be refunded with interest by some minister  who will indemnify himself out of your own pockets  for  after all  you are bought and sold with your own money—the miserable pittance you may now receive is no more than a pitcher full of water thrown in to moisten the sucker of that pump which will drain you to the bottom  Let me therefore advise and exhort you  my countrymen  to avoid the opposite extremes of the ignorant clown and the designing courtier  and choose a man of honesty  intelligence  and moderation  who will ——  The doctrine of moderation was a very unpopular subject in such an assembly  and  accordingly  they rejected it as one man  They began to think the stranger wanted to set up for himself  a supposition that could not fail to incense both sides equally  as they were both zealously engaged in their respective causes  The Whigs and the Tories joined against this intruder  who  being neither  was treated like a monster  or chimera in politics  They hissed  they hooted  and they hallooed  they annoyed him with missiles of dirt  sticks  and stones  they cursed  they threatened and reviled  till  at length  his patience was exhausted    Ungrateful and abandoned miscreants   he cried   I spoke to you as men and Christians—as free born Britons and fellow citizens  but I perceive you are a pack of venal  infamous scoundrels  and I will treat you accordingly   So saying  he brandished his lance  and riding into the thickest of the concourse  laid about him with such dexterity and effect  that the multitude was immediately dispersed  and he retired without further molestation   The same
