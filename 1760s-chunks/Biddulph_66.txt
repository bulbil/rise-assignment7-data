am I obliged to sustain  Mrs Gerrarde has    been to see me  gay and assured as ever  She affected to condole with me on the accident that happened to my foot  with such an overstrained concern  such a tender solicitude  that her insincerity disgusted me  if possible  more than the other part of her behaviour  She told me  she herself had been at the play  but very luckily had got out without receiving any injury  I said  I was surprized I had not seen her there  O  replied she  I was in a little snug corner  where nobody could see me  for having refused to go with some ladies that asked me  I did not chuse to be visible in the house  and so squeezed myself up into what they called their gallery  for I took nobody with me but my maid  Audacious woman —Is it not strange  my dear  that Mr Arnold could be so weak as to humour her in the absurd frolick of going with her to such a place  for so it must have been  or perhaps she appointed him only to call for her at the play  and he might have arrived but just in time to assist her in getting out  No matter which it was   September 9  I was born to sacrifice my own peace to that of other people  my life is become miserable  but I have no remedy for it but patience   Mr Arnold spends whole days abroad  at night we are separated on account of my indisposition  so that we hardly ever converse together  What a dreadful prospect have I before me  O  Cecilia  may you never experience the bitterness of having your husband’s heart alienated from you   Lady V——  that best of creatures  is with me constantly  she presses me to come to her house  as my ancle is now pretty well  yet I am obliged to excuse myself  I am distressed to the last degree at the conduct I shall be forced to observe towards her  yet dare not explain the motive  Causeless jealousy is always the subject of ridicule  and at all events Mr Arnold must not be exposed to this   September 12  I am weary of inventing excuses for absenting myself from V—— hall  My lady has done solliciting me  yet continues her friendly and affectionate visits  I fear she guesses my situation  though she has not as yet hinted at it  but her forbearing to press me any more on the subject of going to her  and at the same time not requiring a reason for this breach of civility as well as friendship  convinced me  that she suspects the cause of my restraint  I am now perfectly recovered  yet    do I still confine myself to my house  to avoid as much as possible giving umbrage to lady V——  but this restraint cannot last much longer  Mrs Gerrarde teazes me to come to her  and I have promised to make her my first visit   September 27  Said I not that my fate was near its crisis  Where will this impending ruin end  Take  my Cecilia  the occurrences of this frightful day   Mr Arnold rode out this morning  and told me he should not return till night  He asked me  with that indifference which now accompanies all his words  How I meant to dispose of myself for the day  I told him  I had no design of going abroad  and should spend my time in reading  or at my needle  This was my real intention  but Mr Arnold had but just left the house  when I received a message from Mrs Gerrarde to know how I did  and to tell me she was not well  and much out of spirits  or she would come and pass the day with me  but that she insisted on my dining with her  As I had told Mr Arnold I did not mean to go out  I really had neither intention nor inclination to do so  But shall I confess my weakness to you  I suspected that he purposed spending the day  as he often did  with Mrs Gerrarde  and the more so from the question he had asked me on his going abroad  he thought I might probably pay her a visit  and this intrusion was a circumstance he had a mind to be guarded against  by knowing before hand my designs  I had not been to see Mrs Gerrarde since my recovery  and it was natural to suppose I would return her visits  Possessed as I was with this opinion  her message gave me a secret satisfaction  as it served to convince me Mr Arnold was not to be with her  for she generally detained me late when I went to her house  From what trivial circumstances will the afflicted draw consolation  or an additional weight of grief  So it was  I felt a sort of pleasure  in thinking  that for all that day at least Mr Arnold would absent himself from my rival—My rival  mean word  she is not worthy to be called so  from his mistress let it be  In short  I resolved to go  especially as she had sent me word she was not well  and I
