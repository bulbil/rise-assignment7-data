and which I did not carry as far as I might  with a little Reflection  at that Time  lest it should look like a premeditated Essay  what was  in Reality  but an occasional Occurrence  though  after what Manner hinted to me  from any Part of my Letter  I cannot  at present  recollect   The only Objection which Divines make to the unbounded Mercy of God  is his infinite Justice  for  say they  Justice is concerned about punishing the Wicked  as well as rewarding Page  153 the Virtuous  and the only Scope they will allow to Mercy  is Remission upon Repentance   Now let us consider the Matter impartially among ourselves  for observe  there is nobody by  but you and I   In the first Place  it is high Presumption to pretend to reason about the Attributes of God  and all Definitions of this Kind may be considered   like the Eye in Prospect  whose  Strength can find no End  but Weakness makes one   The Qualities and Faculties of the human Mind  from whence they vainly argue  may have  and it is more than probable  so little Relation to the divine Mind  that there may not be even any Analogy between them  and may  perhaps  to a Spirit capable of conceiving both  be as different Ideas  as Sound and Colour     But let us dispute with them  upon their own Terms  and speak of God as Man  and let us agree  for the Sake of Argument  that  though the Qualities of a human Creature certainly bear no Proportion to the Attributes  they may  however  have such a Relation to them as Time has to Eternity  and thus we may come to a clear Method of reasoning upon this Subject   Human Justice then  as blended with human Passions and human Policies  may be defined a Retribution of Rewards and Punishments  but  Page  154 to consider it in the Abstract  I do not think that even human Justice comprehends the latter Part of this Definition  for Punishments are inflicted either to revenge or to deter  Now  with Regard to the first  a Legislature is dispassionate  and  with Regard to the latter  I am sure  that if a Man could commit any Crime  which it was impossible for him  or any body else  ever to commit again  it would be a Cruelty to allot any Penalty for it  because  in this Case  the Benefit of the Example would never operate  In this State  then  I look upon our Souls in the next World  as having committed Offences  which we can no longer repeat  and the Punishment of which can then no more avail us  or serve as a wholesome Example  to deter others  nor is God a Man  that he should be angry   I shall not add any thing farther upon this Head  but just to observe to you  that the Definition of Mercy  as it is given in the Beginning of this Discourse  absolutely annihilates the Virtue  by making it only Part of another  for Forgiveness  upon Repentance  is not a distinct Operation  according to that Sense  but merely a Piece of Justice  If I forgive my Debtor  he is obliged to my Generosity  But  if he pays the Debt  he releases himself  and I but perform common Equity  by giving up his Obligation  upon Conditions performed  Adieu   Henry   Page  155  LETTER CCXXXII  FRANCES to HENRY   THE unsettled  and  of Course  uncomfortable Situation I have been in  these three Months  makes me feel a very sincere Satisfaction at being able to date this Letter from my own Apartment  or  rather  your s  for I cannot  will not call it mine   till you have blest it with your Presence  Haste  then  my dearest Life  my kindest Love  my All  my Being  haste  and restore your Fanny to the Enjoyment of herself in you  bring to her Wishes  to her Transports bring all that can make Mortality endured  and render Immortality still more desirable   The Impatience of my fond Desire to see you  has hurried my Imagination into a Kind of Rhapsody  but I own I should think it a Crime to love you after the common  sober  insipid Manner  and  if Excess of Love be pardonable in any Woman  I may stand excused  My Constitution is naturally cold  nor could it be warmed into Love by an Object less worthy  than my Heart s dear Harry  This Declaration  which is  indeed  a true one  may well secure you from any Fear of Change in my Heart  I wish  both for your Sake and my Page  156 own  that I had Merits sufficient to furnish me with the same Security  But  as your Love and Constancy outweigh even your other Merits to me  I will rest satisfied  from my Dependence on them  though conscious of my Want of Worth to deserve them  in any other Way  but by returning them an hundred fold   I cannot help saying  I am sorry the Correspondence  between Lady
