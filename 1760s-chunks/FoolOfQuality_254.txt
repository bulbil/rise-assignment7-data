  occasions  to give to all men an account of the political faith that   is in me      It is extremely surprising  rejoined Mr  Fenton  that all our lay   and ecclesiastical champions for arbitrary power who have raised   such a dust  and kept such a coil about the divine  hereditary  and   indefeasible right of kings  and the unconditional duty of passive   obedience in the subject  have founded their whole pile of argument   and oratory on the divine appointment of the regal government of   the Jews  as the perfect model and ensample whereby all other   states are  in like manner  required to form their respective   governments      Now  if these champions had engaged on the opposite side of the   question  and had undertaken the argument against arbitrary power    they could not have done it more effectually  more conclusively    more unanswerably  than by showing that arbitrary power was the   very evil so displeasing to the nature of God  that he exhibited his   omnipotence in a series of public and astonishing wonders  in order   to deliver this very people from the grievance thereof  and more   especially to proclaim to all nations and ages the detestation in   which his eternal justice holds all lawless dispensations all acts of   sovereign power that are not acts of protection      Could these champions  again  have better enforced the argument   against arbitrary power  than by showing that this people so   miraculously enfranchised  but now fat  and wantonly kicking under   the indulgence of their God  had taken a loathing to the righteous    ness of the dispensations of their deliverer   had rejected him   as   he affirms    from reigning over them     and had required a King          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  269     like to the kings of the neighbouring nations   the very evil from   which God had redeemed their forefathers       Could these champions  further  have better demonstrated the   miseries  the iniquities  the abominations of such a government    than by reciting the expostulations  the tender and earnest re    monstrances  of God himself  on the sufferings that these rebels   were about to bring upon themselves from the enormities of an   arbitrary and unlimited sovereignty  And lastly  could they have   better recommended  to the free and the virtuous  to stand out to   the death against arbitrary oppression  than by showing the obstinacy   of these apostate Jews  when they answered to the compassionating   expostulations of their God  Nay  but we will have a king like all   the nations  to rule over us         Nothing  my Harry  can be more unaccountable  more astonishing    than the perverseness of that stiff necked nation      They daily drank the bitterest dregs of slavery   they had been   galled by double chains  and had groaned under an unprecedented   tyranny and oppression  They cried out to their God  and he   miraculously delivered them from the land of their misery  and from   the house of their bondage  Yet  on the first cravings of appetite    these soul sensualized wretches desired to be returned to their   chains and their flesh pots  and longed to groan and gormandize in   their old sty      Hereupon God gave them flesh and bread to the full   and he   brought them into a land   flowing with milk and honey   and   abounding with all the good things of this life  He made them a   free and sovereign people   discomfited their enemies before them     and informed their judges with his own spirit for the dispensation   of righteousness   insomuch that   every man sat under his own   vine  and did what was right in his own eyes   And yet they   lasciviously petitioned to be subjected to a state of absolute des    potism   and this for no assigned reason  save because it was the   fashion   Make us a king to judge us  like to all the nations   around us       Here God  in the same act  approves his attributes of mercy   and reluctant justice to his erring creatures  He punishes their   rebellion by no greater a severity than the grant of their request        And the Lord said unto Samuel  Hearken unto the voice of the   people in all that they say unto thee   for they have not rejected   thee  but they have rejected me  that I should not reign over them    Howbeit  protest solemnly unto them  and show them the manner   of the king that shall reign over them
