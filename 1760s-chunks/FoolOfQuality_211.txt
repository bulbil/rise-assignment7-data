you    And now  tell me the truth  Did you ever love your husband     Yes  dearly  indeed very dearly did I love him   for he had loved   me very dearly till that miserable night  But when  as I thought    he had killed my brother  I hated him as much as I had ever loved   him before  But then again  when my Tommy had recovered of   his wounds  I sent far and near to inquire after him and find him   out   and when I could learn no tidings of him  I put it into all the   printed papers that Thomas Darner was well recovered  and that   Barnabas Tirrel  who had wounded him  might return without   danger to his wife and infant      And he is returned   shouted John he is returned  my Nelly     Your barbarous and bloody husband  who stabbed your brother    and left you and your infant to famish  he is returned to you  my   Nelly   and  in his death  he shall make you amends for all the   sufferings which he brought upon you during his lifetime   But    my master  my dearest master  send immediately for my child  my   Jemmy  I beseech you  that  bad as I am myself  I may give him   a father s blessing before I die      I was surprised and affected  madam  beyond expression  by inci    dents that were at once so wonderful and so tender   and I directly   sent servants and a sedan chair for James  with orders to have him   carefully and warmly wrapped up   for what his mother told me   of him had already given me a very strong prejudice in his favour    Meanwhile  Mrs  Tirrel had sunk on her knees by her husband s   bedside  and was plentifully pouring forth her tears upon him     partly for joy of having found him  and partly for grief of having   found him in that condition      O  my Nelly  my Nelly   cried Barnabas   had I known who the   person was whose blood I drew that terrible night   would sooner have   thrust my knife into my own heart  than into any part of the body   of that dear brother of yours  But I was old and ugly  you know     and you were young and handsome   and jealousy is a mad devil         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  217     that rages in the breast like hell fire   it never knew how to spare    but tears and consumes every thing that comes within its reach      At length James was brought to us   and as we were in his father s   apartments  a chamber in no way adorned  James entered without   any respect to persons  lie was a tall and comely youth  but very   pale and lean   and as it was one of his well days  he walked in   without help  He had barely been told that his mother sent for   him in a hurry  so that he entered with a visible alarm in his   countenance      What is the matter  my dear mother   says he  Alas   I am little   able to help you at present  I hope nothing has happened that is   suddenly distressful  Nothing amiss  my child  more than that your   dear father  for whom I have sought and been sighing this many a   year your father lies dangerously ill in this very bed  my Jemmy    Am I then so blessed  cried the boy  as to see and embrace a   father   O my child   exclaimed the old man  and eagerly stretched   his arms towards him  come to my bosom  thou only offspring of my   bowels   I may now say  with blessed Jacob  Let me die  let me   die  since I have seen thy face  and thou art alive  my son       I would at any time give a thousand pounds  my cousin  for a   tenth of the enjoyment that I then had  in the feelings which God   poured into the hearts of this little family  on their so very un    expected and marvellous a meeting  It appeared to me  however    that young James even exceeded his parents in love  and this   gave me such a cordial attachment to him  that from that hour   to this we have never been sundered  He never failed nor for    sook me  and at this very day he is my respected friend  and   the superintendent of my family      John
