feel  and that Understanding  you alone have fashioned  is capable of bestowing  and let my Sensibility of your Merit excuse the Want of it in me   I have not  since you left Town  had Leisure to read a  in Montaigne  or any other Author  I have indeed passed thro  such a Series of Hurry  Disquiet  and Fatigue  that I am more than half dead  it is not to be told how much I am changed by it  but I flatter myself  that the Pleasure of seeing you  and the Hopes I have of enjoying Peace and Content in the Country  will restore me to myself  or something better   I am still in the same disagreeable Way  with Regard to my Health —perhaps  I am vapourish  and fancy myself worse  than I really am     271I saw — this Day  he says your Cough still continues —for Heaven s Sake  how can you be so excessively ill natured  as not to take some Care of yourself  You must  on this Occasion  give me Leave to remind you of that noblest Part of Seneca s Philosophy  which your favourite Author mentions —   He that loves not his Wife  or Friend so well  as to prolong his Health for them  but will obstinately die  is too delicate and effeminate  the Soul must impose this on itself  when the Utility of our Friends does so require it  it is a Testimony of Grandeur and Courage  to preserve one s Life  for the Consideration of another  when a Man perceives that this Office is pleasing  agreeable  or useful to some Person  by whom we are tenderly beloved     Taking this for granted  what Judgment am I to form of your Affection for me  who have so earnestly sollicited you to apply the proper Means for surmounting that nasty  obstinate  ill natured Cough  If it were only from a Desire of conquering any Thing so perverse  I would get the better of it  I hope this Consideration will have more Weight  than any other I have been able to offer  for  alas    my Advocation is not now in Tune     The Pain in my Chest is so extreme  that I am not able to stoop longer —Adieu  then  my dearest Harry  I am  as I shall never cease to be  faithfully and affectionately Your s  Frances     272  LETTER CXL   Dear FANNY   I Received your Laconic Epistle  which I could wish had been still shorter  as far as it mentions your being out of Order  I am myself a ittle unwell  from drinking these three Days past  and it must be a very irksome Reflection  not to be able to recollect any one Enjoyment  of which my present Pain was the Purchase  for Drinking  in general  you know I hate  and yet I would rather have drank alone  than in the Company I debauched with  Do not think me conceited in this Speech  for I really look upon it rather as an Imperfection than a Refinement  that so few People are agreeable to my Taste  as it is the Sign of a depraved Appetite  not to be able to relish plain and simple Meats  The Men of half  or quarter Understandings  disgust me most  and mere Fools I can live tolerably well with  provided they be good humoured  tho  a good humoured Fool may be compared to a fine Day in Winter  which keeps us all the While in Pain with the Fear of losing it  as it has not a Season to support it  It is Sense alone  which can give Constancy to Chearfulness or Virtue   My Disrelish to Company is a good deal owing to a certain splenetic Cast of Mind  which I have contracted from some Mortifications and Disappointments  I have formerly met with    273 joined to some Uneasinesses I  at present  labour under  which evil Habit  as I am well aware of  I shall endeavour to get the better of  as fast as possible  For  should I suffer such a Humour as this to grow upon me  it might render me incapable of enjoying the Favours  which  perhaps  Fortune has in Store for me  and would be as absurd  as unmanning one s self  upon being crossed in Love   You have  my charming Girl  a good deal to answer for  with Regard to my Disrelish of Conversation  in general  and are likely to increase the Evil every Day  For your Taste and Understanding improves constantly  or  to speak more properly  is more illustrated  For I believe that  in Proportion as my Sense improves  or Taste refines  I may be said rather to discover new Beauties  than you to acquire them  Here I shall observe to you  what you have sometimes upbraided me with  that I did not seem to increase in my Love for you  from the first Time I declared my Regards  Which Observation is true enough  for my Love was perfect  at first  as I esteemed and valued you  not only for what you then were  but by a Prae sentiment
