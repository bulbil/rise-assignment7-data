son with great tenderness  crying   My dear boy  God be praised for having given you such a feeling heart   My father himself was moved  thof a practitioner of the law  and consequently used to distresses —He declared  that he had given no directions to distrain  and that the bailiff must have done it by his own authority — If that be the case   said the young squire   let the inhuman rascal be turned out of our service     Well  gemmen  all the children were immediately clothed and fed  and the poor widow had well nigh run distracted with joy  The old knight  being of a humane temper himself  was pleased to see such proofs of his son s generosity  He was not angry at his spending his money  but at squandering away his time among the dregs of the people  For you must know  he not only made matches  portioned poor maidens  and set up young couples that came together without money  but he mingled in every rustic diversion  and bore away the prize in every contest  He excelled every swain of that district in feats of strength and activity  in leaping  running  wrestling  cricket  cudgel playing  and pitching the bar  and was confessed to be  out of sight  the best dancer at all wakes and holidays  Happy was the country girl who could engage the young squire as her partner  To be sure  it was a comely sight for to see as how the buxom country lasses  fresh and fragrant and blushing like the rose  in their best apparel dight  their white hose  and clean short dimity petticoats  their gaudy gowns of printed cotton  their top knots and stomachers  bedizened with bunches of ribbons of various colours  green  pink  and yellow  to see them crowned with garlands  and assembled on Mayday  to dance before Squire Launcelot  as he made his morning s progress through the village  Then all the young peasants made their appearance with cockades  suited to the fancies of their several sweethearts  and boughs of flowering hawthorn  The children sported about like flocks of frisking lambs  or the young fry swarming under the sunny bank of some meandering river  The old men and women  in their holiday garments  stood at their doors to receive their benefactor  and poured forth blessings on him as he passed  The children welcomed him with their shrill shouts  the damsels with songs of praise  and the young men  with the pipe and tabor  marched before him to the May pole  which was bedecked with flowers and bloom  There the rural dance began  A plentiful dinner  with oceans of good liquor  was bespoke at the White Hart  The whole village was regaled at the squire s expense  and both the day and the night was spent in mirth and pleasure    Lord help you  he could not rest if he thought there was an aching heart in the whole parish  Every paltry cottage was in a little time converted into a pretty  snug  comfortable habitation  with a wooden porch at the door  glass casements in the windows  and a little garden behind  well stored with greens  roots  and salads  In a word  the poor s rate was reduced to a mere trifle  and one would have thought the golden age was revived in Yorkshire  But  as I told you before  the old knight could not bear to see his only son so wholly attached to these lowly pleasures  while he industriously shunned all opportunities of appearing in that superior sphere to which he was designed by nature and by fortune  He imputed his conduct to meanness of spirit  and advised with my father touching the properest expedient to wean his affections from such low born pursuits  My father counselled him to send the young gentleman up to London  to be entered as a student in the Temple  and recommended him to the superintendence of some person who knew the town  and might engage him insensibly in such amusements and connexions  as would soon lift his ideas above the humble objects on which they had been hitherto employed    This advice appeared so salutary  that it was followed without the least hesitation  The young squire himself was perfectly well satisfied with the proposal  and in a few days he set out for the great city  But there was not a dry eye in the parish at his departure  although he prevailed upon his father to pay in his absence all the pensions he had granted to those who could not live on the fruit of their own industry  In what manner he spent his time in London  it is none of my business to inquire  thof I know pretty well what kind of lives are led by gemmen of your Inns of Court —I myself once belonged to Serjeants  Inn  and was perhaps as good a wit and a critic as any Templar of them all  Nay  as for that matter  thof I despise vanity  I can aver with a safe conscience  that I had once the honour to belong to the society called the Town  We were all of us attorney s clerks  gemmen  and had our meetings at an ale house in Butcher Row  where we
