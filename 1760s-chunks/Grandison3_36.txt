admiration  such gratitude  the doctor says  were expressed from every mouth  that his own eyes  as well as Mr  Sylvester s  and most of those present  more than once  were ready to overflow   Every thing was there settled  and even a match proposed by Sir Charles  and the proposal received with approbation on both sides  between the elder Miss Galliard  and that audacious young man the drug merchant  who recovered  by his behaviour in this meeting  his reputation with Sir Charles  and every body   The doctor says  that Mr  Hervey and Mr  Poussin  the two masters of the young gentlemen  are very worthy men  so is Mr  Galliard  And they behaved so handsomely on the occasion  that Sir Charles expressed himself highly pleased with them all  For Mr  Hervey and Mr  Galliard offered to accept of less money than Sir Charles made the young people worth  the one for a portion with Miss Danby  the other for   88 admitting the elder Danby into a partnership with him  on his marriage with his niece  But Sir Charles had no notion  he said  of putting young men  of good characters and abilities  to difficulties at their entrance into the world  The greatest expences  he observed  were then incurred  In slight or scanty beginnings  scanty plans must be laid  and pursued  Mr  Galliard then declared  that the younger Danby should have the handsomer fortune with his daughter  if she approved of him  for the very handsome one Miss Danby would carry to his son   Sir Charles s example  in short  fired every one with emulation  and three marriages  with the happiest prospects  are likely very soon to follow these noble instances of generosity  Mr  Sylvester proposed the celebration on one day  In that case  the gentlemen joined to hope Sir Charles would honour them with his presence  He assentingly bowed  How many families are here  at once made happy   Dr  Bartlett  after he had given us this relation  said  on our joining in one general blessing of his patron  You know not  Ladies  you know not  my Lord  what a general Philanthropist your brother is  His whole delight is in doing good  It has always been so  And to mend the hearts  as well as fortunes  of men  is his glory   We could not but congratulate the doctor on his having so considerable a hand  as Sir Charles always  Lord L  said  delighted to own  in cultivating his innate good principles  at so critical a time of life  as that was  in which they became acquainted   The doctor very modesty received the compliment  and  to wave our praises  gave us another instance of the great manner in which Sir Charles conferred benefits  as follows   He once  said the doctor  when his fortune was not what it now is  lent a very honest man  a merchant of Leghorn  when he resided there  as he did sometimes   89 for a month or two together  for the conveniency of the English chapel  a considerable sum  and took his bond for it  After a while  things not answering to the poor man s expectation  Mr  Grandison took notice to me  said the doctor  that he appeared greatly depressed and dejected  and occasionally came into his company with such a sense of obligation in his countenance and behaviour  that he could not bear it  And why  said he  should I keep it in my power to distress a man  whose modesty and diffidence shew  that he deserves to be made easy —I may die suddenly  My executors may think it but justice to exact payment  And that exaction may involve him in as great difficulties as those were  from which the loan delivered him —I will make his heart light  Instead of suffering him to sigh over his uncertain prospects at his board  or in his bed  I will make both his board and his bed easy to him  His wife and his five children shall rejoice with him  they shall see the good man s countenance  as it used to do  shine upon them  and occasionally meet mine with grateful comfort   He then cancelled the bond  And  at the same time  fearing the man s distress might be deeper than he owned  offered him the loan of a further sum  But  by his behaviour upon it  I found  said Mr  Grandison  that the sum he owed  and the doubt he had of being able to pay it in time  were the whole of the honest man s grievance  He declined  with gratitude  the additional offer  and walked  ever after  erect   He is now living  and happy  proceeded the doctor  and  just before Mr  Grandison left Italy  would have made him some part of payment  from the happier turn in his affairs  which  probably  was owing to his revived spirits  But Mr  Grandison asked  What he thought he meant  when he cancelled the obligation —Yet he told him  that it was not wrong in him
