pleasant spot  where the turf was circled in by tall and branching oaks  whose gigantic limbs  interwoven over our heads  formed a natural vault  not to be penetrated even by noon day heat  We took the bridle off the horse to let him feed after he was unloaded  Then down we sat  pulling out of brother Anthony s wallet some large pieces of bread and good substantial slices of roast meat  at which we began pegging with all possible pertinacity  Nevertheless  let our appetites be as obstinate as they might  we every now and then suspended the fray to spar a little with the flagon  which returned our blows till it made us reel again   About the end of the conflict  Don Raphael said to Don Alphonso     My brave comrade  after the confidence you have reposed in me  it is but fair that in my turn I should recount the history of my life to you with the same sincerity  You will do me a great favour  answered the young man  and an equal one to me  chimed in I  My curiosity is all alive to know your adventures  for doubtless they must afford much matter of useful speculation  You may rest assured of that  replied Don Raphael  and I mean to leave behind me a history of my own times  The composition shall be the amusement of my old age  for I am as yet in the prime of life  and mean to furnish in propriâ personâ many new hints for my commonplace book  But we are all weary  let us recruit with some hours of sleep  While we three lie down  Ambrose shall keep watch for fear of a surprise  and shall then take a nap in his turn  For though  to all appearance  we are here in perfect safety  it is always good to keep a sentry at the out posts  After this precaution he stretched himself along upon the grass  Don Alphonso did the same  I followed their example  and Lamela performed the office of a scout   Don Alphonso  so far from getting any rest  was incessantly brooding over his misfortunes  and I could not get a wink of sleep  As for Don Raphael  he snored most sonorously  But he awoke in little more than an hour  when  finding us in a listening mood  he said to Lamela    My friend Ambrose  you may now yield to the gentle influence of Morpheus  No  no  answered Lamela  my sleepy fit is over  and though I know all the passages of your life by rote  they are so instructive to the practitioners of our art and mystery  that I do not care how often I hear the tale over again  Without further preface  Don Raphael began the narrative of his adventures in these terms       BOOK THE FIFTH       CH  I     History of Don Raphael   I MADE my entrance on the stage of life at Madrid  where my mother was an actress  famous for dramatic  and infamous for her intriguing talents  Her name was Lucinda  As for my father  every man must have one  but my arithmetic is too scanty to determine the number of mine  It might indeed be a matter of history  that such or such a man of fashion was dangling after my mother at the epoch of my arrival in this system  but then  that mere fact would by no means warrant a deduction that any individual gallant of the mother must therefore be the father of the child  A lady  so eminent as she was in so notorious and wholesale a profession  must have many strings to her bow  where her blandishments are most publicly lavished  her favours are most sparingly bestowed  there is a show article or two for public exhibition  but her everyday wares are cheap  and hackneyed to the meanest purchaser   There is nothing like taking scandal by the beard  and treating the opinion of the world with heroic indifference  Lucinda  instead of cooping me up in a garret at home  made no scruple about owning her little bastard  but took me in her hand to the theatre with a modest assurance  regardless how the tongue of rumour might babble at her expense  or how the laugh of malice might peal at my unlucky appearance  In short  I was her pet  and came in for the caresses of all the men who frequented the house  One would have sworn that nature pleaded in my favour  and inspired each of them with a father s pride in the brat they had clubbed for  The twelve first years of my life were suffered to waste away in all kinds of frivolous amusements  Scarcely did they teach me to read and write  Still less was it thought of any consequence to initiate me in the principles of my religion  To dance  to sing  to play on the guitar  was the sum total of my early attainments  With these gifts and graces for my only acquisitions  the Marquis of Leganez asked for me to be about his only son  who was nearly of my own age  Lucinda gave her consent without reluctance  and it was then that I began to mind a
