make me acquainted with one Mr  Marmozet a celebrated player  who had lately appeared on the stage with astonishing eclat  and bore such sway in the house where he acted  that the managers durst not refuse any   295 thing he recommended  The young gentleman whom Lord Rattle had employed for this purpose  being diffident of his own interest with Mr  Marmozet  had recourse to a nobleman of his acquaintance  who  at his sollicitation  was so good as to introduce me to him  and the conversation turning upon my performance  I was not a little surprized  as well as pleased to hear  that Earl Sheerwit had spoke very much in its praise  and even sent Mr  Marmozet the copy  with a message expressing a desire that he would act in it next season—Nor was this favourite actor backward in commending the piece  which he mentioned with some expressions of regard  that I do not chuse to repeat  assuring me that he would appear in it  provided he should be engaged to play at all during the ensuing season  In the mean time  he desired I would give him leave to peruse it in the country  whither he intended to remove next day  that he might have leisure to consider and point out such alterations as might  perhaps  be necessary for the jeu de theatre  and took my direction  that he might communicate by letter  the observations he should make  Trusting to these assurances and the interest which had been made in my behalf  I hugged myself in the expectation of seeing it  not only acted  but acted to the greatest advantage  which I thought could not fail of recompensing me in an ample manner  for the anxiety and affliction I had undergone  But six weeks being elapsed  I did not know how to reconcile Mr  Marmozet s silence  with his promise of writing to me in ten days after he set out for the country  however  I was at last favoured with a letter  importing that he had made some remarks on my tragedy  which he would   296 freely impart at meeting  and advising me to put it  without loss of time  into the hands of that manager  who had the best company  for he himself was quite uncertain  whether or not he should be engaged that winter —I was a good deal alarmed at this last part of his letter  and advised about it with a friend  who told me  it was a plain indication of Mr  Marmozet s desire to be rid of his promise  that his pretended uncertainty about acting next winter  was no other than a scandalous evasion  for to his certain knowledge  he was already engaged  or at least  in terms with Mr  Vandal  and that his design was to disappoint me  in favour of a new comedy  which he had purchased of the author  and intended to bring upon the stage for his own advantage —In short  my dear Sir  this person  who  I must own  is of a very sanguine complexion  handled the moral character of Mr  Marmozet with such severity  that I began to suspect him of some particular prejudice  and put myself upon my guard against his insinuations —I ought to crave pardon for this tedious narration of trivial circumstances  which  however interesting they may be to me  must certainly be very dry and insipid to the ear of one unconcerned in the affair —But I understand the meaning of your looks  and will proceed —Well  Sir  Mr  Marmozet  upon his return to town  treated me with uncommon complaisance  and invited me to his lodgings  where he proposed to communicate his remarks  which I confess were more unfavourable than I expected  but I answered his objections  and  as I thought  brought him over to my opinion  for  on the whole  he signified the highest approbation of the performance —In the course of our dispute    297 I was not a little surprized to find this poor gentleman s memory so treacherous as to let him forget what he had said to me  before he went out of town  in regard to Earl Sheerwit s opinion of my play  which he now professed himself ignorant of  and I was extremely mortified at hearing from his own mouth  that his interest with Mr  Vandal was so very low  as to be insufficient of itself  to bring a new piece upon the stage  I then begged his advice  and he counselled me to apply to Earl Sheerwit for a message in my favour to the manager  who would not presume to refuse any thing recommended by so great a man  and he was so kind as to promise to second this message with all his power —I had immediate recourse to the worthy gentlewoman my friend already mentioned  who opened the channels of her conveyance with such expedition  that in few days  I had a promise of the message  provided I could assure myself of Mr  Vandal s being uningaged to any other  for his Lordship did not chuse to condescend so far  until he should understand that there was a probability  at least  of succeeding  at the same time in which I was blessed with this piece of news  I was startled at another
