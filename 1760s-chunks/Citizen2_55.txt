the whole is but an imposture   There is scarce any country how rude or incultivated soever  where the inhabitants are not possessed of some peculiar secrets  either in nature or art  which might be transplanted with success  in Siberian Tartary  for instance  the natives extract a strong spirit from milk  which is a secret probably unknown to the chymists of Europe  In the most savage parts of India  they are possessed of the secret of dying vegetable substances scarlet  and of refining lead into a metal which  for hardness and colour  is little inferior to silver  not one of which secrets but would in Europe make a man s fortune  The power of the Asiatics in producing winds  or bringing down rain  the Europeans are apt to treat as fabulous    170 because they have no instances of the like nature among themselves  but they would have treated the secrets of gunpowder  and the mariner s compass  in the same manner  had they been told the Chinese used such arts before the invention was common with themselves at home   Of all the English philosophers I most reverence Bacon  that great and hardy genius  he it is who allows of secrets yet unknown  who  undaunted by the seeming difficulties that oppose  prompts human curiosity to examine every part of nature  and even exhorts man to try whether he cannot subject the tempest  the thunder  and even earthquakes to human controll  O did a man of his daring spirit  of his genius  penetration  and learning travel to those countries which have been visited only by the superstitious and mercenary  what might not mankind expect  how would he enlighten the regions to which he travelled  And what a variety of knowledge and useful improvement would he not bring back in exchange   There is probably no country so barbarous  that would not disclose all it knew  if it received from the traveller equivalent information  and I am apt to think  that a person  who was ready to give more knowledge than he received  would be welcome wherever he came  All his care in travelling should only be to suit his intellectual banquet to the people with whom he conversed  he should not attempt to teach the unlettered Tartar astronomy  nor yet instruct the polite Chinese in the ruder arts of subsistence  he should endeavour to improve the Barbarian in the secrets of living comfortably  and the inhabitant of a more refined country in   171 the speculative pleasures of science  How much more nobly would a philosopher thus employed spend his time  than by sitting at home earnestly intent upon adding one star more to his catalogue  or one monster more to his collection  or still  if possible  more triflingly sedulous in the incatenation of fleas  or the sculpture of a cherry stone   I never consider this subject  without being surprized how none of those societies so laudably established in England for the promotion of arts and learning  have never thought of sending one of their members into the most eastern parts of Asia  to make what discoveries he was able  To be convinced of the utility of such an undertaking  let them but read the relations of their own travellers  It will be there found  that they are as often deceived themselves  as they attempt to deceive others  The merchants tells us perhaps the price of different commodities  the methods of baling them up  and the properest manner for an European to preserve his health in the country  The missioner  on the other hand  informs us  with what pleasure the country to which he was sent embraced christianity  and the numbers he converted  what methods he took to keep Lent in a region where there was no fish  or the shifts he made to celebrate the rites of his religion  in places where there was neither bread nor wine  such accounts  with the usual appendage of marriages and funerals  inscriptions  rivers  and mountains  make up the whole of an European traveller s diary  but as to all the secrets of which the inhabitants are possessed  those are universally attributed to magic  and when the traveller can give no other account of the wonders he sees performed    172 he very contentedly ascribes them to the power of the devil   It was an usual observation of Boyle  the English chymist  that if every artist would but discover what new observations occurred to him in the exercise of his trade  philosophy would thence gain innumerable improvements  It may be observed  with still greater justice  that if the useful knowledge of every country  howsoever barbarous  was gleaned by a judicious observer  the advantages would be inestimable  Are there not even in Europe  many useful inventions known or practised  but in one place  The instrument  as an example  for cutting down corn in Germany  is much more handy and expeditious  in my opinion  than the sickle used in England  The cheap and expeditious manner of making vinegar without previous fermentation  is known only in a part of France  If such discoveries therefore  remain still to be known at home  what funds of knowledge might not be collected  in countries yet unexplored  or only passed through by ignorant travellers in hasty caravans   The caution with which foreigners are
