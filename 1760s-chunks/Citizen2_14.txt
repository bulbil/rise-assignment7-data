it  I would not chuse  says a French philosopher  to see an old post pulled up  with which I had been long acquainted  A mind long habituated to a certain set of objects  insensibly becomes fond of seeing them  visits them from habit  and parts from them with reluctance  from hence proceed the avarice of the old in every kind of possession  They love the world and all that it produces  they love life and all its advantages  not because it gives them pleasure  but because they have known it long   Chinvang  the Chaste  ascending the throne of China  commanded that all who were unjustly detained in prison  during the preceding reigns  should be set free  Among the number who came to thank their deliverer on this occasion  there appeared a majestic old man  who  falling at the emperor s feet  addressed him as follows   Great father of China  behold a wretch  now eighty five years old  who was shut up in a dungeon at the age of twenty two  I was imprisoned  though a stranger to crime  or without being even confronted by my accusers  I have now lived in solitude and darkness for more than fifty years  and am grown familiar with distress  As yet dazzled with the splendour of that sun to which you have restored me  I have been wandring the streets to find some friend that would assist  or relieve  or remember me  but my friends  my family  and relations    39 are all dead  and I am forgotten  Permit me then  O Chinvang  to wear out the wretched remains of life in my former prison  the walls of my dungeon are to me more pleasing than the most splendid palace  I have not long to live  and shall be unhappy except I spend the rest of my days where my youth was passed  in that prison from whence you were pleased to release me   The old man s passion for confinement is similar to that we all have for life  We are habituated to the prison  we look round with discontent  are displeased with the abode  and yet the length of our captivity only encreases our fondness for the cell  The trees we have planted  the houses we have built  or the posterity we have begotten  all serve to bind us closer to earth  and embitter our parting  Life sues the young like a new acquaintance  the companion  as yet unexhausted  is at once instructive and amusing   tis company pleases  yet for all this it is but little regarded  To us  who are declined in years  life appears like an old friend  its jests have been anticipated in former conversation  it has no new story to make us smile  no new improvement with which to surprize  yet still we love it  destitute of every agreement still we love it  husband the wasting treasure with encreased frugality  and feel all the poignancy of anguish in the fatal separation   Sir Philip Mordaunt was young  beautiful  sincere  brave  an Englishman  He had a complete fortune of his own  and the love of the king his master  which was equivalent to riches  Life opened all her treasure before him  and promised a long succession of future happiness  He came  tasted of the entertainment  but was disgusted even in   40 in the beginning  He professed an aversion to living  was tired of walking round the same circle  had tried every enjoyment  and found them all grow weaker at every repetition   If life be in youth so displeasing  cried he to himself  what will it appear when age comes on  if it be at present indifferent  sure it will then be execrable  This thought embittered every reflection  till  at last  with all the serenity of perverted reason  he ended the debate with a pistol  Had this self deluded man been apprized  that existence grows more desirable to us the longer we exist  he would have then faced old age without shrinking  he would have boldly dared to live  and served that society  by his future assiduity  which he basely injured by his desertion  Adieu   LETTER LXXI  From Lien Chi Altangi  to Fum Hoam  first president of the Ceremonial Academy  at Pekin  in China   IN reading the news papers here  I have reckoned up not less than twenty five great men  seventeen very great men  and nine very extraordinary men in less than the compass of half a year  These  say the gazattes  are the men that posterity are to gaze at with admiration  these the names that fame will be employed in holding up for the astonishment of succeeding ages  Let me see — forty six great men in half a year  amounts just to ninety two in a year  —I wonder how posterity will be able to remember them all  or whether the people  in future times  will have any other business to mind  but that of getting the catalogue by heart     41Does the mayor of a corporation make a speech  he is instantly set down for a great man  Does a pedant digest his common place book into a folio  he quickly
