that of love  he longed to behold a prince who seemed to have all the   virtues comprized in him  and whose very thoughts  as well as actions    might be looked upon as super natural       He is  however  greatly to be pitied  said the baron de la Valiere  that   the wars he is engaged in  and which  in all probability will be of long   continuance  hinders him from the possession of the most amiable   princess in the world  and I dare answer  at least if I may credit those   about her  she wishes he were of a less martial disposition       He will be the more worthy of her  cried Horatio interrupting him  and   the immortal fame of his actions be a sufficient attonement for all the   years of expectation that may be its purchase       From the time Horatio had this discourse with the baron  the king of   Sweden was ever uppermost in his thoughts  he had always reflected that    in the station he then was  it would be impossible to obtain any more of   mademoiselle Charlotta than her heart  at least while the baron de   Palfoy lived  and that a thousand accidents might deprive him of all   hopes of ever being more happy  but  said he to himself  were I among   the number of those who attend this hero in his martial exploits  I   might at least have an opportunity of proving how far fortune would   befriend me   who knows but I might be able to do something which might   engage that just and generous monarch to raise me to a degree capable of   avowing my pretensions even to her father  and the same blessed day that   joined our principals  might also make me blessed in the possession of   my dear Charlotta       With these ideas did he often flatter himself  but the manner in which   he should accomplish his desires was yet doubtless to him  The chevalier   St  George treated him with so much kindness  that he had no room to   doubt his having a great share in his favour  and was fully perswaded    that if he communicated his intentions to him  he would vouchsafe to   give him letters of recommendation to a prince who was to be his   brother in law  but this he feared to ask  lest it should be looked upon   as ingratitude in him to desire to leave a court where he had been so   graciously received  and had many favours  besides the perquisites of   his post  heaped upon him  not only by the chevalier himself  but also   by the queen and princess  who  following the example of the late king    behaved with a kind of natural affection to all the English       He sometimes communicated his sentiments on this head to mademoiselle   Charlotta  who was too discreet not to allow the justness of them  and   well knew  that in the station her lover now was  they never could be on   any terms with each other than those they were at present  her reason    therefore  and the advantage of her love  made her sometimes wish he   would follow the dictates of so laudable an ambition  but then the   dangers he must inevitably be exposed to in following a monarch who   never set any bounds to his courage  and the thoughts how long it might   possibly be before she saw him again  alarmed all her tenderness  and he   had the satisfaction of seeing the tears stand in her eyes whenever they   had any discourse of this nature  and tho  her words assured him that it   was her opinion he could not take a more ready way to raise his own   fortune  yet her looks at the same time made him plainly see how much   she would suffer in his taking that step       Many reasons  both for and against following his inclination in this   point  presented themselves to him  and he had no sooner  as he thought    determined for the one  than the other rose with double vehemence and   overthrew the former  In this fluctuating situation of mind did he   remain for some time  and perhaps had done so much longer  had not an   accident happened which proved decisive  and indeed left him no other   party to take than that he afterwards did       Charlotta  being now entirely mistress of herself  gave him frequent   meetings in the Tuilleries  judging it safer to converse with him there   than at the house of any person  whom  in such a case  must be the   confidante of the whole affair  whereas  if they were seen together in   the walks  it might be judged they met by accident  and not give any
