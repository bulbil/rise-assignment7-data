 nor could all Mr  Goodman and the ladies urged  persuade him to   dine with them that day       It must be acknowledged  that this positive refusal of every thing that   was desired of him  had not in it all that complaisance which might have   been expected from a person just come from among a people more famous   for their politeness than their sincerity       But he had his own reasons  which the family of Mr  Goodman as yet were   far from suspecting  which made him act in the manner he now did  and it   was not  in reality  the want of French breeding  but the want of true   old English resolution  that enforced this seeming negligence and   abruptness       After he was gone  Mr  Goodman went to Change  but was scarce entered   into the walk  where he had appointed to meet some merchants  when he   was accosted by two rough  ill looking fellows  who demanded his sword    and told him they had a writ against him  that he was their prisoner    and must go with them       Mr  Goodman  who had as little reason as any man living to suspect an   insult of this nature  only smiled  and told them they were mistaken in   the person   No  no   said one of them   we are right enough  if you are   Mr  Samuel Goodman     My name is Samuel Goodman   replied he   but I do   not know that it stands in any man s books for debt  but  pray     continued he   at whose suit am I arrested     At the suit of Mr  Oliver   Marplus   said the other officer   I have no dealings with any such   person   cried Mr  Goodman   nor even ever heard the name of him you   mention   They then told him it was his business to prove that  they did   but do their duty  and he must obey the writ  Mr  Goodman  on this    knowing they were not the persons with whom this matter should be   contested  readily went where they conducted him  which was to a house   belonging to him who appeared to be the principal of the two  As they   were coming off Change  he bade his coachman drive his chariot home  and   tell his lady  that he believed he should not dine with her that day    but he kept his footman with him  to send on what messages he should   find convenient       The officer  knowing his condition  and not doubting but he should have   a handsome present for civility money  used him with a great deal of   respect when he had got him into his house  and  on his desiring to be   informed of the lawyer s name employed in the action  he immediately   told him  and also for what sum he was arrested  which was no less than   two thousand five hundred and seventy five pounds eight shillings   A   pretty parcel of money  truly   said Mr  Goodman   I wonder in what   dream I contracted this debt   He then called for pen  ink  and paper    and wrote a line to his lawyer in the Temple  desiring him to go to the   other who they said was concerned against him  and find out the truth of   this affair       The honest old gentleman  having sent this letter by his servant    called for something to eat  and was extremely facetious and pleasant   with the officers  not doubting but that what had happened was   occasioned through some mistake or other  and should immediately be   discharged when the thing was enquired into  but his present good humour   was changed into one altogether the reverse  when his own lawyer    accompanied by him who was engaged for his adversary  came to him  and   told him there was no remedy but to give bail  that the suit commenced   against him was on account of a bond given by Lady Mellasin to Mr    Oliver Marplus  some few days previous to her marriage  It is hard to   say  whether surprize or rage was most predominant in the soul of this   much injured husband  at so shocking a piece of intelligence  He   demanded to see the bond  which request being granted  he found it not    as he at first flattered himself  a forgery  but signed with his wife s   own hand  and witnessed by Mrs  Prinks  her woman  and another person   whom he knew not       It is certain that no confusion ever exceeded that of Mr
