and lying in wait for her looks  did homage with my eyes —She seemed to approve my declaration  by the complacency of her aspect  and I was so transported with the discovery  that more than once  I was on the point of making up to her  and disclosing the throbbings of my heart in person  had not that profound veneration which her presence always inspired  restrained the unseasonable impulse —My whole powers being engrossed in this manner  it may be easily imagined how ill I entertained Miss Snapper  on whom I could not now turn my   208 eyes  without making comparisons very little to her advantage —It was not even in my power to return distinct answers to the questions she asked from time to time  so that she could not help observing my absence of behaviour  and having a turn  for observation  watched my glances  and tracing them to the divine object  discovered the cause of my disorder —That she might  however  be convinced of the truth of her conjecture  she began to interrogate me with regard to Narcissa  and notwithstanding all my endeavours to disguise my sentiments  perceived my attachment by my confusion —Upon which  she assumed a stateliness of behaviour  and sat silent during the remaining part of the entertainment —At any other time I should have been prodigiously alarmed at her suspicion  but at that instant  I was elevated by my passion above every other consideration —The mistress of my soul having retired with her brother  I discovered so much uneasiness at my situation  that Miss Snapper proposed to go home  and while I conducted her to a chair  told me she had too great a regard for me to keep me any longer in torment —I feigned ignorance of her meaning  and having seen her safely at her lodgings  took my leave  and went home in an exstasy  where I disclosed every thing that had happened to my confident and humble servant Strap  who did not relish the accident so well as I expected  and observed  that a bird in hand is worth two in the bush —   But however  said he  you know best—you know best  —  Next day as I went to the Bath  in hopes of seeing or hearing some tidings of my fair enslaver  I was met by a gentlewoman  who having looked hard at me  cried    O Christ  Mr  Random      209 Surprised at this exclamation  I examined the countenance of the person who spoke  and immediately recognized my old sweet heart and fellow sufferer Miss Williams     I was mightily pleased to find this unfortunate woman under such a decent appearance  professed my joy at seeing her well  and desired to know where I should have the pleasure of her conversation  She was as heartily rejoiced at the apparent easiness of my fortune  and gave me to know that she  as yet  had no habitation that she could properly call her own  but would wait on me at any place I would please to appoint—Understanding that she was disengaged for the present  I shewed her the way to my own lodgings  where  after a very affectionate salutation  she informed me of her being very happy in the service of a young lady  to whom she was recommended by a former mistress deceased  into whose family she had introduced herself by the honest deceit she had concerted  while she lived with me in the garret at London—She then expressed a vehement desire to be acquainted with the vicissitudes of my life since we parted  and ascribed her curiosity to the concern she had for my interest—I forthwith gratified her request  and when I described my situation in Sussex  perceived her to attend to my story with particular eagerness  She interrupted me when I had finished that period  with    good God  is it possible  —  and then begged I would be so good as to continue my relation  which I did as briefly as I could  burning with impatience to know the cause of her surprize  about which I had already formed a very interesting conjecture—Having therefore brought my adventures down to the present day  she seemed very much affected with   210 the different circumstances of my fortune  and saying with a smile  she believed my distresses were now at a period  proceeded to inform me  that the lady whom she served was no other than the charming Narcissa  who had honoured her with her confidence for some time —that in consequence of that trust  she had often repeated the story of John Brown  with great admiration and regard  that she loved to dwell upon the particulars of his character  and did not scruple to own a tender approbation of his flame—I became delirious with this piece of intelligence  strained Miss Williams in my embrace  called her the angel of my happiness  and acted such extravagancies  that she would have been convinced of my sincerity  had not my honour been clear enough to her before—As soon as I was in a condition to yield attention  she described the present situation of her mistress  who had no sooner come home the night before  than she closeted her  and in a rapture of joy  gave her to know that she had seen me at the ball  where I appeared in the character
