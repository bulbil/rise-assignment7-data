You are extremely kind  not to stand on Form  You can never write out of Time  I may  Your Letters always give me Pleasure  mine cannot afford you any  yet are  at this Time  a higher Compliment  than when they were  perhaps  more entertaining  I hate Writing  because I know I cannot write  However  I would not have you imagine  that I think this Self mortification too high a Price for your Correspondence  I am only concerned  that I have not an equivalent Return to make  But this be   193 assured of  that what I want in Expression  is made up in Friendship and Affection for you  Let my Actions supply the Place of Words  and prove me  Ever Your s   LETTER CVII   I Received a Letter from you  pleading your Incapacity of writing  in the same Stile that Jeremy is said to exclaim against Wit in Love for Love  which is our Comedy also  But you must get somebody else  indeed almost any body else  to make your Apology on that Head  for you can t avoid betraying yourself in your Defence  In short  my charming Girl  you can never hope to be excused on this Subject  for nothing but your Writing ill shall make me forgive your Neglect   I am sorry for Mrs  — s Behaviour to you  but am pleased to find you mention it as becomes you  more in Concern  than Picque  which truly shews in you more Generosity and Virtue  than she was ever capable of  There is  in her Censures of you  a vast Air of the old Maid  and tho  poor Mr  —  for his Sins  has rid her of that Reproach  yet the terrible Apprehensions she some Time laboured under of that forlorn State  have so soured her Morals  that she wants nothing—but Wit—to be an excellent   194 Satirist  The little Meannesses  she has been guilty of  in mentioning your Name  convince me of the Truth of my Remarks about her  in a late Letter  for her Behaviour really shews more Picque for herself  than friendly Concern for you  But—fare her well—for a Pseudo Maga   Notwithstanding what you say against poor Pope  I am very well satisfied  he has said many Things of his own  nay many Things are his own  tho  they  perhaps  were said before  Now I am upon this Subject of Criticism  I can t help observing to you  that my Thought of a divided Heart  and Suckling s of a broken Looking Glass  being compared to each other  was owing to a small Error only of mistaking Multiplication for Division     I shall  by the End of this Week  have finished the earliest and the largest Sowing of any Man in this County  Sixty three Acres of Corn  exactly one Third of my Demesne  unploughed when you was here  and all limed  at eighty Barrels to an Acre  After so much Labour and Fatigue  I think I owe myself some Relaxation  and shall then post up to London  to see what Harvest you are making there  which I shall share with you  in order to provoke you to make Reprisals on mine here next Summer  I am  my dearest   Ever Your s  Henry     195  LETTER CVIII  HENRY to FRANCES   I Am in Haste to dispatch my little Voluntier  before the Post comes in  lest your Letter should not leave me Room to say any Thing of my own  for your Writings are generally so replete with Matter and Sentiment  that it takes me up the full Extent of a Letter  merely to answer your s  so that there is hardly a Thought  or Expression  I can truly call my own  except when I subscribe myself   Your Lover  and your Friend   for that is a Sentiment  which proceeds so naturally from my Heart  that it would frequently occur  whether you had wrote to me or no     I am well aware  how far short these detached Essays will appear of the Papers of our regular Correspondence  for this remarkable Reason  that  as natural Philosophers affirm the Statue to be originally in the Stone  the Hammer and Chissel only clearing of the Rubbish  so speculative Wits say  that all Arts and Sciences are innate in the Mind  and that an ingenious Querist may deduce the most abstruse Theorems of Mathematics  Philosophy  or Ethics  from the Answers of a rational Respondent  tho  ever so illiterate  Our epistolary Converse I look upon  in this Socratical Light  insomuch that  if I say any Thing  which deserves to be taken   196 Notice of  I may rather be said to have the Happiness to be inspired  than to boast the Merit of Wit  I have  several Times  since we founded the Amourette  or Paraclete  lamented that  at your poetical Baptism  you had not taken upon you Le Nom d  Amour of Heloise  but  upon Reflection  I think it better became that Person  who was lately stiled so  as she indeed needed many Things to learn  but   You
