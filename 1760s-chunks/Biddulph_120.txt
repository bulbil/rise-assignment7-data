in poverty too  No  lady V——  no  I am not such an abandoned wretch  All I desire now of your ladyship is  to tell my wife that I beg her forgiveness  and request she will take care of our two children  though the scanty pittance that her mother’s scrupulous nicety retained for her will hardly enable her to do it  but while lady Bidulph lives  I believe she will not see them want   He uttered all this with so much eagerness  that we never once attempted to interrupt him   As I did not know then of the loss of your cause  I was surprized to hear him speak of his circumstances being so desperate  and really feared his head was turned  But my lord soon explained the matter  by saying  he had heard that morning of the Issue of his law suit  yet still hoped  that matters were not so bad as he represented them to be  He then told Mr Arnold  he was extremely glad to find that his wife had recovered his good opinion  adding  that he always had the    highest one of your virtue  It amazes me  Mr Arnold  said I  that you ever could entertain a doubt of it  So it does me now  madam  said Mr Arnold  but I have been for this year past in a dream  a horrid delirium  from which that vile sorceress  who brought it on me  has but just now rouzed me   I wanted to draw Mr Arnold to this point  Have you heard any thing of her since she left you  Sir  said I   He drew a letter out of his pocket  and without answering me  put it into my hands  and desired me to read it  then rose off his chair  and walked about the room   My lord and I read Mrs Gerrarde’s letter together  we were both curious to see it  Mr Faulkland having mentioned it in his correspondence  Mr Arnold  said I  returning it to him  without any such proof as this  I believe nobody that knows your lady would think her guilty  nor could I ever entertain so bad an opinion of Mr Faulkland  I have known him from his boyish days  and never had reason to believe him capable of a dishonourable action   I believe him innocent  as to this  answered Mr Arnold  but you cannot conceive the pains that were taken by that vile woman to make me think otherwise  neither would her retracting all she said now work so much on me  as other corroborating circumstances  her running away with the very man  of whom she raised my jealousy  after having plundered me of almost every thing I had to bestow  does not look like a sudden resolution  the scheme must have been concerted for some time  and Faulkland  I suppose  was her paramour  at the very time she so basely slandered Mrs Arnold  for I am not so blind  even to the personal charms of my wife  as to imagine the greatest inconstant would grow tired of her in so short a time   Why  I must own  said my lord  that is a natural inference  which  joined to the perfidy and falshood of Mrs Gerrarde  puts it out of dispute  that she traduced Mr Faulkland and your wife  merely to gain her own wicked ends  one part of which I am inclined to think she confesses in her letter  that is to say  to have you intirely in her own hands  though not for the reason she there gives  Her other motive  I think  now plainly appears by the consequence  she thought  if you were jealous of your wife  you would hardly suspect her with the same person  whose visits  to my knowlege  were pretty frequent at her house  Then  said I   throwing my weight into the scale  the unobjectionable character of Mrs Arnold  her pious education  her modest and affectionate behaviour to you for so long a time  and the    recluse life that she had led with her mother since you parted  makes the thought of any ill in her quite incredible   Lady V——  said your husband  impatiently  I am as conscious of it all as you can possibly wish me  I know I am a blind infatuated monster  What can you say more  Faulkland  I thank you for ridding me of such a pest  Oh  that you had taken her before I was so curst as to see her face  If you had  I should not now be the undone wretch I am  My lord  my lady  will you do me the favour to tell my wife and lady Bidulph  how contrite I am  and he laid his hand on his breast   while I had any thing to offer her besides repentance  I could have thrown myself at her feet for pardon  and conjured her to have returned to my bosom  and to her own deserted house  from whence my madness drove her  but I have now no house to bring her to  and do not desire even to see her face   His manner was so vehement  that I really feared
