ourselves assailed by a bold piratical  vessel  and threatened with a severe captivity  The hostile intentions  of our adversary were but too plainly discovered  as he bore down upon  us  Our force was instantly collected  and we resolved to defend our  liberty with due spirit  Tortured at the thought of being prevented from  pursuing my design  I raved in all the wildness of frenzy and  desperation  which the good Les Roches endeavoured to restrain  himself  equally resolute  but inspired with a more deliberate and rational  courage  No sooner had the enemy closed with us  than this gallant  Lord  earnest to prevent me in the pursuit of danger  leaped on board  his vessel  was followed by a few attendants  and there maintained a  bloody and unequal conflict  We prest forward  earnest to second this  bold attack  the pirate was alarmed at our numbers and our resolution   when  suddenly  the violence of the surge separated our vessels  and as  we endeavoured to regain our former station  anxious for the rescue of  our companions  we were shocked with the view of the pirate flying  before us  His vessel was of quicker sail  and his mariners more expert   He left us in rage and anguish  uttering fruitless execrations  and  straining our limbs in fruitless efforts to regain our captive friends   In the bitterness  of grief and disappointment  I resolved to continue the pursuit  if  happily some favourable incident might bring the enemy once more into  our reach  and for a while the pursuit was continued  But the storm was  loud  and my followers too sensible of their danger  They forced me to  make towards land  and  after much hazard and difficulty  we were at  length disembarked on the southern coast of England —We recounted our  late adventure to the inhabitants of the coast  who well knew the  pirate we described  and had oftentimes suffered by his depredations   They informed us that his name was William de Morisco  a bold  adventurer  who had of late frequently infested their dwellings  and  probably  ere long  might alarm them by another descent  that his  exactions had ever been severe  but that his nature  rude as it was   discovered no wanton cruelty  no malicious thirst for blood  that an  honourable ransom might prevail upon him to set our friends at liberty   I was comforted by this intelligence  and waited for a time  in hopes of  some favourable opportunity of recovering Les Roches  but no vessel  appeared  no intelligence was received     Unable to support this delay  I resolved once more to seek the enemy at  sea  My followers I knew would prove averse to such an attempt  and the  occasion demanded more skilful mariners  and a vessel more compleatly  appointed than our s  which by this time had felt the severity of winds  and seas  I therefore formed the bold design of applying for assistance  directly at the English court  A young King  jealous of his honour   could not be unmoved at the insults offered to his territory by this  obscure adventurer  he must readily favour the generous purpose of  pursuing and engageing him  and  if Lord Salisbury hath now regained  his native country  he cannot be less zealous to rescue his friend  he  must effectually aid my endeavours —Thus I reasoned  and  leaving a part  of my retinue on the coast to treat for the ransom  of our friends   if the pirate should appear  I proceeded to the court  of England  where jousts and tournaments were prepared for the  entertainment of the King  now recovering from a tedious sickness  In  these I engaged  nor was I disgraced  or my attendants unnoticed  Henry  vouchsafed his attention to the stranger  and received me with a  princely welcome  I called myself a young Lord of one of those provinces  of France that acknowledged the English jurisdiction  and declared the  whole story of my adventure on the voyage towards England  The King was  duly affected with indignation  commended the gallant resolution I  expressed of seeking the pirate  and readily promised to entrust the  chastisement of this insolent plunderer to my command     Lord Hubert  whom I soon found to be principal in the confidence of his  master  echoed the sentiments of Henry  he frequently held converse  with me  and enquired much about the affairs of my province  Discourse  of the late wars naturally introduced the name of Salisbury  I sighed   and Hubert hastily demanded if I could say aught of the fortunes of this  Lord  The melancholy air which I assumed  redoubled his attention  I  told him that Lord William had landed in France  had been pursued by the  fury of his unjust enemies  fled with a noble maid whose father had  deeply snared in his calamities  and  since he was not by this time  returned to his native country  I seared for both —Hubert  with an  impatience and violence to me unaccountable  hastily interrupted me  by  declaring that
