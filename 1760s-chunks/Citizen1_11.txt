points out the path to happiness  Could you   33 think it  they adore a wicked divinity  they fear him and they worship him  they imagine him a malicious being  ready to injure and ready to be appeased  The men and women assemble at midnight in a hut  which serves for a temple  A priest stretches himself on the ground  and all the people pour forth the most horrid cries  while drums and timbrels swell the infernal concert  After this dissonance  miscalled music  has continued about two hours  the priest rises from the ground  assumes an air of inspiration  grows big with the inspiring daemon  and pretends to a skill in futurity   In every country  my friend  the bonzes  the brachmans  and the priests deceive the people  all reformations begin from the laity  the priests point us out the way to heaven with their fingers  but stand still themselves  nor seem to travel towards the country in view   The customs of this people correspond to their religion  they keep their dead for three days on the same bed where the person died  after which they bury him in a grave moderately deep  but with the head still uncovered  Here for several days they present him different sorts of meats  which  when they perceive he does not consume  they fill up the grave  and desist from desiring him to eat for the future  How  how can mankind be guilty of such strange absurdity  to entreat a dead body already putrid to partake of the banquet  Where  I again repeat it  is human reason  not only some men  but whole nations  seem divested of its illumination  Here we observe a whole country adoring a divinity through fear  and attempting to feed the dead  These are their most   34 serious and most religious occupations  are these men rational  or are not the apes of Borneo more wise   Certain I am  O thou instructor of my youth  that without philosophers  without some few virtuous men  who seem to be of a different nature from the rest of mankind  without such as these the worship of a wicked divinity would surely be established over every part of the earth  Fear guides more to their duty than gratitude  for one man who is virtuous from the love of virtue  from the obligation which he thinks he lies under to the giver of all  there are ten thousand who are good only from their apprehensions of punishment  Could these last be persuaded  as the Epicureans were  that heaven had no thunders in store for the villain  they would no longer continue to acknowledge subordination  or thank that being who gave them existence  Adieu   LETTER XI  To the same   FROM such a picture of nature in primeval simplicity  tell me  my much respected friend  are you in love with fatigue and solitude  Do you sigh for the severe frugality of the wandering Tartar  or regret being born amidst the luxury and dissimulation of the polite  Rather tell me  has not every kind of life vices peculiarly its own  Is it not a truth  that refined countries have more vices  but those not so terrible  barbarous nations few  and they of the most hideous complexion  Perfidy and fraud are the vices of civilized nations  cr•dulity and violence those of the inhabitants   35 of the desert  Does the luxury of the one produce half the evils of the inhumanity of the other  Certainly those philosophers  who declaim against luxury have but little understood its benefits  they seem insensible  that to luxury we owe not only the greatest part of our knowledge  but even of our virtues   It may sound fine in the mouth of a declaimer when he talks of subduing our appetites  of teaching every sense to be content with a bare sufficiency  and of supplying only the wants of nature  but is there not more satisfaction in indulging those appetites  if with innocence and safety  than in restraining them  Am not I better pleased in enjoyment than in the sullen satisfaction of thinking that I can live without enjoyment  The more various our artificial necessities  the wider is our circle of pleasure  for all pleasure consists in obviating necessities as they rise  luxury  therefore  as it encreases our wants  encreases our capacity for happiness   Examine the history of any country remarkable for opulence and wisdom  you will find they would never have been wise had they not been first luxurious  you will find poets  philosophers  and even patriots  marching in luxury s train  The reason is obvious  we then only are curious after knowledge when we find it connected with sensual happiness  The senses ever point out the way  and reflection comments upon the discovery  Inform a native of the desert of Kobi  of the exact measure of the parallax of the moon  he finds no satisfaction at all in the information  he wonders how any could take such pains  and lay out such treasures in order to solve so useless a difficulty    36 but connect it with his happiness  by shewing that it improves navigation  that by such an investigation he may have a warmer coat  a better gun  or a finer knife  and
