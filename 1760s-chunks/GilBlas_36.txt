my subterraneous paradise  Take it for all in all  said I  there were fewer grievances than in this dungeon  I was hail fellow well met with the banditti  I bandied about my jokes with the best of them  and lived on the sweet hope of an escape  whereas my innocence here will only be a passport to the galleys       CH  XIII     The lucky means by which Gil Blas escaped from prison  and his travels afterwards   WHILE I passed the hours in tickling my fancy with my own gay thoughts  my adventures  word for word  as I had set my hand to them  were current about the town  The people wanted to make a show of me  One after another  there they came  peeping in at a little window of my prison  not too capacious of daylight  and when they had looked about them  off they went  This raree show was a novelty  Since my commitment  there had not been a living creature at that window  which looked into a court where silence and horror kept guard  This gave me to understand that I was become the town talk  and I knew not whether to divine good or evil from the omen   One of my first visitors was the little chorister of Mondognedo  who had a fellow feeling with me for the rack  and an equally light pair of heels  I knew him at once  and he had no qualms about acknowledging me as an acquaintance  We exchanged a kind greeting  then compared notes since our separation  I was obliged to relate my adventures in due form and order  The chorister  on his part  told me what had happened in the inn at Cacabelos  between the muleteer and the bride  after we had taken to our heels in a panic  Then with a friendly assurance at parting  he promised to leave no stone unturned for my release  His companions of mere curiosity testified their pity for my misfortune  assuring me that they would lend a helping hand to the little chorister  and do their utmost to procure my freedom   They were no worse than their word  The corregidor was applied to in my favour  who  no longer doubtful of my innocence  above all when he had heard the chorister s story  came three weeks afterwards into my cell  Gil Blas  said he  I never stand shilly  shally  begone  you are free  you may take yourself off whenever you please  But  tell me  if you were carried to the forest  could you not discover the subterraneous retreat  No  sir  replied I  as I only entered in the night  and made my escape before day break  it would be impossible to fix upon the spot  Thereupon the magistrate withdrew  assuring me that the gaoler should be ordered to give me free egress  In fact  the very next moment the turnkey came into my dungeon  followed by one of his outriding establishment with a bundle of clothes under his arm  They both of them stripped me with the utmost solemnity  and without uttering a single syllable  of my doublet and breeches  which had the honour to be made of a bettermost cloth almost new  then  having rigged me in an old frock  they shoved me out of their hospitable mansion by the shoulders   The taking I was in to see myself so ill equipped  acted as a cooler to the usual transport of prisoners at recovering their liberty  I was tempted to escape from the town without delay  that I might withdraw from the gaze of the people  whose prying eyes I could not encounter but with pain  My gratitude  however  got the better of my diffidence  I went to thank the little chorister  to whom I was so much obliged  He could not help chuckling when he saw me  That is your trim  is it  said he  As far as I see  you cannot complain that your case has not been sifted to the bottom  I have nothing to say against the laws of my country  replied I  they are as just as need be  I only wish their officers would take after them  They might have spared me my suit of clothes  I have paid for them over and over again  I am quite of your mind  rejoined he  but they would tell you that these are little formalities of old standing  which cannot be dispensed with  What  you are foolish enough to suppose  for instance  that your horse has been restored to its right owner  Not a word of it  if you please  the beast is at this present in the stables of the register  where it has been impounded as a witness to be brought into court  if the poor gentleman comes off with the crupper  he will be so much in pocket  But let us change the subject  What is your plan  What do you mean to do with yourself  I have an inclination  said I  to take the road for Burgos  I may light on my rescued lady  she will give me a little ready cash  I shall then buy a new short cassock  and betake myself to
