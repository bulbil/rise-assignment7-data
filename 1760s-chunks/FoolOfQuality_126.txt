     I found seventeen guineas in the fore mentioned paper  a most   seasonable  and yet a most unacceptable supply  as I feared  from   the generosity of Longfield s temper  that it contained very nearly   the whole of his possessions      My wife s distemper turned out a tertian ague   and at length   settled into a certain rheumatism  that principally affected her arms   and hands  and thereby prevented her earning any subsistence for   herself or her infant      It was now upwards of four months since Mr  Longfield had left   us  Our finances were again reduced to about two guineas  I was    however  confident of a supply in the tutorship promised me by   Mr  Marfelt   and I dressed in the best I could  and waited upon   him  I was concerned to find the family in black  But when   Mr  Marfelt himself appeared  and told me  with a voice interrupted   with sighs  that his only son  my pupil in expectance  had been   lately carried off by a malignant smallpox  my mourning passed all   shows of sorrow      I took my leave with a dejection and absence of mind that forgot   there was any road left for me upon earth  I went  I knew not   where  a way that led from home  I saw nothing but the labyrinth   within my own soul   and from thence I could perceive neither   outlet nor escape      My eyes at last were opened  and I perceived that I was now   much further from my lodgings than when I set out from Mr    Marfelt s  I turned homeward as well as I could  fatigued in body    and with more than a mountain s weight upon my mind  On the   way  1 lifted up my eyes and rung my hands together in a kind of   agony  Bread   Bread   I cried inwardly  Merciful heaven  a   little  but a very little bread   My helpless wife   my helpless in    fant   a little pittance for them   I crave it in mercy   and  O save   me from beholding them famished  and gasping for a morsel of   sustenance before my face       As soon as I had crawled home  another weight was added to the   burden I already bore  A bailiff was in waiting  and my landlady    with an aspect as inexorable as iron  ordered me directly into   custody for the last quarter s rent  I was on this occasion obliged   to disburse my last two guineas  and further to deposit my wife s   gown as a security for the small remainder of rent and fees  I had   not now wherewithal to purchase a pennyworth of bread  that  like   the widow of Sarepta  my wife  my child  and I for this last time   might sit down together and eat before we died      I pretended to have forgotten somewhat  and again hastened out   of doors  The night had just fallen  and was still and gloomy    Rage  anguish  and despair gave me new strength and spirits   and   I turned fiercely down an unfrequented street  without any arms   save my fury and natural fangs  with which I determined  like the   maternal lioness  to rend subsistence for my young from the first   I should encounter      I perceived a man advancing at some distance  I hastened to   meet him   and  coming within a few paces Stand   I cried   pass         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  113     no further  Why  said he  with a fearless and benevolent voice    is there any thing wherein you desire I should serve you   O save   me  I replied  you must  you shall save me from the terrible   damnation of seeing my wife and infant perish before me  God    said he  sends you this by my hands  He sees your distress  but   disapproves your conduct  But  Clement  beware the third time     another offence like this would prove fatal to you      He spoke  and putting five guineas into my hand he instantly   slipped away   for such was my sudden astonishment and confusion   that I neither remarked nor saw what became of him  At length   I awaked as from a trance  I stepped up to a single lamp that   glimmered before me  and opening my hand I perceived that the   money which I held was gold  I hurried it into my pocket  and   turning back I began slow and pensive to move toward home
