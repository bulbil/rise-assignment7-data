impressions  together with the story of  intended murder  quickly reached their associates and spread  contagiously through their lines  While the anguish of confusion  shame   revenge  and disappointment  turned the aspect of Count Savourè to  ghastly pale  Yet  dreading the effects of this discovery  he soon  endeavoured to assume a look of composure and conscious integrity   exclaimed loudly against the infamous contrivance to destroy his  honour  and vehemently disavowed all intentions  but such as were fully  warranted by the laws of honourable war  This declaration silenced the  disorder in his troops  whose honest hearts could not  without regret   believe their general guilty of so black an attempt  he warmly repeated  his professions of innocence  and called for the soldier said to be  accomplice to him in whose breast Les Roches had plunged his sword  The  steady villain now stood forth  and assumed such a countenance as  effectually concealed his falsehood from every human eye  In the face of  both the armies  falling upon his knees and lifting up his eyes towards  heaven  he called on every saint to bear witness to his innocence  and  with horrid imprecations of the divine wrath  declared  that the only  orders of his Lord had been to treat their prisoner with respect and  care befitting an illustrious soldier  The constancy and the fair  appearance of ingenuous sincerity which accompanied these solemn  declarations  failed not of their desired effect  the troops of Count  Mal leon were fired with indignation  and joyed to find that their  commander had not acted unworthy of his own and of his country s  honour  they expressed a violent and tumultuous rage against the author  of this supposed calumny  whilst the adherents of the good Les Roches  were confounded and abased  Their eyes were turned upon me  with  suspicion and cold distrust  the boldest among them ventured to break  out into rude invectives  and to propose that I should be instantly  delivered up into the  hands of their brave countryman  whom I had so basely abused by my  horrid imputations  My enemy exulted  my friend  tho  still amply  satisfied of my truth and honour  was perplexed and grieved  and the  late of Salisbury seemed to depend on a single moment of tumult and  confusion  when with an effort of desperate resolution I stepped forth   and both parties hung upon me with looks of mute suspense and  expectation  I recounted plainly and clearly all my adventures  since  fortune had driven me to this unkind shore  my departure from the Abbey   with a full intention of resigning myself into the power of the Count   in order to preserve my friend  my being seized by the guards  and  detained on the spot where they had found me  instead of being conducted  to prison  or to the presence of Mal leon  a circumstance full of  suspicion  I described that dreadful night in all its horrors  when I  had been so wonderfully delivered from instant death  And if any doubt  remained of my truth and sincerity  I offered to make my solemn appeal  to heaven  There  said I  casting down my gage  I am ready to prove upon  that recreant Lord his vile falsehoods  and to assert my own innocence   and his dishonour  in single combat     Thou hast seen two gallant bands closing with each other  and for a  while maintaining the conflict in terrible suspense  pressed and  receding  recovering and pressing  by turns  until one mighty effort  determines the fortune of the day  and the whole tumultuous rout of  vanquished and victors  pour along the plain  Such had been the war of  pailions in these two parties  and such was now the force with which  both were hurried away  My bold challenge was received with an  universal acclamation by men too zealous votaries of warlike glory and  honour  to desire  that baseness and falsehood should be supported or  concealed  Shame forbad the Count to decline this hardy trial  and tho   appalled by conscious guilt  he accepted my defiance  Les Roches  whose  friendly cares never were diverted from me  demanded an interval  of two days to restore my harassed mind and body to their native vigour   and to prepare me for the encounter  This could not be refused  the  time  the place  and every previous circumstance was soon adjusted as  the laws of arms require  and each party drew off in silent expectation  of the event     On the second morning  as I revolved my late dangers  and indulged the  pleasing thoughts of my fate being soon to be decided by the fair and  honourable chance of arms  an officer from count Mal leon appeared  before the place of my residence and demanded admission to Lord  Salisbury  I received him accompanied by my friend   Count Savourè   said he  thirsts not for thy blood  It hath been thy desire to depart  this island in peace  he commands me to acquaint thee that a barque is  prepared  and that thou
