misfortune  that I suppressed my concern  and told him  that altho  I had not another copy  I should be able to retrieve the loss by writing another from my memory  which was very tenacious  You cannot imagine how well pleased Mr  Supple was at this assurance  he begged I would set about it immediately  and carefully revolve and recollect every circumstance  before I pretended to commit it to paper  that it might be the same individual play that he had perused —Encouraged by this injunction  which plainly demonstrated how much he interested himself in the affair  I tasked my remembrance and industry  and in three weeks produced the exact image of the former  which was conveyed to him by my good friend  father O Varnish  who let me know next day  that Mr  Supple would revise it superficially  in order to judge of its sameness with the other  and then give his final answer —For this examination I allotted a week  and in full confidence of seeing it acted in a little while  demanded an audience of the manager  when that term was expired —But alas  the season had slipt away insensibly  he convinced me  that if my play had been put into rehearsal at that time  it could not have been ready for performing  until the end of March  when the benefit nights come on  consequently it would have interfered with   281 the interest of the players  whom it was not my business to disoblige   I was fain to acquiesce in these reasons  which to be sure were extremely just  and to reserve my performance to the next season  when he hoped I would not be so unlucky —Although it was a grievous disappointment to me  who by this time  began to want both money and necessaries  having  on the strength of my expectation from the theatre  launched out into some extravagancies  by which the sum I brought to town was already almost consumed —Indeed  I ought to be ashamed at this circumstance of my conduct  For my finances were sufficient  with good oeconomy  to have maintained me comfortably a whole year —You will perhaps be amazed when I tell you  that in six months  I expended not a farthing less than ten guineas  But when one considers the temptations to which a young man is exposed in this great city  especially if he is addicted to pleasure as I am  the wonder will vanish  or at least abate —Nor was the cause of my concern limited to my own situation entirely  I had wrote an account of my good reception to my kinsman the farmer  and desired him to depend upon me for the money he had kindly accommodated me with  about the end of February  which promise I now found myself unable to perform —However  there was no remedy but patience  I applied to my landlord  who was a very good natured man  candidly owned my distress  and begged his advice in laying down some plan for my subsistence —He readily promised to consult his confessor on this subject  and in the mean time  told me  I was welcome to lodge and board with him  until fortune   282 should put it in my power to make restitution   Mr  O Varnish being informed of my necesty  offered to introduce me to the author of a weekly paper  who  he did not doubt  would employ me in that way  provided he should find me duly qualified  but upon enquiry  I understood  that this journal was calculated to foment divisions in the commonwealth  and therefore I desired to be excused from engaging in it —He then proposed that I should write something in the poetical way  which I might dispose of to a bookseller for a pretty sum of ready money  and perhaps establish my own character into the bargain  this event would infallibly procure friends  and my tragedy would appear next season to the best advantage  by being supported both by interest and reputation —I was charmed with this prospect  and having heard what friends Mr  Pope required by his pastorals  set about a work of that kind  and in less than six weeks  composed as many ecclogues  which I forthwith offered to an eminent bookseller  who desired I would leave them for his perusal  and he would give me an answer in two days —At the end of that time  I went to him  when he returned the poems  telling me  they would not answer his purpose  and sweetned his refusal  by saying there were some good clever lines in them —Not a little dejected at his rebuff  which  I learned from Mr  O Varnish  was owing to the opinion of another author  whom this bookseller always consulted on these occasions  I applied to another person of the same profession  who told me  that the town was cloyed with pastorals  and advised me  if I intended to profit by my talents  to write something   283 satirical or luscious  such as the Button Hole  Shocky and Towzer  the Leaky Vessel   c —and yet this was a man in years  who wore a reverend periwig  looked like a senator  and went regularly to church —Be that as it will  I scorned to prostitute my pen in the manner he
