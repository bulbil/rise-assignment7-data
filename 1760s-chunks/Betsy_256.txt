              CHAPTER IV       Contains  among other particulars  certain bridal admonitions          Though Mr  Francis Thoughtless did not judge it convenient to reproach   his sister in the presence of Mr  Munden  on the complaints of that   gentleman  yet she had no sooner vented the little spleen she had been   that instant possessed of  than she began to excuse herself of having   been too poignant to a person whom she had promised to make her husband       To atone  therefore  for the severity of her late behaviour   This is a   good  handsome  clean hack   said she with a smile   one would think my   fellow had pitched on such a one on purpose  to keep me from regretting   my not having one of my own         I only wish  Madam   replied Mr  Munden   that you might be reconciled   to such things as are in my power to accommodate you with  till I am so   happy to present you with every thing you can desire     Let us talk no   more of that   cried she   be assured that  whatever I may have said  I   am far from thinking the happiness of life consists in grandeur        Mr  Munden  on these words  kissed her hand  and she permitted him to   hold it between his till they came out of the coach       This  indeed  had been the very last effort of all the maiden pride and   vanity of Miss Betsy  and Mr  Munden henceforward had no reason to   complain of her behaviour towards him       Sir Ralph Trusty  in regard to his age and character  had the honour of   nominating the day for the celebration of their nuptials  and Miss Betsy   made no excuses  or order to protract the time  but agreed with as much   readiness as her future bridegroom could have wished       The good Lady Trusty  as well as the two Mr  Thoughtlesses  however    being not yet able to assure themselves that nothing was to be feared   from the uncertainty of her temper  did every thing in their power to   keep her in good humour with her fate  and to their endeavours it may    perhaps  be ascribed  much more than to the force of her own resolution   that she ceased to be guilty of any thing that might give the least   cause of discontent to Mr  Munden  or betray that which  in spite of all   she could do  preyed upon herself       To these assiduities of her friends  another motive might also be added   for the keeping up her spirits  which was  that of her mind being   continually employed  Mr  Munden had taken a very handsome house  the   upholsterer received all the orders for the furnishing it from   her  there were  besides  many other things necessary for the rendering   it compleat  that were not in his province to supply  the going    therefore  to shops and warehouses for that purpose  took a very great   part of her time  What could be spared from these  and some other   preparations for her wedding  either Lady Trusty  or her brothers  had   the address to engage  one or other of them were always with her  till   the night was far advanced  and sleep became more welcome than any   meditations she could indulge       The appointed day at length arrived  she was conducted to the altar by   Sir Ralph Trusty  where  being met by Mr  Munden  the ceremony of   marriage was performed  none being present at it but Lady Trusty and her   two brothers  for as she could not have celebrated it with that pomp and   eclat agreeable to a woman of her humour  she had earnestly desired it   might be done with all the privacy imaginable       The indissoluble knot now tied  they proceeded to Pontac s  where an   elegant entertainment being prepared for them by Mr  Munden s orders    they dined  and afterwards went all together to a lodging Mr  Munden had   hired  for a small time  in a little village five or six miles from   London       This he had done to oblige his bride  who had told him she desired to be   lost to the world till the first discourse of their marriage should be   over  to avoid the visits and congratulations of their friends on that   occasion       It would be needless to tell the reader that there was a general scene   of
