by all his neighbours as much for his personal merit as for his family fortune  With respect to his son Launcelot  whom you have seen  I can remember nothing until he returned from the university  about the age of seventeen  and then I myself was not more than ten years old  The young gemman was at that time in mourning for his mother  though  God knows  Sir Everhard had more cause to rejoice than to be afflicted at her death —for  among friends   here he lowered his voice  and looked round the kitchen    she was very whimsical  expensive  ill tempered  and  I m afraid  a little—upon the— flightly order—a little touched or so —but mum for that—the lady is now dead  and it is my maxim  de mortuis nil nisi bonum  The young squire was even then very handsome  and looked remarkably well in his weepers  but he had an awkward air and shambling gait  stooped mortally  and was so shy and silent that he would not look a stranger in the face  nor open his mouth before company  Whenever he spied a horse or carriage at the gate  he would make his escape into the garden  and from thence into the park  where many is the good time and often he has been found sitting under a tree  with a book in his hand  reading Greek  Latin  and other foreign linguas    Sir Everhard himself was no great scholar  and my father had forgot his classical learning  and so the rector of the parish was desired to examine young Launcelot  It was a long time before he found an opportunity  the squire always gave him the slip —At length the parson catched him in bed of a morning  and  locking the door  to it they went tooth and nail  What passed betwixt them the Lord in heaven knows  but when the doctor came forth  he looked wild and haggard as if he had seen a ghost  his face as white as paper  and his lips trembling like an aspen leaf   Parson   said the knight   what is the matter —how dost find my son  I hope he won t turn out a ninny  and disgrace his family   The doctor  wiping the sweat from his forehead  replied  with some hesitation   he could not tell—he hoped the best—the squire was to be sure a very extraordinary young gentleman  —But the father urging him to give an explicit answer  he frankly declared  that  in his opinion  the son would turn out either a mirror of wisdom  or a monument of folly  for his genius and disposition were altogether preternatural  The knight was sorely vexed at this declaration  and signified his displeasure by saying  the doctor  like a true priest  dealt in mysteries and oracles  that would admit of different and indeed contrary interpretations  He afterwards consulted my father  who had served as a steward upon the estate for above thirty years  and acquired a considerable share of his favour   Will Clarke   said he  with tears in his eyes   what shall I do with this unfortunate lad  I would to God he had never been born  for I fear he will bring my grey hairs with sorrow to the grave  When I am gone  he will throw away the estate  and bring himself to infamy and ruin  by keeping company with rooks and beggars —O Will  I could forgive extravagance in a young man  but it breaks my heart to see my only son give such repeated proofs of a mean spirit and sordid disposition     Here the old gentleman shed a flood of tears  and not without some shadow of reason  By this time Launcelot was grown so reserved to his father  that he seldom saw him or any of his relations  except when he was in a manner forced to appear at table  and there his bashfulness seemed every day to increase  On the other hand  he had formed some very strange connexions  Every morning he visited the stable  where he not only conversed with the grooms and helpers  but scraped acquaintance with the horses  he fed his favourites with his own hand  stroked  caressed  and rode them by turns  till at last they grew so familiar  that  even when they were a field at grass  and saw him at a distance  they would toss their manes  whinny like so many colts at sight of the dam  and  galloping up to the place where he stood  smell him all over    You must know that I myself  though a child  was his companion in all these excursions  He took a liking to me on account of my being his godson  and gave me more money than I knew what to do with  He had always plenty of cash for the asking  as my father was ordered to supply him liberally  the knight thinking that a command of money might help to raise his thoughts to a proper consideration of his own importance  He never could endure a common beggar  that was not either in a state of infancy or of old age  but  in other respects  he made the guineas fly in such a manner
