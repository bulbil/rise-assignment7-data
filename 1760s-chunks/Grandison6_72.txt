Sir Charles Grandison  before I saw him  I was vexed to find him  at first sight  answer what I had heard of him  for I was resolved to dislike him  tho  he had been an angel  But  ah  my poor brother —I am afraid  I myself shall be ready to give up his interest —No wonder  my dear Miss Byron  that nobody else would do  when you had seen this man —But still  let me bespeak your pity for my brother —Would to Heaven you had not gone to London —What went you thither for   Sir Charles kindly enquired of her after Mr  Orme s health  praised him for his character  wished his recovery  and to be allowed to cultivate the friendship of so worthy a man  And all this with an air so sincere —But good men must love one another   SIR Charles has just now declared to my aunt  that he thinks of going up to town  or to Grandison hall  I forget if they told me which  to morrow or next day  Perhaps he knows not to which himself  I was surprised  Perhaps he is tired with us  Let me recollect—Thursday was Se nnight  Why indeed he has been down with us twelve days —No less   But he has no doubts  no suspences frum us  to keep Love awake  His path is plain and smooth before him  He has demanded his day  We think we cannot immediately  and after so short a time past since his declaring himself  give it him—And why should he lose his precious time among us  I suppose he will be so good as to hold himself in readiness to obey our summons—He expects a summons from us  perhaps —  O my dear Lady G  am I not perverse  I believe I am  Yet where there is room  from past circumstances  to dread a slight  tho  none may be intended  and truly as I honour and revere Lady Clementina  my mind is not always great enough  perhaps from consciousness   179 of demerit  to carry itself above apprehension and petulance  noble as is the man   My uncle is a little down upon it  and why  Because  truly  my grandmamma has told him  that it is really too early yet to fix the day  and he reverences  as every body does  her judgment   But why  he asks  cannot there be preparation making  Why may not something be seen going forward   What  before the day is named  my aunt asks—As Harriet had desired to have his next Letters arrive before she directly answered his question  she could not recede   He went from them both greatly dissatisfied  and exclaiming against womens love of power  and never knowing how to make a right use of it   A message from Sir Charles  He desires to attend me  I believe I shall be a little sullen  I know my heart  It is all his own  and I am loth to disoblige him—But he was far  far more attendant on Lady Clementina s motions  Don t you think so  Lady G  But she was all excellence—Well—But hush —I say no more —  I WILL give you an account of our conversation  I verily believe  that  had he not touched the poor snail with too hasty a singer  which made her shrink in again into her shell  I might have been brought to name the week  tho  not the day   But I will not anticipate   He entered with a very polite and affectionate air  He enquired after my health  and said  I looked not well—Only vexed  thought I   It is impossible  I believe  to hold displeasure in the presence of a beloved object  with whom we are not mortally offended  My dearest Miss Byron  said he  taking my passive hand  I am come to ask your advice on twenty subjects  In the first place  here is a Letter   180 from Lady G  recommending to me a house near her own  He gave it to me  I read it   Should you  madam  approve of Grosvenor Square   I was silent  You will guess how my captious folly appeared to him  by what he said to me  He respectfully took my hand—Why so solemn  dear madam  Why so silent  Has any thing disturbed you  Some little displeasure seems to hang upon that open countenance  Not at me  I hope   Yes it is  thought I  But I did not intend you should see it —I cleared up  and without answering his question  said  It is in the neighbourhood of Lady L  I hope   Thank you  madam  for that hope—It is  Nor far from your cousin Reeves s   I can have no objection  Sir   I will refer myself  on this sublect  if you please  to my sisters  and Lord G  He values himself on his taste in houses and furniture  and will be delighted to be put into commission with my sisters on this occasion  Or shall I stay till the happy day is over  and leave the choice wholly to yourself
