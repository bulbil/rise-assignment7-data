glow  and she exclaimed   Dear brother  I am  overjoyed to see you  Pray come into our coach   He took the hint  immediately  and  complying with her request  embraced this new sister  with great affection   Perceiving that her attendant was very much surprised and alarmed at  this unexpected meeting  she  in order to banish her suspicion  and at  the same time give her lover his cue  told him that his brother  meaning  her husband  was gone to the Spa for a few weeks  by the advice of  physicians  on account of his ill state of health  and that  from his  last letter  she had the pleasure to tell him he was in a fair way of  doing well  The young gentleman expressed his satisfaction at this  piece of news  observing  with an air of fraternal concern  that if  his brother had not made too free with his constitution  his friends in  England would have had no occasion to repine at his absence and want of  health  by which he was banished from his own country and connections   He then asked  with an affectation of surprise  why she had not  accompanied her spouse  and was given to understand that his tenderness  of affection would not suffer him to expose her to the fatigues of the  journey  which lay among rocks that were almost inaccessible   The duenna s doubts being eased by this preamble of conversation  he  changed the subject to the pleasures of the place  and  among other  such questions  inquired if she had as yet visited Versailles  This is  a public house  situated upon the canal  at the distance of about  two miles from town  and accommodated with tolerable gardens  for the  entertainment of company  When she replied in the negative  he proposed  to accompany her thither immediately  but the governante  who had  hitherto sat silent  objected to this proposal  telling them  in broken  English  that as the lady was under her care  she could not answer to  Mr  Hornbeck for allowing her to visit such a suspicious place   As  for that matter  madam   said the confident gallant   give yourself no  trouble  the consequences shall be at my peril  and I will undertake to  insure you against my brother s resentment   So saying  he directed the  coachman to the place  and ordered his own to follow  under the auspices  of his valet de chambre  while the old gentlewoman  overruled by his  assurance  quietly submitted to his authority   Being arrived at the place  he handed the ladies from the coach   and then  for the first time  observed that the duenna was lame  a  circumstance of which he did not scruple to take the advantage  for  they had scarce alighted  and drunk a glass of wine  when he advised his  sister to enjoy a walk in the garden  and although the attendant made  shift to keep them almost always in view  they enjoyed a detached  conversation  in which Peregrine learned that the true cause of her  being left behind at Brussels  whilst her husband proceeded to Spa  was  his dread of the company and familiarities of that place  to which his  jealousy durst not expose her  and that she had lived three weeks in a  convent at Lisle  from which she was delivered by his own free motion   because indeed he could no longer exist without her company  and   lastly  our lover understood that her governante was a mere dragon   who had been recommended to him by a Spanish merchant  whose wife she  attended to her dying day  but she very much questioned whether or not    6 22 15  3 45 PM   her fidelity was proof enough against money and strong waters  Peregrine  assured her the experiment should be tried before parting  and they  agreed to pass the night at Versailles  provided his endeavours should  succeed   Having exercised themselves in this manner  until his duenna s spirits  were pretty much exhausted  that she might be the be the better  disposed to recruit them with a glass of liqueur  they returned to their  apartment  and the cordial was recommended and received in a bumper  but  as it did not produce such a visible alteration as the sanguine hopes  of Pickle had made him expect  and the old gentlewoman observed that it  began to be late  and that the gates would be shut in a little time  he  filled up a parting glass  and pledged her in equal quantity  Her blood  was too much chilled to be warmed even by this extraordinary dose  which  made immediate innovation in the brain of our youth  who  in the gaiety  of his imagination  overwhelmed this she Argus with such profusion of  gallantry  that she was more intoxicated with his expressions than with  the spirits she had drunk  When in the course of toying he dropped a  purse into her bosom  she seemed to forget how the night wore  and
