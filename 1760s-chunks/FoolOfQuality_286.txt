judged it time to forward his Harry s education    especially with respect to his knowledge of the world  of the views    pleasures  manners  bent  employments  and characters of mankind      For this purpose  he proposed to leave Arabella sole regent of   his family  and  for a few weeks  to stay with Clement and Harry   in London  there to show him whatever might gratify his curiosity    or merit his inspection          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  309      While the coach was in waiting  and they all stood on the hill    the great city being extended in ample view beneath them  Mr    Fenton exclaimed Oh  London   London   thou mausoleum of dead   souls  how pleasant art thou to the eye  how beautiful in outward   prospect   but within  how full of rottenness and reeking abomina    tions   Thy dealers are all students in the mystery of iniquity  of   fraud and imposition on ignorance and credulity  Thy public   offices are hourly exercised in exactions and extortion  Thy courts   of judicature are busied in the sale  the delay  or perversion of   justice   they are shut to the injured and indigent  but open to   the wealthy pleas of the invader and oppressor  Thy magistracy   is often employed in secretly countenancing and abetting the breach   of those laws it was instituted to maintain  Thy charities sub    scribed for the support of the poor  are lavished by the trustees in   pampering the rich  where drunkenness swallows till it wallows    gluttony stuffs till it pants  and unbottons and stuffs again  Even   the great ones of thy court have audaciously smiled away the   gloom and horrors of guilt  and refined  as it were  all the gross    ness thereof  by inverting terms and palliating phrases  While the   millions that crowd and hurry through thy streets are universally   occupied in striving and struggling to rise by the fall  to fatten by   the leanness  and to thrive by the ruin of their fellows  Thy   offences are rank   they steam and cloud the face of heaven  The   gulf also is hollow beneath that is one day to receive thee  But the   measure of thy abominations is not yet full   and the number of   thy righteous hath hitherto exceeded the proportion that was found   in the first Sodom      That evening they went to the opera  where Harry was so cap    tivated by the sentimental meltings and varied harmony of the   airs  that he requested Mr  Fenton to permit him to be instructed   on some instrument  Not by my advice  my dear  answered Mr    Fenton   I would not wish you to attempt any thing in which you   may not excel  Music is a science that requires the application of   a man s whole life in order to arrive at any eminence  As it is en    chanting in the hand of a master  it is also discordant and grating   in its inferior degrees  Your labours have been employed to much   more valuable purposes   and I would not  as they say  give my   child s time for a song  Harry instantly acquiesced with the best   temper imaginable  as the will of his beloved patron was  truly   speaking  his own will   and that he only wanted to know it  to    be at all times  and on all occasions  comformable thereto      A few following days were employed in visiting the Tower    in surveying the armoury  regalia   c   in viewing the Monument   and Exchange   and lastly  in contemplating the solemnity of West    minster Abbey  with the marbled effigies and monumental deposits   of the renowned in death the place  as Mr  Fenton affectingly   observed  to which all the living must finally adjourn      The next night they went to the theatre  to see the feats of   Signer Vplanti  the celebrated Italian posture master  rope dancer    and equilibrist  Such wonders are now so common as to be scarce   entertaining  but  at that time  they were received with bursts   and roars of applause          310 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      Our hero felt himself attached by the similar excellencies of his   own activity in another   and  going behind 1he scenes  he accosted   Volanti in French  Signor  said he  I have been highly entertained   by your performance this night  and here are five guineas hi return   of the pleasure you have given me  The foreigner looked at Harry    and then at the money  with a
