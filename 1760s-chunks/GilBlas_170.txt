brought this young captive hither  it is true that I have introduced him into my apartment  with just such artifices as I should have used if I had entertained a violent passion for him  And yet  I call our great prophet to witness  in spite of these seeming irregularities  I am not faithless to you  It was my wish to converse with this Christian slave  for the purpose of disengaging him from his own sect  and proselytising him to that of the true believers  But I have found in him a principle of resistance for which I was not well prepared  I have  however  conquered his prejudices  and he came to give me an assurance that he would embrace Mahometanism   I do not mean to deny that it was an act of duty to have contradicted the favourite flatly  without paying the least attention to the dangerous predicament in which I stood  but my spirits were taken by surprise  the beloved partner of my imprudence was hovering on the brink of perdition  and my own fate was involved with hers  How could I do otherwise than give a silent and perturbed assent to her impious fiction  My tongue  indeed  refused to ratify it  but the bashaw  persuaded by my acquiescence that his mistress had told him the whole truth and nothing but the truth  suffered his angry spirit to be tranquillized  Madam  answered he  I am willing to believe that you have committed no infidelity towards me  and that the desire of doing a thing agreeable to the prophet has been the means of leading you on to risk so hazardous and delicate a proceeding  I forgive  therefore  your imprudence  on condition that this captive assumes the turban on the spot  He sent immediately for a priest to initiate me   These wandering priests are at present known in Africa by the name of Marabut  The first gymnosophists of Ethiopia most probably were nothing more     TRANSLATOR   My dress was changed with all due ceremony into the Turkish  They did just what they pleased with me  nor had I the courage to object  or  to do myself more justice  I knew not what was becoming of me  in so dreadful a disorder of all my faculties and feelings  There are other good Christians in the world  who have been guilty of apostatizing on less imminent emergencies   After the ceremony  I took my leave of the seraglio  to go and possess myself  under the name of Sidy Hali  of an inferior office which Soliman had given me  I never saw the sultana more  but an eunuch of hers came one day to look after me  He brought with him  as a present from his mistress  jewels to a very considerable amount  accompanied with a letter  in which the lady assured me she should never forget my generous compliance  in turning Mahometan to save her life  In point of fact  besides these rich gifts  lavished upon me by Farrukhnaz  I obtained through her interest a more considerable employment than my first  and in the course of six or seven years became one of the richest renegadoes in the town of Algiers   You must be perfectly aware  that if I assisted at the prayers put up by the Mussulmen in their mosques  or fulfilled the other observances of their religion  it was all a mere copy of my countenance  My inclination was always uniform and determined  as to returning before my death into the bosom of our holy church  and with this view I looked forward to withdrawing some time or other into Spain or Italy with the riches I should have accumulated  But there seemed no reason whatever against enjoying life in the interval  I was established in a magnificent mansion  with gardens of extent and beauty  a numerous train of slaves  and a well appointed equipage of pretty girls in my seraglio  Though the Mahometans are forbidden the use of wine in that country  they are not backward for the most part in their stolen libations  As for me  my orgies were without either a mask or a blush  after the manner of my brother renegadoes  I remember in particular two of my bottle companions  with whom I often drank down the night before we rose from table  One was a Jew  and the other an Arabian  I took them to be good sort of people  and  with that impression  lived in unconstrained familiarity with them  One evening I invited them to sup at my house  On that very day a dog of mine died    it was a pet  we performed our pious ablutions on his lifeless clay  and buried him with all the solemn obsequies attendant on a Mahometan funeral  This act of ours was not designed to turn the religion we outwardly professed into ridicule  it was only to furnish ourselves with amusement  and give loose to a ludicrous whim which struck us in the moment of jollity  that of paying the last offices of humanity to my dog   This action was  however  very near laying me by the heels  On the following day there came a fellow to my house  saying  Master Sidy Hali  it is no laughing matter that induces me to pay you this visit  My employer  the cadi
