whose advice she could   depend in any exigence whatever  for  as to her elder brother  he was   too eager in the pursuit of his pleasures  and too much absorbed in   them  to be truly solicitous for any thing that did not immediately   relate to them  she saw him but seldom  and  when she did so  there was   a certain distance in his behaviour towards her which would not permit   her to talk to him with that freedom she could have wished to do       She had not  however  any fresh motive to regret their departure on this   account  Mr  Munden continued to behave to her in much the same manner   as he had done since the breach had been made up between them  he was    indeed  very much abroad  but as she was far from being passionately   fond of him  and only desired he would treat her with civility when with   her  the little she enjoyed of his company was no manner of affliction   to her       She still retained some part of that gaiety  and love of a variety of   conversation  which had always been a predominant propensity in her   nature  and though in all her excursions  and the liberties she took    she carefully avoided every thing that might taint her virtue  or even   cast a blemish on her reputation  yet were they such  as a husband who   had loved with more ardency  would not  perhaps  have been very easy   under  on his part  also  the late hours he came home at  the messages   and letters which were daily brought to him by porters  might have given   much disquiet to a wife  not defended from jealousy by so great a share   of indifference  but in this they were perfectly agreed  neither offered   to interfere with the amusements of the other  nor even pretended to   enquire into the nature of them       Though this was a mode of living together  which was far from being   capable of producing that happiness for which the state of marriage was   ordained  yet was it perfectly easy to persons who had so little real   affection for each other  and  however blameable in the eyes of the   truly discreet  escaped the censure of the generality of mankind  by   it s being so frequently practised       But I shall not expatiate on their present manner of behaviour to each   other  since it was not of any long continuance  but proceed to the   recital of a little adventure  which  though it may seem trifling to the   reader in the repetition  will hereafter be found of some consequence       It was a mighty custom with Lady Mellasin and Miss Flora  when they had   nothing of more consequence to entertain them  to go among the shops    and amuse themselves with enquiring after new fashions  and looking over   that variety of merchandize which is daily brought to this great mart of   vanity and luxury       Mrs  Munden  while in a virgin state  and a boarder at Mr  Goodman s    used frequently to accompany those ladies when bent on such sort of   rambles  and she still was fond enough of satisfying her curiosity this   way  at such times as she found nothing else to do  or was not in a   humour to give or receive visits       Happening one day to pass by the well furnished shop of an eminent   mercer  and seeing several silks lie spread upon the counter  she was   tempted to step in  and examine them more nearly  A great number of   others were also taken from the shelves  and laid before her  but she   not seeming to approve any of them  the mercer told her he had some   curious pieces out of the loom that morning of a quite new pattern    which he had sent his man with to a lady of quality  and expected he   would be back in a few minutes  so intreated she would be pleased either   to stay a little  or give him directions where she might be waited upon       Mrs  Munden complied with the former of these requests  and the rather    because  while they were talking  she heard from a parlour  behind the   shop  a harpsichord very finely touched  accompanied with a female voice   which sung  in the most harmonious accents  part of this air  composed   by the celebrated Signior Bononcini             M insegna l amor l inganno        Mi togl al cor  l assanno          Mi da l ardir amor
