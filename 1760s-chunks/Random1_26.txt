where we go to bed—in the night we are awaked by a dreadful adventure—next night we lodge at the house of a school master—our treatment there   STRAP and I were about to depart on our journey  when we perceived a croud on the road  coming towards us  shouting and hollowing all the way  As it approached  we could discern a man on horse back in the middle  with his hands tied behind him  whom we soon knew to be Rifle —This highwayman not being so well mounted as the two servants who went in pursuit of him  was soon overtaken  and after having discharged his pistols  made prisoner without any further opposition  They were carrying him in triumph  amidst the acclamations of the country people  to a justice of peace in a neighbouring village  but stopt at our inn to join their companion and take refreshment  When Rifle was dismounted  and placed in the yard  within a circle of peasants armed with pitch forks  I was amazed to see what a pitiful dejected fellow he now appeared  who had but a few hours ago    66 filled me with so much terror and confusion —My companion was so much encouraged by this alteration in his appearance  that going up to the thief  he presented his clenched fists to his nose  and declared  that he would either cudgel or box with the prisoner for a guinea  which he immediately produced  and began to strip—but was dissuaded from this adventure by me  who represented to him the folly of the undertaking  as Rifle was now in the hands of justice  which would  no doubt  give us all satisfaction enough —But what made me repent of our impertinent curiosity  was our being detained by the captors  as evidence against him  when we were just going to set forward  However  there was no remedy  we were obliged to comply  and accordingly joined in the cavalcade  which luckily took the same road that we proposed —About the twilight we arrived at the place of our destination  but as the justice was gone to visit a gentleman in the country  with whom he would probably stay all night  the robber was confined in an empty garret three stories high  from which it seemed impossible for him to escape  this  nevertheless  was the case  for next morning  when they went up stairs  to bring him before the justice  the bird was flown  having got out at the window upon the leads  from whence he continued his rout along the tops of the adjoining houses  and got into another garret window  where he sculked  until the family were asleep  at which time he ventured down stairs  and let himself out by the street door  which was found open  This event was a great disappointment to those that apprehended him  who were flushed with hopes of the reward  but gave me great joy  as I was permitted now to continue my journey without any further molestation —Resolving to make up for the small   67 progress we had hitherto made  we this day travelled with great vigour  and before night got to a market town twenty miles from the place from whence we set out in the morning  without meeting any adventure worth notice —Here having taken up our lodging at an inn  I found myself so fatigued  that I began to despair of performing our journey on foot  and desired Strap to enquire if there was any waggon  return horses  or other cheap carriage in this place  to depart for London to morrow or next day —He was informed  that the waggon from Newcastle for London had halted here two nights ago  and that it would be an easy matter to overtake it  if not the next day  at farthest the day after the next —This piece of news gave us some satisfaction  and after making a hearty supper on hashed mutton  we were shewn to our room  which contained two beds  the one allotted for us  and the other for a very honest gentleman  who  we were told  was then drinking below  Though we could have very well dispensed with his company  we were glad to submit to this disposition  as there was not another bed empty in the house  and accordingly went to rest  after having secured our baggage under the bolster  About two or three a clock in the morning  I was waked out of a very profound sleep  by a dreadful noise in the chamber  which did not fail to throw me into an agony of consternation  when I heard these words pronounced with a terrible voice —   Blood and wounds  run the halbert into the guts of him that s next you  and I ll blow the other s brains out presently  —  This dreadful salutation had no sooner reached the ears of Strap  than starting out of bed  he run against some body in the dark    68 and overturned him in an instant  at the same time bawling out    Fire  murder  fire   which in a moment alarmed the whole house  and filled our chamber with a croud of naked people —When lights were brought  the occasion of all this disturbance soon appeared  which was no other than our fellow lodger  whom we found lying on
