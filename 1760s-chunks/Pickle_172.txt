he was more intent upon disguising them  His declaration to  Pickle in the morning would not suffer him to start any objections when  he received the challenge  and finding that the young gentleman made  no offer of mediating the affair  but rather congratulated him on the  occasion  when he communicated the painter s billet  all his efforts  consisted in oblique hints  and general reflections upon the absurdity    6 22 15  3 45 PM   of duelling  which was first introduced among civilised nations by the  barbarous Huns and Longobards  He likewise pretended to ridicule the use  of firearms  which confounded all the distinctions of skill and address   and deprived a combatant of the opportunity of signalizing his personal  prowess   Pickle assented to the justness of his observations  but  at the same  time  represented the necessity of complying with the customs of this  world  ridiculous as they were  on which a man s honour and reputation  depend  so that  seeing no hopes of profiting by that artifice  the  republican s agitation became more and more remarkable  and he proposed   in plain terms  that they should contend in armour  like the combatants  of ancient days  for it was but reasonable that they should practise  the manner of fighting  since they adopted the disposition of those iron  times   Nothing could have afforded more diversion to our hero than the sight of  two such duellists cased in iron  and he wished that he had promoted the  quarrel in Brussels  where he could have hired the armour of Charles the  Fifth  and the valiant Duke of Parma  for their accommodation  but as  there was no possibility of furnishing them cap a pie at Antwerp  he  persuaded him to conform to the modern use of the sword  and meet the  painter on his own terms  and suspecting that his fear would supply him  with other excuses for declining the combat  he comforted him with some  distant insinuations  to the prejudice of his adversary s courage  which  would  in all probability  evaporate before any mischief could happen   Notwithstanding this encouragement  he could not suppress the reluctance  with which he went to the field  and cast many a wishful look over his  left shoulder  to see whether or not his adversary was at his heels   When  by the advice of his second  he took possession of the ground  and  turned about with his face to the enemy  it was not so dark  but that  Peregrine could perceive the unusual paleness of his countenance  and  the sweat standing in large drops upon his forehead  nay  there was a  manifest disorder in his speech  when he regretted his want of the pila  and parma  with which he would have made a rattling noise  to astonish  his foe  in springing forward  and singing the hymn to battle  in the  manner of the ancients   In the meantime  observing the hesitation of his antagonist  who  far  from advancing  seemed to recoil  and even struggle with his second  he  guessed the situation of the painter s thoughts  and  collecting all the  manhood that he possessed  seized the opportunity of profiting by  his enemy s consternation  Striking his sword and pistol together  he  advanced in a sort of trot  raising a loud howl  in which he repeated   in lieu of the Spartan song  part of the strophe from one of Pindar s  Pythia  beginning with ek theon gar makanoi pasai Broteais aretais   etc  This imitation of the Greeks had all the desired effect upon the  painter  who seeing the physician running towards him like a fury  with  a pistol in his right hand  which was extended  and hearing the dreadful  yell he uttered  and the outlandish words he pronounced  was seized  with a universal palsy of his limbs  He would have dropped down upon  the ground  had not Pipes supported and encouraged him to stand upon his  defence  The doctor  contrary to his expectation  finding that he had  not flinched from the spot  though he had now performed one half of his  career  put in practice his last effort  by firing his pistol  the noise  of which no sooner reached the ears of the affrighted painter  than    6 22 15  3 45 PM   he recommended his soul to God  and roared for mercy with great  vociferation   The republican  overjoyed at this exclamation  commanded him to yield   and surrender his arms  on pain of immediate death  upon which he threw  away his pistols and sword  in spite of all the admonitions and even  threats of his second  who left him to his fate  and went up to his  master  stopping his nose with signs of loathing and abhorrence   The victor  having won the spolia opima  granted him his life  on  condition that he would on his knees supplicate his pardon  acknowledge  himself inferior to his conqueror in every virtue and qualification  and  promise for the future to merit
