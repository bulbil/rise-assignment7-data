      In the mean time the father of monsieur de Coigney being informed of   these proceedings  thought it beneath his son to carry on a clandestine   courtship  and the great share he possessed of the royal favour  he   having been instrumental in gaining some point in the parliament of   Paris  rendered him vain enough to imagine his alliance would not be   refused  tho  there was a superiority both of birth and fortune on the   side of monsieur the baron de Palfoy       In a perfect confidence of succeeding in his request  he went to his   house  and  after some little preparation  proposed a match between his   son and mademoiselle de Palfoy  The baron was not at all surprized at   what he said  because he expected  if the young people were kept   asunder  an offer would be made of this kind  and after hearing calmly   all he had to say  in order to induce him to give his consent  he told   him  that he was very sorry he had asked a thing which it was impossible   to grant  because he had already determined to dispose otherwise of his   daughter  Monsieur de Coigney then asked to whom  I know not as yet    replied the other  but when I said I had determined to dispose her   otherways  I only meant to one who is of blood at least equal to her   own  and who has never  by any public debaucheries  rendered himself   contemptible to the discreet part of mankind       De Coigney knew not how either to put up or resent this affront  he knew   very well that his son had behaved so as to give cause for it  yet   thought he had other perfections which might over balance what  by a   partial indulgence  he looked upon only as the follies of youth  and as   for the reflection on his family  he told the other  that whatever he   was he owed to the merit of his ancestors  not his own  and that he   doubted not but his son would one day raise his name equal to that of   Palfoy  In fine  the pride of the one  and the vanity of the other    occasioned a contest between them  which might have furnished matter for   a scene in a comedy had any poet been witness of it  the result of it   was that they agreed in this to be mutually dissatisfied with each   other  never to converse together any more  and to forbid all   communication between their families       The baron went immediately to his daughter s chamber  and having ordered   her maid  who was then doing something about her  to leave the room  I   have wondered  Charlotta  said he  with a countenance that was far from   betraying the secret vexation of his mind  that you have never  since   your coming to Paris  expressed the least desire of making a visit at   St  Germains  tho  the duty you owe a princess  who seems to have a very   great affection for you  might well have excused any impatience you   might have testified on that score  besides  you owe a visit to   mademoiselle de Coigney       The princess merits doubtless all the respect I am able to pay her    answered she  but  my lord  as it was your pleasure to remove me from   that palace  I waited till your command should licence my return  as for   mademoiselle de Coigney  the intimacy between us will excuse those   ceremonies which are of little weight where there is a real friendship       These words confirming all the baron s suspicions  he thought there was   no need of farther dissimulation  and the long conceived indignation   burst out in looks more furious than the trembling Charlotta had ever   seen in him before   Yes  degenerate girl  said he  I have but too plain   proofs of the friendship in which you have linked yourself with the   family of the de Coigney s   but tell me  continued he  how dare you   engage yourself so far without my knowledge  could you ever hope I would   consent to an alliance with de Coigney       De Coigney  cried she  much more assured than she had been before the   mention of that name  heaven forbid you should have such a thought       The resolution and disdain with which she spoke these words a little   surprized him  what  cried he  have you not encouraged the addresses of   young de Coigney  and even proceeded so far as to make his father   imagine there required no more than to ask my consent to a marriage   between you       How much courage does
