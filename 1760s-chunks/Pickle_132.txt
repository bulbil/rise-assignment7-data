he sent in his servant with a message  importing   that he intended to set out from Paris the next day  in company with  Mr  Pickle  and desiring to know whether or not he was  or would be   prepared for the journey  The doctor  struck with the manner as well  as the matter of this intimation  went immediately to Pallet s room and  demanded to know the cause of such a sudden determination without his  privity or concurrence  and when he understood the necessity of their  affairs  rather than travel by himself  he ordered his baggage to be  packed up  and signified his readiness to conform to the emergency of  the case  though he was not at all pleased with the cavalier behaviour  of Pallet  to whom he threw out some hints on his own importance  and  the immensity of his condescension in favouring him with such marks of  regard  But by this time these insinuations had lost their effect upon  the painter who told him  with an arch sneer  that he did not at all  question his learning and abilities  and particularly his skill in    6 22 15  3 45 PM   cookery  which he should never forget while his palate retained its  function  but nevertheless advised him  for the sake of the degenerate  eaters of these days  to spare a little of his sal ammoniac in the next  sillykicaby he should prepare  and abate somewhat of the devil s dung   which he had so plentifully crammed into the roasted fowls  unless he  had a mind to convert his guests into patients  with a view of licking  himself whole for the expense of the entertainment   The physician  nettled at these sarcasms  eyed him with a look of  indignation and disdain  and  being  unwilling to express himself in  English  lest  in the course of the altercation  Pallet should be so  much irritated as to depart without him  he vented his anger in Greek   The painter  though by the sound he supposed this quotation to be Greek   complimented his friend upon his knowledge in the Welsh language  and  found means to rally him quite out of temper  so that he retired to  his own chamber in the utmost wrath and mortification  and left his  antagonist exulting over the victory he had won   While these things passed between these originals  Peregrine waited  upon the ambassador  whom he thanked for his kind interposition   acknowledging the indiscretion of his own conduct with such appearance  of conviction and promises of reformation  that his excellency freely  forgave him for all the trouble he had been put to on his account   fortified him with sensible advices and  assuring him of his continual  favour and friendship  gave him at parting  letters of introduction to  several persons of quality belonging to the British court   Thus distinguished  our young gentleman took leave of all his French  acquaintance  and spent the evening with some of those who had enjoyed  the greatest share of his intimacy and confidence  while Jolter  superintended his domestic concerns  and with infinite joy bespoke a  post chaise and horse  in order to convey him from a place where  he lived in continual apprehension of suffering by the dangerous  disposition of his pupil  Everything being adjusted according to their  plan  they and their fellow travellers next day dined together  and  about four in the afternoon took their departure in two chaises   escorted by the valet de chambre  Pipes  and the doctor s lacquey on  horseback  well furnished with arms and ammunition  in case of being  attacked by robbers on the road   It was about eleven o clock at night when they arrived at Senlis  which  was the place at which they proposed to lodge  and where they were  obliged to knock up the people of the inn  before they could have  their supper prepared  All the provision in the house was but barely  sufficient to furnish one indifferent meal  however  the painter  consoled himself for the quantity with the quality of the dishes  one of  which was a fricassee of rabbit  a preparation that he valued above  all the dainties that ever smoked upon the table of the sumptuous  Heliogabalus   He had no sooner expressed himself to this effect  than our hero   who almost incessantly laying traps for diversion at his neighbour s  expense  laid hold on the declaration  and  recollecting the story of  Scipio and the muleteer in Gil Blas  resolved to perpetrate a joke upon  the stomach of Pallet  which seemed well disposed to a hearty supper   He  accordingly  digested his plan  and the company being seated at  table  affected to stare with peculiar eagerness at the painter  who had    6 22 15  3 45 PM   helped himself to a large portion of the fricassee  and began to swallow  it with infinite relish  Pallet  notwithstanding the keenness of his  appetite  could not help taking notice of Pickle s demeanour  and   making a short pause in the exercise of his grinders
