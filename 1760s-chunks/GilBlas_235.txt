our heads that we might as well go in   The company was in general tolerably select at this house of call  There were two distinct apartments  and the pastime in each was of a very opposite nature  One was devoted to games of chance or skill  the other to literary and scientific discussion  and there were at that moment two clever men by profession handling an argument most pertinaciously  before ten or twelve auditors deeply interested in the discussion  There was no occasion to join the circle  because the metaphysical thunder of their logic made itself heard at a more respectful distance  the heat and passion with which this abstract controversy was managed made the two philosophers look little better than madmen  A certain Eleazar used to cast out devils  by tying a ring to the nose of the possessed  had these learned swine been ringed in the same manner  how many little imps would have taken wing out of their nostrils  Angels and ministers of grace defend us  said I to my companion  what contortions of gesture  what extravagance of elocution  One might as well argue with the town crier  How little do we know our natural calling in society  Very true indeed  answered he  you have read of Novius  the Roman pawnbroker  whose lungs went as far beyond the rattle of chariot  wheels  as his conscience beyond the rate of legal interest  the Novii must certainly have been transplanted into Spain  and these fellows are lineal descendants  But the hopeless part of the case is  that though our organs of sense are deafened  our understandings are not invigorated at their expense  We thought it best to make our escape from these braying metaphysicians  and by that prudent motion to avoid a headache which was just beginning to annoy us  We went and seated ourselves in a corner of the other room  whence  as we sipped our refreshing beverage  all comers and goers were obnoxious to our criticism  Nunez was acquainted with almost the whole set  Heaven and earth  exclaimed he  the clash of philosophy is as yet but in its beginning  fresh reinforcements are coming in on both sides  Those three men just on the threshold  mean to let slip the dogs of war  But do you see those two queer fellows going out  That little swarthy  leather complexioned Adonis  with long lank hair parted in the middle with mathematical exactness  is Don Juliano de Villanuno  He is a young barrister  with more of the prig than the lawyer about him  A party of us went to dine with him the other day  The occupation we caught him in was singular enough  He was amusing himself in his office with making a tall grey hound fetch and carry the briefs in the causes which were so unfortunate as to have him retained  and of course the canine amicus curiae set his fangs indifferently into the flesh of plaintiff or defendant  tearing law  equity  precedent  and principle into shreds  That licentiate at his elbow  with jolly  pimple spangled nose and cheeks  goes by the name of Don Cherubino Tonto  He is a canon of Toledo  and the greatest fool that was ever suffered to walk the earth without a keeper  And yet  he arrays his features in that sort of not quite unmeaning smile  that you would give him credit for good sense as well as good humour  His eye has the look of cunning if not of wisdom  and his laugh too much of sarcasm for an absolute idiot  One would conclude that he had a turn for mischief  but kept it down from principle and feeling  If you wish to take his opinion upon a work of genius  he will hear it read with so grave and wrapt a silence  as nothing but deep thought and acute mental criticism could justify  but the truth is  that he comprehends not one word  and therefore can have nothing to say  He was of the barrister party  There were a thousand good things said  as there always must be in a professional company  Don Cherubino added nothing to the mass of merriment  but looked such perfect approbation at those who did  was so tractable and complimentary a listener  that every man at table placed him second in the comparative estimate of merit   Do you know  said I to Nunez  who those two fellows are with dirty clothes and matted hair  their elbows on that table in the corner  and their cheeks upon their hands  whiffing foul breath into each other s nostrils as they lay their heads together  He told me that by their faces they were strangers to him  but that by physical and moral tokens they could only be coffee house politicians  venting their spleen against the measures of government  But do look at that spruce spark  whistling as he paces up and down the other room  and balancing himself alternately on one toe and on the other  That is Don Augustino Moreto  a young poet sufficiently of nature s mint and coinage to pass current  if flatterers and sciolists had not debased him into a mere coxcomb by their misplaced admiration  The man to whom he is going up with that familiar shake by the hand  is one of the set who write verses and then call themselves poets  who claim
