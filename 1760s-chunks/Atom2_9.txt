both armies were engaged  The contest  however  was not of long duration  tho  it proved fatal to the general on each side —Ya loff being slain  the command devolved upon Tohn syn  who pursued the enemy   49 to the walls of Quib quab  which was next day surrendered to him by capitulation  Nothing was now seen and heard in the capital but jubilee  triumph  and intoxication  and  indeed  the nation had not for some centuries  seen such an occasion for joy and satisfaction  The only person that did not heartily rejoice was the Dairo Got hama baba  By this time he was so Tartarised  that he grudged his subjects every advantage obtained in Fatsisio  and when Fika kaka hobbled up to him with the news of the victory  instead of saluting him with the kick of approbation  he turned his back upon him  saying   Boh  boh  What do you tell me of Quib quab  The damned Chinese are still on the frontiers of Yesso    As to the beast  it was doomed to undergo a variety of agitation  Its present gambols were interrupted by a fresh alarm from China    50 It was reported that two great armaments were equipped for a double descent upon the dominions of Japan  that one of these had already sailed north about for the island of Xicoco  to make a diversion in favour of the other  which  being the most considerable  was designed for the southern coast of Japan  These tidings  which were not without foundation  had such an effect upon the multitudinous monster  that it was first of all seized with an universal shivering  Its teeth chattered so loud  that the sound was heard at the distance of half a league  and for some time it was struck dumb  During this paroxysm it crawled silently on its belly to a sand hill just without the walls of Meaco  and began to scratch the earth with great eagerness and perseverance  Some people imagined it was digging for gold  but the truth is  the beast was making a hole   51 to hide itself from the enemy  whom it durst not look in the face  for  it must be observed of this beast  it was equally timorous and cruel  equally cowardly and insolent —So hard it laboured at this cavern  that it had actually burrowed itself all but the tail  when its good angel Taycho whistled it out  with the news of another compleat victory gained over the Chinese at sea  by the Sey seo gun Phal khan  who had sure enough discomfited or destroyed the great armament of the enemy  As for the other small squadron which had steered a northerly course to Xicoco  it was encountered  defeated  taken  and brought into the harbours of Japan  by three light Fune  under the command of a young chief called Hel y otte  who happened to be cruising on that part of the coast —The beast hearing Taycho s auspicious whistle  crept out with its   52 buttocks foremost  and having done him homage in the usual stile  began to react its former extravagances  It now considered this demagogue as the supreme giver of all good  and adored him accordingly  The apostle Bupo was no longer invoked  The temple of Fakkubasi was almost forgotten  and the Bonzas were universally despised  The praise of the prophet Taycho had swallowed up all other worship —Let us enquire how far he merited this adoration  how justly the unparalleled success of this year was ascribed to his conduct and sagacity  Kho rhé was taken by Kha fell  and Quib quab by Ya loff and Thon syn  By land  the Chinese were defeated in Fatsisio by Yan o ni  in the extremity of Asia  by Khutt whang  and in Tartary  by the Japonese bull dogs  without command or direction  At sea one of their squadrons had been   53 destroyed by Or nbos  a second by Fas khan  a third was taken by Hel y otte  a fourth was worsted and put to flight in three successive engagements near the land of Kamtschatka  by the chief Bha kakh  and their grand armament defeated by the Sey seo gun Phal khan  But Kha fell was a stranger to orator Taycho  Ya loff he had never seen  the bull dogs had been collected at random from the shambles of Meaco  he had never heard of Yan o ni s name  till he distinguished himself by his first victory  nor did he know there was any such person as Khutt whang existing  As for Or nbos  Fas khan  Phal khan  and Bha kakh  they had been Sey seo guns in constant employment under the former administration  and the youth Hel y otte owed his promotion to the interest of his own family —But it may be alledged  that Taycho projected in   54 his closet those plans that were crowned with success —We have seen how he mutilated and frittered the original scheme of the campaign in Fatsisio  so as to leave it at the caprice of Fortune  The reduction of Kho rhé was part of the design formed by the Banyan Thum khumm qua  which Taycho did all that lay in his power to render abortive  The plan of operations in the extremity of Tartary  he did not pretend to meddle with
