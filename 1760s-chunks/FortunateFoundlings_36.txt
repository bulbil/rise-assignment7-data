myself as under no obligation of secrecy  I will beg leave to   communicate it to you  ladies       With these words he took the letter out of his pocket and held it open   between them  Charlotta conquered her impatience so far as not to take   it out of his hand  but mademoiselle Coigney snatched it hastily    imagining she knew the hand  nor was she deceived in her conjecture  she   had no sooner read it slightly over   see here  mademoiselle Charlotta    said she  a new proof of madam de Olonne s folly  and my brother s   continued attachment to that vile woman       Charlotta then looked over the letter with a satisfaction that was   visible in her countenance  and as soon as she had done  then it is   plain  said she  that Horatio was mistaken for monsieur de Coigney  but   how it happened so is what I cannot conceive       I can easily solve the riddle  replied mademoiselle de Coigney  I heard   my brother say he intended to wear a hunting dress at the masquerade    but being disappointed of going to it  by his most christian majesty   sending for him to Marli  I suppose too suddenly for him to give notice   of his enforced absence to madame d  Olonne  and Horatio by chance   appearing in the same habit which he had doubtless told her he would be   in  and their sizes being pretty much alike  she might very well be   deceived  and also have a seeming reason for the jealousy and rage her   letter testifies       Nothing could exceed the joy Horatio felt at this unexpected   eclaircisement of his innocence  which was also doubled by the pleasure   which  in spight of all her endeavours to restrain it  he saw sparkle in   the eyes of his beloved Charlotta  Neither of them  however  had any   opportunity of expressing their sentiments at this time  de Coigney   continuing with them till dinner  when they all separated to go to their   respective tables       The next day afforded what in this he had sought in vain   he found her   alone in her own apartment  and having broke the ice  was now grown bold   enough to declare his passion  with all the embellishments necessary to   render it successful  mademoiselle Charlotta knew very well what became   the decorum of her sex  and was too nice an observer of it not to behave   with all the reserve imaginable on this occasion  All the freedom she   had been accustomed to treat him with  while ignorant of his or her own   inclination  was now banished from her words and actions  and she   gravely told him  that if he were in earnest  it was utterly improper   for her to receive any professions of that kind without the approbation   of monsieur de Palfoy her father  and as there was but very little   probability of his granting it  on many considerations  she would wish   him to quell in its infancy an affection which might otherwise be   attended with misfortunes to them both       It is certain  indeed  that in this she spoke no more than what her   reason suggested  she knew very well that her father had much higher   expectations in view for her  and that on the least suspicion of her   entertaining a foreigner  and one who seemed to have no other dependance   than that of favour  she should be immediately removed from St    Germains  so that it behoved her to be very circumspect in any   encouragement she gave him  but tho  she spoke to him in this manner  it   was not  as her actions afterwards fully demonstrated  that she really   designed what she said should make him desist his pretensions  but that   he should be careful how he let any one into the secret of his heart    She foresaw little prospect of their love ever being crown d with   success  yet found too much pleasure in indulging it to be able to wish   an extinction of it  either in him or herself  and in spight of all the   distance she assumed  he easily perceived that whatever difficulties he   should have to struggle with in the prosecution of his addresses  they   would not be owing to her cruelty  They were both of them too young to   attend much to consequences  and as securing the affections of each   other was what each equally aimed at  neither of them reflected how   terrible a separation would be  and how great the likelihood that it   must happen they knew not how soon       As the remonstrances of mademoiselle Charlotta had all the effect she   intended them for on Horatio  he so well commanding himself that no   person in the
