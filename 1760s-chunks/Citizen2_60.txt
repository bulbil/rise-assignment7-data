disciples into gravity  and guard them against the power of ridicule   When Philip the second was King of Spain  there was a contest in Salamanca between two orders of friars for superiority  The legend of one side contained more extraordinary miracles  but the legend of the other was reckoned most authentic  They reviled each other  as is usual in   186 disputes of divinity  the people were divided into factions  and a civil war appeared unavoidable  In order to prevent such an imminent calamity  the combatants were prevailed upon to submit their legions to the fiery trial  and that which came forth untouched by the fire was to have the victory  and to be honoured with a double share of reverence  Whenever the people flock to see a miracle  it is an hundred to one  but that they see a miracle  incredible therefore were the numbers that were gathered round upon this occasion  the friars on each side approached  and confidently threw their respective legends into the flames  when lo  to the utter disappointment of all the assembly  instead of a miracle  both legends were consumed  Nothing but thus turning both parties into contempt  could have prevented the effusion of blood  The people now laughed at their former folly  and wondered why they fell out  Adieu   LETTER CIX  To the same   THE English are at present employed in celebrating a feast which becomes general every seventh year  the Parliament of the nation being then dissolved and another appointed to be chosen  This solemnity falls infinitely short of our feast of the lanthorns in magnificence and splendour  it is also surpassed by others of the East in unanimity and pure devotion  but no festival in the world can compare with it for eating  Their eating indeed amazes me  Had I five hundred heads  and were each head furnished with brains  yet would they   187 all be insufficient to compute the number of cows  pigs  geese and turkies  which upon this occasion die for the good of their country   To say the truth  eating seems to make a grand ingredient in all English parties of zeal  business or amusement  When a Church is to be built  or an Hospital endowed  the Directors assemble  and instead of consulting upon it  they eat upon it  by which means the business goes forward with success  When the Poor are to be relieved  the officers appointed to dole out public charity  assemble and eat upon it  Nor has it ever been known  that they filled the bellies of the poor till they had previously satisfied their own  But in the election of Magistrates the people seem to exceed all bounds  the merits of a candidate are often measured by the number of his treats  his constituents assemble  eat upon him  and lend their applause  not to his integrity or sense  but the quantities of his beef and brandy   And yet I could forgive this people their plentiful meals on this occasion  as it is extremely natural for every man to eat a great deal when he gets it for nothing  but what amazes me is  that all this good living no way contributes to improve their good humour  On the contrary  they seem to lose their temper as they lose their appetites  every morsel they swallow  and every glass they pour down serves to encrease their animosity  Many an honest man  before as harmless as a tame rabbit  when loaded with a single election dinner  has become more dangerous than a charged culverin  Upon one of these occasions  I have actually seen a bloody minded Man Milliner sally   188 forth at the head of a mob  determined to face a desperate Pastry Cook  who was General of the opposite party   But you must not suppose they are without a pretext for thus beating each other  On the contrary  no man here is so uncivilized as to beat his neighbour without producing very sufficient reasons  One candidate  for instance  treats with gin  a spirit of their own manufacture  another  always drinks brandy imported from abroad  Brandy is a wholesome liquor  gin a liquor wholly their own  This then furnishes an obvious cause of quarrel  Whether it be most reasonable to get drunk with gin  or get drunk with brandy  The mob meet upon the debate  fight themselves sober  and then draw off to get drunk again  and charge for another encounter  So that the English may now properly be said to be engaged in war  since while they are subduing their enemies abroad  they are breaking each other s heads at home   I lately made an excursion to a neighbouring village  in order to be a spectator of the ceremonies practised upon this occasion  I left town in company with three fidlers  nine dozen of hams  and a corporation poet  which were designed as reinforcements to the gin drinking party  We entered the town with a very good face  the fidlers  no way intimidated by the enemy  kept handling their arms up the principal street  By this prudent manoeuvre they took peaceable possession of their head quarters  amidst the shouts of multitudes  who seemed perfectly rejoiced at hearing their music  but above all at seeing their bacon     189I must own I
