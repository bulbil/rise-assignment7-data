without consulting it  for you cannot imagine to what mean and trifling Offices good Sense will condescend to accompany us  and  perhaps  it is in what the World esteem Trifles  that a good Understanding should most employ itself  for great or extraordinary Occasions generally direct their own Operations     Henry   P  S  There is a Gentleman in the House where I am  at present  who has lately read his Recantation  in order to preserve an Estate of about 70 l  per Annum  He has a Brother at Bourdeaux  who is a beneficed Priest  from whom he received a Letter this Morning  so full of Fire and Brimstone  that it had almost thrown him into a Fit of Despair  But I had the good Fortune to quiet his Mind  after a Quarter of an Hour s Conversation  and he begged I would reduce my Reasoning upon this Subject into the Form of a Letter  which he would copy  and send to his Brother  I did so  and  as he has just done with it  I send you the Original inclosed   Dear Brother   I Received your religious Exhortation  and brotherly Admonition  which I must acknowledge Page  106 to be in the Stile of a Priest  but not in the Spirit of a Christian  both for the same Reason  that it so boldly and ignorantly denounces Damnation against those  who differ from you in controverted Opinions and Forms  even though  in Essentials  you should both agree  as if the God of the Universe was but a King of one Nation of Men  and declared War against all those  who refused to submit to the same Policy  This I speak  in general  with Regard to the uncharitable Sentiments of the whole Body of Christians  against the Professors of every other Worship  in the rest of the World  But  as to the Points in Question between you and me  let me fairly state the Case between us   We believe and adore the same God  and have the same Faith in the Trinity  We also observe the same Principles of Morality  hinted first to the antient Philosophers by the Light of Reason  and afterwards more fully illustrated  and made obvious to the meaner Capacities  by the divine Grace of Revelation  We both derive our Doctrines from the same Text of Holy Writ  and are  therefore  both of the one only true and universal Church   The only Difference  then  between us  is  that in the Infancy of Christianity  making it s Way through the Errors of Judaism and Heathenism  it necessarily contracted a great Page  107 deal of the Foulness of Superstition in it s Passage  and grew up incumbered with many idle Forms  and useless and absurd Ceremonies  which are by no Means authorized from Scripture  There was likewise a good deal of Timeserving in the first Preachers after the Apostles  for they were but Men  and the Grace of Inspiration ceased with the Apostles  These Men  then  finding it impossible to propagate this new Faith  pure and intire  against the superstitious Prejudices of antient and established Modes of Worship  at least with that Dispatch which their Zeal required  temporized with the Ceremonies and Idolatries of the Nations round them  in order to be the better received among them  They thought  perhaps  that  as this Religion was first established by the Power of Miracles  it must be maintained so  and then introduced that absurd and unphilosophical Doctrine of Transubstantiation  They thought too  that to give Men Hopes of a Redemption  even after Death  and by the Merit of another s Devotion  would naturally allure them to the Embracing this new Faith  and so published the Doctrine of Supererogation  which unluckily contradicts another  broached at the same Time  of Purgatory  in the most express Manner  as the last supposes  that no Person can be virtuous or religious enough to save his Soul intire  before he dies  therefore must necessarily pass Page  108 through a Purgation  and the other supposes  that a Man may not only perform sufficient Acts to secure himself  but the Overplus of his Merits may go toward the Salvation of another  This Contradiction puts me in Mind of the old saying  that   Lyars should have good Memories   Now you are drinking from the polluted Stream  while we have recurred up to the pure Fountain  and original Source  Our Religion is deduced from the plain Text of the Scriptures  your s from the sophistical Comments of the Priests  When a Priest once asked a Protestant  where his Religion was before Luther  he answered humourously  but not less justly  by asking him  where was his Face before it was washed     As for your Doctrine of seven Sacraments  which you say we are deficient in  I answer  that we receive the Essence of them all in our two  and the fewer Heads any Proposition is divided into  the less Confusion there will be in the Comprehension of it   In short  you seem to have more of the Subtilties of the Schools  in your Reasoning  than the Purity of Religion  which  the more simple it is  is the more divine   What
