nay  even the insidious cat was seen to scamper  A lounging mastiff  however  happened to pass by  and thought it no harm if he should lap a little of the water  as he was thirsty  The guardian goose flew at him like a fury  pecked at him with her beak  and slapped him with her feathers  The dog grew angry  had twenty times a good mind to give her a sly snap  but suppressing his indignation  because his master was nigh  A pox take thee  cries he  for a fool  sure those who have neither strength nor weapons to fight  at least should be civil  that fluttering and hissing of thine may one day get thine   268 head snapt off  but it can neither injure thy enemies  or ever protect thee  So saying  he went forward to the pond  quenched his thirst  in spite of the goose  and followed his master   Another obstruction to the fortune of youth is  that while they are willing to take offence from none  they are also equally desirous of giving none offence  From hence they endeavour to please all  comply with every request  attempt to suit themselves to every company  have no will of their own  but like wax catch every contiguous impression  By thus attempting to give universal satisfaction  they at last find themselves miserably disappointed  to bring the generality of admirers on our side  it is sufficient to attempt pleasing a very few   A painter of eminence was once resolved to finish a piece which should please the whole world  When  therefore  he had drawn a picture  in which his utmost skill was exhausted  it was exposed in the public market place  with directions at the bottom for every spectator to mark with a brush  which lay by  every limb  and feature  which seemed erroneous  The spectators came  and in general applauded  but each  willing to shew his talent at criticism  marked whatever he thought proper  As evening  when the painter came  he was mortified to find the whole picture one universal blot  not a single stroke that was not stigmatized with marks of disapprobation  not satisfied with this trial  the next day he was resolved to try them in a different manner  and exposing his picture as before  desired that every spectator would mark those beauties he approved or admired    269 The people complied  and the artist returning  found his picture replete with the marks of beauty  every stroke that had been yesterday condemned now received the character of approbation  Well  cries the painter  I now find that the best way to please one half of the world  is not to mind what the other half says  since what are faults in the eyes of these  shall be by those regarded as beauties  Adieu   LETTER LIX  From the same   A Character  such as you have represented that of your fair companion  which continues virtuous  though loaded with infamy  is truly great  Many regard virtue because it is attended with applause  your favourite only for the internal pleasure it confers  I have often wished that ladies like her were proposed as models for female imitation  and not such as have acquired fame by qualities repugnant to the natural softness of the sex   Women famed for their valour  their skill in politics  or their learning  leave the duties of their own sex  in order to invade the privileges of ours  I can no more pardon a fair one for endeavouring to wield the club of Hercules  than I could him for attempting to twirl her distaff   The modest virgin  the prudent wife  or the careful matron are much more serviceable in life than   270 petticoated philosophers  blustering heroines  or virago queens  She who makes her husband and her children happy  who reclaims the one from vice  and trains up the other to virtue  is a much greater character than ladies described in romance  whose whole occupation is to murder mankind with shafts from their quiver or their eyes   Women  it has been observed  are not naturally formed for great cares themselves but to soften ours  Their tenderness is the proper reward for the dangers we undergo for their preservation  and the ease and chearfulness of their conversation  o•r desirable retreat from the fatigues of intense application  They are confined within the narrow limits of domestic assiduity  and when they stray beyond them  they move beyond their sphere  and consequently without grace   Fame therefore has been very unjustly dispensed  among the female sex  Those who least deserved to be remembered  meet our admiration and applause  while many  who have been an honour to humanity  are passed over in silence  Perhaps no age has produced a stronger instance of misplaced fame than the present  the Semiramis and the Thalestris of antiquity are talked of  while a modern character  infinitely greater than either  is unnoticed and unknown    Catherina Alexowna  born near Derpat  a little city in Livonia  was heir to no other inheritance than the virtues and frugality of her parents  Her father being dead  she
