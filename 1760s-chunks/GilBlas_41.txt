you must not make your appearance there without an establishment  There  as elsewhere  people judge by the outside  and you will only be respected according to the figure you make  I will find you a servant  a tried domestic  a prudent lad  in a word  a fellow of my own creation  Buy a couple of mules  one for yourself  the other for him  and set off as fast as you can   This counsel was too palatable to be refused  On the day following I purchased two fine mules  and bargained with my new servant  He was a young man of thirty  of a very simple and godly appearance  He told me he was a native of Galicia  by name Ambrose de Lamela  Other servants are selfish  and think they never can have wages enough  This fellow assured me he was a man of few wants  and should be contented with whatever I had the goodness to give him  I bought a pair of boots  with a portmanteau to lock up my linen and my money  Having settled with my landlord  I set out from Burgos the next morning before sun  rise  on my way to Madrid       CH  XVI     Showing that prosperity will slip through a man s fingers   WE slept at Duengnas the first night  and reached Valladolid on the following day  about four o clock in the afternoon  We alighted at the inn of the most respectable appearance in the town  I left the care of the mules to my fellow  and went up to a room whither I ordered my portmanteau to be carried by a waiter  As I felt a little weary  I threw myself on a couch in my boots  and fell asleep involuntarily  It was almost night when I awoke  I called for Ambrose  He was not to be found in the house  but made his appearance in a short time  I asked him where he had been  he answered in his godly way  that he was just come from church  whither he went for the purpose of thanksgiving  by reason that we had been graciously preserved from all perils and dangers between Burgos and Valladolid  I commended his piety  and ordered a chicken to be roasted for supper   At the moment when I was giving this order  my landlord came into my room with a light in his hand  That cursed candle served to introduce a lady  handsome  but not young  and very richly attired  She leant upon an usher  none of the youngest  and a little blackamoor was her train bearer  I was under no small surprise when this fair incognita  with a profound obeisance  begged to know if my name might happen to be Signor Gil Blas of Santillane  I had no sooner blundered out yes  than she released her sweet hand from the custody of the usher  and embraced me with a transport of joy  of which I knew less and less what to make  Heaven be praised  cried she  for all its mercies  You are he  noble sir  the very man of whom I was in quest  By this introduction I was reminded of my friend the parasite at Pegnaflor  and was on the point of suspecting the lady to be no better than an honest woman should be  but her finale gave me a much higher opinion of her  I am  continued she  first cousin to Donna Mencia de Mosquera  whom you have so greatly befriended  It was but this morning I received a letter from her  She writes me word that having learnt your intention of going to Madrid  she wished me to receive you hospitably on your journey  if you went this way  For these two hours have I been parading the town  From inn to inn have I gone to inform myself what strangers were in the house  and I gathered from the landlord s description that you were most likely to have been my cousin s deliverer  Since then I have found you out  you shall know by experience my gratitude to the friends of my family  and especially to my dear cousin s hero  You will take up your abode  if you please  at my house  Your accommodations will be better  I wished to excuse myself  and told the lady that I could not be so troublesome  but her importunities were more than a match for my modesty  A carriage was waiting at the door of the inn to convey us  She saw my portmanteau taken care of with her own eyes  because  as she justly observed  there were a great many light fingered gentry about Valladolid    to be sure there were a great many light  fingered gentry about Valladolid  as she justly observed  In short  I got into the carriage with her and the old usher  and suffered myself to be carried off bodily from the inn  to the great annoyance of the landlord  who saw himself thus weaned from all the little perquisites he had reckoned on from my abode under his roof   Our carriage  having rolled on some distance  stopped  We alighted at the door of a handsome house  and went up stairs into a well furnished apartment  illuminated
