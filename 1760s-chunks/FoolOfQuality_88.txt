his   Harry on the other   while the praise of this chosen of the old   gentleman s soul sunk  like the balm of Gilead  upon his wounded   mind  and almost eradicated every memorial of former grief  and   planted a new spring of hope and joy in their room      The table being spread for dinner  Mr  Fenton sent to desire the   stranger and his little family should join company  They came    according to order   but entered  evidently overcome by a weight of   shame and gratitude too grievous to be borne      Mr  Fenton saw their oppression  and felt the whole burden upon   his own shoulders  He accordingly was interested and solicitous   in its removal  which he effected with all that address of which his   humanity had made him a finished master      Through the enfoldings of the stranger s modesty  Mr  Fenton   discerned many things preceding the vulgar rank of men  Mr    Clement  said he  I am astonished beyond measure that a person   of letters  as you are  and who has so much of the gentleman in his   person and manner  should yet be reduced to such an extremity   in a Christian country  and among a people distinguished for their   humanity  There must be something very singular and extra    ordinary in your case   and this night  if you are at leisure  and   that the recital is not disagreeable to you  you would oblige me   by your story      Sir  answered Mr  Clement  since my life is yours  you have   surely a right to an account of your property  Whenever you   think proper  I will cheerfully obey you      Mr  Fenton now rose and stepped into town  and calling upon a         66 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      neighbour  whom he took to the tavern  he sent for Mr  Vindex    who came upon the summons      Mr  Vindex  says he  pray take your seat  I am sorry  Mr    Vindex  for the treatment you have got in my house  and still   sorrier that you got it so very deservedly      I have long thought  Mr  Vindex  that the method of school    masters  in the instruction of our children  is altogether the   reverse of what it ought to be  They generally lay hold on the   human constitution  as a pilot lays hold on the rudder of a ship    by the tail  by the single motive of fear alone      Now  as fear has no concern with any thing but itself  it is   the most confined  most malignant  and the basest  though the   strongest  of all passions      The party who is possessed with it  will listen to nothing but   the dictates of his own terror  nor scruple any thing that may   cover him from the evil apprehended  He will prevaricate and   lie  if that lie is questioned  he will vouch it by perjury  and    if he happens to do an injury  he will be tempted to commit murder   to prevent the effects of resentment      Fear never was a friend to the love of God or man  to duty or   conscience  truth  probity  or honour  It therefore can never make   a good subject  a good citizen  or a good soldier  and  least of all    a good Christian   except the devils  who believe and tremble  are   to be accounted good Christians      How very different is the lesson which our master CHRIST   teacheth  who commandeth us not to fear what man can do unto   us   to smile at sickness and calamity   to rise superior to pain and   death   and to regard nothing  but as it leads to the goal of that   immortality which his gospel has brought to light       There is  Mr  Vindex  but one occasion wherein fear may be   useful in schools or commonwealths   and that is  when it is placed   as a guard against evil  and appears  with its insignia of rods  ropes    and axes  to deter all who behold from approaching thereto      But this  Mr  Vindex  is far from being the sole occasion on   which schoolmasters apply the motive of fear and castigation    They associate the ideas of pain to those lessons and virtues which   the pleasure of encouragement ought alone to inculcate   they yet   more frequently apply the lash for the indulgence of their own   weaknesses  and for tne gratification of the virulence of their
