more I ll venture  God direct my   footsteps  and make smooth my path and my way to safety          Well  here I am  come back again  frightened  like a fool  out of all my   purposes  O how terrible every thing appears to me  I had got twice as   far again  as I was before  out of the back door  and I looked and saw   the bull  as I thought  between me and the door  and another bull coming   towards me the other way  Well  thought I  here is double witchcraft  to   be sure  Here is the spirit of my master in one bull  and Mrs  Jewkes s   in the other  And now I am gone  to be sure  O help  cried I  like a   fool  and ran back to the door  as swift as if I flew  When I had got   the door in my hand  I ventured to look back  to see if these supposed   bulls were coming  and I saw they were only two poor cows  a grazing in   distant places  that my fears had made all this rout about  But as every   thing is so frightful to me  I find I am not fit to think of my escape    for I shall be as much frightened at the first strange man that I meet   with  and I am persuaded that fear brings one into more dangers  than   the caution  that goes along with it  delivers one from       I then locked the door  and put the key in my pocket  and was in a sad   quandary  but I was soon determined  for the maid Nan came in sight    and asked  if any thing was the matter  that I was so often up and down   stairs  God forgive me   but I had a sad lie at my tongue s end   said   I  Though Mrs  Jewkes is sometimes a little hard upon me  yet I know not   where I am without her  I go up  and I come down to walk about in the   garden  and  not having her  know scarcely what to do with myself  Ay    said the ideot  she is main good company  madam  no wonder you miss her          So here I am again  and here likely to be  for I have no courage to help   myself any where else  O why are poor foolish maidens tried with such   dangers  when they have such weak minds to grapple with them   I   will  since it is so  hope the best  but yet I cannot but observe how   grievously every thing makes against me  for here are the robbers    though I fell not into their hands myself  yet they gave me as much   terror  and had as great an effect upon my fears  as if I had  And here   is the bull  it has as effectually frightened me  as if I had been hurt   by it instead of the cook maid  and so these joined together  as I may   say  to make a very dastard of me  But my folly was the worst of all    because that deprived me of my money  for had I had that  I believe I   should have ventured both the bull and the robbers          Monday afternoon       So  Mrs  Jewkes is returned from her visit  Well  said she  I would have   you set your heart at rest  for Mr  Williams will do very well again  He   is not half so bad as he fancied  O these scholars  said she  they have   not the hearts of mice  He has only a few scratches on his face  which    said she  I suppose he got by grappling among the gravel at the bottom   of the dam  to try to find a hole in the ground  to hide himself from   the robbers  His shin and his knee are hardly to be seen to ail any   thing  He says in his letter  he was a frightful spectacle  He might be   so  indeed  when he first came in a doors  but he looks well enough now    and  only for a few groans now and then  when he thinks of his danger    I see nothing is the matter with him  So  Mrs  Pamela  said she  I would   have you be very easy about it  I am glad of it  said I  for all your   jokes  to Mrs  Jewkes       Well  said she  he talks of nothing but you  and when I told him I would   fain
