What a miserable situation must our earth be in without his enlivening ray  Have we not seen several neighbouring suns entirely disappear  Has not a fixed star  near the tail of the Ram  lately been quite extinguished   Thursday  The comet has not yet appeared  I am sorry for it  first  sorry because my calculation is false  secondly  sorry lest the sun should want fuel  thirdly  sorry lest the wits should laugh at our erroneous predictions  and fourthly  sorry because if it appears to night  it must necessarily come within the sphere of the earth s attraction  and heaven help the unhappy country on which it happens to fall   Friday  Our whole society have been out all eager in search of the comet  We have seen not less   118 than sixteen comets in different parts of the heavens  However  we are unanimously resolved to fix upon one only to be the comet expected  That near Virgo wants nothing but a tail to fit it out completely for terrestrial admiration   Saturday  The moon is I find at her old pranks  Her appulses  librations  and other irregularities  indeed amaze me  My daughter too is this morning gone off with a grenadier  No way surprizing  I was never able to give her a relish for wisdom  She ever promised to be a mere expletive in the creation  But the moon  the moon gives me real uneasiness  I fondly fancied I had fixed her  I had thought her constant  and constant only to me  but every night discovers her infidelity  and proves me a desolate and abandoned lover   Adieu   LETTER XC  To the same   IT is surprizing what an influence titles shall have upon the mind  even though these titles be of our own making  Like children we dress up the puppets in finery  and then stand in astonishment at the plastic wonder  I have been told of a rat catcher here  who strolled for a long time about the villages near town  without finding any employment  at last  however  he thought proper to take the title of his Majesty s Rat catcher in ordinary  and this succeeded beyond his expectations  when it was known that he caught rats at   119 court  all were ready to give him countenance and employment   But of all the people  they who make books seem most perfectly sensible of the advantage of titular dignity  All seem convinced  that a book written by vulgar hands  can neither instruct nor improve  none but Kings  Chams  and Mandarines  can write with any probability of success  If the titles inform me right  not only Kings and Courtiers  but Emperors themselves in this country  periodically supply the press   A man here who should write  and honestly confess that he wrote for bread  might as well send his manuscript to fire the baker s oven  not one creature will read him  all must be court bred poets  or pretend at least to be court bred  who can expect to please  Should the caitiff fairly avow a design of emptying our pockets and filling his own  every reader would instantly forsake him  even those  who write for bread themselves  would combine to worry him  perfectly sensible  that his attempts only served to take the bread out of their mouths   And yet this silly prepossession the more amazes me  when I consider  that almost all the excellent productions in wit that have appeared here  were purely the offspring of necessity  their Drydens  Butlers  Otways  and Farquhars  were all writers for bread  Believe me  my friend  hunger has a most amazing faculty of sharpening the genius  and he who with a full belly  can think like a hero  after a course of fasting  shall rise to the sublimity of a demi god     120But what will most amaze  is  that this very set of men  who are now so much depreciated by fools  are however the very best writers they have among them at present  For my own part  were I to buy an hat  I would not have it from a stocking maker  but an hatter  were I to buy shoes  I should not go to the taylor s for that purpose  It is just so with regard to wit  did I  for my life  desire to be well served  I would apply only to those who made it their trade  and lived by it  You smile at the oddity of my opinion  but be assured  my friend  that wit is in some measure mechanical  and that a man long habituated to catch at even its resemblance  will at last be happy enough to possess the substance  by a long habit of writing he acquires a justness of thinking  and a mastery of manner  which holiday writers  even with ten times his genius  may vainly attempt to equal   How then are they deceived  who expect from title  dignity  and exterior circumstance  an excellence  which is in some measure acquired by habit  and sharpened by necessity  you have seen  like me  many literary reputations promoted by the influence of fashion  which have scarce survived the possessor
