 Some of them painful ones   Signior Marsigli  as he is called  and the two young Lords  dined with them  This being a first visit on my part  we made it a short one  We went from them to Lady G s  and drank tea with her and her Lord  Sir Charles could not bear  he said  to go immediately from the sighing parents to the sorrowing daughter  they not knowing  nor being at present to know  she was so near them   Lady G  was so petulant  so whimsical  when her   168 brother s back was turned  that I could not forbear blaming her  But I let her go her own way  She stopt my mouth—   So you think you shall behave more patiently  more thankfully  in the same circumstance —Look to it  Harriet      Here  my dearest grandmamma  I will conclude this Letter  Pray for the poor Clementina  for a happy reconciliation  and that the result may be tranquillity of mind restored to this whole noble family  so necessary to that of your dear Sir Charles  and  His and Your HARRIET GRANDISON   LETTER XXXVI  Lady GRANDISON  In Continuation   Thursday  March 22   NOthing decisive yet  my dear grandmamma   There have been some generous contentions between the family and Sir Charles  He has besought them to make their hearts easy  and he will comply with all their reasonable desires   They think not of dining with  or visiting us  till they can hear some tidings of their beloved daughter   Lord G  Lord L  and Lady L  as also Mrs  Eleanor Grandison  have been presented to them   Sir Charles has begun to enter into a treaty  as I may call it  with the Lady on one part  her Family on the second  and the Count of Belvedere on the third  Lady Clementina  it seems  insists upon being allowed to take the veil  and that in a manner that sometimes carries wildness with it  The Bishop  Sir Charles thinks  seems less fervent in his opposition to it  than formerly  Father Marescotti  in his heart  he believes  favours her wishes  But the Marquis and Marchioness  and Signor Jeronymo  plead their own inclinations  their Son the General s unabated fervor    169 in behalf of the marriage  were it but to secure the performance of the grandfather s will  and to be an effectual disappointment of the interested hopes of Lady Sforza and her daughter Laurana  The Count of Belvedere s passion for the Lady  notwithstanding her unhappy malady past  and apprehended  makes a great merit for him with the family  and the two young Lords think so highly of him for his perseverance  that they are attached to his interest  and declare  that the Conte della Porretta their father is as strongly on the same side as the General himself   In the mean time  the fond mother is so impatient to see her daughter  that they are afraid of the consequences  as to health both of mind and body  if a speedy determination be not come to  On the other hand  the young Lady grieves to find herself  as she says  in such a situation  as to be obliged to insist on conditions with her parents  before she can throw herself at their feet  which she longs to do  tho  she dreads to see them  Sometimes  and they are when she is calmest  she blames herself for the step she has taken  at others  she endeavours to find excuses for it   Sunday morning  Mar  25   SIR Charles has drawn up a paper at the request of all parties  He last night gave a copy of it to the Lady  another to the Count  a third to the Bishop  for them all to consider of the contents  and he will attend them to morrow for their answer  He has been pleased to give me also a copy of it  which is as follows   I  That Lady Clementina  in obedience to the will of her two deceased grandfathers  in duty to her parents and uncle  and in compliance with the earnest supplications of the most affectionate of brothers  shall engage her honour to give up all thoughts of withdrawing from the world    170 not only for the present  but for all future time  so long as she shall remain in her maiden state   II  She shall be at liberty to choose her way of Life  and shall be allowed  at her own pleasure  to visit her Brother and his Lady at Naples  her Uncle at Urbino  Mrs  Beaumont at Florence  and be put into the immediate perception of the profits of the estate bequeathed to her  if she chooses it  that she may be enabled to do that extensive good with the produce  that she could not do  were she to renounce the world  in which case  that estate would devolve to one  who  it is but too probable  would make a very different use of it   III  She shall have the liberty of nominating her own attendants  and in case
