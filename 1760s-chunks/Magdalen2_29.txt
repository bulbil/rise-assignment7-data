to the care of Sally  the young woman of whom I have been just speaking  and wished me  in a very affectionate manner  a good morning  Before they withdrew  however  I begged to speak to my worthy friend  Mrs  Dobson  in a private room  the good woman readily indulged my request  and  if I might judge by the benignity which enlightened her honest countenance    170 she came with the more readiness  from a supposition that I stood in farther need of her services  When we were alone    My dear Mrs  Dobson   says I   you have eternally obliged me  you have been my preserver—my guardian angel—but I shall be the most miserable creature in the world  unless you kindly accept this trifle  endeavouring to squeeze five guineas into her hand  for a pair of gloves    Madam   replied the generous Mrs  Dobson  in a stile much above her condition   I am no way sorry that you make me this offer  because it confirms my good opinion of you—but I should think very meanly of myself  if I was capable of taking a reward for performing a common act of humanity —God bless you  my sweet young lady   continued she  kissing my cheek   and send you a happy meeting with your friends —While you stay here  every thing will be at your service  I dare say  and  humble   171 as we are in the world  be assured you have fallen among people  who would rather confer obligations  than receive them   Oh  Harriot  these are the persons whom your great ones look upon with contempt—these are the persons whom the insolence of the opulence or pomp so frequently considers as little superior to the merely animal creation  yet see by what souls they are informed —The mind of this woman  my dear  would have done honour to a coronet  yet how many women are there with coronets  who would shed the smallest degree of credit upon her cart     After the departure of the two industrious sisters  Sally  to whose care I was consigned  advised me  in a very pretty manner  to lie down  insisting upon helping me to undress  and begging I would consider myself at home in their family  I complied with Sally s   172 obliging intreaties  and accordingly went to bed  but  alas  my dear  I awoke in a high fever  and was actually delirious before the good young woman s mother returned from market  By the excess of the worthy people s tenderness  and care of an excellent apothecary  who  it seems  attended that admirable institution called the Magdalen  about which you and I have so frequently talked in the country  I was  in as short a time as possible  recovered from my illness —but  though my health was re established  my mind was totally unhinged —The numberless distresses which I had of late sustained  joined to the consciousness of having been the original author of every misfortune myself  was too much for me  Ignorant whether my brother was living or dead—satisfied that my poor father and mother must be torn by the sharpest of all anxieties—and convinced that my Harriot herself must have given me up as a lost abandoned   173 creature  I was continually raving about my fall  and wishing for some asylum  where I might waste out the remainder of my days in penitence for my sin  Instead  therefore  of desiring ing to write to those who would interest themselves in my behalf  I looked upon the whole world as my irreconcileable enemy  yet  though I incessantly raved  I was  nevertheless  apparently calm  and perfectly consistent  It was in vain that poor Mrs  Dobson  the honest woman  her sister  and the whole family  opposed my resolution of entering the Magdalen  it was in vain that they assured me of a perpetual asylum with them—I continued inflexible  and what was the absolute result of my delirium  they  who could naturally judge by nothing but appearances  set down as the consequence of premeditated determination  so that at last they consented  and I was received  though with some essential deviations  from the customary mode   174 of accepting Penitents  the good apothecary managing matters with as much delicacy as could be wished  I have since  however  learned  that  had any of Hastings s people remained about Hampstead  to satisfy Mrs  Dobson s enquiries  or could she have prevailed on me to give any account of myself after my illness  I never should have entered this place  But Sir Harry s house  it seems  being entirely burnt down  the whole family was removed  before her enquiries began  and I was so strenuously bent upon my scheme  that I evaded an answer to her questions to myself  with a degree of cunning almost wonderful in my circumstances   I have now  my dear Harriot  been in this house above three months  and find that my little understanding is as well established as my health —I have  therefore  employed myself for some   175 time in drawing up the foregoing account for your information  and submit it entirely to your own discretion  either
