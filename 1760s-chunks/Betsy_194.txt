from herself alone you must receive it     She shewed me a letter from   you  Sir   cried Mr  Francis  hastily   That might then suffice to   inform you   answered Mr  Trueworth   that in what I have done  I but   obeyed the dictates of my honour     Honour   cried the other  fiercely    and laying his hand on his sword   What is it you mean  Sir  Did honour   oppose your marriage with my sister         No menaces   said Mr  Trueworth  with a gravity which was pretty near   disdain   you know me incapable of fear  I have fought for your sister    but will never fight against her  I injure not her reputation  on the   contrary  I would defend it  if unjustly attacked  even at the hazard of   my life  but as to love or marriage  these are things now out of the   question  we both  perhaps  have other views  and the less is said of   what is past is the better        Mr  Francis naturally took fire on the least suspicion of an indignity   offered to him  but when once convinced of his mistake  was no less   ready to repent and acknowledge it  he had seen many instances of the   honour  generosity  and sincerity of Mr  Trueworth  he had also been   witness of some of the levity and inconsiderateness of his sister  and   the reflection of a moment served to make him see this change had   happened merely through her own ill conduct       His rage abated even while the other was speaking  but a deep concern   remained behind  and  throwing himself down in a chair   Into what   vexations   cried he   may not a whole family be plunged  through the   indiscretion of one woman         Judge not too rashly   said Mr  Trueworth   Miss Betsy may one day see   a man so happy as to inspire her with sentiments far different from   those she hitherto has entertained  and she also may be more happy   herself  with a man who loves her with less delicacy than I did        The brother of Miss Betsy seemed not to take any notice of these words    but  rising in some confusion   Well  Sir   said he   I shall trouble   you no more upon this subject  and am sorry I have done it now   Mr    Trueworth then told him  that though the intended alliance between them   was broke off  he saw no occasion that their friendship should be so   too  that he should be glad of an opportunity to return the favours he   had received from him  in relation to his sister  though his endeavours   on that score had not met with the desired success  and that he hoped   they should not live as strangers while they continued in the same town    to all this Mr  Franics made but very short replies  either taking what   he said as words of course  or because the disorder of his own mind   would not permit him to prolong the conversation       It is likely Mr  Trueworth was not much troubled at the hasty leave this   young gentleman took  for though he always had a very sincere regard for   him  yet the point on which he now had come  was tender  and could not   be touched upon without giving him some pain  he had no time  however    to make many reflections on the conversation that had passed between   them  A letter was brought him by a porter who  waiting for an answer    he immediately opened it  and found the contents as follows             To Charles Trueworth  Esq            Sir            Extraordinary merits seldom fail of having as extraordinary        effects  you have made a conquest of a heart without knowing it         which not the utmost endeavours of any other could ever subdue  I        am commissioned to acquaint you  that a lady of some consideration        in the world  and a large fortune in her own hands  thinks you        alone deserve to be the master both of that and of herself  but as        she is apprehensive of your being already engaged  begs you will be        so generous as to confess the truth  that  if so  she may put a
