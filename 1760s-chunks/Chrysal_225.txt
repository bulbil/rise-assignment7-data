   The situation of his mind when  upon his coming up to the general    he heard the victory was won  may be better conceived than de    scribed  The cool  distant reception he met with gave him notice of   the storm which was ready to burst over his head  and he saw that   the scheme he had laid so deeply to perpetrate the ruin of another   had inevitably worked his own  as the very accusations which he   had intended to bring against his general would now recoil upon   himself with tenfold force  According to his fears  the general   next morning publicly passed an implicit censure on his conduct    which he saw received with such universal approbation  that he   thought it proper to resign his command  for fear of personal insult   from the incensed soldiers  and return home  where he did not doubt   but the interest of his family and his own eloquence and address   would vindicate his character  at least  if not still accomplish his     1 The second line of cavalry  under the Marquis of Granby  made a   vigorous charge  though too late to complete the rout of the French  who   were  however  afterwards cut up by 10 000 men sent by Ferdinand   against their communications          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 257     deaigna against the general  Though I lost sight of him at this time    yet  as I had an opportunty afterwards of coming to the knowledge   of the whole affair  I think it better  and less trouble to us both    to continue the account here  than break my narrative with it in   another place      The first construction which was put upon his conduct was that   it proceeded from cowardice  an opinion which the cruelty of his   temper to those under his command gave no small weight to  from   this generally just maxim  that the cruel are always cowards    and which many insignificant parts of his former conduct were   alleged to confirm  But I have shown that it sprang from another   much less justifiable cause   I say less justifiable  as cowardice is   a natural infirmity  which a man is no more accountable for   than for his being born blind or lame   but such a scheme as   his was a premeditated crime  and aggravated with the blackest   circumstances      The first consequence of his quitting the army was a perfect   harmony between the English and Germans  the glory they had   acquired upon this occasion raising the spirits of the former so high   that they thought no more of the inconveniences they had com    plained of before  but readily followed the example of their new   commander  1 whom they all loved  and entered into friendship with   their fellow soldiers  as if there had never been any jealousy between   them  who  on the other hand  were so struck with their gallant   behaviour  and so sensible of the advantages gained by it  that they   no longer accused them of improper delicacy  or strove to do them   ill offices with the natives of the country as before  But what   completed the happiness of the English  was the commander in    chief s indulging their natural thirst for glory under their present   commander  by giving them the post of honour upon all occasions    and taking public notice of their valour  the honour of which they   esteemed a sufficient recompense for the severest fatigues and   dangers  an indulgence which it was not in his power to give before    as their late commander had always opposed their being exposed   to danger  out of an afiected regard to them  as if they were of   greater consequence than the rest of the army  or joined it only to   make a figure  and not to do any service      As soon as the late general arrived in England  his sovereign    who had been informed of the whole affair  immediately deprived   him of his many very lucrative and honourable employments  and   dismissed him his service  an instance of clemency which few other   princes would have shown  and which regard to the merits of his   illustrious ancestors alone procured for ham  But so far was he   from having a proper sense of this lenity  or acquiescing in the   sentence of his sovereign  that he loudly asserted his being wronged    and demanded a trial to vindicate his character  with all the assurance   of conscious innocence      This was the highest insult that could be offered to a prince  as it   impeached his justice  and questioned his power in the tenderest      â   The Marquis of Granby  who also led the British troops at the
