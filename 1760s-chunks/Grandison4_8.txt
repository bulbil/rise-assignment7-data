had at and after dinner  their minds opened  and their characters rose upon me  Lord W  will be charmed with Miss Mansfield  I am delighted to think  that my mother s brother will be happy  in the latter part of his life  with a wife of so much prudence and goodness  as I am sure this Lady will make him  On one instance of her very obliging behaviour to me  I whispered her sister  Pray  Miss Fanny  tell Miss Mansfield  but not till I am gone  that she knows not the inconveniencies she is bringing upon herself  I may  perhaps  hereafter  have the boldness  to look for   19 the same favour from my aunt  that I meet with from Miss Mansfield   If my sister  returned she  should ever misbehave to her benefactor  I will deny my relation to her   I promised to write to Lady Mansfield as soon as I heard from my Lord  and parted with them  followed by the blessings of them all   You will soon have another letter from me  with an account of the success of my visit to Sir Harry Beauchamp and his Lady  We must have our Beauchamp among us  my dear friend  I should rather say  you must among you  for I shall not be long in England  He will supply to you  my dear Dr  Bartlett  the absence  it will not  I hope be a long one  of  Your CHARLES GRANDISON    SIR Charles  I remember  as the Doctor read  mentions getting leave for his Beauchamp to come over  who  he says  will supply his absence to him—But  ah  Lucy  Who  let me have the boldness to ask  shall supply it to your Harriet  Time  my dear  will do nothing for me  except I could hear something very much amiss of this man   I have a great suspicion  that the first part of the letter inclosed was about me  The doctor looked so earnestly at me  when he skipt two sides of it  and  as I thought  with so much compassion —To be sure  it was about me  What would I give to know as much of his mind as Dr  Bartlett knows  If I thought he pitied the poor Harriet—I should scorn myself  I am  I will be  above his pity  Lucy  In this believe  Your HARRIET BYRON     20  LETTER III  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   Sunday Night  April 2   DR  Bartlett has received from Sir Charles an account of what passed last Friday between him  and Sir Harry  and Lady Beauchamp  By the doctor s allowance  I inclose it to you   In this Letter  Lucy  you will see him in a new light  and as a man whom there is no resisting  when he resolves to carry a point But it absolutely convinces me  of what indeed I before suspected  that he has not an high opinion of our Sex in general  And this I will put down as a blot in his character  He treats us  in Lady Beauchamp  as perverse humoursome babies  loving power  yet not knowing how to use it  See him so delicate in his behaviour and address to Miss Mansfield  and carry in your thoughts his gaiety and adroit management to Lady Beauchamp  as in this letter  and you will hardly think him the same man  Could he be any thing to me  I should be more than half afraid of him  Yet this may be said in his behalf —He but accommodates himself to the persons he has to deal with —He can be a man of gay wit  when he pleases to descend  as indeed his sister Charlotte has as often found  as she has given occasion for the exercise of that talent in him —and  that virtue  for its own sake  is his choice  since had he been a free liver  he would have been a dangerous man  But I will not anticipate too much  Read it here  if you please     21  LETTER IV  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  To Dr  BARTLETT    Inclosed in the preceding    Grandison Hall  Friday Night  March 31   I Arrived at Sir Harry Beauchamp s about twelve this day  He and his Lady expected me  from the letter which I wrote and shewed you before I left the town  in which  you know  I acquainted Sir Harry with his son s earnest desire to throw himself at his feet  and to pay his duty to his mother  in England  and engaged to call myself  either this day or to morrow  for an answer   Sir Harry received me with great civility  and even affection  Lady Beauchamp  said he  will be with us in a moment  I am afraid you will not meet with all the civility from her on the errand you are come upon  that a man of Sir Charles Grandison s character deserves to meet with from all the world  We have been unhappy together  ever since we had your Letter  I long to see my son  Your friendship for
