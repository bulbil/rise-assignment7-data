  They set out with a suitable equipage and a nominal tutor    whom they engaged  rather with a view of being a watch upon   our young lord s motions  than the intendant of his principles or   the former of his manners          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  335     Nothing material happened till their arrival at Paris  where the   earl took a sumptuous palace in the Kue de Vaugirard      When he had settled his household  he went to inquire after   his intimates of fifty years ago  Some three or four of them still   survived  He renewed his acquaintance with them  and engaged   them  their friends and families  to rich and frequent entertain    ments  whereby his palace speedily became the resort of one of   the most elegant circles in Paris      Young Clinton quickly entered into familiarity and confidence   with such of the young nobility as frequented his father s   and   they took him abroad on several parties of pleasure  and introduced   him to the birds of their own distinguished feather      Our young Englishman swam gracefully down the stream of   pleasure   a warm imagination susceptible of the slightest im    pressions  a spirit apt to receive and impart the kindliest feelings    made him the idol of his home  and the desire of the brilliant   society he moved in and adorned  But  alas for the stability of   all earthly bliss  he was seized with the smallpox  which was   then sweeping through Paris like a plague  and  though the   eruption was but slight  yet on the seventh day Lord Clinton was   suddenly taken with convulsions  and in less than an hour expired      The old countess had never left his room since he had taken   to his bed  and was now carried off in a deep swoon  She never   after recovered her senses except by deplorable starts  to lament   that she was the most wretched of all that ever was created  and   on the second day she also expired      The miserable earl  now an unit in creation  had their bodies   embalmed and deposited in leaden coffins  ready for conveyance   to his own vault in England  whither he now prepared to go      At length he set out with his sighing and silent train   and after   a voyage  lengthened by woe  arrived finally at Enfield      Never was seen such a concourse at any funeral since the funeral   of Jacob  on which all Egypt attended  they crowded from a   distance of thirty miles round  But when they saw the old and   reverend patron of the country all covered with sad and solemn   weeds  when they beheld his countenance exceeding all pomp   of sorrow  and conceived the weight and wringing that was then   at his heart  envy was quite blunted and robbed of its sting    They now lamented the living more than they mo irned the dead     and the poorest among the poor looked down with an eye of   compassion upon the great man  now rendered  as they deemed    more pitiable and desolate even than themselves   without child   or kindred   without any to continue his name or his honours     without any who could claim a share in his wealth or his woe    without any cause of further comfort  or further care upon earth      During the following week the earl kept his chamber  and would   admit of no visitor till Mr  Meekly arrived      Mr  Meekly had long estranged himself to Enfield   he had gone   elsewhere  seeking the houses of mourning  and breathing peace   and consolation wherever he went  but  as soon as he heard of   the affliction of his noble friend  he hastened to help him to bear   up under the weight of his calamity  He entered and seated         336 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      himself in silence beside the earl  he there wept near an hour   without uttering a syllable      My lord was the first who spoke Mr  Meekly  said he  my   Heart gratefully feels this melting proof of your love  You weep   for me  my friend  because you see  and kindly feel  that there is   no other comfort for me on this side the grave      God forbid   God forbid   said Mr  Meekly   the best and greatest   of all comforts is coming to you  my lord  Eternal Truth has   promised it  ani he will make it good to you     Blessed  blessed   are they who mourn  for they shall be comforted
