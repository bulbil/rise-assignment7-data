the run away trick  that would render you suspected of turning nose  therefore mum is the word  What say you to it  Are you ready to set off  I am impatient to know your mind   Every one to his own fancy  said I then to Rolando  you were born for bold exploits  and your friend for a serene and quiet life  I understand you  interrupted he  the lady whom love induced you to carry off still preserves her influence over your heart  and you doubtless lead with her that serene life of which you are enamoured  Own the truth  master Gil Blas  she is become a thing of your own  and you are both living on the pistoles carried off from the subterraneous retreat  I told him he was mistaken  and  to set him right  related the lady s adventures and my own while we sat at dinner  When our meal was finished he led back to the subject of the Catalonians  and attempted once more to engage me in his project  But finding me inflexible  he looked at me with a terrific frown  and said seriously    Since you are dastard enough to prefer your servile condition to the honour of enlisting in a troop of brave fellows  I turn you adrift to your own grovelling inclinations  But mark me well  a lapse may be fatal  Forget our meeting of to day  and never prate about me to any living soul  for if I catch you bandying about my name in your idle talk         you know my ways  I need say no more  With these words he called for the landlord  paid the reckoning  and we rose from table to go away       CH  III    Gil Blas is dismissed by Don Bernard de Castil Blazo  and enters into the service of a beau   As we were coming out of the tavern  and taking our leave  my master was passing along the street  He saw me  and I observed him look more than once at the captain  I had no doubt but he was surprised at meeting me in such company  It is certain that Rolando s physiognomy and air were not much in favour of moral qualities  He was a gigantic fellow  with a long face  a parrot s beak  and a very rascally contour  without being absolutely ugly   I was not mistaken in my guess  In the evening I found Don Bernard harping on the captain s figure  and charmingly disposed to believe all the fine things I could have said of him  if my tongue had not been tied  Gil Blas  said he  who is that great shark I saw with you awhile ago  I told him it was an alguazil  and thought to have got off with that answer  but he returned to the charge  and observing my confusion  from the remembrance of the threats used by Rolando  broke off the conversation abruptly and went to bed  The next morning  when I had performed my ordinary duties  he counted me over six ducats instead of six rials  and said    Here  my friend  this is what I give you for your services up to this day  Go and look out for another place  A servant keeping such high company is too much for me  I bethought myself of saying  in my own defence  that I had known that alguazil  by having prescribed for him at Valladolid  while I was practising medicine  Very good  replied my master  the shift is ingenious enough  you might have thought of it last night  and not have looked so foolish  Sir  rejoined I  in good truth prudence kept me silent  and gave to my reserve the aspect of guilt  Undoubtedly  resumed he  tapping me softly on the shoulder  it was carrying prudence very far  even to the confines of cunning  Go  lad  I have no further occasion for your services   I went immediately to acquaint Melendez with the bad news  who told me  for my comfort  that he would engage to procure me a better berth  Indeed  some days after  he said    Gil Blas  my friend  you have no notion of the good luck in store for you  You will have the most agreeable post in the world  I am going to settle you with Don Matthias de Silva  He is a man of the first fashion  one of those young noblemen commonly distinguished by the appellation of beaus  I have the honour of his custom  He takes up goods of me  on tick  indeed  but these great men are good pay in the long run  they often marry rich heiresses  and then old scores are wiped off  or  should that fail  a tradesman who understands his business puts such a price upon his articles  that if three fourths of his debts are bad  he is no loser  Don Matthias s steward is my intimate friend  Let us go and look for him  It will be for him to present you to his master  and you may rely upon it  that for my sake he will treat you with high consideration
