and   fair  In spite of numerous defects as a work of art  The   Fool of Quality is  indeed  a brave book  and an eloquent   book  filled with a noble inspiration that may well kindle   warmer feelings of love and respect for its author than   hundreds of more faultless works will ever attain  On the   other hand  Brooke s editor was just as right in criticising     1 It is only fair to state that Brooke himself was doting at the time    and his nephew practically t  ok the matter into his own hands in   jrantmg the permission  Wesley  also  laid himself open to criticism by   not mentioning the author either on the title page or in his own preface          INTRODUCTION xxix     his incoherence  his exaggeration  and fondness for impro    bability  It is the salient characteristic of the book that   everything is in excess  the hero s perfections most of all    For prigs Brooke had no love   but with the usual ill luck   of those who put ideal heroes on a realistic stage  he does   not always escape the pitfall of making young Harry   Clinton look priggish  The goats are as jet black  and   the lambs as snow white  as in the works of any melo    dramatist of our own sentimental fiction   although in this   particular respect the book is infinitely superior to the   moralistic stories that were in vogue then and later  not   excepting the   improving   fiction of Maria Edgeworth    The Alcides exploits of Harry s boyhood and his deeds   of charity are extravagantly overdone   so are the calamities   of the blameless unfortunates  and the marvellous turns of   fortune by which innocence is at last rewarded  And the   pathos and tears are carried to preposterous lengths  One   feels ofttimes as if the victims of ingenious villainy  by   their unparalleled stupidity  deserved all they got   and that   we should like the hero and his friends a great deal better   if they were a little less demonstrative in their emotions  a   little less effusive in their love of rectitude  But allowance   must be made both for the author s strong and fervent   nature  and for the influence of the school to which as a   novelist he belongs  if he belong to any  Sterne and   Richardson were the powers that reigned supreme over   the fiction written in the third quarter of the eighteenth   century  Mackenzie imitated Sterne  Robert Bage took   Richardson for his master   Mrs  Inchbald  Mrs  Radcliffe    Maria Regina Roche  and a number of writers who are   now almost entirely forgotten  produced novel after novel   in the manner taught in the school of sensibility  There   was  as Kingsley observes about Henry Brooke  and might   have said about a score of other novelists  something rather   French or Irish in this   passionate and tearful sensibility      something utterly opposed to English phlegm  Brooke s   sentimentality  however  is at any rate  not of the morbid   kind  It is the generous excess of the man s temperament    the natural ebullition of feeling  that makes him enter with   the same gusto into the dare devil feats of Ned and Harry s   boyhood  as into the miraculous virtues of their precocious   maturity      There is another point that has not been noticed much   by Brooke s critics  The Fool of Quality was the first or one         xxx INTRODUCTION     of the very first novels containing a rational and sympathetic   study of childhood  It was not till nearly a century later   that a better picture of true boyhood appeared  This must   surely have been one of the attractions that appealed most   strongly to Charles Kingsley  a man so fond of children    and with such an insight into their mind  The chapters on   Harry s infancy and boyhood are surely the tenderest and   the most fascinating in the whole story  In many of the   social and ethical ideas the influence of Rousseau is   probably to be traced  but most of all in those on education    Harry s upbringing by his uncle  the natural mode of   education  which brings out the child s inborn tendencies   and powers  is contrasted with the false and artificial   methods to which  Lord Dickie  falls a victim in the   hands of his unwise parents  But the book is  if not ahead   of its time  at any rate  on the very crest of the wave of pro    gress  in all its ideas  and in its freedom from any sort of cant   or affectation  Why
