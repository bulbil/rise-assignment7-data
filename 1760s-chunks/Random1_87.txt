to be restricted by such a command  and began to manifest itself in    Captain Oakoum  I am a shentleman of birth and parentage  look you  and peradventure  I am moreover—    Here his harrangue was broke off by the captain s steward  who being Morgan s countryman  hurried him out of the cabbin before he had time to exasperate his master to a greater degree  which would certainly have been the case  for the indignant Welchman  could hardly be hindered by his friend s arguments and intreaties  from reentering the presence chamber  and defying captain Oakhum to his teeth —He was  however  appeased at length  and came down to the birth  where finding Thomson and me at work preparing medicines  he bid us leave off our lapour and go to play  for the captain  by his sole word and power and command  had driven sickness a pegging to the tevil  and there was no more malady on poard  So saying  he drank off a gill of brandy  sighed grievously three times  poured forth an ejaculation of   Got pless my heart  liver  and lungs    and then began to sing a Welch song with great earnestness of visage  voice and gesture —I could not conceive the meaning of this singular phaenomenon  and saw by the looks of Thomson  who at the same time  shook his head  that he   248 suspected poor Cadwallader s brains were unsettled  He perceiving our amazement  told us  he would explain the mystery  but at the same time  bid us take notice  that he had lived poy  patchelor  married man and widower  almost forty years  and in all that time  there was no man nor mother s son in the whole world  who durst use him so ill as captain Oakhum had done  Then he acquainted us with the dialogue that passed between them  as I have already related it  and had no sooner finished this narration  than he received a message from the surgeon  to bring the sick list to the quarter deck  for the captain had ordered all the patients thither to be reviewed —This inhuman order shocked us extremely  as we knew it would be impossible to carry some of them on the deck  without imminent danger of their lives  but as we likewise knew it would be to no purpose for us to remonstrate against it  we repaired to the quarter deck in a body  to see this extraordinary muster  Morgan observing by the way  that the captain was going to send to the other world  a great many evidences to testify against himself —When we appeared upon deck  the captain bid the doctor  who stood bowing at his right hand  look at these lazy  lubberly sons of bitches  who were good for nothing on board  but to eat the king s provision  and encourage idleness in the skulkers —The surgeon grinned approbation  and taking the list  began to examine the complaints of each as they could crawl to the place appointed —The first who came under his cognizance  was a poor fellow just freed of a fever  which had weakened him so much  that he could hardly stand —Mr  Mackshane  for that was the doctor s name    249 having felt his pulse  protested he was as well as any man in the world  and the captain delivered him over to the boatswain s mate  with orders that he should receive a round dozen at the gangway immediately  for counterfeiting himself sick when he was not —but before the discipline could be executed  the man dropt down on the deck  and had well nigh perished under the hands of the executioner —The next patient to be considered  laboured under a quartan ague  and being then  in his interval of health  discovered no other symptoms of distemper  than a pale meagre countenance  and emaciated body  upon which  he was declared fit for duty  and turned over to the boatswain —but being resolved to disgrace the doctor  died upon the forecastle next day  during his cold fit —The third complained of a pleuretic stitch  and spitting of blood  for which doctor Mackshane prescribed exercise at the pump to promote expectoration  but whether this was improper for one in his situation  or that it was used to excess  I know not  but in less than half an hour  he was suffocated with a deluge of blood that issued from his lungs —A fourth  with much difficulty climbed to the quarter deck  being loaded with a monstrous ascites or dropsy  that invaded his chest so much  he could scarce fetch his breath  but his disease being interpreted into fat  occasioned by idleness and excess of eating  he was ordered  with a view to promote perspiration and enlarge his chest  to go aloft immediately  It was in vain for this unwieldy wretch  to alledge his utter incapacity  the boatswain s driver was commanded to whip him up with a cat and nine tails  The smart of this application made him exert himself so much  that   250 he actually arrived at the foot hook shrouds  but when the enormous weight of his body had nothing else to support it than his weakened arms  either out of spite or necessity  he quitted his hold
