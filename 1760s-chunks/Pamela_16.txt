this frightful to morrow  how I dread it                LETTER XVI         MY DEAR PARENTS       I know you longed to hear from me soon  and I send you as soon as I   could       Well  you may believe how uneasily I passed the time  till his appointed   hour came  Every minute  as it grew nearer  my terrors increased  and   sometimes I had great courage  and sometimes none at all  and I thought   I should faint when it came to the time my master had dined  I could   neither eat nor drink  for my part  and do what I could  my eyes were   swelled with crying       At last he went up to the closet  which was my good lady s   dressing room  a room I once loved  but then as much hated       Don t your heart ache for me   I am sure mine fluttered about like a   new caught bird in a cage  O Pamela  said I to myself  why art thou so   foolish and fearful  Thou hast done no harm  What  if thou fearest an   unjust judge  when thou art innocent  would st thou do before a just   one  if thou wert guilty  Have courage  Pamela  thou knowest the worst    And how easy a choice poverty and honesty is  rather than plenty and   wickedness       So I cheered myself  but yet my poor heart sunk  and my spirits were   quite broken  Everything that stirred  I thought was to call me to my   account  I dreaded it  and yet I wished it to come       Well  at last he rung the bell  O  thought I  that it was my   passing bell  Mrs  Jervis went up  with a full heart enough  poor good   woman  He said  Where s Pamela  Let her come up  and do you come with   her  She came to me  I was ready to go with my feet  but my heart   was with my dear father and mother  wishing to share your poverty and   happiness  I went up  however       O how can wicked men seem so steady and untouched with such black   hearts  while poor innocents stand like malefactors before them       He looked so stern  that my heart failed me  and I wished myself any   where but there  though I had before been summoning up all my courage    Good Heaven  said I to myself  give me courage to stand before this   naughty master  O soften him  or harden me       Come in  fool  said he  angrily  as soon as he saw me   and snatched my   hand with a pull   you may well be ashamed to see me  after your noise   and nonsense  and exposing me as you have done  I ashamed to see you    thought I  Very pretty indeed   But I said nothing       Mrs  Jervis  said he  here you are both together  Do you sit down  but   let her stand  if she will  Ay  thought I  if I can  for my knees beat   one against the other  Did you not think  when you saw the girl in the   way you found her in  that I had given her the greatest occasion for   complaint  that could possibly be given to a woman  And that I had   actually ruined her  as she calls it  Tell me  could you think any thing   less  Indeed  said she  I feared so at first  Has she told you what I   did to her  and all I did to her  to occasion all this folly  by which   my reputation might have suffered in your opinion  and in that of all   the family   Inform me  what she has told you       She was a little too much frightened  as she owned afterwards  at his   sternness  and said  Indeed she told me you only pulled her on your   knee  and kissed her       Then I plucked up my spirits a little  Only  Mrs  Jervis  said I  and   was not that enough to shew me what I had to fear  When a master of his   honour s degree demeans himself to be so free as that to such a poor   servant as me  what is the next to be expected   But your honour went   farther  so you did  and threatened me what you would do  and talked of   Lucretia
