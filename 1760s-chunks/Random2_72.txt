which she always thought my due  with such advantage of transformation  that unless my image had been engraven on her heart  it would have been impossible to know me for the person who had worn her aunt s livery —that by the language of my eyes  she was assured of the continuance of my passion for her  and consequently of my being unengaged to any other  and that though she did not doubt  I would speedily fall upon some method of being introduced  she was so impatient to hear of me  that she  Miss Williams  had been sent abroad this very morning  on purpose to learn tidings of the name and character I at present bore —My bosom   211 had been hitherto a stranger to such a flood of joy as now rushed upon it  My faculties were overborn by the tide  It was some time  before I could open my mouth  and much longer  ere I could utter a coherent sentence—At length  I servently requested her to lead me immediately to the object of my adoration  but she resisted my importunity  and explained the danger of such premature conduct—   How favourable soever  said she  my lady s inclination towards you may be  this you may depend upon  that she will not commit the smallest trespass on decorum  either in disclosing her own  or in receiving a declaration of your passion  and altho  the great veneration I have for you  has prompted me to reveal what she communicated to me in confidence  I know so well the seveverity of her sentiments with respect to the punctilios of her sex  that  if she should learn the least surmise of it  she would not only dismiss me as a wretch unworthy of her benevolence  but also for ever shun the efforts of your love —  I assented to the justness of her remonstrance  and desired she would assist me with her advice and direction  upon which  it was concerted between us  that for the present  I should be contented with her telling Narcissa that in the course of her inquiries  she could only learn my name  and that if in a day or two  I could fall upon no other method of being made acquainted  she would deliver a letter from me  on pretence of consulting her happiness  and say that I met her in the streets  and bribed her to that piece of service —Matters being thus adjusted  I kept my old acquaintance to breakfast  and learned   212 from her conversation  that my rival Sir Timothy had drunk himself into an apoplexy  of which he died five months ago  that the savage was still unmarried  and that his aunt had been seized with a whim which he little expected  and chosen the school master of the parish for her lord and husband  but matrimony not agreeing with her constitution  she had been hectick and dropsical a good while  and was now at Bath in order to drink the waters for the recovery of her health  that her niece had accompanied her thither at her request  and attended her with the same affection as before  notwithstanding the faux pas she had committed  and that her nephew who had been exasperated at the loss of her fortune  did not give his attendance out of good will  but purely to have an eye on his sister  lest she should likewise throw herself away  without his consent or approbation —Having enjoyed ourselves in this manner  and made an assignation to meet next day at a certain place  Miss Williams took her leave  and Strap s looks being very inquisitive about the nature of the communication subsisting between us  I made him acquainted with the whole affair  to his great astonishment and satisfaction       213  CHAP  LVI    I become acquainted with Narcissa s brother who invites me to his house—where I am introduced to that adorable creature—after dinner  the squire retires to take his nap—Freeman  guessing the situation of my thoughts  withdraws likewise on pretence of business—I declare my passion for Narcissa—am well received—charmed with her conversation—the squire detains us to supper—I elude his design by a stratagem  and get home sober   IN the afternoon  I drank tea at the house of Mr  Freeman  to whom I had been recommended by Banter  where I had not sat five minutes   till the fox hunter came in  and by his familiar behaviour  appeared to be intimate with my friend—I was  at first  under some concern  lest he should recollect my features  but when I found myself introduced to him as a gentleman from London  without being discovered  I blessed the opportunity that brought me into his company  hoping  that in the course of our acquaintance  he would invite me to his house—nor were my hopes frustrated  for as we spent the evening together  he grew extremely fond of my conversation  asked a great many childish questions about France and foreign parts  and   214 seemed so highly entertained with my answers  that in his cups  he shook me often by the hand  pronounced me an honest fellow  and in fine  desired our company at dinner next day  in his own house —My imagination was so much employed in anticipating the happiness I was to enjoy next day  that I slept very
