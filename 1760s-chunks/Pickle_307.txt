  In spite of all the despatch he could make  it was late before he  arrived at the garrison  where he delivered the letter and the lady to  the lieutenant  who no sooner understood the intention of his friend   than he ordered all the tubs in the house to be carried into the hall   and filled with water  Tom having provided himself with swabs and  brushes  divested the fair stranger of her variegated drapery  which  was immediately committed to the flames  and performed upon her soft and  sleek person the ceremony of scrubbing  as it is practised on board of  the king s ships of war  Yet the nymph herself did not submit to this  purification without repining  She cursed the director  who was upon the  spot  with many abusive allusions to his wooden leg  and as for Pipes  the operator  she employed her talons so effectually upon his face  that  the blood ran over his nose in sundry streams  and next morning  when  those rivulets were dry  his countenance resembled the rough bark of a  plum tree  plastered with gum  Nevertheless  he did his duty with great  perseverance  cut off her hair close to the scalp  handled his brushes  with dexterity  applied his swabs of different magnitude and texture  as  the case required  and  lastly  rinsed the whole body with a dozen pails  of cold water  discharged upon her head   These ablutions being executed  he dried her with towels  accommodated  her with a clean shift  and  acting the part of a valet de chambre   clothed her from head to foot  in clean and decent apparel which had  belonged to Mrs  Hatchway  by which means her appearance was altered  so much for the better  that when Peregrine arrived next day  he could  scarce believe his own eyes  He was  for that reason  extremely well  pleased with his purchase  and now resolved to indulge a whim  which  seized him at the very instant of his arrival   He had  as I believe the reader will readily allow  made considerable  progress in the study of character  from the highest rank to the most  humble station of life  and found it diversified in the same manner   through every degree of subordination and precedency  nay  he moreover  observed  that the conversation of those who are dignified with the  appellation of polite company  is neither more edifying nor entertaining  than that which is met with among the lower classes of mankind  and that  the only essential difference  in point of demeanour  is the form of an  education  which the meanest capacity can acquire  without much study or  application  Possessed of this notion  he determined to take the young  mendicant under his own tutorage and instruction  In consequence of  which  he hoped he should  in a few weeks  be able to produce her in  company  as an accomplished young lady of uncommon wit  and an excellent  understanding     6 22 15  3 45 PM   This extravagant plan he forthwith began to execute with great eagerness  and industry  and his endeavours succeeded even beyond his expectation   The obstacle  in surmounting of which he found the greatest difficulty   was an inveterate habit of swearing  which had been indulged from her  infancy  and confirmed by the example of those among whom she had lived   However  she had the rudiments of good sense from nature  which taught  her to listen to wholesome advice  and was so docile as to comprehend  and retain the lessons which her governor recommended to her attention   insomuch  that he ventured  in a few days  to present her at table   among a set of country squires  to whom she was introduced as niece to  the lieutenant  In that capacity she sat with becoming easiness of mien   for she was as void of the mauvaise honte as any duchess in the land   bowed very graciously to the compliments of the gentlemen  and though  she said little or nothing  because she was previously cautioned on that  score  she more than once gave way to laughter  and her mirth happened  to be pretty well timed  In a word  she attracted the applause and  admiration of the guests  who  after she was withdrawn  complimented Mr   Hatchway upon the beauty  breeding  and good humour of his kinswoman   But what contributed more than any other circumstance to her speedy  improvement  was some small insight into the primer  which she had  acquired at a day school  during the life of her father  who was a  day labourer in the country  Upon this foundation did Peregrine build  a most elegant superstructure  he culled out choice sentences from  Shakespeare  Otway  and Pope  and taught her to repeat them with an  emphasis and theatrical cadence  He then instructed her in the names  and epithets of the most celebrated players  which he directed her  to pronounce occasionally  with an air of careless familiarity  and   perceiving that her voice
