as equally prejudicial to my purse and constitution     My next care was to introduce myself into a set of good acquaintance  for which purpose  I frequented a certain coffee house  noted for the resort of good company  English as well as foreigners  where my appearance procured all the civilities and advances I could desire  There being an ordinary in the same house  I went up stairs to dinner with the other guests  and found myself at table with thirteen people  the greatest part of whom were better dressed than myself —The conversation  which was mostly carried on in French  turned chiefly on politicks  and I soon found the whole company was in the French interest  myself excepted  and a testy old gentleman  who contradicted every thing that was advanced in favour of his Most Christian Majesty  with a surliness truly English —But this trusty patriot  who had never been out of his own country  and drew all his maxims and notions from prejudice and hearsay  was very unequal to   86 his antagonists  who were superior to him in learning and experience  and often took the liberty of travellers  in asserting things which were not strictly true  because they thought themselves in no danger of being detected by him —The claim of the queen of Spain to the Austrian dominions in Italy  was fully explained and vindicated  by a person who sat opposite to me  and by the solemnity of his manner  and the richness of his apparel  seemed to be a foreign ambassador —This dissertation introduced another on the Pragmatic Sanction  handled with great warmth by a young gentleman at my right hand  dressed in a green frock trimmed with gold  who justified the French king for his breach of that contract  and affirmed that he could not have observed it  without injuring his own glory —Although I was not at all convinced by this gentleman s arguments  I could not help admiring his vivacity  which I imagined must be the effect of his illustrious birth  and noble education  and accordingly rated him in my conjecture as a young prince on his travels —The discourse was afterwards shifted by an old gentleman of a very martial appearance  to the last campaign  when the battle of Dettingen was fought over again  with so many circumstances to the honour of the French  and disadvantage of the Allies  that I began to entertain some doubts of my having been there in person  and took the liberty to mention some objections to what he advanced —This introduced a dispute which lasted a good while  to the mortification of all present  and was at last referred to the determination of a grave person  whom they stiled doctor  and who under a shew of great moderation  decided it against   87 me  with so little regard to truth  that I taxed him with partiality in pretty severe terms  to the no small entertainment of the true English politician  who rejoiced at my defence of a cause he had so often espoused without success  My oponent pleased with the victory he had gained  affected a great deal of candour  and told me  he would not have been so positive  if he had not been at great pains to inform himself of each particular—   Indeed   said he  I am convinced  that  the previous steps considered  things could not happen otherwise  for we generals who have seen service  tho  we may not be on the spot ourselves  know by the least sketch of the disposition  what must be the event  —  He then censured  with great freedom  every circumstance of the conduct of those who commanded the Allies  from thence made a transition to the Ministry  which he honoured with many invectives  for employing people who had neither experience nor capacity  to the prejudice of old officers who had been distinguished for both  dropt many hints of his own importance  and concluded with observing  that the French and Spaniards knew better how to value generals of merit  the good effects of which are seen in the conquests they gain  and the admirable discipline of their troops  which are at the same time better cloathed and paid than any soldiers in the universe  These remarks furnished the green knight with an opportunity of launching out in the praise of French government in general  civil as well as military  on which occasion he made many odious comparisons to the disadvantage of the English  Every body  almost  assented to the observations he made  and the doctor gave his sanction  by saying  the   88 people in France were undoubtedly the happiest subjects in the world —I was so much astonished and confounded at their infatuation and effrontery  that I had not power to utter one word in opposition to their assertions  but my morose associate could not put up with the indignity that was offered to old England  and therefore with a satirical grin addressed himself to the general in these words    Sir  Sir  I have often heard it said  She s a villainous bird that befouls her own nest —As for what those people who are foreigners say  I don t mind it  they know no better  but you who were bred and born  and have got your bread under the English government  should have more regard to gratitude
