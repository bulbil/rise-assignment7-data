God forgive those people the foul play they made use of  I would not possess a king’s revenue on the terms they now enjoy the Arnold estate  ’Tis whispered  that the widow is supposed to be privately married to this attorney  she owes him a recompence  for I fear he has risqued a great deal to serve her  The wretch had the affrontery to acknowlege his obligation to Mr Arnold  and at the same time declared  that nothing but the justice which he owed the widow  and the orphan of his late friend  could have extorted a testimony from him to his prejudice   I need not tell you in what light my poor Mr Arnold looks upon this affair  He said to a gentleman  from whom Sir George had the account  that he was justly punished for having furnished such a villain with the means of undoing him  and execrates the memory of Mrs Gerrarde  who prevailed on him to do it  for he scarce knew the fellow at that time  having only seen him once or twice at her lodgings  But let me drop the mention of such wretches at once  My heart is full of impatience to hear something from Mr Arnold  Mrs Gerrarde’s letter I fear has had no effect on him  he must have received it long since  What can this dreadful silence mean  My mother now expects the advances towards a reconciliation should be on his side  I would I were rid of my suspence   December 20  Lord and Lady V—— arrived in town last night  They sent a compliment to me as soon as they alighted at their house  which was not till nine o’clock  and this morning at the same hour I was agreeably surprized by a visit from my lord  surprized I say  for he is seldom out of bed so soon  I had him up to my dressing room  my mother had never seen him  and as she was undressed did not chuse to appear  Well  my good lady  said he  after saluting me  have you heard any thing from Mr Arnold lately  I told him I had not  I don’t know whether you are apprized  said he  that I am in all your secrets  Mr Faulkland and I correspond  and I know how all matters stand  You are not made acquainted  perhaps  that I was aiding and abetting to a certain scheme  I told him that Mr Faulkland had writ my brother the whole account  and that I was sure of his kind    participation in every thing that related to me  That you may depend on  said he  the thing cannot be named that I would not do to serve you  I understand from Mr Faulkland  that Mrs Gerrarde has writ to Mr Arnold  have you heard of no effects produced by that letter  I told him  I had never heard a word from Mr Arnold since he had received it  I hope it will not be long before you will  answered he  I called on you this morning on purpose to prepare you  for I suspect Arnold wants to be reconciled  he wrote to me ten days ago  conjuring me in the strongest terms to come to town  and to prevail on lady V—— to accompany me  he said he had something of the utmost consequence to consult us upon  in which our friendship might be of most material advice to him  he concluded with telling me  that the whole happiness of his life depended on our complying with his request  Now as this was immediately on his receiving Mrs Gerrarde’s letter  for I had regular intelligence of the whole proceeding  I flatter myself that it was in consequence of that letter he made this request  with a design  as I hope  of getting us to mediate between you  As I could not just then attend his summons  having business at V—— hall to detain me  I wrote him word  that I should certainly be in town as on this day  and that lady V—— would be sure to accompany me  I have not heard from him since till last night  when I sent a message to his house to desire his company to breakfast with me this morning  I expect him at ten o’clock  Now I had a mind to inform you of this opening  which to me seems to promise very favourably for you  I shall not mention my having seen you  so that I can say nothing from you to him  I asked him  was my lady acquainted with the affair as it really stood  He said she was  for that she had been so exasperated against Mr Faulkland on his first going off with Mrs Gerrarde  whom she thought he had run away with upon a very different design  that he was very glad to undeceive her  and that she would presently have done the same by me  after the letter she had wrote me about that affair  but that he prevented her  thinking Mr Faulkland would be better pleased to unravel the mystery himself  He added  that she was too much my friend  not to enter warmly into my interests  and had been extremely impatient to come to town  I thanked my lord for his and his lady’s friendship  He then asked me how our
