James   My Lord and I were Dear  Love  and Life  all the journey  I was the sweetest tempered creature —Joyful people are not always wise ones  When the heart is open  silly things will be said  any thing  in short  that comes uppermost  I kindly allowed for my Lord s joy  on twenty occasions  I smiled when he smiled  laughed out when he laughed out  did not talk to any body else when he directed his discourse to me  so that the honest man crowed all the way  It is a charming thing  thought I several times  to be on a foot of good understanding with each other  for now I can call him honest man  or any names  that lately would have made him prance and caper  and he takes every thing kindly  Nay  two or three times he called me honest woman  but laughed and looked round him at the time  as if he were conscious that he had made a bold  as well as witty retort   Let me tell you  Lady L  that I intend to give him signs when he exceeds  and other signs when he is right and clever  and I will accept of signs from him  that he may not be affronted  I am confident that we shall be in time an amazing happy couple   Page  70 Emily was rejoiced to see her equally beloved and revered Miss Byron  Miss Byron embraced Emily with the affection of a sister  My honest man kissed Miss Byron s hand on one knee  in the fervour of his love and gratitude  for I had let him know  that he owed much of his present happiness to her  She congratulated him whisperingly  in my hearing  on my being good   James Selby almost wept for love over Emily s hand  while Emily looked as sleek and as shy as a bird new caught  for fear of being thought to give him encouragement  after what you may remember passed between them at Dunstable   Aunt Selby  Lucy  Nancy  were all rapture to see us  We to see them  We were mother and sisters the moment we were seated  Uncle Selby began to crack his jokes upon me in the first half hour  I spared him not  And Lord G  will fare the better for him  since I must have somebody to play the rogue with  Dr  Bartlett was the revered of every heart  By the way  I am in high credit with that good man  for my behaviour to my Lord   Miss Byron received him with open arms  and even  as her father  with an offered cheek  And the modest man was so much affected by her filial regard for him  that I was obliged  for our own sakes  to whisper her  to rein in her joy to see him  that we might have the pleasure of hearing him talk   When we arrived at Selby house  our joy was renewed  as if we had not seen each other at Stratford   O  I should have told you  that in our journey from Stratford hither  aunt Selby  Harriet  Emily  and I  were in one coach  And I had  as we went on  a great deal of good instruction insinuated to me  by way of felicitation  on my being so very kind and obliging to Lord G  And  as if I had been a child  corrected for being untoward  they endeavoured to coax me into a perseverance in what they called my duty  Aunt Page  71 Selby  on this occasion  performed the maternal part with so much good sense  and her praise and her cautions were so delicately insinuated  that I began to think  it was almost as pretty to be good as to be saucy   Upon the whole  I really believe Lord G  will have reason to rejoice  as long as he lives  that he was ruled by his wife  in changing his Windsor and Oxford journey for this of Northamptonshire  So right a thing is it for men to be governable  and  perhaps  you ll add  for women to keep good company   Lord L  thinks you  my sage sister  so good already  that you need not be better  or I would wish him to send you down to Selby house   Well may Harriet revere her grandmother  That venerable woman is good in every sense of the word  She is pious  charitable  benevolent  affectionate  condescending to the very foibles of youth  chearful  wise  patient under the infirmities of age  having outlived all her wishes but one  which is  to see her Harriet happily married  And then  she says  she hopes to be soon released  Never could she be so much admired in her blooming youth  tho  she was then  it seems  deservedly celebrated  both for her mind and person  as she is now in her declining age   You have seen and admire Mrs Selby  She rises upon me every hour  It gives one s heart joy  Lady L  to look forward  beyond the age of youth and flutter  when we see by these Ladies
