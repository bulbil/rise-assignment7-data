by serving myself  I should be obliged to you for permitting him so to do  and to him  for his consent  I would not affront him  by the offer of a salary  My presents to him shall be such as befit the services done —Sometimes as my amanuensis  sometimes as a transcriber and methodizer of Papers and Letters  sometimes in adjusting servants accounts  and fitting them for my inspection  You need not fear my regard to myself in my acknowlegements to be made to him  that  I know  will be all your fear   for I have always considered profusion and parsimony as two extremes  equally to be avoided  You  my dear Dr  Bartlett  have often enforced this lesson on my mind  Can it then ever be forgotten by  Your affectionate Friend and Servant  CHARLES GRANDISON   LETTER II  Signor JERONYMO della PORRETTA  To Sir CHARLES GRANDISON    Bologna  Monday  Sept  15  N  S   YOUR kind Letters from Lyons  my dearest friend  rejoiced us extremely  Clementina languished to hear from you  How was it possible for you to write with so much warmth of affection to her  yet with so much delicacy  that a rival could not take exceptions at it   She writes to you  It is not for me  it is not for   7 any of us  I think  to say one word to the principal subject of her Letter  She shewed it to me  and to her mother  only   Dear creature  Could she be prevailed upon —But how can you be asked to support the family wishes  Yet if you think them just  I know you will  You know not Self  when justice and the service of your friend stand in opposition to it  All that I am afraid of is  that we shall be too precipitate for the dear creature s head   Would to God  you could have been my Brother  That was the first desire of my heart —But you will see by her Letter  the least flighty that she has written of a long time  that she has no thought of that  And she declares to us  that she wishes you happily married to an Englishwoman  Would to Heaven  we might plead your example to her   I will certainly attend you in your England —If one thing  that we all wish  could happen  you would have the whole family  as far as I know  We think  we talk  of nobody but you  We look out for Englishmen  to do them honour for your sake   Mrs  Beaumont is with us  Surely she is your near relation  She advises caution  but thinks that our present measures are not wrong ones  as we never can give into my sister s wishes to quit the world  Dear Grandison  love not Mrs  Beaumont the less for her opinion in our favour   Mr  Lowther writes to you  I say nothing  therefore  of that worthy man   I am wished to write more enforcingly to you  on a certain important subject  But I say  I cannot  dare not  will not   Dear Grandison  love still your Jeronymo  Your friendship makes life worthy of my wish  It has been a consolation to me  when every other failed  and all around me was darkness  and the shadow of death  You will often be troubled with Letters from   8 me  My beloved  my dearest friend  my Grandison  adieu   JERONYMO della PORRETTA   LETTER III  Lady CLEMENTINA  To Sir CHARLES GRANDISON    Bologna  Monday  Sept  15  N  S   HOW welcome to me was your Letter from Lyons  My good Chevalier Grandison  my heart thanks you for it  Yet it was possible that heart could have been still more thankful  had I not observed in your Letter an air of pensiveness  tho  it is endeavoured to be concealed  What pain would it give me to know  that you suffer on my account —But no more in this strain  A complaining one must take place   O Chevalier  I am persecuted  And by whom  By my dearest  my nearest friends  I was afraid it would be so  Why  why  would you deny me your influence  when I importuned you for it  Why would you not stay among us  till you saw me professed  Then had I been happy—In time  I should have been happy —Now am I beset with entreaties  with supplications  from those who ought to command —yet unlawfully  if they did  I presume to think so  Since parents  tho  they ought to be consulted in the change of condition  as to the person  yet surely should not oblige the child to marry  who chooses to be single all her life  A more cogent reason may be pleaded  and I do plead it to my relations  as Catholics  as I wish for nothing so much as to assume the veil —But you are a Protestant  You favour not a Divine dedication  and would not plead for me  On the contrary  you have strengthened their hands —O Chevalier
