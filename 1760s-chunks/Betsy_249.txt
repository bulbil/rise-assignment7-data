no labour  though ever so        hard or abject  too much  if it can enable me to drag on my remains        of life in true penitence            Dear Madam  if  by favouring me with the sum I mention  you are so        good as to open my prison gate  Heaven will  I doubt not  reward        the generous bounty  and  if the Almighty will vouchsafe to hear        the prayers of an abandoned creature like me  I shall never cease        to invoke his choicest blessings may be showered down on the head        of my charming deliverer            I shall send to morrow morning a poor honest woman  whom I can        confide in  for your answer  I beseech you to be assured that  if        once freed from this detested place  no temptations  of what kind        soever  shall ever prevail upon me to return to my yet more        detested former course of life  and am determined to fly to some        remote corner of the kingdom  as distant from London as from L    e         and there endeavour to earn a wretched pittance  by means how low        soever I care not  Your grant of the request I make you at this        time  will save both the soul and body of her who is  with the most        unfeigned contrition  Madam  your most humble  and most unfortunate        servant            A  FORWARD        Utterly impossible was it for this unhappy creature to have sent her   petition at a more unlucky time  Miss Betsy  full of the idea of the   misfortune she had sustained in the loss of Mr  Trueworth  could not be   reminded of Miss Forward  without being also reminded that the first   occasion of his disgust was owing to her acquaintance with that woman        Infamous creature   cried Miss Betsy  as soon as she had done reading     she deserves no compassion from the world  much less from me  No  no    there are but too many objects of charity to be found  and I shall not   lavish the little bounty I am able to bestow  on a wretch like her        These were the first reflections of Miss Betsy on receiving so   unexpected a petition  but they soon subsided  and gave way to others of   a more gentle nature   Yet   said she   if the poor wretch is sensible   of her faults  and truly resolved to do as she pretends  it would be the   utmost cruelty to deny her the means of fulfilling the promise she makes   of amendment        How unhappy is our sex   continued she   either in a too much or too   little sensibility of the tender passion  She was  alas  too easily   influenced by the flatteries of the base part of mankind  and I too   little grateful to the merits of the best        In fine  the natural goodness of her disposition got the ascendant over   all considerations that opposed the grant of Miss Forward s request   My   acquaintance with her has been fatal to me   said she   but that was   less owing to her fault than my own folly        Accordingly  she sent by the woman who came next morning  as mentioned   in the letter  four guineas  inclosed in a piece of paper  and wrote to   her in these terms             To Miss Forward            Madam            Though I cannot but look upon your misfortunes as justly fallen on        you  yet heartily commiserate them  If your penitence is sincere  I        doubt not but you will  some way or other  be enabled to pursue a        more laudable course of life than that which has brought you into        this distress  I add one guinea to the sum you requested  and wish        it were in my power to do more  being your real well wisher  and
