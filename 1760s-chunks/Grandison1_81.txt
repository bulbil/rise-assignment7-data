   I re assured her  I listed her on the seat  and brought her to my sister  And what followed  I suppose  Charlotte  bowing to her  you have told Mr  Reeves      We were both about to break out in grateful applauses  but Sir Charles  as if designing to hinder us  proceeded      You see  Mr  Reeves  what an easy conquest this was  You see what a small degree of merit falls to my share  The violator s conscience was against him  The consciences of his fellows were on my side  My own servants are honest worthy men  They love their master  In a good cause I would set any three of them against six who were engag d in a bad one  Vice is the greatest coward in the world  when it knows it will be resolutely oppos d    198 And what have good men  engaged in a right cause  to fear       What an admirable man is Sir Charles Grandison —Thus thinking  Thus acting   I explained to Sir Charles who this Wilson was  whom the others consulted and were directed by  and what an implement in this black transaction   To what other man s protection in the world  Mr  Selby  could our kinswoman have been obliged  and so little mischief followed   Sir Hargrave  it seems  returned back to town  What a recreant figure  my dear Mr  Selby  must he make  even to himself —A villain   Sir Charles says  that the turnpike men at Smallbury Green told his servants  on their attending him to town after the happy rescue  a formidable story of a robbery committed a little beyond Hounslow by half a dozen villains on horseback  upon a gentleman in a chariot and six  which had passed thro  that turnpike but half an hour before he was a tacked  and that the gentleman  about an hour and half before Sir Charles went thro   returned to town  wounded  for advice  and they heard him groan as he passed through the turnpike   I should add one circumstance  said Sir Charles  Do you know  Charlotte  that you have a rake for your brother —A man on horseback  it seems  came to the turnpike gate  whilst the turnpike men were telling my servants this story  Nothing in the world  said he  but two young rakes in their chariots and six  one robbing the other of a lady  I  and two other passengers  added the man  stood aloof to see the issue of the affair  We expected mischief  And some there was  One of the by standers was the better for the fray  for he took up a silver hilted sword  broken in two pieces  and rode off with it   Sir Hargrave  said Sir Charles  smiling  might well give out that he was robbed  to lose such a prize as Miss Byron  and his sword besides     199 I asked Sir Charles  If it were not advisable to take measures with the villain   He thought it best  he said  to take as little notice of the affair as possible  unless the aggressor stirr d in it  Masquerades  added he  are not creditable places for young ladies to be known to be insulted at them  They are diversions that fall not in with the genius of the English commonalty  Scandal will have something to say from that circumstance  however causeless  But miss Byron s story  told by herself  will enable you to resolve upon your future measures   So  Sir Charles seems not to be a friend to Masquerades   I think  were I to live an hundred years  I never would go to another  Had it not been for Lady Betty—She has  indeed  too gay a turn for a woman of forty  and a mother of children  Miss Byron  I dare say  will be afraid of giving the lead to her for the future  But  excepting my wife and self  nobody in town has suffered more than Lady Betty on this occasion  Indeed she is  I must say  an obliging  wellmeaning woman  And she also declares  so much has she been affected with Miss Byron s danger  of which she takes herself to be the innocent cause  that she will never again go to a Masquerade   I long to have Miss Byron s account of this horrid affair —God grant  that it may not be such a one  as will lay us under a necessity—But as our cousin has a great notion of female delicacy—I know not what I would say—We must have patience a little while longer   Miss Grandison s eyes shone with pleasure all the time her brother was giving his relation   I can only say  my brother  said she  when he had done  that you have rescued an angel of a woman  and you have made me as happy by it  as yourself   I have a generous sister  Mr  Reeves  said Sir Charles   Till I knew my brother  Mr  Reeves  as I now   200 know him  I was
