importance at Rotterdam  in which I could trust   nobody but himself to negociate  and that he would find  in his trunk    letters  and other papers  which would instruct him how to act        In fine   continued the alderman   I went with him aboard  staid with   him till they were ready to weigh anchor  then returned  and stood on   the beach till the ship sailed quite out of sight  so that if my   gentleman had a thought of writing to his mistress  he had not the least   opportunity for it   He added  that he did not altogether deceive his   son  having  indeed  some affairs to transact at Rotterdam  though they   were not of the mighty consequence he had pretended  but which he had    by a private letter to his agent there  ordered should be made appear as   intricate and perplexing as possible  that the young gentleman s return   might be delayed as long as there was any plausible excuse for detaining   him  without his seeing through the reason of it       Mr  Goodman praised the alderman s discretion in the whole conduct of   this business  and  to atone for having been prevailed upon to keep   young Saving s secret from him  offered to make interest with a friend   he had at the post office  to stop any letter that should be directed to   Miss Betsy Thoughtless  by the way of Holland   By which means   said   he   all communication between the young people will soon be put an end   to  he will grow weary of writing letters when he receives no answers    and she of thinking of him as a lover  when she finds he ceases to tell   her he is so        The alderman was ready to hug his old friend for this proposal  which    it is certain  he made in the sincerity of his heart  for they no sooner   parted  then he went to the office  and fulfilled his promise       When he came home  in order to hinder Miss Betsy from expecting to hear   any thing more of Mr  Saving  he told her he had been treated by the   alderman pretty roughly  on account of the encouragement that had been   given in his house to the amorous addresses which had been made to her   by his son   And   added he   the old man is so incensed against him    for having a thought of that kind in your favour  that he has sent him   beyond sea  I know not to what part  but  it seems  he is never to come   back  till he has given full assurance the liking he has for you is   utterly worn off         He might have spared himself the pains   said Miss Betsy  blushing   with disdain   his son could have informed him how little I was   inclinable to listen to any thing he said  on the score of love  and I   myself  if he had asked me the question  would have given him the   strongest assurances that words could form  that if ever I changed my   condition   which Heaven knows I am far from thinking on as yet  I   should never be prevailed upon to do it by any merits his son was   possessed of        Mr  Goodman congratulated her on the indifference she expressed  and   told her  he hoped she would always continue in the same humour  till an   offer which promised more satisfaction in marriage should happen to be   made       Nothing more was said on this head  but Miss Betsy  upon ruminating on   what Mr  Goodman had related  easily imagined  that the day in which he   had been sent away  was the same on which he had appointed to meet her    and therefore excused his not coming as a thing unavoidable  yet  as she   knew not the precaution his father had taken  was not so ready to   forgive him for not sending a line to prevent her waiting so long for   him at the habit shop  She could not  however  when she reflected on the   whole tenor of his deportment to her  think it possible he should all at   once become guilty of wilfully omitting what even common good manners   and decency required  She soon grew weary  however  of troubling herself   about the matter  and a very few days served to make her lose even the   memory of it                CHAPTER VI       May be of some service to the ladies  especially the younger sort  if   well
