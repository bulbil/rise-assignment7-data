by my bedside  I was in the utmost danger  but it pleased God to restore me to the ardent prayers of my dear parent  In about ten days I began to shew some symptoms of amendment  and enquired how Mr Faulkland did  My mother answered  he is well  my dear  and gone out of town  but I believe will return in a day or two  Gone out of town  said I  and leave me dying  Indeed that was not kind of Mr Faulkland  and I shall tell him so  My mother was sitting on the bedside  and had hold of my hand  my brother was standing with his    back to the fire place  I observed they looked at one another  but neither made me any answer  Pray  Sir George  I cried  would you serve the woman so whom you were so near making your wife  My brother was going to reply  but my mother frowned at him  he looked displeased  and went out of the room  Dear madam  said I  there is something the matter with Mr Faulkland  don’t keep me in suspence  I know there is something  which you and my brother would conceal from me  Is Mr Faulkland sick  Not that I know of  I assure you  answered my mother  he was well yesterday  for we had a message from him to enquire after your health  as we have had every day  for he is but at Richmond  and you know if he were in town  he could receive no other satisfaction than hearing from you  as you are too ill to admit of any visits  My mother rang the bell immediately  and asked me to take something  I saw she wanted to turn the conversation  My maid Ellen came into the room  and I asked no more questions   My mother staid with me till it was time for her to go to rest  but avoided mentioning Mr Faulkland’s name  or giving me any opportunity of doing it  for she tenderly conjured me to keep myself quite composed  and not to talk  The doctor assured her this night that he thought me out of danger  and she retired with looks of cordial delight   She was no sooner gone  than I called Ellen to my bedside  and charged her to tell me all she knew concerning Mr Faulkland  The poor girl looked concerned  and seemed to study for an answer  Lord bless me  madam  what should I know of him more than my lady has told you  When did you see him  said I  Not for several days  she answered  Where is he  At Richmond  I heard Sir George say  but I suppose he will come to town as soon as he hears you are well enough to receive him  I catched hold of her hand  ‘Ellen  I know there is something  relative to Mr Faulkland  which you all want to hide from me  don’t attempt to deceive me  you may be sure  whatever it be  I must soon be informed of it  in the mean while  my doubts make me very unhappy ’  The good natured girl’s trouble and confusion increased as I spoke  My dear madam  she replied  when you are better my lady will tell you all  ‘No  no  Ellen  I must know it now  tell it me this minute  or you must never expect to see me better under such uncertainty  What is the all  the frightful all  that I am to be told  How you have shocked me with that little word ’ I know nothing  madam  answered Ellen  but what I gathered from Sir George’s loud angry talk with my lady  and I should be undone if her ladyship were to know I    mentioned it to you  I assured her my mother should not know it  Why then  madam  speaking lower   I am afraid that Mr Faulkland has misbehaved  or has been belied to my lady—She stopped at this—How  how  cried I eagerly  What has she heard of him  Something of another courtship  she replied  but I hope it is all false—You trifle with me—speak out  and say all you know  The poor creature started at my impatience  ‘I know no more  madam  than that I heard my lady say to Sir George  I had rather Sidney were in her grave  than married to him  Sir George said  But why will not you not let Mr Faulkland justify himself  madam  Justify himself  my lady answered  What can he say  Is it not plain that he is false to another woman  They talked lower  but at last Sir George raised his voice  and said  he would give half his estate to have the villain punished—All this  madam  I over heard by mere accident  Sir George was going abroad  his linen was lying ready for him in his dressing room  and his man desired me to put a stitch in one of his master’s point ruffles which was a little ripped in the gathering  I had come up the back stairs into the dressing room  just as my lady  who was with Sir George in the bed
