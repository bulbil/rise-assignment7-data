and were conducted to the tent in the midst of which were placed   bottles  glasses  jellies  sweetmeats  pickles  and I know not what   other things  to regale and quicken the appetite  Servants  who   attended  cooled the glasses out of a silver fountain  on a little   pedestal at one end of the tent  and filled every one a glass with what   each of us chose  One of the company perceiving our conductress was a   French woman  talked to her in her own language  and led her a minuet   around the table  and  in the mean time  the others took the opportunity   of entertaining us  he that had hold of me  so plied me with kisses and   embraces  that I scarce knew where I was  Oh  the differences between   his caresses and the boyish insipid salutes of Master Sparkish  The   others  I suppose  were served with the same agreeable robustness I was    but I had not the power of observing them  any more than  as I   afterwards found  they had of me        In short  never were poor innocent girls so pressed  so kissed  every   thing but the dernier undoing deed  and that there was no opportunity of   compleating  every one of us  our tutoress not excepted  I am certain   experienced         Heavens   cried Miss Betsy  interrupting her   how I envied your   happiness a moment since  and how I tremble for you now         O Miss Betsy   replied Miss Forward   every thing would have been done   in that forgetful hour  but  as I have already said  there was not an   opportunity  My lover  notwithstanding   for so I must call him  would   not let me get out of his arms  till I had told him my name  and by what   means he should convey a letter to me  I affected to make a scruple of   granting this request  though  Heaven knows  I was but too well pleased   at his grasping me still faster  in order to compel me to it  I then   gave him my name  and told him  that if he would needs write  I knew no   other way by which he might be sure of my receiving his letter  but by   slipping it into my hand as I was coming out of church  which he might   easily do  there being always a great concourse of people about the   door  on this he gave me a salute  the warmth of which I never shall   forget  and then suffered me to depart with my companions  who  if they   were not quite so much engaged as myself  had yet enough to make them   remember this night s ramble        The tutoress knew well enough how to excuse our staying out so much   longer than usual  and neither the governess  nor any one in the   family  except ourselves  knew any thing of what had passed  I cannot   say but my head ran extremely on this adventure  I heartily wished my   pretty fellow might keep his word in writing to me  and was forming a   thousand projects how to keep up a correspondence with him  I don t tell   you I was what they call in love  but certainly I was very near it  and   longed much more for Sunday than ever I had done for a new gown  At   last  the wished for day arrived  my gentleman was punctual  he came   close to me in the church porch  I held my hand in a careless manner    with my handkerchief in it behind me  and presently found something put   into it  which I hastily conveyed into my pocket  and  on coming home    found a little three cornered billet  containing these lines             To the charming Miss Forward            Most lovely of your sex            I have not slept since I saw you  so deep an impression has your        beauty made on my heart  that I find I cannot live without you  nor        even die in peace if you vouchsafe not my last breath to issue at        your feet  In pity  then  to the sufferings you occasion  grant me        a second interview  though it be only to kill me with your frowns         I am too much a stranger in these parts to contrive the means  be         therefore  so divinely good to do it for
