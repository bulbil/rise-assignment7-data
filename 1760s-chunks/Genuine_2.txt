in high repute among those of the same trade  and her shop was more frequented by the bucks of the town than any other in that neighbourhood  She rejoiced at having met with so divine a creature as Miss ELLIOT  and she resolved to make a great advantage of her  She told her the way of life she was engaged in  and finding that her pupil s inclination for the same calling perfectly coincided with her views  she bid her be of good heart  for that she was born to great fortune  and advised her withal inviolably to observe what she was going to say to her  which   6 the other  with repeated assurances  told her she would not fail to perform   My dear  said she  you are very young  and consequently have not been able to form such essential plans as one of riper years  more experience  and greater opportunities  You are now entered on a soone of life  perhaps the most difficult to prosecute with success  Censummate prudence  and the most heroic fortitude  are absolutely requisite to guide you through the thorny path that lies before you  Though you have beauty  breeding  and other accomplishments of a woman  these will avail you nothing  if you do not employ them as your main artillery in the conquest of men  whose passions  follies  and caprices  you must constantly study  as the principal springs by which you are to lead them at will   The generality of men have many humours to be gratified  besides their amorous desires  Where vanity prevails  reserve must be used  and pretence to a consinement of your favour   7 to a select number of men  and that upon a very perfect acquaintance only  by which you insinuate  that your company intitles you to a very genteel present  If you indulge a man with the enjoyment of your person at the first interview  you derogate from your consequcnce  and can expect but a tristing gratuity  for a woman s importance and difficulty of access ever decide her value  Remember  that while a silly girl  who is lavish of her favours  rots in an hospital  the artful reserved courtezan lives in pomp and splendor   The first maxim on entering this way of life  is to declare perpetual war against the male sex in general  to love none  but secretly contemn  and artfully fleece them all   This  my dear  is not the effect of revenge  but the dictates of self love and female prudence  If either sex were to decide my hatred in proportion to their ill treatment  I should most detest my own  for to a woman  even   8 that woman my mother  do I owe the cause of my prostitution   My father  who was a farmer  dying when I was young  my mother  whom her husband s death had involved in great difficulties  had much ado to support me  As I grew up  I was taught the use of the needle  but I was far from having any inclination to such an employment  I did not reflect on the solid reason my mother had for inuring me thus early to work  as I had no other provision than what I earned by my fingers  I continued living in this manner  till I was fourteen years old  the fatal aera of all my misfortunes  About this time my mother was hard pressed by our landlord for two years rent  for which  as she could not pay  he threatened a seizure  my mother took an opportunity to tell me  I had made my fortune  if I would act according to her dictates  for Mr  L— the landlord  had actually desired me in marriage  I was charmed with the prospect of being a gentlewoman  and promised to obey her  He accordingly   9 visited us once or twice a week  and was frequently left alone with me   The day of sacrifice now approached  and my suitor came at the usual hour  My mother told me to dress myself  for she intended to pay a visit with me that evening in company with Mr  L—  Little suspecting the accursed design of my infamous parent  I went into my bed chamber  and had no sooner taken off my stays to change them for a better pair  than the landlord bounced into my room embraced me  and told me  he supposed I was acquainted with the subject of his visit  I answered only with a blush  he proceeded to indecent behaviour  upon which I loudly exclaimed against his damnable purpose on my irretrievable ruin   My pious mother came  but not to my relief  for the monster insisted on my compliance  instead of endeavouring to rescue me from infamy  from prostitution  absolute force compelled me to submit  and I was thus cruelly sacrificed to the brutal lust of her vile landlord     10But as base designs are often rendered abortive  the sacrifice of her daughter s virtue exempted her not from the demand of the ungenerous  faithless  L—  for though he promised that the grant of a favour from me should acquit her in his accounts  yet as she had taken no receipt for the rent  when she detestably thought to barter my virtue
