this paragon of the buttery  I was just going to withdraw in the full determination of not coming again  when assuming all at once an open and smiling aspect  he said with considerable earnestness  Ah  Signor Gil Blas de Santillane  pray forgive the formality of your welcome  My memory ill seconded the warmth of my disposition towards you  Your name had escaped me  and was not at the moment identified with the gentleman  of whom mention was made in a letter from Grenada more than four months ago   How happy I am to see you  added he  shaking hands with me most cordially  My uncle Melchior  whom I love and honour like my natural father  charges me  if by chance I should have the honour of seeing you  to entertain you as his own son  and in case of need  to stretch my own credit and that of my friends to the utmost in your behalf  He extols the qualities of your heart and mind in terms sufficient of themselves to engage me in your service  though his recommendation had not been added to the other motives  Consider me  therefore  I entreat you  as participating in all my uncle s sentiments  You may depend on my friendship  let me hope for an equal share in yours   I replied to Joseph s polite assurances in suitable terms of acknowledgment  so that being both of us warm headed and sincere  a close intimacy sprung up without waiting for common forms  I felt no embarassment about laying open the state of my affairs  This I had no sooner done  than he said  I take upon myself the care of finding you a situation  meanwhile  there is a knife and fork for you here every day  You will live rather better than at an ordinary  This offer was sure to be well relished by an invalid just recovering with a fastidious palate and an empty pocket  It could not but be accepted  and I picked up my crumbs so fast that at the end of a fortnight I began to look like a rosy gilled son of the church  It struck me that Melchior s nephew larded his lean sides to some purpose  But how could it be otherwise  he had three strings to his bow  as holding the undermentioned pluralities  the butler s place  the clerkship of the kitchen  and the stewardship  Furthermore  without meaning to question my friend s honesty  they do say that the comptroller of the household and he looked over each other s hands   My recovery was entirely confirmed  when my friend Joseph  on my coming in to dinner as usual one day  said with an air of congratulation  Signor Gil Blas  I have a very tolerable situation in view for you  You must know that the Duke of Lerma  first minister of the crown in Spain  giving himself up entirely to state affairs  throws the burden of his own on two confidential persons  Don Diego de Monteser takes the charge of collecting his rents  and Don Rodrigo de Calderona superintends the finances of his household  These two officers are paramount in their departments  having nothing to do with one another  Don Diego has generally two deputies to transact the business  and finding just now that one of them had been discharged  I have been canvassing for you  Signor Monteser having the greatest possible regard for me  granted my request at once  on the strength of my testimony to your morals and capacity  We will pay our respects to him after dinner   We did not miss our appointment  I was received with every mark of favour  and promoted in the room of the dismissed deputy  My business consisted in visiting the farms  in giving orders for the necessary repairs  in dunning the farmers  and keeping them to time in their payments  in a word  the tenants were all under my thumb  and Don Diego checked my accounts every month with a minuteness which few receivers could have borne  But this was exactly what I wanted  Though my uprightness had been so ill requited by my late master  it was my only inheritance  and I was determined not to sell the reversion   One day news came that the castle of Lerma had taken fire  and was more than half burnt down  I immediately went thither to estimate the loss  In forming myself to a nicety  and on the spot  respecting all the particulars of the unlucky accident  I drew up a detailed narrative  which Monteser shewed to the Duke of Lerma  That minister  though vexed at the circumstance  was struck with the memorial  and inquired who was the author  Don Diego thought it not enough to answer the question  but spoke of me in such high terms  that his excellency recollected it six months afterwards  on occasion of an incident I shall now relate  had it not been for which I might never  perhaps  have been employed at court  It was as follows      There lived at that time in Princes Street an elderly lady  by name In√©silla de Cantarilla  Her birth was a matter of mystery  Some said she was the daughter of a musical instrument maker  and others gave her a high military extraction  However that might be
