were but too well founded  We have had a letter from her son’s agent  The debt must be paid  and we are come to a resolution to sell two hundred and fifty pounds a year  We shall then have but fifty pounds a year in the world which we can call our own  I reckon not upon my mother’s life  these afflictions I fear will hasten her departure to another world  From Sir George we have nothing to expect  he is absorbed in vanity  his new alliances engross him intirely   My dear lady V—— writes us word  she will do her utmost to promote Mr Arnold’s interest  She has numerous and powerful friends  and says  she makes no doubt of obtaining something for him worth his acceptance  Believe me  my Cecilia  I am not disheartened at this fresh blow  If my dear Mr Arnold could reconcile himself to it  I could be well contented  I will not now  though you used to accuse me of it  anticipate misfortunes  we have still enough for the present to live on decently  and if my lady V——’s kind endeavours should succeed  we may yet be happily provided for  I will not let the thought of my mother’s death interfere  let me but calm the anxious fears of my poor Mr Arnold  and all will be well   May 12  Thank God we have done with the merciless lord V——  his money is to be paid directly to him  I have recovered my tranquility  I enjoy my little in peace  and have the comfort to see Mr Arnold’s mind more at ease  and reconciled to his lot  To lady V—’s goodness  as well as my own earnest endeavours  I impute this  She says  she has the promise of an honourable and a profitable post for him  but we are to wait some months for it  The person who is now in possession of this place is to be preferred to a better  and she says  she has the word of an honest man on the occasion  ‘he is a very great man too  says my lady in her letter  but as it is on the first part of his character chiefly we    are to depend  I mention the other only by the by ’  Now  my dear  have I not reason to be contented  A thankless heart should I have if I were not  but I am  indeed  my Cecilia  I am  and I begin again to be happy  Our domestick felicity was but disturbed for a while  it was not over thrown   Here will I close  I have an opportunity of sending this immediately by a private hand to my beloved    Here Mrs Arnold’s maid Patty continues the journal    May 15  By my lady’s orders I take up the pen  and she has charged me to set down every particular  God knows I am ill able to do it  but I will strive to obey her  My poor dear lady is in such trouble  she has not the heart to write  nor scarcely to do any thing   My master—Oh  madam  how shall I express myself  my poor master  now he is so good  we are going  I fear  to lose him  I must write  according to my lady’s custom  every thing in the best order I can   You cannot think  madam  how happy they have lived together ever since my lady came home to him again  He seemed to grow fonder and fonder of her every day  I believe he perfectly adored her  and he had reason   You know  madam  my lady was always used to a chariot  but they never attempted keeping one since they came down to Sidney castle  She asked my master once  if he had a horse quiet enough for her to venture to ride on to church  I observed my master turned away his face  and put his handkerchief to his eyes  I believe he thought of a little favourite pad that he had given to Mrs Gerrarde  I have not one  my love  said he  that I would trust you on  You had once a pretty horse that you were fond of  but my desperate folly has not even left you that  but I will look out for one that will suit you  No matter  my dear  said my lady smiling  and taking him by the hand  I will ride double  I think that will suit me best  Dearest of women  said my master  and he fetched a deep sigh   when shall I be able to make you amends  He lamented hourly the loss of his fortune for her sake  What will become of you  my dearest creature  and my two poor children  said he  when he was obliged to part with her jointure   if I should die before you  and then he cried  and wrung his hands  My lady begged of him to put such melancholy thoughts out of his head     saying  they never disturbed her  I hope  said she  I shall never see your death  but if it pleases God to punish me so far  a little
