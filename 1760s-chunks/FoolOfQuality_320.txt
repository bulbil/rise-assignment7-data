it  I must obey your summons  though very reluctantly  I confess    Then  sir  said I  meet me in half an hour  with your pistols and   sword  behind yonder hill      The colonel was punctual to the appointment  We both grasped   a pistol at the distance of twenty paces  and advancing step by   step  cried Fire   Fire   Each seemed determined to make sure   of his adversary  till  coming within arm s length  I fired directly   in his face  but the ball passed through his hat  and only grazed   the skin of his left temple      The colonel then took his pistol into his left hand  and reaching   out his right to me  with a smile of great complacence I think    sir  said he  I may now ask your pardon with honour  and to   convince you that I did not come to engage you in malice  be   pleased to examine my arms  you will not find so much as a grain   of powder in the one or the other      Ah  colonel   I then exclaimed  I acknowledge you my conqueror   both in honour and humanity  Had I been so unhappy as to   kill you  and find your arms unloaded  I should certainly have   done you justice by shooting myself through the head  But why   did I pursue you from kingdom to kingdom  why was I unappeased   by all the blood that I shed   Was it from any malignity of heart   toward you   By no means  But while I lamented the misery   I had already occasioned you  I was impelled to finish your   destruction by a barbarian world  or rather  by the bloody pre    scribers of custom  whose censure I dreaded worse than death  or   even futurity  Courage  colonel  incites soldiers to fight for their   country   but it is cowardice alone that drives duellists together          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  351     For three affectionate days I remained with my late enemy    but now warm friend  He then was obliged to return to quarters     and we parted with a regret much exceeding the hostility with   which we had met      On the departure of the colonel I went to Amsterdam  from   whence I drew upon my uncle to the amount of 700  For I re    solved  before my return  to take a tour through the seven provinces    though I had gone for a very different purpose      During nine months I resided  or journeyed from place to place    among that people  Holland is  unquestionably  the wealthiest    the busiest  and most populous state upon earth  Not a hand is   unemployed  not a foot of ground unoccupied  and  for a long   time  I ascribed their extraordinary prosperity to an industry   and ingenuity peculiar to them alone  But  on further observation    I discovered the true source as well of their industry as their   opulence  and am persuaded that any nation bordering on the ocean   might derive the like prosperity from the same spring      Not  my lord  that I think opulence a real benefit to a people    for   man s life consisteth not in the abundance of his possessions     But I look upon industry  the natural parent of opulence  to be as   well a blessing as a duty to man  from the time that he was   appointed to  earn his bread in the sweat of his brow   Many   mental virtues also  as well as temporal benefits  follow in the   train of industry  it makes men healthful  brave  honest  social    and pacific  He who labours hard to acquire a property  will   struggle hard to preserve it  and exercise will make him active    robust  and able for the purpose  As the man of industry hath    in himself  a living fund of competence for his own occasions  he   will be the less tempted to plunder or prey upon others  and   the poignant sense and apprehension of being deprived of a   property so justly acquired  will give him the nicer and stronger   sense of such an injury to others  Industry further incites to com    merce and good neighbourhood  in order to dispose of mutual   redundancies for the supply of mutual wants  And lastly  it   delighteth in peace  that its time and its labours may not be inter    rupted  nor the fruits thereof endangered  by rapine and invasion     and all this may be said of nations as well as of men      Your observations  said the
