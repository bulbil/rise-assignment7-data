attended him in person with the most affectionate  care  during the whole fit  which lasted a fortnight  and then retired  before the strength of his constitution   When the old gentleman recovered his health  he was so penetrated with  Peregrine s behaviour  that he actually would have made over to him his  whole fortune  and depended upon him for his own subsistence  had not  our youth opposed the execution of the deed with all his influence  and might  and even persuaded him to make a will  in which his friend  Hatchway  and all his other adherents  were liberally remembered   and his aunt provided for on her own terms  This material point being  settled  he  with his uncle s permission  departed for London  after  having seen the family affairs established under the direction and  administration of Mr  Jolter and the lieutenant  for  by this time  Mrs   Trunnion was wholly occupied with her spiritual concern   On his first arrival at London  he sent a card to the lodgings of  Gauntlet  in consequence of a direction from his mother  and that young  gentleman waited on him next morning  though not with that alacrity of  countenance and warmth of friendship which might have been expected  from the intimacy of their former connection  Nor was Peregrine himself  actuated by the same unreserved affection for the soldier which he had  formerly entertained  Godfrey  over and above the offence he had taken  at Pickle s omission in point of corresponding with him  had been  informed  by a letter from his mother  of the youth s cavalier behaviour  to Emilia  during his last residence at Winchester  and our young  gentleman  as we have already observed  was disgusted at the supposed  discovery which the soldier had made in his absence to the commodore   They  perceived their mutual umbrage at meeting  and received each other  with that civility of reserve which commonly happens between two persons  whose friendship is in the wane   Gauntlet at once divined the cause of the other s displeasure  and  in  order to vindicate his own character  after the first compliments were  passed  took the opportunity  on inquiring after the health of the  commodore  to tell Peregrine  that  while he tarried at the garrison   on his return from Dover  the subject of the conversation  one night   happening to turn on our hero s passion  the old gentleman had expressed  his concern about that affair  and  among other observations  said   he supposed the object of his love was some paltry hussy  whom he had  picked up when he was a boy at school  Upon which  Mr  Hatchway assured  him  that she was a young woman of as good a family as any in the  county  and  after having prepossessed him in her favour  ventured   out of the zeal of his friendship  to tell who she was  Wherefore  the  discovery was not to be imputed to any other cause  and he hoped Mr   Pickle would acquit him of all share in the transaction   Peregrine was very well pleased to be thus undeceived  his countenance  immediately cleared up  the formality of his behaviour relaxed into  his usual familiarity  he asked pardon for his unmannerly neglect of  Godfrey s letter  which he protested  was not owing to any disregard   or abatement of friendship  but to a hurry of youthful engagements  in  consequence of which he had procrastinated his answer from time to time   until he was ready to return in person     6 22 15  3 45 PM   The young soldier was contented with this apology and  as Pickle s  intention  with respect to his sister  was still dubious and undeclared   he did not think it was incumbent upon him  as yet  to express any  resentment on that score  but was wise enough to foresee  that the  renewal of his intimacy with our young gentleman might be the means of  reviving that flame which had been dissipated by a variety of new  ideas  With those sentiments  he laid aside all reserve  and their  communication resumed its former channel  Peregrine made him acquainted  with all the adventures in which he had been engaged since their  parting  and he  with the same confidence  related the remarkable  incidents of his own fate  among other things  giving him to understand   that  upon obtaining a commission in the army  the father of his dear  Sophy  without once inquiring about the occasion of his promotion  had  not only favoured him with his countenance in a much greater degree than  heretofore  but also contributed his interest  and even promised the  assistance of his purse  in procuring for him a lieutenancy  which he  was then soliciting with all his power  whereas  if he had not been  enabled  by a most accidental piece of good fortune  to lift himself  into the sphere of an officer  he had all the reason in the world to  believe that this gentleman  and all the
