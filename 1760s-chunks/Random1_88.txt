 and plumped into the sea  where he must have been drowned  had not a sailor who was in a boat along side  saved his life  by keeping him afloat  till he was hoisted on board by a tackle—It would be tedious and disagreeable to describe the fate of every miserable object that suffered by the inhumanity and ignorance of the captain and surgeon  who so wantonly sacrificed the lives of their fellow creatures  Many were brought up in the height of fevers  and rendered delirious by the injuries they suffered in the way —Some gave up the ghost in the presence of their inspectors  and others  who were ordered to their duty  languished a few days at work  among their fellows  and then departed without any ceremony —On the whole  the number of sick was reduced to less than a dozen  and the authors of this reduction were applauding themselves for the service they had done to their king and country  when the boatswain s mate informed his honour  that there was a man below lashed to his hammock by the direction of the doctor s mate  and that he begged hard to be released  affirming  he had been so maltreated only for a grudge Mr  Morgan bore to him  and that he was as much in his senses as any man aboard —The captain hearing this  darted a severe look at the Welchman  and ordered the man to be brought up immediately  Upon which  Morgan protested with great fervency  that the person in question was as mad as a March hare  and begged for the the love of Got  they would at least keep his   251 arms pinioned during his examination  to prevent him from doing mischief —This request the commander granted for his own sake  and the patient was produced  who insisted upon his being in his right wits with such calmness and strength of argument  that every body present was inclined to believe him  except Morgan  who affirmed there was no trusting to appearances  for he himself had been so much imposed upon by his behaviour two days before  that he had actually unbound him with his own hands  and had well nigh been murdered for his pains  this was confirmed by the evidence of one of the waiters  who declared  he had pulled this patient from the doctor s mate  whom he had gotten down and almost strangled —To this the man answered  that the witness was a creature of Morgan s  and was suborned to give his testimony against him by the malice of the mate  whom the defendant had affronted  by discovering to the people on board  that Mr  Morgan s wife kept a gin shop in Rag Fair —This anecdote produced a laugh at the expence of the Welchman  who shaking his head with some emotion  said    Ay  ay   tis no matter —Got knows   tis an arrant falshood  —  Captain Oakhum  without any further hesitation  ordered the fellow to be unfettered  at the same time  threatening to make Morgan exchange situations with him for his spite  but the Briton no sooner heard the decision in favour of the madman  than he got up the mizzen shrouds  crying to Thomson and me to get out of his reach  for we should see him play the tevil with a vengeance  We did not think fit to disregard this caution  and accordingly got up on the poop  whence we beheld the maniac  as soon as he was released  fly at the   252 captain like a fury  crying    I ll let you know  you scoundrel  that I am commander of this vessel —  and pummel him without mercy  The surgeon  who went to the assistance of his patron  shared the same fate  and it was with the utmost difficulty  that he was mastered at last  after having done great execution among those who opposed him     CHAP  XXVIII   The captain enraged  threatens to put the madman to death with his own hand—is diverted from that resolution by the arguments and persuasion of the first lieutenant and surgeon—we set sail for St  Helens  join the fleet under the command of Sir C—n—r O—le  and proceed for the West Indies—are overtaken by a terrible tempest—my friend Jack Rattlin has his leg broke by a fall from the main yard—the behaviour of doctor Mackshane—Jack opposes the amputation of his limb  in which he is seconded by Morgan and me  who undertake the cure  and perform it successfully   THE captain was carried into his cabbin  so enraged with the treatment he had received  that he ordered the sellow to be brought before him  that he might have the pleasure of pistoling him with his own hand  and would certainly   253 have satisfied his revenge in this manner  had not the first lieutenant remonstrated against it  by observing that in all appearance  the fellow was not mad but desperate  that he had been hired by some enemy of the captain to assassinate him  and therefore ought to be kept in irons till he could be brought to a court martial  which  no doubt  would sift the affair to the bottom  by which  important discoveries might be made  and then sentence the criminal to a death adequate to his demerits —This suggestion
