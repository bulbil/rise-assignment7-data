might have been listened to on this subject not without uneasiness  though my duty to her would not suffer me to give her a moment’s pain  unless I was sure that my eternal as well as temporal happiness was at stake  I told Mrs Vere that I had no aversion to Mr Arnold  on the contrary that if I had a sister  I should wish her married to him  Now  my Cecilia  the mischief of it is  there can be no reasonable objection made to him  he is a very tolerable man  but I knew a man once that I liked better—but fye fye upon him  I am sure I ought not to like him  and therefore I will not  I am positive  if I were let alone  I should be as happy as ever   I told you I got a letter from my brother  he says in it  he has had one from Mr Faulkland  who is now in your part of the world  He tells Sir George  that ‘if my lady Bidulph will be so good as to see Miss B  and converse with her  he is not without hopes that she may so far exculpate him  as to induce my lady to repeal his sentence of banishment ’ Sir George adds his own wishes for this  but says  to give you his words  he fears the wench will not be honest enough to do Faulkland justice—Justice  what can my brother mean by this     How ungenerous these men are  even the best of them  in love matters  He knows the poor girl doats on her destroyer  and might perhaps take shame to herself  rather than throw as much blame on him as he deserves  I think this is all the justice that can be expected from her  and how poor an extenuation would this make of his guilt  It would only add to the merit of her sufferings  without lessening his fault   To what purpose then would it be  I know my mother’s sentiments already on that head  I would not shew Sir George’s letter to her  he had said so many ridiculous things about lady Grimston in it  which I know would have offended her highly  otherwise  on account of Mr Faulkland’s paragraph  I should have been glad she had seen it   September 12  Ah  my sister  my friend  What shall I do  Oh  that officious lady Grimston—What ill star drove me to her house  Nothing would serve her but she must know what Mr Arnold said to me in the drawing room conference  and how I had behaved  She made her enquiry before my mother and the dean  after I had left them in the garden  What could the man do  He had no reason to conceal what passed  and frankly owned he had made me an offer of his heart  Well  and how did Miss receive it  asked lady Grimston  With that modesty and polite sweetness that she does every thing  answered Mr Arnold  He could say no less  you know   He thence took occasion to apply particularly to my mother  apologizing at the same time for his not having done it before  What the self sufficient creature added  I know not  for my mother  from whom I had this account  did not repeat all he said  but it seems it was enough to make her imagine I had not heard him reluctantly  and accordingly she gave him her permission to win me and wear me   I could cry for very vexation  to be made such a puppet of  This eclaircissement I dreaded before I had time to explain myself to my mother  That best of women  still anticipating what I had to say  congratulated me on my extraordinary prudence  in not letting a childish misplaced attachment keep such a hold on my heart  as to make me blind to the merits of a more deserving object   Dear madam  said I  sure Mr Arnold did not say that I had encouraged his addresses  Encouraged  my dear  why sure the hearing  from a young lady of your education  is encouragement enough to a man of sense —I heard him with complaisance  madam     because I thought that due to him  that it was my wish to remain single  at least for some time  My mother looked surprized  ‘Sidney  this is not what I expected from you  I flattered myself you thought no longer of Mr Faulkland ’  She contracted her brow a little  Madam  I do not  indeed I think no more of him  but may I not be permitted to continue as I am   Had you never had any engagement with Mr Faulkland  answered my mother  I should be far from urging you on this occasion  but  circumstanced as you now  are  I think your honour is concerned   Lady Grimston has put your affair in such a light to me  as I never considered it in before  How mortifying must the reflection be  my dear  to think that it may be said Mr Faulkland perhaps flew off  from some disadvantageous circumstance he discovered in regard to you  The world wants not envious malicious tongues enough to give it this turn  Your
