preserver   I cried   I owe you   more than life  Existence had been my greatest of curses without   you  That I am not  at this moment  the deepest damned of the   creation   that I find myself the most blessed of all beings   to   you alone it is owing  my Longfield  my deliverer  Nay  hope   not to escape me   we never more must part  You are my captive   for life  And I  and all that I am  or have  is yours to eternity      As the people within and without were still in great commotion    the court appeared much alarmed   and the judge and most of   the gentry made homeward  through a private door that opened   into a back alley  But their fears were groundless   for the crowd   was wholly intent on another object  and impatiently waited for a   sight of my Arabella      As she walked forward  attended by Mr  Longfield and myself    they made way for her on either hand  and the atmosphere again   rung with shouts and acclamations  So sincere is the respect that   the populace pay to virtue   and such is their exultation when   innocence rises superior to oppression   But when innocence and   virtue are accompanied by beauty  their reverence grows almost   criminal and approaches to adoration      Thus we returned to Newgate  amidst the blessings  prayers    and praises of a yielding multitude  who still respectfully opened   as Arabella advanced  The windows on all sides poured forth   congratulations   and those through whom we had passed pressed   forward for another sight  as though their eyes could not be   satisfied with beholding      Before we entered her late prison  my wife turned about and   curtsied three or four times to her numerous attendants  with an   acknowledging grace and humility that seemed oppressed by their   favours  She then entered hastily  and running tip stairs  she   caught her child from the nurse keeper  She held him some time   in her arms   her bosom gently heaved   and the tears rolled in   silence down her placid countenance  But on our approach  she   turned suddenly into the bed chamber  shut to the door  and con    tinued there in private for near an hour          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  109     In the mean time I sent out for a warm dinner and a bottle of   wine  Mr  Longfield now told me that he had often been tempted   to introduce himself to us during my wife s confinement  but   he feared that the discovery of any acquaintance or correspondence   between us might prejudice Arabella upon her trial  and that    therefore  he had made use of the little stratagem of the verses    which he had thrust under our door  in order to preserve us from a   total depression of spirits      When the cloth was laid  I whispered gently through the key    hole to my Arabella   and soon after she came forth  with a har    mony and beatitude of motion and aspect  as though she had   instantly dropped from that heaven which had wholly possessed   her during her absence      At table  Mr  Longfield gave us some heads of his history  He   further told us  that since the death of his late lord he had en    tered into another sendee   but that he had been out of place for   about a month past      After some further discourse  I called up the keeper  discharged   the reckoning and fees  and returned thanks for his civility to my   Arabella  I then sent for a coach  and we drove home together      Mrs  Jennett received us with warm congratulations   we imme    diately invited her to a dish of tea  over which she agreed with   our friend for the streeirroom on the same floor at three shillings   per week  Arabella was now at liberty to revisit her old acquaint    ance  She was more caressed than ever  and took in so much work   that she was obliged to hire a girl to attend to the child      I was now at the very pinnacle of human happiness  Affliction   was no more  The remembrance of distress and poverty had   vanished as a dream  Our days moved up and down  and joy and   peace nightly prepared our pillows      Mr  Longfield was very lovely in his person and manners   We   had contracted a friendship which I imagined too strict for time to   untie   and I loved him the better for his
