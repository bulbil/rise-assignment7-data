you to suspend your visit till the afternoon  She was not  she said  prepared to see you —I asked her  continued she  What preparation was wanted to see a man esteemed by us all  and who had given such instances of his regard to her   Madam  answered she  and seemed as if gasping for breath  Am I not now to see him in a light  in which hitherto I never beheld him  I have a thousand things to say to him  none of which perhaps I shall be able to say  except he draws them from me  He hinted once  very lately  that he could only be rewarded by a family act  We cannot reward him  that is my grief  I must see him with a heart overwhelmed with obligation  He will appear as a prince to me  I must to myself as his vassal  I have been putting down  in writing  what I should say to him  but I cannot please myself  O madam  he is great in my eyes  because I am unable to reward him as he deserves  I told her  that her fortune  her quality  the sacrifice she would make of her Country  tho  never  I hoped  of her Religion  ought to give her a higher opinion of herself  tho  all these were far from cancelling the obligation we all were under to him  on our Jeronymo s account  as well as on hers   Well  madam  replied she  Heaven only knows how I shall be able to behave to him  now you have left every thing to myself  and how he will talk to me  by permission  on a subject so new  yet so very interesting  O that this day were over   I asked her  proceeded the Marchioness  if she would yet take further time —A week  or more   O no  said she  That must not be  I shall be Page  138 prepared to see him  I hope  by the afternoon  Pray let him come then  I am very clear now  putting her hand to her forehead  I may not be so a week  nor a day hence   Camilla then entered the room  Camilla  said the Marchioness  In what way is the dear creature now   Ever since your Ladyship left her  she has been more reserved  and thoughtful  yet her spirits are high  Her mind seems full of the Chevalier s next visit  and twice  within this half hour  she asked if he were come  She reads over and over  something she has written  lays it down  takes it up  walks about the room  sometimes with an air of dignity  at others hanging down her head  I don t like her frequent startings  Within this hour she has several times shed tears  She sighs often  She was not to be pleased with her dress  Once she would be in black  then in colours  then her white and silver was taken out  But that  she said  would give her a bridal appearance  She at last chose her plain white satten  She looks like an Angel  But O that her eyes  and her motions  shewed greater composure   You have a task before you  Chevalier  said the Bishop  What tokens are these of a disordered  yet a raised mind  We may see  from these extraordinary agitations  on the expectation of a conversation that is to end in her consent to crown your wishes  how much her heart has been in that event  May it be happy to you both   I fear nothing  said the Marchioness  as to the happiness of my child  that lies within the power of the Chevalier  I am sure of his tenderness to her   I think  said the Marquis  we will allow the Chevalier to carry his bride over to England for the first six months  and return with her to us in the second  It may give a new turn to the course of her ideas  The same places  the same persons  always in view  may sadden her reflecting heart  And  besides  the Page  139 mind of the poor Count of Belvedere may be strengthened by this absence   The Bishop applauded this thought  The Marchioness said  Reason may approve the motion  but can the mother so soon part with her child —Yet for her happiness  I must submit   Let us  said the Marquis  leave this to her choice  as the rest  Camilla  let my daughter know  that the Chevalier attends her pleasure  You would have it so  Chevalier   I bowed my assent   Camilla returned not presently  When she did  I could not come sooner  said she  My young Lady is strangely fluttered  I have been reasoning with her —Madam  turning to the Marchioness  Will you be pleased to walk up to her   Had this been the first interview  said the Bishop  I should not have wondered at her discomposure  But this disorder shews itself in a strange variety of shapes   The Marchioness  attended by Camilla  went up  I was soon
