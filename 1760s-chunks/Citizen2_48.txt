in the execution of their designs  as if they wanted to be something more than happy  But as the Europeans instruct by argument  and the Asiatics mostly by narration  were I to address them  I should convey my sentiments in the following story   Takupi had long been Prime Minister of Tipartala  a fertile country that stretches along the western confines of China  During his administration  whatever advantages could be derived from arts  learning  and commerce  were seen to bless the people  nor were the necessary precautions of providing for the security of the state forgotten  It often happens  however  that when men are possessed of all they want  they then begin to find torment from imaginary afflictions  and lessen their present enjoyments  by foreboding that those enjoyments are to have an end  The people now therefore endeavoured to find out grievances    147 and after some search  actually began to think themselves aggrieved  A petition against the enormities of Takupi was carried to the throne in due form  and the Queen who governed the country  willing to satisfy her subjects  appointed a day  in which his accusers should be heard  and the Minister should stand upon his defence   The day being arrived  and the Minister brought before the tribunal  a carrier  who supplied the city with fish  appeared among the number of his accusers  He exclaimed  that it was the custom  time immemorial  for carriers to bring their fish upon an horse in a hamper  which being placed on one side  and balanced by a stone on the other  was thus conveyed with ease and safety  but that the prisoner  moved either by a spirit of innovation  or perhaps bribed by the hamper makers  had obliged all carriers to use the stone no longer  but balance one hamper with another  an order entirely repugnant to the customs of all antiquity  and those of the kingdom of Tipartala in particular   The carrier finished  and the whole court shook their heads at the innovating Minister  when a second witness appeared  He was inspector of the city buildings  and accused the disgraced favourite of having given orders for the demolition of an ancient ruin  which obstructed the passage thro  one of the principal streets  He observed  that such buildings were noble monuments of barbarous antiquity  contributed finely to shew how little their ancestors understood of architecture  and for that reason such monuments should be held sacred  and suffered gradually to decay     148The last witness now appeared  This was a widow  who had laudably attempted to burn herself upon her husband s funeral pile  But the innovating minister had prevented the execution of her design  and was insensible to her tears  protestations  and entreaties   The Queen could have pardoned the two former offences  but this last was considered as so gross an injury to the sex  and so directly contrary to all the customs of antiquity  that it called for immediate justice   What  cried the Queen  not suffer a woman to burn herself when she thinks proper  The sex are to be very prettily tutored  no doubt  if they must be restrained from entertaining their female friends now and then with a fried wife  or roasted acquaintance  I sentence the criminal to be banished my presence for ever for his injurious treatment • the sex    Takupi had been hitherto silent  and spoke only to shew the sincerity of his resignation   Great Queen  cried he  I acknowledge my crime  and since I am to be banished  I beg it may be to some ruined town  or desolate village in the country I have governed  I shall find some pleasure in improving the soil  and bringing back a spirit of industry among the inhabitants   His request appearing reasonable  it was immediately complied with  and a courtier had orders to fix upon a place of banishment  answering the Minister s description  After some months search  however  the enquiry proved fruitless  neither a desolate village  nor a ruined town  was found in the whole kingdom  Alas  said Takupi then to the Queen  How can that country be ill governed which has neither a   149 desolate village  nor a ruined town in it  The Queen perceived the justice of his expostulation  and the Minister was received into more than former favour   LETTER XCIX  From the same   THE ladies here are by no means such ardent gamesters as the women of Asia  In this respect I must do the English justice  for I love to praise where applause is justly merited  Nothing more common in China  than to see two women of fashion continue gaming till one has won all the other s cloaths  and stripped her quite naked  the winner thus marching off in a double suit of finery  and the loser shrinking behind in the primitive simplicity of nature   No doubt  you remember when Shang  our maiden aunt  played with a sharper  First her money went  then her trinkets were produced  her cloaths followed piece by piece soon after  when she had thus played herself quite naked  being a woman of spirit  and willing to pursue her own  she staked her teeth  fortune was against her even
