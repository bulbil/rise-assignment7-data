me  you seem to be a strange people  for all that   Of one thing  my good Chevalier  methinks I should be glad —Here I am told you are married  That I knew before I left Italy  Else  let me tell you  I never would have come hither  Yet I should have got away rather than be married myself  I believe  But then perhaps it would have been to a Catholic country   What was I going to say —One thing I should be glad of  It is to see your Lady  but not if she were to see me  I came with very few cloaths  and they were not the best I had at Florence  My best of all are at Bologna  My father and mother loved to see me dressed  I dressed many a time to please them more than to please myself  For I am not a proud creature  Do you think I am  You knew me once   111 better than I knew myself  But you know little of me now  I am a runaway  And I know you won t forgive me  I can t help it  However  I should be glad to see your Lady  She dresses richly  I suppose  Well she may   I am told  she is one of the loveliest women in England  And as to her goodness—there is nobody so good  Thank God  You know  Chevalier  I always prayed  that the best of women might be called by your name   But Olivia  it seems  praises her  and Olivia saw her when she was a rambler to England  as  God help me  I am now   But Olivia s motive and mine were very different  Olivia went to England in hopes of a husband—Poor woman  I pity her   But  Chevalier  cannot I see your Lady  and she not see me  I need not be in disguise to see her  If you were with her  handing her  suppose  to church   I would not scruple to croud myself into some unobserved corner of your church on such an occasion  you would be too proud of her to mind me  And you would not know me  if you saw me  for I would stoop in my shoulders  and look down  and the cloaths I should have on would be only an English linen gown and petticoat  unadorned by ribbands or gew gaw—Not half so well dressed as your Lady s woman▪  But yet I should thank God  that you had not disgraced the regard I had once for you  I had a great deal of pride  you know  in that hope  Thank you  Sir  that you have married so lovely and so deserving a woman  She is of a good family  I hope   It wa a great disappointment to me when I came first to London  to find  that you were not there  I thought  some how or other  to catch a sight of you and your Lady  were it but as you stept into your coach  and I to have been in a chair  near  or even on foot  For  when I heard what a character you bore    112 for every kind of goodness  I  a poor fagitive  was afraid to see you  So many good lessons as you taught me  and all to come to this  Unhappy Clementina   Where will your Ladyship  but I have forbidden that stile  choose to take up your residence  said Anthony when we first landed  My servant s name is Anthony  but you shall not know his other name   We landed among a parcel of guns  at the Tower  they called it  in a boat   Laura answered for me  for he spoke in Italian  Somewhere near the Chevalier Grandison s  won t you  madam  I won t tell you what was my answer  for perhaps I am near the Thames—I don t want you to find me out  I beseech you  Chevalier  don t give yourself pain for me  I am a fugitive  Don t disgrace yourself in acknowleging any acquaintance with a creature who is poor and low  and who deserves to be poor and low  for is she not a runaway from the best of parents  But it is to avoid  not to get  a husband  you ll be pleased to remember that  Sir   But  poor Laura—I am sorry for Laura  more sorry than for myself—My brother Giacomo would kill the poor creature  I believe  if ever she were to come in his way  But she is in no fault  It was with great reluctance she obeyed her mistress  She was several times as impertinent as Camilla  Poor Camilla  I used ever hardly  She is a good creature  I used her hardly against my own nature  to make her the easier to part with me  I love her  I hope she is well  It is not worth her while to pine after me  I was an ungrateful creature to her   My Anthony is a good young man  as I told you  I think to save half his wages  and
