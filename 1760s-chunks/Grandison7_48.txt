But will you undertake  Sir   A woman wants a protector  to maintain this argument for me     121 I will  madam  and shall hope for the more success  if you will promise to lay aside all thoughts of the veil   Ah  Chevalier   Will my dearest Sister answer me one question  Is it not your hope  that by resisting their wishes  you may tire out opposition  and at last bring your friends to consent to a measure to which they have always been extremely averse   Ah  Chevalier —But if I could get them to consent—  Dear madam  is not their reasoning the same—If they could get you to consent   Ah  Chevalier   May not this be a contention for months  for years  And—  I know  Sir  your inference  You think that in a contention between parents and child  the child should yield  Is not that your inference   Not against reason  against justice  against conscience  But there may be cases  in which neither ought to be their own judge   Well  Sir  you that have yielded to a plea of conscience  God has blessed you  and may God continue to bless you  for it    Admirable Clementina   —Are fit to be a judge between us—You shall be mine  if ever the debate be brought on   No consideration  in that case  shall bias me —But may I not hope  that the dear Lady I stand before  will permit me to behold a person  whose mind I ever revered   Laura  said she  let the tea be got ready  I have been taught to drink tea  Sir  since my arrival  The gentlewoman of the house is very obliging  Permit me  Sir  to withdraw for a few moments   She sighed as she went out  leaning upon Laura   Laura returned soon after with lights  She set them   122 on the table  and giving way to a violent emotion  O my lord Grandison  said the poor girl  falling down  and embracing my knees  For the blessed Virgin s sake  prevail on my Lady to return to dear  dear Bologna   Have patience  Laura  All will be well   I  the unhappy Laura  shall be the sacrifice  The General will kill me—O that I had never accompanied my Lady in this expedition   Have patience  Laura  If you have behaved well to your Lady  I will take you into my protection  Had you a good voyage  Was the master of the vessel  were his officers  obliging   They were  Sir  or neither my Lady or I should have been now living  O Sir  we were in a dying way all the voyage  except the three last days of it  The master was the civillest of men   I asked after her fellow servant  naming him from Jeronymo s Letters  Gone out  was the answer  to buy some necessaries  O Sir  we live a sad life  Strangers to the language  to the customs of the country  all our dependence is upon this young man   I asked her after the behaviour and character of the people of the house  a widow and her three daughters  that if I heard but an indifferent account of them  I might enforce by it my intended plea to get her to Lady L s  Laura spoke well of them  The Captain of the vessel who brought them over  is related to them  and recommended them  when he knew what part of the town her Lady chose   What risques did the poor Lady run  Such different people as she had to deal with  in the contrivance and prosecution of her wild scheme  yet all to prove honest  how happy  Poor Lady  how ready was she to fly from what she apprehended to be the nearest evil  But she could not be in a capacity to weigh the dangers to which she exposed herself   Often and often  said Laura  have I  on my knees    123 besought my Lady to write to you  But she was not always well enough to resolve what to do  and when she was sedate  she would plead  that she was afraid to see you  You would be very angry with her  You would condemn her as a rash creature  And she could not bear your displeasure  She was conscious that the act she had done  bore a rash  and even a romantic  appearance  Had you been in town  Antony should have made enquiries at distance  and she might have yielded to see you  But for several days her thoughts were not enough composed to write to you  At last  being impatient to hear of the health of her father and mother  she did write   Why stays she so long from me  Laura  Attend your Lady  and tell her  that I beg the honour of her presence   Laura went to her  Her Lady presented herself with an air of bashful dignity  I met her at her entrance—My Sister  my Friend  my dearest Lady Clementina  kissing her hand  welcome
