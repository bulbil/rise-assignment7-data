fermentation  Ay  there is your mistake  replied Oquetos  Hippocrates by the word    asµ    orgasmos  does not mean the fermentation  he means rather the concoction of the humours   Thereupon our doctors got heated  One quotes the Greek text  and cites all the authors who have explained it in his sense  the other  trusting to a Latin translation  takes up the controversy in a still more positive tone  Which of the two to believe  Don Vincent was not the man to decide that question  In the mean time  finding himself obliged to choose  he gave his confidence to the party who had dispatched the greatest number of patients     I mean the elder of the two  Andros  the younger  immediately withdrew  not without flinging out a few satirical taunts at his senior on the    asµ    orgasmos   Here then was Oquetos triumphant  As he was a professor of the Sangrado school  he began by bleeding copiously  waiting till the humours were ripened before he went upon purgatives  But death  fearing  no doubt  lest this reserve of purgatives should turn the fortunes of the day  got the start of the concoction  and secured his victory over my master by a coup de main  Such was the final close of Signor Don Vincent  who had lost his life because his physician did not know Greek   Aurora having buried her father with a pomp suited to the dignity of his birth  administered to his effects  Having the whole arrangement of everything in her own breast  she discharged some of the servants with rewards proportioned to their services  and soon retired to her castle on the Tagus  between Sacedon and Buendia  I was among the number of those whom she kept  and who made part of her country establishment  I had even the good fortune to become a principal agent in the plot  In spite of my faithful report on the subject of Don Lewis  she still harboured a partiality for that bewitching young fellow  or rather  for want of spirit to combat her passion in the first instance  she surrendered at discretion  There was no longer any need of taking precautions to speak with me in private  Gil Blas  said she with a sigh  I can never forget Don Lewis  Let me make what effort I will to banish him from my thoughts  he is present to them without intermission  not as you have described him  plunged in every variety of licentious riot  but just what my fancy would paint him    tender  loving  constant  She betrayed considerable emotion in uttering these words  and could not help shedding tears  My fountains were very near playing from mere sympathy  There was no better way of paying my court than by appearing sensibly touched at her distress  My friend  continued she  after having wiped her lovely eyes  your nature is evidently cast in a benevolent mould  and I am so well satisfied with your zeal that it shall not go unrewarded  Your assistance  my dear Gil Blas  is more necessary to me than ever  You must be made acquainted with a plan which engrosses all my thoughts  though it will appear strangely eccentric  You are to know that I mean to set out for Salamanca as soon as possible  There my design is to assume the disguise of a fashionable young fellow  and to make acquaintance with Pacheco under the name of Don Felix  I shall endeavour to gain his confidence and friendship  and lead the conversation incidentally to the subject of Aurora de Guzman  for whose cousin I shall pass  He may perhaps express a wish to see her  and there is the point on which I expect the interest to turn  We will have two apartments in Salamanca  In one I shall be Don Felix  in the other  Aurora  and I flatter myself that by presenting my person before Don Lewis  sometimes under the semblance of a man  sometimes in all the natural and artificial attractions of my own sex  I may bring him by little and little to the proposed end of my stratagem  I am perfectly aware that my project is extravagant in the highest degree  but my passion drives me headlong  and the innocence of my intentions renders me insensible to all compunctious feelings of virgin apprehension respecting so hazardous a step   I was exactly in the same mind with Aurora respecting the extravagance of her scheme  Yet  unseasonable as it might seem to reflecting persons like myself  there was no occasion for me to play the schoolmaster  On the contrary  I began to practise all the arts of a thorough bred special pleader  and undertook to magnify this hair brained pursuit into a piece of incomparable wit and spirit  without the least tincture of imprudence  This was highly gratifying to my mistress  Lovers like to have their rampant fancies tickled  We no longer considered this rash enterprise in any other light than as a play  of which the characters were to be properly cast  and the business dramatically arranged  The actors were chosen out of our own domestic establishment  and the parts distributed without secret jealousy or open rupture  but then we were not players by profession  It was determined that Dame Ortiz
