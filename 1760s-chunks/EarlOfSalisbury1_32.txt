Edmund was a brave youth  and merited not only pardon   but reward  and that henceforward he should be his soldier  The  witnessess of this scene were not slow to applaud the sentiments of  their sovereign  They vied with each other in their praises of my son   whose youthful breast was but too susceptible of their impressions How  happy did we then esteem ourselves  when we saw our child rescued from  destruction  graced with the royal favour  and entrusted with an  honourable command  To us he paid his filial duty  then flew to the  beloved Edyth  to comfort her forrow and revive her spirit  confounded  and depressed by the late event  Of her  he took a tender leave  with  assurances of invariable fidelity  and passionate vows of speedy return  to compleat his happiness  then departed to perform the duties of his  new charge  But we were not as yet totally bereft of our darling object   some intervals he found for brief  yet frequent visitings  to delight us  with the accounts of his advancing fortune  So compleatly was he  now possessed with the thoughts of war and honour  so elevated and  transported by the view of courtly splendor  and the gay promises of  youthful ambition  that love seemed to hold but a second place within  his mind  and the sighs and half suppressed tears of Edyth  sometimes  consessed her jealous fear of his estrangement  He saw  and chid her  unjust suspicions  to allay them  he proposed that the holy Father  should instantly unite their hands  Their nuptials were sudden  and  their conjugal endearments  alas  too soon interrupted by our son s  necessary attendance on his royal master             The land was now threatened with all the calamities of civil war  A  second time had the bold Barons put on their armour  and collected their  vassals against John  My husband  altho  he bad already suffered in  their cause  yet still adhered with an obstinate integrity  to that side  which he deemed the great bulwark of his country  He earnestly prest  young Edmund to abandon the service of a prince whose savour was  precarious  suddenly and capriciously bestowed  and as suddenly and  capriciously withdrawn  But he was heard with reluctance and aversion   He urged the solid comforts of honest poverty and contentment  he  called it shameful  forgive me  Lady  if his homely sentiments offend   to unite with repacious foreigners  and to embrue his hands in the blood  of countrymen and brethren  His son was still unmoved  and to all his  arguments opposed one plea  his forfeit life  and the vast debt of  gratitude he owed the King  A father s authority was then exerted  He  was commanded  upon his filial obedience  to attend on the confederated  Lords  the terrors of divine vengeance were denounced on his undutiful  obstinacy  He hesitated  but the flattering prospects of ambition at  length prevailed  He forgot the submssion due to a parent s authority   full of gay hopes and impatient of controul  he hastened away to serve  his liege lord  whilst my husband  irritated  at his disobedience  pronounced something like a curse upon his unhappy  son  and followed the standard of William de Albinet the commanding  Baron             Thro  the course of these unhappy contests  Edmund encreased in honour   and still more and more approved his active valour  It is too well known  with what shameful disregard to the protection of their adherents  the  Barons suffered a number of the most faithful to their cause to be shut  up within the castle of Rochester  and to be sorely prest by the royal  army  while they themselves rioted in London  In a fatal hour  Edmund  was commanded to the siege of this castle  —O Lady  a few words are  sufficieut for the rest of his sad story  How doth the dreadful  remembrance pierce my afflicted heart  Many deeds of manhood did he  atchieve  and oftentimes did he repel the desperate valour of the  besieged  At the head of a small party  he at length ventured too  rashly to approach the castle walls  and was suddenly encountered by a  larger body of the enemy  The contest was obstinate and bloody  but his  associates were borne down by numbers  and lest him  as they yielded   singly engaged with a soldier  whose sword threatened destruction  They  rushed upon each other  they closed  they redoubled their deadly blows    till at length  a well directed stroke from the arm of Edmund fell upon  the front of his antagonist  clest his bearer  and uncovered his wounded  head  Edmund started  stood aghast  uttered some confused sounds of  horror  how can I speak it  — The ill fated youth—O for ever accursed be  the authors of every civil strife —had smote his father         — Here the disorder of the unhappy mother stopped her voice
