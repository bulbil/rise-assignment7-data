mercy with tears in my eyes  and protest that I was sorry for what I had done  They never excused me  and nine times out of ten flogged me for nothing  When I was under my father s lash  my mother  not thinking his arm stout enough  lent her assistance  instead of begging me off  The favours I received at their hands gave me such a disgust  that I quitted their house before I had completed my fourteenth year  took the Arragon road  and begged my way to Saragossa  There I associated with vagrants  who led a merry life enough  They taught me to counterfeit blindness and lameness  to dress up an artificial wound in each of my legs  and to adopt many other methods of imposing on the credulity of the charitable and humane  In the morning  like actors at rehearsal  we cast our characters  and settled the business of the comedy  We had each our exits and our entrances  till in the evening the curtain dropped  and we regaled at the expense of the dupes we had deluded in the day  Wearied  however  with the company of these wretches  and wishing to live in more worshipful society  I entered into partnership with a gang of sharpers  These fellows taught me some good tricks  but Saragossa soon became too hot to hold us  after we had fallen out with a limb of the law  who had hitherto taken us under his protection  We each of us provided for ourselves  and left the devil to take the hindmost  For my part  I enlisted in a brave and veteran regiment  which had seen abundance of service on the king s highway  and I found myself so comfortable in their quarters  that I had no desire to change my birth  So that you see  gentlemen  I was very much obliged to my relations for their bad behaviour  for if they had treated me a little more kindly  I might have been a blackguard butcher at this moment  instead of having the honour to be your lieutenant  Gentlemen     interrupted a hopeful young freebooter who sat between the captain and the lieutenant     the stories we have just heard are neither so complicated nor so curious as mine  I peeped into existence by means of a country woman in the neighbourhood of Seville  Three weeks after she had set me down in this system  a nurse child was offered her  You are to understand she was yet in her prime  comely in her person  and had a good breast of milk  The young suckling had noble blood in him  and was an only son  My mother accepted the proposal with all her heart  and went to fetch the child  It was entrusted to her care  She had no sooner brought it home  than  fancying a resemblance  she conceived the idea of substituting me for the brat of high birth  in the hope of drawing a handsome commission at some future time for this motherly office in behalf of her infant  My father  whose morals were on a level with those of clodhoppers in general  lent himself very willingly to the cheat  so that with only a change of clouts the son of Don Rodrigo de Herrera was packed off in my name to another nurse  and my mother suckled her own and her master s child at once in my little person   They may say what they will of instinct and the force of blood  The little gentleman s parents were very easily taken in  They had not the slightest suspicion of the trick  and were eternally dandling me till I was seven years old  As it was their intention to make me a finished gentleman  they gave me masters of all kinds  but I had very little taste for their lessons  and above all  I detested the sciences  I had at any time rather play with the servants or the stable boys  and was a complete kitchen genius  But tossing up for heads or tails was not my ruling passion  Before seventeen I had an itch for getting drunk  I played the devil among the chamber maids  but my prime favourite was a kitchen girl  who had infinite merit in my eyes  She was a great bloated horse god mother  whose good case and easy morals suited me exactly  I boarded her with so little circumspection that Don Rodrigo took notice of it  He took me to task pretty sharply  twitted me with my low taste  and  for fear the presence of my charmer should counteract his sage counsels  showed the goddess of my devotions the outside of the door   This proceeding was rather offensive  and I determined to be even with him  I stole his wife s jewels  and ravishing my Helen from a laundress of her acquaintance  went off with her in open day  that the transaction might lose nothing in point of notoriety  But this was not all  I carried her among her relations  where I married her according to the rites of the church  as much from the personal motive of mortifying Herrera  as from the patriotic enthusiasm of encouraging our young nobility to mend the breed  Three months after marriage  I heard that Don Rodrigo had gone the way of all flesh  The
