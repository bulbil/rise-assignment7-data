upon his toes  nay  I believe  squeezed his  hand  My blood boiled at her  though my pride  for some time  enabled  me to conceal my uneasiness  till at length her behaviour became so  arrogant and gross  that I could no longer suppress my indignation   and one day told my lover that I would immediately renounce his  correspondence    He was greatly alarmed at this unexpected declaration  and  when he  understood the cause of it  assured me  that  for the future  he would  never exchange one word with her  Satisfied with this mark of his  sincerity and regard  I released him from his promise  which he  could not possibly keep  while she and I lived upon any terms  and we  continued to visit each other as usual  though she still persisted in  her endeavours to rival me in his affection  and contracted an intimacy  with his companion  who seemed to entertain a passion for her  that she  might have the more frequent opportunities of being among us  for she  had no objection against favouring the addresses of both  One evening   I remember  we set out in my coach for the opera  and  in the way   this inamorata was so busy with her feet  that I was incensed at her  behaviour  and  when we arrived at the place  refused to alight  but   setting them down  declared my intention of returning home immediately   She was so much pleased with this intimation  that she could not conceal  the joy she felt at the thoughts of conversing with him  uninterrupted  by my presence  an opportunity with which I had never favoured her  before  This open exultation increased my anger and anxiety  I went  home  but  being still tortured with the reflection of having left them  together  adjusted myself in the glass  though I was too angry to take  notice of my own figure  and without further delay returned to the  opera    Having inquired for the box in which they sat  I took possession of one  that fronted them  and  reconnoitring them  without being perceived  had  the satisfaction of seeing him removed to as great a distance from her  as the place would permit  and his head turned another way  Composed by  this examination  I joined them without further scruple  when my young  gentleman expressed great joy at my appearance  and told me he was  determined to have left the entertainment  and come in quest of me  had  I not returned at that instant    In our way homewards  my rival repeated her usual hints  and with her  large hoop almost overshadowed my lover from my view  upon which my  jealousy and wrath recurred with such violence  that I pulled the string  as a signal for the coachman to stop  with a view of getting out  and  going home afoot  a step which would have afforded a new spectacle to  the people of Paris  But I reflected in a moment upon the folly of such  a resolution  and soon recollected myself  by calling my pride to my  assistance  I determined  however  that she should act no more scenes of  this kind in my presence  and that same night insisted upon my lover s    6 22 15  3 45 PM   dropping all intercourse and connection with this tormentor  He very  cheerfully complied with my desire  and was even glad of an occasion to  break off his acquaintance with a person about whom I had plagued him so  much    Thus was I freed from the persecution of one of those creatures   who  though of little consequence in themselves  are yet the pests of  society  and find means to destroy that harmony which reigns between two  lovers  by the intrusion of a loose appetite  void of all sensibility  and discretion  having no feelings themselves  they cannot sympathize  with those of other people  and do mischief out of mere wantonness    My lover being obliged to go to England  had settled me in a genteel  house in Paris  with a view of returning when his affairs should be  adjusted  but  when the time of his departure approached  he began to  be uneasy at the prospect of separation  and  in order to alleviate his  anxiety  desired me to accompany him to Calais  where we stayed together  three or four days  during which the dread of parting became more and  more intense  so that we determined upon my following him into England  at the first opportunity  where I should live altogether incog  that  I might be concealed from the inquiries and attempts of my lord  Even  after this resolution was fixed  we parted with all the agonies of  lovers who despair of ever meeting again  and the wind blowing very high  after he had embarked  increased my fears  But  by the return of the  packet boat I was blessed with the report of his being safe arrived in  England  and had the satisfaction of perusing
