    So saying  he bent his knee  and  taking the little portrait  he   pressed it to his lips with the ardour of an ancient lover in romance    Then  putting it into his bosom  he gracefully arose and retired   from the presence      O the fool   the egregious fool   muttered some  Nobly  most   nobly done   cried others      As Harry  vas following the Earl of Portland down stairs  Lord   Bottom came up in the crowd  and in a half whisper said You are   too great a man to day  sir  to acknowledge your old acquaintance    But not so great a fool  retorted Harry  as not to be taught my   distance with those who  like Lord Bottom  have a right to look   down upon me      After a short but sound sleep  Harry hurried home to prepare   for the reception of his new friend  He told Mr  Fenton that Sir   William was returned   how he had been obligingly made known to   him in the forementioned instance of his humanity to a stranger     and that he had promised to be with them that morning  But   pray  sir  don t tell Homely a word of the coming of his landlord    till we place them  as it were by surprise  face to face      In about an hour after a chaise and four came rapidly to the   door  and Harry instantly sprung and caught his friend in his   arms before he came to the ground      The two friends entered the parlour  caressing and caressed  and   casting looks of cordial love and delight on each other  My father    sir  said Harry  and led Sir William by the hand to Mr  Fenton    who received him with a countenance of that heart speaking com    plaisance which never fails to attach the soul of the person to   whom it is directed  Ah  my Harry  cried Sir William  I no   longer wonder at you  I see that you are all that you are by   inheritance      But  sir  continued he  you had like to have lost your son last   night  Their majesties were most unwilling to quit their hold of   him  and I believe in my soul  would willingly have adopted him   the heir of their crown  I should be very sorry  Sir William    replied Mr  Fenton  to see a circle about his head that would give   him an aching heart  I am sure that is the case with the present   royal proprietors  In a limited monarchy like ours  the station of   the prince is looked upon with a malignant eye by the envious  and    at the same time  rendered uneasy by the perpetual contests   between rights and privileges on the one part  and prerogative on   the other      Moreover  Sir William  I shall never wish to see one of my child s   disposition on the throne of Great Britain  I should be jealous of         306 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      such a person in behalf of my country  No people could be more   tenacious of their liberties than the Swedes  till Gustavns the son of   Eric ascended the throne  His manners were so amiable  his   virtues so conspicuous  his government so just  and he made so   popular an use of all his powers  that his subjects thought they   could never commit enough into his hands  But what was the   consequence   His successors made his power a precedent for their   own  without attending to the precedent of his administration      Thus you see that a prince of qualities  eminently popular  might   prove of dangerous tendency to a free people  forasmuch as he   might charm the eyes of their jealousy to sleep  and so seduce   them from that guard which is ever necessary to preclude the   encroachments of ambition      But  Sir William  may we not order your horses up   You must   not think of going till you take a plain dinner with us  A supper   too  sir  most joyfully answered the knight  I leave London in the   morning on a certain expedition  and shall not have the pleasure   of embracing you again for some time      Mr  Fenton then addressing the baronet with a smile Our   Harry here  Sir William  never saw a court before   it is natural    therefore  to think that he must have been greatly amused  and   his young heart deceived by the splendour and parade  But you   have seen and observed upon many courts of late
