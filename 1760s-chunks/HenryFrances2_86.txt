 I am sorry for your Uncle s Disorder  but am afraid he is incurable  I am sure I need not say how earnestly I wish to share and alleviate your every Distress and Fatigue  But  tho  I am  at present  denied that Happiness  I will rely on that Providence  who can  and will  in his good Time  remove every Obstacle  that prevents my lessening your Inquietudes  by taking that Share in them  which is immediately my Right  and which I would not part with  nor exchange  for any Title  that could put me into the Possession of Power  Wealth and Honours   I could say more  much more upon this Subject  but hear the Tinkling of the Postman s Bell  therefore must conclude truly and affectionately your s   Frances   Page  326  LETTER CCCXVI   Dear FANNY   I FORGOT to mention to you  in my last  another remarkable Passage in our moral Plagiarist  even Pope s much admired Simile of a Stone thrown into a standing Lake  verbatim  except the Rhyme   But let us have done with him  for he interrupted me last Post in the Prosecution of my Argument upon eternal Misery  and how  or how far  I reasoned upon that Subject  I do not recollect at present  for I have been deep involved in Affairs of this World  since I came home  But I shall proceed as Thoughts now occur  without Regard to Order  as you know I take the Liberty with you of making my Letters a Sort of Common Place Book  Not that I desire any Writer should see  or expect they would borrow any Thing from these rude Essays  which I find an Amusement to revolve in my own Mind  and a Pleasure to communicate to you  for whom alone I write  tho  it is for both our sakes I read   I am not ignorant that the Scriptures are full of penal Threats  but I do not remember that they are denounced to all Eternity  Nay I think the contrary is implied in a Text  which the Popish Clergy quote for Purgatory    there to Page  327 remain   till thou hast paid the uttermost Farthing   It is an Allusion made to the State of a Debtor  I am afraid that even eternal Happiness is not fully promised in the Scriptures  which surely is a more reasonable Faith than the other  and that this glorious Hope is rather a moral Presumption than a divine Revelation  Our principal Arguments upon this Head are drawn from the perfect Goodness of God  the Analogy running through all his Works  The natural Frame of the human Soul  it s frequent Satiety of all worldly Enjoyments   except alone it s Contemplation of the Divine Nature   it s earnest Longings after that supreme  elevated  and complete Bliss  and a certain natural Sympathy  the virtuous and religious Mind feels to be again allied to some more excellent Nature  which it seems to have  as it were  a Sense of being lately separated from  I think it may be rationally inferred from all this  that  to satisfy the natural Frame of such a Soul  it s Bliss must be eternal  for Pleasures not made to cloy can give no Satiety  Now extend  rather say limit  our heavenly Bliss to the millionth Power of a millionth Myriad of Years  which is almost infinitely beyond the Art of Numbers to enumerate  yet even the immediate Bliss of the sublimed Spirit would be  from that Reflection  rendered imperfect  as  the higher our Happiness in Possession  the more sensibly are Page  328 we affected at even the most remote Thought of parting with it  And I should prefer my State even in this vile World  satiated with frail  mortal Joys  and oppressed with life long Cares  but presuming upon the great Hope of a glorious Immortality  to the most sublime Pleasures of the next  limited in Prospect even one Thought short of Eternity  Shall we lose our earnest Relish  our virtuous Longing after Immortality in a State of certain Bliss  which operates so emphatically in our Souls  even while the Vices of the Body  and the Corruption of the Heart  occasion that Thought to be attended with a Dread of what Eternity we may be doomed to  or may the Soul  in perfect Bliss  have one Desire ungratified  In short  to bring this heart transporting  metaphysic inspiring Subject as near to Demonstration as possible  let me presume to argue thus  If the Souls of Men are not immortal  God has granted us less Happiness  than we are capable of  which is contrary to our Notion of God   with whom is Fulness of Joy  and Pleasure for evermore     Thus Man has a rational Prae sentiment of future Bliss  and a rational Deduction of it s Eternity  but he has neither one or the other with regard to future Misery  or it s Eternity  The only Dread  which appears to me natural to the Mind of Man  is that very shocking one of Annihilation   Page  329What I mean is  that Man has not any natural Forebodings of future Misery  tho  his Reason may draw some Inference about it
