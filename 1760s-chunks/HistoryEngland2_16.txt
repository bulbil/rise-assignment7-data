a declaration true in itself  but which they wrested to the most detestable purposes  Colonel Harrison  the son of a butcher  was commanded to conduct the King from Hurst castle to Windsor  When he arrived there  the council of war ordained  that he should be no longer treated with the deference due to royalty  All ceremony was laid aside  and he now saw himself deprived of his servants  and exposed to the contempt of low bred insolence  From the sixth to the twentieth of January  the time was employed in making preparations for this astonishing scene of guilt  One hundred and forty five persons were appointed Judges upon this occasion  and one Bradshaw  a practitioner of the law  was elected as President of this detestable synod   The King was now conducted from Windsor to St  James s  and was next day produced before the High Court at Westminster hall to take his tryal  He still remembered the dignity he owed to himself before such an inferior court  and  taking his place with his hat on  with a stern air  surveyed his Judges  who were also covered  When his charge was read  importing that he had been the cause of all the blood that was shed since the commencement of the rebellion  he could not repress a smile at once of contempt and indignation  He then demanded by what authority he was brought to such a tryal  To which Bradshaw replied  that he was   41 tried in the name of the commons of England  The King then objected to the legality of the tribunal  since the sanction of the Lords and his own were wanting to complete it  and refused to plead to the articles of the impeachment Being desired to answer several times  and persisting in his refusal  he was remanded to his confinement  and the court adjourned  At their second sitting the president again summoned the King to answer to his charge  and the King again demurred to the legality of his Judges  and began to open his objections  when he was interrupted by Bradshaw  and sent back to prison  as before  At his third appearance he continued firm to his purpose  and refused to reply  until he should be convinced that their proceedings were not contrary to the fundamental laws of the kingdom  The fourth and last time he appeared before this self created court of justice  as he was going thither  he was insulted by the soldiers  and the mob  who exclaimed    Justice  justice  execution  execution   He appeared before the court with the same firm composure as usual  with his hat on  and while his fentence was reading  in which he was branded with all the odious appellations that malice could suggest  he discovered no other emotions than those of pity  In walking back from this horrid tribunal  the rabble renewed the cry of  Justice  execution   and among other insults one miscreant presumed to spit in the face of his King  He patiently wiped his face   Poor souls  said he  they would treat their generals in the same manner for sixpence    A soldier more compassionate than the rest could not help imploring a blessing upon his royal head  an officer overhearing it struck the pious centinel to the ground in presence of the Monarch  who could not help saying   that the punishment exceeded the offence   The day of execution was fixed to be the third after his sentence  which when it arrived  he was conducted on foot   42 through St  James s Park to Whitehall  accompanied by Doctor Juxon  and guarded by a regiment of foot  under the command of Colonel Tomlinson  The scaffold was covered with black  in the middle of which were seen the block and ax  with two executioners in masques  The soldiers were placed round it  and an infinite concourse of spectators waited with silent horror at a greater distance  The King surveyed all their solemn preparations with calm composure  he assured the persons who stood with him upon the scaffold  that he thought himself guiltless of any crime but that of having given up the Earl of Strafford to the fury of his enemies  and that he had confidence in the mercy of Heaven  While he thus avowed his innocence  the Bishop who attended him warned him that he had but one stage more to heaven  at which the King cried out   I go from a corruptible to an incorruptible crown  where no disturbance can arrive    You are exchanged  replied the Bishop  from a temporal to an eternal crown  a good exchange    Having now taken off his cloak  he delivered his George to the Prelate  emphatically pronouncing the word   Remember   He then laid his head on the block  and stretched forth his hands as a signal  One of the men in a masque severed his head from his body at a blow  and the other  holding it up streaming with gore  cried out   This is the head of a traitor   Such was the death of Charles  who lived long enough to see the laws and constitution of his country expire before him  He had the misfortune to be bred up in high notions of the prerogative which he thought
