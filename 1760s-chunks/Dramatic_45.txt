Skettle alley     The HISTORY of MISS ANN     YOU see Mr  Poet  observed the Dancing master  you see there  that is Miss NANCY  she s a very desirable girl  faith  as showey a figure  as it is possible to represent     I owned her figure was extremely agreeable     I protest  Mr  Zaphaniel replied  she is comely amongst the daughters of delight — yea  she is fair as the fairest females of Judah —She is more precious to my sight  than the rose of Sharon  or the snow drops of Damascus  verily my friends  my heart beateth to behold her  and I would sooner chuse to have her within my fold  than both my fists full of the gold of ophir     Page  138  DANCING MASTER   This lady appeared first as a public performer at Sadler s Wells  for some years before she had performed with the public  but never until then theatrically  As she was extremely agreeable in her figure  and the novelty of her dancing added to it  with her excellence in the execution  she soon grew to be a favourite with the town  and the ensuing season  Nancy was engaged at Covent Garden Playhouse  She became vastly celebrated  admired  imitated  and followed by every body  which is always the consequence  when once a lady of pleasure becomes the fashion     The first night of her performance at the New House  our hero  whose soul was ever agitated by love and ambition  confessed himself her admirer     Let me do Master Edward this justice  to praise him for his emulation  in so spirituously aiming at every new part in comedy  which Mr  Garrick is famous for  Yet as every biographer is supposed to be the friend of the genius  whose life he celebrates  I would advise Master Edward rather  hereafter  to strike out a new cast of acting for himself  where comparisons could not be made  In justice to his merit  it must be allowed  he  who is capable of being the master Stephen  the Miser   c   c  has a sufficiency of comic abilities  to be  without buffoonery  grimace or mimickry  a capital actor  and be held in a much higher point of character  than what at present he is  Although now he is the drole and comical one of the town  and  Page  139  pleases them with his performances  it is in his power  not only to give pleasure to an audience  but to gain their esteem  and difficult as that part may be to act  it is worth his while to study it     Edward was in love to all the degrees  sallies  and dependencies of desparation —The lady observed her conquest  and enjoyed it  She knew her man  had heard that  to his girls and his gamesters  he did not mind what money he threw away  He was a trout worth tickling  and therefore returned him look for look     Emboldened by this eye language  he began to contrive a scheme  for enlarging the correspondence  He wished to talk with her  but he wanted words — he wished to write to her  but he wanted letters  therefore employed his landland  Mr  THOMAS PHILIPS  of whom more hereafter  to be his secretary     I cannot forbear mentioning a piece of ingratitude of Neddy s to that old gentleman  who behaved in this affair extremely friendly to him  and yet so far can gaming absorb all grateful principles  that Edward has betted twenty to five his landlord won t live until Lady day next  The conceit of such a bett has had a violent effect upon the mind of the old gentleman  Mr  Pond also  to the best of my remembrance  has such another wager  I have not  indeed  a syllable to say against Mr  Pond  he is as fair a sportman as ever stepped up the stand  and pays his betts as punctual  as if he was a man of quality  Yet  after he has said done to such a bett  what business had he to drive Mr  Philips from Greg s coffee house  it seems as if it was designed  as a heart breaking stroke  since  to  Page  140  be debarred from that academy of universal conversation  must be as great a damp upon the spirits of any of the curiosi  as it was to Bussy Rabutin  to be banished from the French court     When Miss Ann became a principal dancer  she had a friend   a female one I mean  to wait upon her behind the scenes  to watch her motions  and take care of her steps     This duenna was her relation  and therefore had a more than ordinary care of her charge  least detraction should be malicious     The ogles which Neddy the drole  and Nancy the desireable  reciprocally interchanged  alarmed the old lady guardianess  She trembled at the danger Nancy s honour was in  and soon as they came home that evening  thus began
