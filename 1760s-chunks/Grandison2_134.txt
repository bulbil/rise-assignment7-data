with confidence in each other  The honest attorney had prepared them to be easy after the first introduction   I offer not to read to you  said I  the will of your uncle  It is sufficient to repeat what Mr  Sylvester has no doubt  told you  That you are each of you entitled by it to a thousand pounds     335 They all bowed  and the elder brother signified their united consent to accept it upon the terms of the will   Three thousand pounds more are to be disposed of to charitable uses  at the discretion of the executor  Three other legacies are left to three different gentlemen in France  And the large remainder  which will not be less than four and twenty thousand pounds  falls to the executor  as residuary legatee  equally unexpected and undesired   The elder brother said  God bless you with it  Sir  The second said  It could not have fallen to a worthier man  The young Lady s lips moved  But words proceeded not from them  Yet her eyes shewed that her lips made me a compliment   It is ungenerous  Dr  Bartlett  to keep expecting minds in suspence  tho  with a view of obliging in the end  The surprize intended to be raised on such an occasion  carries in its appearance an air of insult  I have  said I  a great desire to do you service  Now let me know  gentlemen  I will talk to the young Lady singly  perhaps  what your expectations were upon your uncle  what will do for each of you  to enable you to enter the world with advantage  in the way you have been brought up  and  as I told your worthy friend  Mr  Sylvester  I will be ready to do you all reasonable service —But  hold  Sir  for Mr  Thomas Danby was going to speak  you shall consider before you answer me  The matter is of importance  Be explicit  I love openness and sincerity  I will withdraw  till you have consulted together  Command me in when you have determined   I withdrew to my study  And  in about a quarter of an hour  they let me know  that they were ready to attend me  I went in to them  They looked upon one another  Come  gentlemen don t fear to speak  Consider me  for your uncle s sake  as your brother     336 The elder brother was going to speak  but  hesitating  Come  said I  let me lead you into the matter—Pray  Sir  what is your present situation  What are your present circumstances   My father  Sir  was unhappy—My father—  Well  Sir  no more of your father—He could do nothing for you  Your whole dependence  I presume  was upon your uncle   My uncle  Sir  gave us all our education—My uncle gave each brother a thousand guineas for putting out each to a merchant  five hundred only of which sums were so employed  and the other five hundred guineas  are in safe hands   Your uncle  Sir  all reverence to his memory  was an excellent man   Indeed  Sir  he was   And what  Sir  is the business you were brought up to   My master is a West India merchant   And what  Mr  Danby  are your prospects in that way   Exceeding hopeful  Sir  they would have been—My master intended to propose to my uncle  had he lived to come to town  to take me in a quarter partner with him directly  and  in a twelvemonth s time  an half partner   A very good sign in your favour  Sir  You must have behaved yourself well  And will he now do it   Ah  Sir—And was silent   Upon what terms  Mr  Danby  would he have proposed to your uncle to take you in a quarter partner   Sir—he talked of—  Of what   Four thousand pounds  Sir  But my uncle never gave us hopes of more than three thousand guineas each  besides the thousand he had given  And when he had so much reason to resent the unhappy steps of   337 my father  he let us know  that he would not do my thing for us  And  to say truth  the thousand pounds left us in the will  is more than we expected   Very ingenuous  I love you for your sincerity  But  pray  tell me  Will four thousand pounds be well laid out in a quarter partnership   To say truth  Sir  my master had a view  at the year s end  if nothing unexpected happened to prevent it  to give me his niece in marriage  and then to admit me into a half of the business  which would be equivalent to a fortune of as much more   And do you love the young woman   Indeed I do   And does she countenance your address   If her uncle—I don t doubt if her uncle could have prevailed upon my uncle—  Well  Sir  I am your uncle s executor  Now  Sir
