and  I   believe  to familiarize me to the gazers  which concerned me a little    for I was dashed to hear the praises of the countrypeople  and to   see how they crowded about the chariot  Several poor people begged   my charity  and I beckoned John with my fan  and said  Divide in   the further church porch  that money to the poor  and let them come   to morrow morning to me  and I will give them something more  if they   don t importune me now  So I gave him all the silver I had  which   happened to be between twenty and thirty shillings  and this drew away   from me their clamorous prayers for charity       Mr  Martin came up to me on the other side of the chariot  and leaned on   the very door  while my master was talking to Sir Thomas  from whom he   could not get away  and said  By all that s good  you have charmed the   whole congregation  Not a soul but is full of your praises  My neighbour   knew  better than any body could tell him  how to choose for himself    Why  said he  the dean himself looked more upon you than his book       O sir  said I  you are very encouraging to a weak mind  I vow  said   he  I say no more than is truth  I d marry to morrow  if I was sure   of meeting with a person of but one half the merit you have  You are    continued he  and  tis not my way to praise too much  an ornament to   your sex  an honour to your spouse  and a credit to religion   Every   body is saying so  added he  for you have  by your piety  edified the   whole church       As he had done speaking  the dean himself complimented me  that   the behaviour of so worthy a lady  would be very edifying to his   congregation  and encouraging to himself  Sir  said I  you are very   kind  I hope I shall not behave unworthy of the good instructions I   shall have the pleasure to receive from so worthy a divine  He bowed    and went on       Sir Thomas then applied to me  my master stepping into the chariot  and   said  I beg pardon  madam  for detaining your good spouse from you  but   I have been saying  he is the happiest man in the world  I bowed to him    but I could have wished him further  to make me sit so in the notice of   every one  which  for all I could do  dashed me not a little  Mr  Martin   said to my master  If you ll come to church every Sunday with your   charming lady  I will never absent myself  and she ll give a good   example to all the neighbourhood  O  my dear sir  said I to my master    you know not how much I am obliged to good Mr  Martin  He has  by his   kind expressions  made me dare to look up with pleasure and gratitude       Said my master  My dear love  I am very much obliged  as well as you  to   my good friend Mr  Martin  And he said to him  We will constantly go   to church  and to every other place  where we can have the pleasure of   seeing Mr  Martin       Mr  Martin said  Gad  sir  you are a happy man  and I think your lady s   example has made you more polite and handsome too  than I ever knew you   before  though we never thought you unpolite  neither  And so he bowed    and went to his own chariot  and  as we drove away  the people kindly   blessed us  and called us a charming pair       As I have no other pride  I hope  in repeating these things  than in   the countenance the general approbation gives to my dear master  for his   stooping so low  you will excuse me for it  I know       In the afternoon we went again to church  and a little early  at my   request  but the church was quite full  and soon after even crowded  so   much does novelty  the more s the pity   attract the eyes of mankind    Mr  Martin came in after us  and made up to our seat  and said  If you   please  my dear friend  I will take my seat with you this afternoon    With all my heart  said my master  I was sorry for it
