I believe Mr  Fowler is  His fortune indeed is not so considerable as Sir Rowland says yours will be  But  Sir  as there is no other reason on the comparison  why I should prefer Mr  Fowler to him  I should think the worse of myself as long as I lived  if I gave a preference over such a tried affection to fortune only  And now  Sir  I expect that you will make a generous use of my frankness  lest the gentleman  if you should know him    107 may hear of it  And this I request for his sake  as I think I can never be his  as for yours I have been thus explicit   I can only say  that I am the most miserable of men —But will you  madam  give me leave to visit Mr  Reeves now and then   Not on my account Mr  Fowler  Understand it so  and if you see me  let it be with indifference  and without expectation from me  and I shall always behave myself to you  as to a man who has obliged me by his good opinion   He bowed  Sat in silence  Pulled out his handkerchief —I pitied him   But let me ask all you  my friends  who Love Mr  Orme  Was I wrong  I think I never could Love Mr  Fowler  as a wife ought to love her husband —May he meet with a worthy woman who can  And surely so good  so modest a man  and of such an ample fortune  easily▪ may  While it may be my lot  if ever I marry  to be the wife of a man  with whom I may not be so happy  as either Mr  Orme or Mr  Fowler would probably make me  could I prevail upon myself to be the wife of either  O my uncle  often do I reflect on your mercer s shop   Mr  Fowler arose  and walked disconsolately about the room  and often profoundly  and  I believe  not Greville like  sincerely sighed  His motion soon brought in the knight and Mr  Reeves at one door  and Mrs  Reeves at the other   Well  What news  What news —Good  I hope  said the knight  with spread hands—Ah my poor boy  Thus alamort  Surely  madam—  There he stopt  and looked wistfully at me  then at my cousins—Mr  Reeves  Mrs  Reeves  speak a good word for my boy  The heart that belongs to that countenance cannot be adamant surely —Dear young Lady  let your power be equalled by your mercy   Mr  Fowler  Sir Rowland  has too much generosity   108 to upbraid me  I dare say  Nor will you think me either perverse or ungenerous  when he tells you what has passed between us   Have you given him hope  then  God grant it  tho  but distant hope  Have you said you will consider—Dear blessed Lady —  O Sir  interrupted I  how good you are to your nephew  How worthily is your Love placed on him  What a proof is it of his merit  and of the goodness of your heart —I shall always have an esteem for you both —Your excuse  Sir Rowland  Yours  Mr  Fowler  Be so good as to allow me to withdraw   I retired to my own apartment  and throwing myself into a chair  reflected on what had passed  and after a while recollected myself to begin to write it down for you   As soon as I had withdrawn  Mr  Fowler  with a sorrowful heart  as my cousins told me  related all that I had said to him   Mr  Reeves was so good as to praise me for what he called my generosity to Mr  Orme  as well as for my frankness and civility to Mr  Fowler   That was the duce of it  Sir Rowland said  that were they to have no remedy  they could not find any fault in me to comfort themselves with   They put it over and over to my cousin  Whether time and assiduity might not prevail with me to change my mind  And whether an application to my friends in the country might not  on setting every thing fairly before them  be of service  But Mr  Reeves told them  that now I had opened so freely my mind  and had spoken so unexpectedly  yet so gratefully  in favour of Mr  Orme  he feared there could be no hopes   However  both gentlemen  at taking leave recommended themselves to Mr  and Mrs  Reeves for their interests  and the knight vowed that I should not come off so easily     109 So much  and adieu  my Lucy  for the addresses of worthy Mr  Fowler  Pray  however  for your Harriet  that she may not draw a worse lot   Tuesday Morning   AT a private concert last night with my cousins and Miss Clements  and again to be at the play this night  I shall be a racketer  I doubt   Mr  Fowler called here this morning  Mrs  Reeves
