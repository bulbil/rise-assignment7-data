quality for his talent of mimicking Punch and his wife Joan  when a poet of the most exquisite genius  is not able to attract the least regard  —  God forbid  Mr  Random  that I should credit assertions that degrade the dignity of our superiors so much  and represent that poor man as the most abject of all beings  No  I looked upon them as the hyperboles of passion  and though that comedy of which he spoke  did actually appear  I dare not doubt the innocence of Mr  Marmozet  who  I am told  is as much as ever in favour with the Earl  a circumstance that  surely    301 could not happen  unless he had vindicated his character to the satisfaction of his lordship —Pray forgive this long digression  and give me the hearing a little longer  for  thank heaven  I am now near the goal     Baffled in all my attempts  I despaired of seeing my play acted  and bethought myself of chusing some employment  that might afford a sure  though mean subsistence  but my landlord  to whom I was by this time considerably indebted  and who had laid his account with having his money paid all in a heap  from the profits of my third night  could not brook his disappointment  therefore made another effort in my behalf  and by dint of interest  procured a message from a lady of fashion  to Mr  Brayer  who had always professed a great veneration for her  desiring that he would set up my play forthwith  and assuring him that she and all her friends would support it in the performance  To strengthen my interest  she engaged his best actors in my cause  and in short  exerted herself so much  that it was again received  and my hopes began to revive —But Mr  Brayer  honest man  was so much engrossed by business of vast consequence  though to appearance he had nothing at all to do  that he could not find time to read it until the season was pretty far advanced  and read it he must  for notwithstanding his having perused it before  his memory did not retain one circumstance of the matter   At length he favoured it with his attention  and having proposed certain alterations  sent his duty to the lady who patronized it  and promised on his honour  to bring it on next winter  provided these alterations should be made  and the copy   302 delivered to him before the end of April —With an aching heart  I submitted to these conditions  and performed them accordingly  But fortune owed me another unforeseen mortification  Mr  Marmozet during the summer  became joint patentee with Mr  Brayer  so that when I claimed performance of articles  I was told  he could do nothing without the consent of his partner  who was pre engaged to another author   My condition was rendered desperate by the death of my good friend and landlord  whose executors obtained a judgment against my effects  which they seized  turning me out into the street naked  friendless  and forlorn  there I was arrested at the suit of my taylor  and thrown into this prison  where I have made shift to live these five weeks on the bounty of my fellow prisoners  who  I hope  are not the worse for the instruction and good offices  by which I manifest my gratitude  but in spite of all their charitable endeavours  my life was scarce tolerable  until your uncommon benevolence enabled me to enjoy it with comfort     303  CHAP  LXIV    I am seized with a deep melancholy  and become a sloven—I am relieved by my uncle—he prevails upon me to engage with his owners  as surgeon of the ship which he commands—he makes me a considerable present—entertains Strap as his steward—I take my leave of my friends  and go on board—the ship arrives at the Downs   I Shall not make any reflections on this story  in the course of which the reader must perceive how egregiously the simplicity and milky disposition of this worthy man  had been duped and abused by a set of scoundrels  who were so habituated to falshood and equivocation  that I verily believe  they could not utter one syllable of truth  though their lives depended upon their sincerity —Notwithstanding all I had suffered from the knavery and selfishness of mankind  I was amazed  and incensed at that base indifference which suffered such uncommon merit as he possessed  to languish in obscurity  and struggle with all the miseries of a loathsome jail —and should have blessed the occasion that secluded me from such a perfidious world  had not the remembrance of the amiable Narcissa  preserved my attachment to that society of which she constituted a part —The picture of that lovely creature was the constant companion of my solitude    304 How often did I contemplate the resemblance of those enchanting features that first captivated my heart  How often did I weep over those endearing scenes which her image recalled  and how often did I curse my perfidious fate for having robbed me of the fair original  In vain did my imagination flatter me with schemes of future happiness  surly reason always interposed  and in a moment overthrew
