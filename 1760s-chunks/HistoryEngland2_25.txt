weight upon Lord Stafford  who had long been a prisoner in the Tower  upon the deposition of Oates  Notwithstanding his age  his weak intellects  and the justness of his defence  he was arraigned  condemned  and executed for a plot which had its only foundation in perjury and subornation  All things threatened a renewal of the former troubles from which the kingdom had been but lately set free  The commons presented petition after petition to the King  desiring the punishment of Papists  and the abridgment of the royal prerogative  They seemed willing to intimidate the King  or to inflame the nation  At length Charles shewed a degree of fortitude that surprized even his friends  he rejected their petitions with contempt  and dissolved the parliament that had abused their power   The state of the nation at that time  with regard to religion  was thus  The principal men at court  if they professed any  were of the established church  so were all the men of great property  as well as the dregs of the people  but that body of men who voted at elections  placed between a state of opulence and penury  were in general Presbyterians  They were therefore willing to return representatives only of that persuasion   Charles  however  was resolved to try one parliament more  and appointed them to meet him at Oxford  the city of London having long been displeasing  by reason of their republican principles  The new parliament  however  seemed still more turbulent than the former  the members came armed  and attended by their friends and adherents  as if they expected to fight  and not deliberate  The representatives of   66 London were in particular attended by a numerous body of horsemen  wearing cockades  inscribed    No Popery  no Slavery   To declaim against Popery was the voice of faction in the last reign  and such it was in the present  The same spirit that had animated the former parliament  seemed redoubled in this  They insisted on the bill for excluding the Duke of York from the succession  they persisted in declaring that all Papists should be banished  and their children educated in the Protestant religion  that the doctrine of passive obedience was injurious to the rights of society  In a word  the leaders of the opposition were resolved to be displeased with every measure the King could propose  and prepared to recall the former aristocracy into the kingdom  Charles  seeing that nothing could be expected from counsels managed by party  and not deliberation  once more dissolved this parliament  with a stedfast resolution of never calling another     This was a stroke they had never expected  and which the times alone could justify  From the moment the royal and parliamentary commotions were ended  Charles seemed to rule with despotic power  and was resolved to leave to his successor the faults and the misfortunes of his administration  His temper  which had been always easy and merciful  became arbitrary  and even cruel  he entertained spies and informers round the throne  and imprisoned all such as he thought most daring in their designs  He resolved to humble the Presbyterians  all such were divested of their employments  and their places filled with such as approved the doctrine of non resistance  The clergy testified their zeal to the court by their writings and sermons  the partizans of the King were most numerous  but those of the opposite faction were more enterprising  the mutual animofity of each was inflamed into rage and rancour  and the King openly declared himself at the head of a   67 faction  The city of London particularly fell under his resentment  he deprived them of their charter  and only restored it when he had subjected the election of their magistrates to his immediate authority   Such an arbitrary administration could not fail of exciting new insurrections  several noblemen  among whom were the Duke of Monmouth  the King s natural son  the Lord Shaftesbury  Russel  Grey  and others  entered into a combination to destroy the King  which was called after the Rye house plot  The conspirators met at the house of one Shepherd  a wine merchant  where they proposed a rising in London  Bristol  Devonshire  and Cheshire  They agreed upon a declaration for justifying their design  but the scheme was at first delayed from the difficulty of the preparations previous to taking the field  and soon after discovered by one Keiling  who expected to earn a pardon for himself by impeaching his associates  As the plot began to open  new informers came in  Monmouth absconded  Grey escaped the messenger who had been sent to arrest him  Russel was committed to the Tower  and Shaftesbury  who foresaw the danger  had taken refuge in Holland  Lord Essex  Sidney  the great philosopher and lawgiver  and Hampden  grandson of the famous man of that name  were informed against  and committed to confinement   The principal informer upon this occasion was Lord Howard  a man every way debauched  and who was willing to accept infamy for safety  by his evidence Russel and Sidney were condemned  and died with that intrepidity which was worthy a better cause  While these men were thus executed  Monmouth was in the mean time soliciting his pardon  and he who
