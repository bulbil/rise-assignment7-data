      You sons of fortune  who possess your thousands a year  and find them too little for your desires  desires which grow from that very abundance  imagine every man miserable who wants them  in which you are greatly mistaken       Every real pleasure is within the reach of my little fortune  and I am very indifferent about those which borrow their charms  not from nature  but from fashion and caprice       My house is indeed less than yours  but it is finely situated  and large enough for my fortune  that part of it which belongs peculiarly to my Emily is elegant       I have an equipage  not for parade but use  and the loveliest of women prefers it with me to all that luxury and magnificence could bestow with another       The flowers in my garden bloom as fair  the peach glows as deep  as in yours  does a flower blush more lovely  or smell more sweet  a peach look more tempting than its fellows  I select it for my Emily  who receives it with delight  as the tender tribute of love       In some respects  we are the more happy for being less rich  the little avocations  which our mediocrity of fortune makes necessary to both  are the best preventives of that languor  from being too constantly together  which is all that love founded on taste and friendship has to fear       Had I my choice  I should wish for a very small addition only to my income  and that for the sake of others  not myself       I love pleasure  and think it our duty to make life as agreable as is consistent with what we owe to others  but a true pleasurable philosopher seeks his enjoyments where they are really to be found  not in the gratifications of a childish pride  but of those affections which are born with us  and which are the only rational sources of enjoyment       When I am walking in these delicious shades with Emily  when I see those lovely eyes  softened with artless fondness  and hear the music of that voice  when a thousand trifles  unobserved but by the prying sight of love  betray all the dear sensations of that bosom  where truth and delicate tenderness have fixed their seat  I know not the Epicurean of whom I do not deserve to be the envy       Does your fortune  my dear Temple  make you more than happy  if not  why so very earnestly wish an addition to mine  believe me  there is nothing about which I am more indifferent  I am ten times more anxious to get the finest collection of flowers in the world for my Emily       You observe justly  that there is nothing so insipid as women who have conversed with women only  let me add  nor so brutal as men who have lived only amongst men       The desire of pleasing on each side  in an intercourse enlivened by taste  and governed by delicacy and honor  calls forth all the graces of the person and understanding  all the amiable sentiments of the heart  it also gives good breeding  ease  and a certain awakened manner  which is not to be acquired but in mixed conversation       Remember  you and my dear Lucy dine with us to morrow  it is to be a little family party  to indulge my mother in the delight of seeing her children about her  without interruption  I have saved all my best fruit for this day  we are to drink tea and sup in Emily s apartment       Adieu  Your affectionate  ED  RIVERS       I will to morrow shew you better grapes than any you have at Temple house  you rich men fancy nobody has any thing good but yourselves  but I hope next year to shew you that you are mistaken in a thousand instances  I will have such roses and jessamines  such bowers of intermingled sweets you shall see what astonishing things Emily s taste and my industry can do     LETTER CCIV   204   To Mrs  FITZGERALD   Bellfield  Oct  22   FINISH your business  my dear girl  and let us see you again at Bellfield  I need not tell you the pleasure Mr  Fitzgerald s accompanying you will give us        I die to see you  my dear Bell  it is not enough to be happy  unless I have somebody to tell every moment that I am so  I want a confidante of my tenderness  a friend like my Bell  indulgent to all my follies  to talk to of the loveliest and most beloved of mankind  I want to tell you a thousand little instances of that ardent  that refined affection  which makes all the happiness of my life  I want to paint the flattering attention  the delicate fondness of that dear lover  who is only the more so for being a husband       You are the only woman on earth to whom I can  without the appearance of insult  talk of my Rivers  because you are the only one I ever knew as happy as myself       Fitzgerald  in the tenderness and delicacy of his mind
