offended prince  whose resentment  far from being  noble  he mid  was pitiful  ungenerous  and unjust  To this remonstrance  the officer made no reply  but shrugged up his shoulders in silent  astonishment at the hardiesse of the prisoner  and the fiacre was just  on the point of setting out  when they heard the noise of a scuffle at  the back of the coach  and the voice of Tom Pipes pronouncing   I ll  be d  d if I do   This trusty attendant had been desired by one of the  guards to descend from his station in the rear  but as he resolved to  share his master s fate  he took no notice of their entreaties  until  they were seconded by force  and that he endeavoured to repeal with his  heel  which he applied with such energy to the jaws of the soldier  who  first came in contact with him  that they emitted a crashing sound like  a dried walnut between the grinders of a Templar in the pit  Exasperated  at this outrage  the other saluted Tom s posteriors with his bayonet     6 22 15  3 45 PM   which incommoded him so much that he could no longer keep his post  but   leaping upon the ground  gave his antagonist a chuck under the chin  and  laid him upon his back  then skipping over him with infinite agility   absconded among the crowd of coaches  till he saw the guard mount before  and behind upon his master s fiacre  which no sooner set forward   than he followed at a small distance  to reconnoitre the place where  Peregrine should be confined  After having proceeded slowly through many  windings and turnings to a part of Paris  in which Pipes was an utter  stranger  the coach stopped at a great gate  with a wicket in the  middle  which  being opened at the approach of the carriage  the  prisoners were admitted  and  the guard returning with the fiacre  Tom  determined to watch in that place all night  that  in the morning  he  might make such observations as might be conducive to the enlargement of  his master   CHAPTER XLVI   By the Fidelity of Pipes  Jolter is informed of his Pupil s  fate  Confers with the Physician  Applies to the Ambassador  who  with  great difficulty  obtains the Discharge of the Prisoners on certain  Conditions   This plan he executed  notwithstanding the pain of his wound  and the  questions of the city guard  both horse and foot  to which he could make  no other answer than  Anglais  anglais   and as soon as it was light   taking an accurate survey of the castle  for such it seemed to be   into which Peregrine and Pallet had been conveyed  together with its  situation in respect to the river  he went home to the lodgings  and   waking Mr  Jolter  gave him an account of the adventure  The governor  wrung his hands in the utmost grief and consternation when he heard  this unfortunate piece of news  he did not doubt that his pupil  was imprisoned in the Bastille for life  and  in the anguish of his  apprehension  cursed the day on which he had undertaken to superintend  the conduct of such an imprudent young man  who had  by reiterated  insults  provoked the vengeance of such a mild  forbearing  administration  That he might not  however  neglect any means in his  power to extricate him from his present misfortune  he despatched Thomas  to the doctor  with an account of his companion s fate  that they might  join their interest in behalf of the captives  and the physician  being  informed of what had happened  immediately dressed himself  and repaired  to Jolter  whom he accosted in these words      Now  sir  I hope you are convinced of your error in asserting that  oppression can never be the effect of arbitrary power  Such a calamity  as this could never have happened under the Athenian democracy  nay   even when the tyrant Pisistratus got possession of that commonwealth   he durst not venture to rule with such absolute and unjust dominion  You  shall see now that Mr  Pickle and my friend Pallet will fall a sacrifice  to the tyranny of lawless power  and  in my opinion  we shall be  accessory to the ruin of this poor enslaved people if we bestir  ourselves in demanding or imploring the release of our unhappy  countrymen  as we may thereby prevent the commission of a flagrant    6 22 15  3 45 PM   crime  which would fill up the vengeance of Heaven against the  perpetrators  and perhaps be the means of restoring the whole nation to  the unspeakable fruition of freedom  For my own part  I should rejoice  to see the blood of my father spilt in such a glorious cause  provided  such a victim would furnish me with the opportunity of dissolving the  chains of slavery  and vindicating that liberty which is the birthright  of man
