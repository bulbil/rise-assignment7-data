therefore grumbled     189 and began to be troublesome  upon which  a council of war was held  and he being over ruled by a majority of voices  the whole embarkation returned to Niphon re infecta  You have been told how the beast called Legion brayed  and bellowed  and kicked  when the fate of Byn goh s expedition was known  it was disposed to be very unruly at the return of this armament  but Taycho lulled it with a double dose of his Mandragora  It growled at the giants  the sand hills  and the paradoxes of Sel uon  then brayed aloud Taycho for ever  rolled itself up like a lubberly hydra  yawned  and fell fast asleep —The other armament equipped for the operations in Fatsisio  did not arrive at the place of destination till the opportunity for action was lost  The object was the reduction of a town and island belonging to the Chinese  but before    190 the Fune with the troops arrived from Niphon  the enemy having received intimation of their design  had reinforced the garrison and harbour with a greater number of forces and Fune than the Japonese commander could bring against them  He  therefore  wisely declined an enterprize which must have ended in his own disgrace and destruction  The Chinese were successful in other parts of Fatsisio  They demolished some forts  they defeated some parties  and massacred some people  belonging to the colonies of Japan  Perhaps the tidings of these disasters would have roused the people of Niphon from the lethargy of intoxication in which they were overwhelmed  had not their delirium been keept up by some fascinating amulets from Tartary  these were no other than the bubbles which Brut an tiffi swelled into mighty    191 victories over the Chinese and Ostrog  though  in fact  he had been severely cudgelled  and more than once in very great danger of crucifixion  Taycho presented the monster with a bowl of blood  which he told it this invincible ally had drawn from its enemies the Chinese  and  at the same time  blowed the gay bubbles athwart its numerous eyes  The hydra lapped the gore with signs of infinite relish  groaned and grunted to see the bubbles dance  exclaimed    O rare Taycho    and relapsed into the arms of slumber  Thus passed the first campaign of Taycho s administration     By this time Fika kaka was fully convinced that the orator actually dealt with the devil  and had even sold him his soul for this power of working miracles on the understanding of the populace  He began to be invaded with fears  that the same    192 consideration would be demanded of him for the ease and pleasure he now enjoyed in partnership with that magician  He no longer heard himself scoffed  ridiculed  and reviled in the assemblies of the people  He no longer saw his measures thwarted  nor his person treated with disdain  He no longer racked his brains for pretences to extort money  nor trembled with terror when he used these pretences to the public  The mouth of the opposition was now glewed to his own posteriors  Many a time and often  when he heard orator Tycho declaiming against him from his rostrum  he cursed him in his heart  and was known to ejaculate    Kiss my a—se  Taycho    but little did he think the orator would one day stoop to this compliance  He now saw that insolent foulmouthed demagogue ministring with the utmost servility to his pleasure    193 and ambition  He filled his bags with the treasures of Japan  as if by inchantment  so that he could now gratify his own profuse temper without stint or controul  He took upon himself the whole charge of the administration  and left Fika kaka to the full enjoyment of his own sensuality  thus divested of all its thorns  It was the contemplation of these circumstances  which inspired the Cuboy with a belief that the devil was concerned in producing this astonishing calm of felicity  and that his infernal highness would require of him some extraordinary sacrifice for the extraordinary favours he bestowed  He could not help suspecting the sincerity of Taycho s attachment  because it seemed altogether unnatural  and if his soul was to be the sacrifice  he wished to treat with Satan as a principal  Full of this idea  he had recourse to his    194 Bonzes as the most likely persons to procure him such an interview with the prince of darkness  as should not be attended with immediate danger to his corporeal parts  but  upon enquiry  he found there was not one conjurer among them all  Some of them made a merit of their ignorance  pretending they could not in conscience give application to an art which must have led them into communication with demons  others insisted there was no such thing as the devil  and this opinion seemed to be much relished by the Cuboy  the rest frankly owned they knew nothing at all of the matter  For my part  Peacock  I not only know there is a devil  but I likewise know that he has marked out nineteen twentieths of the people of this metropolis for his prey —How now  You shake  sirrah —You have some reason  considering the experiments    195 you have been trying in the way
