to the loss of goods and estates  And furthermore  it deprives  ipso jure  all those sovereign princes  who suffer such acts of violence to be perpetrated with impunity in the lands and cities which they hold of the Church  of all the territories so held  I need not add to this  that Lewis the XIVth s edict against duelling was the greatest glory of his reign  And permit me to conclude with observing  that the base arts of poisoning  by the means of treacherous agents  and the cowardly practice of assassination by bravoes hired on purpose to wreak a private revenge  so frequent in Italy  are natural branches of this old Gothic tree  And yet  as I have before hinted  the barbarous northern nations had pleas to make in behalf of duelling  from their polity  which we have not from ours  Christianity out of the question     64 The gentlemen said  they would very seriously reflect upon all that had passed in this uncommon conversation   Sir Har  Well  but  Sir Charles  I must recur to my old note—Miss Byron—She must be mine  And I hope you will not stand in my way   Sir Ch  The Lady is her own mistress  I shall be glad to see any and all of you  gentlemen  at St  James s Square   Mr  Bag  One thing I believe it is proper to mention to Sir Charles Grandison  You know  Sir  that I brought a young man to your house  to take minutes of the conversation that passed between you and me there  in apprehension of consequences  In like apprehensions  I prevailed upon Sir Hargrave—  Sir Har  And now  Bagenhall  I could curse you for it  The affair—confound it —that I meant to be recorded for my own justification  has turned out to his honour  Now am I down in black and white  for a tame—fool —Is it not so   Mr  Jord  By no means  If you think so  Sir Hargrave  you have but ill profited by Sir Charles s noble sentiments   Sir Cha  How is this  Mr  Bagenhall   Mr  Bag  I prevailed upon Sir Hargrave to have the same young man  who is honest  discreet  and one of the swiftest short hand writers of the age  to take a faithful account of ever thing that has passed  and he is in that closet   Sir Ch  I must say  this is very extraordinary—But as I always speak what I think  if I am not afraid of my own recollection  I need not of any man s minutes   Mr  Bag  You need not in this case  Sir Charles  Nothing has passed  as Sir Hargrave observes  but what makes for your honour  We that set him to work  have more need to be afraid than you  We   65 bid him be honest  and not spare any of us  We little thought matters would have ended so amicably   Mr  Jord  Thank God they have   Mr  Mer  A very happy ending  I think   Sir Har  Not except Miss Byron consents to wipe out these marks   Mr  Bag  Mr  Cotes  your task is over  Pray step in with what you have done   The writer obeyed  Mr  Bagenhall asked  If the minutes should be read  Sir Hargrave swore No  except  as he said  he had made a better figure in the debate  Sir Charles told them  he could not stay to hear them  But that  as they were written  and as he had been allowed before a copy of what passed between him and Mr  Bagenhall  he should be glad to have one now  and the rather  as Sir Hargrave should have an instance  after he had perused it  of his readiness to condemn himself  if he found he had been wanting either to his own character  or to that of any man present   They consented  that I should send Sir Charles the first fair copy  Sir Charles then took his leave   The gentlemen all stood silent for several minutes  when they returned from attending him to the door  looking upon ane another as if each expected the other to speak  But when they spoke  it was all in praise of Sir Charles  as the most modest  the most polite  the bravest  and noblest of men  Yet his maxims  they said  were confoundedly strange  impracticable for such sorry dogs as them  that was their phrase  to practise   But Sir Hargrave seemed greatly disturbed and dejected  He could not  he said  support himself under the consciousness of his own inferiority  But what could I do  said he  The devil could not have made him fight  Plague take him  he beat me out of my play     66 And yet  said Mr  Merceda  a tilting bout seems no more to him than a game at pushpin   You would have thought so  said Sir Hargrave  had you observed with what a sleight  and with what unconcernedness  he pushed down my drawn sword with his hand
