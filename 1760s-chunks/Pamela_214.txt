all  And the very clothes she wears  so very low is she    are entirely the effects of your bounty  and that of your good mother    This makes me a little sad  For  alas  sir  I am so much oppressed   by your favours  and the sense of the obligations I lie under  that   I cannot look up with the confidence that I otherwise should  on this   awful occasion       There is  my dear Pamela  said he  where the power is wanting  as much   generosity in the will as in the action  To all that know your story    and your merit  it will appear that I cannot recompense you for what   I have made you suffer  You have had too many hard struggles and   exercises  and have nobly overcome  and who shall grudge you the reward   of the hard bought victory   This affair is so much the act of my   own will  that I glory in being capable of distinguishing so much   excellence  and my fortune is the more pleasurable to me  as it gives   me hope  that I may make you some part of satisfaction for what you have   undergone       This  sir  said I  is all goodness  unmerited on my side  and makes my   obligations the greater  I can only wish for more worthiness   But how   poor is it to offer nothing but words for such generous deeds   And to   say  I wish   For what is a wish  but the acknowledged want of power to   oblige  and a demonstration of one s poverty in every thing but will       And that  my dear girl  said he  is every thing   Tis all I want   Tis   all that Heaven itself requires of us  But no more of these little   doubts  though they are the natural impulses of a generous and grateful   heart  I want not to be employed in settlements  Those are for such to   regard  who make convenience and fortune the prime considerations  I   have possessions ample enough for us both  and you deserve to share   them with me  and you shall do it  with as little reserve  as if you   had brought me what the world reckons an equivalent  for  as to my own   opinion  you bring me what is infinitely more valuable  an experienced   truth  a well tried virtue  and a wit and behaviour more than equal to   the station you will be placed in  To say nothing of this sweet person    that itself might captivate a monarch  and of the meekness of temper    and sweetness of disposition  which make you superior to all the women I   ever saw       Thus kind and soothing  and honourably affectionate  was the dear   gentleman  to the unworthy  doubting  yet assured Pamela  and thus   patiently did he indulge  and generously pardon  my impertinent   weakness  He offered to go himself to Lady Jones  in the morning  and   reveal the matter to her  and desire her secrecy and presence  but I   said  That would disoblige the young Ladies Darnford  No  sir  said I  I   will cast myself upon your generous kindness  for why should I fear the   kind protector of my weakness  and the guide and director of my future   steps       You cannot  said he  forgive Mrs  Jewkes  for she must know it  and   suffer her to be with you  Yes  sir  said I  I can  She is very civil   to me now  and her former wickedness I will forgive  for the sake of the   happy fruits that have attended it  and because you mention her       Well  said he  I will call her in  if you please   As you please  sir    said I  And he rung for her  and when she came in  he said  Mrs  Jewkes    I am going to entrust you with a secret  Sir  answered she  I will be   sure to keep it as such  Why  said he  we intend to morrow  privately as   possible  for our wedding day  and Mr  Peters and Mr  Williams are to be   here  as to breakfast with me  and to shew Mr  Peters my little chapel    As soon as the ceremony is over  we will take a little airing in the   chariot  as we have done at other times  and so it will not be wondered   that we are dressed  And the two parsons have promised secrecy  and will   go home  I believe you can t well avoid letting one of the maids into
