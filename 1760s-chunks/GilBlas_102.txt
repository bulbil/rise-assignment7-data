under my influence  I do not fear bringing you under this roof   I thanked Laura for her good dispositions  My gratitude took the readiest way to prove itself to her comprehension  and my tender thrillings expressed more than words  We had a pretty long conversation together  and it might have lasted till this time  if a little skipping fellow had not come to tell my nymph of the side scenes that Arsenia was inquiring for her  We parted  I left the house  in the sweet hope of soon living there scot free  and my face was shown up again at the door in two days  I was looking out for you  said my accomplished scout  to assure you that you are a messmate at this house  Come  follow me  I will introduce you to my mistress  At these words  she led me into a suite of five or six rooms on a floor  in a regular gradation of costly furniture and tasteful equipment   What luxury  What magnificence  I thought myself in presence of a vicequeen  or  to mend the poverty of the comparison  in a fairy palace  where all the riches of the earth were collected  In fact  there were the productions of many people and of many countries  so that one might describe this residence as the temple of a goddess  whither every traveller brought some rare product of his native land  as a votive offering  The divinity was reclining on a voluptuous satin sofa  she was lovely in my eyes  and pampered with the fumes of daily sacrifices  She was in a tempting dishabille  and her polished hands were elegantly busy about a new head dress for her appearance that evening  Madam  said the abigail  here is that said steward  take my word for it  you will never get one more to your liking  Arsenia looked at me very inquisitively  and did not find me disagreeable  Why  this is something  Laura  cried she  a very smart youth truly  I foresee that we shall do very well together  Then directing her discourse to me  Young man  added she  you suit me to a hair  and I have only one observation to make  you will be pleased with me  if I am so with you  I answered that I should do my utmost to serve her to her heart s content  As I found that the bargain was struck  I went immediately to fetch in my own little accommodations  and returned to take formal possession       CH  X     Much such another as the foregoing   IT was near the time of the doors opening  My mistress told me to attend her to the theatre with Laura  We went into her dressing  room  where she threw off her ordinary attire  and assumed a more splendid costume for the stage  When the performance began  Laura shewed me the way  and seated herself by my side where I could see and hear the actors to advantage  They disgusted me for the most part  doubtless because Don Pompeyo had prejudiced me against them  Several of them were loudly applauded  but the fable of the pig would now and then come across my mind   Laura told me the names of the actors and actresses as they made their entrances  Nor did she stop there  for the hussy gave some highly seasoned anecdotes into the bargain  Her characters were  crack brain for this  impertinent fellow for that  That delicate sample of sin  who depends on her wantonness for her attractions  goes by the name of Rosarda  a bad speculation for the company  She ought to be sent with the next cargo to New Spain  she may answer the purpose of the viceroy  Take particular notice of that brilliant star now coming forward  that magnificent setting sun  increasing in bulk as its fires become less vivid  That is Casilda  If from that distant day when she first laid herself open to her lovers  she had required from each of them a brick to build a pyramid  like an ancient Egyptian princess  the edifice by this time would have mounted to the third heaven  In short  Laura tore all character to pieces by her scandal  Heaven forgive her wicked tongue  She blasphemed her own mistress   And yet I must own my weakness  I was in love with the wench  though her morals were not strictly pure  She scandalized with so winning a malignity that one liked her the better for it  Off went the jill flirt between the acts  to see if Arsenia wanted her  but instead of coming straight back to her place  she amused herself behind the scenes  in laying herself out for the little flatteries of all the wheedling fellows  I dogged her once  and found that she had a very large acquaintance  No less than three players did I reckon up  who stopped to chat with her one after the other  and they seemed to be on a very improvable footing  This was not quite so well  and for the first time in my life I felt what jealousy was  I returned to my seat so absent and out of spirits  that Laura remarked it as soon as she came back to me
