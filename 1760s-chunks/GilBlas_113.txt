should personate Aurora s aunt  under the name of Donna Kimena de Guzman  with a valet and waiting maid by way of attendance  and that Aurora  with the swashing outside of a gay spark  was to take me for her valet de chambre  with one of her women disguised as a page  to be more immediately about her person  The drama thus filled up we returned to Madrid  where we understood Don Lewis still to be  though it was not likely to be long till his departure for Salamanca  We got up with all possible haste the dresses and decorations of our wild comedy  When they were in complete order  my mistress had them packed up carefully  that they might come out in all their gloss and newness on the rising of the curtain  Then  leaving the care of her family to her steward  she began her journey in a coach drawn by four mules  and travelled towards the kingdom of Leon  with those of her household who had some part to play in the piece   We had already crossed Old Castile  when the axle tree of the coach gave way  The accident happened between Avila and Villaflor  at the distance of three or four hundred yards from a castle near the foot of a mountain  Night was coming on  and the measure of our troubles seemed to be heaped up and overflowing  But there passed accidentally by us a countryman  by whose assistance we were relieved from our difficulties  He acquainted us that the castle yonder belonged to Donna Elvira  widow of Don Pedro de Penar√©s  at the same time giving us so favourable a character of that lady  that my mistress sent me to the castle with a request of a night s lodging  Elvira did not disgrace the good word of the countryman  She received me with an air of hospitality  and returned such an answer to my compliment as I wished to carry back  We all went to the castle  whither the mules dragged the carriage with considerable difficulty  At the gate we met the widow of Don Pedro  who came out to meet my mistress  I shall pass over in silence the reciprocal civilities which were exchanged on this occasion  in compliance with the usage of the polite world  I shall only say that Elvira was a lady rather advanced in years  but remarkably well bred  with an address superior to that of most women in doing the honours of her house  She led Aurora into a sumptuous apartment  where  leaving her to rest herself for a short time  she looked after everything herself  and left nothing undone which could in the least contribute to our comfort  Afterwards  when supper was ready  she ordered it to be served up in Aurora s chamber  where they sat down to table together  Don Pedro s widow was not of a description to cast a slur on her own hospitalities  by assuming an air of abstraction or sullenness  Her temper was gay  and her conversation lively without levity  for her ideas were dignified  and her expressions select  Nothing could exceed her wit  accompanied by a peculiarly fine turn of thought  Aurora appeared as much to be delighted as myself  They became sworn friends  and mutually engaged in a regular correspondence  As our carriage could not be repaired till the following day  and we should have encountered some perils by setting out late at night  it was determined that we should take up our abode at the castle till the damage was made good  All the arrangements were in the first style of elegance  and our lodgings were correspondent to the magnificence of the establishment in other respects   The day after  my mistress discovered new charms in Elvira s conversation  They dined in a large hall  where there were several pictures  One among the rest was distinguished for its admirable execution  but the subject was highly tragic  A principal figure was a man of superior mien  lying lifeless on his back  and bathed in his own blood  yet in the very embraces of death he wore a menacing aspect  At a little distance from him you might see a young lady in a different posture  though stretched likewise on the ground  She had a sword plunged in her bosom  and was giving up her last sighs  at the same time casting her dying glances at a young man who seemed to suffer a mortal pang at losing her  The painter had besides charged his picture with a figure which did not escape my notice  It was an old man of a venerable physiognomy  sensibly touched with the objects which struck his sight  and equally alive with the young man to the impressions of the melancholy scene  It might be said that these images of blood and desolation affected both the spectators with the same astonishment and grief  but that the outward demonstrations of their in ward sentiments were different  The old man  sunk in a profound melancholy  looked as if he was bowed down to the ground  while the youth mingled some thing like the extravagance of despair with the tears of affliction  All these circumstances were depicted with touches so characteristic and affecting  that we could not take our eyes off the performance  My mistress desired to know the subject of the piece  Madam  said Elvira  it
