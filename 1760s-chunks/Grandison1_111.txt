lie down for about two more  At night we had Sir John Allestree  and his nephew  and Miss Allestree  and Miss Clements  and Lady Betty  at supper  and cards  But  my stomach paining me  about eleven I was permitted to retire to bed   On Thursday I finished my Letters  relating my distresses  and deliverance  It was a dreadful subject  I rejoiced when I had concluded it   The same day Mr  Reeves received Sir Charles s Letter  inclosing that of the wretched Wilson  I have often heard my grandfather observe  that men of truly great and brave spirits are most tender and merciful  and that  on the contrary  men of base and low minds are cruel  tyrannical  insolent  where ever they have power  What this short Letter  so full of lenity  of mercy  of generous and humane care for the future good of a criminal  and extended to unborn families  as well as to all his acquaintance and friends in being  enables one to judge of the truly heroic Sir Charles Grandison  and what I have experienced of the low  groveling  unmanly insults of Sir Hargrave Pollexfen  I a poor defenceless silly girl  trick d into his power   are flagrant proofs of the justice of the observation   I wish  with all my heart  that the best woman in the world were queen of a great nation  and that it were in my power  for the sake of enlarging Sir Charles s ability to do good  to make him her consort  Then   273 am I morally sure  that I should be the humble means of making a whole people happy   But as we had all been informed from other hands  of Sir Hargrave s threatnings of Sir Charles s life  Wilson s postscript has fastened a weight on my heart  that will not be removed till the danger is overblown   This day I had Miss Grandison s compliments  with tender enquiries  brought me  and a desire  that as she supposed my first visit would be one of thankful duty  meaning to Church  for so I had told her it should  my next might be to her   Yesterday I received the welcome packet  from so many kind friends  And I prosecuted with the more vigour  for it  my writing task  How easily do we glide into subjects that please us —How swiftly flies the pen —The characters of Sir Charles and of Miss Grandison were the subjects  and I was amazed to find how much I had written in so short a time   Miss Grandison sent me in the evening of this day her compliments  joined with those of her brother  who was but just returned from Canterbury   I wonder what Sir Charles could do at Canterbury so many days  and to have nobody there whom his sister knows   She would have made me a visit  she sent me word  but that as she expected her brother in the morning  she had intended to have brought him with her  She added  that this morning  Saturday  they should both set out for Colnebrooke  in hopes of the Earl and Countess of L  arriving there as this night from Scotland   Do you think  Lucy  it would not have been generous in Sir Charles to have made one visit  before he set out for so many days  to that Canterbury  to the creature on whom he had laid such an obligation  I can only mean as to the civility of the thing  you must think  since he was so good to join in  nay  to propose  the farther intimacy  as a brother  and friend  and so forth—I wish that Sir Charles be as sincere in   274 his professions as his sister  He may in his travels  possibly he may  have mistaken some gay weeds for fine flowers  and pick d them up  and brought them with him to England  And yet  if he has done so  he will  even then  be superior to thousands  who travel  and bring home nothing  but the weeds of foreign climates   He once said  as Miss Grandison told me  that the Countess of L  is still a more excellent woman than my Charlotte  Ah  Sir Charles  You can tell fibs  I believe  I will not forgive in you  those slighter deviations  which we are too apt to pass by in other  even tolerable  men   I wish you may be in earnest  my good Sir  in proposing to cultivate an intimate friendship with me  as that of a brother to a sister  Shake your head  my Lucy  if you will  I mean no more  that I may be intitled to tell you your faults  as I see them  In your sister Harriet  you shall find  tho  a respectful  yet an openeyed monitor  Our Charlotte thinks you cannot be wrong in any thing   All I fear is  that Sir Charles s tenderness was designed to be excited  only while my spirits were weak  Yet he bespoke a brotherly relation to me  before Mr  Reeves  when he brought me home  and supposed
