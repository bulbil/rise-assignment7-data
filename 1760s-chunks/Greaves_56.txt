to whom he was not an utter stranger  The populace surrounded the house  and testified their approbation in loud huzzas  Captain Crowe was more than ever inspired with veneration for his admired patron  and more than ever determined to pursue his footsteps in the road of chivalry  Fillet and his friend the lawyer could not help conceiving an affection  and even a profound esteem for the exalted virtue  the person  and accomplishments of the knight  dashed as they were with a mixture of extravagance and insanity  Even Sir Launcelot himself was elevated to an extraordinary degree of self complacency on the fortunate issue of his adventure  and became more and more persuaded that a knight errant s profession might be exercised  even in England  to the advantage of the community  The only person of the company who seemed unanimated with the general satisfaction was Mr  Thomas Clarke  He had  not without good reason  laid it down as a maxim  that knight errantry and madness were synonymous terms  and that madness  though exhibited in the most advantageous and agreeable light  could not change its nature  but must continue a perversion of sense to the end of the chapter  He perceived the additional impression which the brain of his uncle had sustained  from the happy manner in which the benevolence of Sir Launcelot had so lately operated  and began to fear it would be in a little time quite necessary to have recourse to a commission of lunacy  which might not only disgrace the family of the Crowes  but also tend to invalidate the settlement which the captain had already made in favour of our young lawyer   Perplexed with these cogitations  Mr  Clarke appealed to our adventurer s own reflection  He expatiated upon the bad consequences that would attend his uncle s perseverance in the execution of a scheme so foreign to his faculties  and entreated him  for the love of God  to divert him from his purpose  either by arguments or authority  as  of all mankind  the knight alone had gained such an ascendency over his spirits  that he would listen to his exhortations with respect and submission   Our adventurer was not so mad  but that he saw and owned the rationality of these remarks  He readily undertook to employ all his influence with Crowe  to dissuade him from his extravagant design  and seized the first opportunity of being alone with the captain  to signify his sentiments on this subject   Captain Crowe   said he   you are then determined to proceed in the course of knight errantry    I am   replied the seaman   with God s help  d ye see  and the assistance of wind and weather —  What dost thou talk of wind and weather   cried the knight  in an elevated tone of affected transport   without the help of Heaven  indeed  we are all vanity  imbecility  weakness  and wretchedness  but if thou art resolved to embrace the life of an errant  let me not hear thee so much as whisper a doubt  a wish  a hope  or sentiment with respect to any other obstacle  which wind or weather  fire or water  sword or famine  danger or disappointment  may throw in the way of thy career  When the duty of thy profession calls  thou must singly rush upon innumerable hosts of armed men  Thou must storm the breach in the mouth of batteries loaded with death and destruction  while  every step thou movest  thou art exposed to the horrible explosion of subterranean mines  which  being sprung  will whirl thee aloft in air  a mangled corse  to feed the fowls of heaven  Thou must leap into the abyss of dreadful caves and caverns  replete with poisonous toads and hissing serpents  thou must plunge into seas of burning sulphur  thou must launch upon the ocean in a crazy bark  when the foaming billows roll mountains high—when the lightning flashes  the thunder roars  and the howling tempest blows  as if it would commix the jarring elements of air and water  earth and fire  and reduce all nature to the original anarchy of chaos  Thus involved  thou must turn thy prow full against the fury of the storm  and stem the boisterous surge to thy destined port  though at the distance of a thousand leagues  thou must ——   Avast  avast  brother   exclaimed the impatient Crowe   you ve got into the high latitudes  d ye see  If so be as you spank it away at that rate  adad  I can t continue in tow—we must cast off the rope  or  ware timbers  As for your  osts and breeches  and hurling aloft  d ye see— your caves and caverns  whistling tuods and serpents  burning brimstone and foaming billows  we must take our hap—I value  em not a rotten ratline  but as for sailing in the wind s eye  brother  you must give me leave—no offence  I hope—I pretend to be a thoroughbred seaman  d ye see—and I ll be d—ned if you  or e er an arrant that broke biscuit  ever sailed in a three mast vessel within five points of the wind  allowing for variation and lee way  No  no  brother  none of your
