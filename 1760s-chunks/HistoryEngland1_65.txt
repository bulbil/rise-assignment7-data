was  with reason  alarmed at this formidable invasion  he found himself unable to resist so powerful an antagonist  and therefore had recourse to treaty  this succeeded better than arms could have done  the two Kings had an interview at the bridge of Perpignan  and  upon the payment of a stipulated sum  Edward led his forces back to England  The English King wanted to return home to his mistresses  to spend upon them the money he had gotten  and the French Monarch hoped to be able to refuse those sums which he had only given a promise to pay   Edward returned to renew his cruelty and his excesses  His brother Clarence  who had assisted him in gaining the crown  had been  for some time  treated with indifference and disrespect  this Clarence thought an ill recompence for his former services  and often gave himself the liberty of invective in the King s absence  In this posture of things  the King happened to kill a favourite deer  belonging to Mr  Thomas Burdet  a friend of the Duk s  poor Burdet  dropping some hasty expressions against the King  was sentenced to die  and executed in two days after  The Duke of Clarence  upon the death of his friend  vented his grief in renewed reproaches against his brother  the King  unmindful of the ties of kindred  or the debt of gratitude  by which he was bound   191 had him arraigned  condemned  and executed  he was smothered in a butt of Malmsey wine  When men arrive at a certain station of greatness  their regards are dissipated on too great a number of objects to feel parental affection  the ties of nature are only strong with those who have but few friends or few dependants   The rest of Edward s life was spent in riot and debauchery  in gratifications that are pleasing only to the narrow mind  in useless treaties  in which he was ever deceived  and in empty threats against the Monarch who had deceived him  His parliament  now merely the ministers of his will  consented to a war with France  at a time when it was impossible it could succeed  all the lords unanimously declared  that they thought it both just and necessary  The people seemed equally pleased at the prospect of a war  which might  in some measure  alleviate their domestic calamities  great preparations were made on every side  but Edward died in the midst of all his expectations  The character of this Prince is easily summed up  his good qualities were courage and beauty  his bad qualities—every vice   I am   c   LETTER XXV   HORRID as the last reign was  you must prepare for events in the next still more heinous  Edward left two sons  the eldest of whom  a boy between twelve and thirteen  was proclaimed King  by the name of Edward V  The Queen  his mother  being herself newly raised among the nobility  seemed willing to hide the meanness of   192 her former condition amongst a number of new promotions  this  as might naturally be expected  was displeasing to the old nobility  and the Duke of Gloucester  a monster both for the cruelty of his heart  and the deformity of his body  fomented their discontents  Having gained over Lord Hastings  the Duke of Buckingham  and some other lords  to his interests  he made them a long speech  tending to shew the danger that hung over their heads  if the Queen should have the government in her hands  he enlarged upon the usurpations of her family  and the lengths they would be apt to run upon being invested with the supreme power  In short  he spared neither dissimulation nor artifice  nor oaths  to get the guardianship of the minority  and the custody of the King s person   His first step  after being declared Protector of the kingdom  was to get the King s brother  also a boy of about seven  who  with the Queen his mother  had taken sanctuary in Westminster abbey  The Queen foresaw the dangers which threatened her family  and  parting with her child  clasped him  with a last embrace  to her breast  and took leave of him with a shower of tears  The Duke of Gloucester  on the other hand  took his young nephew in his arms  and  clasping him  with feigned affection  declared  that  while he himself was alive  the child should never want a parent  The young King  finding that he was to have the pleasure of his brother s company  was greatly rejoiced  without considering the fatal intention of these preparations  a few days after  the Protector  upon a pretext of guarding them from danger  conveyed them both to the Tower   Having thus secured their persons  the Protector s next step was to spread a report of their illegitimacy    193 and  by pretended obstacles  to put off the day of the young King s coronation  Lord Stanley  a man of deep penetration  was the first to disclose his fears of the Protector s having ill designs  he communicated his suspicions to Lord Hastings  who was firmly attached to the young King  perhaps this lord s wishes
