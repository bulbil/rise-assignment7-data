full  as good an account of matters and things as I could   My time passes rather more tolerably than I expected  The dean’s    family seem to have broke the solitary spell that hung over the house  and we have company you see every day  Mr Arnold never fails  I always make him play  he is very obliging  and  if he were not good natured  I should tire him   August 22  I have had a letter from Sir George  he mentions not Mr Faulkland  I too am endeavouring to forget him  When my mother goes to London  I will try to prevail on her to let me go down to Sidney castle  I have no inclination to go to town  and less to stay here  We are to have a concert to morrow  at Mr Arnold’s house  My lively good old dean touches the bass viol  his daughter sings prettily  I am to bear my part too  so that we begin to grow a little sociable   August 30  Are you not tired of my Grimston journal  my Cecilia  Day after day rolls on  and the same dull repetition  Lady Grimston  the Dean  and Mr Arnold  perpetually  there is no bearing this  you cry  Well  but here is a new personage arrived to diversity the scene a little  Lady Grimston’s daughter  a sweet woman  but her mother does not seem fond of her  It amazes me  for she is perfectly amiable  both in temper and person  she is a widow of about eight and twenty  Lady Grimston appears to treat her with a distance very unmaternal  and the poor young woman seems so humbled  that I pity her  She is come but on a visit  and we shall lose her in a week  for which I am very sorry  as I have taken a fancy to her   September 1  Poor Mrs Vere  that is the name of Lady Grimston’s daughter  I can now give you the cause of her mother’s coldness to her  I had it from herself  she told me her little history this evening in the garden  with a frankness that charmed me   How happy you are  dear Miss Bidulph  said she  you seem to be blessed with one of the tenderest of parents  I am indeed  I answered  she is one of the best of mothers  and the best of women  She sighed  and a tear started into her eye  I too was happy once  said she  when my indulgent father lived  I hope  madam  Lady Grimston is to you  what my good mother is to me  She shook her head  No  Miss Bidulph  it must be but too obvious to you that she is not  I should not have introduced the subject  if the cold severity of her looks    were not so apparent that you must have taken notice of them  My mother is  undoubtedly  a very good woman  and you may naturally suppose  that my conduct has been such as to deserve her frowns  I will therefore tell you my melancholy  though short story  It is now about twelve years since Mr Vere paid his addresses to me  He was the eldest son of a gentleman of family and fortune  who then lived in this country  I was about sixteen  and the darling of my father  who was perhaps the more indulgent to me  as he knew my mother’s severity  Mr Vere was but two years older than myself  and a childish courtship had gone on for some time between us  before it was suspected by any body  and to say the truth  before I was well aware of the consequences myself  It happened  that an elderly gentleman of a great estate  just at that time saw and liked me  and directly made proposals to my mother  as she was very well known to hold the reins of government in her family   This offer  I suppose  was advantageous  for she immediately consulted my father upon it  or rather gave him to understand that she meant to dispose of her daughter in marriage   My father  who had no objection to the match  told her he was very well satisfied  provided I liked the gentleman  but said  he hoped she would not think of putting any force on my inclinations  My eldest sister had been married some time before by my mother’s sole authority  and quite contrary to her own liking  the marriage had not turned out happily  and my father was resolved not to have me sacrificed in the same way   My mother told him  she was sorry he had such romantic notions  as to think a girl of my age capable of having any ideas of preference for one man more than another  that she took it for granted I had never presumed to entertain a thought of any man as yet  and supposed her precepts had not been so far thrown away upon me  as that I could let it enter into my head that any thing but parental authority was to guide me in my choice   My father  from the gentleness of his nature  had been so accustomed to acquiesce
