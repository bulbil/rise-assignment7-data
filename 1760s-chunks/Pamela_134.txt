throw away myself  because my ruin seemed inevitable  to my   short sighted apprehension       So he was pleased to say  Well  Pamela  I am glad you are come of your   own accord  as I may say  give me your hand  I did so  and he looked   at me very steadily  and pressing my hand all the time  at last said  I   will now talk to you in a serious manner       You have a good deal of wit  a great deal of penetration  much beyond   your years  and  as I thought  your opportunities  You are possessed   of an open  frank  and generous mind  and a person so lovely  that you   excel all your sex  in my eyes  All these accomplishments have engaged   my affection so deeply  that  as I have often said  I cannot live   without you  and I would divide  with all my soul  my estate with you    to make you mine upon my own terms  These you have absolutely rejected    and that  though in saucy terms enough  yet in such a manner as makes   me admire you the more  Your pretty chit chat to Mrs  Jewkes  the last   Sunday night  so innocent  and so full of beautiful simplicity  half   disarmed my resolution before I approached your bed  And I see you so   watchful over your virtue  that though I hoped to find it otherwise  I   cannot but confess my passion for you is increased by it  But now    what shall I say farther  Pamela   I will make you  though a party  my   adviser in this matter  though not  perhaps  my definitive judge       You know I am not a very abandoned profligate  I have hitherto been   guilty of no very enormous or vile actions  This of seizing you  and   confining you thus  may perhaps be one of the worst  at least to persons   of real innocence  Had I been utterly given up to my passions  I should   before now have gratified them  and not have shewn that remorse and   compassion for you  which have reprieved you  more than once  when   absolutely in my power  and you are as inviolate a virgin as you were   when you came into my house       But what can I do  Consider the pride of my condition  I cannot endure   the thought of marriage  even with a person of equal or superior degree   to myself  and have declined several proposals of that kind  How then    with the distance between us in the world s judgment  can I think of   making you my wife   Yet I must have you  I cannot bear the thoughts   of any other man supplanting me in your affections  and the very   apprehension of that has made me hate the name of Williams  and use him   in a manner unworthy of my temper       Now  Pamela  judge for me  and  since I have told you  thus candidly  my   mind  and I see yours is big with some important meaning  by your eyes    your blushes  and that sweet confusion which I behold struggling in your   bosom  tell me  with like openness and candour  what you think I ought   to do  and what you would have me do       It is impossible for me to express the agitations of my mind  on this   unexpected declaration  so contrary to his former behaviour  His manner   too had something so noble  and so sincere  as I thought  that  alas for   me  I found I had need of all my poor discretion  to ward off the blow   which this treatment gave to my most guarded thoughts  I threw myself at   his feet  for I trembled  and could hardly stand  O sir  said I  spare   your poor servant s confusion  O spare the poor Pamela   Speak out  said   he  and tell me  when I bid you  What you think I ought to do  I cannot   say what you ought to do  answered I  but I only beg you will not ruin   me  and  if you think me virtuous  if you think me sincerely honest  let   me go to my poor parents  I will vow to you  that I will never suffer   myself to be engaged without your approbation       Still he insisted upon a more explicit answer to his question  of what   I thought he ought to do  And I did  As to my poor thoughts of what you   ought to do  I must needs say  that indeed I think you ought to regard
