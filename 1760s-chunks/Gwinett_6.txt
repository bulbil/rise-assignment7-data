laughed at me  and said I should soon have prize money enough to make me amends  so I was obliged to submit  and for three months they forced me to work before the mast  At last we met the same fate that you did  and by adventures parallel to your own  you see me here on my return to our native country  and if you will accompany me  I shall think myself happy   There was nothing to prevent my going to England  and the ship being to sail in ten days  in it Mr  Collins and I determined to embark  I told my master my resolution  he did not disuade me from it  because it gave him the opportunity of getting the office I held to a kinsman of his  to whom that very day I delivered up my trust  And here providence was no less remarkable to me than in other particulars of my life  for that night the pirates siezed on the young man  while locking up the wards  took the keys from him  and left him for dead  and before the alarm could be given  five of them made their escape  by means of piratical boats that kept hovering about the coast   On the 18th of November  1712  having made all my little preparations  I sent my trunk aboard the Nostra Senora  Michael Deronza  master  The vessel was to sail that evening  and about seven o clock being sitting with Signor Gaspar  my master a lad came up and said the boat had been waiting for me and that Mr  Collins was on board  I ran into the house for a small bundle and taking leave of the family  made what haste I could to the quay but found the boat had put off  and left word I should overtake them at a little bay  I ran along the shore  and imagined I had a sight of the boat  and  Â 16 hallooed as loud as I could  they answered and put about to take me in  but we had scarce got fifty yards from land  when  on looking for Mr  Collins  I missed him  and then I found that instead of getting aboard my own boat  which I could see a considerable way a head  I had got into a boat belonging to the pirates  I attempted to leap overboard  but was prevented by one of the crew  who gave me a stroke on the head  which laid me senseless  and I found afterwards they mistook me for one of their men  who had been sent to purchase something in the town   With these Pirates I continued some years  till they  upon a dispute  threw me overboard  I was saved by a boat belonging to a Spanish ship  After various misfortunes  our ship was taken by an Algerine Roger  the greatest part of the crew was killed  and the rest taken prisoners  among which I was one  having lost one of my legs in the action   After this  I passed a long and painful slavery in Algiers  till with other English captives  I was released by agreement between the Day of Algiers  and his Brittanick Majesty  In the year 1730  I returned to England  The first thing I did was to enquire after my relations  but all those nearest to me were dead  and I found Mr  Collins had never returned home  so I suppose he died in his passage  Though not an old man  I was so enfeebled by hardships  that I was unable to work  and being without any manner of support  I could think of no way of getting my living but by begging   FINIS
