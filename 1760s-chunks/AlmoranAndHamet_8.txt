 but this is impossible to the king    for nothing equivalent to what he would give up  could be offered him    But as a king has not equal temptations to do wrong  neither is he   equally exposed to opposition  when he does right  the measures of a   substitute are frequently opposed  merely from interest  because the   leader of a faction against him  hopes  that if he can remove him by   popular clamour  he shall succeed to his power  but it can be no man s   interest to oppose the measures of a king  if his measures are good    because no man can hope to supplant him  Are not these the precepts of   the Prophet  whose wisdom was from above     Let not the eye of   expectation be raised to another  for that which thyself only should   bestow  suffer not thy own shadow to obscure thee  nor be content to   derive that glory  which it is thy prerogative to impart         But is the prince   said ALMORAN  always the wisest man in his   dominions  Can we not find  in another  abilities and experience  which   we do not possess  and is it not the duty of him who presides in the   ship  to  place the helm in that hand which can best steer it         A prince   said HAMET   who sincerely intends the good of his people    can scarce fail to effect it  all the wisdom of the nation will be at   once turned to that object  whatever is his principal aim  will be that   of all who are admitted to his council  for to concur with his   principal aim  must be the surest recommendation to his favour  Let us    then  hear others  but let us act ourselves        As ALMORAN now perceived  that the longer this conversation continued    the more he should be embarrassed  he put an end to it  by appearing to   acquiesce in what HAMET had proposed  HAMET withdrew  charmed with the   candour and flexibility which he imagined he had discovered in his   brother  and not without some exultation in his own rhetoric  which  he   supposed had gained no inconsiderable victory  ALMORAN  in the mean   time  applauded himself for having thus far practised the arts of   dissimulation with success  fortified himself in the resolutions he had   before taken  and conceived new malevolence and jealousy against HAMET                CHAP  IV          While HAMET was exulting in his conquest  and his heart was overflowing   at once with self complacency  and affection to his brother  he was   told  that OMAR was waiting without  and desired admittance  HAMET   ordered that he should be immediately introduced  and when OMAR entered    and would have prostrated himself before him  he catched him in his arms   in a transport of affection and esteem  and having ordered that none   should interrupt them  compelled him to sit down on a sofa       He then related  with all the joy of a youthful and an ardent mind  the   conversation he had had with ALMORAN  intermixed with expressions of   the highest praise and the most cordial esteem  OMAR was not without   suspicion  that the sentiments which ALMORAN had first expressed with   such vehemence of passion  were still predominant in his mind  but of   these suspicions he did not give the least hint to HAMET  not only   because to communicate suspicions is to accuse without proof  but   because he did not think himself at liberty to make an ill report of   another  though he knew it to be true  He approved the sentiments of   HAMET  as they had indeed been infused by his own instructions  and some   precepts and cautions were now added  which the accession of HAMET to a   share of the imperial power made particularly necessary        Remember   said OMAR   that the most effectual way of promoting virtue    is to prevent occasions of vice  There are  perhaps  particular   situations  in which human virtue has always failed  at least    temptation often repeated  and long continued  has seldom been finally   resisted  In a government so constituted as to leave the people exposed   to perpetual seduction  by opportunities of dissolute pleasure or   iniquitous gain  the multiplication of penal laws will only tend to   depopulate the kingdom  and disgrace the state  to devote to the   scymitar and the bow string  those who might have been useful to   society  and to leave the rest dissolute turbulent and factious  If the   streets not only abound
