my eyes  that my want of courage alone had hindered me from  making him privy to my passion  though I owned  I should have married  Lord W    even though he had disapproved of my choice  I reminded him of  the uneasy life I led at home  and frankly acknowledged  that I loved my  admirer too well to live without him  though  if he would favour me with  his consent  I would defer my intention  and punctually observe any day  he would fix for our nuptials  Meanwhile I begged he would permit me to  send a message to Lord W    who was waiting in expectation of my coming   and might  without such notice  imagine I was playing the jilt  He  granted this last request  in consequence of which I sent a letter to  my lover  who  when he received it  had almost fainted away  believing I  should be locked up in the country  and snatched for ever from his arms   Tortured with these apprehensions  he changed clothes immediately  and   taking horse  resolved to follow me whithersoever we should go    After dinner  we proceeded as far as Brentford  where we lay  intending  to be at my father s country house next night  and my admirer putting up  at the same inn  practised every expedient his invention could suggest  to procure an interview  but all his endeavours were unsuccessful   because I  who little dreamed of his being so near  had gone to bed upon  our first arrival  overwhelmed with affliction and tears  In the morning  I threw myself at my father s feet  and conjured him  by all the ties  of paternal affection  to indulge me with an opportunity of seeing my  admirer once more  before I should be conveyed from his wishes  The  melancholy condition in which I preferred this supplication  melted the  tender heart of my parent  who yielded to my supplications  and carried  me back to town for that purpose    Lord W    who had watched our motions  and arrived at his own lodgings  before we arrived at my father s house  obeyed my summons on the  instant  and appeared before me like an angel  Our faculties were for  some minutes suspended by a conflict of grief and joy  At length I  recovered the use of speech  and gave him to understand  that I was  come to town in order to take my leave of him  by the permission of my  father  whom I had promised to attend into the country next day  before  he would consent to my return  the chief cause and pretence of which  was my earnest desire to convince him  that I was not to blame for the    6 22 15  3 45 PM   disappointment he had suffered  and that I should see him again in a  month  when the nuptial knot should be tied in spite of all opposition    My lover  who was better acquainted with the world  had wellnigh run  distracted with this information  He swore he would not leave me  until  I should promise to meet and marry him next day  or  if I refused to  grant that request  he would immediately leave the kingdom  to which he  would never more return  and  before his departure  sacrifice Lord H   B    son to the Duke of S  A    who was the only person upon earth who  could have betrayed us to my father  because he alone was trusted with  the secret of our intended marriage  and had actually undertaken to give  me away  an office which he afterwards declined  Lord W   also affirmed   that my father decoyed me into the country with a view of cooping me up   and sequestering me entirely from his view and correspondence    In vain I pleaded my father s well known tenderness  and used all the  arguments I could recollect to divert him from his revenge upon Lord  H    He was deaf to all my representations  and nothing  I found  would  prevail upon him to suppress his resentment  but a positive promise to  comply with his former desire  I told him I would hazard everything to  make him happy  but could not  with any regard to my duty  take such a  step without the knowledge of my parent  or  if I were so inclined  it  would be impracticable to elude his vigilance and suspicion  However   he employed such pathetic remonstrances  and retained such a powerful  advocate within my own breast  that  before we parted  I assured him my  whole power should be exerted for his satisfaction  and he signified his  resolution of sitting up all night  in expectation of seeing me at his  lodgings    He had no sooner retired  than I went into the next room  and  desired my father to fix a day for the marriage  in which case I would  cheerfully wait upon him into the country  whereas
