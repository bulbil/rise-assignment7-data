effect —The surgeon was confounded —not that there wanted grounds for such  or greater  marks of impatience —but  twas unexpected too  in the four years he had attended him  he had never seen any thing like it in my uncle Toby s carriage —he had never once dropp d one fretful or discontented word —he had been all patience —all submission   —We ose the right of complaining sometimes by forbearing it —but we oftner treble the force —The surgeon was astonished —but much more so  when he heard my uncle Toby go on  and peremptorily insist upon his healing up    the wound directly —or sending for Monsieur Ronjat  the King s Serjeant Surgeon  to do it for him   The desire of life and health is implanted in man s nature —the love of liberty and enlargement is a sister passion to it  These my uncle Toby had in common with his species —and either of them had been sufficient to account for his earnest desire to get well and out of doors —but I have told you before that nothing wrought with our family after the common way —and from the time and manner in which this eager desire shew d itself in the present case  the penetrating reader will suspect there was some other cause or crotchet for it in my uncle Toby s head —There was so  and  tis the subject of the next chapter to set forth what that cause and crotchet was     I own  when that s done   twill be time to return back to the parlour fire side  where we left my uncle Toby in the middle of his sentence   CHAP  V   WHEN a man gives himself up to the government of a ruling passion —or  in other words  when his HOBBY HORSE grows head strong —farewell cool reason and fair discretion   My uncle Toby s wound was near well  and as soon as the surgeon recovered his surprize  and could get leave to say as much—he told him   twas just beginning to incarnate  and that if no fresh exfoliation happen d  which there was no signs of —it would be dried up in five or six    weeks  The sound of as many olympiads twelve hours before  would have convey d an idea of shorter duration to my uncle Toby s mind —The succession of his ideas was now rapid —he broil d with impatience to put his design in execution —and so  without consulting further with any soul living —which  by the bye  I think is right  when you are predetermined to take no one soul s advice —he privately ordered Trim  his man  to pack up a bundle of lint and dressings  and hire a chariot and four to be at the door exactly by twelve o clock that day  when he knew my father would be upon  Change —So leaving a bank note upon the table for the surgeon s care of him  and a letter of tender thanks for his brother s —he pack d up his maps  his books of fortification  his instruments   c —and  by the help of a    crutch on one side  and Trim on the other —my uncle Toby embark d for Shandy Hall   The reason  or rather the rise  of this sudden demigration  was as follows   The table in my uncle Toby s room  and at which  the night before this change happened  he was sitting with his maps   c  about him —being somewhat of the smallest  for that infinity of great and small instruments of knowledge which usually lay crouded upon it —he had the accident  in reaching over for his tobacco box  to throw down his compasses  and in stooping to take the compasses up  with his sleeve he threw down his case of instruments and snuffers —and as the dice took a run against him  in his endeavouring to catch the snuffers    in falling —he thrust Monsieur Blondel off the table and Count de Pagan o top of him    Twas to no purpose for a man  lame as my uncle Toby was  to think of redressing all these evils by himself —he rung his bell for his man Trim —Trim  quoth my uncle Toby  pri thee see what confusion I have here been making —I must have some better contrivance  Trim —Can st not thou take my rule and measure the length and breadth of this table  and then go and bespeak me one as big again —Yes  an  please your Honour  repliedTrim  making a bow —but I hope your Honour will be soon well enough to get down to your country seat  where —as your Honour takes so much pleasure in fortification  we could manage this matter to a T     I must here inform you  that this servant of my uncle Toby s  who went by the name of Trim  had been a Corporal in my uncle s own company —his real name was James Butler —but having got the nick name of Trim in the regiment  my uncle Toby  unless when he happened to be very angry with him  would never call him by any other name   The poor fellow had been disabled for the service  by a wound on his left knee by a musket bullet  at the battle of Landen
