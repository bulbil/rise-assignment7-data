support kings upon their thrones for nothing     I may invade  as well as guard against invasion  They shall know   whom they dare ofiend          Something has provoked your highness s wrath  which I am   afraid my ignorance would aggravate          I will teach the respect that s due to sovereignty  I am not   king of England  curbed in my will  and limited in power   my sub    jects are my slaves   they dare not think of any other law besides   my pleasure  Death   can you think it   My minister at the   court of England writes me word that a base plebeian merchant   has had the assurance to demand payment for the goods he sent me   last year  for the support and splendour of my court  and  on its   not being deducted from the subsidy  to refuse supplying me this   year  and even to threaten complaining to their parliament  Now    judge you if a sovereign prince  whose forces are their security in   time of danger  can brook such insolence  And  to conclude the   whole  what did the English minister say when my minister remon    strated with him upon this affair  but that  by the laws of England    no man could be compelled to part with his property against his   will  or hindered to complain  if he thought himself aggrieved  and   that the laws were sacred  and must not be infringed  Think  now    if I can with honour keep an alliance with such people  till I have   received satisfaction   I  whose subjects have no property nor laws   but my will  to be treated in such a manner by a vile trader   It is   not to be borne         I am very sorry to hear of this affair  and particularly at this   time  because  if your highness should break with the English now    when they think they want your men  they may be provoked never   to deal with yoiu  highness for them another time  when they have   no other occasion for them  only to do your highness a service          Why  there may be something in that   and  therefore  if they   will send me the merchandise I want  and raise the subsidy  perhaps   I may not refuse them the succours they desire          How much does your highness require to have the subsidy   raised           I have not thought of that yet  But surely they cannot be so   unreasonable as to expect my men at the same rate  now in time of   danger  as they had them in peace  when there was nothing at all   for thsm to do   but they could work at their trades at home  and   maintain themselves  without wearing out their uniform  or any   other expense to me        â€¢ That is very true  if your highness was not to consider at the   name time that even then they paid you as much as if it was a         220 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     time of war  and indeed  more than any other nation will  or can    pay you now   for  as to the promises of Prance  they are not to bÂ«   depended on at all  whereas England always pays weU          I do not care  What I have gotten here  I will keep  by way of   reprisal for the insult offered to my honour  and  if they will have   my troops  they shall pay me over again for them   so  say no more   on that head          I submit   but how will your highness subsist them at home in   the meantime   There must be an immediate remittance made of   some of this money to Holland to buy provisions  for your maga    zines are quite exhausted  and the constant demand for men  to   supply the troops you have agreed for  and recruit the losses they   have sustained in battle  have not left sufficient to cultivate the   land          Then let them starve   I shall not expend a penny to support   them  Could not the women and children work   I wonder you   should dare to mention such a thing  If I lay out this money  what   is to support the splendour of my court  since this Englishman has   refused to supply me           I
