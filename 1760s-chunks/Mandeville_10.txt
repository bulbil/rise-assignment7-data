be next        1 48       me  I kissed her hand with an involuntary fervor  which called up into her cheeks a blush  celestial rosy red   When we entered the house  we were struck with the propriety  the beauty  the simplicity of all around us  the apartments were few  but airy and commodious  the furniture plain  but new and in the most beautiful taste  no ornaments but vases of flowers  no attendants but country girls  blooming as the morn  and drest with a neatness inexpressible      After an elegant cold dinner  and a desert of cream and the best fruits in season  we walked into the wood with which the house was surrounded  the romantic variety of which it is impossible to describe  all was nature  but nature in her most pleasing form  We wandered over the sweetly  varied scene  resting at intervals in arbours of intermingled roses and jessamines  till we reached a beautiful mossy grotto           1 49       wildly lovely  whose entrance was almost hid by the vines which flaunted over its top  Here we found tea and coffee prepared as if by invisible hands  Lady Anne exclaimed that all was enchantment  and Lord Belmont s eyes sparkled with that lively joy  which a benevolent mind feels in communicating happiness to others      Lady Julia alone seemed not to taste the pleasures of the day  Her charming eyes had a melancholy languor I never saw in them before  she was reserved  silent  absent  and would not have escaped Lady Anne s raillery  had not the latter been too much taken up with the lovely scene to attend to any thing but joy        As friendship has a thousand groundless fears  I tremble lest I should have been so unhappy as to offend her  I remember she seemed displeased with my kissing her hand  and scarce spoke to me the whole          1 50       day  I will beg of Lady Anne to ask the cause  for I cannot support the apprehension of having offended her      It was with difficulty Lord Belmont forced us at night from this charming retirement  which he calls his hermitage  and which is the scene of his most pleasing hours  To Lady Anne and me it had a charm it did not want  the powerful charm of novelty  it is about four miles from Belmont house  not far distant from the extremities of the park  To this place  I am told  Lord Belmont often retires  with his amiable family  and those who are particularly happy in his esteem  to avoid the hurry of company  and give himself up entirely to the uninterrupted sweets of domestic enjoyment  Sure no man but Lord Belmont knows how to live     H  Mandeville           1 51         To Colonel Bellville      LORD  these prudes    no  don t let me injure her    these people of high sentiment  are so tremblingly alive all o er    there is poor Harry in terrible disgrace with Lady Julia for only kissing her hand  and amidst so bewitching a scene too  that I am really surprized at his moderation     all breathed the soul of pleasure     rosy bowers and mossy pillows  cooing doves and whispering Zephyrs    I think my Lord has a strange confidence in his daughter s insensibility  to trust her in these seducing groves  and with so divine a fellow in company     But  as I was saying  she takes the affair quite seriously  and makes it an offence of the blackest die    Well  I thank my stars  I am not one of these sensitive plants  he might have kissed my hand twenty times  without my being more alarmed than if a          1 52       fly had settled there  nay  a thousand to one whether I had even been conscious of it at all      I have laughed her out of her resentment  for it is really absurd  the poor fellow was absolutely miserable about it  and begged my intercession  as if it had been a matter of the highest importance  When I saw her begin to be ashamed of the thing  Really  my dear  says I  I am glad you are convinced how ridiculous your anger was  for ill natured people might have put strange constructions     I know but one way of accounting rationally    if I was Harry  I should be extremely flattered    one would almost suppose    This answered     I carried my point  and transferred the pretty thing s anger to me  it blushed with indignation  drew up  and  if mamma had not happened to enter the room at that instant  an agreeable scene of altercation would probably have ensued
