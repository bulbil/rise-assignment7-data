all parted when daylight peeped in on our festivities  and went to bed each of us at our separate homes   My master getting up at his usual time  about noon  dressed himself  He went out  I followed him  and we paid a visit to Don Antonio Centellés  with whom we found one Don Alvaro de Acuna  He was an old gentleman  who gave lectures on the science of debauchery  The rising generation  if they wanted to qualify themselves for fine gentlemen  put themselves under his tuition  He moulded their ductile habits to pleasure  taught them to make a distinguished figure in the world  and to squander their substance  he had no qualms as to running out his own  for the deed was done  After these three blades had exchanged the compliments of the morning  Centellés said to my master    In good faith  Don Matthias  you could not have come at a more lucky time  Don Alvar is come to take me with him to a dinner  given by a citizen to the Marquis de Zenette and Don Juan de Moncade  and you shall be of the party  And what is the citizen s name  said Don Matthias  Gregorio de Noriega  said Don Alvar  and I will describe the young man in two words  His father  a rich jeweller  is gone abroad  to attend the foreign markets  and left his son  at his departure  in the enjoyment of a large income  Gregorio is a blockhead  with a turn for every sort of extravagance  and an awkward hankering after the reputation of wit and fashion  in despite of nature  He has begged of me to give him a few instructions  I manage him completely  and can assure you  gentlemen  that I lead him a rare dance  His estate is rather deeply dipped already  I do not doubt it  exclaimed Centellés  I see the vulgar dog in an almshouse  Come  Don Matthias  let us honour the fellow with our acquaintance  and be in at the death of him  Willingly  answered my master  for I delight in seeing the fortune of these plebeian upstarts kicked over  when they affect to mix among us  Nothing  for instance  ever entertained me so much as the downfall of the toll gatherer s son  whom play  and the vanity of figuring among the great  have stripped  till he has not a house over his head  Oh  as for that  replied Don Alvar  he deserves no pity  he is as great a coxcomb in his poverty as he was in his prosperity   Centellés and my master accompanied Don Alvar to Gregorio de Noriega s party  We went there also  that is  Mogicon and myself  both in ecstasy at having an opportunity of spunging on a citizen  and pleasing ourselves with the thought of being in at the death of him  At our entrance  we observed several men employed in preparing dinner  and there issued from the ragouts they were taking up  a vapour which conciliated the palate through the medium of the nostrils  The Marquis de Zenette and Don Juan de Moncade were just come  The founder of the feast seemed a great simpleton  He aped the man of fashion with a most clumsy grace  a wretched copy of admirable originals  or  more properly  an idiot in the chair of wisdom and taste  Figure to yourself a man of this character in the centre of five bantering fellows  all intent on making a jest of him  and drawing him into ridiculous expenses  Gentlemen  said Don Alvar  after the first interchange of civilities  give me leave to introduce you to Signor Gregorio de Noriega  a most brilliant star in the hemisphere of fashion  He owns a thousand amiable qualities  Do you know that he has an highly cultivated understanding  Choose your own subject  he is equally at home in every branch  from the subtilty and closeness of logic  to the elementary science of the criss cross row  Oh  this is really too flattering  interrupted the scot and lot gentleman with a very uncouth laugh  I might  Signor Alvaro  put you to the blush as you have put me  for you may truly be termed a reservoir as it were  a common sewer of erudition  I had no intention  replied Don Alvaro  to draw upon myself so savoury an encomium  but truly  gentlemen  Signor Gregorio cannot fail of establishing a name in the world  As for me  said Don Antonio  what is so delightful in my eyes  far above the honours of logic or the criss cross row  is the tasteful selection of his company  Instead of demeaning himself to the level of tradesmen  he associates only with the young nobility  and sets the expense at nought  There is an elevation of sentiment in this conduct which enchants me  and this is what you may truly call disbursing with taste and judgment   These ironical speeches were only the preludes to a continual strain of banter  Poor Gregorio was attacked on all hands  The wits shot their bolts by turns  but they made no impression on the fool  on the contrary  he took all they said literally  and seemed highly pleased with his guests
