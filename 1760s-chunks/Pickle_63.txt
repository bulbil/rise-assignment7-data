the  country seeking whom they may devour  and warily discouraged all his  advances  Chagrined by so many unsuccessful endeavours  he began to  despair of accomplishing his aim  and  as the last suggestion of his  art  paid off his lodging  took horse at noon  and departed  in all  appearance  for the place from whence he had come  He rode  but a few  miles  and in the dusk of the evening returned unseen  alighted at  another inn  ordered Pipes to stay within doors  and keeping himself  incognito  employed another person as a sentinel upon Emilia   It was not long before he reaped the fruits of his ingenuity  Next day  in the afternoon he was informed by his spy that the two young ladies  were gone to walk in the park  whither he followed them on the instant   fully determined to come to an explanation with his mistress  even in  presence of her friend  who might possibly be prevailed upon to interest  herself in his behalf   When he saw them at such a distance that they could not return to  town before he should have an opportunity of putting his resolution in  practice  he mended his pace  and found means to appear before them  so suddenly  that Emilia could not help expressing her surprise in a  scream  Our lover  putting on a mien of humility and mortification   begged to know if her resentment was implacable  and asked why she had  so cruelly refused to grant him the common privilege that every  criminal enjoyed   Dear Miss Sophy   said he  addressing himself to her  companion   give me leave to implore your intercession with your cousin   I am sure you have humanity enough to espouse my cause  did you but know  the justice of it  and I flatter myself that by your kind interposition  I may be able to rectify that fatal misunderstanding which hath made  me wretched     Sir   said Sophy   you appear like a gentleman  and  I doubt not but your behaviour has been always suitable to your  appearance  but you must excuse me from undertaking any such office  in behalf of a person whom I have not the honour to know     Madam    answered Peregrine   I hope Miss Emy will justify my pretensions to that  character  notwithstanding the mystery of her displeasure  which  upon  my honour  I cannot for my soul explain     Lord  Mr  Pickle   said  Emilia  who had by this time recollected herself   I never questioned  your gallantry and taste  but I am resolved that you shall never have  cause to exercise your talents at my expense  so that you tease yourself  and me to no purpose  Come  Sophy  let us walk home again     Good God   madam   cried the lover  with great emotion   why will you distract me  with such barbarous indifference  Stay  dear Emilia   I conjure you on    6 22 15  3 45 PM   my knees to stay and hear me  By all that is sacred  I was not to blame   You must have been imposed upon by some villain who envied my good  fortune  and took some treacherous method to ruin my love    Miss Sophy  who possessed a large stock of good nature  and to whom  her cousin had communicated the cause of her reserve  seeing the young  gentleman so much affected with that disdain which she knew to be  feigned  laid hold on Emilia s sleeve  saying  with a smile   Not quite  so fast  Emily  I begin to perceive that this is a love quarrel  and  therefore there may be hopes of a reconciliation  for I suppose both  parties are open to conviction     For my own part   cried Peregrine   with great eagerness   I appeal to Miss Sophy s decision  But why do I  say appeal  Though I am conscious of having committed no offence  I am  ready to submit to any penance  let it be never so rigorous  that my  fair enslaver herself shall impose  provided it will entitle me to  her favour and forgiveness at last   Emily  well nigh overcome by this  declaration  told him  that as she taxed him with no guilt  she expected  no atonement  and pressed her companion to return to town  But Sophy   who was too indulgent to her friend s real inclination to comply with  her request  observed that the gentleman seemed so reasonable in his  concessions  that she began to think her cousin was in the wrong  and  felt herself disposed to act as umpire in the dispute   Overjoyed at this condescension  Mr  Pickle thanked her in the most  rapturous terms  and  in the transport of his expectation  kissed the  hand of his kind mediatrix  a circumstance which had a remarkable effect  on the countenance of Emilia  who did not seem to relish the warmth of  his acknowledgment
