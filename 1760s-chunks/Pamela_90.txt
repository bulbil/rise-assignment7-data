his diligence shall not be   slackened  and he will leave it to Providence and himself to dispose   of him as he shall be found to deserve  He has signified to me  that he   shall soon send a special messenger with the packet to you  and I have   added to it what has occurred since          Sunday       I am just now quite astonished   I hope all is right   but I have a   strange turn to acquaint you with  Mr  Williams and Mrs  Jewkes came to   me both together  he in ecstacies  she with a strange fluttering sort of   air  Well  said she  Mrs  Pamela  I give you joy  I give you joy   Let   nobody speak but me  Then she sat down  as out of breath  puffing and   blowing  Why  every thing turns as I said it would  said she  Why  there   is to be a match between you and Mr  Williams  Well  I always thought   it  Never was so good a master   Go to  go to  naughty  mistrustful Mrs    Pamela  nay  Mrs  Williams  said the forward creature  I may as good   call you  you ought on your knees to beg his pardon a thousand times for   mistrusting him       She was going on  but I said  Don t torture me thus  I beseech you    Mrs  Jewkes  Let me know all   Ah  Mr  Williams  said I  take care  take   care   Mistrustful again  said she  Why  Mr  Williams  shew her your   letter  and I will shew her mine  they were brought by the same hand       I trembled at the thoughts of what this might mean  and said  You have   so surprised me  that I cannot stand  nor hear  nor read  Why did you   come up in such a manner to attack such weak spirits  said he  to Mrs    Jewkes  Shall we leave our letters with Mrs  Pamela  and let her recover   from her surprise  Ay  said she  with all my heart  here is nothing but   flaming honour and good will  And so saying  they left me their letters   and withdrew       My heart was quite sick with the surprise  so that I could not   presently read them  notwithstanding my impatience  but  after a while    recovering  I found the contents thus strange and unexpected           MR  WILLIAMS        The death of Mr  Fownes has now given me the opportunity I have long   wanted  to make you happy  and that in a double respect  For I shall   soon put you in possession of his living  and  if you have the art of   making yourself well received  of one of the loveliest wives in England    She has not been used  as she has reason to think  according to her   merit  but when she finds herself under the protection of a man of   virtue and probity  and a happy competency to support life in the manner   to which she has been of late years accustomed  I am persuaded she will   forgive those seeming hardships which have paved the way to so happy a   lot  as I hope it will be to you both  I have only to account for and   excuse the odd conduct I have been guilty of  which I shall do when I   see you  but as I shall soon set out for London  I believe it will not   be yet this month  Mean time  if you can prevail with Pamela  you need   not suspend for that your mutual happiness  only let me have notice of   it first  and that she approves of it  which ought to be  in so material   a point  entirely at her option  as I assure you  on the other hand    I would have it at yours  that nothing may be wanting to complete your   happiness                                     I am your humble servant           Was ever the like heard   Lie still  my throbbing heart  divided as   thou art  between thy hopes and thy fears   But this is the letter Mrs    Jewkes left with me           MRS  JEWKES        You have been very careful and diligent in the task  which  for reasons   I shall hereafter explain
