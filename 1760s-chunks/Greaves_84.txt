warm expostulation had passed between Aurelia and her uncle  who next morning dismissed Dolly  without permitting her to take leave of her mistress  and that same day moved to another part of the town  as she afterwards learned of the landlady  though she could not inform her whither they were gone  That  when she was turned away  John Clump  one of the footmen  who pretended to have a kindness for her  had faithfully promised to call upon her  and let her know what passed in the family  but as he did not keep his word  and she was an utter stranger in London  without friends or settlement  she had resolved to return to her mother  and travelled so far on foot since yesterday morning   Our knight  who had expected the most dismal tidings from her lamentable preamble  was pleased to find his presaging fears disappointed  though he was far from being satisfied with the dismission of Dolly  from whose attachment to his interest  joined to her influence over Mr  Clump  he had hoped to reap such intelligence as would guide him to the haven of his desires  After a minute s reflection  he saw it would be expedient to carry back Mrs  Cowslip  and lodge her at the place where Mr  Clump had promised to visit her with intelligence  for  in all probability  it was not for want of inclination that he had not kept his promise   Dolly did not express any aversion to the scheme of returning to London  where she hoped once more to rejoin her dear lady  to whom by this time she was attached by the strongest ties of affection  and her inclination in this respect was assisted by the consideration of having the company of the young lawyer  who  it plainly appeared  had made strange havoc in her heart  though it must be owned  for the honour of this blooming damsel  that her thoughts had never once deviated from the paths of innocence and virtue  The more Sir Launcelot surveyed this agreeable maiden  the more he felt himself disposed to take care of her fortune  and from this day he began to ruminate on a scheme which was afterwards consummated in her favour  In the meantime he laid injunctions on Mr  Clarke to conduct his addresses to Mrs  Cowslip according to the rules of honour and decorum  as he valued his countenance and friendship  His next step was to procure a saddle horse for Dolly  who preferred this to any other sort of carriage  and thereby gratified the wish of her admirer  who longed to see her on horseback in her green joseph   The armour  including the accoutrements of the novice and the squire  were left in the care of the inn keeper  and Timothy Crabshaw was so metamorphosed by a plain livery frock  that even Gilbert with difficulty recognised his person  As for the novice Crowe  his head had almost resumed its natural dimensions  but then his whole face was so covered with a livid suffusion  his nose appeared so flat  and his lips so tumefied  that he might very well have passed for a Caffre or Ethiopian  Every circumstance being now adjusted  they departed from Bugden in a regular cavalcade  dined at Hatfield  and in the evening arrived at the Bull and Gate Inn in Holborn  where they established their quarters for the night             CHAPTER TWENTY  IN WHICH OUR HERO DESCENDS INTO THE MANSION OF THE DAMNED   The first step which Sir Launcelot took in the morning that succeeded his arrival in London was to settle Mrs  Dolly Cowslip in lodgings at the house where John Clump had promised to visit her  as he did not doubt  that  though the visit was delayed  it would some time or other be performed  and in that case he might obtain some intelligence of Aurelia  Mr  Thomas Clarke was permitted to take up his habitation in the same house  on his earnestly desiring he might be intrusted with the office of conveying information and instruction between Dolly and our adventurer  The knight himself resolved to live retired  until he should receive some tidings relating to Miss Darnel that should influence his conduct  but he proposed to frequent places of public resort incognito  that he might have some chance of meeting by accident with the mistress of his heart   Taking it for granted  that the oddities of Crowe would help to amuse him in his hours of solitude and disappointment  he invited that original to be his guest at a small house  which he determined to hire ready furnished  in the neighbourhood of Golden Square  The captain thanked him for his courtesy  and frankly embraced his offer  though he did not much approve of the knight s choice in point of situation  He said he would recommend him to a special good upper deck hard by St  Catherine s in Wapping  where he would be delighted with the prospect of the street forwards  well frequented by passengers  carts  drays  and other carriages  and having backwards an agreeable view of Alderman Parson s great brewhouse  with two hundred hogs feeding almost under the window  As a further inducement  he mentioned the vicinity of the Tower guns  which would regale his hearing on days of salutation
