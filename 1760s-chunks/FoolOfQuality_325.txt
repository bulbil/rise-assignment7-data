  till the following day was far advanced  At length I perceived   that I still existed      I dreamed that I found myself in a deep and noisome dungeon      It is observable that  within ten years subsequent to the period of the above promise    the inland navigation of England commenced  Since which time  the river Isis has   been made navigable from Oxford to Cricklade in Wiltshire  and to Abingdon in   Berkshire  The river Avon in Warwickshire  from Stratford to the Severn  The Avon   from Bath to Bristol  The Medway  from Maidstone in Kent to Tunbridge  The Lug   in Herefordshire  to the Wey  The Lea  from Ware to the Thames  The river Kennet   in Berkshire  to the Thames at Reading  containing twenty locks in seventeen miles    The river Aire in Yorkshire containing sixteen locks  whose tolls are now valued at about   10 0 10 yearly  Beside the Stroud  the Nen  and the Wey  with many others now in         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  357     without a single ray that might even suffice to show me the horrors   of my situation  I attempted to rise and grope about  but per    ceived that I was tied and fastened down to earth by a number   and variety of bands and fetters      At length a sudden light appeared  and diffused itself throughout   the darkness of my mansion   when  looking up  I observed that   the keeper of my prison had entered  the doors being yet locked    His head  as I thought  was bound about with a tiara  from whence   the glory arose that shone around me  In the coronet  instead   of gems  were inserted a number of thorns  whose points streamed   with incessant and insufferable brightness  and on the golden   circlet was engraved in all languages  Jesus of Nazareth  King   of the Jews      Immediately my shackles loosened and fell away of themselves    and I wished to cast my whole existence under the feet of my   Lord  but was so overcome with ecstasy that I could not rise     when  looking upon me with a smile of ineffable graciousness  he   approached and took me by the hand  and at the contact I sprung   up a great height in my bed  and awoke to sensations of inde    scribable blessedness      You are come  then  my Lord  my salvation   you are come  my   Master  I cried  and I will cling inseparably to you  Never  O   never more will I suffer you to depart   Ah  I have felt  severely felt    what it is to be without you   for in your absence  though but for   a moment  lies the essence of hell and misery  but in your pre    sence  my beloved  in your presence is peace unspeakable  and   joy for evermore       From that day my nature became  as it were  wholly inverted    All the honours and wordly respects for which I formerly risked   my life  were now my aversion   and I turned from carnal in    dulgence and sensuality with loathing      Nothing could now affront  nothing could now offend me  As   I totally despised myself  so I wished  after the process of my   divine Master  to be despised and rejected of men  This made   all others  the very meanest of human creatures  respectable unto   me  Even in reprobates methought I discerned some unerased   traces of the image and superscription of my God  and I bowed   down before it      If any attempted to injure or defraud me of my property  I   yielded it without variance  and thereby I found myself cordially   enriched      I grew weary of my own will and of my own liberty  and I   earnestly prayed my Lord that he would rid me of them  and be   instead thereof a controlling principle within me  ever influencing   and directing me according to his own pleasure  Turn me  Jesus    Master  turn me  I crie  I  from all the evil propensities of my   own evil nature   though thou shouldst turn me  as thou didst   Sennacherib  with thy ruling rein on my neck  thy bridle in my   mouth  and thy hook in my nose   Take my heart and affections   captive  and into thine own divine guidance   Compel me into all   the ways and all the works of thy commandments  till thy yoke   shall become easy  and thy burden light and delightsome  till I         358 THE
