and roused him with a hilloah  that might have been heard at the distance of half a league  Dawdle  startled by this terrific sound  sprung out of bed  and stood upright on the floor  before he opened his eyes upon the object by which he had been so dreadfully alarmed  But when he beheld the head of Crowe  so swelled and swathed  so livid  hideous  and grisly  with a broadsword by his side  and a case of pistols in his girdle  he believed it was the apparition of some murdered man  his hair bristled up  his teeth chattered  and his knees knocked  he would have prayed  but his tongue denied its office  Crowe seeing his perturbation   Mayhap  friend   said he   you take me for a buccaneer  but I am no such person  —My name is Captain Crowe —I come not for your silver nor your gold  your rigging nor your stowage  but hearing as how your friend intends to bring my friend Sir Launcelot Greaves to action  d ye see  I desire in the way of friendship  that  while they are engaged  you and I  as their seconds  may lie board and board for a few glasses to divert one another  d ye see   Dawdle hearing this request  began to retrieve his faculties  and throwing himself into the attitude of Hamlet when the ghost appears  exclaimed in theatrical accent        Angels and ministers of grace defend us        Art thou a spirit of grace  or goblin damn d   As he seemed to bend his eye on vacancy  the captain began to think that he really saw something preternatural  and stared wildly round  Then addressing himself to the terrified Dawdle   D—n d   said he   for what should I be d—n d  If you are afeard of goblins  brother  put your trust in the Lord  and he ll prove a sheet anchor to you   The other having by this time recollected himself perfectly  continued notwithstanding to spout tragedy  and  in the words of Macbeth  pronounced        What man dare  I dare        Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear        The arm d rhinoceros  or Hyrcanian tiger        Take any shape but that  and my firm nerves       Shall never tremble     Ware names  Jack   cried the impatient mariner   if so be as how you ll bear a hand and rig yourself  and take a short trip with me into the offing  we ll overhaul this here affair in the turning of a capstan    At this juncture they were joined by Mr  Sycamore in his night gown and slippers  Disturbed by Crowe s first salute  he sprung up  and now expressed no small astonishment at first sight of the novice s countenance  After having gazed alternately at him and Dawdle   Who have we got here   said he   raw head and bloody bones   When his friend  slipping on his clothes  gave him to understand that this was a friend of Sir Launcelot Greaves  and explained the purport of his errand  he treated him with more civility  He assured him that he should have the pleasure to break a spear with Mr  Dawdle  and signified his surprise that Sir Launcelot had made no answer to his letter  It being by this time clear daylight  and Crowe extremely interested in this affair  he broke without ceremony into the knight s chamber  and told him abruptly that the enemy had brought to  and waited for his coming up  in order to begin the action   I ve hailed his consort   said he   a shambling  chattering fellow  He took me first for a hobgoblin  then called me names  a tiger  a wrynoseo ross  and a Persian bear  but egad  if I come athwart him  I ll make him look like the bear and ragged staff before we part —I wool    This intimation was not received with that alacrity which the captain expected to find in our adventurer  who told him in a peremptory tone  that he had no design to come to action  and desired to be left to his repose  Crowe forthwith retired crestfallen  and muttered something  which was never distinctly heard   About eight in the morning Mr  Dawdle brought him a formal message from the knight of the Griffin  desiring he would appoint the lists  and give security of the field  To which request he made answer in a very composed and solemn accent   If the person who sent you thinks I have injured him  let him without disguise or any such ridiculous ceremony  explain the nature of the wrong  and then I shall give such satisfaction as may suit my conscience and my character  If he hath bestowed his affection upon any particular object  and looks upon me as a favourite rival  I shall not wrong the lady so much as to take any step that may prejudice her choice  especially a step that contradicts my own
