fortune in his own disposal  with a view of preserving his independance    310 and the power of punishing me  in case I should not make a good use of what he had already bestowed upon me   Without troubling the reader with an account of the effect which this surprizing generosity had upon my mind  I shall only say  that his promises were instantly performed  and an invoyce of merchandize proper for the voyage presented to me  that I might purchase the goods  and ship them with all expedition —In the midst of this hurry the remembrance of my charming Narcissa often interposed  and made me the most miserable of all mortals  I was distracted with the thought of being torn from her  perhaps  for ever  and though the hope of seeing her again  might have supported me under the torments of separation  I could not reflect upon the anguish she must feel at parting with me  and the incessant sorrows to which her tender bosom would be exposed daring my absence  without being pierced with the deepest affliction  As an imagination was daily and nightly upon the rack to invent some method of mitigating this cruel stroke  or at least of acquitting my love and honour in the opinion of that gentle creature  I at length stumbled upon an expedient  with which the reader will be made acquainted in due time  and in consequence of my determination  became less uneasy and disturbed   My business being finished  and the ship ready to sail  I resolved to make my last appearance among my acquaintance at the other end of the town  where I had not been seen since my imprisonment  and as I had  by the advice of my uncle  taken off some very rich cloaths for sale  I put on the gayest suit in my possession  and went in a chair to the coffee house I used to frequent    311 where I found my friend Banter so confounded at the magnificence of my dress  that when I made up to him  he gazed at me with a look of astonishment  without being able  for some minutes  to open his lips —then pulling me aside by the sleeve  and fixing his eyes on mine  accosted me in this manner     Random  where the devil have you been  eh —What is the meaning of all this finery —Oho  I understand you—You are just arrived from the country  what  the roads are good  eh —well  Random  you are a bold fellow  and a lucky fellow —but take care  the pitcher goes often to the well  but is broke at last    So saying  he pointed to his collar  by which gesture  and the broken hints he had ejaculated  I found he suspected me of having robbed on the highway  and I laughed very heartily at his supposition —Without explaining myself any farther  I told him he was mistaken in his conjecture  that I had been for some time past with the relation of whom he had frequently heard me speak  and that being to set out next day upon my travels  I had come thither to take my leave of my friends  and to receive of him the money he had borrowed from me  which  now that I was going abroad  I should have occasion for—He was a little disconcerted at this demand  but recollecting himself in a moment  swore  in an affected passion  that I had used him extremely ill  and he would never forgive me  for having  by this short warning  put it out of his power to free himself of an obligation he could no longer bear —I could not help smiling at this pretended delicacy  which I commended highly  telling him  he needed not be uneasy on that score  for I would give him a cirection to a merchant   312 in the city  with whom I would leave a discharge for the sum  to be delivered upon payment —He professed much joy at this expedient  and with great eagerness asked the person s name and place of abode  which he forthwith wrote in his pocket book  assuring me  that he would not be long in my debt —This affair  which I knew he would never after think of  being settled to his satisfaction  I sent cards to all my friends  desiring the savour of their company at a tavern in the evening  when they honoured my invitation  and I had the pleasure of treating them in a very elegant manner  at which they expressed as much admiration as applause  Having enjoyed ourselves till midnight  I took my leave of them all  being well nigh stifled with caresses  and next day I set out with Strap in a post chaise for Gravesend  where we went on board  and the wind serving  weighed anchor in less than twelve hours —Without meeting with any accident  we got as far as the Downs  where we were obliged to come to an anchor  and wait for an easterly wind to carry us out of the Channel       313  CHAP  LXV    I set out for Sussex—consult Mrs  Sagely—atchieve an interview with Narcissa—return to the ship—we get clear of the Channel—I learn our destination—we are chaced by a large ship—the company are dismayed  and encouraged by
