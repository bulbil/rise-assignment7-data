These were great trusts  but  what rendered him still more powerful  he either thought himself a saint  or affected to be thought so  he wore sackcloth next his skin  and his equi and diet were mean and simple  So much power  pride  and seeming humility  united  were formidable  and such Henry found them   The King proposed  in a council of the nobles  that the Bishops should not be permitted to go to Rome  that no subject should appeal to the Holy See  that no officer of the crown should be ex communicated  or suspended  without the Sovereign s permission  and lastly  which was the great article he aimed at  that the clergy should be subject to the temporal judges  as well as the rest of his subjects  Such just propositions were agreed upon by all present  even Becket hesitated not to sign his name  they were referred next to the Pope  for his approbation  the Pope disapproved of them all  Upon this  therefore  Becket declared his repentance  for having complied with the King in signing the Constitutions of Clarendon  as they were called  and  in order to carry on the farce  suspended himself  as unworthy to perform his functions till the Pope should be pleased to absolve him   This pardon he quickly obtained  and now he set no bounds to his obstinacy and ambition  Some historians describe Becket as a saint  and some as a designing hypocrite  neither are  probably  just   82 in their opinions  He pursued  with inflexibility  what was in fact wrong  but what education  and the manners of the times  had taught him to believe was right  his errors were rather of judgment than of will  the world abounds with men who are erroneous  there are but few villains   The King was resolved to humble a man himself  who had  by his own authority  been lifted into power  and accused him of embezzling the public money  while Chancellor  While the judges were consulting  Becket insolently entered the council  with a crosier in his hand  to intimidate his judges  but  notwithstanding this boldness  he was condemned as a traitor  although he found means of avoiding punishment  by escaping into Flanders   The Popes had long been growing formidable to the Kings of England  Alexander III  immediately espoused Becket s quarrel  and brought the King to consent to a conference  which came to nothing  another succeeded  but with as little success  a third was proposed  and accepted  The King  wearied out with the repeated threats of the Pope  and the excommunications of his clergy  consented to almost every thing the haughty prelate demanded  But when all the articles were settled  and Becket was to give the King the kiss of peace  he took it into his head to say  that it was for God s honour  the King insisted that this expression should be retracted  Becket insisted upon using it  this renewed the debate  and the conference ended once more without effect   At length  however  after an interval of some years  they were reconciled  and the Archbishop made his entry into London  amidst the acclamations of the populace  His pride was now increased   83 by success  and he went from town to town in a sort of triumphal cavalcade  But he was scarcely re instated in his power  when he began to exert it to its utmost extent  he solemnly excommunicated two lords who had opposed him  and published the Pope s letters  for the suspension of several bishops who had shewn themselves his enemies  The King  who was in Normandy  soon received information of this prelate s pride and popularity  and soon after the suspended Bishops came over to lay before him their complaints  throwing themselves at his feet  they implored his protection  and inveighed against their oppressor  Henry was now quite exasperated by their complaints  and continually uneasy from the repeated instances of Becket s insolence  was heard to say    Is there none to revenge their Monarch s cause upon this audacious priest   These words seemed to arm the most resolute of his attendants  and four knights  whose names were Hugh Norvil  William Tracy  Hugh Brito  and Richard Fitzurse  hastened to Canterbury  and  entering the cathedral  where Becket was officiating  with a few attendants  they beat out his brains  with clubs  at the foot of the altar     His death confirmed those privileges to the clergy  which his opposition could not do  His resolution  during life  and his resignation  when dying  gained the hearts of the people  He was looked upon as a martyr  and the clergy took care to confirm his sanctity by miracles  When the people are resolved to see miracles  they are seldom disappointed  it was not sufficient that his shrine had a power of restoring dead men to life  it restored also cows  dogs  and horses  It was reported  and believed  that he rose from his coffin   84 before he was buried  to light the tapers designed for his funeral  and  when the funeral ceremony was over  that he stretched forth his
