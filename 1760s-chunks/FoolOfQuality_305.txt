could ever have been duly known known to be the   God of love to be nothing but love  in this his wonderful work   of mercy  transcending mercy   and of grace  transcending grace    that he might bring us to glory transcending glory      In this stupendous work of redemption  I say Jesus makes   himself as it were little  that we may become great   he stoops into   manhood  that he may exalt us into God  He came not arrayed   in the fool s coat of the lustre of this despicable world  nor in the   weakness of its power  nor in the meanness of its dignity   but over   his immensity he threw the appearance of limitation  and with   time he invested his eternity   and his omnipotence put on frailty     and his supremacy put on subjection   and with the veil of mortality   he shrouded his beauty  that he might become familiar to us  that   we might behold and converse with him face to face  as man con    verses with man  and grows fond of his fellow      Before the incarnation  God was feared in his thunders  and   adored in the majesty and magnificence of his works  But it is in   the meek and lowly Jesus that he becomes the object of affection     in the bleeding  the suffering  the dying Jesus  we behold him   with weeping gratitude  we love him with a love of passion and   burning  a love that languishes for him  that cannot bear to exist   without him      How could that perverse people shut their eyes to the divinity   of their gracious Messiah  while he gave such hourly and ocular   proofs of the power and extent of his godhead in and over all   things  while he went about doing good  carrying healing in his   breath  in his touch  in his garments   while the lame sprung up   as a bounding roe at his bidding   while the tempest heard his   voice and was still  and the sea spread itself as a carpet beneath   the foot of its creator   while the deaf ear was opened  and the   dumb tongue loosed to utterance  while he poured the beams   of his light upon the new opening eyes of the blind born gazer     and while in death  and amidst the tombs  his word was life and   resurrection           THE FOOL OF QUALITY  333     Thus  my Harry  you find yourself united to your Saviour by   many endearing and intimate connections  by creation  by redemp    tion  by brotherhood  by fatherhood in the flesh  in the spirit   by   his being bone of your bone  and spirit of your spirit   by being   the   first born of many brethren   and by being the divine father   of a new and celestial progeny      But what need we further  the world from the beginning is   fraught with him  and speaks of him  The world is  in itself  no   other than a history of the two capital and eternally important   truths the greatness of the fall in Lucifer and Adam  and the   greatness of the redemption in Jesus Christ  These truths are   engraven in the rocks as deep as the centre   they are written on   both sides of every leaf in nature  All that is within us  all that   is without us  utters forth the same language  proclaims the same   tidings aloud  All ceremonials  all institutions of divine authority    all ancient predictions and prophecies  were pregnant with  and in   travail of the great deliverance to be achieved by the Shiloh who   was to come  They give us a previous history of his whole process   upon earth  from his birth to his resurrection  as circumstantially    as minutely as though it were a bare transcript of what had   recently passed before their eyes  But I shall only dwell a minute   on three principal articles first  that Messiah was to be God     secondly  that he was  however  to be a suffering Messiah  and   thirdly  that he was to give himself to death for the salvation   of sinners      First  With respect to his divinity  Daniel says   I saw in the   night visions  and  behold  one like unto the Son of Man came with   the clouds of heaven  and came to the Ancient of Days  and   they brought him near before him  And there was given him   dominion  and glory  and a kingdom  that all people  nations  and   languages should serve him  his dominion is an everlasting do
