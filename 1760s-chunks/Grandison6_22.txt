answerable to my fortune  altho   in the common methods of calculation  it may exceed that of the dear Lady That you may be the better judge of this  you will find a brief particular of my Irish Estate  subjoined to the other   I was intending  when I received yours  to do myself the honour of a visit to Selby house  I am impatient to throw myself at the feet of my dear Miss Byron  and to commend myself to the favour of Mr  and Mrs  Selby  and every one of a family I am prepared by their characters  as well as by their relation to Miss Byron  to revere and love  But as you seem to choose that the requisite preliminaries should be first adjusted by pen and ink  I submit  tho  with reluctance  to that course  but with the less  as I may  in the interim  receive Letters from abroad  which  tho  they can now make no alteration with regard to the treaty so happily begun  may give me an opportunity of laying the whole state of my affairs before Miss Byron  by which means she will be enabled to form a judgment of them  and of the heart of  dear Sir   Her and your most affectionate  obliged  and faithful humble Servant  CH  GRANDISON     55  LETTER XV  Miss BYRON  To Lady G     With the two preceding Letters    Selby house  Sat  Oct  7   WELL did you observe  my dear that we may be very differently affected by the same event  when judged of at a distance  and near  May I  in the present situation  presume to say near  Mr  Deane has entered into the particulars of my fortune with Sir Charles  The Letter was not shewn me before it went  and I was not permitted to see the copy of it till your brother s answer came  and then they shewed me both   O my dear Mr  Deane  my ever kind uncle and aunt Selby  Was not your Harriet Byron too much obliged to you before —As to your brother  What  my love  shall I do with my pride  I did not know I had so much of that bad quality  My poverty  my dear  has added to my pride  Were my fortune superior to that of your brother  I am sure I should not be so proud as I now  on this occasion  find I am  How generously does he decline accepting the goodness that was offered to give me more consideration with him  as kindly intended by them   What can I say to him  but that his heart  still prouder than my own  and more generous than that of any other person breathing  will not permit me to owe uncommon obligations to any but himself   He desires that I may not know any thing of this transaction  But they thought the communication would give me pleasure  However  they wish me not to take notice to him  when he visits Selby house  that they have communicated it to me  If I did  I should think myself obliged to manifest a gratitude that would embarrass me  in my present situation  and   56 seem to fetter the freedom of my will  Millions of obligations should not bribe me to give up even a corner of my heart  to a man to whom I could not give the whole  Your brother  my dear  is in possession of the whole   You know that I hate affectation  But must I not have great abatements in my prospects of happiness  because of Lady Clementina  And must they not be still greater  should she be unhappy  should she repent of the resolution she so nobly took  for his saying  that whatever be the contents of his next Letters from Italy  they can make no alteration with regard to the treaty begun with us —Dear  dear Clementina  most excellent of women  Can I bear to stand in the way of your happiness —I cannot—My life  any more than yours  may not be a long one  and I will not fully the whiteness of it  Pardon my vanity  I presume to call it so  on retrospecting it  regarding my intentions only  by giving way to an act of injustice  tho  it were to obtain for me the whole heart of the man I love   Yet think you  my dear  that I am not mortified     How can I look round upon my congratulating friends  in one of the most solemn events of my life  with that modest confidence which the sense of laying an obligation on a favoured object    You know in whose generous words I express myself    gives to diffident merit    O my Charlotte  I am afraid of your brother  How shall I look up to him  when I next see him —But I will give way to this new guest  my pride  What other way have I —Will you forgive me  if I try to look upon your brother s generosity to me and my friends  in declining so greatly their offers  as a bribe to make me
