suffered himself quietly to be undressed and put to  bed  where the fatigue occasioned by his exercise at the masquerade  co operated with the present dissipation of his spirits to lull him  into a profound sleep  which greatly tended to the preservation of his  intellects  Not that he found himself in a state of perfect tranquility    6 22 15  3 45 PM   when he waked about noon  The remembrance of what had passed overwhelmed  him with mortification  Emilia s invectives still sounded in his ears   And  while he deeply resented her disdain  he could not help admiring  her spirit  and his heart did homage to her charms   CHAPTER LXXVII   He endeavours to Reconcile himself to his Mistress  and Expostulates  with the Uncle  who forbids him the House   In this state of division  he went home to his own lodgings in a chair   and while he deliberated with himself whether he should relinquish  the pursuit  and endeavour to banish her idea from his breast  or go  immediately and humble himself before his exasperated mistress  and  offer his hand as an atonement for his crime  his servant put in his  hand a packet  which had been delivered by a ticket porter at the  door  He no sooner perceived that the superscription was in Emilia s  handwriting  than he guessed the nature of the contents  and  opening  the seal with disordered eagerness  found the jewels he had given to her  enclosed in a billet  couched in these words           That I may have no cause to reproach myself with having       retained the least memorial of a wretch whom I equally       despise and abhor  I take this opportunity of restoring       these ineffectual instruments of his infamous design upon       the honour of   Emilia     His chagrin was so much galled and inflamed at the bitterness of this  contemptuous message  that he gnawed his fingers till the blood ran  over his nails  and even wept with vexation  Sometimes he vowed revenge  against her haughty virtue  and reviled himself for his precipitate  declaration  before his scheme was brought to maturity  then he would  consider her behaviour with reverence and regard  and bow before the  irresistible power of her attractions  In short  his breast was torn by  conflicting passions  love  shame  and remorse  contended with vanity   ambition  and revenge  and the superiority was still doubtful when  headstrong desire interposed  and decided in favour of an attempt  towards a reconciliation with the offended fair   Impelled by this motive  he set out in the afternoon for the house of  her uncle  not without hopes of that tender enjoyment  which never fails  to attend an accommodation betwixt two lovers of taste and sensibility   Though the consciousness of his trespass encumbered him with an air of  awkward confusion  he was too confident of his own qualifications and  address to despair of forgiveness  and  by that time he arrived at the  citizen s gate  he had conned a very artful and pathetic harangue  which  he proposed to utter in his own behalf  laying the blame of his conduct  on the impetuosity of his passion  increased by the burgundy which he  had too liberally drunk  but he did not meet with an opportunity to  avail himself of this preparation  Emilia  suspecting that he would    6 22 15  3 45 PM   take some step of this kind to retrieve her favour  had gone abroad  on pretence of visiting  after having signified to her kinsman her  resolution to avoid the company of Peregrine  on account of some  ambiguities which  she said  were last night remarkable in his demeanour  at the masquerade  She chose to insinuate her suspicion in these hints   rather than give an explicit detail of the young man s dishonourable  contrivance  which might have kindled the resentment of the family to  some dangerous pitch of animosity and revenge   Our adventurer  finding himself baffled in his expectation of seeing  her  inquired for the old gentleman  with whom he thought he had  influence enough to make his apology good  in case he should find  him prepossessed by the young lady s information  But here too he was  disappointed  the uncle having gone to dine in the country  and his wife  was indisposed  so that he had no pretext for staying in the house till  the return of his charmer  Being  however  fruitful of expedients  he  dismissed his chariot  and took possession of a room in a tavern  the  windows of which fronted the merchant s gate  and there he proposed to  watch until he should see her approach  This scheme he put in practice  with indefatigable patience  though it was not attended with the  expected success   Emilia  whose caution was equally vigilant and commendable  foreseeing  that she might be exposed to the fertility of his invention  came home  by a private passage
