of that house where he had taken refuge   and  being sufficiently   apprised of what he wanted to know  he walked toward Mr    Fenton s  hastening his pace with the spirit and expectation of   revenge      Mr  Fenton had arrived but a little before  and  desiring to know   Mr  Snarle s commands  he was informed  in terms the most aggra    vating and inveterate  of the whole course and history of Ned s   misbehaviour  The delinquent thereupon was called up to instant   trial  He honestly confessed the facts  but pleaded  in mitigation    the beating that Mr  Snarle had already given him  but as Mr    Fenton did not judge this sufficient to reform the natural petulance   of a disposition that otherwise was not void of merit  a rod was         140 TEE FOOL OF QUALITY      immediately brought  and Andrew was ordered to horse  and Frank   to flog the criminal in presence of the party aggrieved      During this operation  Mr  Snarle observed that Frank s hand did   not altogether answer to the benevolence of his own heart   where    upon he furiously snatched the rod from him  and began to lay at   Ned with might and main  Hereat Mr  Fenton ordered Andrew   to let the boy down  and  observing that he would no further in    terfere in a cause where the appellant assumed judgment and execu    tion to himself  he carelessly turned his back upon Mr  Snarle  and   left him to cool his passions by his evening s walk homeward      Poor Ned was more afraid of Mr  Fenton s displeasure than he   would have been of a full brother to the whipping he had got    But Mr  Fenton was too generous to add the severity of his own   countenance to the weight of Frank s hand  and Ned was quickly   reinstated in the good graces of the family     His genius  however  returned with an involuntary bent toward   obtaining satisfaction for the injuries he had received from Mr    Snarle  provided he might retaliate without fear of detection   and   he was not slow in contriving very adequate means      There was a villager in Hampstead  about ten years of age  who   had conceived an uncommon kindness for Ned on account of his   sprig htliness  his wit  and good humour  To this condoling  friend   he had imparted his grievances   and on him alone he depended for   execution of the project proposed for redress      On a certain moonless night they mustered four tame cats  and   having bound some fuse round three or four inches of the ex    tremity of each of their tails  they lodged them together in a bag     and somewhat after supper time  when all the town was silent    they marched softly and cautiously to the house of Mr  Snarle    There Ned s friend with his knife dexterously picked away the   putty from a pane of the window of a side chamber  where no light   appeared   and having put fire to the fuse of each tail successively    they slipped their cats one by one in at the window  and again   having pegged the pane into its place  they withdrew to a little   distance to watch the issue      The poor cats remained silent  and universally inoffensive  while   they felt no damage  But as soon as the fire had seized on   their tails  they began to speak to you in a language wholly   peculiar  as one would think  to sentiments and sounds of diabolical   intention      Mr  and Mrs  Snarle had been jangling over the fire in an   opposite parlour  when their dispute was suddenly settled by this   outcry  as they imagined  of a legion of infernals  They instantly   started up  and cast a countenance of pale and contagious panic at   each other  But George  the footman  a strong and bold fellow    having just before entered on some business to his master  turned   and run to the chamber from whence the peal came  He threw   open the door with his wonted intrepidity  but this was as far   as mortal courage could go  for the cats spying a passage whereby    as they conceived  they might fly from their pain  rushed sud    denly and jointly on the face and breast of George  and back he   fell with a cry of terror and desperation  On however went the         TEE FOOL OF QUALITY          141         cats  and  flying into the parlour
