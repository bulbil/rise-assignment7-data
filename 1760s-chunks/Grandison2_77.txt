 or to those I love  when I forget  or depart from  the duty owing to the most indulgent of fathers  by  His CHARLES GRANDISON   WHAT an excellent young man is this —But observe  Lucy  he says he will on his return to England unbosom his whole heart to his father  and till then  he desires him to discontinue the begun treaty with Lord N —Ah  my dear —What has any new acquaintance to expect  were she to be intangled in a hopeless  191passion  But let us consider—Had Sir Charles been actually married  would his being so  have enabled a woman s reason to triumph over her passion —If so  passion is surely conquerable  And did I know any body that wou d allow it to be so in the one case  and not in the other  I would bid her take shame to herself  and  with deep humiliation  mourn her ungovernable folly   The above Letter came not to the hands of the young Ladies till after their father s death  which happen d within a month of his receiving it  and before he had actually given permission for the young gentleman s return  You may suppose they were excessively affected with the bad impressions their father had sought to make in their brother s heart  of their conduct  and when he died  were the more apprehensive of their force   He had suspended the treaty of marriage for his son till the young gentleman should arrive  He had perplexed himself about his private affairs  which  by long neglect  became very intricate  and of consequence must be very irksome for such a man to look into  He was resolved therefore to leave it to each steward  having persuaded himself  against appearances  to have a good opinion of both  to examine the accounts of the other  not only as this would give the least trouble to himself  but as they had several items to charge  which he had no mind should be explained to his son  Nor were those gentlemen less solicitous to obtain discharges from him  for being apprised of his reason for looking into his affairs  they were afraid of the inspection of so good a manager as their young master was known to be   Mr  Filmer  the steward for the Irish estate  came over  on this occasion  with his accounts  The two stewards acted in concert  and on the report of each  Sir Thomas examined totals only  and order d releases to be drawn for his signing     192 What a degrader even of high spirits  is vice  What meanness was there in Sir Thomas s pride  To be afraid of the eye of a son  of whose duty he was always boasting   But who shall answer for the resormation of an habitual libertine  when a temptation offers  Observe what followed   Mr  Filmer  knowing Sir Thomas s frailty  had brought over with him  and with a view to ensnare the unhappy man  a fine young creature  not more than sixteen  on pretence of visiting her aunt who lived in Pallmall  and who was a relation of his wife  She was innocent of actual crime  But her parents had no virtue  and had not made it a part of the young woman s education  but had  on the contrar•  brought her up with a notion that her beauty would make her fortune  and she knew it was all the fortune they had to give her   Mr  Filmer  in his attendances on Sir Thomas  was always praising the beauty of Miss Obrian  her genteel descent  as well as figure  her innocence  Innocence  the Attractive equally to the attempts of Rakes and Devils   But the Baronet  intent upon pursuing his better schemes  for some time  only gave the artful man the hearing  At last  however  for curiositysake  he was prevailed upon to make the aunt a visit  The niece was not absent  She more than answered all that Filmer had said in her praise  as to the beauty of her person  Sir Thomas repeated his visits  The girl was well tutored  behaved with prudence  with reserve rather  and  in short  made such an impression on his heart  that he declared to Filmer that he could not live without her   Advantage was endeavoured to be taken of his insatuation  He offered high terms  But for some time the aunt insisted upon his marrying her niece   Sir Thomas had been too long a leader in the free world  to be so taken in  as it is called  But at last  a   193 proposal was made him  from no part of which  the aunt declared she would recede  tho  the poor girl   who  it was pretended  loved him above all the men she had ever seen  were to break her heart for him  A fine piece of flattery  Lucy  to a man who numbered near three times her years  and who was still fond of making conquests   The terms were  That he should settle upon the young woman 500 l  a year for her life  and on her father and mother  if they could be brought to consent
