relate particulars  I quickened my pace  and took possession of  a hackney coach  in which I proceeded to the vehicle I had appointed to  be in waiting     6 22 15  3 45 PM    While I thus compassed my escape  there was nothing but perplexity and  confusion at home  dinner was delayed till six o clock  my lord ran half  the town over in quest of his equipage  which at last returned  with  an account of my elopement  My maid was brought to the question  and  grievously threatened  but  like all the women I ever had  remained  unshaken in her fidelity  In the meantime  I travelled night and day  towards my retreat in Lincolnshire  of which his lordship had not   as yet  got the least intelligence  and as my coachman was but an  inexperienced driver  I was obliged to make use of my own skill in that  exercise  and direct his endeavours the whole way  without venturing to  go to bed  or take the least repose  until I reached my own habitation   There I lived in peace and tranquility for the space of six weeks   when I was alarmed by one of my lord s myrmidons  who came into the  neighbourhood  blustering and swearing that he would carry me off either  dead or alive    It is not to be supposed that I was perfectly easy when I was made  acquainted with his purpose and declaration  as my whole family  consisted of no more than a couple of women and one footman  However  I  summoned up my courage  which had been often tried  and never forsook me  in the day of danger  and sent him word  that  if ever he should presume  to approach my house  I would order him to be shot without ceremony   The fellow did not choose to put me to the trial  and returned to town  without his errand  but as the place of my abode was now discovered   I laid my account with having a visit from his employer  I therefore  planted spies upon the road  with a promise of reward to him who should  bring me the first intelligence of his lordship s approach    Accordingly  I was one morning apprised of his coming  and  mounting  horse immediately  with my woman and valet  away we rode  in defiance of  winter  In two days I traversed the wilds of Lincolnshire and hundreds  of Essex  crossed the river at Tilbury  breakfasted at Chatham  by  the help of a guide and moonlight arrived at Dover the same evening   embarked for Calais  in which place I found myself next day at two  o clock in the afternoon  and being heartily tired with my journey   betook myself to rest  My maid  who was not able to travel with such  expedition  followed me at an easier pace  and the footman was so  astonished at my perseverance  that he could not help asking me upon  the road  if ever I was weary in my life  Certain it is  my spirits  and resolution have enabled me to undergo fatigues that are almost  incredible  From Calais I went to Brussels  where I again set up my  rest in private lodgings  was again perfectly well received by the  fashionable people of that place  and  by the interest of my friends   obtained the queen of Hungary s protection against the persecution of  my husband  while I should reside in the Austrian Netherlands  Thus  secured  I lived uncensured  conversing with the English company  with  which this city was crowded  but spent the most agreeable part of my  time with the countess of Calemberg  in whose house I generally dined  and supped  And I also contracted an intimacy with the princess of  Chemay  who was a great favourite with Madame d Harrach  the governor s  lady    I had not been long in this happy situation  when I was disturbed by  the arrival of Lord     who demanded me of the governor  but finding me  sheltered from his power  he set out for Vienna  and  in consequence  of his representations  strengthened with the duke of N   s name  my  protection was withdrawn  But  before this application  he had gone to    6 22 15  3 45 PM   the camp  and addressed himself to my Lord Stair  who was my particular  friend and ally by my first marriage  desiring he would compel me to  return to his house  His lordship told him  that I was in no shape  subject to his command  but invited him to dinner  with a view of  diverting himself and company at the expense of his guest  In the  evening  he was plied with so many bumpers to my health  that he became  intoxicated  and extremely obstreperous  insisted upon seeing Lord Stair  after he was retired to rest  and quarrelled with Lord D    who being  a tall  large  raw boned Scotchman
