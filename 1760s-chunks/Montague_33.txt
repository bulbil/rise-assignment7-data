without reducing her to indigence at home  or dooming her to be an exile in Canada for life  I dare not ask myself what I wish or intend  yet I give way in spite of me to the delight of seeing and conversing with her       I must not look forward  I will only enjoy the present pleasure of believing myself one of the first in her esteem and friendship  and of shewing her all those little pleasing attentions so dear to a sensible heart  attentions in which her lover is astonishingly remiss  he is at Montreal  and I am told was gay and happy on his journey thither  though he left his mistress behind       I have spent two very happy days at Silleri  with Emily and your friend Bell Fermor  to morrow I meet them at the governor s  where there is a very agreable assembly on Thursday evenings  Adieu   Yours   ED  RIVERS       I shall write again by a ship which sails next week     LETTER XXXIX   39   To JOHN TEMPLE  Esq  Pall Mall   Quebec  Oct  18   I HAVE this moment a letter from Madame Des Roches  the lady at whose house I spent a week  and to whom I am greatly obliged  I am so happy as to have an opportunity of rendering her a service  in which I must desire your assistance         Tis in regard to some lands belonging to her  which  not being settled  some other person has applied for a grant of at home  I send you the particulars  and beg you will lose no time in entering a caveat  and taking other proper steps to prevent what would be an act of great injustice  the war and the incursions of the Indians in alliance with us have hitherto prevented these lands from being settled  but Madame Des Roches is actually in treaty with some Acadians to settle them immediately  Employ all your friends as well as mine if necessary  my lawyer will direct you in what manner to apply  and pay the expences attending the application  Adieu   Yours   ED  RIVERS     LETTER XL   40   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Silleri  Oct  20   I DANCED last night till four o clock in the morning  if you will allow the expression   without being the least fatigued  the little Fitzgerald was my partner  who grows upon me extremely  the monkey has a way of being attentive and careless by turns  which has an amazing effect  nothing attaches a woman of my temper so much to a lover as her being a little in fear of losing him  and he keeps up the spirit of the thing admirably       Your brother and Emily danced together  and I think I never saw either of them look so handsome  she was a thousand times more admired at this ball than the first  and reason good  for she was a thousand times more agreable  your brother is really a charming fellow  he is an immense favorite with the ladies  he has that very pleasing general attention  which never fails to charm women  he can even be particular to one  without wounding the vanity of the rest  if he was in company with twenty  his mistress of the number  his manner would be such  that every woman there would think herself the second in his esteem  and that  if his heart had not been unluckily pre engaged  she herself should have been the object of his tenderness       His eyes are of immense use to him  he looks the civilest things imaginable  his whole countenance speaks whatever he wishes to say  he has the least occasion for words to explain himself of any man I ever knew       Fitzgerald has eyes too  I assure you  and eyes that know how to speak  he has a look of saucy unconcern and inattention  which is really irresistible       We have had a great deal of snow already  but it melts away   tis a lovely day  but an odd enough mixture of summer and winter  in some places you see half a foot of snow lying  in others the dust is even troublesome       Adieu  there are a dozen or two of beaux at the door   Yours   A  FERMOR     LETTER XLI   41   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Nov  10   THE savages assure us  my dear  on the information of the beavers  that we shall have a very mild winter  it seems  these creatures have laid in a less winter stock than usual  I take it very ill  Lucy  that the beavers have better intelligence than we have       We are got into a pretty composed easy way  Sir George writes very agreable  sensible  sentimental  gossiping letters  once a fortnight  which Emily answers in due course  with all the regularity of a counting house correspondence  he talks of coming down after Christmas  we expect him without impatience  and in the mean time amuse ourselves as well as we can  and soften the pain of absence
