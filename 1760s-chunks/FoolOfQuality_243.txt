made me tremble for you  Had any other man  though  used     my wife so but I pass that matter over   I see you are too great     a hero to be threatened by any one  and I should consider that   you did what you did for my sake      So saying  we all went into a sort of a tavern  and  being shown to   a little parlour  I called for a pint of white wine          TEE FOOL OF QUALITY  255     As soon as we were seated  I took my new acquaintance very   lovingly by the hand  My dear friend  said I  I have conceived   a great respect and fondness for yon  and should be glad to know   who and what you are  I am a currier by trade  sir  and my name   is Peter Patience  You are patience itself  indeed  said Mr    Clement   but your wife  as I think  has taken the whole trade of   the currier into her own hands      Peter laughed  and replied She is a dear and a sweet girl as   ever lay by the side of a man  and she loves me as she loves her   own soul  Her blows were sweet blows to me   they were the   blows of her affection  For  though I did not matter the strokes   of my friend Benjamin a single fillip  yet every one of them went   to her heart  and she wanted to frighten me from ever taking   the like again      But pray  says I  how happened the quarrel between you and your   friend Benjamin  as you call him  Why  there it is  too  said   Peter  he also beat me out of his downright and true hearted   kindness to me      As this is holiday in the afternoon among us trades folk  Ben   Testy invited me to a share of a can of flip  at the Cat and Bagpipes   over the way  Just as we sat down  Peter  says he  I am told that   your Gatty is with child  I believe it may be so  says I  I am   glad of it  Peter  with all my heart   and so now remember that I   bespeak myself gossip  Why  that may happen  says I  just as   matters shall turn out  If the child is a boy  you shall be one of   the godfathers  and welcome   but if it is a girl this cannot be  for   my uncle Geoffry has already engaged himself  and I have some   expectations from him  And so  says he  you refuse to admit me   for your gossip  If it is a girl  says I  you see that I cannot    Oh   he cried  I had forgot  I was a rascal for proposing it   you   are of high blood  have high relations  and so scorn to have con    nections with a poor tradesman like me  That is not the case      indeed  my dear Ben  but Confound your dears   says he  I will     have no more of them  You are a covetous scoundrel  and value   money more than love    Well  says I  but will you be patient  will   you hear reason  my friend  Friend  friend  says he  my curse   upon all such friendships  I see into you now  You re an un    grateful  unloving  cold hearted villain  and I would sooner be god    father to a child of the Turk  So saying  he struck at me  and   repeated his blows across the table  But  as I saw that his choler   was inflaming more and more  I got up and retreated  merely   intending to defend myself till his passion should be spent upon   me  But you saw what happened  gentlemen  which I am heartily   sorry for  as I fear that my poor dear fellow is much hurt      Well  said my tutor  I have heard many definitions and many   disputes concerning the word courage  but I never saw the thing   itself till this day  Pray  Mr  Peter  were you never angiy    Scarce ever  sir  that I remember  at least on my own account     for I do not fear any man that steps upon the earth  and what is   it then that should make me angry  A man may be angry  said   Mr  Clement  from other motives sure besides that of fear  God   himself can be angry  and yet he cannot possibly fear
