  —Raymond was moved  and seemed ready to pay implicit obedience to the  dictates of his creature —Grey then spoke of the zeal of Reginhald his  brother  and his entire devotion to the service of his noble patron       This faithful Monk  said he  will be of use  Observe the Countess for  some days  continue your fond wooing with all modest and respectful  duty  but with unabated zeal  She will soon experience that the flight  of Oswald hath not proved effectual to collect her creatures round her   and the disappointment will depress her proud spirit  and convince her  that her own and her son s fate still depend on you  The day on which  your attendants are taught to expect your nuptials  may perhaps find her  consenting to your wishes  but why should we demand or expect her formal  consent  Reginhald shall join your hands by virtue of his sacred  authority  and pronounce the solemn benediction which shall make her  your s for ever  Her heart shall secretly applaud this gentle violence   At least  her son  restored to her arms  shall be the purchase of your  pardon         —Little of art was required to disguise or palliate the baseness of this  design  so effectually had he prepared the mind of Raymond for its  reception  by raising the storm of passions to darken and confound his  reason  This Lord at once resigned himself to the guidance of his  minion  and consented to pursue such measures as he should dictate  The  Monk was now summoned before him  and appeared in the most abject  abasement and servility  Raymond thanked him for his zeal  promised to  repay his services  and ordered him to observe exactly the directions of  his brother  Reginhald bowed lowly  and attempted to speak his duty and  submission  but in disordered and ungraceful language  then retired  with Grey   These wicked agents  thus invested with full authority  and prompted by  their hopes of interest and savour  vigorously pursued the work of  oppression and deceit   Reginhald repaired to his monastery  so was he directed by his brother   where he urged the fathers to proceed  without delay  in their obsequies  to the deceased Lord  as his widow now prepared  and had appointed a day  for her secend nuptials  which were only delayed   till these religious  rites had first been duely performed  The reverend clerks were arrayed  in their sacred vestments  and chaunted forth the solemn requiem  The  neighbouring peasants caught the religious sounds  curiously enquired  the cause of these extraordinary devotions  and spread the tidings of  the intended marriage thro  the adjacent country  In the mean time  the  attendants and domestics of Raymond were taught to expect the nuptials  of their Lord on a day assigned  and ordered to hold them ready for  this joyful event  The found of busy preparation was loud thro  all the  castle  and was heard even to the apartment of the Countess  who  wondered  enquired  and was not long a stranger to the cause  She  conceived it to be no other than an artifice of her importunate wooer   to deceive the friends of her house  and to destroy the credit of  Oswald  her faithful emissary  of whose confinement she was yet  uninformed   With scorn and indignation she reflected on the base  attempt to sully her bright fame  and to persuade her friends  that  in  defiance of the strict restraints of decent widowhood  and the respect  which the memory of a noble husband claimed  she had  within the space  of a few months  listened to the sollicitations of a new suitor  and  consented to receive the hand of her oppressor  If the honour and  reverence with which she reflected on Lord William had been somewhat  impaired by her suspicions of his disloyalty  a new and more violent  aversion to Lord Raymond now possessed her mind  and there still kept  up an inflexible resolution never to acknowledge his pretensions to her  inheritance  or to accept his love  In such dispositions she received  the visits of this Lord with disdain  nor answered his tenders of  affection  but by inveighing with all the bitterness of contempt and  abhorrence against the mean deceit which he was now  practising  Raymond was abashed  he could not deny the accusation  but   with an ill affected openness  declared that he had indeed assured his  friends  that his wishes would be speedily crowned  as he would not  suppose that she could ever continue thus unreasonably obdurate  and  obstinately insensible to her own happiness     Such were their interviews  and such the fixed aversion and proud  disdain of the Countess  unsubdued by oppression  grief  and fear  Her  tedious and melancholy hours were still wasted in alarms for her son   in anxious expectation of relief  of the arrival and vigorous  interposition of her friends  and of the defeat and disgrace of her  oppressor  In vain did she incessantly enquire  complain  condemn the  slow
