 Saturday noon  one o clock       My master is come home  and  to be sure  has been where he said  So once   he has told truth  and this matter seems to be gone off without a plot    No doubt he depends upon his sham wicked marriage  He has brought a   gentleman with him to dinner  and so I have not seen him yet          Two o clock       I am very sorrowful  and still have greater reason  for  just now  as I   was in my closet  opening the parcel I had hid under the rose bush    to see if it was damaged by lying so long  Mrs  Jewkes came upon me by   surprise  and laid her hands upon it  for she had been looking through   the key hole  it seems       I know not what I shall do  For now he will see all my private thoughts   of him  and all my secrets  as I may say  What a careless creature I   am   To be sure I deserve to be punished       You know I had the good luck  by Mr  Williams s means  to send you all   my papers down to Sunday night  the 17th day of my imprisonment  But   now these papers contain all my matters from that time  to Wednesday the   27th day of my distress  And which  as you may now  perhaps  never see    I will briefly mention the contents to you       In these papers  then  are included   An account of Mrs  Jewkes s arts   to draw me in to approve of Mr  Williams s proposal for marriage  and my   refusing to do so  and desiring you not to encourage his suit to me  Mr    Williams s being wickedly robbed  and a visit of hers to him  whereby   she discovered all his secrets  How I was inclined to get off  while she   was gone  but was ridiculously prevented by my foolish fears  etc  My   having the key of the back door  Mrs  Jewkes s writing to my master all   the secrets she had discovered of Mr  Williams  and her behaviour to me   and him upon it  Continuance of my correspondence with Mr  Williams by   the tiles  begun in the parcel you had  My reproaches to him for his   revealing himself to Mrs  Jewkes  and his letter to me in answer    threatening to expose my master  if he deceived him  mentioning in it   John Arnold s correspondence with him  and a letter which John sent  and   was intercepted  as it seems  Of the correspondence being carried on by   a friend of his at Gainsborough  Of the horse he was to provide for me    and one for himself  Of what Mr  Williams had owned to Mrs  Jewkes  and   of my discouraging his proposals  Then it contained a pressing letter of   mine to him  urging my escape before my master came  with his half angry   answer to me  Your good letter to me  my dear father  sent to me by   Mr  Williams s conveyance  in which you would have me encourage Mr    Williams  but leave it to me  and in which  fortunately enough  you take   notice of my being uninclined to marry   My earnest desire to be   with you  The substance of my answer to Mr  Williams  expressing more   patience  etc  A dreadful letter of my master to Mrs  Jewkes  which  by   mistake  was directed to me  and one to me  directed by like mistake   to her  and very free reflections of mine upon both  The concern I   expressed for Mr  Williams s being taken in  deceived  and ruined    An account of Mrs  Jewkes s glorying in her wicked fidelity  A sad   description I gave of Monsieur Colbrand  a person he sent down to assist   Mrs  Jewkes in watching me  How Mr  Williams was arrested  and thrown   into gaol  and the concern I expressed upon it  and my free reflections   on my master for it  A projected contrivance of mine  to get away out   of the window  and by the back door  and throwing by petticoat and   handkerchief into the pond to amuse them  while I got off  An attempt   that had like to have ended very dreadfully for me  My further concern   for Mr  Williams s ruin  on my account  And  lastly  my over hearing   Mrs  Jewkes brag of her contrivance to rob Mr  Williams  in order to get   at my papers  which  however  he preserved
