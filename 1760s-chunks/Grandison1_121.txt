woman should wish to be thought  The behaviour of my Lord to her  and of her to my Lord  is free  yet respectful  affectionate  but not apishly fond  One sees their Love for each other in their eyes  All Lovematches are not happy  This was a match of Love  and does honour to it  Every body speaks of Lady L  with equal affection and respect  as a discreet and prudent woman  Miss Grandison  by her livelier manner  is not so well understood in those lights as she ought to be  and  satisfied with the worthiness of her own heart  is above giving herself concern about what the world thinks of it   Lord L  is not handsome  but he is very agreeable  He has the look of an honest good man  and of a man of understanding  And he is what he looks to be  He is genteel  and has the air of a true British nobleman  one of those  I imagine  that would have been respected by his appearence and manners  in the purest times  an hundred or two years  or how long   ago   I am to have the family history of this Lord and Lady  on both sides  and of their Loves  their difficulties  and of the obligations they talk of being under to their brother  to whom both my Lord and Lady behave with Love that carries the heart in every word  in every look   What  my dear  shall we say to this brother  Does he lay every body that knows him under obligation  And is there no way to be even with him in any one thing  I long to have some intimate conversation with   298 Miss Grandison  by which I shall perhaps find out the art he has of making every body proud of acknowledging an inferiority to him   I almost wish I could  while I stay in town  devote half my time to this amiable family  without breaking in upon them  so much as to be thought impertinent  The other half ought to be with my kind cousin Reeves s  I never shall make them amends for the trouble I have given them   How I long for Wednesday  to see all the family of the Grandison s—They are all to be there—On several accounts I long for that day  Yet this Sir Hargrave—  I have written  my dear  as usual  very unreservedly  I know that I lie more open than ever to my uncle s observations  But if he will not allow for weakness of heart  of head  and for having been frighted out of my wits  and cruelly used  and for further apprehensions  and for the sense I have of obligations that never can be returned  why then I must lie wholly at his mercy—But if he should find me to be ever so silly a creature  I hope he will not make his particular conclusions general in disfavour of the Sex   Adieu  my dear Lucy —And in you  adieu all the dear and revered friends  benefactors  lovers  of  Your HARRIET BYRON   LETTER XL  Mrs  SELBY  To Miss HARRIET BYRON   Selby house Feb  25   My dearest Harriet   ALTHO  we have long ago taken a resolution  never to dictate to your choice  yet we could not excuse ourselves  if we did not acquaint you with any proposal that is made to us  on your account  that you might encourage it  or otherwise  as you thought fit   The dowager Lady D  wrote me a Letter some time ago  as you will see by the date   But insisted  that I   299 should keep the contents a secret in my own bosom  till she gave me leave to reveal it  She has now given me that leave  and requested that I will propose the matter to you  I have since shewn what has passed between her Ladyship and me  to your grandmamma  Mr  Selby  and Lucy  They are all silent upon it  for the same reasons  that I give you not my opinion  that is to say  till you ask it   But do we not see  my dearest child  that something has happened  within a very few days past  that must distance the hope of every one of your admirers  as they come to be acquainted with the circumstances and situation you are now in  My dear love  you will never be able to resist the impulses of that gratitude which always opened and expanded your worthy heart   Your uncle s tenderness for you  on such a prospect  has made him suppress his inclination to railly you  He professes to pity you  my dear  While  says he  the sweet girl was vaunting herself  and refusing this man  and dismissing that  and imagining herself out of the reach of the deity  to which sooner or later  all women bow  I spared her not  But now  that I see she is likely to be over head and ears in the passion  and has so much to be said for her excuse if she is caught  and as our side must perhaps be the hoping side
