God  added she  taking the papers out of her pocket  how little reliance ought we to have on a fair outside   Here are the letters  read what is in the cover first  I did so  it was ill writ  and worse spelt  These were the contents   Madam   I hear you are soon to be married to Mr Faulkland  but as I think it a great pity that so virtuous a young lady should be thrown away  this is to inform you  that he does not deserve you   The inclosed letter  wrote to him by a fine and beautiful young lady that he decoyed  shews you how false he is  When you tax him with it  he will know from whence you got your information  but let him deny it if he can   I am  madam  Your unknown friend  and humble servant   The letter to Mr Faulkland  in a very pretty female hand  and the date but a week old  from the time it was sent to me  was as follows   “Oh  Mr Faulkland  I am the most unfortunate woman in the world  Fatal have you been to me  and I am undone for ever—I was in hopes that our mutual fault might have been concealed  for  while we staid at Bath  I kept my aunt intirely ignorant of what passed between us  though she often pressed me to confess the truth  but it can now no longer be concealed  I am but too sensibly reminded of the unhappy consequences of my own weakness  and your ungoverned  would I could call it  love  I never meant to trouble you with complaints  but my present condition calls loudly for your compassion  Are you then really going to be married  There wants but this to complete my destruction  Oh  Sir  before it is too late  take pity on me  I dare not continue in the house with my uncle much longer  My aunt    says  that  when my affliction becomes so conspicuous as not to be any longer hid  she will form a pretence  on account of my health  for me to be absent for some months  under colour of going to Bath  or to London  for better advice than I can have here  But what will this avail me  I have no relations  no friends  nor acquaintance  that I can trust with the secret of my miserable situation  To whom then can I fly  but to you  the cause of all my sorrow  I beseech you  for Heaven’s sake  write to me  and tell me  if indeed you are going to give your self away for ever  If you are  your intended bride  perhaps  may have no other advantage of me  but what you in an evil hour deprived me of  Write to me  dear  though cruel as you are  and think of some place of refuge for your unhappy  A B ”  When I had read these letters  my mother asked me  What I thought of Mr Faulkland  Indeed  I was so astonished  that I scarce knew what answer to make  but replied  Madam  are you satisfied that this letter is not forged  with a design to injure Mr Faulkland  Ah  my dear said she  I am sorry you strive to catch at so slender a twig  you may be sure I am but too well convinced that the letter is genuine  or you should never have had a moment’s uneasiness by the knowlege of it  Mr Faulkland himself does not deny it  and it is with his permission that I kept it  I promised to return it  but desired leave to retain it for a few days  He could not refuse me this  though he might easily imagine I designed to shew it to you  That  indeed  was my intention  when I desired to keep it a little while in my hands  and I did so  that I might have your judgment on the letter itself  as well as fully to justify my own proceedings in what I have done  Ah  dear madam  cry’d I  scarce knowing what I said  I rely on your maternal goodness  I am sure you have done what is proper  Yet has Mr Faulkland nothing to say for himself —But I will ask no more questions—I know too much already—My love  said my mother  you have a right to know every thing relative to this affair   I shewed the letters to your brother  as soon as I received them  Sir George at first seemed quite confounded  but afterwards  to my very great surprize  he smiled  and said  he knew of that foolish business before  I asked him  if he knew of it before  how he could answer it to his honour  his conscience  or the love he ought to bear his sister  not to divulge it immediately  Why  said he  I assure you it is a trivial affair  that ought not to make you uneasy   What  George  I answered I  a trivial matter for a man to ruin a fine young lady  forsake her  and dare to involve an innocent creature
