a warrant of habeas  corpus  by him conveyed to the Fleet  and delivered to the care of the  warden   Here he was introduced to the lodge  in which he was obliged to  expose himself a full half hour to the eyes of all the turnkeys and  door keepers  who took an accurate survey of his person  that they might  know him again at first sight  and then he was turned loose into the  place called the master s side  having given a valuable consideration  for that privilege  This is a large range of building  containing some  hundreds of lodging rooms for the convenience of the prisoners  who pay  so much per week for that accommodation  In short  this community is  like a city detached from all communication with the neighbouring parts   regulated by its own laws  and furnished with peculiar conveniences for  the use of the inhabitants  There is a coffee house for the resort of  gentlemen  in which all sorts of liquors are kept  and a public kitchen   where any quantity of meat is sold at a very reasonable rate  or any  kind of provision boiled and roasted gratis  for the poor prisoners   Nay  there are certain servants of the public  who are obliged to go to  market  at the pleasure of individuals  without fee or reward from those  who employ them  Nor are they cooped up  so as to be excluded from  the benefit of fresh air  there being an open area  of a considerable  extent  adjacent to the building  on which they may exercise themselves  in walking  skittles  bowls  and a variety of other diversions   according to the inclination of each   Our adventurer being admitted a denizen of this community  found himself    6 22 15  3 45 PM   bewildered in the midst of strangers  who  by their appearance  did not  at all prepossess him in their favour  and  after having strolled about  the place with his friend Cadwallader  repaired to the coffee house   in order to be further informed of the peculiar customs which it was  necessary for him to know  There  while he endeavoured to pick up  intelligence from the bar keeper  he was accosted by a person in  canonicals  who very civilly asked if he was a new comer  Being answered  in the affirmative  he gave him the salutation of welcome to the  society  and  with great hospitality  undertook to initiate him in the  constitutions of the brotherhood  This humane clergyman gave him to  understand  that his first care ought to be that of securing a lodging   telling him there was a certain number of apartments in the prison let  at the same price  though some were more commodious than others   and that when the better sort became vacant  by the removal of their  possessors  those who succeeded in point of seniority had the privilege  of occupying the empty tenements preferable to the rest of the  inhabitants  howsoever respectable they might otherwise be  That  when  the jail was very much crowded  there was but one chamber allotted for  two lodgers  but this was not considered as any great hardship on the  prisoners  because  in that case  there was always a sufficient number  of males  who willingly admitted the females to a share in their  apartments and beds  Not but the time had been  when this expedient  would not answer the occasion  because  after a couple had been  quartered in every room  there was a considerable residue still  unprovided with lodging  so that  for the time being  the last comers  were obliged to take up their habitation in Mount Scoundrel  an  apartment most miserably furnished  in which they lay promiscuously   amidst filth and vermin  until they could be better accommodated in due  course of rotation   Peregrine  hearing the description of this place  began to be very  impatient about his night s lodging  and the parson  perceiving his  anxiety  conducted him  without loss of time  to the warden  who  forthwith put him in possession of a paltry chamber  for which he agreed  to pay half a crown a week  This point being settled  his director gave  him an account of the different methods of eating  either singly  in a  mess  or at an ordinary  and advised him to choose the last  as the most  reputable  offering to introduce him next day to the best company in the  Fleet  who always dined together in public   Pickle having thanked this gentleman for his civilities  and promised  to be governed by his advice  invited him to pass the evening at his  apartment  and  in the meantime  shut himself up with Crabtree  in order  to deliberate upon the wreck of his affairs  Of all his ample fortune  nothing now remained but his wardrobe  which was not very sumptuous   about thirty guineas in cash  and the garrison  which the misanthrope  counselled him to convert into ready money for his present subsistence   This advice
