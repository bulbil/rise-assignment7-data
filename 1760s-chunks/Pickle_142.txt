to produce such concession   to this command he was both deaf and dumb  and the repeated threats  of his master had no more effect than if they had been addressed to a  marble statue  At length  our hero  incensed at his obstinacy  started  up  and would have chastised him with manual operation  had not he been  prevented by the chevalier  who found means to moderate his indignation  so far that he contented himself with dismissing the offender from his  service  and after having obtained the discharge of the prisoners  gave  them a louis to drink  by way of recompense for the disgrace and damage  they had sustained   The knight  perceiving our young gentleman very much ruffled at  this accident  and reflecting upon the extraordinary deportment and  appearance of his valet  whose hair had by this time adopted a grizzled  hue  imagined he was some favourite domestic  who had grown gray in the  service of his master s family  and that  of consequence  he was uneasy  at the sacrifice he had made  Swayed by this conjecture  he earnestly  solicited in his behalf  but all he could obtain  was a promise of  re admitting him into favour on the terms already proposed  or at least  on condition that he should make his acknowledgment to the chevalier   for his want of reverence and respect for the French monarch   Upon this condescension the culprit was called up stairs  and made  acquainted with the mitigation of his fate  upon which he said  he would  down on his marrow bones to his own master  but would be d  d before he  would ask pardon of e er a Frenchman in Christendom  Pickle  exasperated  at this blunt declaration  ordered him out of his presence  and charged  him never to appear before his face again  while the officer in vain  employed all his influence and address to appease his resentment  and  about midnight took his leave with marks of mortification at his want of  success   Next day the company agreed to travel through Flanders in the diligence   by the advice of Peregrine  who was not without hope of meeting with  some adventure or amusement in that carriage  and Jolter took care to  secure places for them all  it being resolved that the valet de chambre  and the doctor s man should attend the vehicle on horseback  and as for  the forlorn Pipes  he was left to reap the fruits of his own  stubborn disposition  notwithstanding the united efforts of the whole  triumvirate  who endeavoured to procure his pardon   Every previous measure being thus taken  they set out from Lisle about  six in the morning  and found themselves in the company of a female  adventurer  a very handsome young lady  a Capuchin  and a Rotterdam  Jew  Our young gentleman  being the first of this society that entered   surveyed the stranger with an attentive eye  and seated himself  immediately behind the beautiful unknown  who at once attracted his  attention  Pallet  seeing another lady unengaged  in imitation of his  friend  took possession of her neighbourhood  the physician paired with  the priest  and Jolter sat down by the Jew   The machine had not proceeded many furlongs  when Pickle  accosting the  fair incognita  congratulated himself upon his happiness  in being the    6 22 15  3 45 PM   fellow traveller of so charming a lady  She  without the least reserve  or affectation  thanked him for his compliment  and replied  with a  sprightly air  that now they were embarked in one common bottom  they  must club their endeavours to make one another as happy as the nature  of their situation would permit them to be  Encouraged by this frank  intimation  and captivated by her fine black eyes and easy behaviour   he attached himself to her from that moment  and  in a little time  the  conversation became so particular  that the Capuchin thought proper  to interfere in the discourse in such a manner as gave the youth to  understand that he was there on purpose to superintend her conduct  He  was doubly rejoiced at this discovery  in consequence of which he hoped  to profit in his addresses  not only by the young lady s restraint   that never fails to operate in behalf of the lover  but also by the  corruptibility of her guardian  whom he did not doubt of rendering  propitious to his cause  Flushed with these expectations  he behaved  with uncommon complacency to the father  who was charmed with the  affability of his carriage  and on the faith of his generosity abated of  his vigilance so much  that our hero carried on his suit without further  molestation  while the painter  in signs and loud bursts of laughter   conversed with his dulcinea  who was perfectly well versed in these  simple expressions of satisfaction  and had already found means to make  a dangerous invasion upon his heart   Nor were the governor and physician unemployed  while their friends  interested themselves in this agreeable manner  Jolter no sooner  perceived
