 I have   overheard the specious guile  which some evil demon has practised upon   thee    Is it then certain   said HAMET   that this being is evil    Is   not that being evil  said ALMORAN    who proposes evil  as the condition   of good    Shall I then   said HAMET   renounce my liberty and life  The   rack is now ready  and  perhaps  the next moment  its tortures will be   inevitable    Let me ask thee then   said ALMORAN   to preserve thy   life  wilt thou destroy thy soul    O  stay   said HAMET   Let me not be   tried too far  Let the strength of Him who is Almighty  be manifest in   my weakness   HAMET then paused a few moments  but he was no longer in   doubt  and ALMORAN  who disbelieved and despised the arguments  by which   he intended to persuade him to renounce what  upon the same condition    he was impatient to secure for himself  conceived hopes that he should   succeed  and those hopes were instantly confirmed    Take then   said   HAMET  this unholy charm  and remove it far from me  as the sands of   Alai from the trees of Oman  lest  in some dreadful hour  my virtue may   fail me  and thy counsel may be wanting    Give it me then   said   ALMORAN  and feeling for the hands of each other  he snatched it from   him in an extasy of joy  and instantly resuming his own voice and   figure  he cried out   At length I have prevailed  and life and love    dominion and revenge  are now at once in my hand        HAMET heard and knew the voice of his brother  with astonishment  but it   was too late to wish that he had withheld the charm  which his virtue   would not permit him to use   Yet a few moments pass   said ALMORAN  and   thou art nothing   HAMET  who doubted not of the power of the talisman    and knew that ALMORAN had no principles which would restrain him from   using it to his destruction  resigned himself to death  with a sacred   joy that he had escaped from guilt  ALMORAN then  with an elation of   mind that sparkled in his eyes  and glowed upon his cheek  stretched out   his hand  in which he held the scroll  and a lamp of burning sulphur was   immediately suspended in the air before him  he held the mysterious   writing in the flame  and as it began to burn  the place shook with   reiterated thunder  of which every peal was more terrible and more   loud  HAMET  wrapping his robe round him  cried out   In the Fountain   of Life that flows for ever  let my life be mingled  Let me not be  as   if I had never been  but still conscious of my being  let me still   glorify Him from whom it is derived  and be still happy in his love        ALMORAN  who was absorbed in the anticipation of his own felicity  heard   the thunder without dread  as the proclamation of his triumph   Let thy   hopes   said he   be thy portion  and the pleasures that I have secured    shall be mine   As he pronounced these words  he started as at a sudden   pang  his eyes became fixed  and his posture immoveable  yet his senses   still remained  and he perceived the Genius once more to stand before   him   ALMORAN   said he   to the last sounds which thou shalt hear  let   thine ear be attentive  Of the spirits that rejoice to fulfill the   purpose of the Almighty  I am one  To HAMET  and to ALMORAN  I have been   commissioned from above  I have been appointed to perfect virtue  by   adversity  and in the folly of her own projects  to entangle vice  The   charm  which could be formed only by guilt  has power only to produce   misery  of every good  which thou  ALMORAN  wouldst have secured by   disobedience  the opposite evil is thy portion  and of every evil  which   thou  HAMET  wast  by Obedience  willing to incur  the opposite good is   bestowed upon thee  To thee  HAMET  are now given the throne of thy   father  and ALMEIDA  And thou  ALMORAN  who  while I speak  art   incorporating with the earth  shalt remain  through all generations  a   memorial of the truths which thy life has taught        At
