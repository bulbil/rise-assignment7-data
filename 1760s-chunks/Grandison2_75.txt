appetites  and consider all the rest of the world as made for themselves  the worst and most noxious reptiles in it   LETTER XVIII  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   THUS far had the Ladies proceeded in their interesting story  when the Letters of my grandmamma and aunt were brought me by a man and horse from London  By my answer you will see how much I was affected by the contents  The Ladies saw my uneasiness  and were curious to know the cause  I told them from whence the Letters came  and what the subject was  and that my aunt was to give for me  next Saturday  an answer to Lady D  in person     186 I then retired to write  When I had dispatched the messenger  the Ladies wished to know the resolution I had come to  I told them I had confirmed my negative   Miss Grandison  with archness  held up her hands and eyes  I was vexed she did  Then  Charlotte  said I  spitefully  you would not have declined accepting this proposal   She looked earnestly at me  and shook her head  Ah  Harriet  said she  you are an unaccountable girl  You will tell the truth  but not the whole truth   I blushed  as I felt  and believe looked silly   Ah  Harriet  repeated she  looking as if she would look me through   Dear Miss Grandison  said I   There is some Northamptonshire gentleman  of whom we have not yet heard   I was a little easier then  But can this Lady mean any thing particular  She cannot be so ungenerous  surely  as to play upon a poor girl  if she thought her entangled  All I am afraid of  is  that my temper will be utterly ruined  I am not so happy in myself  as I used to be  Don t you think  Lucy  that taking one thing with another  I am in a situation that is very teazing —But let me find a better subject   THE Ladies  at my request  pursued their FAMILY HISTORY   Lord L  and Miss Caroline went on  hoping for a change in Sir Thomas s mind  He would  no doubt  they said have been overcome by the young Lady s duty  and my Lord L  s generosity  had he not made it inconvenient to himself  to part with money   He went to town  and carried his daughters with him  and  it is thought  would not have been sorry  had the Lovers married without his consent  for he prohibited anew  on their coming to town  my Lord s visits  so that they were obliged to their sister  as she   187 pleasantly had told Lady L  for contriving to forward their interviews   Mean time  my Lord s affairs growing urgent  by reason of his two sister s marrying  he gave way to the offers of a common friend of his and Lord W s  to engage that nobleman  who approved of the match  to talk to Sir Thomas on the subject   Lord W  and the Baronet met  My Lord was earnest in the cause of the lovers  Sir Thomas was not pleased with his interfering in his family affairs  And indeed a more improper man could hardly have been applied to on the occasion  For Lord W  who is immensely rich  was always despised by Sir Thomas for his avarice  and he as much disliked Sir Thomas for what he called his profusion   High words passed between them  They parted in passion  and Sir Thomas resenting Lord L s appeal to Lord W  the sisters were in a worse situation than before  for now  besides having incurred the indignation of their father  their uncle  who was always afraid that Sir Thomas s extravagance would reduce the children to the necessity of hoping for his assistance  made a pretence of their father s ill treatment of him  to disclaim all acts of kindness and relation to them   What concern d the sisters still more  was  my Lord s declared antipathy to their brother  and that for no other reason  but because his father  who  he was sure  he said  could neither love nor hate in a right place  doated on him   In this sad situation were these Lovers  when overtures were made to Sir Thomas for his younger daughter  But tho  Miss Charlotte gave him no pretence to accuse her of beginning a Love affair unknown to him  yet those overtures never came to her knowledge from him  tho  they did from others  And would you have wondered  Harriet  said she  with   188 such treatment before my eyes as Caroline met with  if I had been provoked to take some rash step   No provocation  reply d I  from a father  can justify a rash step in a child  I am glad  and so  I dare say  are you  that your prudence was your safeguard  when you were deprived of that which so good a child might have expected from a father s indulgence  especially when a mother was not in being   Miss
