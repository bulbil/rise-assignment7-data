as he did  to find her go   with a dissolute companion and two gentlemen  who  he had reason to   believe  by the little he saw of their behaviour  were utter strangers   to her  in a hackney coach  He was once about to appear himself through   his disguise  and tell Miss Betsy  that he thought he had more right to   the honour of conducting her than those to whom she gave permission  but   the greatness of his spirit assisted his prudence in restraining him   from so rash an action       After this sight  it is not in the power of words to represent what it   was he felt  Reason was too weak to combat against the force of such   various emotions as for a time had the entire possession of his soul    though he thought Miss Betsy unworthy of his love  yet still he loved   her  and had she been witness of his present distracted state  she would   have seen the power she had over him  no less manifest in the moments of   his rage  than in those in which he had behaved with the greatest   tenderness and respect       His good sense  however  at last convinced him  that as no solid   happiness could be expected with a woman of Miss Betsy s temper  he   ought to conquer his passion for her  This he resolved to attempt  yet   thought  before he did so  it would become him to see her once more  to   argue gently with her  and to try  at least  if there were not a   possibility of making her see the errors she was guilty of       With this intent he went the next day to visit her  but  being told she   could see no company that day  was going from the door  when Miss Flora    who had watched for him at the parlour window  came and desired him to   walk in  His complaisance would not permit him to refuse her request    and  after the usual compliments  said he was sorry Miss Betsy was so   ill   You need not be in much pain   replied she  with a look which he   thought had more than ordinary meaning in it   she is not greatly   indisposed     Perhaps   cried Mr  Trueworth  with some warmth   she is   only so to me     I cannot say anything to that   returned Miss Flora     but her orders were in general to all that came  and I believe  indeed    she is not perfectly well  She came home extremely late last night  and   seemed in a good deal of disorder     Disorder  Madam   interrupted Mr    Trueworth  impatiently   For Heaven s sake  on what occasion     I wish   I could inform you   answered she   but at present I am not favoured   with her confidence  though there was a time when I was made partaker of   her dearest secrets  I wish those she now intrusts them with may be no   less faithful to her than I have been     I hope   said he   she has   none which  to be betrayed in  would give her pain   With these words he   rose up to go away  Miss Flora fain would have persuaded him to drink   tea  but he excused himself  saying he was engaged  that he came only to   enquire after the health of her fair friend  and could not have staid    if so happy as to have seen her       Scarce could this passionate lover contain himself till he got out of   the house  The manner in which Miss Flora had spoke of Miss Betsy  added   fresh fuel to the jealousies he was before possessed of  but  how great   soever his disturbance was  he found  on his return home  somewhat which   made all he had known before seem light and trifling                CHAPTER XII       Contains some passages which  it is probable  will afford more pain   than pleasure  yet which are very pertinent to the history  and   necessary to be related          Though the words which Miss Flora had let fall to Mr  Trueworth    concerning Miss Betsy  seemed as if spoken by mere chance  there was   couched under them a design of the most black and villainous kind that   ever entered the breast of woman  as will presently appear  to the   astonishment of every reader       In order to do this  we must relate an incident in Miss Betsy s life not   hitherto mentioned
