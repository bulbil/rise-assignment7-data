be  those ruffians being  familiarized to rape as well as murder    Soon after my appearance at Paris  I was favoured with the addresses  of several French lovers  but I never had any taste for foreigners  or  indeed for any amusement of that kind  except such as were likely to be  lasting  and settled upon a more agreeable footing than that of common  gallantry  When I deviated from this principle  my conduct was the  effect of compulsion  and therefore I was never easy under it  having  been reduced to the alternative of two evils  the least of which I was  obliged to choose  as a man leaps into the sea  in order to escape from  a ship that is on fire    Though I rejected their love  I did not refuse their company and  conversation  and  though my health was considerably impaired by the  shock I received in my last adventure  which was considerably greater  than I at first imagined  and affected my companion so much  that she  did not recover her spirits till she returned to England  I say   though I was for some time a valetudinarian  I enjoyed myself in great  tranquility for the space of ten months  during which I was visited  by English  Scotch  and French  of all parties and persuasions  for    6 22 15  3 45 PM   pleasure is of no faction  and that was the chief object of my pursuit   neither was I so ambitious of being a politician  as to employ my time  and thoughts upon subjects which I did not understand  I had admirers of  all sides  and should have spent my time very much to my liking  had not  I felt my funds sensibly diminish  without any prospect of their being  repaired  for I had been obliged to lay out a great part of the sum  allotted for my subsistence  in supplying my companion  my servant  and  myself with necessaries  in lieu of those which we had lost    Having before my eyes the uncomfortable prospect of wanting money in  a strange place  I found myself under the necessity of returning to  England  where I had more resources than I could possibly have among  foreigners  and with that view wrote to Lord    s agents  desiring that  I might be enabled to discharge my obligations at Paris  by the payment  of my pin money  Thus a negotiation commenced  and his lordship promised  to remit money for the clearance of my Paris debts  which amounted to  four hundred pounds  but he would not advance one farthing more  though  I gave him to understand  that  while he protracted the agreement  I  must inevitably be adding to my encumbrances  and that I should be  as effectually detained by a debt of twenty pounds  as if I owed a  thousand  Notwithstanding all my representations  he would not part with  one shilling over the net sum which I at first stipulated  so that  all my measures were rendered abortive  and I found it altogether  impracticable to execute those resolutions I had formed in his favour    Thus did he for a mere trifle embarrass the woman for whom he professed  the most unlimited love  and whose principles he pretended to hold in  the utmost veneration  Indeed  his confidence in my integrity was not  without foundation  for many wives  with one half of my provocation   would have ruined him to all intents and purposes  whereas   notwithstanding all the extraordinary expenses to which I had been  exposed by his continual persecution  he never paid a shilling on my  account except one thousand pounds  exclusive of the small allowance  which was my due  In a word  so much time elapsed before my lord could  prevail upon himself to advance the bare four hundred  that I was  involved in fresh difficulties  from which I found it impossible to  extricate myself  and though I had occasion to write a letter to my  benefactor Lord     in which I expressed my acknowledgment of past  favours  I could not venture to solicit more  even when I was encouraged  by a very obliging answer  wherein he declared  that the good qualities  of my mind and heart would bind him to me in friendship for ever    While I ruminated on my uncomfortable situation  which would neither  permit me to return to England  nor to stay much longer where I was  a  young Englishman of immense fortune took Paris in his way from Italy   accompanied by a most agreeable Scotchman of very good sense and great  vivacity  It was my good or ill fortune to become acquainted with these  gentlemen  who  having seen me at the opera  expressed a desire of being  known to me  and accordingly favoured me with a visit one afternoon   when the brisk North Briton engrossed the whole conversation  while  the other seemed fearful and diffident even to a degree of bashfulness   through which  however  I could discern a delicate sensibility and  uncommon understanding  There was
