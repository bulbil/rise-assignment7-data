lightly  we turned the swath to the wind  I went foremost  and the rest followed in due succession  I could not avoid  however  observing the assiduity of Mr  Burchell in assisting my daughter Sophia in her part of the task  When he had finished his own  he would join in her s  and enter into a close conversation  but I had too good an opinion of Sophia s understanding  and was too well convinced of her ambition  to be under any uneasiness from a man of broken fortune   Page  53  When we were finished for the day  Mr  Burchell was invited as on the night before  but he refused  as he was to lie that night at a neighbour s  to whose child he was carrying a whistle  When gone  our conversation at supper turned upon our late unfortunate guest    What a strong instance    said I    is that poor man of the miseries attending a youth of levity and extravagance  He by no means wants sense  which only serves to aggravate his former folly  Poor forlorn creature  where are now the revellers  the flatterers  that he could once inspire and command  Gone  perhaps  to attend the bagnio pander  grown rich by his extravagance  They once praised him  and now they applaud the pander  their former raptures at his wit  are now converted into sarcasms at his folly  he is poor  and perhaps deserves poverty  for he has neither the ambition to be independent  nor the skill to be useful    Prompted  perhaps  by some secret reasons   Page  54  I delivered this observation with too much acrimony  which my Sophia gently reproved    Whatsoever his former conduct may be  pappa  his circumstances should exempt him from censure now  His present indigence is a sufficient punishment for former folly  and I have heard my pappa himself say  that we should never strike our unnecessary blow at a victim over whom providence already holds the scourge of its resentment    —   You are right  Sophy    cried my son Moses    and one of the ancients finely represents so malicious a conduct  by the attempts of a rustic to flay Marsyas  whose skin  the fable tells us  had been wholly stript off by another  Besides  I don t know if this poor man s situation be so bad as my father would represent it  We are not to judge of the feelings of others by what we might feel if in their place  However dark the habitation of the mole to our eyes  yet the animal itself finds the apartment sufficiently lightsome  And  Page  55  to confess a truth  this man s mind seems fitted to his station  for I never heard any one more sprightly than he was to day  when he conversed with you    —This was said without the least design  however it excited a blush  which she strove to cover by an affected laugh  assuring him  that she scarce took any notice of what he said to her  but that she believed he might once have been a very fine gentleman  The readiness with which she undertook to vindicate herself  and her blushing  were symptoms I did not internally approve  but I represt my suspicions     As we expected our landlord the next day  my wife went to make the venison pasty  Moses sate reading  while I taught the little ones  my daughters seemed equally busy with the rest  and I observed them for a good while cooking something over the fire  I at first supposed they were assisting their mother  but little Dick informed me in a whisper  that they were making a wash for the face   Page  56  Washes of all kinds I had a natural antipathy to  for I knew that instead of mending the complexion they spoiled it  I therefore approached my chair by sly degrees to the fire  and grasping the poker  as if it wanted mending  seemingly by accident  overturned the whole composition  and it was too late to begin another   Page   unnumbered   CHAP  VII   A town wit described  The dullest fellows may learn to be comical for a night or two   WHEN the morning arrived on which we were to entertain our young landlord  it may be easily supposed what provisions were exhausted to make an appearance  It may also be conjectured that my wife and daughters expanded their gayest plumage upon this occasion  Mr  Thornhill came with a couple of friends  his chaplain and feeder  The servants  who were numerous  he politely ordered to the next ale house  but my wife  in the triumph of her heart  insisted on entertaining them all  for which  by the bye  the family was pinched for three weeks after  As Mr  Burchell had hinted to us the day before   Page  58  that he was making some proposals of marriage to Miss Wilmot  my son George s former mistress  this a good deal damped the heartiness of his reception  but accident  in some measure  relieved our embarrasment  for one of the company happening to mention her name  Mr
