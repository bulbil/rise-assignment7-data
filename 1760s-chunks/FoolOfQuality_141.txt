  suppose that the female infant  with bashful and lowly propensities    is just brought down  blushing and trembling from the nursery    Let us suppose her education to be taken hi hand by a mamma of   figure and fashion  and by other dames of quality  whose estimate   of happiness is measured merely by the mode  She now becomes   instructed in more instances of self denial than such as  dictated   and tuned by Christianity  would have sainted her for eternity    She is taught to suppress her natural feelings and inclinations  and   to bridle the impulses of an affectionate and an humble heart  She   is taught to prize what she dislikes  and to praise what she dis    approves   to affect coldness and distance to inferiors whom she   regarded  and to proportion her appearance of inclination and   respect to the station of the party      As I have been ear witness to several of these quality lectures    I might give you many familiar instances of their nature and         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  131     tendency  Fie  Harriet  says my lady  what does the girl blush   at  You are handsome and well shaped  my dear  and have   nothing to be ashamed of that I know  No one blushes nowadays   except silly country girls who are ignorant of the world  But do   not let your face be a town crier  Harriet  to let every body know   what you have in your mind  To be ashamed  my girl  is the   greatest of all shames      Again  my dear  I warn you that you must not be so fond of the   Miss Colosses  who used to visit you in the nursery  For  though   they are good sort of girls  their parents are people in but middling   life  and we never admit them when there s company in the house    And then there s the Miss Sinclairs  how low you curtsied to them   yesterday  and what a rout you made about welcoming and enter    taining them   but let me have no more of that  for though they   are rich  they are cits and people of business   and a nod of your   head  or inclination towards a curtsy  with some Yeses and Noes    when they ask you a question  will be matter enough of salute and   discourse from you to them      I must further advise you  Harriet  not to heap such mountains   of sugar  nor to pour such a deluge of cream into your tea   people   will certainly take you for the daughter of a dairymaid  There is   young Jenny Quirp  who is a lady by birth  and she has brought   herself to the perfection of never suffering the tincture of her tea   to be spoiled by whitening  nor the flavour to be adulterated by a   grain of sweet  And then you say you cannot like coffee  and I   could not but laugh  though I was quite ashamed at the wry faces   you made the other day  when you mistook the olives for   sweetmeats  But these things  my child  are relished by persons   of taste  and you must force yourself to swallow and relish   them also      I was talking a while ago of young Lady Jane Quirp  There s a   pattern for you  Harriet   one who never likes or dislikes  or says   or does any thing a hair s breadth beyond the pink of the mode    She is ugly  it is true  and very ill natured   but then she is finely   bred  and has all the becoming airs of a miss of distinction  Her   you must love  my child  and to her you must pay your court   for   you must learn to love and prefer such matters and persons alone    as will serve  in the beau monde  to render you noted and respected   for the accomplishments in vogue      These lessons and efforts  in time  have their influence  Miss   comes to accommodate her taste and relish of things to the taste   and relish of those whom she is proud to resemble  She now is   ashamed of nothing  but in proportion as it is below the top of the   mode   and she blushes at no indecency that fashion is pleased to   adopt  Her whole soul and essence is futilized and extracted into   show and superficials  She learns that friendship in high life is   nothing but compliment  and visits  intimacies  and connections    the polite grimace of people of distinction   that to talk elegantly   upon nothing is the sum of conversation   that beauty and dress are
