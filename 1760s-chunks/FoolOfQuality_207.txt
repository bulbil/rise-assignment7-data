me as my friend and welcome  but   not as my servant  and I shall see the comfort of old times in always   seeing you about me  Thank you  thank you  sir  he cried  I will   not disturb you with my tears   but I should die unblessed if I died   out of your presence   So saying  he rushed from me in a fit of   restrained passion      I then sent for my wife s maid  whom I formerly mentioned  She   had just heard of my discharging the other servants  and entered   with a sad and alarmed countenance  Come near  Susan  I am going   to part with you  said I   come to me  and give me a farewell kiss    She approached with downcast looks  when  taking her in my arms  I   pressed and kissed her repeatedly  and scarce withheld my tears    Oh  my girl  my Matty s precious girl   I cried  I am not forgetful   of your love  your honour  and your disinterestedness toward us    Here  my Susy  your darling mistress presents you with this bill of   a thousand pounds  and  if you choose  I will give you cash for it   within a quarter of an hour  This  however  does not discharge me   from my regard and attention to you  You are of a helpless sex  my   Susy  that is subject to many impositions and calamities   wherefore    when this sum shall fail you  come to me again come to me as to your     P2         212 TEE FOOL OF QUALITY      friend  as to your debtor  Susy  and I will repeat my remembrance    and repeat again  as you may happen to have occasion   for while I   have sixpence left the favourite friend of my Matty shall not want   her proportion      Here the grateful and amazed creature threw herself on the   floor  She cried aloud  while the family hearol and echoed to her   lamentations  She clasped my knees  she kissed my feet again and   again  I could not disengage myself  I could not force her from   me  Oh  my master   she cried  my all that is left to me of my   adored  my angel mistress   must I then be torn from you   must   you live without the service of the hands and heart of your Susy     But I understand your regard and care for me  my master  It is   a cruel and naughty world  and must be complied with      Here I compelled her to rise  and kissing her again  I turned   hastily to the chamber where my Matty s corpse had been laid     and bolting the door  and casting myself on the bed  I broke into   tears  and at length wept myself to sleep      While I was preparing to leave the once loved mansion  I found   in Mr  Gplding s cabinet a parchment that much surprised me  On   my marriage  he had proposed to make a settlement of his fortune   upon me  which  however  I obstinately refused to accept   where    upon  without my privity  he got this deed perfected  which con    tained an absolute conveyance to me of all his worldly effects and   possessions   and this again renewed in me the tender and en    dearing remembrance of each of those kindnesses and benefits   which he had formerly conferred upon me      I now found myself in possession of near a million of money    which  however  in my disposition of mind at the time  appeared no   worthier than so much lumber in a waste room  And I know not   how it was  that  through the subsequent course of my life  although   I was by no means of an economical turn  though I never sued for   a debt  nor gave a denial to the wants of those who asked  nor   turned away from him that desired to borrow of me  yet uncoveted   wealth came pouring in upon me      It was not without some sighs and a plentiful shower that I   departed from the seat of all my past enjoyments  I took lodgings   within a few doors of your father   and my little household con    sisted of my favourite Irishman  my little old man  two footmen    and an elderly woman who used daily to dress a plain dish of meat   for us      It was then  my fairest cousin  that your opening graces and   early attractions drew me daily to your house  my heart was   soothed
