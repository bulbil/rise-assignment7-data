the morning       I might as well have not gone to bed last night  for what sleep I had    Mrs  Jewkes often was talking to me  and said several things that would   have been well enough from any body else of our sex  but the poor woman   has so little purity of heart  that it is all say from her  and goes no   farther than the ear       I fancy my master has not slept much neither  for I heard him up  and   walking about his chamber  ever since break of day  To be sure  good   gentleman  he must have some concern  as well as I  for here he is going   to marry a poor foolish unworthy girl  brought up on the charity  as one   may say   at least bounty   of his worthy family  And this foolish girl   must be  to all intents and purposes  after twelve o clock this day  as   much his wife  as if he were to marry a duchess   And here he must stand   the shocks of common reflection  The great Mr  B     has done finely  he   has married his poor servant wench  will some say  The ridicule and rude   jests of his equals  and companions too  he must stand  And the disdain   of his relations  and indignation of Lady Davers  his lofty sister  Dear   good gentleman  he will have enough to do  to be sure  O how shall I   merit all these things at his hand  I can only do the best I can  and   pray to God to reward him  and resolve to love him with a pure heart    and serve him with a sincere obedience  I hope the dear gentleman will   continue to love me for this  for  alas  I have nothing else to offer    But  as I can hardly expect so great a blessing  if I can be secure   from his contempt  I shall not be unfortunate  and must bear his   indifference  if his rich friends should inspire him with it  and   proceed with doing my duty with cheerfulness          Half an hour past eight o clock       My good dear master  my kind friend  my generous benefactor  my worthy   protector  and  oh  all the good words in one  my affectionate husband    that is soon to be   be curbed in  my proud heart  know thy self  and   be conscious of thy unworthiness    has just left me  with the kindest    tenderest expressions  and gentlest behaviour  that ever blest a happy   maiden  He approached me with a sort of reined in rapture  My Pamela    said he  May I just ask after your employment  Don t let me chide my   dear girl this day  however  The two parsons will be here to breakfast   with us at nine  and yet you are not a bit dressed  Why this absence of   mind  and sweet irresolution       Why  indeed  sir  said I  I will set about a reformation this instant    He saw the common prayer book lying in the window  I hope  said he  my   lovely maiden has been conning the lesson she is by and by to repeat    Have you not  Pamela  and clasped his arms about me  and kissed me    Indeed  sir  said I  I have been reading over the solemn service   And   what thinks my fairest  for so he called me  of it   O sir   tis very   awful  and makes one shudder  to reflect upon it   No wonder  said   he  it should affect my sweet Pamela  I have been looking into it this   morning  and I can t say but I think it a solemn  but very suitable   service  But this I tell my dear love  continued he  and again clasped   me to him  there is not a tittle in it that I cannot joyfully subscribe   to  And that  my dear Pamela  should make you easy  and join cheerfully   in it with me  I kissed his dear hand  O my generous  kind protector    said I  how gracious is it to confirm thus the doubting mind of your   poor servant  which apprehends nothing so much as her own unworthiness   of the honour and blessing that await her   He was pleased to say  I   know well  my dearest creature  that  according to the liberties we   people of fortune generally give ourselves  I have promised a great   deal  when I say so  But I would not have said it  if  deliberately
