at Lady Betty Williams s  tho  the part I supported in the conversation there  precipitated his declaration   He was very unhappy  he said  to have so mortally disobliged me  and repeated all his former pleas  his   94 love  Rough love  I am sure  compassion  sufferings  and I cannot tell what  insisting  that he had forgiven much greater injuries  as was but too apparent   I told him  that I had suffer d more than he could have done  tho  his hurt was more visible than mine  That nevertheless I forgave him  as no bad consequences had followed between him and my protector— Protector  mutter d he —But that he knew my mind  before he made that barbarous attempt  And I besought him never more to think of me  and he must excuse me to say  that this must be the very last time I ever would see him   A great deal was said on both sides  my cousins remaining attentively silent all the time  And at last he insisted  that I would declare that I never would be the wife either of Mr  Greville or Mr  Fenwick  Assuring me  that the rash step he had taken to make me his  was owing principally to his apprehension  that Mr  Greville was more likely to succeed with me than any other man   I owed him  I told him  no such declaration  But Mr  Reeves  to get rid of his importunity  gave it as his opinion  that there was no ground for his apprehensions that I would give my hand to either  and I did not contradict him   Mr  Bagenhall and Mr  Jordan  before I could get away from this importunate man  came to enquire for him  He then owned  that they came in hope of seeing me  and besought me to favour him and them for one quarter of an hour only  I was resolved to withdraw  But  at Sir Hargrave s command  as impertinently given as officiously obeyed  Mr  Reeves s servant led them  his master indeed not contradicting  into the parlour where we were   The two strangers behaved with great respect  They came with a resolution to be pleased with me  and would not suffer themselves to be disappointed  But never did men run praises higher  than both these   95 gentlemen gave to Sir Charles Grandison  And indeed the subject made me easier in their company than I should otherwise have been   It is not possible  I believe for the vainest mind to hear itself prosusely praised  without some pain  But it is surely one of the sweetest pleasures in the world  to hear a whole company join in applauding the absent person who stands high in our opinion  and especially if he be one to whose unexceptionable goodness we owe  and are not ashamed to own  obligation   What further pleased me  was to hear Mr  Bagenhall declare  which he did in a very serious manner  that Sir Charles Grandison s great behaviour  as he justly called it  had made such impressions not only upon him  but upon Mr  Merceda  that they were both determined to turn over a new leaf  was his phrase  and to live very different lives from what they had lived  tho  they were far  they blessed God  from being before the worst of men   These gentlemen  with Mr  Merceda and Sir Hargrave  are to dine with Sir Charles to day  They both mentioned it with great pleasure  But Sir Hargrave did not seem so well pleased  and doubted of his being able to persuade himself to go  The invitation was given at Mr  Jordan s motion  who took hold of an indirect invitation of Sir Charles s  Mr  Jordan declaring  that he was resolved not to let slip any opportunity of improving an acquaintance with so extraordinary a man   The gentlemen took a very respectful leave  Sir Hargrave shewed so much dejection  and is so really mortified with the damage done to a face  that he used to take pleasure to see reflected in the glass  never once looking into either of th•se in the parlour he was in  all the time he staid  that I could once or twice have been concerned for him  had I not struggled to withheld my pity   He talk d of soon leaving town  and retiring to one   96 of his country seats  or of going abroad for a year or two  if he must have no hopes—Hopes  a wretch   When I seriously reflect  I don t know whether his mortification is not the happiest thing that could have befallen him  It wants only to be attended with patience —He is not now an ugly man in his person  His estate will always give him consequence  He will now think the better of others  and the worse of himself  He may  much worse  and not want as much vanity as comes to his share   But say you  my uncle  as I fansy you do  that I also may spare some of my vanity  and not be the worse girl —Ah  no —I am now very sensible of my own defects
