Before matters  therefore  come to extremities  I could wish  for your own sake  for your sister s sake  for my sake  for every body s sake  you would instantly come up to London  and endeavour at a reconciliation with Miss Mildmay  a woman who loves you to distraction    131 can scarcely refuse you a pardon for any offence  especially as the grant of that pardon will be an essential means of promoting her own happiness  and preserving the honour of her family  You see  by her mother s letter  where she is to be  and  if you have either a passion for her  an affection for your sister  a friendship for me  or a regard for yourself  you will immediately comply with so reasonable a request   Were we to weigh the force of your present objection to Miss Mildmay in a proper scale  it would appear so astonishingly trifling  that you yourself must wonder how you ever gave it any consideration  You are only fearful of being miserable  you say  if you marry Miss Mildmay  yet you prefer the real misery of giving her up  and involving the best of sister s  and a whole innocent family  in the utmost distress  rather than run the   132chance of an imaginary misfortune  is this a proceeding consistent with that good sense  which  in spite of all your faults  I must allow you  putting even every motive of generosity  friendship  and humanity entirely out of the question  Indeed  Sir Robert  the answer is greatly to your disadvantage  and  was I less acquainted with the extent of your abilities  I should be apt to form such opinions as would do no great credit to your understanding   I had almost forgot to inform you  that Mrs  Mildmay has sent up the jewels which you presented to her amiable daughter  when there was such a likelihood of a happy union between the two families—your sister actually sobbed when she mentioned them  and  in my hearing  ordered Harper to lock them up in some place where she might never have an opportunity of seeing them     133This letter  my dear Harold  is very long and very dull  but the anxiety in which I labour on your account  and the long train of evils which I foresee  should you foolishly neglect the advice which I have here given you  totally incapacitates me from attending either to method or connection  but what have I to do with method or connection in letters of friendship  Those who write only from the head  regard the beauty of composition  while those who speak from the heart  are utterly unmindful of ornament  Believe me therefore to be  Your very faithful C  MELMOTH     134  LETTER X  Lady HAVERSHAM to Sir ROBERT HAROLD   I DO not know in what form to begin a letter  where I heartily despise the the person to whom I write  nor how to think of calling any body by the tender name of brother  whom reason and justice oblige me to detest as a man  yet the powerful voice of nature subdues both my contempt and my indignation  and leads me on to try what can possibly be done to preserve his life and his character  before a publication of his infamy exposes him to inevitable danger and disgrace   Do not imagine  Sir  that  by insinuating an apprehension about your personal safety  I want to intimidate you into the   135 practice of honour or humanity  I know too well  from the many broils in which you have been already engaged on account of your profligacy  that a man of violence receives additional courage from the appearance of danger  and frequently thinks himself obliged to silence every dictate both of reason and justice  lest his bravery should suffer the smallest imputation  such a man I know you to be  and am satisfied that  in the present case  you will sooner think of justifying the infamy of your conduct  than dream of reparation  yet  Bob  by all the tenderness of our near relation  I conjure you to hear me this once with attention  as it is probably the last time I shall ever trouble you with my censures  or insult you with my advice   And tell we really  is it thus I am to be repaid for all my solicitude about your happiness  Is the family I most valued    136 to be dishonoured—the young lady whom I most loved  to be destroyed—and my own peace of mind to be eternally sacrificed  because I have  with an anxiety which few sisters ever felt to such a degree  been attentive to the minutest circumstance that could either improve your fortune  or encrease your felicity  Is the sister  for whom you profess so cordial an affection  the chief person marked out for the exercise of your cruelty  and the friends who were dearest to her in the world  the principal people whom you could think of loading with the most aggravating dishonour  and the most piercing distress  O  Bob—could I have thought this of you —Wild as I judged you in general  I believed you a man of sentiment at bottom  and could by no means suppose that  in the unsuspecting hour of confidence
