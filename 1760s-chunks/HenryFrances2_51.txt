only Parts of my Life   Henry   LETTER CCXLVI   I AM much obliged to my dear Harry for the Indulgence he is so kind to grant me  I have a much better Right to plead that Privilege  at present  than I can ever have from writing to Lady —  or any other Person  which is my being utterly incapable of writing  from real Illness  I have been all Day on the Bed  and  though I ventured to Bond Street  in hopes of rouzing my Spirits  I find myself so very weak and languid  that I am hardly able to hold the Pen  I have had a severe Fit of the Rheumatism in my Arm  which  joined to a constant Cough  Page  191 prevents my sleeping an Hour at a Time  the whole Night   I am ashamed of living a constant Complainant  I think  it would be but decent in me to die  for  indeed  I am quite weary of Life  But   Death comes not at Call  nor mends his slowest Pace for Plaints or Cries     I am extremely glad you are so happy in your Retirement  I would by no means have you quit it  for the tumultuous Haunts of busy  idle Men  Let me  at least  have the Satisfaction of thinking you are well  and well pleased  which is the only Thing on Earth  that can give real Pleasure to my dearest Life s own sick  Fanny   LETTER CCXLVII   My Dearest FANNY   I SENT to the Post Yesterday  but had no Letter from you  which I should have been extremely uneasy at  but that Kitty sent me on▪ from you to her  which does not say you are worse  though you still complain  I came over here  just after I wrote last to you  and breakfasted with Kitty in my Way  This was but the second Time I have seen her  since you left her  which she seems picqued at  and complains Page  192 that I am grown peevish  for she is one of those  who cannot distinguish between Gravity and Ill humour  or knows any Difference between Reproof and Scolding   I enjoy as much Solitude here  as I did lately at Belvidere  and live after my own Manner  which is  not to dine  till Night  I am more the Hermit here too  which makes some Variety  for I dress my own Meals  broil my Chops  and roast my Potatoes  by my Chamber Fire  for I chuse them clean  and they are but flatternly People  who rent this House from me  though they are English  and Protestants  I do assure you  my Life  that I grudge myself every Morsel I eat in this or any Retirement  unenjoyed by thee  and would very chearfully fast three Days  for the Pleasure of your dining with me the fourth   As I have a Way of philosophizing upon even the most trifling Occasions  I have begun to look upon Epicurism in a very different Light  from what I have always considered it  It is certain  that the Epicure has a greater and more frequent Enjoyment of Life  than a Man of vulgar Appetite  I grant  that the reducing our Wants to as few Things as possible  has more of the Philosopher in it  but  perhaps  to multiply our Pleasures may be the more sensible Scheme  within the Bounds of Reason and Innocence  They  who argue against this Voluptuousness  Page  193 may  from the same Rule  prohibit a refined Taste for Letters  Painting  or Music  But  though they should indulge us a little in  what they call  rational Pleasures  they will find  that all their vain Philosophy against the Enjoyments of Sense  is but a certain Stoical Pride  which would pretend to set human Nature above any Satisfaction  which they may have in common with Brutes  I wonder  they have not yet attempted to stop our Breath and Motion  because Brutes have both   I am  my dearest Life  while I have Appetite  Breath  or Motion  your own rational Brute   LETTER CCXLVIII   October 26  1751   AS I know it will give my sweet Love Pleasure  I find a very sincere one in being able to acquaint him  that I am vastly better  than when I wrote last  My Cough is somewhat abated  and I have slept tolerably well these two Nights   I fancy  I live as retired  in the midst of a great City  as you in your Hermitage  I cook for myself  and drink  rather than eat  by myself  for I live entirely on Broth  Chocolate  and Tea  I find  Slops agree with me much Page  194 better than Meat  for I am surely sick  if I touch it   My Wishes for you are not confined to Meal Times  nor do I suppose your s are  No Moment passes  but I sigh for you  What do I suffer in being separated from thee  When  when shall we meet  to part no more   I am so far an Epicurean  as to believe
