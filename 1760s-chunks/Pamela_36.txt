 I beseech you  raise all the house  No    said Mrs  Jervis  I will not stir  my dear lamb  I will not leave you    I wonder at you  sir  said she  and kindly threw herself upon my coat    clasping me round the waist  You shall not hurt this innocent  said she    for I will lose my life in her defence  Are there not  said she  enough   wicked ones in the world  for your base purpose  but you must attempt   such a lamb as this       He was desperate angry  and threatened to throw her out of the window    and to turn her out of the house the next morning  You need not  sir    said she  for I will not stay in it  God defend my poor Pamela   till to morrow  and we will both go together   Says he  let me but   expostulate a word or two with you  Pamela  Pray  Pamela  said Mrs    Jervis  don t hear a word  except he leaves the bed  and goes to   the other end of the room  Ay  out of the room  said I  expostulate   to morrow  if you must expostulate       I found his hand in my bosom  and when my fright let me know it  I was   ready to die  and I sighed and screamed  and fainted away  And still he   had his arms about my neck  and Mrs  Jervis was about my feet  and upon   my coat  And all in a cold dewy sweat was I  Pamela  Pamela  said Mrs    Jervis  as she tells me since  O  h  and gave another shriek  my poor   Pamela is dead for certain  And so  to be sure  I was for a time  for I   knew nothing more of the matter  one fit following another  till about   three hours after  as it proved to be  I found myself in bed  and Mrs    Jervis sitting upon one side  with her wrapper about her  and Rachel on   the other  and no master  for the wicked wretch was gone  But I was so   overjoyed  that I hardly could believe myself  and I said  which were my   first words  Mrs  Jervis  Mrs  Rachel  can I be sure it is you  Tell   me  can I   Where have I been  Hush  my dear  said Mrs  Jervis  you have   been in fit after fit  I never saw any body so frightful in my life       By this I judged Rachel knew nothing of the matter  and it seems my   wicked master had  upon Mrs  Jervis s second noise on my fainting away    slipt out  and  as if he had come from his own chamber  disturbed by   the screaming  went up to the maids  room   who  hearing the noise  lay   trembling  and afraid to stir   and bid them go down  and see what was   the matter with Mrs  Jervis and me  And he charged Mrs  Jervis  and   promised to forgive her for what she had said and done  if she would   conceal the matter  So the maids came down  and all went up again  when   I came to myself a little  except Rachel  who staid to sit up with me    and bear Mrs  Jervis company  I believe they all guess the matter to be   bad enough  though they dare not say any thing       When I think of my danger  and the freedoms he actually took  though I   believe Mrs  Jervis saved me from worse  and she said she did   though   what can I think  who was in a fit  and knew nothing of the matter   I   am almost distracted       At first I was afraid of Mrs  Jervis  but I am fully satisfied she is   very good  and I should have been lost but for her  and she takes on   grievously about it  What would have become of me  had she gone out of   the room  to still the maids  as he bid her  He d certainly have shut   her out  and then  mercy on me  what would have become of your poor   Pamela       I must leave off a little  for my eyes and my head are sadly bad   This   was a dreadful trial  This was the worst of all  Oh  that I was out of   the power of this dreadfully wicked man  Pray for
