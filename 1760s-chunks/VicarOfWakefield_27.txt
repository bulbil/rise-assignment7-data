if he had reserved all his learning to that moment    Ay  Sir  the world is in its dotage  and yet the cosmogony or creation of the world has puzzled philosophers of all ages  What a medly of opinions have they not broached upon the creation of the world  Sanconiathon  Manetho  Berosus  and Ocellus Lucanus  have all attempted it in vain  The latter has these  Page  138  words  Anarchon ara kai atelutaion to pan  which imply that all things have neither beginning nor end  Manetho also  who lived about the time of Nebuchadon Asser  Asser being a Syriac word usually applied as a sirname to the kings of that country  as Teglat Phael Asser  Nabon Asser  he  I say  formed a conjecture equally absurd  for as we usually say ek to biblion kubernetes  which implies that books will never teach the world  so he attempted to investigate—But  Sir  I ask pardon  I am straying from the question    —That he actually was  nor could I for my life see how the creation of the world had any thing to do with the business I was talking of  but it was sufficient to shew me that he was a man of letters  and I now reverenced him the more  I was resolved therefore to bring him to the touch stone  but he was too mild and too gentle to contend for victory  Whenever I made any observation that looked like a challenge to controversy  he would smile  shake his head  and say  Page  139  nothing  by which I understood he could say much  if he thought proper  The subject therefore insensibly changed from the business of antiquity to that which brought us both to the fair  mine I told him was to sell an horse  and very luckily  indeed  his was to buy one for one of his tenants  My horse was soon produced  and in fine we struck a bargain  Nothing now remained but to pay me  and he accordingly pulled out a thirty pound note  and bid me change it  Not being in a capacity of complying with his demand  he ordered the landlady to call up his footman  who made his appearance in a very genteel livery    Here  Abraham    cried he    go and get gold for this  you ll do it at neighbour Jackson s  or any where    While the fellow was gone  he entertained me with a pathetic harangue on the great scarcity of silver  which I undertook to improve  by deploring also the great scarcity of gold  and by the time Abraham returned  we had both agreed that money was never so hard  Page  140  to be come at as now  Abraham returned to inform us  that he had been over the whole fair and could not get change  tho  he had offered half a crown for doing it  This was a very great disappointment to us all  but the old gentleman having paused a little  asked me if I knew one Solomon Flamborough in my part of the country  upon replying that he was my next door neighbour    If that be the case then    returned he    I believe we shall deal  You shall have a draught upon him  payable at sight  and let me tell you he is as warm a man as any within five miles round him  Honest Solomon and I have been acquainted for many years together  I remember I always beat him at three jumps  but he could hop upon one leg farther than I    A draught upon my neighbour was to me the same as money  for I was sufficiently convinced of his ability  the draught was signed and put into my hands  and Mr  Jenkinson  the old gentleman  his man Abraham  and my  Page  141  horse  old Blackberry  trotted off very well pleased with each other     Being now left to reflection  I began to recollect that I had done wrong in taking a draught from a stranger  and so prudently resolved upon having back my horse  and following the purchaser  But this was now too late  I therefore made directly homewards  resolving to get the draught changed into money at my friend s as fast as possible  I found my honest neighbour smoking his pipe at his own door  and informing him that I had a small bill upon him  he read it twice over    You can read the name  I suppose    cried I    Ephraim Jenkinson    Yes    returned he    the name is written plain enough  and I know the gentleman too  the greatest rascal under the canopy of heaven  This is the very same rogue who sold us the spectacles  Was he not  a venerable looking man  with grey hair  and no flaps to his pocket holes  And did he not talk a long string of learning about Greek and  Page  142  cosmogony  and the world    To this I replied with a groan    Aye    continued he    he has but that one piece of learning in the world
