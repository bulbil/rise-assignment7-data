 and only take   notice of those which may extend your knowledge of the human   heart        Observe that little  mean looking  ill favoured person    said the   confessor  continuing a conversation  the beginning of which I need   not repeat    who acts as master of the ceremonies  You see his   feeble frame is quite worn out with debauchery  and he nods over   the grave in anticipated old age   yet still he affects an air of   levity and youth  and strives to inflame others by his discourse    to vices which he is no longer able to participate of himself   but   this is all grimace  and he assumes this appearance of gaiety    to hide the gloomy discontent and remorse that prey upon his   heart        There is something so particular in the story of this man  that   it may be worth while to give you a short sketch of it  He is a native   of a neighbouring country  where his father  from the lowest state   of poverty  amassed such wealth in trade  that his vanity prompted   him to get his family ennobled  to hide the meanness of his original    There is something so absurdly wrong in purchased nobility  that   it always turns the heads of the purchasers  perhaps in just retribu    tion for so flagrant an abuse of an institution meant as a reward   for merit  The ennobled man lived not to show the truth of this   observation   but his sons abundantly made up for that  the elder   lavishing his wealth on every kind of expensive vanity  and the   younger the person you see  glorying in every kind of debauchery    as if vice and folly were the prerogatives of their honour        In the course of a life of pleasure  he contracted an acquaintance   with that lady whom you see at the upper end of the room  Though   nature had never meant him for a man of intrigue  and debauchery   had exhausted even the little powers she gave  he thought it would   have been inconsistent with his character of a man of pleasure not   to commence an affair of gallantry with so deplorable a person    Accordingly  as she happened to be married  he directly cultivated   an intimacy with her husband  into whose unguarded confidence   he so far insinuated himself  as to receive many acts of friendship   from him  To a man who had any sense of honour or honesty    this would have been an irresistible reason for desisting from hia         260 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     baae design   but he was above such vulgar restraints  and genteelly   took the opportunity of the husband s friendship to debauch the   virtue of the wife        Nothing but the most abandoned profligacy in the woman could   have given success to such an attempt  as the husband exceeded   the paramour in every natural endowment of mind and person    beyond every degree of comparison   but the caprice of vicious   inclination is not to be accounted for   it will loath the moat   exquisite delicacies  and sate itself on garbage        They had not continued their commerce long  when their in    discretion betrayed them  It is impossible to describe the astonish    ment and rage of the injured husband at the discovery  Had it been   possible  he would have doubted his senses  which were witnesses   to his disgrace  In the first emotions of his rage  he was going to   break in upon them  and take the revenge which his superior strength   amply put in his power   but a moment s reflection showed him the   folly of such an action  and determined him to take the safer and   more severe revenge of the law        Accordingly  he withdrew without being perceived by them    and bringing some of his servants to testify their crimes  as soon as   he had secured the proof necessary to obtain his satisfaction  entered   the room in the height of their dalUance  and coolly telling them   that it would be proper for them to choose another scene for their   pleasure beside his house  retired  and left them to their meditations        This conduct convinced them of his design  and that they had   not a moment to lose to avoid some of the most disagreeable con    sequences of it  As soon  therefore  as they recovered from the   first impressions of their astonishment  they directly departed   together  and concealing the place of their retirement  for fear of a   pursuit  quitted the territories of the state as soon as they possibly   could
