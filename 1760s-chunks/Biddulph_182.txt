I am sure you have too much good nature and politeness to shock them all at once  by violating the laws of hospitality in this house  which your bounty has made mine  yet will you have sufficient room for retaliation  by treating them  in your turn  with neglect   Thou art a milkly thing  answered Mr Warner  but as I am willing    to please you  you may do as you like  but by—  and he swore a tremendous oath  they shall never have a cross from me   February 27  Having obtained Mr Warner’s consent  I went this day to my brother  He was not at home  but I was introduced to Lady Sarah  for whom I enquired  Poor woman  how she looked  My resentment was disarmed  and I felt nothing but pity  Her confusion was so great  she knew not how to receive me  she curtsied  without knowing what to say  or how to behave  I would not embarrass her too far  but taking a chair by her  As you favoured me with a message yesterday  Lady Sarah  said I  in as obliging a tone as I could speak  I thought it a sisterly duty to wait on you and Sir George  I hope my brother is well  I long to see him  and flatter myself he will forget all former coldness  and again be my brother   I spoke this long sentence on purpose to give her time to recover herself  She rubbed her hand over her forehead  I believe to hide the glow that was in her face from my first entrance  ‘Lord  Mrs Arnold—I am so surprized—this visit was so unexpected—I thought you were in the country’— her woman you know had been with me the day before  I passed this by however  I have not been out of town at all  Madam  I was detained by illness—‘I am mighty sorry for it—I hope you are quite recovered—pray  why did not you let me know you were ill ’ As I had heard nothing from you  Madam  after my first message  I was afraid that the mediation  you were so kind as to promise me  had failed  and that my brother’s resentment was so great  he would not hear of me   ‘Oh dear  that is true indeed—it was a sad affair—I mentioned you to your brother when he came to town  but he was in such a passion  I durst not name you to him again ’  She durst not name me  observe that  my dear  poor George  whom she governs with despotic sway   Then probably  Madam  my brother knew not all my distress  I protest I don’t know—said she—you know your brother is very warm  and whenever I attempted to speak of you  he always stopped me short—so—I don’t know how it was  but I never could get to tell him your situation—I should think I had great reason to resent my brother’s cruelty  Madam  said I  if he had known those particulars of which my maid informed you  but since he did not  I will not reproach him  neither will I accuse your ladyship of unkindness in concealing them from him  My sufferings are  thank God  at an end     and I am now come to offer you  and Sir George  my sisterly love  I hope he will not refuse me his love in return  I have nothing else now to ask for  She blushed again  and seemed in great confusion  ‘You are very good  Mrs Arnold  we must forget and forgive ’—Shall I not be permitted to see my brother  Madam  By the message I received from you  I was in hopes you had prevailed on him—The poor woman was now struck dumb  She felt for her snuff box  and would not find it in her pocket  but got up to look for it to gain a little time  rumaged her toilet  and at last  took it out of her pocket  offered me a pinch of snuff  then sat down again  Why  that message  to tell you the truth  said she  forcing a conscious silly smile  your brother knew nothing of  but not having heard from you in so long a time  I was resolved to enquire after you  and was determined myself  out of my own pin money  to allow you what I could spare  till I could get Sir George in better temper  but I made use of his name because I thought you would more readily accept of any thing from him than from me  Your brother thought you were actually in the country  till we were surprized with the account of the wonderful fortune that has come to you lately  ‘Then you had heard of it  Madam  interrupted I  before you sent to me ’ an untoward question  my dear  it plunged her again in the mud  and she flounced and floundered to get out  which only sunk her the deeper  We had heard a strange flying report  said she  of which I did not believe a word  and therefore sent Holmes  that is her woman’s name  to you to offer you my service   I was not ill natured
