finding myself   now entirely in her power  and that it is not for me to provoke her    I said  It is now  I see  in vain for me to contend against my evil   destiny  and the superior arts of my barbarous master  I will resign   myself to the Divine will  and prepare to expect the worst  But you see   how this poor Mr  Williams is drawn in and undone  I am sorry I am made   the cause of his ruin  Poor  poor man   to be thus involved  and for my   sake too   But if you ll believe me  said I  I gave no encouragement   to what he proposed  as to marriage  nor would he have proposed it  I   believe  but as the only honourable way he thought was left to save me    And his principal motive to it at all  was virtue and compassion to   one in distress  What other view could he have  You know I am poor and   friendless  All I beg of you is  to let the poor gentleman have notice   of my master s resentment  and let him fly the country  and not be   thrown into gaol  This will answer my master s end as well  for it will   as effectually hinder him from assisting me  as if he was in a prison       Ask me  said she  to do any thing that is in my power  consistent with   my duty and trust  and I will do it  for I am sorry for you both  But    to be sure  I shall keep no correspondence with him  nor let you  I   offered to talk of a duty superior to that she mentioned  which would   oblige her to help distressed innocence  and not permit her to go the   lengths enjoined by lawless tyranny  but she plainly bid me be silent on   that head  for it was in vain to attempt to persuade her to betray her   trust   All I have to advise you  said she  is to be easy  lay aside   all your contrivances and arts to get away  and make me your friend    by giving me no reason to suspect you  for I glory in my fidelity to my   master  And you have both practised some strange sly arts  to make such   a progress as he has owned there was between you  so seldom as I thought   you saw one another  and I must be more circumspect than I have been       This doubled my concern  for I now apprehended I should be much closer   watched than before       Well  said I  since I have  by this strange accident  discovered my hard   destiny  let me read over again that fearful letter of yours  that I   may get it by heart  and with it feed my distress  and make calamity   familiar to me  Then  said she  let me read yours again  I gave her   mine  and she lent me hers  and so I took a copy of it  with her leave    because  as I said I would  by it  prepare myself for the worst  And   when I had done  I pinned it on the head of the couch  This  said I  is   the use I shall make of this wretched copy of your letter  and here you   shall always find it wet with my tears       She said she would go down to order supper  and insisted upon my company   to it  I would have excused myself  but she began to put on a commanding   air  that I durst not oppose  And when I went down  she took me by the   hand  and presented me to the most hideous monster I ever saw in my   life  Here  Monsieur Colbrand  said she  here is your pretty ward and   mine  let us try to make her time with us easy  He bowed  and put on his   foreign grimaces  and seemed to bless himself  and  in broken English    told me  I was happy in de affections of de finest gentleman in de   varld   I was quite frightened  and ready to drop down  and I will   describe him to you  my dear father and mother  if now you will ever see   this  and you shall judge if I had not reason  especially not knowing he   was to be there  and being apprised  as I was  of his hated employment    to watch me closer       He is a giant of a man for stature  taller by a good deal than Harry   Mowlidge  in your neighbourhood  and large boned  and scraggy  and has   a hand
