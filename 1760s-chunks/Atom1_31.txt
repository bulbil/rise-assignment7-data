which is counted the ultima lex  or ultima ratio regum —In the same manner the    171 words infidel  heresy  good man  and political orthodoxy  imply very different significations  among different classes of people  A Mussulman is an infidel at Rome  and a Christian is distinguished as an unbeliever at Constantinople  A Papist by Protestantism understands heresy  to a Turk  the same idea is conveyed by the sect of Ali  The term good man  at Edinburgh  implies fanaticism  upon the Exchange of London it signifies cash  and in the general acceptation  benevolence  Political orthodoxy has different  nay opposite definitions  at different places in the same kingdom  at O—and C—  at the Cocoa tree in Pallmall  and at Garraway s in Exchange alley  Our orator was well acquainted with all the legerdemain of his own language  as well as with the nature of the beast he had to rule  He knew when to distract its    172 weak brain with a tumult of incongruous and contradictory ideas  he knew when to overwhelm its feeble faculty of thinking  by pouring in a torrent of words without any ideas annexed  These throng in like citymilliners to a Mile end assembly  while it happens to be under the direction of a conductor without strength and authority  Those that have ideas annexed may be compared to the females provided with partners  which  though they may croud the place  do not absolutely destroy all regulation and decorum  But those that are uncoupled  press in promiscuously with such impetuosity and in such numbers  that the puny master of the ceremonies is unable to withstand the irruption  far less  to distinguish their quality  or accommodate them with partners  thus they fall into the dance without order  and immediately anarchy ensues     173 Taycho having kept the monster s brain on a simmer  until  like the cow heel in Don Quixote  it seemed to cry  Comenme  comenme  Come  eat me  come  eat me  then told them in plain terms  that it was expedient they should part with their wives and their children  their souls and their bodies  their substance and their senses  their blood and their suet  in order to defend the indefensible farm of Yesso  and to support Brut an tiffi  their insupportable ally —The hydra  rolling itself in the dust  turned up its huge unwieldy paunch and wagged its forky tail  then licked the feet of Taycho  and through all its hoarse discordant throats  began to bray applause  The Dairo rejoiced in his success  the first fruits of which consisted in their agreeing to maintain an army of twenty thousand Tartar mercenaries  who were reinforced by the flower of    174 the national troops of Japan  sent over to defend the farm of Yesso  and in their consenting to prolong the annual tribute granted to Brut an tiffi  who  in return for this condescension  accommodated the Dairo with one of his free booting captains to command the Yessite army  This new general had seen some service  and was counted a good officer  but it was not so much on account of his military character that he obtained this command  as for his dexterity in prolonging the war  his skill in exercising all the different arts of peculation  and his attachment to Brut an tiffi  with whom he had agreed to co operate in milking the Japonese cow  This plan they executed with such effect  as could not possibly result from address alone  unassisted by the infatuation of those whom they pillaged  Every article of contingent expence for    175 draught horses  waggons  postage  forage  provision  and secret service  was swelled to such a degree as did violence to common sense as well as to common honesty  The general had a fellow feeling with all the contractors in the army  who were connected with him in such a manner as seemed to preclude all possibility of detection  In vain some of the Japonese officers endeavoured to pry into this mysterious commerce  in vain inspectors were appointed by the government of Japan  The first were removed on different pretences  the last were encountered by such disgraces and discouragements  as in a little time compelled them to resign the office they had undertaken  In a word  there was not a private mercenary Tartar soldier in this army who did not cost the empire of Japan as much as any subaltern officer of its own  and the annual charge of    176 this continental war  undertaken for the protection of the farm of Yesso  exceeded the whole expence of any former war which Japan had ever maintained on its own account since the beginning of the empire  nay  it was attended with one circumstance which rendered it still more insupportable  The money expended in armaments and operations  equipped and prosecuted on the side of Japan  was all circulated within the empire  so that it still remained useful to the community in general  but no instance could be produced  of a single copan that ever returned from the continent of Tartary  therefore all the sums sent thither  were clear loss to the subjects of Japan  Orator Taycho acted as a faithful ally to Brut an tiffi  by stretching the bass strings of the mobile in such a manner  as to be
