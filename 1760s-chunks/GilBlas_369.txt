of honour  and his father s matrimonial speculation on his behalf  A patent of nobility conferred on Gil Blas against his will   I HAD not yet half arranged Don Henry s household  when Scipio returned from Mexico  He brought with him three thousand ducats in cash  and merchandise to double the amount  I wish you joy  said I  the foundation of your fortune is laid  and if you prefer a snug berth at Madrid to the risk of going back  you have only to tell me so  There is no question about that  said the son of Coselina  a genteel situation at home is far preferable to a second voyage   After relating the birth and adventures of the little adopted Guzman  and my own appointment as tutor  I offered him the situation of upper servant to this babe of chance  Scipio  who could have devised nothing better for himself  readily accepted the office  and within the small space of three or four days got the length of his new master s foot   I had taken it for granted that that the verb grinders and concord manufacturers to whom I had given the plant of this Genoese bastard would lose stock and block  under the idea that he was of an intractable and profitless age  but my forebodings were completely reversed  He not only comprehended  but easily retained the lessons of his masters  and they were very well satisfied with him  I was in an enormous hurry to greet the ears of my lord duke with this intelligence  and he received  it with abundant joy  Santillane  exclaimed he with delight  you give me new life by the assurance of Don Henry s capacity and application  it runs in the blood of the Guzmans  and I am the more confirmed in his being unquestionably my own  because I am just as fond of him as if Madame d  Olivarez herself had lain in of the brat in due form under this very roof  The voice of nature  you perceive  will make itself heard  I thought it unnecessary to give his lordship any opinion on that subject  but with a delicate deference to his credulity  left him to enjoy his fancied paternity in peace  whether well or ill founded   Though all the Guzmans held this clod of newly turned up nobility in utter scorn  they were politic enough to smooth over the corrugations of their contempt  nay  some of them even affected to languish for his good opinion  the ambassadors and principal nobility then at Madrid waited on him  with all the ceremony appertaining to the rank of a legitimate son  The minister  intoxicated with the fumes of incense offered to his idol  began to build a temple worthy of the worship  The cross of Alcantara was the foundation  with a commandery of ten thousand crowns  The next step was to a high office in the royal household  and the completion of the whole was matrimony  Wishing to connect him with a family of the first rank  he picked out Donna Johanna de Velasco  daughter to the Duke of Castile  and had influence enough to accomplish the alliance  though against the will of the duke and of all his kindred   Some days before the nuptial ceremony  his lordship put some papers into my hand  saying  Here  Gil Blas  is a patent of nobility which I have procured as the reward of your services  My lord  answered I  in much astonishment  your excellency knows very well that I am the son of an usher and a duenna  it would be caricaturing the peerage to confer it on me  and besides  of all the boons in his majesty s power to bestow  it is that which I deserve and desire the least  Your birth  replied the minister  is a slight objection  You have been employed on affairs of state under the Duke of Lerma s administration and under mine  besides  added he with a smile  have you not rendered some things to Caesar  which Caesar is bound  on the honour of a prince  to render back in another shape  To deal candidly  Santillane  you will make just as good a lord as the best of them  nay  more than that  your high office about my son is incompatible with plebeian rank  and therefore have I procured you to be created  Since your excellency will have it so  replied I  there is no more to be said  So  saying no more  I put my new blown honours in my pocket  and walked off   Now can I make any Joan a lady  said I to myself when I had got into the street  but it was not the handy work of my parents that made me a gentle man  I may add a foot of honour to my name whenever I please  and if any of my acquaintance should snuff or snigger when they call me Don  I may suck my teeth  lean upon my elbow  and draw out my credentials of heraldry  But let us see what they contain  and how the corporeal particles  which have accrued during my artificial contact with the court  are distinguished by genealogical metaphysics from the native clay of my original extraction  The instrument ran thus in substance  That the king
