resumed the more interesting theme  and expressed myself with such transport and agitation  that my mistress  fearing I would commit some extravagance  rung the bell for her maid  whom she detained in the room  as a check upon my vivacity —I was not sorry for this precaution  because I could unbosom myself without reserve  before Miss Williams  who was the confidante of us both —I therefore gave a loose to the inspirations of my passion  which operated so successfully upon the tender affections of Narcissa  that she laid aside the restraint she had hitherto wore  and blessed me with the most melting declaration of her mutual flame —It was impossible for me to forbear taking the advantage of this endearing condescension —She now gently yielded to my embrace  while I encircling all that I held dear  within   234 my arms  tasted in advance  the joys of that paradise I hoped in a little time wholly to possess —We spent the afternoon in all the exstacy of hope that the most fervent love exchanged by mutual vows could inspire  and Miss Williams was so much affected with our chaste caresses  which recalled the sad remembrance of what she was  that her eyes were filled with tears   The evening being pretty far advanced  I forced myself from the dear object of my flame  who indulged me in a tender embrace at parting  and repairing to my lodgings  communicated to my friend Strap every circumstance of my happiness  which filled him with so much pleasure  that it run over at his eyes  and he prayed heartily  that no envious devil might  as formerly  dash the cup of blessing from my lip —When I reflected on what had happened  and especially on the unreserved protestations of Narcissa s love  I could not help being amazed at her omitting to enquire into the particular circumstances of the life and fortune of one whom she had favoured with her affection  and I began to be a little anxious about the situation of her finances  well knowing that I should do an irreparable injury to the person my soul held most dear  if I should espouse her  without being enabled to support her in the rank which was certainly her due —I had heard indeed  while I served her aunt  that her father had left her a considerable sum  and that every body believed she would inherit the greatest part of her kinswoman s dowry  but I did not know how far she might be restricted by the old gentleman s will  in the enjoyment of what he left her  and I was too well informed of the virtuosi s late conduct  to think my mistress could   235 have any expectations from that quarter —I confided  however  in the good sense and delicacy of my charmer  who  I was sure  would not consent to unite her fate with mine  before she had fully considered and provided for the consequence   The Ball night being arrived  I dressed myself in a suit I had reserved for some grand occasion  and having drank tea with Narcissa and her brother  conducted my angel to the scene  where she in a moment eclipsed all her female competitors for beauty  and attracted the admiration of the whole assembly —My heart dilated with pride on this occasion  and my triumph rejected all bounds  when  after we had danced together  a certain nobleman  remarkable for his figure and influence in the beau monde  came up  and in the hearing of all present  honoured us with a very particular compliment  upon our accomplishments and appearance —but this transport was soon checked  when I perceived his lordship attach himself with great assiduity to my mistress  and say some warm things  which I thought  savoured too much of passion —It was then I began to feel the pangs of jealousy—I dreaded the power and address of my rival—I sickened at his discourse  when she opened her lips to answer  my heart died within me—when she smiled  I felt the pains of the damned —I was enraged at his presumption  I cursed her complaisance  when he quitted her and went to the other side of the room —Narcissa suspecting nothing of the rage that inflamed me  put some questions to me  as soon as he was gone  to which I made no other reply than a grim look  which too well denoted the agitation of my breast    236 and surprized her not a little —She no sooner observed my emotion  than she changed colour  and asked what ailed me  but before I could make answer  her brother pulling me by the sleeve  bid me take notice of a lady who sat fronting us  whom I immediately  to my vast astonishment  distinguished to be Melinda  accompanied by her mother and an elderly gentleman  whom I did not know —   Wounds  Mr  Randan   cried the Squire  is she not a delicate piece of stuff — Sdeath  I have a good mind—if I thought she was a single person  —  Notwithstanding the perplexity I was in  I had reflection enough to foresee that my passion might suffer greatly by the presence of this lady  who in all probability would revenge herself upon me for having formerly disgraced her  by spreading reports to my prejudice —I was therefore alarmed at these symptoms of the Squire s admiration
