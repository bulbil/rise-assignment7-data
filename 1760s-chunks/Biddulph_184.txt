an abundance  a pair of most magnificent jars  above four feet high  which he values at a hundred and fifty pounds  these  with an entire service of the finest Nankeen china  and a most beautiful Persian carpet  I have set apart as a present for Lady V——  and shall send them to her the first opportunity   I have also got him to bespeak a set of jewels to the amount of fifteen hundred pounds  with which I intend to present Mrs Faulkland  This sum will not exceed my debt to Mr Faulkland  if his agreement with Pivet stands in force for the term prescribed   Mr Warner  who mightily loves to be employed  has undertaken to get these jewels made up for me in the most elegant taste   This man’s generosity is as inexhaustible as his riches  I fancy he is still some way concerned in trade  though he does not tell me so  These jars he said he had just received by the arrival of an East India ship  and I understand that his former dealings were extremely extensive  all over the world  he said  where there was commerce  he put in for his share   February 29  Lady Sarah has returned my visit  she was not slow you see in her ceremony  So obliging  so polite  every thing praised  and admired  and sister at every second word  and the children caressed  Arnold’s children  What a fine thing it is  my dear  to be independent  I shewed her all my house  but not with ostentation  I thought it would have looked affected not to have recommended so much wealth and    elegance to her notice  My sideboard she says is absolutely the handsomest she ever saw  indeed both for workmanship and richness it does surpass any I have seen   She told me she had talked to my brother and that though he still resented my obstinacy  as he called it  yet as I had made such advances towards a reconciliation  he was very ready to meet me  and desired every thing might be forgotten on my side  as it should be on his  He would have come to see you  added Lady Sarah  but as he does not chuse to meet Mr Warner  he would rather that the first interview between you were at his own house  I told her ladyship I would breakfast with her the next morning  and we parted upon wonderful courteous terms — February 30 Just returned from my brother’s  Sir George received me with open arms  and I returned the embrace with the utmost cordiality of affection  Surely  my dear  there is something wonderfully powerful in the natural affections  Sir George  spite of his resentment  his turbulence  and the threats denounced against me  could not at sight of me  after an absence of so many months  resist the first impulse of his heart  in giving me strong tokens of brotherly love  though probably had he not seen me  the latent tenderness might have lain for ever dormant in his heart   I entered immediately on the topic of my extraordinary acquisition  as I was determined not to lead to a subject which might bring on explanations so much dreaded by Lady Sarah  and I could observe that my brother avoided any thing tending that way as much as I did   He congratulated me heartily on my good fortune  but said  between jest and earnest  that if he could have divined his cousin Warner had come to him to make experiments  he should have taken care to have treated him better  But I don’t know how it was  said he  he came in an evil hour  and I was in an ill humour   Lady Sarah kept up the conversation with a great deal of vivacity  always taking care to keep us clear of the rock she was afraid of  till a lady  with whom she was engaged to go to an auction  called to take her up  Sir George would fain have detained me  but she insisted on my going with her  to have my judgment she said on the things she intended to buy  It appeared to me that she did not chuse to leave my brother and me together  for fear mutual confidence  in the fullness of our hearts  might have brought her disingenuous proceedings to    light  but cunning people often over act their parts  she was so extremely pressing  that my brother could not but take notice of it  I acquiesced to avoid giving her uneasiness  having first engaged my brother to dine with me on Friday  Lady Sarah and he both consented  but premised that Mr Warner was not to be of the party  this I ventured to promise  as I was resolved if Mr Warner invited himself  which is his usual way  to put him off by fairly telling him the truth  and trusting to his good nature for the consequence   March 2  After the trivial incidents of these last two days  my Cecilia  now hasten to more interesting particulars  But first a word or two of my cousin Warner  I had not seen him since the day that my brother and I met  till this morning  when he called to ask me how I did
