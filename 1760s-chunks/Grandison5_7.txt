for different ends  and that all might become useful links of the same great chain  Let us apply those talents to Labour  those to Learning  those to Trade  to Mechanics  in their different branches  which point out the different pursuits  and then no person will be unuseful  on the contrary  every one may be eminent in some way or other  Learning  of itself  never made any man happy  The ploughman makes fewer mistakes in the conduct of life than the scholar  because the sphere in which he moves is a more contracted one  But if a genius arises  let us encourage it  There will be rustics enough to do the common services for the finer spirits  and to carry on the business of the world  if we do not  by our own indiscriminate good offices  contribute to their misapplication   I will write to congratulate Lord W  and his Lady  I rejoice exceedingly in their happiness   I will also write to my Beauchamp  and to Lady Beauchamp  to give her joy on her enlarged heart  Surely  Dr  Bartlett  human nature is not so bad a thing  as some disgracers of their own species have imagined  I have  on many occasions  found  that it is but applying properly to the passions of persons  who  tho  they have not been very remarkable for benevolence  may yet be induced to do right things in some manner  if not always in the most graceful  But as it is an observation  that the miser s feast is often the most splendid  so may we say  as in the cases of Lord W  and Lady Beauchamp  the one to her sonin law  the other to his Lady and nieces  that when such persons are brought to taste the sweets of a generous and beneficent action  they are able to behave greatly  We should not too soon  and without makeing proper applications  give up persons of ability or power  upon conceptions of their general characters  and then  with the herd  set our faces against them  as if we knew them to be invincible  How many Page  18 ways are there to overcome persons  who may not  however  be naturally beneficent  Policy  a regard for outward appearances  ostentation  love of praise  will sometimes have great influences  and not seldom is the requester of a favour himself in fault  who perhaps shews as much self in the application  as the refuser does in the denial   Let Charlotte know  that I will write to her when she gives me a subject   I will write to Lord and Lady L  by the next mail  To write to either is to write to both   I have already answered Emily s favour  I am very glad that her mother  and her mother s husband  are so wife as to pursue their own interests in their behaviour to that good girl  and their happiness in their conduct to each other   My poor cousin Grandison—I am concerned for him  I have a very affecting Letter from him  But I see the proud man in it  valuing himself on his knowlege of the world  and rather vexed to be overreached by the common artifices of some of the worst people in it  than from right principles  I know not what I can do for him  except I were on the spot  I am grieved that he has not profited by other mens wisdom  I wish he may by his own experience  I will write to him  yet neither to reproach him  nor to extenuate his folly  tho  I wish to free him from the consequences of it   I write to my aunt Eleanor  to congratulate and welcome her to London  I hope to find her there on my return from Italy   The unhappy Sir Hargrave  The still unhappier Merceda  What sport have they made of their health  in the prime of their days  and with their reputation  How poor would have been their triumph  had they escaped  by a flight so ignominious  the due reward of their iniquitous contrivances  But to meet with such a disgraceful punishment  and so narrowly to escape Page  19 a still more disgraceful one—Tell me  Can the poor men look out into open day   But poor Bagenhall  sunk as he is  almost beneath pity  what can be said of him   We see  Dr  Bartlett  in the behaviour  and sordid acquiescence with insults  of these three men  that offensive spirits cannot be true ones   If you have any call or inclination to go to London  I am sure you will look in upon the little Oldhams  and their mother   My compliments to the young officer  I am glad he is pleased with what has been done for him   I have Letters from Paris  I am greatly pleased with what is done  and doing there  in pursuance of my directions  relating to the moiety of 3000l  left by the good Mr  Danby  to be disposed of at the discretion of his executor  either in France or England  As he gained a great part of his considerable fortune in France  I think it would
