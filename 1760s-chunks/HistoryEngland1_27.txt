the clergy  He endeavoured to get the crown to devolve upon his son  but this was not complied   78 with by the Bishops  It is said  though it has scarcely the appearance of truth  that he confined them in one house  and there threatened to detain them till they complied with his will  This was an extraordinary method of obtaining their consent  and seems inconsistent with his usual wisdom  his precautions  accordingly  proved unsuccessful  and the Archbishop found means to escape his guards  and fly into Normandy  in order to bring over a new King  and to raise a new insurrection   In consequence of this Bishops intrigues  Henry  son to the Empress Matilda  and who had been long acknowledged for Duke of Normandy  soon landed with a formidable army  The barons  ever restless and regardless of their obligations  were again divided upon this occasion  and a terrible civil war threatened the kingdom afresh  when  happily for the people  a truce was proposed between the opposite powers  this paved the way to a more lasting peace  It was agreed  that Stephen should enjoy the crown of England during his life  and that Henry should be acknowledged as his successor  In this manner a civil war was terminated  which had  for some years  laid England in blood  The nation once more began to respire from their calamities  and Stephen s death soon put his rival in possession of a crown  which  to the former  had afforded only disappointment  fatigue  and danger   I am   c     79  LETTER XII   Dear Charles   YOU have hitherto seen the barons and clergy becoming powerful in proportion to the weakness of the Monarch s title to the crown  and enriching themselves with the spoils of depressed Majesty  Henry Plantagenet had now every right  both from hereditary succession  and universal assent  that could fix a Monarch on his throne  conscious  therefore  of his strength  he began to resume those privileges which had been extorted from his predecessor s weakness   He first commenced by demolishing those castles which the barons and clergy built  and which only served as sanctuaries to guilt  treason  and debauchery  he dismissed the foreign troops which had been mercenaries to his predecessor  and  perceiving the poverty of the crown  resumed all those lands which properly belonged to it  and enacted some laws  by which the people  in some measure  became independent of their barons  by whom they were claimed as appurtenances to their estates and manors   He gave charters to several towns  by which the citizens claimed their freedom and privileges  independent of any superior but himself  These charters may properly be called the ground work of English liberty  the struggles heretofore were  whether a monarchy  or an aristocracy  should prevail  whether the King  or the nobility only  But  by this grant  the lowest orders of people began to have a just value for themselves  and to claim the prerogatives of humanity  Thus was the foeudal government  first impaired  liberty began   80 to be diffused more equally upon every rank of people  and the Kings became capable of levying armies independent of their vassals   But  though he in some measure diminished the power of the barons  by enlarging that of the people  yet still there was a third power  namely  the clergy  which daily grew stronger  and united by one bond  pursuing the same design  were making large strides to independence  He undertook to humble them also  he perceived the clergy were resolved  not only to be exempt from the usual taxes of the state  but even its punishments  They had extorted an immunity from all but ecclesiastical censures  in the preceding reign  and continued to maintain that grant in the present  It may easily be supposed  that a law  which thus screened their guilt  served but to increase it  accordingly  more than an hundred murders  upon proof  were committed by the clergy  of which not one was punished  even with degradation  What is still more astonishing  the Bishops gloried in their horrid indulgence  Among the number of murderers who were pardoned  was a clergyman of the diocese of Sarum  the complaint was brought before the Archbishop s court  and the circumstances of his guilt appeared most atrocious  However  the only punishment decreed was  that the murderer should be deprived of his benefice  and confined to a monastery  The King  struck with horror at such injustice  reproached the Archbishop  who  on the other hand  asserted  that an ecclesiastic could not be punished with death  and that the King had no right to intermeddle in the affairs of the church  This Archbishop was the noted Thomas a Becket  who had been advanced  by the King  to this high station from the meanest   81 obscurity  he was a man of strong passions  great pride  and great zeal  which had been  in the early part of life  smothered in deep dissimulation and apparent humility  He was  at this time  possessed at once of the chancellorship  of the archbishopric of Canterbury  and was legate to the Holy See
