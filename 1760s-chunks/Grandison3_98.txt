the sister  the friend  it is amazing to me  that you have kept such a mother in the dark so long   What can I say —Ah  madam —There she stopt  At last said  But my mother is in the interest of the man I cannot love   The question recurs—Are not your parents intitled to know your objections to the man whose interest they so warmly espouse   I have no particular objections  The Count of Belvedere deserves a better wife than I can make him  I should respect him very much  had I a sister  and he made his addresses to her   Well then  my dear Clementina  if I guess the reason why you cannot approve of the Count of Belvedere  will you tell me  with that candor  with that friendship  of the requisites of which we have been speaking  whether I am right or not   She hesitated  I was silent in expectation   She then spoke  I am afraid of you  madam   You have reason to be so  if you think me unworthy of your friendship   What is your guess   That you are prejudiced in favour of some other man  or you could not  if you had a sister  wish her an husband that you thought unworthy of yourself   I don t think the Count of Belvedere unworthy neither  madam   Then my conjecture has received additional strength     243 O Mrs  Beaumont  How you press upon me   If impertinently  say so  and I have done   No  no  not impertinently  neither  yet you distress me   That could not be  if I were not right  and if the person were not too unworthy of you  to be acknowleged   O Mrs  Beaumont  how closely you urge me  What can I say   If you have any confidence in me—If you think me capable of advising you—  I have confidence  Your known prudence—And then she made me compliments  that I could not deserve   Come  my dear Clementina  I will guess again—Shall I   What would you guess   That there is a man of low degree—Of low fortunes—Of inferior sense—  Hold  hold  hold—And do you think that the Clementina before you is sunk so low —If you do  Why don t you cast the abject creature from you   Well  then  I will guess again—That there is a man of a royal house  of superior understanding  of whom you can have no hope   O Mrs  Beaumont  And cannot you guess that this prince is a Mahometan  when your hand is in   Then  madam  and from the hints your Ladyship had given  I had little doubt that Clementina was in Love  and that religion was the apprehended difficulty  Zealous Catholics think not better of Protestants  than of Mahometans  Nor  indeed  are zealous Protestants without their prejudices  Zeal will be zeal  in persons of whatever denomination   I would not however  madam  like a sudden frost  nip the opening bud     244 There is  said I  a young soldier of fortune  who has breathed forth passionate wishes for Clementina   A soldier of fortune  madam  with an air of disdain  There cannot be such a man living  that can have his wishes answered   Well  then  to say nothing of him  there is a Roman nobleman—a younger brother—of the Borghese house—Permit me to suppose him the man   With all my heart  madam   She was easy  while I was at a distance   But if the Chevalier Grandison  She coloured at his name  has done him ill offices—  The Chevalier Grandison  madam  is incapable of doing any man ill offices   Are you sure  madam  that the Chevalier has not art —He has great abilities  Men of great abilities are not always to be trusted  They don t strike till they are sure   He has no art  madam  He is above art  He wants it not  He is beloved where ever he goes  He is equally noted for his prudence and freedom of heart  He is above art  repeated she  with warmth   I own  that he deserves every thing from your family  I don t wonder that he is caressed by you all  But it is amazing to me  that  in contradiction to all the prudent maxims and cautions of your country  such a young gentleman should have been admitted—I slopt   Why  now  you don t imagine  that I—that I—She stopt  and hesitated   A prudent woman would not put it in any man s power to give her a prejudice to persons of unexceptionable honour  and to manage—  Nay  madam  now has somebody prejudiced you against your countryman—He is the most disinterested of men   I have heard young Ladies  when he was here  speak of him as an handsome man     245 An handsome man  And is not Mr  Grandison an handsome man  Where will you see a man so handsome   And do you think he is so very extraordinary a man  as
