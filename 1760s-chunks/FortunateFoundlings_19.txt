  having  as he afterwards told me  informed him where I lived  and also   all the particulars he wanted to know concerning me       I was prodigiously surprized when I came home and found the Cabinet    which my woman imagined I had won by its being brought thither  It was   indeed a piece of gallantry I had no reason to expect from one so   perfect a stranger to me  and this  joined with the many complaisant   things he said to me at mrs  C  rt f  r s  flattered my vanity enough to   make me think he was no less charmed with me than I too plainly found I   was with him  I slept little that night  and pretty early the next   morning received a billet from him to this effect       MADAM        I thought the cabinet we raffled for was more   properly the furniture of a lady s closet than   mine  especially one who must daily receive a   great number of such epistles as it was doubtless   intended by the maker to contain  happy should   I think myself if any thing of mine might find   room among those which  for their wit and elegance    may be more worthy of preferring  tho    none can be for their sincerity more so than those   which are dictated by the eternally devoted heart of      HENRICUS        You cannot imagine  my dear Louisa  how delighted I was with these few   lines  I enclosed them indeed in the cabinet given me by the author of   them  but laid up their meaning in my heart   I was quite alert the   whole day  but infinitely more so  when in the evening my admired   Henricus made me a visit introduced by lord H      who had been one of   my late husband s particular friends  and had ever kept a good   correspondence with me       Henricus took  not the least notice either of the cabinet or letter   before him  and as I imagined he had his reasons for it  I too was   silent on that head  he took the opportunity  however  while lord H       was speaking to a young lady who happened to be with me  to ask   permission to wait on me with the hope of being received on his own   score as he was now on that of his friend  I told him that merit  such   as his  was sufficient to recommend him any where  and  besides  I had   an obligation to him which I ought to acknowledge  This was all either   of us had time to say  but it was enough to make me convinced he desired   a more particular conversation  and him  that it would not be   unwelcome to me       Thus began an acquaintance equally fatal to my peace of mind and   reputation  and having said that  it would be needless to repeat the   circumstances of it  therefore shall only tell you I was so infatuated   with my passion  that I never gave myself the trouble to examine into   the nature of his pretensions  and lull d with the vows he made of   everlasting love  resented not that he forbore pressing to that ceremony   which could alone ensure it   yes  my Louisa  I will not wrong him so   far as to say he deceived me in this point  for tho  he protested with   the most solemn imprecations that he would never address any either   woman than myself  yet he never once mentioned marriage to me   Alass    he too well saw into my heart  and that all my faculties were too much   his to be able to refuse him any thing   even so it proved   he   triumphed over all in my power to yield   nay  was so far subdued  that   I neither regretted my loss  nor used any endeavours to conceal   it   vain of being his at any rate  I thought his love more glory to me   than either fame or virtue  and while I was known to enjoy the one    despised whatever censures I incurred for parting with the other   in   the mall  the play house  the ring  at Bath or Tunbridge  he was always   with me  nor would any thing indeed have been a diversion to me had he   been absent       For upwards of a year I had no reason to complain of his want of   assiduity to me  tho  I have since heard even in that time he had other   amours with women who carried them on with more prudence than I was   mistress of  but I had afterwards a stabbing proof
