dote upon him  always inconsiderately stands in his way  and can I say to a man so very inclinable to raillery  that he should allow me more  and himself less  of Sir Charles s conversation  I wonder my aunt does not give my uncle a hint  But she loves Sir Charles s company as well as my uncle   This  however  is nothing to the distress my uncle gave me at dinner this day  Sir Charles was observing  upon the disposition of one part of the gardens at Boughton  That Art was to be but the handmaid of Nature—I have heard  Sir Charle  said my uncle  that you have made that a rule with you at Grandisonhall  With what pleasure should I make a visit there to you and my niece—  He stopt  He needed not  He might have said anything after this  Sir Charles looked as if concerned for me  yet said  that would be a joyful visit to him  My aunt was vexed for my sake  Lucy gave my uncle such a look —  My uncle afterwards indeed apologized to me—Ads heart  I was a little blunt  I believe  But what a duce need there be these niceties observed when you are sure —I am sorry  however—But it would out—Yet you  Harriet  made it worse by looking so silly   WHAT  Lady G  can I do with this dear man  My uncle  I mean  He has been just making a proposal to me  as he calls it  and with such honest looks of forecast and wisdom—Look ye  Harriet—I shall be always blundering about your scrupulosities  I am come to propose something to you that will put it out of my power to make mistake—I beg of you and your aunt to allow me to enter with Sir Charles into a certain subject  and this not for your sake—I know you won t allow of that—But for the ease of Sir Charles s own heart  Gratitude is my motive  and   140 ought to be yours  I am sure he loves the very ground you tread upon   I besought him for every sake dear to himself  not to interfere in the matter  but to leave these subjects to my aunt and me —Consider  Sir  said I  consider  how very lately the first personal declaration was made   I do  I will consider every thing—But there is danger between the cup and the lip   Dear Sir  my hands and eyes lifted up  was all the answer I could make  He went from me hastily  muttering good naturedly against Femalities   Deane s Grove  Wedn  27   MR  DEANE S pretty box you have seen  Sir Charles is pleased with it  We looked in at Fotheringay castle  a   Milton  b    c  Mr  Charles Deane  a very obliging and sensible young gentleman  attended his uncle all the way   What charming descriptions of fine houses and curiosities abroad did Sir Charles give us when we stopt to bait  or to view the pictures  furniture  gardens  of the houses we saw   In every place  on every occasion  on the road  or when we alighted  or put up  he shewed himself so considerate  so gallant  so courteous  to allow who approached him  and so charitable —Yet not indiscriminately to every body that asked him  But he was bountiful indeed  on representation of the misery of two honest families  Beggars born  or those who make begging a trade  if in health  and not lame or blind  have seldom  it seems  any share in his munisicence  But persons fallen from competence  and such as struggle with some instant distress  or have large families  which they have not ability to maintain  these  and such as these  are the objects of his bounty  Richard Saunders  who is sometimes his almoner    141 told my Sally  that he never goes out but somebody is the better for him  and that his manner of bestowing his charity is such  as  together with the poor peoples blessings and prayers for him  often draws tears from his eyes   I HAVE over heard a dialogue that has just now passed between my uncle and aunt  There is but a thin partition between the room they were in  and mine  and he spoke loud  my aunt now low  yet earnest only  not angry  He had been proposing to her  as he had done to me  to enter into a certain subject  in pity to Sir Charles  None had he for his poor niece  No doubt  but he thought he was obliging me  and that my objection was only owing to Femality  as he calls it  a word I don t like  I never heard it from Sir Charles   My aunt was not at all pleased with his motion  She wished  as I had done  that he would not interfere in these nice matters  He took offence at the exclusion because of the word nice  She said  He was too precipitating  a great deal  She did not doubt but Sir Charles would be full early in letting me know his expectations   She spoke more
