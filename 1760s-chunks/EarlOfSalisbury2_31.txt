overwhelmed Lord Raymond  and his wicked creature                  SECT  III     BUT whilst the anguish and consternation of Raymond  which arose from  shame and remorse  grew every moment more violent  Grey  who was  concerned solely for his personal safety  gradually regained some share  of recollection  and began to consider of the means to ward off the  impending danger from his own head  His chief reliance was on the  important service which he conceived to be in his own power  that of  discovering the residence of young William  and restoring him to his  father  But still farther to encrease his merit  and to atone for past  offences  he determined to betray his master  and to give him up  naked  and defenceless  into the hands of his enemies  This base resolution  once formed  no time was to be lost in executing it  Raymond was  preparing to depart  this must be instantly prevented  He flew among his  followers and attendants  he represented the danger which now threatened  them  in the most alarming colours  he told them  that their Lord had  long proceeded in a course of injustice and oppression  which must be  revenged with indiscriminate fury on all who had accompanied him  that  he now prepared to retire  hoping  that  whilst the injured Earl was  taking a bloody vengeance on his innocent followers  he might escape in  the confusion  that the only means of providing for their safety  of  approving their innocence  and of disarming the resentment of Lord  William  was to continue in their present situation  without any  appearance of hostile intentions  any purpose of opposing the entrance  of the rightful Lord of this castle  and to oblige their leader also to  stay and  answer for his own actions  To the nobler few he hinted these things  with caution  and they received his insinuations with disdain  loudly  declaring that they were resolved to live or die with Raymond  To the  baser and the greater number he spoke more plainly  To them he scrupled  not to declare  that the violent passions of their Lord had disordered  his understanding  and asked  with well affected terror  who could be  safe  after the outrageous dealing with his unhappy brother  whose only  fault was  that he had served Lord Raymond  alas   with too blind and  too violent a zeal —They heard him with approbation  and readily  consented to submit to his direction  in this dangerous emergency     The unhappy Raymond was now reduced to the lowest state of human  wretchedness  tormented with the consciousness of his own guilt and  weakness  unable to repair  or to atone for the mischief he had  occasioned  pierced with all the stings of remorse  unable to conceal  his disgrace  yet still too great of soul to bear it  helpless and  solitary  whilst the arm of vengeance was lifted against him  deserted  by his followers  and betrayed by the man whose wicked arts had sunk  him into this depth of misery  Grey  on the other hand  seemed to have  composed his fears  and to enjoy a short lived triumph  He had collected  a party round him  which gave him the command of the castle  His Lord  had retired to give his distractions some moments of rest  and his  creatures now issued out orders to his associates  to watch his motions   and even to oppose his departure by force     In the midst of his presumption  he sought Lord Raymond  whom he had but  now avoided  with the most abject terror  with an insolent composure he  desired him to explain his intentions —        Oh  are you come   cried Raymond —I have commanded my people to prepare  for departure  Let us this instant be gone  — Whither   said Grey  How  shall we escape  Whither shall we fly  The powers of Earl William are at  hand —But what of that   His resentment is not directed against us  We have not sought to pollute  his bed  We have not destroyed the repose and happiness of his wife         —His Lord started up in sudden fury  as if preparing to punish this  insolence  But Grey  nothing dismayed  bad him compose his passions   they had already proved too violent — Alas   said he       What was the crime of my unhappy brother — Guilty indeed he was  but not  to thee  cruel Lord  But I will not upbraid thee now —Those followers   whom Raymond cannot protect  he must no longer hope to command —Nay  my  Lord  seek not to pass  here thou hast no longer power  this chamber  must content thee  here must Earl William find thee  Answer him as thou  mayest         —There only wanted this treacherous insolence  to fill up the mighty sum  of
