had asked her leave to make proposals to her father  to whom she wholly referred herself   Sir Thomas seemed uneasy  and oddly answer d  he was sorry for it  He wish d his Lordship had not put such notions in the girl s head  Both his daughters would now be set a romancing  he supposed  They were  till now  modest young creatures  he said  Young women should not too soon be set to look out of themselves for happiness—He had known many quiet and orderly girls set a madding by the notice of men  He did not know what business young fellows had to find out qualifications in other mens daughters  that the parents of those daughters had not given themselves leisure to discover  A daughter of   149his  he hoped  had not encouraged such discoveries  It was to him but as yesterday  when they were crowing in the arms of their nurses  and now  he supposed  they would be set a crowing after wedlock   What an odd father was Sir Thomas  my Lucy —His own life  it is evident  had passed away very pleasantly   Indeed he could hardly bear to think  he added  of either of his daughters as marriagaeble yet  They have not been nursed in the town hot beds  my Lord  They are sober country girls  and good housewives  I love not that girls should marry before they have done growing  A young wife makes a vapourish mother  I forget their age—But twenty six or twenty eight is time enough for a woman  either for the sake of modesty or discretion  to marry   We may like gay men for husbands  my dear  Some of us do  But  at this rate  those daughters must be very good girls  who can make their best courtesies to their mothers  and thank them for their fancies  or the fathers must be more attentive to their growth than Sir Thomas was to that of his daughters —What have I said —I am here afraid of my uncle   My Lord was surprised  and well he might  Sir Thomas had forgot  as Lady L  observed  that he himself thought Miss W  was not too young at seventeen  to be Lady Grandison   My Lord was a modest Man  He was begging  as it may be called  the young woman  whom of all the women in the world he loved best  of her father  who was a man that knew the world  and had long made a considerable figure in it  and who  for reasons which would have held with him  had he lived to see her forty  had no mind to part with her  Yet my Lord pleaded his passion  her great and good qualities  as acknowledged by himself  and modestly hinted at the unexceptionableness of his own character  and the favour he stood in with his son  not saying the least   150 word of his birth and alliances  which some Lovers of his rank  would not have forgot  And  it seems  he was right in forbearing to make these accidents a plea  for Sir Thomas valued himself upon his ancestry  and used to say  that his progenitor  in James the First s time  disgraced it by accepting the title of Baronet   Sir Thomas allowed something to the plea of his standing well with his son  Let me tell you  my Lord  said he  that I shall take no step in a familyaffair of this consequence  without consulting with my son  and the rather  as he is far from expecting so much of my consideration for him  He is the pride of my life   My Lord desired  that his suit might be put upon the issue of his son s approbation   But pray  my Lord  what fortune do you expect with my girl  Well as you love her  I suppose the return of her Love for yours  which you seem not to doubt  will not be enough  Can the poor girl be a Countess without a confounded parcel of dross fasten d to her petticoat  to make her weight in the other scale   My circumstances  said my honest Lord L  permit me not  in discretion  to make that compliment to my Love  which my heart would with transport make  were they better  But I will lay them faithfully before you  and be determined by your generosity   I could not but expect  from a young man of your Lordship s good sense  such an answer as this  And yet I must tell you  that we fathers  who know the world  expect to make some advantage of a knowledge that has cost us so much  I should not dislike a little more romancing in Love  from a man that asks for my daughter  tho  I care not how little of it is shewn by my son to another man s  Every father thinks thus  my Lord  but is not so honest as to own it   I am sure Sir Thomas  that you would not think a man worthy of your daughter  who had no regard to   151 any thing  but the gratification of his own wishes  who could think  for the
