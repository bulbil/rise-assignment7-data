those unjust and groundless prejudices  which stood in the way of all my hopes  but does not this respect  this submission           2 101       demand that you should strictly examine those prejudices  and be convinced  before you make it  that they deserve such a sacrifice      Why will you  my dearest Lady Anne  urge your past unhappiness as a reason against entering into a state of which you cannot be a judge  You were never married  the soft consent of hearts  the tender sympathy of yielding minds  was wanting  forced by the will of a tyrannic father to take on you an insupportable yoke  too young to assert the rights of humanity  the freedom of your will destroyed  the name of marriage is profaned by giving it to so detestable an union        You have often spoke with pleasure of those sweet hours we past at Sudley Farm  Can you then refuse to perpetuate such happiness  Are there no charms in the unreserved converse of the man who adores          2 102       you  Or can you prefer the unmeaning flattery of fools you despise  to the animated language of faithful love      If you are still insensible to my happiness  will not my interest prevail on you to relent  My uncle  who has just lost his only son  offers to settle his whole estate on me  on condition I immediately marry  a condition it depends on you alone whether I shall comply with  If you refuse  he gives it on the same terms to a distant relation  whose mistress has a less cruel heart  Have you so little generosity as to condemn me at once to be poor and miserable  to lose the gifts both of love and fortune        I have wrote to Lady Belmont to intercede for me  and trust infinitely more to her eloquence than my own        The only rational objection to my happiness  my uncle s estate removes  you will          2 103       bring me his fortune  and your own will make Bell Hastings happy  if you now refuse  you have the heart of a tigress  and delight in the misery of others      Interrupted  my uncle  May all good angels guard the most amiable and lovely of women  and give her to her passionate    Bellville          2 104         To Colonel Bellville   Monday        WILL you marry me  my dear Ally Croaker   For ever this question  Bellville  And yet really you seem to be not at all in the secret   Respect  submission     I thought you had known the sex better  How should a modest woman ever be prevailed on by a respectful submissive lover  You would not surely have us             Oh  Heavens  A billet  Some despairing inamorato  Indeed  Lord Melvin  He is not going to make love to me sure        Very well  things are in a fine train  He writes me here as pretty an heroic epistle as one would desire  setting forth his passion for Bell Hastings  whom he has just          2 105       discovered is my niece  and whom he declares he cannot live without  owning appearances are against him  and begging me to convey to her a long tidi didum letter  explaining the reasons and causes    The story is tedious  but the sum total is this  That he found at Florence the friend on earth he most loved  engaged in an affair of honor  in which he could not avoid taking part as his second  that they went to the last town in the Tuscan state  in order to escape into another  if any accident made it necessary to elude the pursuit of justice  that  to avoid suspicion  he left orders with his people to say he had left Florence  that he wrote to her by his valet  who was unfortunately seized and confined  the affair being suspected  that he was wounded  and obliged to stay some time before he could return to Florence  when he was informed she had left Italy  and  though he had omitted no means to find her  had never been so happy as to succeed         2 106       had made his sister  Lady Louisa  his confident  and by her assistance had almost prevailed on his father to consent       Almost prevailed on   Really these are pretty airs  I shall write him an extremely stately answer  and let him know  if he expects Miss Hastings to do him the honor  his address must be in quite another style  Miss Hastings  in blood  in merit
