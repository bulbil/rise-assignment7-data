vetch the old wheel barrow and puten in  and carry him to good man Hodge s back door  he is more eable than we to lay out money upon poor vagrants  —    11 Her advice was taken  and immediately put in execution  I was rolled to the other farmer s door  where I was tumbled out like a heap of dung  and would certainly have fallen a prey to the hogs  if my groans had not disturbed the family  and brought some of them out to view my situation —But Hodge resembled the Jew more than the good Samaritan  and ordered me to be carried to the house of the parson  whose business it was to practise as well as to preach charity  observing that it was sufficient for him to pay his quota toward the maintenance of the poor belonging to his own parish —When I was set down at the vicar s gate  he fell into a mighty passion  and threatned to excommunicate him who sent as well as those who brought me  unless they would move me immediately to another place —About this time I fainted with the fatigue I had undergone  and afterwards understood that I was bandied from door to door through a whole village  no body having humanity enough to administer the least relief to me  until an old woman  who was suspected of witchcraft by the neighbourhood  hearing of my distress  received me into her house  and having dressed my wounds  brought me to myself with cordials of her own preparing —I was treated with great care and tenderness by this grave matron  who  after I had recovered some strength  desired to know the particulars of my last disaster —This piece of satisfaction I could not refuse to one who had saved my life  therefore related all my adventures without exaggeration or reserve  She seemed surprised at the vicissitudes I had undergone  and drew a happy presage of my future life  from my past sufferings  then launched out   12 into the praise of adversity with so much ardour and good sense  that I concluded she was a person who had seen better days  and conceived a longing desire to hear her story —She perceived my drift by some words I dropped  and smiling  told me  there was nothing either entertaining or extraordinary in the course of her fortune  but however  she would communicate it to me  in consideration of the confidence I had reposed in her —   It is of little consequence  said she  to tell the names of my parents  who are dead many years ago  let it suffice to assure you  they were wealthy  and had no other child than me  so that I was looked upon as heiress to a considerable estate  and tiezed with addresses on that account  Among the number of my admirers  there was a young gentleman of no fortune  whose sole dependence was on his promotion in the army  in which at that time he bore a lieutenant s commission —I conceived an affection for this amiable officer  which in a short time encreased to a violent passion  and  without entering into minute circumstances  married him privately —We had not enjoyed one another long  in stolen interviews  when he was ordered with his regiment to Flanders  but before he set out  it was agreed between us  that he should declare our marriage to my father by letter  and implore his pardon for the step we had taken without his approbation —This was done while I was abroad visiting  and just as I was about to return home  I received a letter from my father  importing  that since I had acted so undutifully and meanly  as to marry a beggar  without his privity   13 or consent  to the disgrace of his family  as well as the disappointment of his hopes  he renounced me to the miserable fate I had entailed upon myself  and charged me never to set foot within his doors again —This rigid sentence was confirmed by my mother  who  in a postscript  gave me to understand that her sentiments were exactly conformable to those of my father  and that I might save myself the trouble of making any applications  for her resolution was unalterable —Thunderstruck with my evil fortune  I called a coach and drove to my husband s lodgings  where I found him waiting the event of his letter —Though he could easily divine by my looks  the issue of his declaration  he read with great steadiness the epistle I had received  and with a smile full of tenderness  which I shall never forget  embraced me  saying  I believe the good lady your mother might have spared herself the trouble of the last part of her postscript —Well  my dear Betty  you must lay aside all thoughts of a coach   till I can procure the command of a regiment —This unconcerned behaviour  while it enabled me to support my reverse of fortune  at the same time endeared him to me the more  by convincing me of his disinterested views in espousing me —I was next day boarded in company with the wise of another officer  who had long been friend and confident of my husband  at a village not far from London  where they parted with us in the most melting manner  went to Flanders  and were killed in fight
