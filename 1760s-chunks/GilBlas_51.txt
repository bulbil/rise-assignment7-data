 and  as the physician had desired us above all things to give him enough  we began with pouring down two or three pints at as many gulps  An hour after we beset him again  then  returning to the attack time after time  we fairly poured a deluge into his poor stomach The surgeon  on the other hand  taking out the blood as we put in the water  we reduced the old canon to death s door in less than two days   This venerable ecclesiastic  able to hold it out no longer  as I pledged him in a large glass of his new cordial  said to me in a faint voice    Hold  Gil Blas  do not give me any more  my friend  It is plain death will come when he will come  in spite of water  and  though I have hardly a drop of blood in my veins  I am no better for getting rid of the enemy  The ablest physician in the world can do nothing for us  when our time is expired  Fetch a notary  I will make my will  At these last words  pleasing enough to my fancy  I affected to appear unhappy  and concealing my impatience to be gone  Sir  said I  you are not reduced so low  thank God  but you may yet recover  No  no  interrupted he  my good fellow  it is all over  I feel the gout shifting  and the hand of death is upon me  Make haste  and go where I told you  I saw  sure enough  that he changed every moment  and the case was so urgent  that I ran as fast as I could  leaving him in Dame Jacintha s care  who was more afraid than myself of his dying without a will  I laid hold of the first notary I could find  Sir  said I  the Licentiate Sédillo  my master  is drawing near his end  he wants to settle his affairs  there is not a moment to be lost  The notary was a dapper little fellow  who loved his joke  and inquired who was our physician  At the name of Doctor Sangrado  hurrying on his cloak and hat  For mercy s sake  cried he  let us set off with all possible speed  for this doctor dispatches business so fast  that our fraternity cannot keep pace with him  That fellow spoils half my jobs   With this sarcasm  he set forward in good earnest  and  as we pushed on  to get the start of the grim tyrant  I said to him  Sir  you are aware that a dying testator s memory is sometimes a little short  should my master chance to for get me  be so good as to put in a word in my favour  That I will  my lad  replied the little proctor  you may rely on it  I will urge something handsome  if I have an opportunity  The licentiate  on our arrival  had still all his faculties about him  Dame Jacintha was by his bedside  laying in her tears by wholesale  She had played her game  and bespoken a handsome remembrance  We left the notary alone with my master  and went together into the anti chamber  where we met the surgeon  sent by the physician for another and a last experiment  We laid hold of him  Stop  Master Martin  said the housekeeper  you cannot go into Signor Sédillo s room just now  He is giving his last orders  but you may bleed away when the will is made   We were terribly afraid  this pious gentlewoman and I  lest the licentiate should go off with his will half finished  but by good luck  the important deed was executed  We saw the proctor come out  who  finding me on the watch  slapped me on the shoulder  and said with a simper  Gil Blas is not forgotten  At these words  I felt the must lively joy  and was so well pleased with my master for his kind notice  that I promised myself the pleasure of praying for his soul after death  which event happened anon  for the surgeon having bled him once more  the poor old man  quite exhausted  gave up the ghost under the lancet  Just as he was breathing his last  the physician made his appearance  and looked a little foolish  notwithstanding the universality of his death bed experience  Yet far from imputing the accident to the new practice  he walked off  affirming with intrepidity  that it was owing to their having been too lenient with the lancet  and too chary of their warm water  The medical executioner  I mean the surgeon  seeing that his functions also were at an end  followed Doctor Sangrado   As soon as we saw the breath out of our patron s body  Dame Jacintha  Inésilla  and myself  joined in a decent chorus of funeral lamentation  loud enough to produce a proper effect in the neighbourhood  The emblem of a life to come  though she had more reason than any of us to rejoice  took the soprano part  and screamed out her afflictions in a most pathetic manner  The room in
