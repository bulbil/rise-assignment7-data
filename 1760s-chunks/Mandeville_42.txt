          1 217       without over fatiguing  may prevent its languishing in a painful inactivity  To this end  I would recommend to every man to have not only some important point in view  but many subordinate ones  to fill up those vacant hours  when our great purpose  whatever it is  must be suspended  our very pleasures  even the best  will fatigue  if not relieved by variety  the mind cannot always be on the stretch  nor attentive to the same object  however pleasing  Relaxation is as necessary as activity  to keep the soul in its due equipoise  No innocent amusement  however trifling it may seem to the rigid or the proud  is below the regard of a rational creature  which keeps the mind in play  and unbends it from more serious pursuits      I often regard  at once with pity and astonishment  persons of my own rank and age  dragged about in unwieldy state  forging for themselves the galling fetters of          1 218       eternal ceremony  or the still heavier chains of ambition  their bodies bending under the weight of dress  their minds for ever filled with the idea of their own dignity and importance  to the fear of lessening which  they sacrifise all the genuine pleasures of life      Heaven grant  my dear friend  I may never be too wise  or too proud  to be happy        To you  my amiable friend  who are just entering on the stage of life  I would recommend such active pursuits as may make you an useful member of society  and contribute to raise your own fortune and consequence in the world  as well as secure the esteem of your fellow citizens  and the approbation of your Prince        For my own part  like the Roman veterans  I may now be excused  if I ask          1 219       my discharge from those anxious pursuits  which are only becoming in the vigor of our days  and from those ceremonial attentions  which are scarce bearable even them  My duty as a Senator  and my respect to my King  nothing but real inability shall ever suspend  but for the rest  I think it time at sixty to be free  to live to one s self  and in one s own way  and endeavour to be  rather than to seem  happy      The rest of my days  except those I owe to my country and my Prince  shall be devoted to the sweets of conjugal and paternal affection  to the lively joys of friendship  I have only one wish as to this world  to see Julia married to a man who deserves her  who has sensibility to make her happy  and whose rank and fortune are such as may justify us to the world  above which the most philosophic mind cannot entirely rise  let me but see this  and have a hope that they will pursue my          1 220       plan of life  let me see them blest in each other  and blessing all round them  and my measure of earthly felicity will be complete      You know not  my dear Mr  Mandeville  how much my happiness in this world has been owing also to the lively hope of another  this idea has given me a constant serenity  which may not improperly be called the health of the mind  and which has diffused a brightness over all my hours        Your account of Lord T    made me smile  his fear of being dismissed at seventy from the toilsome drudgery of business is truly ridiculous  rich  childless  infirm  ought not ease and retirement to be the first objects of his wishes  But such is the wretched slavery of all who are under the absolute dominion of any passion  unguided by the hand of reason            1 221          The passions of every kind  under proper restraints  are the gentle breezes which keep life from stagnation  but  let loose  they are the storms and whirlwinds which tear up all before them  and scatter ruin and destruction around        Adieu  I ought to apologize for the length of this  but age is the season of garrulity     Your affectionate   Belmont           1 222         To the Earl of Belmont      HOW happy would it be for mankind  if every person of your Lordship s rank and fortune governed themselves by the same generous maxims        It is with infinite pain I see Lord T    pursuing a plan  which has drawn on him the curse of thousands  and made his estate a scene of desolation  his
