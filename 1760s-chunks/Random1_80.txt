 for I was  at the request of the surgeon  exempted from all other duty  than that of assisting his mates in making and administring medicines to the sick —This good office I owed to the friendship of Mr  Thomson  who had represented me in such a favourable light to the surgeon  that he demanded me of the lieutenant  to supply the place of his third mate  who was lately dead —When I had obtained this favour  my friend Thomson carried me down to the cockpit  which is the place allotted for the habitation of the surgeon s mates  And when he had shewn me their birth  as he called it  I was filled with astonishment and horror —We descended by divers ladders to a space as dark as a dungeon  which I understood was immersed several feet under water  being immediately above the hold  I had no sooner approached this dismal gulph  than my nose was saluted with an intolerable stench of putrified cheese  and rancid butter  that issued from an apartment at the foot of the ladder  resembling a chandler s shop  where  by the faint glimmering of a candle  I could perceive a man with a pale meagre countenance  sitting behind a kind of desk  having spectacles on his nose  and a pen in his hand —This  I learned of Mr  Thomson  was the ship s steward  who sat there to distribute provision to the several messes  and to mark   227 what each received —He therefore presented my name to him  and desired I might be entered in his mess  then taking a light in his hand  conducted me to the place of his residence  which was a square of about six feet  surrounded with the medicine chest  that of the first mate  his own  and a board by way of table fastened to the mizen mast it was also enclosed with canvas nailed round to the beams of the ship  to screen us from the cold  as well as the view of the midshipmen and quarter masters  who lodged within the cable tiers on each side of us  In this gloomy mansion  he entertained me with some cold salt pork  which he brought from a sort of locker  fixed above the table  and calling for the boy of the mess  sent him for a can of beer  of which he made excellent flip to crown the banquet —By this time I began to recover my spirits  which had been exceedingly depressed with the appearance of every thing about me  and could no longer refrain from asking the particulars of Mr  Thomson s fortune  since I had seen him in London —He told me  that being disappointed in his expectations of borrowing money to gratify the rapacious s—t—ry at the Navy office  he found himself utterly unable to subsist any longer in town  and had actually offered his service  in quality of mate  to the surgeon of a merchant s ship bound to Guinea on the slaving trade  when one morning  a young fellow  of whom he had some acquaintance  came to his lodgings  and informed him  that he had seen a wa rant made out in his name at the Navy office  for surgeon s second mate of a third rate  This unexpected piece of good news he could scarcely believe to be true  more especially  as he had   228 been found qualified at Surgeon s hall for third mate only  but that he might not be wanting to himself  he went thither to be assured  and actually found it so  Whereupon  demanding his warrant  it was delivered to him  and the oaths administred immediately —That very afternoon  he went to Gravesend in the tilt boat  from whence he took a place in the tide coach for Rochester  next morning got on board the Thunder  for which he was appointed  then lying in the harbour at Chatham  and the same day was mustered by the clerk of the checque —And well it was for him  that such expedition was used  for in less then twelve hours after his arrival  another William Thomson came on board  affirming that he was the person for whom the warrant was expedited  and that the other was an impostor —My friend was grievously alarmed at this accident  the more so  as his namesake had very much the advantage over him  both in assurance and dress —However  to acquit himself of the suspicion of imposture  he produced several letters written from Scotland to him in that name  and recollecting that his indentures were in his box on board  he brought them up  and convinced all present  that he had not assumed a name which did not belong to him —His competitor enraged  that they should hesitate in doing him justice  for to be sure  the warrant had been designed for him  behaved with so much indecent heat  that the commanding officer   who was the same gentleman I had seen  and the surgeon  were offended at his presumption  and making a point of it with their friends in town  in less than a week got the first confirmed in his station —   I have been on board  said he  ever since  and as   229 this way of life is become familiar to me  have no cause to complain
