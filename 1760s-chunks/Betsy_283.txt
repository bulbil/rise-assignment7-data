this time    easily guess at          Some of my readers will  doubtless  think Mrs  Munden entirely justified   in making a secret of the above mentioned letter to her husband  as she   did so in regard to his peace  but others  again  who maintain that   there ought to be no reserve between persons so closely united  will   condemn her for it  I shall forbear to give my vote upon the matter  and   only say  that if she had not acted with less prudence soon after  she   might saved herself a very great shock  and her husband much vexation       It was no more than three days after the great man had dined there  that   Mr  Munden received a billet from him  which contained as follows             To George Munden  Esq            Dear Munden            I have so few days that I can call my own  that I am willing to        make those few as happy as I can  and on that motive desire yours        and your amiable wife s company to dinner with me to morrow  I        leave you to make both my request and compliments acceptable to        her  and am  with all sincerity  dear Munden  yours   c   c                           P S  I shall have a female relation with me  who will rejoice in an        opportunity of becoming acquainted with Mrs  Munden        Mr  Munden desired the servant who brought this  to give his own and   wife s most humble duty to his lord  and assure his lordship they would   not fail to attend his commands       Some friends being with him when this invitation was brought  hindered   him from saying any thing of it at that time to his wife  but they were   no sooner gone  than  with an air and voice elated even to an excess  he   told her of the high favour conferred upon them by his right honourable   patron       Mrs  Munden was now more than ever convinced of the base designs Lord        had upon her  and that the letter she had received was sent by him    she therefore immediately determined within herself to let him see  by   her not complying with this invitation  that she was neither ignorant   what his intentions were  nor would do any thing that might give him the   least encouragement to prosecute them       But as she still judged it was wholly improper to acquaint Mr  Munden   with any thing of the affair  she could form no other contrivance to   avoid accompanying him in this visit  than by pretending herself seized   with a sudden indisposition  which she resolved to do some few hours   before the arrival of that wherein they should set out       If she had persisted in this mind  it would have been highly laudable   indeed  but  alas  the next morning inspired her with very different   sentiments  vanity  that sly subverter of our best resolutions    suggested to her that there was no necessity for her behaving in the   manner she had designed        What should I fear   said she to herself   what danger threatens either   my virtue or my reputation  A wife may certainly go any where with her   husband  besides  a lady will be there  a relation of his lordship s  he   can communicate nothing to me in their presence that I should blush to   hear  and it would be rather ridiculous prudery  than discretion in me    to deny myself the satisfaction of such good company        It must be acknowledged   for it but too plainly appears from every   circumstances of this lady s conduct  both before and after marriage    that the unhappy propensity in her nature for attracting universal   admiration  rendered her little regardful either of the guilt or the   disquiets to which her beauty was accessary  if she was admired and   loved  she cared not to what end  in short  it made her  perfectly   uncorrupted and pure as her own inclinations were  rather triumph in    than regret  the power she had of inspiring the most inordinate and   vicious ones in others       Thus  more delighted than alarmed  she equipped herself with all the   arts and laboured industry of female
