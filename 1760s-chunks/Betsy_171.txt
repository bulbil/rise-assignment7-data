favours as dear as she   can  and to make the best provision she can for herself  because her   subsistence is precarious  and depends wholly on the will of him who   supports her  These  my dear friend   continued he   are truths  which I   hope you will not wait for experience to convince you of        It is probable Mr  Thoughtless did not relish this admonition  he   seemed  however  to take it in good part  and returned for answer  that   he should ever retain the most grateful sense of the kind concern he   expressed for him  and added  that whatever inconveniences he might have   been hurried into  by an inadvertent passion  he should always take care   not to become the dupe of any woman       Mr  Goodman then fell into some discourse concerning the younger Mr    Thoughtless  and the elder telling him  that  by his interest  he   procured a comission for him on very easy terms  that worthy old   gentleman appeared very much pleased  and said  he hoped they would   always live together in that perfect amity which both good policy and   nature demands between persons of the same blood        And now   continued he   I have but one more thing to recommend to you    and that is in relation to your sister Miss Betsy  I doubt not of her   innocence  but I fear her conduct  her youth  her beauty  the gaiety of   her temper  and the little vanities of her sex  are every day exposing   her to temptations fatal to reputation  I wish  therefore  she were well   married  I know not how the courtship of Mr  Trueworth happened to be   broke off  perhaps on some trifling occasion either on the one or the   other side  if so  it is likely Mr  Francis  when he comes to town  may   bring about a reconciliation  According to my judgment of mankind  she   cannot make a more deserving choice  There is another gentleman  who now   makes his addresses to her  whose name is Munden  but I know nothing of   his character  he never applied to me  nor did she consult me on the   affair  it will  however  be a brother s part in you to enquire how far   he may be worthy of her        Perceiving Mr  Thoughtless listened to him with a good deal of   attention  he went on   I should also think it right   said he   that   while she remains in a single state  she should be boarded in some   social  reputable family  I do not like this living by herself  her   humour is too volatile to endure solitude  she must have her amusements    and the want of them at home naturally carries her in search of them   abroad  I could wish   he added   that you would tell her what I have   said to you on this subject  she is convinced I am her friend  I believe   has some regard for me  and  it may be  my dying admonitions will have   greater effect upon her than all she has heard from me before        Mr  Goodman  after this  beginning to grow extremely faint  and   altogether unable to hold any farther discourse  the brother of Miss   Betsy judged it convenient to retire  assuring the other  as he took his   leave  that no part of what he had said should be lost upon him       Though the promise he had made Mr  Goodman was chiefly dictated by his   complaisance  yet it was not wholly forgot after he had left him  As to   what that worthy gentleman had said  in relation to his own manner of   living  he thought he had talked well  but he had talked like an old   man  and that it was time enough for him to part with his pleasures when   he had no longer any inclination to pursue them  but what had been   alledged to him  concerning his sister s conduct  made a much deeper   impression on his mind  he considered  that the honour of a family   depended greatly on the female part of it  and therefore resolved to   omit nothing in his power to prevent Miss Betsy from being caught by any   snares that might be laid to entrap her innocence       He communicated to Mr  Francis Thoughtless  on his arrival  all that Mr    Goodman had said to him on this score  and his own sentiments upon it    that young gentleman was entirely of his brother s opinion in this   point  and they both agreed  that marriage was the only sure
