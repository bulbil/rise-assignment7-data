let him run and play about the garden  and he would have been twenty times more entertaining than our squirrel or monkey  If that be all  says the young coquet  we will fish for him again  If that be all  I ll hold three tooth picks to one pound of snuff  I catch him whenever I please   Accordingly they threw in their line once more  but  with all their gilding  and padling  and assiduity  they could never after catch the Diver  In this state of solitude and disappointment they continued for many years  still fishing  but without success  till  at last  the genius of the place  in pity to their distresses  changed the prude into a shrimp  and the coquet into an oyster   Adieu   LETTER LXXXVI  From the same   I AM amused  my dear Fum  with the labours of some of the learned here  One shall write you a whole folio on the direction of a caterpillar  Another shall swell his works with a description of the plumage on the wing of a butterfly  a third shall see a little world on a peach leaf  and publish a book to describe what his readers might see more clearly in two minutes  only by being furnished with eyes and a microscope   I have frequently compared the understandings of such men to their own glasses  Their field of vision is too contracted to take in the whole of any   103 but minute objects  they view all nature bit by bit  now the proboscis  now the antennae  now the pinnae of—a flea  Now the polypus comes to breakfast upon a worm  now it is kept up to see how long it will live without eating  now it is turned inside outward  and now it sickens and dies  Thus they proceed  laborious in trifles  constant in experiment  without one single abstraction  by which alone knowledge may be properly said to encrease  till  at last  their ideas  ever employed upon minute things  contract to the size of the diminutive object  and a single mite shall fill their whole mind s capacity   Yet believe me  my friend  ridiculous as these men are to the world  they are set up as objects of esteem for each other  They have particular places appointed for their meetings  in which one shews his cockle shell  and is praised by all the society  another produces his powder  makes some experiments that result in nothing  and comes off with admiration and applause  a third comes out with the important discovery of some new process in the skeleton of a mole  and is set down as the accurate and sensible  while one still more fortunate than the rest  by pickling  potting  and preserving monsters  rises into unbounded reputation   The labours of such men  instead of being calculated to amuse the public  are laid out only in diverting each other  The world becomes very little the better or the wiser  for knowing what is the peculiar food of an insect that is itself the food of another  which in its turn is eaten by a third  but there are men who have studied themselves into an habit of investigating and admiring such minutiae  To these such subjects are pleasing  as   104 there are some who contentedly spend whole days in endeavouring to solve aenigmas  or disentangle the puzzling sticks of children   But of all the learned  those who pretend to investigate remote antiquity  have least to plead in their own defence  when they carry this passion to a faulty excess  They are generally found to supply by conjecture the want of record  and then by perseverance are wrought up into a confidence of the truth of opinions  which even to themselves at first appeared founded only in imagination   The Europeans have heard much of the kingdom of China  its politeness  arts  commerce  laws  and morals  are  however  but very imperfectly known among them  They have even now in their Indian warehouse numberless utensils  plants  minerals  and machines  of the use of which they are intirely ignorant  nor can any among them even make a probable guess for what they might have been designed  Yet though this people be so ignorant of the present real state of China  the philosophers I am describing have entered into long  learned  laborious disputes about what China was two thousand years ago  China and European happiness are but little connected even at this day  but European happiness and China two thousand years ago have certainly no connection at all  However  the learned have written on and pursued the subject thro  all the labyrinths of antiquity  though the early dews and the tainted gale be passed away  though no footsteps remain to direct the doubtful chace  yet still they run forward  open upon the uncertain scent  and though in fact they follow nothing  are earnest in the pursuit  In this chace however they   105 all take different ways  One  for example  confidently assures us  that China was peopled by a colony from Egypt  Sesostris  he observes  led his army as far as the Ganges  therefore  if he went so far  he might still have gone as far as China
