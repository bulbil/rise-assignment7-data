 supported them to their own gate  where such an apparition filled all the domestics with astonishment  Mrs  Darnel taking him by the hand  led him into the house  where she welcomed him with another affectionate embrace  and indulged him with an ambrosial kiss of Aurelia  saying   But for you  we had both been by this time in eternity  Sure it was Heaven that sent you as an angel to our assistance   She kindly inquired if he had himself sustained any damage in administering that desperate remedy to which they owed their lives  She entertained him with a small collation  and  in the course of the conversation  lamented the animosity which had so long divided two neighbouring families of such influence and character  He was not slow in signifying his approbation of her remarks  and expressing the most eager desire of seeing all those unhappy differences removed  In a word  they parted with mutual satisfaction    Just as he advanced from the outward gate  on his return to Greavesbury Hall  he was met by Anthony Darnel on horseback  who  riding up to him with marks of surprise and resentment  saluted him with   Your servant  sir —Have you any commands for me   The other replying with an air of indifference   None at all  —Mr  Darnel asked  what had procured him the honour of a visit  The young gentleman  perceiving by the manner in which he spoke  that the old quarrel was not yet extinguished  answered with equal disdain  that the visit was not intended for him  and that  if he wanted to know the cause of it  he might inform himself by his own servants   So I shall   cried the uncle of Aurelia   and perhaps let you know my sentiments of the matter  — Hereafter as it may be   said the youth  who  turning out of the avenue  walked home  and made his father acquainted with the particulars of this adventure    The old gentleman chid him for his rashness  but seemed pleased with the success of his attempt  and still more so  when he understood his sentiments of Aurelia  and the deportment of the ladies    Next day the son sent over a servant with a compliment to inquire about their health  and the messenger  being seen by Mr  Darnel  was told that the ladies were indisposed  and did not choose to be troubled with messages  The mother was really seized with a fever  produced by the agitation of her spirits  which every day became more and more violent  until the physicians despaired of her life  Believing that her end approached  she sent a trusty servant to Mr  Greaves  desiring that she might see him without delay  and he immediately set out with the messenger  who introduced him in the dark    He found the old lady in bed almost exhausted  and the fair Aurelia sitting by her overwhelmed with grief  her lovely hair in the utmost disorder  and her charming eyes inflamed with weeping  The good lady beckoning Mr  Launcelot to approach  and directing all the attendants to quit the room  except a favourite maid  from whom I learned the story  she took him by the hand  and fixing her eyes upon him with all the fondness of a mother  shed some tears in silence  while the same marks of sorrow trickled down his cheeks  After this affecting pause   My dear son   said she   Oh  that I could have lived to see you so indeed  you find me hastening to the goal of life   Here the tender hearted Aurelia  being unable to contain herself longer  broke out into a violent passion of grief  and wept aloud  The mother  waiting patiently till she had thus given vent to her anguish  calmly entreated her to resign herself submissively to the will of Heaven  then turning to Mr  Launcelot   I had indulged   said she   a fond hope of seeing you allied to my family  This is no time for me to insist upon the ceremonies and forms of a vain world  Aurelia looks upon you with the eyes of tender prepossession   No sooner had she pronounced these words than he threw himself on his knees before the young lady  and pressing her hand to his lips  breathed the softest expressions which the most delicate love could suggest   I know   resumed the mother   that your passion is mutually sincere  and I should die satisfied if I thought your union would not be opposed  but that violent man  my brother in law  who is Aurelia s sole guardian  will thwart her wishes with every obstacle that brutal resentment and implacable malice can contrive  Mr  Greaves  I have long admired your virtues  and am confident that I can depend upon your honour  You shall give me your word  that when I am gone you will take no steps in this affair without the concurrence of your father  and endeavour  by all fair and honourable means  to vanquish the prejudices  and obtain the consent of her uncle  the rest we must leave to the dispensation of Providence     The squire promised  in the
