Grandison saw me a little uneasy  and came up to us  Mr  Grandison  said she  I thought you had known Miss Byron s character by this time  She is something more than a pretty woman  She has a soul  Sir  The man who makes a compliment to her on her beauty  depreciates her understanding     104 She then led me to her seat  and sat down next me   Mr  Grandison was in the midst of a fine speech  and was not well pleased  He sat down  threw one leg over the knee of the other  hemm d three or four times  took out his snuff box  tapped it  let the snuff drop thro  his singers  then broke the lumps  then shut it  and twirled it round with the fore finger of his right hand  as he held it between the thumb and forefinger of the other  and was quite like a sullen boy  Yet  after a while  tried to recover himself  by forcing a laugh at a slight thing or two said in company  that was not intended to raise one   I think  my dear  I could have allowed a little more for him  had not his name been Grandison   We soon adjusted every thing for the little journey  Mr  Grandison told Miss Grandison  that if she would make him amends for her treatment of him just now  she should put Lord L  upon inviting him  Lord and Lady L  joined to do so  But Miss Grandison would not admit of his going  and I was glad of it   But  not to affront you  cousin  said she  Miss Byron and I want to have a good deal of particular conversation  So shall not be able to spare you an hour of our company at Colnebrooke  But one thing  Sir  My brother sets out for Canterbury to morrow  Tell him  that we won t be troubled with your company  Ask him  if he will   Not in those words neither  cousin Charlotte  But I will offer my attendance  and if he accepts of it  I shall be half as happy as if I went to Colnebrooke  and only half  bowing to me   Why  now  you are a good docible kind of man  I want to hear what will be my brother s answer  For we know not one syllable  nor can guess at his business at Canterbury   The tea equi being brought in  we heard Sir Charles s voice  complimenting a lady to her chair  and who pleaded engagement for declining to drink   105 tea with his sister  And then he enter d the parlour to us  He addressed my cousins  who were next him  with his usual politeness  He then came to me  How does my good Miss Byron  Not discomposed  I hope by your yesterday s visitors  They are all of them in love with you  But you must have been pained—I was pained for you  when I heard they had visited you  But extraordinary merit has some forfeitures to pay   I am sure then  thought I  you must have a great many  Every time I see him  I think he rises upon me in the gracefulness of his behaviour   I have one agreeable piece of news to tell you  madam  Sir Hargrave will go abroad for a twelvemonth  He says  he cannot be in the same kingdom with you  and not see you  He hopes therefore to lessen the torment  by flying from the temptation  Mr  Bagenhall and Mr  Merceda will go with him   Then whispering me  he said  from an hint in the letter of the penitent Wilson  that Mr  Bagenhall s circumstances are not happy  and that he is too much in the power of Sir Hargrave  I have prevailed on the latter  in consideration of the other s accompanying him abroad  to make him easy  And  would you believe it  and can you forgive me —I have brought Sir Hargrave to give Wilson the promised 100 l  To induce him to do this  Merceda  influenced by the arguments I urged  founded on the unhappy fellow s confessions in that letter  offer d 50 l  more for his past services to himself  And both  as a proof of the sincerity of their promised reformation  Wilson shall not have the money  but upon his marrying the girl to whom he is contracted  And on my return from a little excursion I am making to Canterbury  I shall put all in a train  And now  let me ask you  once more  can you forgive me for rewarding  as you may think it  a base servant   O Sir  how can I answer you —You told me at   106 Colnebrooke  that we were to endeavour to bring good out of the evil from which you had deliver d me  This indeed is making your words true in a very extensive sense  To make your enemies your friends  to put wicked men into a way of reformation  and to make it a bad man s interest to be good—Forgive you  Sir —From what I remember of
