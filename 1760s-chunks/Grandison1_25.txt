 must take care how they laugh with him  For he makes ungenerous constructions to the disadvantage of a woman whom he can bring to seem pleas d with   57 his jests  I will tell you hereafter  how I came to know this  and even worse  of him   The taste of the present age seems to be dress  No wonder  therefore  that such a man as Sir Hargrave aims to excel in it  What can be misbestowed by a man on his person  who values it more than his mind  But he would  in my opinion  better become his dress  if the pains he undoubtedly takes before he ventures to come into public  were less apparent  This I judge from his solicitude to preserve all in exact order  when in company  for he forgets not to pay his respects to himself at every glass  yet does it with a seeming consciousness  as if he would hide a vanity too apparent to be concealed  breaking from it  if he finds himself observed  with an half careless  yet seemingly dissatisfied air  pretending to have discovered something amiss in himself  This seldom fails to bring him a compliment  Of which he shews himself very sensible  by affectedly disclaiming the merit of it  perhaps with this speech  bowing  with his spread hand on his breast  waving his head to and fro—By my Soul  Madam  or Sir  you do me too much honour   Such a man is Sir Hargrave Pollexfen  He placed himself next to the country girl  and laid himself out in fine speeches to her  running on in such a manner  that I had not for some time an opportunity to convince him that I had been in company of gay people before  He would have it  that I was a perfect beauty  and he supposed me very young—Very silly of course  And gave himself such airs  as if he were sure of my admiration   I viewed him steadily several times  and my eye once falling under his  as I was looking at him  I dare say  he at that moment pitied the poor fond heart  which he supposed was in tumults about him  when  at the very time  I was considering  whether  if I were obliged to have the one or the other  as a punishment for some great fault I had committed  my choice would   58 fall on Mr  Singleton  or on him  I mean  supposing the former were not a remarkably obstinate man  since obstinacy in a weak man  I think  must be worse than tyranny in a man of sense—If indeed a man of sense can be a tyrant   A summons to dinner relieved me from his more particular addresses  and placed him at a distance from me   Sir Hargrave  the whole time of dinner  received advantage from the supercilious looks and behaviour of Mr  Walden  who seemed  on every thing the Baronet said   and he was seldom silent  half to despise him  for he made at times so many different mouths of contempt  that I thought it was impossible for the same features to express them  I have been making mouths in the glass for several minutes  to try to recover some of Mr  Walden s  in order to describe them to you  Lucy  but I cannot for my life so distort my face as to enable me to give you a notion of one of them   He might perhaps have been better justified in some of his contempts  had it not been visible  that the consequence which he took from the Baronet  he gave to himself  and yet was as censurable one way  as Sir Hargrave was the other   Mirth  however insipid  will occasion smiles  tho  sometimes to the disadvantage of the mirthful  But gloom  severity  moroseness  will always disgust  tho  in a Solomon  Mr  Walden had not been taught that  And indeed it might seem a little ungrateful  Don t you think so  Lucy   if women failed to reward a man with their smiles  who scrupled not to make himself a—monkey  shall I say   to please them   Never before did I see the difference between the man of the Town  and the man of the College  displayed in a light so striking as in these two gentlemen in the conversation after dinner  The one   59 seemed resolved not to be pleased  while the other laid himself out to please every body  and that in a manner so much at his own expence  as frequently to bring into question his understanding  By a second silly thing he banish d the remembrance of a first  by a third the second  and so on  And by continually laughing at his own absurdities  left us at liberty to suppose that his folly was his choice  and that  had it not been to divert the company  he could have made a better figure   Mr  Walden  as was evident by his scornsul brow  by the contemptuous motions of his lip  and by his whole face affectedly turn d from the Baronet  grudged him the smile that sat upon everyone s countenance  and for which
