you did give such orders  after you had run us foul of  a post  so as that the carriage lay along  and could not right  herself     I run you foul of a post   cried the commander   d   my  heart  you re a pretty dog  an t you  to tell me so above board to my  face  Did I take charge of the chaise  Did I stand at the helm     No    answered Hatchway   I must confess you did not steer  but  howsomever   you cunned all the way  and so  as you could not see how the land lay   being blind of your larboard eye  we were fast ashore before you knew  anything of the matter  Pipes  who stood abaft  can testify the truth of  what I say     D   my limbs   resumed the commodore   I don t value what  you or Pipes say a rope yarn  You re a couple of mutinous  I ll say no  more  but you shan t run your rig upon me  d   ye  I am the man that    6 22 15  3 45 PM   learnt you  Jack Hatchway  to splice a rope and raise a perpendicular    The lieutenant  who was perfectly well acquainted with the trim of his  captain  did not choose to carry on the altercation any further   but taking up his can  drank to the health of the stranger  who very  courteously returned the compliment  without  however  presuming to join  in the conversation  which suffered a considerable pause  During this  interruption  Mr  Hatchway s wit displayed itself in several practical  jokes upon the commodore  with whom he knew it was dangerous to tamper  in any other way  Being without the sphere of his vision  he securely  pilfered his tobacco  drank his rumbo  made wry faces  and  to use the  vulgar phrase  cocked his eye at him  to the no small entertainment of  the spectators  Mr  Pickle himself not excepted  who gave evident tokens  of uncommon satisfaction at the dexterity of this marine p pantomime   Meanwhile  the captain s choler gradually subsided  and he was pleased  to desire Hatchway  by the familiar and friendly diminutive of Jack   to read a newspaper that lay on the table before him  This task was  accordingly undertaken by the lame lieutenant  who  among paragraphs   read that which follows  with an elevation of voice which seemed to  prognosticate something extraordinary   We are informed  that Admiral  Bower will very soon be created a British peer  for his eminent services  during the war  particularly in his late engagement with the French  fleet    Trunnion was thunderstruck at this piece of intelligence  the ring  dropped front his hand  and shivered into a thousand pieces  his eye  glistened like that of a rattle snake  and some minutes elapsed before  he could pronounce   Avast  overhaul that article again    It was no sooner read the second time  than  smiting the table with his  fist  he started up  and  with the most violent emphasis of rage and  indignation  exclaimed   D   my heart and liver   tis a land lie  d ye  see  and I will maintain it to be a lie  from the sprit sail yard to the  mizen top sail haulyards  Blood and thunder  Will  Bower a peer of this  realm  a fellow of yesterday  that scarce knows a mast from a manger   a snotty nose boy  whom I myself have ordered to the gun  for stealing  eggs out of the hen coops  and I  Hawser Trunnion  who commanded a  ship before he could keep a reckoning  am laid aside  d ye see  and  forgotten  If so be as this be the case  there is a rotten plank in our  constitution  which ought to be hove down and repaired  d   my eyes  For  my own part  d ye see  I was none of your Guinea pigs  I did not rise in  the service by parlamenteering interest  or a handsome b   of a wife   I was not over the bellies of better men  nor strutted athwart the  quarter deck in a laced doublet  and thingumbobs at the wrists  D   my  limbs  I have been a hard working man  and served all offices on board  from cook s shifter to the command of a vessel  Here  you Tunley   there s the hand of a seaman  you dog    So saying  he laid hold on the landlord s fist  and honoured him with  such a squeeze  as compelled him to roar with great vociferation  to  the infinite satisfaction of the commodore  whose features were a little  unblended by this acknowledgment of his vigour  and he thus proceeded   in a less outrageous strain   They make a d
