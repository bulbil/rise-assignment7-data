could have swallowed him at one  mouthful  but he thought he might venture to challenge him  in hopes of  being put under arrest by the general  Though he reckoned without his  host  Lord Stair knew his disposition  and  in order to punish his  presumption  winked at the affair  The challenger  finding himself  mistaken in his conjecture  got up early in the morning  and went off  post for Vienna  And Lord Stair desired a certain man of quality to make  me a visit  and give me an account of his behaviour    Being now deprived of my protection and pin money  which my generous  husband would no longer pay  I was reduced to great difficulty and  distress  The duchess d Aremberg  Lord G    and many other persons of  distinction  interceded in my behalf with his Majesty  who was then  abroad  but he refused to interpose between man and wife  The countess  of Calemberg wrote a letter to my father  in which she represented my  uncomfortable situation  and undertook to answer for my conduct  in case  he would allow me a small annuity  on which I could live independent  of Lord     who  by all accounts  was a wretch with whom I could never  enjoy the least happiness or quiet  otherwise she would be the first  to advise me to an accommodation  She gave him to understand  that her  character was neither doubtful nor obscure  and that  if my conduct  there had not been irreproachable  she should not have taken me under  her protection  That  as I proposed to board in a convent  a small  sum would answer my occasions  but  if that should be denied  I would  actually go to service  or take some other desperate step  to avoid the  man who was my bane and aversion    To this kind remonstrance my father answered that his fortune would not  allow him to assist me  he had now a young family  and that I ought   at all events  to return to my husband  By this time  such was the  extremity of my circumstances  that I was forced to pawn my clothes  and  every trifling trinket in my possession  and even to descend so far as  to solicit Mr  S   for a loan of fifty pounds  which he refused  Thus  was I deserted in my distress by two persons  to whom  in the season  of my affluence  my purse had been always open  Nothing so effectually  subdues a spirit unused to supplicate  as want  Repulsed in this manner   I had recourse to Lord B    who was also  it seems  unable to relieve my  necessities  This mortification I deserved at his hands  though he had  once put it in my power to be above all such paltry applications  and I  should not have been compelled to the disagreeable task of troubling my  friends  had not I voluntarily resigned what he formerly gave me  As to  the other gentleman to whom I addressed myself on this occasion  I  think he might have shown more regard to my situation  not only for  the reasons already mentioned  but because he knew me too well to be  ignorant of what I must have suffered in condescending to make such a  request    Several officers  who guessed my adversity  generously offered to  supply me with money  but I could not bring myself to make use of their    6 22 15  3 45 PM   friendship  or even to own my distress  except to one person  of whom I  borrowed a small sum  To crown my misfortunes  I was taken very ill   at a time when there was no other way of avoiding the clutches of my  persecutor but by a precipitate flight  In this emergency  I applied  to a worthy gentleman of Brussels  a very good friend of mine  but no  lover  I say no lover  because every man is supposed to act in that  capacity who befriends a young woman in distress  This generous Fleming  set out with me in the night from Brussels  and conducted me to the  frontier of France  Being very much indisposed both in mind and body  when I was obliged to undertake this expedition  I should in all  probability have sunk under the fatigue of travelling  had not my  spirits been kept up by the conversation of my companion  who was a man  of business and consequence  and undertook to manage my affairs in such  a manner as would enable me to re establish my residence in the place I  had left  He was young and active  attended me with the utmost care and  assiduity  and left nothing undone which he thought would contribute to  my ease and satisfaction  I believe his friendship for me was a little  tinctured with another passion  but he was married  and lived very well  with his wife  who was also my friend  so that he knew I would never  think of him in
