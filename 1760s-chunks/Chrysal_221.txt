states in   some inconveniences  they find these will rather submit to this gross   imposition  than suffer them to be swallowed up by others  who   would grow too powerful by this accretion      Base as such a prostitution of principle must appear  it has been   so successfully practised  and this not by those poor princes alone    the Austrians and Spaniards occasionally  and the Dutch constantly   availing themselves of it   that England in particular has been drawn   in to bear a part  from which  by her situation  she seemed exempted   by Heaven in every war that has distracted Europe for some ages    to an expense of blood and treasure  which is already severely felt     and must  if pursued much further  involve it in the very ruin it   thus strives to avert      There is one  and one only remedy for this   but this is attended   with difficulties  which will prevent its being applied  till the evil   itself shall work its own redress  a period that  to human foresight    seems not far distant at present  This is taking away the power   of these petty tyrants  who disgrace the name of sovereign  and   uniting their territories into one state  of strength sufficient ta   support itself  For  while those princes have any power left  they   will  consistently with their present systems of policy  oppose this     but the manner in which they have conducted themselves in this   war  if not speedily altered  will so effectually reduce that power     that they will be no longer able to resist  but must passively submit   to the dominion of whoever will undertake their support  an event   as much to be desired by their own immediate subjects  as by the   other states  which thus suffer by their absurd and iniquitous con    duct  as the severest form of one government is preferable to the   capricious rule of several tyrants  whose poverty and pride put   them upon every method of making the most of their wretched   people  without any regard to the established rules of justice  or   even the common rights of humanity  The usual objection   to this expedient  of its overturning the liberty of Germany    which they make so great a noise about  ia of no weight  that boasted          252 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     liberty being  at preseat  no more than the power of those sovereigns   to treat their subjects as they please  with impunity  the restraining   of which within just bounds would really be establishing  not   overturning  the liberty of mankind      As to the war in which the English were at this time engaged    it was not to be ascribed solely to this cause  The insatiable am    bition of the French had prompted them to strive for the enlarge    ment of their territories in America  where they already possessed   a hundred times more than they were able to make any use of    The possessions of the English in that part of the globe were also   uselessly extensive  However  the boundaries having been settled   between them  usurpations were not to be tolerated  consistently   with the honour of the state   besides  if they were taken no notice   of in the beginning  they might  in time  possibly be extended to the   profitable and inhabited parts of their dominions  On this account   a war was kindled between those powerful and jealous neighbours    the seat of which was properly transferred by the English to the   place in which the attack had been made upon them  where the   superiority of their naval force gave them such advantages  that   they  not only recovered the places which had been taken from   them  but also absolutely overturned the French power in those   boundless regions  and pursued their conquests in every other part   of the world where the French had made settlements  to the utter   ruin of their naval power and trade       As it was impossible for the French to recover these losses directly    and the ambition and avarice which first gave occasion to the war   was strengthened by pride  to prevent their making the concessions   on which they might have obtained peace  they removed the seat   of the war into Germany  and attacked certain powers there  with   whom England was so inseparably connected  that it could not avoid   flying to their assistance  in expectation of having all their own   losses restored  in return for those territories  if they could get   possession of them  which the number of their own land forces  and   the alliances they knew they could make among the venal Germans    gave them
