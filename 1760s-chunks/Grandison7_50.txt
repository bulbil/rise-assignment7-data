as I may seem  by the step I have taken    126 to have had for my own honour  I would avoid  if possible  suffering a first error to draw me into a second  Do you Sir  as my brother and friend  take care of that honour in every step you shall advise me to take   Your honour  madam  shall be my first care  I sincerely think this is the rightest measure you can now pursue   Now pursue —sighing   This argument admitted of a short debate  She was scrupulous from motives too narrow for a Clementina to mention  I made her blush for mentioning them  and  in short  had the happiness to convince her  that the protection of the sister of her fourth brother was the most proper she could choose   I went down  and talked to the gentlewomen below  They were pleased with what I said to them  They prayed for the Lady and her family  and for a happy reconciliation between them  for Antony had given them briefly her story   I requested them to make my compliments to her relation Captain Henderson  and desire him to give me an opportunity to thank him in person for his civility to a Lady beloved by all who have the honour of knowing her   I went up again to the Lady  and sat with her most of the evening  Laura only attending us   I talked to Clementina of Mrs  Beaumont  and the Ladies at Florence  and intimated  that her mother had prevailed on that Lady to come to England  in hopes  as she is an English woman  that her company would be highly acceptable to her  She blessed her mother  What an instance of forgiving goodness was this  she said  with tears of gratitude  and blessed Mrs  Beaumont for her goodness to her  and the Ladies at Florence for parting with one so dear to them   I was happy throughout this latter conversation in   127 her serenity  not one instance of wandering did I observe   I chose not  however  so early  to acquaint her  with the intention of the dearest and nearest of her friends  to come over with Mrs  Beaumont  tho  I expressed my earnest hope  that if we could make England agreeable to her  I should have the honour of the promised visit from some of the principals of her family  before she left it   This  my dearest Life  is a minute account of our interview  One of the greatest Pleasures I can know is to obey the gentle  the generous commands of my Harriet   This morning I attended Lady L  to breakfast with the excellent Lady  as proposed  My Sister and her Lord are charmed with their guest  Their guest she is  And Lady Clementina is as much pleased with them  She is every hour more and more sensible of the danger she has run  and censures herself very freely for the rash step  as she calls it herself   She longs  yet is ashamed to see you  my dearest life  and listens with delight to the praises my Lord and Lady L  so justly give to my Harriet   Monday afternoon   I HAVE introduced Lord and Lady G  to Lady Clementina  at her own request  being assured  she said  that the place of her refuge would be kept secret by all my friends  Both sister  occasionally joining in praising my angel  How happy  said she  are those marriages which give as much joy to the relations on both sides as to the parties themselves   Adieu  my dearest Love  With the tenderest affection I am  and ever will be   Your most faithful and obliged CH  GRANDISON     128  LETTER XXVII  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  In Continuation   Thursday  Feb  22   WE are as happy here  as we can expect to be  Lady Clementina in her state of suspense and apprehension  I without my Harriet   You hinted to me once  my Love  something of our Beauchamp s regard for Emily  He just now  after more hesitations than I expected from my friend  opened his heart to me  and asked me to countenance his addresses to her  I chid him for his hesitation—and then said  Is my Beauchamp in this proposition so right as he generally is —Emily  tho  tall and womanly  is very young  I am not a friend to very early marriages  You know as well as any man  my dear friend  the reasons that may be urged against such  Methinks I would give Emily an opportunity  as well for her husband s sake  whoever shall be the man  as for her own  to look round her  and make her own choice  The merit of Sir Edward Beauchamp  his personal accomplishments  and character  to say nothing of his now ample fortune  must make his addresses to any woman acceptable  You would not  I presume  think of marrying her  if you might  till she is eighteen or twenty  And would my Beauchamp fetter himself  by engagements to a girl  and leave her who at present can hardly give him
