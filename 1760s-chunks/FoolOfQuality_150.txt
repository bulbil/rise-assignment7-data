 yet he could scarce   conceive how a child  little more than eight years of age  should be   capable of contriving mischiefs so formidable in their execution    and so extensive in their consequences  Now Ned was so happy    on this singular occasion  that nothing transpired   wherefore  as   Mr  Fenton could produce no manner of proof  he was too delicate to   ask any questions on the case   lest  on one hand  he should tempt   the boy into a lie  or  on the other  be obliged to chastise or check   him for faults that his generosity might induce him to confess      Matters  therefore  with respect to Ned  preserved their state of   tranquillity   though Mr  Fenton would often view him with an eye   of wonder and suspicion  and could hardly bring himself to believe   that a boy of his extraordinary genius should be no other by birth   than a beggar s brat  But here pardon me  Mr  Fenton  if I dissent   from your opinion  With humble deference to your judgment in   other matters  I conceive that an infant begot on a dunghill    brought forth in a pigsty  and swathed with the rotten remnant   of the covering of an ass  may have talents and capacity above   the son of an emperor      Friend  The singularity of your sentiments often strikes me   with astonishment  Do you really think in a way apart from all   other people  or is it a distinction that you affect  Here you set   yourself at fisticuffs with universal persuasion  with historical facts    and with the experience as well as opinion of all ages  You seem   wholly to have forgot the circumstances that attended the birth   and discovery of Cyrus  of  Edipus  of Eomulus and Kemus  with a   thousand other instances   whereby it is evident that the beauty    prowess  and virtues of great and glorious ancestors naturally   devolve upon their offspring      Author  The great Teutonic theosopher  Jacob Behmen  affirms    that a father begets the soul as well as body of his child   and this   strongly coincides with your judgment of the matter  All animal   nature also concurs in the same position  and the offspring of a   lion  an eagle  and an ass  invariably partake of the qualities of   their progenitors      In the very early ages of mankind  when honour and empire    precedence and station  were assigned to superior merit alone  to   prowess in the field  or wisdom in the council   it is but natural   to suppose that the more immediate descendants of such heroes or   patriots inherited in a great measure the beauty  strength  genius                THE FOOL OF QUALITY  143     and disposition of those from whom they sprung  But some   thousands of years are now passed  my good sir  since all this matter   has been totally reversed  and the world affords but very rare   intances where washerwomen or shepherds  where a Catherine of   Russia  or Kouli Kan of Persia  or Theodore of Corsica  by the   mere force of genius  have raised themselves from obscurity to   dominion  These instances also are very far from making any thing   in favour of your argument   though  unquestionably  were you to   write their romance  you would  agreeaMe to your thesis  derive   their respective pedigree from the queens of  Utopia  or some   emperors in terra australis incognita      When time was young  when men were respected and advanced    as I said  according to their personal distinctions and accomplish    ments  uncommon beauty  strength  and agility of body  informed   by superior genius and talents  were accounted genuine proofs of   a royal or noble descent  but in process of years  when art had   introduced luxury  and luxury had introduced corruption among   the great  a feeble distempered frame  informed by a perverse  pusil    lanimous  and impatient temper  became an indication by no means   improbable of the genuine descent of a child of quality      Friend  My dear friend  be cautious  to speak lightly or de    gradingly of dignity and station does not become people of a   certain sphere      Author  With all deference and due submission to those who sit   in the seat of Moses  or in the throne of Caesar  when we speak as   philosophers we should speak independent of vulgar prejudice      I am not insensible of that internal respect which the world is   pleased to pay to external lustre  If one man acquires a
