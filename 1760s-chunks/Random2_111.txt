his power to make my fortune any other way than by encouraging me to trade  which I had not long prosecuted when my patron died  and I found myself in the midst of strangers  without one friend to support or protect me  urged by this consideration  I sold my effects and removed to this country  the governour of which having been appointed by the Vice roy  was my intimate acquaintance —Here has heaven prospered my endeavours  during a residence of sixteen years  in which my tranquillity was never invaded  but by the remembrance of your mother  whose death I have in secret mourned without ceasing  and the reflection of you  whose sate I could never learn  notwithstanding all my inquiries  by means of my friends in France  who  after the most strict examination  could give me no other account  than that you went abroad six years ago  and was never after heard of —I could not rest satisfied with this imperfect information  and though my hope of finding you was   335 but languid  resolved to go in quest of you in person  for which purpose  I have remitted to Holland the value of twenty thousand pound  and am in possession of fifteen thousand more  with which I intended to embark myself on board of captain Bowling  before I discovered this amazing stroke of providence  which you may be sure has not altered my intention      My father having entertained us with this agreeable sketch of his life  withdrew in order to relieve Don Antonio  who in his absence  had done the honours of his house  and I was just dressed for my appearance among the guests  when Strap arrived from the ship   He no sooner entered the grand apartment  in which I was  and saw the magnificence of my apparel  than his speech was lost in amazement  and he gaped in silence at the objects that surrounded him —I took him by the hand  observed that I had sent for him to be a witness and sharer of my happiness  and told him I had found a father —At these words he started  and after having continued some minutes with his mouth and eyes wide open  cried     Aha —odd  I know what  go thy ways  poor Narcissa  and go thy ways somebody else—well—Lord  what a thing is love —God help us  are all our mad pranks and protestations come to this  what  and you have fixed your habitation in this distant land  God prosper you—I find we must part at last—for I would not leave my poor carcass so far from my native home  for all the wealth of the universe    With these ejaculations  he began to sob and make wry faces  upon which I assured him of his mistake    336 both in regard to Narcissa  and my staying in Paraguay  and informed him as briefly as I could  of the great event which had happened —Never was rapture more ludicrously expressed  than in the behaviour of this worthy creature  who cried  laughed  whistled  sung and danced  all in a breath  his transport was scarce over  when my father entered  who no sooner understood that this was Strap  than he took him by the hand  saying    Is this the honest man  who befriended you so much in your distress  your are welcome to my house  and I shall soon put it in the power of my son to reward you for your good offices in his behalf  in the mean time  go with us and partake of the repast that is provided    Strap  wild as he was with joy  would by no means accept of the profered honour  crying    God forbid  I know my distance—your worship shall excuse me    And Don Rodriguez finding his modesty invincible  recommended him to his Major Domo  to be treated with the utmost respect  while he carried me into a large saloon  where I was presented to a numerous company  who loaded me with compliments and caresses  and congratulated my father in terms not proper for me to repeat     Without specifying the particulars of our entertainment  let it suffice to say  it was at the same time elegant and sumptuous  and the rejoicing lasted two days  After which  Don Rodriguez settled his affairs  converted his effects into silver and gold  visited and took leave of all his friends  who were grieved at his departure  and honoured me with considerable presents  and   337 coming on board of my uncle s ship  with the first favourable wind we sailed from the Rio de la Plato  and in two months came safe to an anchor in the harbour of Kingston in the island of Jamaica   CHAP  LXVII    I visit my old friend Thomson—we set sail for Europe  meet with an odd adventure—arrive in England—I ride across the country from Portsmouth to Sussex—converse with Mrs  Sagely  who informs me of Narcissa s being in London—in consequence of this intelligence  I proceed to Canterbury—meet with my old friend Morgan—arrive at London—visit Narcissa—introduce my father to her—he is charmed with her good sense and beauty—we come to a determination of demanding her brother s consent to our marriage   I Enquired  as
