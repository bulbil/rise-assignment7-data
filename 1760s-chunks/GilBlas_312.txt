her brightness  in the meridian sunshine of her wedding finery  One would have fancied she had been clothed in silks  jewels  and fine linen from her cradle  by the dignity of her air and the ease of her deportment   The happy moment which was to unite two fond lovers in the bands of Hymen being arrived  Don Alphonso took me by the hand and led me to the altar  while Seraphina conferred the like honour on the bride elect  Our procession had marched in fit and decent order through the hamlet to the chapel  where the vicar general was waiting to go through the service  and the ceremony was performed amidst the heartfelt congratulations of the inhabitants  and of all the wealthy farmers in the neighbourhood  whom Basil had invited to Antonia s wedding  Their daughters too came in their train  tricked out in ribbons and in flowers  and dancing to the music of their own tambourines  We returned to the mansion under the same escort  and there  by the provident attentions of Scipio  who officiated as high steward and master of the ceremonies  we found three tables set out  one for the principals of the party  another for their household  and the third  which was by far the largest  for all invited guests promiscuously  Antonia was at the first  the governor s lady having made a point of it  I did the honours of the second  and Basil was placed at the head of that where the country people dined  As for Scipio  he never sat down  but was here  there  and everywhere  fetching and carrying  changing plates and filling bumpers  urging the company to call freely for what they wanted  and egging them on to mirth and jollity   The entertainment had been prepared by the governor s cooks  and that is as much as to say  that there were all the delicacies imaginable  in season or out of season  The good wines laid in for me by master Joachim  were set running at a furious rate  the guests were beginning to feel their jovial influence  pleasantry and repartee gave a zest and conviviality  when on a sudden our harmony was interrupted by an alarming occurrence  My secretary  being in the hall where I was dining with Don Alphonso s principal officers and Seraphina s women  suddenly fainted  I started up and ran to his assistance  and while I was employed in bringing him about  one of the women was taken ill also  It was evident to the whole company that this sympathetic malady must involve some mysterious incident  as in effect it turned out almost immediately  that thereby hung a tale  for Scipio soon recovered  and said to me in a low voice  Why must one man s meat be another man s poison  and the most auspicious of your days the curse of mine  But every man bears the bundle of his sins upon his back  and my pack saddle is once more thrown across my shoulders in the person of my wife   Powers of mercy  exclaimed I  this can never be  it is all a romance  What  you the husband of that lady whose nerves were so affected by the disturbance  Yes  sir  answered he  I am her husband  and fortune  if you will take the word of a sinner  could not have done me a dirtier office than by conjuring up such a grievance as this  I know not  my friend  replied I  what reasons you may have for thus belabouring your rib with wordy buffets  but however she may be to blame  in mercy keep a bridle on your tongue  if you have any regard for me  do not displace the mirth and spoil the pleasure of this nuptial meeting  by ominous disorder or enraged questions of past injuries  You shall have no reason to complain on that score  rejoined Scipio  but shall see presently whether I am not a very apt dissembler   With this assurance he went forward to his wife  whom her companions had also brought back to life and recollection  and  embracing her with as much apparent fervour as if his raptures had been real  Ah  my dear Beatrice  said he  heaven has at length united us again after ten years of cruel separation  But this blissful moment is well purchased by whole ages of torturing suspense  I know not  answered his spouse  whether you really are at all the happier for having recovered a part of yourself  but of this at least I am fully certain  that you never had any reason to run away from me as you did  A fine story indeed  You found me one night with Signor Don Ferdinand de Leyva  who was in love with my mistress Julia  and consulted me on the subject of his passion  and only for that  you must take it into your stupid head  that I was caballing with him against your honour and my own  thereupon that poor brain of yours was turned with jealousy  you quitted Toledo in a huff  and ran away from your own flesh and blood as you would from a monster of the deserts  without leaving word why or wherefore  Now which of us two  be so good as to tell me  has most
