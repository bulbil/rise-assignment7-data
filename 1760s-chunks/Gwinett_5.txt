as they were coming up from the port  to the Governor s house  I thought something struck me  in the face of one of the prisoners  that I had before been acquainted with  I could not then stop them for us to speak together  but in about an hour after  they were all brought to the prison  there to be lodged till the Governor signified his further pleasure   As soon as the poor creatures found I was an Englishman  they were extremely happy  even in their distressed situation  though indeed they were treated with lenity enough  and only sent to the prison till a lodging could be provided for them  they having been in the course of the War  made prisoners as well as myself  and then on their return home  I now had an opportunity of taking notice of the man whose face I thought I knew  and I was more and more confirmed that I was not mistaken  And I verily thought  that this was the man  for whose supposed murder I suffered so much in England  and the thought being strong in my head  I could not sleep all night     13The morning after their arrival  I told them  that if any of them had a mind to go about the town I would procure them permission  and go with them  This man said he would go  and it was as I wished  Three other prisoners that went along with us  walked a little in advance  I then took the opportunity  and looking in his face  Sir  said I  was you ever at Deal  I believe  he  at that instant had some recollection of me  for  putting his hand on my shoulder  tears burst into his eyes  Sir  said I  if you are the man I take you for  you here see before you one of the most unfortunate of human kind  Sir  is your name Richard Collins  He replied  Yes  Then cried I  I was hanged and gibbeted upon your account in England   After our first salutation and mutual surprize in meeting being over  he made me give him a circumstantial detail of every thing that happened to me in England  from the moment we parted  I never see any man express such concern as he did  while I was pursuing my melancholy adventures  but  when I came to the circumstance of my being hanged  and afterwards hung in chains  I could hardly prevail upon him to believe my relation  till backed by the most solemn asseverations  pronounced in the most serious manner  When I had done  Well  said he  young man   for I was then but in my 25th year  Mr  Collins might be about three and forty  if you have sustained misfortunes on my account  do not imagine  though I cannot lay them at your door  that I have been without my sufferings  God knows my heart  I am most exceedingly sorry for the injustice that has been done you  but the ways of providence are unsearchable  He then informed me by what accident all my troubles had been brought about     14When you left me in bed  said he  having at first waked with an oppression I could not account for  I found myself exceedingly sick and weak  I groaned and sighed  and thought myself going to die  when  accidentally putting my hand to my left arm  in which I had been blooded the morning before  I found my shirt wet  and in short  that the bandage having slipped  the orifice was again opened  and a great flux of blood ensued  This immediately accounted for the condition I found myself in  I thought however  I would not disturb the family  which had gone to bed very late  I therefore mustered all my strength and got up  with my night gown loose about me  in order to go to a neighbouring barber  who had bled me  and have him to tie up my arm  He lived directly opposite to our house  but when I got in the street  and crossed the way  in order to knock at his door  a band of men armed with cutlasses and hangers  came and siezed me  and hurried me to the beach  I begged and prayed  but they soon silenced my cries  by clapping a gag in my mouth  At first  I took them for a press gang  though I soon found they were a gang of ruffians belonging to a privateer  aboard which they immediately brought me  But before I got thither  loss of blood occasioned me to faint away  The surgeon of the ship  I suppose  tied up my arm  for when my senses returned  I found myself in a hammock  and somebody feeling my pulse  The vessel being then under way  I asked where I was  They said I was safe enough  I immediately called for my night gown  it was brought me  but of a considerable sum of money that was in the pocket of it  I could get no account  I complained to the captain of the violence that had been   15 done me  and of the robbery his men had committed  but he
