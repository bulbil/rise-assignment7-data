 has let the cat out of the bag  Signor de Moyadas  This unlucky accident has prevented me from paying my respects sooner  True love is diffident  nor could I venture in this garb into the presence of a mistress who was unacquainted with my person  I was therefore waiting the return of a servant whom I have sent to Calatrava  Such a trifle  rejoined the old man  must not deprive us of your company  and I insist upon it  that you make my house your home from this very moment   With such sort of importunity  he forced me into his family  but as we were on our way  the pretended robbery was a natural topic of conversation  and I should have made light of my baggage  though the loss was very considerable  had not Florence s picture unluckily formed a part of the booty  The old codger chuckled at that  and observed  that such a loss was easily repaired  the original was worth five hundred per cent  more than the copy  To make me amends  as soon as we got home  he called his daughter  a girl of not more than sixteen  with a person to have reclaimed a libertine  if beauty ever possessed that power except in romance  You behold  said he  the bale of goods my late brother has consigned to you  Oh  my good sir  exclaimed I in an impassioned tone  words are not wanting to assure me that this must be the lovely Florence  those bewitching features are engraven on my memory  their impression is indelible on my heart  If the portrait I have lost  the mere outline of these embodied charms  could kindle passion by its cold and lifeless likeness  judge what must be my agitation  my transport at this moment  Such language is too flattering to be sincere  said Florence  nor am I so weak and vain as to be persuaded that my merits warrant it  That is right  interchange your fine speeches  my children  This was a good natured encouragement from the father  who at once left me alone with his daughter  and taking Moralez aside  said to him  My friend  those who made so free with your baggage  doubtless did not stand upon any ceremony with your money  Very true  sir  answered my colleague  an overpowering band of robbers poured down upon us near Castil Blazo  and left us not a rag but what we carry on our backs  but we are in momentary expectation of receiving bills of exchange  and then we shall appear once more like ourselves   While you are waiting for your bills of exchange  replied the old man  taking a purse out of his pocket  here are a hundred pistoles with which you may do as you please  Oh  sir  rejoined Moralez  as if he were shocked  my master will never take them  You do not know him  Heaven and earth  he is a man of the nicest scruples in money matters  Not one of your shabby fellows  always spunging upon his friends  and ready to take up money wherever he can get it  Running in debt is ratsbane to him  If he is to beg his bread or go into an hospital  why there is an end of it  but as for borrowing  he will never be reduced to that  So much the better  said the good burgess  I value him the more for his independence  Running in debt is a mean thing  it ought to be ratsbane to him and everybody else  Your people of quality  to be sure  may plead prescription in their favour  there is a sort of privileged swindling  not incompatible with high honour  in high life  If tradesmen were to be paid  they would be too nearly on a level with their employers  But as your master has such upright principles  heaven forbid they should be violated in this house  Since any offer of pecuniary assistance would hurt his feelings  we must say no more about it  As the point seemed to be settled  the purse was for steering its course back again into the pocket  but my provident partner laid hold of Signor de Moyadas by the arm  and delayed the convoy  Stay  sir  said he  whatever aversion my master may have to borrowing on a general principle  and considered as borrowing  yet there is a light in which  with good management  he may be brought to look kindly on your hundred pistoles  In fact  it is only in a mercantile point of view  as an affair of debtor and creditor between strangers  that he holds this formal doctrine  but he is free and easy enough where he is on a family footing  Why  there is his own father  It is only ask and have  and he does ask and have accordingly  Now you are going to be a second father to him  and are fairly entitled to be put on the same confidential footing  He is a young man of nice discrimination  and will doubtless think you entitled to the compliment   By thus shifting his ground  Moralez got possession of the old gentleman s purse  As for the girl and myself  we were engaged in a little agreeable
