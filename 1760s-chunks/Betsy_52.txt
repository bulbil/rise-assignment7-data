 As to   that   replied she   I will undertake to inform myself of every thing   necessary for you to know  and  if you resolve to go  I will set about   it directly   I then told her  I would do any thing rather than be   exposed  on which she bid me assume as chearful a countenance as I   could  and depend on her bringing me some intelligence of Wildly before   I slept        The method she took to make good her promise was  it seems  to send a   person whom she could confide in to the seat of Lord       to enquire   among the servants  where Mr  Wildly  who had lately been a guest there    might be found  She told me that the answer they gave the man was  that   they knew not where he lodged  but that he might be heard of at any of   the coffee houses about St  James s  As I was altogether a stranger in   London  this information gave me but little satisfaction  but   Mademoiselle Grenouille  whose interest it was to hurry me away  assured   me that she knew that part of the town perfectly well  having lived   there several months on her first arrival in England  that there were   several great coffee houses there  frequented by all the gentlemen of   fashion  and that nothing would be more easy than to find Mr  Wildly at   one or other of them  My heart  however  shuddered at the thoughts of   this enterprize  yet her persuasions  joined to the terrors I was in of   being exposed  and the certainty that a discovery of my condition was   inevitable  made me resolve to undertake it        Nothing now remained but the means how I should get away  so as to   avoid the pursuit which might  doubtless  be made after me  which  after   some consultation  was thus contrived and executed        A flying coach set out from H     every Monday at two o clock in the   morning  Mademoiselle Grenouille engaged the same man who had enquired   at Lord      s for Mr  Wildly  to secure a place for me in it  The   Sunday before I was to go  I pretended indisposition to avoid going to   church  I passed that time in packing up the best of my things in a   large bundle  for I had no opportunity of taking a box or trunk with me    My greatest difficulty was how to get out of bed from Miss Bab  who   still lay with me  I thought  however  that if she happened to awake   while I was rising  I would tell her I was not very well  and was only   going into the next room  to open the window for a little air  but I   stood in no need of this precaution  she was in a sound sleep  and I   left my bed  put on the cloaths I was to travel in  and stole out of the   room  without her perceiving any thing of the matter  I went out by the   same way by which I had fulfilled my first fatal appointment with Mr    Wildly  At a little distance from the garden door  I found the friend of   Mademoiselle Grenouille  who waited for me with a horse and pillion  he   took my bundle before  and me behind him  and then we made the best of   our way towards H      where we arrived time enough for the coach  I   alighted at the door of the inn  and he rode off directly to avoid being   seen by any body  who might describe him  in case an enquiry should be   made        I will not trouble you with the particulars of my journey  nor how I   was amazed on entering this great metropolis  I shall only tell you    that it being dark when we came in  I lay that night at the inn  and the   next morning  following the directions Mademoiselle Grenouille had given   me  took a hackney coach  and ordered the man to drive into any of the   streets about St  James s  and stop at the first house where he should   see a bill upon the door for ready furnished lodgings  It happened to be   in Rider Street  the woman at first seemed a little scrupulous of taking   me  as I was a stranger  and had no recommendation  but on my telling   her I would pay her a fortnight beforehand  we agreed on the rate of   twelve shillings a week        The first thing I did was to send a porter to the coffee houses  where
