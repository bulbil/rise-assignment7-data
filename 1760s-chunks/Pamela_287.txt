  opinion  slight  or contempt  she expresses of her husband       I should expect  therefore  that she should draw a kind veil over my   faults  that such as she could not hide  she would extenuate  that she   would place my better actions in an advantageous light  and shew that I   had her good opinion  at least  whatever liberties the world took with   my character       She must have valued my friends for my sake  been cheerful and easy    whomsoever I had brought home with me  and  whatever faults she had   observed in me  have never blamed me before company  at least  with such   an air of superiority  as should have shewn she had a better opinion of   her own judgment  than of mine       Now  my Pamela  this is but a faint sketch of the conduct I must have   expected from my wife  let her quality have been what it would  or have   lived with her on bad terms  Judge then  if to me a lady of the modish   taste could have been tolerable       The perverseness and contradiction I have too often seen  in some of my   visits  even among people of sense  as well as condition  had prejudiced   me to the married state  and  as I knew I could not bear it  surely I   was in the right to decline it  And you see  my dear  that I have not   gone among this class of people for a wife  nor know I  indeed  where    in any class  I could have sought one  or had one suitable to my mind    if not you  For here is my misfortune  I could not have been contented   to have been but moderately happy in a wife       Judge you  from all this  if I could very well bear that you should   think yourself so well secured of my affection  that you could take the   faults of others upon yourself  and  by a supposed supererogatory merit    think your interposition sufficient to atone for the faults of others       Yet am I not perfect myself  No  I am greatly imperfect  Yet will I not   allow  that my imperfections shall excuse those of my wife  or make her   think I ought to bear faults in her  that she can rectify  because she   bears greater from me       Upon the whole  I may expect  that you will bear with me  and study my   temper  till  and only till  you see I am capable of returning insult   for obligation  and till you think  that I shall be of a gentler   deportment  if I am roughly used  than otherwise  One thing more I will   add  That I should scorn myself  if there was one privilege of your   sex  that a princess might expect  as my wife  to be indulged in  that   I would not allow to my Pamela  for you are the wife of my affections  I   never wished for one before you  nor ever do I hope to have another       I hope  sir  said I  my future conduct  Pardon me  said he  my dear  for   interrupting you  but it is to assure you  that I am so well convinced   of your affectionate regard for me  that I know I might have spared the   greatest part of what I have said  And  indeed  it must be very bad   for both of us  if I should have reason to think it necessary to say   so much  But one thing has brought on another  and I have rather spoken   what my niceness has made me observe in other families  than what I fear   in my own  And  therefore  let me assure you  I am thoroughly satisfied   with your conduct hitherto  You shall have no occasion to repent it  And   you shall find  though greatly imperfect  and passionate  on particular   provocations   which yet I will try to overcome   that you have not   a brutal or ungenerous husband  who is capable of offering insult for   condescension  or returning evil for good       I thanked him for these kind rules  and generous assurances  and assured   him  that they had made so much impression on my mind  that these  and   his most agreeable injunctions before given me  and such as he should   hereafter be pleased to give me  should be so many rules for my future   behaviour       And I am glad of the method I have taken of making a Journal of all that   passes in these first
