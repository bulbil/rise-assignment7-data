clapped to the door   and taking out the pistol Gentle    men  I cried   I starve  I die for want   resolve instantly to relieve    or to perish along with me      They all fixed their eyes upon me   but the meagre frenzy  as I   suppose  which they saw in my countenance  held them silent  The   person who was nearest  directly took out his purse and presented   it to me  I again returned it to him  and putting up my pistol   No  no  sir  I cried  I will not take your gold  I am no robber    But give me some silver among ye  to keep a while from the grave   three creatures who famish amidst a plentiful world      They all  as by one consent  put their hands to their pockets    and instantly made a heap of upwards of three pounds  I de          TEE FOOL OF QUALITY  95     voured it with my eyes   I beheld it as a mint of money   and   panting  and grappling at it like a vulture  I stuffed it into a side    pocket   and  being too full of acknowledgments to thank my   benefactors by word or token  I burst forth into tears  and  turn    ing from them  I got once more into the street without any   interruption      I made directly home  and  stepping softly up stairs  I first re    stored the pistol to its old station  I then went to the closet    where my wife lay still asleep  I gently waked her by the fond    ness of my caresses  My Arabella  I cried  I have ventured out for   the first time  and heaven has sent us some small relief by a friend   that I happened to meet  Here  my love  I said  putting a crown   into her hand   call the maid  and send out for some comfortable   sustenance   our fast has been long indeed      Within a few days our strength and our spirits began to recruit    though we still continued to live much within the bounds of tem    perance  My soul again settled into a kind of sullen calm  and   looked forth  though at a distance  to some future dawning      One day  as my landlady s Bible lay shut before me  a sudden   thought occurred  I breathed up to God a short and silent ejacula    tion  beseeching him to instruct me in what I ought to do  by the   passage upon which my thumb should happen to rest on opening   the book  I instantly made the venture  and found the following   words     I will arise and go to my father  and will say unto him    Father  I have sinned against thee  and before heaven  and am no   more worthy to be called thy son       Alas   I was far from imagining at that time that it was no other   than my Father in heaven who called me  and who would thereby   have directed and conducted me to himself      I puzzled and racked my memory to discover in what I had   given just offence to my earthly progenitor  but resolved  at all   events  to observe the admonition      In the dusk of the evening  I tied my handkerchief sailor like   about my neck  I pulled my wig forward  and slouching my hat  I   slid out of doors   and  stooping half double  I limped with a coun    terfeited gait toward my father s  I was duly apprised that  if I   knocked at the door  or directly inquired for him  I should not   be admitted  I therefore walked to and again  now near  now aloof    for near an hour  before his door  in patient expectation of his   appearance      I had repeated this exercise for five successive evenings  when   the door at length opened  and a servant in livery came up and   accosted me  Is your name Clement  sir  Suppose it were  says   I  Supposing so  replied he  I am ordered to tell you that my   master is well informed of all your wicked designs   and that  if   ever you appear again in sight of his windows  he will send you to   Newgate without bail or mainprize  and prosecute you to the last   of the laws of the land      We parted without another word  and I crossed over the way to   a chandler s shop  The good woman of the house
