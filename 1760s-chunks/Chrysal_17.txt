doctor  Whitefield     I am come  my friend and brother in the Lord      said he    to inquire into thy spiritual state  to give thee ghostly   advice  and commune with thee  for a short space  for our mutual   edification        The surprise and manner of this address had such an efiect upon   my master that he could not refrain bursting into laughter   and   immediately recovered from the confusion into which the ridicule   of himself had thrown him          A good deal is said in Ghrysal about Foote s cruel attack   upon Whitefield in The Minor  and some of the references   need a little elucidation  The most uproarious comedy in   this scurrilous piece is concentrated on the stage version of   Mother Douglas  a notorious character who lived magnificently   in Covent Garden  and was reputed to be one of Whitefield s   proselytes  Foote himself took the part  and made it a   popular success in London  though a Dublin audience had   proved too squeamish  and voted Woodward s rendering   ofiensive to decency and also to their own opinion of the   Revivalists  The horribly droll manner in which this cari    cature of a woman mixes up spiritual and carnal things  is   comedy of a broad but very entertaining kind  and the satire   must l ave been overwhelming with an aiidience bitterly   prejudiced against the Methodists  Foote as Momus  and Mrs   Cole  alias Mother Douglas  as Mrs Brimstone  act a grotesque   scene in Ghrysal  along with their supposed friend and accom    plice Squintum  or Whitefield  who is represented in the most   odious manner as a sanctimonious rascal  who has taken up   preaching as a money making speculation  and employs   people of the stamp of Mrs Brimstone to bring grist to the   mill by corrupting those who are afterwards to be led into   the true fold  Cowper speaks out nobly upon the unjust   â€¢1 etraction of Whitefield s good name  general at this time       Leuconomus  beneath well sounding Greek     I slur a name a poet must not speak       Stood pilloried on infamy s high stage      And bore the pelting storm of half an age       The very butt of Slander and the blot     For every dart that Malice ever shot      The man that mentioned him  at once dismissed     AH mercy from his lips  and sneered  and hissed      His crimes were such as Sodom never knew      And Perjury stood up to swear it true           X3tx â€¢ INTBODUCTION     His aim was mischief  and his zeal pTetenoe      His speech rebellion against common sense       A knave when tried on honesty s plain rule      And when by that of reason a plain fool       The world s best comfort was  his doom was paased      Die when he might he must be damned at last      Now  Truth  perform thine office   waft aside   The curtain drawn by Prejudice and Pride    Reveal  the man is dead  to wondering eyes   This more than monster in his proper guise    He loved the world that hated him   the tear   That dropped upon his Bible was sincere     Assailed by scandal and the tongue of strife    His only answer was a blameless life    And he that forged  and he that threw  the dart    Had each a brother s interest in his heart    Paul s love of Christ  and steadiness unbribed    Were copied close in him  and well transcribed     He followed Paul  his zeal a kindled flame    His apostolic charity the same     Like him  crossed cheerfully tempestuous seas    Forsaking country  kindred  friends  and ease     Like him he laboured  and like him content   To bear it  suffered shame where er he went      Blush  Calumny   and write upon his tomb    If honest eulogy can spare thee room    Thy deep repentance of thy thousand lies    Which  aimed at him  have pierced the offended skies     And say    Blot out my sin  confessed  deplored    Against thine image  in thy saint  O Lord         Johnstone  it must be confessed  is not a humourist  His   satire is principally of the brutal order   yet he has many   attractions for the intellectual reader  He abounds in
