the Genius against them  but he set them entirely aside when he came to examine their little feet   The beauties of Circassia next made their appearance  They advanced hand in hand  singing the most immodest airs  and leading up a dance in the most luxurious attitudes  Their dress was but half a covering  the neck  the left breast  and all the limbs  were exposed to view  which after some time seemed rather to satiate than inflame desire  The lily and the rose contended in forming their complexions  and a soft sleepiness of eye added irresistible poignance to their charms  but their beauties were obtruded  not offered to their admirers  they seemed to give rather than receive courtship  and the genius of Love dismissed them as unworthy his regard  since they exchanged the duties of love  and made themselves not the pursued  but the pursuing sex     199The kingdom of Kashmire next produced its charming deputies  This happy region seemed peculiarly sequestered by nature for his abode  Shady mountains fenced it on one side from the scorching sun  and seaborn breezes  on the other  gave peculiar luxuriance to the air  Their complexions were of a bright yellow  that appeared almost transparent  while the crimson tulip seemed to blossom on their cheeks  Their features and limbs were delicate beyond the statuary s power to express  and their teeth whiter than their own ivory  He was almost persuaded to reside among them  when unfortunately one of the ladies talked of appointing his seraglio   In this procession the naked inhabitants of Southern America would not be left behind  their charms were found to surpass whatever the warmest imagination could conceive  and served to shew  that beauty could be perfect  even with the seeming disadvantage of a brown complexion But their savage education rendered them utterly unqualified to make the proper use of their power  and they were rejected as being incapable of uniting mental with sensual satisfaction  In this manner the deputies of other kingdoms had their suits rejected  the black beauties of Benin  and the tawny daughters of Borneo  the women of Wida with well scarred faces  and the hideous virgins of Cafraria  the squab ladies of Lapland  three feet high  and the giant fair ones of Patagonia   The beauties of Europe at last appeared  grace was in their steps  and sensibility sate smiling in every eye  It was the universal opinion  while they were approaching  that they would prevail    200 and the Genius seemed to lend them his most favourable attention  They opened their pretensions with the utmost modesty  but unfortunately as their orator proceeded she happened to let fall the words house in town  settlement and pin money  These seemingly harmless terms had instantly a surprising effect  the Genius with ungovernable rage burst from amidst the circle  and waving his youthful pinions  left this earth  and flew back to those etherial mansions from whence he descended   The whole assembly was struck with amazement  they now justly apprehended  that female power would be no more  since love had forsaken them  They continued some time thus in a state of torpid despair  when it was proposed by one of the number▪ that  since the real Genius had left them  in order to continue their power  they should set up an idol in his stead  and that the ladies of every country should furnish him with what each liked best  This proposal was instantly relished and agreed to  An idol was formed by uniting the capricious gifts of all the assembly  tho  no way resembling the departed Genius  The ladies of China furnished the monster with wings  those of Kashmire supplied him with horns  the dames of Europe clapped a purse in his hand  and the virgins of Congo furnished him with a tail Since that time  all the vows addressed to love are in reality paid to the idol  but  as in other false religions  the adoration seems most fervent  where the heart is least sincere  Adieu     201  LETTER CXII  To the same   MANKIND have ever been prone to expatiate in the praise of human nature  The dignity of man is a subject that has always been the favourite theme of humanity  they have declaimed with that ostentation  which usually accompanies such as are sure of having a partial audience  they have obtained victories  because there were none to oppose  Yet from all I have ever read or seen  men appear more apt to err by having too high  than by having too despicable an opinion of their nature  and by attempting to exalt their original place in the creation  depress their real value in society   The most ignorant nations have always been found to think most highly of themselves  The Deity has ever been thought peculiarly concerned in their glory and preservation  to have fought their battles  and inspired their teachers  their wizzards are said to be familiar with heaven  and every hero has a guard of angels  as well as men to attend him  When the Portuguese first came among the wretched inhabitants of the coast of Africa  these savage nations readily allowed the strangers more skill in navigation and war  yet still considered them  at best  but as useful servants brought to their coasts  by their guardian
