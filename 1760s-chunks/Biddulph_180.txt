 vouchsafe me such a portion of thy grace  that I may become an humble instrument of thy mercy  to those whom the rod of adversity has laid in the dust  Teach me so to use this thy bounteous favour  that Thy honour  not my worldly desires may be promoted  that Thy praise  not my pride may be exalted  And if  O Lord  thou hast chosen me to be the dispenser of thy fatherly kindness to the afflicted that cry unto thee  quicken in my heart such diligence  humility  and integrity  as may render me not unworthy of the important trust  But if  O my God  thou has sent riches only to be a trial of my strength  unsupported by thee  be merciful  take them from me  and restore to me that poverty  which first taught me to know myself ’  Upon my knees I have poured out this prayer to the Almighty  and it is the fervent wish of my soul that he would grant it   February 26  You will smile  my dear  as I did  in pity of the meanness of poor Lady Sarah  but proud people are always mean  I have been here but four days  yet I find she has already heard of my metamorphosis  Indeed she could hardly do otherwise  so near her as I am  Mr Warner has been very urgent with me to drive out in my new chariot  this I readily complied with  as both the children and I wanted air and exercise  and yesterday we drove to Hyde Park  I did not however go at the hour when there is most company  but I conclude I was seen either by Lady Sarah herself  or by some one who told her  for this morning  prodigious  she sent her woman to me with a message  I had her called up stairs  and enquired very civilly after my brother and his lady     She told me that Lady Sarah sent her humble service to me  and was very much surprised that she had not heard from me in so long a time  that she supposed I was gone out of town  but as Sir George seemed uneasy that I never wrote to him  her ladyship had sent her to enquire for me at my old lodgings in the Hay Market  from whence she had been directed to me here  and that she was ordered to tell me that her lady had talked to my brother about the affair that I knew of  and that Sir George would act agreeably to her request  if I would call or write a line to him   I found the woman had been instructed to feign an entire ignorance on her lady’s part of the change in my circumstances  but I was resolved to let her see I had detected this paltry artifice  I could observe that the servant  though she endeavoured to avoid it  eyed every thing in my apartment with surprise and curiosity  and I concluded that Lady Sarah had sent her for no other purpose  but to satisfy herself from her maid’s account  whether the report she had heard concerning me was true  Tell your lady  said I  she needed not to have been at the pains of framing such a message to have gratified her curiosity  my house is open to any one who has a mind to look at it  even to Lady Sarah herself  You shall see it all over  and may report to her ladyship what my cousin Warner’s bounty has done for me  and she may then judge whether I stand in need of the assistance she now pretends to offer me  The woman looked abashed  and though she seemed inclined to ask questions  was ashamed to do so  This was that very servant who had so unceremoniously led me up the back stairs when I went to visit her lady  but I appeared in a quite different light to her now  I rang the bell  and ordered a footman to shew her the house  She curtsied in silence  and withdrew   What a poor creature is Lady Sarah  Mr Warner called upon me before her woman went away  I told him the whole passage  Oh  how he chuckled  and rejoiced  shrugging his shoulders  and rubbing his hands  He wanted to see the servant  but I was afraid he would be too strong in his insults  and turned him from the point   He told me  he invited himself to dine with me  and accordingly he favoured me with his company  and staid during the greatest part of the evening  He is a man of a strong natural sense  though he is careless of improving it  He has passed his life in business  and in acquiring riches  He does not let me into the particulars of these  though he is in other respects very communicative and entertaining     There is a whimsical vein runs through his conversation  He now  for the first time  desired me to give him the particulars of my life from my childhood  which he had but a partial account of  at different times  from myself  I took up the story at the earliest period of my life  wherein any thing interesting had occurred  and traced every circumstance minutely to the
