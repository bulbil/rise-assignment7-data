good sense and spirit  in determining to make life agreable as long as they can       A propos to age  I am resolved to go home  Lucy  I have found three grey hairs this morning  they tell me  tis common  this vile climate is at war with beauty  makes one s hair grey  and one s hands red  I won t stay  absolutely       Do you know there is a very pretty fellow here  Lucy  Captain Howard  who has taken a fancy to make people believe he and I are on good terms  He affects to sit by me  to dance with me  to whisper nothing to me  to bow with an air of mystery  and to shew me all the little attentions of a lover in public  though he never yet said a civil thing to me when we were alone       I was standing with him this morning near the brow of the hill  leaning against a tree in the sunshine  and looking down the precipice below  when I said something of the lover s leap  and in play  as you will suppose  made a step forwards  we had been talking of indifferent things  his air was till then indolence itself  but on this little motion of mine  though there was not the least danger  he with the utmost seeming eagerness catched hold of me as if alarmed at the very idea  and with the most passionate air protested his life depended on mine  and that he would not live an hour after me  I looked at him with astonishment  not being able to comprehend the meaning of this sudden flight  when turning my head  I saw a gentleman and lady close behind us  whom he had observed though I had not  They were retiring   Pray approach  my dear Madam   said I   we have no secrets  this declaration was intended for you to hear  we were talking of the weather before you came        He affected to smile  though I saw he was mortified  but as his smile shewed the finest teeth imaginable I forgave him  he is really very handsome  and  tis pity he has this foolish quality of preferring the shadow to the substance       I shall  however  desire him to flirt elsewhere  as this badinage  however innocent  may hurt my character  and give pain to my little Fitzgerald  I believe I begin to love this fellow  because I begin to be delicate on the subject of flirtations  and feel my spirit of coquetry decline every day   29th       Mrs  Clayton has wrote  my dear  and has at last condescended to allow Emily the honor of being her daughter in law  in consideration of her son s happiness  and of engagements entered into with her own consent  though she very prudently observes  that what was a proper match for Captain Clayton is by no means so for Sir George  and talks something of an offer of a citizen s daughter with fifty thousand pounds  and the promise of an Irish title  She has  however  observed that indiscreet engagements are better broke than kept       Sir George has shewn the letter  a very indelicate one in my opinion  to my father and me  and has talked a great deal of nonsense on the subject  He wants to shew it to Emily  and I advise him to it  because I know the effect it will have  I see plainly he wishes to make a great merit of keeping his engagement  if he does keep it  he hinted a little fear of breaking her heart  and I am convinced  if he thought she could survive his infidelity  all his tenderness and constancy would cede to filial duty and a coronet   Eleven o clock       After much deliberation  Sir George has determined to write to Emily  inclose his mother s letter  and call in the afternoon to enjoy the triumph of his generosity in keeping his engagement  when it is in his power to do so much better   tis a pretty plan  and I encourage him in it  my father  who wishes the match  shrugs his shoulders  and frowns at me  but the little man is fixed as fate in his resolve  and is writing at this moment in my father s apartment  I long to see his letter  I dare say it will be a curiosity   tis short  however  for he is coming out of the room already       Adieu  my father calls for this letter  it is to go in one of his to New York  and the person who takes it waits for it at the door   Ever yours   A  FERMOR     LETTER LIX   59   To Miss MONTAGUE  at Silleri       Dear Madam   I SEND you the inclosed from my mother  I thought it necessary you should see it  though not even a mother s wishes shall ever influence me to break those engagements which I have had the happiness of entering into with the most charming of women  and which a man of honor ought to hold sacred       I do not think
