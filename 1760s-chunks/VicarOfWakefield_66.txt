from my brother George   —   What of him  child    interrupted I    does he know of our misery  I hope my boy is exempt from any part of what his wretched family suffers    —   Yes  sir    returned he    he is perfectly gay  chearful  and happy  His letter brings nothing but good news  he is the favourite of his colonel  who promises to procure him the very next lieutenancy that becomes vacant     And are you sure of all this    cried my wife    are you sure that nothing ill has befallen my boy    —   Nothing indeed  madam    returned my son    you shall see the letter  which will give you the highest pleasure  and if any thing can procure you comfort  I am sure that will     But are you sure    still repeated she    that the letter is from himself  and that he is really so happy   —  Page  140  Yes  Madam    replied he    it is certainly his  and he will one day be the credit and the support of our family    —   Then I thank providence    cried she    that my last letter to him has miscarried     Yes  my dear    continued she   turning to me    I will now confess that though the hand of heaven is sore upon us in other instances  it has been favourable here  By the last letter I wrote my son  which was in the bitterness of anger  I desired him  upon his mother s blessing  and if he had the heart of a man  to see justice done his father and sister  and avenge our cause  But thanks be to him that directs all things  it has miscarried  and I am at rest     Woman    cried I   thou hast done very ill  and at another time my reproaches might have been more severe  Oh  what a tremendous gulph hast thou escaped  that would have buried both thee and him in endless ruin  Providence  indeed   Page  141  has here been kinder to us than we to ourselves  It has reserved that son to be the father and protector of my children when I shall be away  How unjustly did I complain of being stript of every comfort  when still I hear that he is happy and insensible of our afflictions  still kept in reserve to support his widowed mother  to protect his brothers and sisters  But what sisters has he left  he has no sisters now  they are all gone  robbed from me  and I am undone    —   Father    interupted my son    I beg you will give me leave to read his letter  I know it will please you    Upon which  with my permission  he read as follows   Page  142  Honoured Sir   I Have called off my imaginationa few moments from the pleasures that surround me  to fix it upon objects that are still more pleasing  the dear little fire side at home  My fancy draws that harmless groupe as listening to every line of this with great composure  I view those faces with delight which never felt the deforming hand of ambition or distress  But whatever your happiness may be at home  I am sure it will be some addition to it  to hear that I am perfectly pleased with my situation  and every way happy here     Our regiment is countermanded and is not to leave the kingdom  the colonel  who professes himself my friend  takes me with him to all companies where he is acquainted  and after my first visit I generally find myself received with encreased respect upon repeating it  I danced last  Page  143  night with Lady G—  and could I forget you know whom  I might be perhaps successful  But it is my fate still to remember others  while I am myself forgotten by most of my absent friends  and in this number  I fear  Sir  that I must consider you  for I have long expected the pleasure of a letter from home to no purpose  Olivia and Sophia too  promised to write  but seem to have forgotten me  Tell them they are two arrant little baggages  and that I am this moment in a most violent passion with them  yet still  I know not how  tho  I want to bluster a little  my heart is respondent only to softer emotions  Then tell them  sir  that after all  I love them affectionately  and be assured of my ever remaining    Your dutiful son   Page  144     In all our miseries    cried I    what thanks have we not to return  that one at least of our family is exempted from what we suffer  Heaven be his guard  and keep my boy thus happy to be the supporter of his widowed mother
