  Hold  my friend  replied my companion  were your reformation to take place  as dancing masters and fiddlers now mimic gentlemen in appearance  we should then find our fine gentlemen conforming to theirs  A beau might be introduced to a lady of fashion with a   227 fiddle case hanging at his neck by a red ribbon  and  instead of a cane  might carry a fiddle stick  Tho  to be as dull as a first rate dancing master might be used with proverbial justice  yet  dull as he is  many a fine gentleman sets him up as the proper standard of politeness  copies not only the pert vivacity of his air  but the flat insipidity of his conversation  In short  if you make a law against dancing masters imitating the fine gentleman  you should with as much reason enact  That no fine gentleman shall imitate the dancing master   After I had left my friend  I made towards home  reflecting as I went upon the difficulty of distinguishing men by their appearance  Invited  however  by the freshness of the evening  I did not return directly  but went to ruminate on what had passed in a public garden belonging to the city  Here  as I sate upon one of the benches  and felt the pleasing sympathy which nature in bloom inspires  a disconsolate figure  who sate on the other end of the seat  seemed no way to enjoy the serenity of the season   His dress was miserable beyond description  a thread bare coat of the rudest materials  a shirt  though clean  yet extremely coarse  hair that seemed to have been long unconscious of the comb  and all the rest of his equi impressed with the marks of genuine poverty   As he continued to sigh  and testify every symptom of despair  I was naturally led  from a motive of humanity  to offer comfort and assistance  You know my heart  and that all who are miserable may claim a place there  The pensive stranger at   228 first declined any conversation  but at last perceiving a peculiarity in my accent and manner of thinking  he began to unfold himself by degrees   I now found that he was not so very miserable as he at first appeared  upon my offering him a small piece of money  he refused my favour  yet without appearing displeased at my intended generosity  It is true he sometimes interrupted the conversation with a sigh  and talked pathetically of neglected merit  yet still I could perceive a serenity in his countenance  that  upon a closer inspection  bespoke inward content   Upon a pause in the conversation I was going to take my leave  when he begged I would favour him with my company home to supper  I was surprized at such a demand from a person of his appearance  but willing to indulge curiosity  I accepted his invitation  and though I felt some repugnance at being seen with one who appeared so very wretched  went along with seeming alacrity   Still as he approached nearer home  his good humour proportionably seemed to encrease  At last he stopped  not at the gate of an hovel  but of a magnificent palace  When I call my eyes upon all the sumptuous elegance which every where presented upon entering  and then when I looked at my seeming miserable conductor  I could scarce think that all this finery belonged to him  yet in fact it did  Numerous servants ran through the apartments with silent assiduity  several ladies of beauty and magnificently dressed came to welcome his return  a most elegant supper was provided  in short  I found the person  whom a little before I   229 had sincerely pitied  to be in reality a most refined epicure  One who courted contempt abroad  in order to feel with keener gust the pleasure of preeminence at home  Adieu   LETTER LI  From the same   HOW often  have we admired the eloquence of Europe  That strength of thinking  that delicacy of imagination  even beyond the efforts of the Chinese themselves  How were we enraptured with those bold figures which sent every sentiment with force to the heart  How have we spent whole days together in learning those arts by which European writers got within the passions and led the reader as if by enchantment   But though we have learned most of the rhetorical figures of the last age  yet there seems to be one or two of great use here  which have not yet travelled to China  The figures I mean are called Bawdy and Pertness  none are more fashionable  none so sure of admirers  they are of such a nature  that the merest blockhead  by a proper use of them  shall have the reputation of a wit  they lye level to the meanest capacities  and address those passions which all have  or would be ashamed to disown   It has been observed  and I believe with some truth  that it is very difficult for a dunce to obtain the reputation of a wit  yet by the assistance   230 of the figure Bawdy  this may be easily effected  and a bawdy blockhead often passes for a fellow of smart parts and pretensions  Every object in nature helps the jokes forward  without scarce any effort
