I  in unreserved freedom  wrote to him on the subject of my acquaintance with Miss B   I have but one resource left  perhaps  madam  you will think it a strange one  To the lady herself I must appeal  She will do me justice  and I am sure will be ready to acknowlege that I am no betrayer of innocence  no breaker of promises  that I was surprized into the commission of a fault  for which I have paid so dear a price   Her testimony  madam  may perhaps have some weight with you  though I propose nothing more by it  than that you may think of me with less detestation  You have banished me from your presence  I am a voluntary exile from my country  and from my friends  submit to the chastisement  and would do anything to expiate my offence against you and Miss Bidulph  There is but one command which you can possibly lay on me  to which I would not pay a perfect and ready obedience  but that act  perhaps  is the only one which would make me appear worthy of your esteem   The lady whom it has been my ill fate to render unhappy  and by whom I am made unutterably so  will  ere long  come to a house at Putney  which I have taken on purpose for her  I have placed in it my housekeeper  a grave worthy woman  under whose care she will be safe  and attended with that secresy and tenderness which her condition requires   I have written to her a faithful account of every thing relative to my hoped for alliance with your family  and the occasion of the treaty’s being broken off  As she must  by this means  know that your ladyship is acquainted with her story  I have told her  that  perhaps you might  from the interest you took in her misfortune  be induced to see her in her retirement  Let me  therefore  conjure you  madam  by that pious zeal which governs all your actions  and by the love you bear that daughter so deservedly dear to you  to take compassion on this young lady  She has no friends  nor any acquaintance in this part of the kingdom  her situation will require the comfort of society  and    perhaps  the advice of wisdom  It will be an act worthy of your humanity to shew some countenance to her   I think she will be in very good hands with the honest woman who waits her coming  but if any thing should happen otherwise than well  it would make me doubly wretched   To one who has no resources of contentment in her own bosom  solitude cannot be a friend  this I fear may be the lady’s case  and this makes me with the more earnestness urge my request to you  Forgive me  madam  for the liberty I take with you  a liberty  which  though I confess it needs an apology  yet is it at the same time a proof of the confidence I have in you  which I hope will not affront either your candour or your virtue   If you will condescend to grant this request  I shall obtain the two wishes at present most material to my peace  the one to secure to the lady a compassionate friend  already inclined to espouse her cause  the other  to put it in your power to be satisfied from the lady’s own mouth  of the truth of what I have asserted  I trust to her generosity to deal openly on this occasion   I wish you and Miss Bidulph every blessing that Heaven can bestow  and am  with great respect   Madam  Your ladyship’s Most obedient humble Servant  Orlando Faulkland   P S  The lady will go by the name of Mrs Jefferis  you will pardon me for not having mentioned her real name  I never yet told it even to Sir George  but I presume she will make no secret of it to you  if you honour her with a visit   Poor Orlando  unhappy Miss B  I could name a third person  that is not happy neither  What a pity it is  that so many good qualities  should be blotted by imperfections  how tender is his compassion for this poor girl  how ingenuous his conduct  but still he flies from her  I fear she can never hope to recover him  There is but one thing  he says  which he would not do  the only act  perhaps  by which he could make himself appear worthy of my mother’s esteem  The meaning of this but too plainly shews him determined against marrying Miss B  I don’t know any thing else which would reconcile my mother to him   I make no doubt of her complying with Mr Faulkland’s request    in seeing the lady  she is very compassionate  particularly to her own sex   What a strange resource indeed is this of Mr Faulkland’s  to appeal to the lady herself  What am I to judge from it  but that the unfortunate victim  ignorant of the treachery that was practised against her by her wicked aunt  and that her destroyer paid a price for her dishonour  exculpates him from the worst part of the
