to his ends  than an open declaration  Had he not  he asked  found means to fascinate Olivia and as many women as he came into company with —For his part  he loved not the Chevalier  He had forced him by his intrepidity to be civil to him  But forced civility was but a temporary one  It was his way to judge of causes by the effects  And this he knew  that he had lost a sister who would have been a jewel in the Crown of a prince  And would not be answerable for consequences  if he and Sir Charles Grandison were once more to meet  be it where it would        Father Marescotti  however  joining  as the Bishop writes  with him  and the Marchioness  in a desire to try this expedient  and being sure that the Marquis   60 quis and Signor Jeronymo would not be averse to it  he took a resolution to write over to him  as has been related      This  Lucy  is the state of the unhappy case  as briefly and as clearly as my memory will serve to give it  And what a rememberer  if I may make a word  is the heart —Not a circumstance escapes it   And now it remained for me to know of Sir Charles what answer he had returned   Was not my situation critical  my dear  Had Sir Charles asked my opinion  before he had taken his resolutions  I should have given it with my whole heart  that he should fly to the comfort of the poor Lady  But then he would have shewn a suspense unworthy of Clementina  and a compliment to me  which a good man so circumstanced ought not to make   My regard for him  yet what a poor affected word is regard   was nevertheless as strong as ever  Generosity  or rather justice  to Clementina  and that so often avowed regard to him  pulled my heart two ways —I wanted to consider with myself for a few moments  I was desirous to clear the conduct that I was to shew on this trying occasion  as well of precipitance as of affectation  and my cousin Reeves just then coming in for something she wanted  I took the opportunity  while he made a compliment to her  to say  as to both  I will return immediately  And withdrew   I went up to my own apartment  I traversed my antechamber  three or four times  Harriet Byron  said I to myself  be not mean  Hast thou not the example of a Clementina before thee  Her religion and her love  combating together  have overturned the noble creature s reason  Thou canst not be called to such a tryal  But canst thou not shew  that if thou wert  thou couldst have acted greatly  if not so greatly —Sir Charles Grandison is just  He ought to prefer   61 to thee the excellent Clementina  Priority of claim  compassion for the noble sufferer  merits so superior —I love him for his merits  Shall I not love merits nearly as great in one of my own sex  The struggle will cost thee something  But go down  and try to be above thyself   Down I went  not displeased with myself for haveing been able to resolve upon such an effort  Banish d to thy retirement  to thy pillow  thought I  be all the girl  Often have I contended for the dignity of my sex  let me now be an example to myself  and not unworthy in my own eyes  when I come to reflect  of an union  could it have been effected  with a man whom a Clementina looked up to with hope   My cousin withdrew when I came in  Sir Charles met me at the door  I hope he saw dignity in my aspect  without pride   I spoke  while spirit was high in me  and to keep myself up to it —My heart bleeds  Sir  for the distresses of your Clementina  Yes  Lucy  I said your Clementina   I could not but withdraw for a few moments to contemplate her great behaviour  and I most sincerely lament her distresses  What  that is in the power of man  cannot Sir Charles Grandison do  You have honoured me  Sir  with the title of Sister  In the tenderness of that relation  permit me to say  that I dread the effects of the General s petulance  I feel next for you the pain that it must give to your humane heart to be once more personally present to the woes of the inimitable Clementina  But I am sure you did not hesitate a moment about leaving all your friends here in England  and resolving to hasten over to try  at least  what can be done for the noble sufferer   Had he praised me highly for this my address to him  it would have looked  such was the situation on both sides  as if he had thought this disinterested behaviour in me  an extraordinary piece of magnanimity  and   62 self denial  and  of consequence  as if he had supposed I had views upon him  which he wonder d I could give up
