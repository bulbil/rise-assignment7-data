and said  he hoped    6 22 15  3 45 PM   I would not take it amiss that he and I were to sup by ourselves  as he  had something to say  which could not be so properly communicated before  company or servants  I then  for the first time  perceived his drift   to my no small surprise and indignation  and  with evident marks of  displeasure  told him  I was sure he had nothing to propose that would  be agreeable to my inclination  and that I would immediately leave the  house  Upon which he gave me to understand  that I could not possibly  retire  because he had sent away my chair  and all his servants were  disposed to obey his orders    Incensed at this declaration  which I considered as an insult  I  answered  with an air of resolution  it was very well  I despised his  contrivance  and was afraid of nothing  Seeing me thus alarmed  he  assured me I had no reason to be afraid  that he had loved me long  and  could find no other opportunity of declaring his passion  He said the  Q   had told him that Lord    had renewed his addresses to me  and   as he understood from my own mouth  my correspondence with S   was  absolutely broke off  he thought himself as well entitled as another to  my regard  In conclusion  he told me that I might command his purse  and  that he had power enough to bring me into the world again with eclat  To  these advances I replied  that he was very much mistaken in his opinion  of my character  if he imagined I was to be won by any temptations of  fortune  and very frankly declared  that I would rather give myself to a  footman  than sell myself to a prince    Supper being served  we sat down together  but I would neither eat  nor drink anything  except a little bread and water  for I was an odd  whimsical girl  and it came into my head  that he might perhaps have  mixed something in the victuals or wine  which would alter my way of  thinking  In short  finding himself baffled in all his endeavours  he  permitted me about twelve o clock to depart in peace  and gave up his  suit as a desperate cause    This uncomfortable life did I lead for a whole twelvemonth  without  feeling the least abatement of my melancholy  Finding myself worn to a  skeleton  I resumed my former resolution of trying to profit by change  of place  and actually went abroad  with no other attendant than my  woman  and the utmost indifference for life  My intention was to have  gone to the south of France  where I thought I could have subsisted on  the little I had left  which amounted to five hundred pounds  until the  issue of my law suit  by which I hoped to obtain some provision from my  lord  and  without all doubt  my expectation would have been answered   had I put this my plan in execution  but  being at Paris  from whence  I proposed to set forward in a few days  I sent to M  K    who had been  formerly intimate with my father  and shown me many civilities during my  first residence in France    This gentleman favoured me with a visit  and  when I made him  acquainted with my scheme  dissuaded me from it  as an uncomfortable  determination  He advised me to stay at Paris  where  with good economy   I could live as cheap as in any other place  and enjoy the conversation  and countenance of my friends  among which number he declared himself  one of the most faithful  He assured me  that I should be always welcome  to his table  and want for nothing  He promised to recommend me as a  lodger to a friend of his  with whom I would live in a frugal and decent  manner  and observed  that  as the woman was well known and esteemed by  all the English company in Paris  it would be the most reputable step    6 22 15  3 45 PM   I could take  considering my youth and situation  to lodge with a  creditable person  who could answer for my conduct  Thus persuaded  I  very simply followed his advice  I say simply  because  notwithstanding  his representations  I soon found my money melt away  without any  prospect of a fresh supply  In lieu of this  however  I passed my time  very agreeably in several English and some French families  where  in a  little time  I became quite intimate  saw a great deal of company  and  was treated with the utmost politeness and regard  yet  in the midst of  these pleasures  many a melancholy sigh would rise at the remembrance of  my beloved S    whom  for several years  I could not recollect
