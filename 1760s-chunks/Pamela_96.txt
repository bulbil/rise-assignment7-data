have persuaded you to come with me  the man was out of his wits   with his gratitude to me  and so has laid open all his heart to me  and   told me all that has passed  and was contriving between you two  This   alarmed me prodigiously  and the rather  as I saw  by two or three   instances  that his honest heart could keep nothing  believing every one   as undesigning as himself  I said  but yet with a heavy heart  Ah  Mrs    Jewkes  Mrs  Jewkes  this might have done with me  had he had any thing   that he could have told you of  But you know well enough  that had we   been disposed  we had no opportunity for it  from your watchful care and   circumspection  No  said she  that s very true  Mrs  Pamela  not so   much as for that declaration that he owned before me  he had found   opportunity  for all my watchfulness  to make you  Come  come  said she    no more of these shams with me  You have an excellent head piece for   your years  but may be I am as cunning as you   However  said she    all is well now  because my watchments are now over  by my master s   direction  How have you employed yourself in my absence       I was so troubled at what might have passed between Mr  Williams and   her  that I could not hide it  and she said  Well  Mrs  Pamela  since   all matters are likely to be so soon and so happily ended  let me advise   you to be a little less concerned at his discoveries  and make me your   confidant  as he has done  and I shall think you have some favour for   me  and reliance upon me  and perhaps you might not repent it       She was so earnest  that I mistrusted she did this to pump me  and I   knew how  now  to account for her kindness to Mr  Williams in her visit   to him  which was only to get out of him what she could  Why  Mrs    Jewkes  said I  is all this fishing about for something  where there   is nothing  if there be an end of your watchments  as you call them    Nothing  said she  but womanish curiosity  I ll assure you  for one is   naturally led to find out matters  where there is such privacy intended    Well  said I  pray let me know what he has said  and then I ll give you   an answer to your curiosity  I don t care  said she  whether you do or   not for I have as much as I wanted from him  and I despair of getting   out of you any thing you ha n t a mind I should know  my little cunning   dear   Well  said I  let him have said what he would  I care not  for I   am sure he can say no harm of me  and so let us change the talk       I was the easier  indeed  because  for all her pumps  she gave no hints   of the key and the door  etc  which  had he communicated to her  she   would not have forborne giving me a touch of   And so we gave up one   another  as despairing to gain our ends of each other  But I am sure he   must have said more than he should   And I am the more apprehensive all   is not right  because she has now been actually  these two hours  shut   up a writing  though she pretended she had given me up all her stores   of papers  etc  and that I should write for her  I begin to wish I had   ventured every thing and gone off  when I might  O when will this state   of doubt and uneasiness end          She has just been with me  and says she shall send a messenger to   Bedfordshire  and he shall carry a letter of thanks for me  if I will   write it for my master s favour to me  Indeed  said I  I have no thanks   to give  till I am with my father and mother  and besides  I sent a   letter  as you know  but have had no answer to it  She said  she thought   that his letter to Mr  Williams was sufficient  and the least I could   do was to thank him  if but in two lines  No need of it  said I  for I   don t intend to have Mr  Williams  What then is that letter to me
