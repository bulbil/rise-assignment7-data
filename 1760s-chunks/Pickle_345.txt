 a eulogium upon his good friend Sir Steady  The nature of his work had  animated his countenance with an uncommon degree of vivacity  and being  dressed in a neat deshabille  his figure could not have appeared to more  advantage in the eye of a person who despised the tinsel of unnecessary  ornament  She was extremely well pleased to see her expectations so  agreeably disappointed  for  instead of the squalid circumstances and  wretched looks attending indigence and distraction  everything was  decent and genteel  and the patient s aspect such as betokened internal  satisfaction  Hearing the rustling of silk in his room  he lifted up  his eyes from the paper  and  seeing her ladyship  was struck  with astonishment and awe  as at the unexpected apparition of some  supernatural being   Before he could recollect himself from his confusion  which called  the blood into his cheeks  she told him that  on the strength of old  acquaintance  she was come to visit him  though it was a long time since  he had given her good reason to believe he had absolutely forgot that  there was such a person as she in being  After having made the most warm  acknowledgments for this unforeseen honour  he assured her ladyship that  the subject of her reproach was not his fault  but rather his very  great misfortune  and that  if it had been in his power to forget her so  easily as she seemed to imagine  he should never have given her cause to  tax him with want of duty and respect     6 22 15  3 45 PM   Still dubious of his situation  she began to converse with him  on different subjects  and he acquitted himself so well in every  particular  that she no longer doubted his having been misrepresented by  the malice of his enemies  and candidly told him the cause and intent  of her coming  He was not deficient in expressions of gratitude for this  instance of her generosity and friendship  which even drew tears from  his eyes  As to the imputation of madness  he explained it so much to  her ladyship s satisfaction  that she evidently perceived he had been  barbarously dealt with  and that the charge was no other than a most  villainous aspersion  Notwithstanding all his endeavours to conceal  the true state of his finances  it was impossible for him to give this  detail  without disclosing some of the difficulties under which he  laboured  and  her ladyship s sagacity divining the rest  she not only  made him a tender of assistance  but  presenting a bank note for a  considerable sum  insisted upon his acceptance of it as a trifling mark  of her esteem  and a specimen of what she was inclined to do in his  behalf  But this mark of her benevolence he would by no means receive   assuring her  that  though his affairs were at present a little  perplexed  he had never felt the least circumstance of distress   and begging that she would not subject him to the burden of such an  unnecessary obligation   Being obliged to put up with this refusal she protested she would never  forgive him should she ever hear that he rejected her offer when he  stood in need of her aid  or if  in any time to come  he should not  apply to her friendship  if ever he should find himself incommoded in  point of fortune   An overdelicacy in this respect   said she   I shall  look upon as a disapprobation of my own conduct  because I myself have  been obliged to have recourse to my friends in such emergencies   These  generous remonstrances and marks of particular friendship could not  fail to make a deep impression upon the heart of our hero  which still  smarted from the former impulse of her charms  he not only felt all  those transports which a man of honour and sensibility may be supposed  to feel upon such an occasion  but the sentiments of a more tender  passion awaking in his breast  he could not help expressing himself in  terms adapted to the emotion of his soul  and  at length  plainly told  her  that  were he disposed to be a beggar  he would ask something of  infinitely more importance to his peace than the charitable assistance  she had proffered  Her ladyship had too much penetration to mistake his  meaning  but  as she did not choose to encourage his advances  pretended  to interpret his intimation into a general compliment of gallantry  and   in a jocose manner  desired he would not give her any reason to believe  his lucid interval was past   In faith  my lady   said he   I perceive  the fit coming on  and I don t see why I may not use the privilege of  my distemper  so far as to declare myself one of your most passionate  admirers     If you do   replied her ladyship   I shall not be fool  enough to believe a madman  unless I were assured that your disorder  proceeded from your love  and
