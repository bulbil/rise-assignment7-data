the argument Ad Crumenam —I will lay twenty guineas to a single crown piece   which will serve to give away to Obadiah when he gets back  that this same Stevinus was some engineer or other —or has wrote something or other  either directly or indirectly  upon the science of fortification   He has so —replied my uncle Toby —I knew it  said my father —tho   for the soul of me  I cannot see what kind of connection there can be betwixt Dr  Slop s sudden coming  and a discourse upon fortification —yet I fear d it —Talk of what we will  brother —or let the occasion be never so foreign or unfit for the subject —you are sure to bring it in  I would not  brother Toby  continued    my father —I declare I would not have my head so full of curtins and horn works —That  I dare say  you would not  quoth Dr  Slop  interrupting him  and laughing most immoderately at his pun   Dennis the critic could not detest and abhor a pun  or the insinuation of a pun  more cordially than my father —he would grow testy upon it at any time —but to be broke in upon by one  in a serious discourse  was as bad  he would say  as a fillip upon the nose —he saw no difference   Sir  quoth my uncle Toby  addressing himself to Dr  Slop —the curtins my brother Shandy mentions here  have nothing to do with bed steads —tho   I know  Du Cange says   That bed curtains     in all probability  have taken their name from them  —nor have the horn works  he speaks of  any thing in the world to do with the horn works of cuckoldom —But the curtin  Sir  is the word we use in fortification  for that part of the wall or rampart which lies between the two bastions and joins them —Besiegers seldom offer to carry on their attacks directly against the curtin  for this reason  because they are so well flanked    Tis the case of other curtins  quoth Dr  Slop  laughing   However  continued my uncle Toby  to make them sure  we generally choose to place ravelins before them  taking care only to extend them beyond the fossé or ditch —The common men  who know very little of fortification  confound the ravelin and the half moon together —tho  they are very different things —not in their figure or    construction  for we make them exactly aliks in all points —for they always consist of two faces  making a salient angle  with the gorges  not straight  but in form of a crescent —Where then lies the difference   quoth my father  a little testily  —In their situations  answered my uncle Toby —For when a ravelin  brother  stands before the curtin  it is a ravelin  and when a ravelin stands before a bastion  then the ravelin is not a ravelin —it is a half moon —a half moon likewise is a half moon  and no more  so long as it stands before its bastion —but was it to change place  and get before the curtin — twould be no longer a half moon  a half moon  in that case  is not a half moon — tis no more than a ravelin —I think  quoth my father  that the noble science of defence has its weak sides —as well as others     —As for the horn works  high  ho  sigh d my father  which  continued my uncle Toby  my brother was speaking of  they are a very considerable part of an outwork —they are called by the French engineers  Ouvrage à corne  and we generally make them to cover such places as we suspect to be weaker than the rest — tis form d by two epaulments or demibastions —they are very pretty  and if you will take a walk  I ll engage to shew you one well worth your trouble —I own  continued my uncle Toby  when we crown them —they are much stronger  but then they are very expensive  and take up a great deal of ground  so that  in my opinion  they are most of use to cover or defend the head of a camp  otherwise the double tenaille—By the mother who bore us —brother    Toby  quoth my father  not able to hold out any longer —you would provoke a saint —here have you got us  I know not how  not only souse into the middle of the old subject again —But so full is your head of these confounded works  that tho  my wife is this moment in the pains of labour —and you hear her cry out —yet nothing will serve you but to carry off the man midwife —Accoucheur —if you please  quoth Dr  Slop —With all my heart  replied my father  I don t care what they call you —but I wish the whole science of fortification  with all its inventors  at the devil —it has been the death of thousands —and it will be mine  in the end —I would not  I would not  brother Toby  have my brains so full of saps  mines  blinds  gabions  palisadoes  ravelins  half moons
