not from   234 the justice of the King s administration  nor from the love the people had to their Sovereign  but  happily for the reigning tyrant  he enjoyed the effects of his predecessor s prudence  not his own   LETTER XXX   AS  in a family  the faults and the impertinence of servants are often to be ascribed to their masters  so  in a state  the vices and the in…ence of favourites should justly be attributed to the King who employs them  The pride of Wolsey was gret  but his riches were still greater  a… in ordr to have a pretext for amassing such sums  he undertook to found two new colleges at Oxford  for which he received every day fresh grants from the Pope and the King  To execute his scheme he obtained a liberty of suppressing several monasteries  and converting their funds to the benefit of his intended scheme  Whatever might have been the Pope s inducement to grant him these privileges  nothing could be more fatal to the Pontiff s interests  for Henry was thus himself taught to imitate afterwards what he had seen a subject perform without crime or danger   Hitherto the administration of affairs was carried on by Wolsey alone  as for the King  he lost in the embraces of his mistresses all the complaints of the nation  and the Cardinal undertook to keep him ignorant  in rder to maintain his own authority  But now a period approached that was to put an end to this minister s exorbitant power  one of the most extraordinary and important revolutions that ever employed the attention of man  was now ripe for execution  But  to have a clear idea of this   235 grand reformation  it will be proper to take a cursory view of the state of the church at that time  and observe by what seemingly contradictory means Providence produces the happiest events   The church of Rome had now  for more than a thousand years  been corrupting the sacred doctrines of Christianity  and converting into a temporality the kingdom of another world  The Popes were frequently found at the head of their own armies  fighting for their dominions with the arm of flesh  and forgetting  in cruelty and immoral politics  all the pretended sanctity of their character  They drained other kingdoms of their treasures upon the most infamous pretexts  and were proud of setting at Rome  in their own conduct  an example of refined pleasure and studied luxury  The cardinals  prelates  and dignitaries of the church lived and were served like voluptuous Princes  and some of them were found to possess eight or nine bishoprics at a time  Wherever the church governs  it exerts its power with cruelty  and to their luxury these great ones added the crime of being tyrants too   As for the inferior clergy  both Popish and Protestant writers exclaim against their dissolute and abandoned morals  They publicly kept mistresses  and bequeathed to their bastards whatever they were able to save from their pleasures  or extort from the poor  There is still to be seen  says a fine writer  a will made by a Bishop of Cambray  in which he sets aside a certain sum   for the bastards he has had already  and those which  by the blessing of God  be may yet happen to have   In many parts of England and Germany the people obliged the priests to have concubines  so that the laity might keep their wives in greater security  while the   236 poor laborious peasant and artizan saw all the fruits of their toil go  not to clothe and maintain their own little families  but to pamper men who insulted and despised them     But the vices of the clergy were not greater than their ignorance  few of them knew the meaning of their own Latin mass  they were chiefly employed in finding out witches  and exorcising the possessed  but  what most encreased the hatred of the people against them  was the selling pardons and absolutions for sin at certain stated prices  A deacon  or subdeacon  who should commit murder  was absolved from his crime  and allowed to possess three benefices  upon paying twenty crowns  A Bishop or an Abbot might commit murder for ten pounds  Every crime had its stated price  and absolutions were given  not only for sins already committed  but for such as should be committed hereafter  The wisest of the people looked with silent detestation on these impositions  and the ignorant  whom nature seemed to have formed for slavery  began to open their eyes to such glaring absurdities   There arose  at last  a champion to rescue human nature from its degeneracy  This was the famous Martin Luther  Leo X  being employed in building the church of St  Peter s at Rome  in the year 1519  in order to procure money for carrying on this project  he gave a commission for selling indulgences  or  in other words  a deliverance from the pains of purgatory  either for one s self or their friends  There were every where shops opened  where these were sold  but  in general  they were to be had at taverns and such like places  These indulgences were granted to the Dominican friars to be distributed by them  whereas   237
