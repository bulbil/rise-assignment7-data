 brother   you best know the trim of your own frigate    The courier  finding he had to do with people who would not be easily  persuaded out of their own opinions  returned to the temple  and made a  report of what he had seen and heard  to the no small consolation of  the bride  who had begun to discover some signs of disquiet  Composed   however  by this piece of intelligence  she exerted her patience for the  space of another half hour  during which period  seeing no bridegroom  arrive  she was exceedingly alarmed  so that all the spectators could  easily perceive her perturbation  which manifested itself in frequent  palpitations  heart heavings  and alterations of countenance  in spite  of the assistance of a smelling bottle which she incessantly applied to  her nostrils   Various were the conjectures of the company on this occasion  some    6 22 15  3 45 PM   imagined he had mistaken the place of rendezvous  as he had never been  at church since he first settled in that parish  others believed he  had met with some accident  in consequence of which his attendants had  carried him back to his own house  and a third set  in which the bride  herself was thought to be comprehended  could not help suspecting  that the commodore had changed his mind  But all these suppositions   ingenious as they were  happened to be wide of the true cause that  detained him  which was no other than this  the commodore and his crew  had  by dint of turning  almost weathered the parson s house that stood  to windward of the church  when the notes of a pack of hounds unluckily  reached the ears of the two hunters which Trunnion and the lieutenant  bestrode  These fleet animals no sooner heard the enlivening sound   than  eager for the chase  they sprang away all of a sudden  and  strained every nerve to partake of the sport  flew across the fields  with incredible speed  overleaped hedges and ditches  and everything  in their way  without the least regard to their unfortunate riders  The  lieutenant  whose steed had got the heels of the other  finding it would  be great folly and presumption in him to pretend to keep the saddle with  his wooden leg  very wisely took the opportunity of throwing himself off  in his passage through a field of rich clover  among which he lay at his  ease  and seeing his captain advancing  at full gallop  hailed him with  the salutation of  What cheer  Ho   The commodore  who was in infinite  distress  eyeing him askance as he passed  replied  with a faltering  voice   O  d   ye   you are safe at an anchor  I wish to God I were as  fast moored    Nevertheless  conscious of his disabled heel  he would not venture  to try the experiment which had succeeded so well with Hatchway but  resolved to stick as close as possible to his horse s back  until  Providence should interpose in his behalf  With this view he dropped his  whip  and with his right hand laid fast hold on the pommel  contracting  every muscle in his body to secure himself in the seat  and grinning  most formidably in consequence of this exertion  In this attitude he  was hurried on a considerable way  when all of a sudden his view was  comforted by a five bar gate that appeared before him  as he never  doubted that there the career of his hunter must necessarily end   But  alas  he reckoned without his host  Far from halting at this  obstruction  the horse sprang over it with amazing agility  to the utter  confusion and disorder of his owner  who lost his hat and periwig in  the leap  and now began to think  in good earnest  that he was actually  mounted on the back of the devil  He recommended himself to God  his  reflections forsook him  his eyesight and all his other senses failed   he quitted the reins  and fastening by instinct on the mane  was in this  condition conveyed into the midst of the sportsmen  who were astonished  at the sight of such an apparition  Neither was their surprise to be  wondered at  if we reflect on the figure that presented itself to their  view  The commodore s person was at all times an object of admiration   much more so on this occasion  when every singularity was aggravated by  the circumstances of his dress and disaster   He had put on  in honour of his nuptials  his best coat of blue  broad cloth  cut by a tailor of Ramsgate  and trimmed with five dozen  of brass buttons large and small  his breeches were of the same piece   fastened at the knees with large bunches of tape  his waistcoat was of  red plush lappelled with green velvet  and garnished with vellum holes   his boots bore an infinite resemblance  both in colour and shape  to a  pair of leather buckets  his
