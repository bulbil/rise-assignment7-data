with her  but his happiness is by no means of the same kind with yours and mine  she is beautiful  and he thinks her so  she is amiable  and he esteems her  he prefers her to all other women  but he feels nothing of that trembling delicacy of sentiment  that quick sensibility  which gives to love its most exquisite pleasures  and which I would not give up for the wealth of worlds       His affection is meer passion  and therefore subject to change  ours is that heartfelt tenderness  which time renders every moment more pleasing       The tumult of desire is the fever of the soul  its health  that delicious tranquillity where the heart is gently moved  not violently agitated  that tranquillity which is only to be found where friendship is the basis of love  and where we are happy without injuring the object beloved  in other words  in a marriage of choice       In the voyage of life  passion is the tempest  love the gentle gale       Dissipation  and a continued round of amusements at home  will probably secure my sister all of Temple s heart which remains  but his love would grow languid in that state of retirement  which would have a thousand charms for minds like ours       I will own to you  I have fears for Lucy s happiness       But let us drop so painful a subject       Adieu    Your affectionate  ED  RIVERS     LETTER CCI   201   To Colonel RIVERS  Bellfield  Rutland   Oct  19   NOTHING  my dear Rivers  shews the value of friendship more than the envy it excites        The world will sooner pardon us any advantage  even wealth  genius  or beauty  than that of having a faithful friend  every selfish bosom swells with envy at the sight of those social connexions  which are the cordials of life  and of which our narrow prejudices alone prevent our enjoyment       Those who have neither hearts to feel this generous affection  nor merit to deserve it  hate all who are in this respect happier than themselves  they look on a friend as an invaluable blessing  and a blessing out of their reach  and abhor all who possess the treasure for which they sigh in vain       For my own part  I had rather be the dupe of a thousand false professions of friendship  than  for fear of being deceived  give up the pursuit       Dupes are happy at least for a time  but the cold  narrow  suspicious heart never knows the glow of social pleasure       In the same proportion as we lose our confidence in the virtues of others  we lose our proper happiness       The observation of this mean jealousy  so humiliating to human nature  has influenced Lord Halifax  in his Advice to a Daughter  the school of art  prudery  and selfish morals  to caution her against all friendships  or  as he calls them  dearnesses  as what will make the world envy and hate her       After my sweet Bell s tenderness  I know no pleasure equal to your friendship  nor would I give it up for the revenue of an eastern monarch       I esteem Temple  I love his conversation  he is gay and amusing  but I shall never have for him the affection I feel for you        I think you are too apprehensive in regard to your sister s happiness  he loves her  and there is a certain variety in her manner  a kind of agreable caprice  that I think will secure the heart of a man of his turn  much more than her merit  or even the loveliness of her person       She is handsome  exquisitely so  handsomer than Bell  and  if you will allow me to say so  than Emily       I mean  that she is so in the eye of a painter  for in that of a lover his mistress is the only beautiful object on earth       I allow your sister to be very lovely  but I think Bell more desirable a thousand times  and  rationally speaking  she who has  as to me  the art of inspiring the most tenderness is  as to me  to all intents and purposes the most beautiful woman       In which faith I chuse to live and die       I have an idea  Rivers  that you and I shall continue to be happy  a real sympathy  a lively taste  mixed with esteem  led us to marry  the delicacy  tenderness  and virtue  of the two most charming of women  promise to keep our love alive       We have both strong affections  both love the conversation of women  and neither of our hearts are depraved by ill chosen connexions with the sex       I am broke in upon  and must bid you adieu   Your affectionate  J  FITZGERALD       Bell is writing to you  I shall be jealous     LETTER CCII   202   To Colonel RIVERS  Bellfield  Rutland   London  Oct
