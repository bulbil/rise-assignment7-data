and surely in that time you had opportunities enough of carrying your point  either by marriage  or a more expeditious   188 method—you understand me  — No  by all that s good   replied he   strange as it may appear—I was totally disappointed of success —She was in a violent fever the principal part of the time  and  in the intervals of her recovery  nothing could either perswade or terrify her into an acceptance of me —The few friends who were in the secret  advised me to proceed by other means  and laughed incessantly on account of my romantic purity of affection  as they termed it  for a cast mistress —Their ridicule too was the more severe  because I had been myself one of the very wildest in the whole knot  and had taken such liberties at various times with the sex  as rendered my present behaviour to the last degree extraordinary —There is nothing which we can stand so little as the shaft of ridicule —I was a   189 thousand times determined to prosecute their advice—and frequently blushed in secret at the littleness of my conduct  in thinking of Miss Mildmay for a wife—Yet my unaccountable love got the better of my shame  and I was terrified from attempting any actual violation  because I knew the greatness of her spirit  and was apprehensive  that  in such a case  she might lay a desperate hand upon her person —She had repeatedly threatened as much  and  I am positive  would have been as good as her word      It is wonderful   interrupted I    that some of your friends did not speak of her being with you—that none of your servants  as you were so near a neighbour of the Mildmays  did not  at some time  write to their friends in the country about the   190 young lady—or  that the physicians  —      O  the easiest things in the world to manage   cried Sir Harry—  I had secrets of my friends  as a security for the preservation of mine—my servants were all true to the back bone  and had been tried a thousand times—and as for the physicians—an additional fee made them as silent as the grave at any time   —     Well   interrogated I    and was it possible that she could escape at last out of your hands  without rewarding you for all the trouble which you were at upon her account      It was possible   replied Sir Harry    because she did—and I will tell you by what unfortunate accident —A parcel of us had been making merry   191 one evening below stairs  and we were all pretty well in for it  before we thought of going to bed—For my part  though I had drank very near four bottles  I had no inclination to undress—I therefore took up a volume of Tristram Shandy  which lay by the bed side  and continued so long at this  that nature was at last wearied out  and I sunk insensibly into so found a sleep  that it was with much difficulty they could wake me  when the house was in flames—for the bed curtains  by some means  reaching my candle  the whole furniture was instantly in a blaze  and the fire  I suppose  spread through the other apartments with the greatest rapidity —in the confusion occasioned by this unlucky circumstance  Miss Mildmay contrived to make her escape  and though  the moment her flight was discovered  I   192 posted messengers through all the different roads  and even continued an indefatigable search after her for above two months  I never could gain any satisfactory account —Tired out at length with a search which was productive of nothing but disappointment and mortification  I gave her over  and quitted England  in hopes that distance and time would mitigate the distresses of my mind  if it could not even restore my tranquillity —So much  Sir  for Miss Mildmay—and now I have been so communicative  I hope you will not think me impertinent  if I ask your name  and beg to know which part of England is favoured with your residence      That   returned I    you shall soon know—My name is Harold —I have an estate in Somersetshire—but my   193 principal residence  when I am in England  is in Grosvenor Square   —    Have you ever  my dear Charles  particularly remarked Garrick  in the second act  I think it is  of Lear  where Goneril has struck off one half of his followers  and the poor old king tells his melancholly tale to Regan  from whom he expects to meet the most dutiful returns of filial gratitude and affection—Have you  I say  remarked the intense  the inexpressible astonishment of the venerable monarch  when  instead of receiving the least consolation from the only child of which he now reckons himself possessed  the unnatural harpy aggravates the indignity he has suffered  and desires him even to dismiss one half of those knights  which have yet been spared him by her infamous sister —If you recollect the face of our modern Roscius in that celebrated scene  you   194 will have some tolerable idea of the amazement which this reply instantly spread over the whole
