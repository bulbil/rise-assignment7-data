 as looked more like madness than generosity  He had no communication with your rich yeomen  but rather treated them and their families with studied contempt  because forsooth they pretended to assume the dress and manners of the gentry    They kept their footmen  their saddle horses  and chaises  their wives and daughters appeared in their jewels  their silks  and their satins  their negligees and trollopees  their clumsy shanks  like so many shins of beef  were cased in silk hose and embroidered slippers  their raw red fingers  gross as the pipes of a chamber organ  which had been employed in milking the cows  in twirling the mop or churn staff  being adorned with diamonds  were taught to thrum the pandola  and even to touch the keys of the harpsichord  Nay  in every village they kept a rout  and set up an assembly  and in one place a hog butcher was master of the ceremonies    I have heard Mr  Greaves ridicule them for their vanity and awkward imitation  and therefore  I believe  he avoided all concerns with them  even when they endeavoured to engage his attention  It was the lower sort of people with whom he chiefly conversed  such as ploughmen  ditchers  and other day labourers  To every cottager in the parish he was a bounteous benefactor  He was  in the literal sense of the word  a careful overseer of the poor  for he went from house to house  industriously inquiring into the distresses of the people  He repaired their huts  clothed their backs  filled their bellies  and supplied them with necessaries for exercising their industry and different occupations    I ll give you one instance now  as a specimen of his character —He and I  strolling one day on the side of a common  saw two boys picking hips and haws from the hedges  one seemed to be about five  and the other a year older  they were both barefoot and ragged  but at the same time fat  fair  and in good condition   Who do you belong to   said Mr  Greaves   To Mary Stile   replied the oldest   the widow that rents one of them housen    And how dost live  my boy  Thou lookest fresh and jolly   resumed the squire   Lived well enough till yesterday   answered the child   And pray what happened yesterday  my boy   continued Mr  Greaves   Happened   said he   why  mammy had a coople of little Welsh keawes  that gi en milk enough to fill all our bellies  mammy s  and mine  and Dick s here  and my two little sisters  at hoam —Yesterday the squire seized the keawes for rent  God rot un  Mammy s gone to bed sick and sulky  my two sisters be crying at hoam vor vood  and Dick and I be come hither to pick haws and bullies     My godfather s face grew red as scarlet  he took one of the children in either hand  and leading them towards the house  found Sir Everhard talking with my father before the gate  Instead of avoiding the old gentleman  as usual  he brushed up to him with a spirit he had never shown before  and presenting the two ragged boys   Surely  sir   said he   you will not countenance that there ruffian  your steward  in oppressing the widow and fatherless  On pretence of distraining for the rent of a cottage  he has robbed the mother of these and other poor infant orphans of two cows  which afforded them their whole sustenance  Shall you be concerned in tearing the hard earned morsel from the mouth of indigence  Shall your name  which has been so long mentioned as a blessing  be now detested as a curse by the poor  the helpless  and forlorn  The father of these babes was once your gamekeeper  who died of a consumption caught in your service —You see they are almost naked—I found them plucking haws and sloes  in order to appease their hunger  The wretched mother is starving in a cold cottage  distracted with the cries of other two infants  clamorous for food  and while her heart is bursting with anguish and despair  she invokes Heaven to avenge the widow s cause upon the head of her unrelenting landlord     This unexpected address brought tears into the eyes of the good old gentleman   Will Clarke   said he to my father   how durst you abuse my authority at this rate  You who know I have always been a protector  not an oppressor of the needy and unfortunate  I charge you  go immediately and comfort this poor woman with immediate relief  instead of her own cows  let her have two of the best milch cows of my dairy  they shall graze in my parks in summer  and be foddered with my hay in winter —She shall sit rent free for life  and I will take care of these her poor orphans     This was a very affecting scene  Mr  Launcelot took his father s hand and kissed it  while the tears ran down his cheeks  and Sir Everhard embraced his
