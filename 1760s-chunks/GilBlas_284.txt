waited with impatience for the entrance of my faithful Scipio  since I could not doubt him to be the man  nor was I mistaken in my conjecture  He was introduced at the time appointed  and his joy  which only mine could equal  broke forth into the most whimsical demonstrations  On my side  in the ecstasy of delight  I stretched out my arms to him  and he rushed into them with no courtly measured embrace  All distinctions of master and dependent were levelled in the sympathetic rapture of our meeting   When our transports had subsided a little  I inquired into the state of my household  You have neither household nor house  answered he  to spare you a long string of questions  I will sum up your worldly concerns in two words  Your property has been pillaged at both ends  both by the banditti of the law and by your own retainers  who  regarding you as a ruined man  paid themselves their own wages out of whatever they found that was portable  Luckily for you  I had the dexterity to save from their harpy clutches two large bags of double pistoles  Salero  in whose custody I deposited them  will make restitution on your release  which cannot be far distant  as you were put upon his majesty s pension list of prisoners without the Duke of Lerma s knowledge or consent   I asked Scipio how he knew his excellency to have had no share in my arrest  You may depend on it  answered he  my information is undeniable  One of my friends in the Duke of Uzeda s confidence acquainted me with all the circumstances of your imprisonment  Calderona  having discovered by a spy that Signora Sirena  with the handle of an alias to her name  was receiving night visits from the Prince of Spain  and that the Count de Lemos managed that intrigue by the panderism of Signor de Santillane  determined to be revenged on the whole knot  To this end he waited on the Duke of Uzeda  and discovered the whole affair  The duke  overjoyed at such a fine opportunity of ruining his enemy  did not fail to bestir himself  He laid his information before the king  and painted the prince s danger in the most lively colours  His majesty was much angered  and shewed that he was so  by sending Sirena to the nunnery provided for such frail sisters  banishing the Count de Lemos  and condemning Gil Blas to perpetual imprisonment   This  pursued Scipio  is what my friend told me  Hence  you gather your misfortune to be the Duke of Uzeda s handiwork  or rather Calderona s   Thus it seemed probable that my affairs might be reinstated in time  that the Duke of Lerma  chagrined at his nephew s banishment  would move heaven and earth for that nobleman s recall  and it might not be too much to expect that his excellency would not forget me  What a delicate gipsy is hope  She wheedled me out of all anxiety about my shattered fortunes  and made me as light hearted as if I had good reason to be so  My prison looked not like the dungeon of perpetual misery  but like the vestibule to a more distinguished station  For thus ran the train of my reasoning  Don Fernando Borgia  Father Jerome of Florence  and more than all  Friar Louis of Aliaga  who may thank him for his place about the king s person  are the prime minister s partisans  With the aid of such powerful friends  his excellency will bear down all opposition  even supposing no change to take place in the political barometer  But his majesty s health is very precarious  The first act of a new reign would be to recall the Count de Lemos  he would not feel himself at home in the young monarch s presence till he had introduced me at court  and the young monarch would not sit easy on his throne till he had showered benefits on my head  Thus  feasting by anticipation on the pleasures of futurity  I became callous to existing evils  The two bags  snug in the goldsmith s custody  were no bad doubles to the part which hope acted in this shifting pantomime   It was impossible not to express my gratitude to Scipio for his zeal and honesty  I offered him half the salvage  but he rejected it  I expect  said he  a very different acknowledgment  Astonished as much at his mysterious claim as at his refusal  I asked what more I could do for him  Let us never part  answered he  Allow me to link my fate with yours  I feel for you what I never felt for any other master  And on my part  my good fellow  said I  you may rest assured that your attachment is not thrown away  You caught my fancy at first sight  We must have been born under Libra or Gemini  where friendship is lord of the ascendant  I willingly accept your proffered partnership  and will commence business by prevailing with the warden to immure you along with me in this tower  That is the very thing  exclaimed he  You were beforehand with me  for I was just going to beg that favour  Your company is dearer to me than liberty itself  I
