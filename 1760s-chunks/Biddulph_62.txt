Arnold’s entertaining a doubt of my true affection for him  I would not live in this suspence for millions  I would rather he should treat me roughly—if I discovered that to be his humour  though it would frighten me  yet should I patiently conform to it   August 30  That which was ever the terror of my thoughts is come upon me—Mr Arnold—Ah  my dear Cecilia  Mr Arnold is no longer the same  Coldness and indifference have at length succeeded to love  to complacency  and the fondest attention—What a change  but the cause  my dear  that remains a secret locked up in his own breast  It cannot be that a whisper  an idle rumour should affect him thus  What if he has heard that Mr Faulkland loved me once  That we were to have been married  Cannot he ask me the question  I long to set his heart at ease—yet cannot mention the affair first  after so long    a silence  it would look like a consciousness  A consciousness of what  I have nothing to accuse myself of   September 1  I am no longer in doubt —The cause  the fatal cause of Mr Arnold’s change is discovered  This miserable day has disclosed the secret to me  a black  a complicated scene of mischief   Mr Arnold rode out this morning  He told me he was to dine with a gentleman at some miles distance  and should not return till late in the evening   He was but just gone  when a lady of my acquaintance called in upon me  to request I would go with her to a play  that was to be performed at night  You must know we have had a company of players in the neighbourhood for some time past  and it was to one of those poor people’s benefits that she desired my company  I promised to attend her  though you know I don’t much admire those sort of entertainments in the country  and seldom go to them   The lady and her husband called upon me at the appointed hour  and I went with them in their coach  The place which the players had fitted up for their purpose  had formerly been a pretty large schoolroom  and could  with the addition of a gallery  which they had made  with ease contain above three hundred people  The play had been bespoke by some of the principal ladies in the neighbourhood  who had used all their interest for the performer  so that the house was as full as it could hold  The audience consisting chiefly of fashionable people  it was with difficulty that we reached the places which were kept for us in the pit  as they happened to be on the bench next the stage  and the door was at the other end of the house  The first object that I observed on my coming in was Mr Faulkland  he bowed to me at a distance  but made no attempts to approach me  The play was come to the latter end of the fourth act  and the curtain was let down to make some preparation on the stage  when we were alarmed with the cry of fire   It happened that the carpenters  who had been employed in fitting up this extempore theatre  had left a heap of shavings in a little place behind the stage  which had been converted into a dressing room  a little boy belonging to the company had found a candle in it  and having piled up the shavings  set them on fire  and left them burning  the flame communicated itself to some dry boards which lay in the room  and in a few minutes the whole was in a blaze  Some persons  who heard the crackling of the wood  opened the door  when the    flame burst out with such violence  that the scenes were presently on fire  and the curtain  which as I told you was dropt  soon caught it   The consternation and terror of the poor people  whose all was destroying  is not to be described  the women shrieking  threw themselves off the stage into the pit  as the smoke and flames terrified them from attempting to get out any other way  though there was a door behind the stage   The audience were in little less confusion than they  for as the house was composed chiefly of wood  every one expected it would soon be consumed to ashes   The horror and distraction of my mind almost deprived me of the power of motion  My life was in imminent danger  for I was scorched with the fire before I could get at any distance from the stage  though the people were rushing out as fast as they could   The lady who was with me was exceedingly frightned  but being under her husband’s care  had a little more courage than I had  He caught her round the waist  and lifted her over the benches  which were very high  giving me what assistance he could with his other hand  But the terror and hurry I was in occasioned my foot to slip  and I fell between two of the benches  and sprained my ancle   Some people pushing to get out  rushed between me and my company  the excessive pain I felt  joined to
