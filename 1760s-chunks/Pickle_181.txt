the  conversation  and  in the impatience of his love  conjured him to  consent to his happiness  protesting  that he would comply with any  terms of settlement that a man of his fortune could embrace  in favour  of a young lady who was absolute mistress of his affection   Our youth thanked him very politely for his favourable sentiments and  honourable intention towards his sister  and told him  that at present  he saw no reason to obstruct his desire  that he would consult Julia s  own inclinations  and confer with him about the means of gratifying his  wish  but  in the meantime  begged to be excused from discussing any    6 22 15  3 45 PM   point of such importance to them both  Reminding him of the jovial  purpose on which they were happily met  he promoted such a quick  circulation of the bottle  that their mirth grew noisy and obstreperous   they broke forth into repeated peals of laughter  without any previous  incitement except that of claret  These explosions were succeeded by  Bacchanalian songs  in which the old gentleman himself attempted to  bear a share  the sedate governor snapped time with his fingers  and the  parish priest assisted in the chorus with a most expressive nakedness  of countenance  Before midnight they were almost all pinned to their  chairs  as if they had been fixed by the power of enchantment  and  what  rendered the confinement still more unfortunate  every servant in the  house was in the same situation  so that they were fain to take their  repose as they sat  and nodded at each other like a congregation of  Anabaptists   Next day Peregrine communed with his sister on the subject of her match  with Mr  Clover  who  she told him  had offered to settle a jointure of  four hundred pounds  and take her to wife without any expectation of a  dowry  She moreover gave him to understand  that  in his absence  she  had received several messages from her mother  commanding her to return  to her father s house  but that she had refused to obey these orders   by the advice and injunction of her aunt and the commodore  which were  indeed seconded by her own inclination  because she had all the reason  in the world to believe  that her mother only wanted an opportunity of  treating her with severity and rancour  The resentment of that lady  had been carried to such indecent lengths  that  seeing her daughter at  church one day  she rose up  before the parson entered  and reviled her  with great bitterness  in the face of the whole congregation   CHAPTER LXVII   Sees his Sister happily married  Visits Emilia  who receives him  according to his Deserts   Her brother being of opinion  that Mr  Clover s proposal was not to  be neglected  especially as Julia s heart was engaged in his favour   communicated the affair to his uncle  who  with the approbation of  Mrs  Trunnion  declared himself well satisfied with the young man s  addresses  and desired that they might be buckled with all expedition   without the knowledge or concurrence of her parents  to whom  on account  of their unnatural barbarity  she was not bound to pay the least regard   Though our adventurer entertained the same sentiments of the matter   and the lover  dreading some obstruction  earnestly begged the immediate  condescension of his mistress  she could not be prevailed upon to take  such a material step  without having first solicited the permission of  her father  resolved  nevertheless  to comply with the dictates of her  own heart  should his objections be frivolous or unjust   Urged by this determination  her admirer waited upon Mr  Gamaliel at the  public house  and  with the appearance of great deference and respect   made him acquainted with his affection for his daughter  communicated  the particulars of his fortune  with the terms of settlement he was    6 22 15  3 45 PM   ready to make  and in conclusion told him  that he would marry her  without a portion  This last offer seemed to have some weight with the  father  who received it with civility  and promised in a day or two to  favour him with a final answer to his demand  He  accordingly  that same  evening consulted his wife  who  being exasperated at the prospect of  her daughter s independency  argued with the most virulent expostulation  against the match  as an impudent scheme of her own planning  with a  view of insulting her parents  towards whom she had already been guilty  of the most vicious disobedience  In short  she used such remonstrances   as not only averted this weak husband s inclination from the proposal  which he had relished before  but even instigated him to apply for a  warrant to apprehend his daughter  on the supposition that she was about  to bestow herself in marriage without his privity or consent   The justice of peace to whom this application was made  though he could
