looked quick about her  as if for Somebody  Laura  her maid  was occasionally called upon  She started  and threw her arms about Camilla  as terrified  looking wildly  Camilla doubts not  but by the name Laura  she apprehended the savage Laurana to be at hand   How must she have suffered from her barbarity▪—Sweet Innocent  she  who even in her ••sveries thought not but of good to the Soul of the man whom she honoured with her regard—She  who bore offence   294 without resentment  and by meekness only sought to calm the violence for which she had not given the least cause   But when Camilla and she had retired  she spoke to her  The Bishop gave me the following dialogue between them  as he had it from Camilla   Did they not name to me the Chevalier Grandison  said she   They did  madam   See  see  said she  before I name him again  if my cruel cousin hearken not at the door   Your cruel cousin  madam  is at many miles distance   She may hear what I say  for all that   My dear Lady Clementina  she cannot hear  She shall never more come near you   So you say   Did I ever deceive you  madam   I can t remember  My memory is gone  quite gone  Camilla   She then looked earnestly at Camilla  and screamed   What ails you  my dearest young Lady   Recovering herself—Ah  my own Camilla  It is you  I thought  by the cast of your eye  you were become Laurana —Do not  do not give me such another look   Camilla was not sensible of any particularity in her looks   Here you have me again upon a journey  Camilla  But how do I know that I am not to be carried to my cruel cousin   You are really going to your father s palace at Bologna  madam   Is my mother there   She is   Who else   The Chevalier  madam   What Chevalier     295 Grandison   Impossible  Is he not in proud England   He is come over  madam   What for   With a skilful English surgeon  in hopes to cure Signor Jeronymo—  Poor Jeronymo   And to pay his compliments to you  madam   Flatterer  How many hundred times have I been told so   Should you wish to see him  madam   See whom   The Chevalier Grandison   Once I should  and sighed   And not now  madam   No  I have lost all I had to say to him  Yet I wish I were allowed to go to that England  We poor women are not suffered to go any whither  while men—  There she stopt  and Camilla could not make her say any more   The Bishop was fond of repeating these particulars  as she had not  for some time  talked so much  and so sensibly   Friday Evening   I PASS more than half my time with Signor Jeronymo  but  that I may not fatigue his spirits  at different hours of the day  The Italian surgeons and Mr  Lowther happily agree in all their measures  They applaud him when his back is turned  and he speaks well of them in their absence  This mutual return of good offices  which they hear of  unites them  The patient declares  that he had not for months been so easy as now  Every body attributes a great deal to his heart s being revived by my frequent visits  To morrow it is proposed to make an opening below the most difficult wound  Mr  Lowther says  he will not flatter us  till he sees the success of this operation     296 The Marquis and his Lady are inexpressibly obliging to me  I had yesterday a visit from both  on an indisposition that confined me to my chamber  occasioned  I believe  by a hurry of spirits  by fatigue  by my apprehensions for Jeronymo  my concern for Clementina  and by my too great anxiety for the dear friends I had so lately left in England   You know  Dr  Bartlett  that I have a heart too susceptible for my own peace  tho  I endeavour to conceal from others those painful sensibilities  which they cannot relieve  The poor Olivia was ever to be my disturbance  Miss Byron must be happy in the rectitude of her own heart  I am ready to think  that she will not be able to resist the warm instances of the Countess of D  in favour of her son  who is certainly one of the best young men among the nobility  She will be the happiest woman in the world  as she is one of the most deserving  if she be as happy as I wish her   Emily takes up a large portion of my thoughts   Our Beauchamp I know must be happy  So must my Lord W   my Sisters  and their Lords —Why then shall I not think myself so  God restore Jeronymo  and his Sister  and I must  I will
