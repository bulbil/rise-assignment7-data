was terrified  was not   humbled  and he stood expecting the event  whether evil or good  rather   with obduracy than courage        Thou seest   says the Appearance   a Genius  whom the daring purpose of   thy mind has convoked from the middle region  where he was appointed to   wait the signal  and who is now permitted to act in concert with thy   will  Is not this the language of thy heart    Whatever pleasure I can   snatch from the hand of time  as he passes by me  I will secure for   myself  my passions shall be strong  that my enjoyments may be great    for what is the portion allotted to man  but the joyful madness that   prolongs the hours of festivity  the fierce delight that is extorted   from injury by revenge  and the sweet succession of varied pleasures   which the wish that is ever changing prepares for love          Whatever thou art   said ALMORAN   whose voice has thus disclosed the   secret of my soul  accept my homage  for I will worship thee  and be   thou henceforth my wisdom and my strength         Arise   said the Genius   for therefore am I sent  To thy own powers    mine shall be superadded  and if  as weak only  thou hast been wretched    henceforth thou shalt be happy  Take no thought for to morrow    to morrow  my power shall be employed in thy behalf  Be not affrighted   at any prodigy  but put thy confidence in me   While he was yet speaking   and the eyes of ALMORAN were fixed upon him  a cloud gathered round him    and the next moment dissolving again into air  he disappeared                CHAP  IX         ALMORAN  when he recovered from his astonishment  and had reflected upon   the prodigy  determined to wait the issue  and refer all his hopes to   the interposition of the Genius  without attempting any thing to retard   the marriage  at which he resolved to be present  that he might improve   any supernatural event which might be produced in his favour       HAMET  in the mean time  was anticipating the morrow with a mixture of   anxiety and pleasure  and though he had no reason to think any thing   could prevent his marriage  yet he wished it was over  with an   impatience that was considerably increased by fear       Though the anticipation of the great event that was now so near  kept   him waking the greatest part of the night  yet he rose early in the   morning  and while he waited till ALMEIDA should be ready to see him  he   was told that OMAR was without  and desired admittance  When he came in    HAMET  who always watched his countenance as a mariner the stars of   heaven  perceived that it was obscured with perplexity and grief   Tell   me   said HAMET   whence is the sorrow that I discover in thy face    I   am sorrowful   said OMAR   not for myself  but for thee   At these words   HAMET stept backward  and fixed his eyes upon OMAR  without power to   speak   Consider  said OMAR   that thou art not a man only  but a   prince  consider also  that immortality is before thee  and that thy   felicity  during the endless ages of immortality  depends upon thyself    fear not  therefore  what thou canst suffer from others  the evil and   the good of life are transient as the morning dew  and over these only   the hand of others can prevail        HAMET  whose attachment to life was strong  and whose expectations of   immediate enjoyment were high  did not feel the force of what OMAR had   said  though he assented to its truth   Tell me   said he   at once    what thou fearest for me  deliver me from the torments of suspense  and   trust my own fortitude to save me from despair    Know then   said OMAR     that thou art hated by ALMORAN  and that he loves ALMEIDA   At this   declaration  the astonishment of HAMET was equal to his concern  and he   was in doubt whether to believe or disbelieve what he heard  but the   moment he recollected the wisdom and integrity of OMAR  his doubts were   at an end  and having recovered from his surprize  he was about to make   such enquiries as might gratify the anxious and tumultuous curiosity   which was excited in his breast  when OMAR
