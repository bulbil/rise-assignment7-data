that I was still ignorant of a great part of the ill usage I  had received  affirming  that  while I lived in his house  he had amused    6 22 15  3 45 PM   himself with all the common women in that town  to some of whom this  gentleman had personally introduced him    At first  I could not believe this imputation  but he supported his  assertion with so many convincing circumstances  that I could no longer  doubt the truth of them  and I felt so much resentment  that my love  vanished immediately into air  Instead of proceeding on my journey to  London  I went back a considerable way  and sent a message desiring to  see him in a little house  about midway between his own habitation and  the town from whence I came  He obeyed my summons  and appeared at  the place appointed  where I reproached him with great bitterness   He pleaded guilty to the charge  so far as acknowledging that he had  corresponded with other women lately  in order to get the better of his  affection for me  but the experiment had failed  and he found that he  should be for ever miserable    I did not look upon this candid confession as a sufficient atonement  for his past dissimulation  and  in the sharpness of my revenge   demanded a settlement  which he peremptorily refused  so that for the  present we held each other in the utmost contempt  Indeed  I afterwards  despised myself for my condescension  which was owing to the advice  of my companion  supported and inflamed by the spirit of resentment   Nevertheless  he begged that I would return to his house  or stay all  night where I was  but I was deaf to his entreaties  and  after a great  deal of ironical civility on my side  I took my leave  and went away   yet  before I set out  I looked back  and saw him on horseback  with  such an air of simplicity and truth  as called up a profound sigh   notwithstanding all that had passed in our conversation    Upon my arrival in London  I took lodgings in Leicester fields  and  answered a letter which I had some months before received from my lord   telling him that I would go home to him  without stipulating for any  terms  to try what effect my confidence would have upon his generosity   He readily embraced the offer  and took a house in St  James s street   where I proposed to comply with his humour in everything that was  consistent with my own peace and tranquility    Meanwhile  my lover passed his time very disagreeably in the country   with his friend  of whom  it seems  he had conceived some jealousy   which was increased by a letter I wrote to that gentleman  till he was  made acquainted with the contents  which he read over forty times  and  then his passion breaking out with more violence than ever  he not only  expressed his feeling  in an epistle which I immediately received  but  when he came to town suffered such agonies of despair as I had never  seen before  except in Lord B    It was then in my power to have taken  ample revenge upon him  as well as upon my insolent rival  who had  insisted upon my leaving his house in a very abrupt manner  though he  absolutely refused to gratify her malice  for he was now disposed to  do anything for my satisfaction  But I knew his worth  and had too much  regard for his reputation to advise him to act inconsistent with his  honour    About this time  many tender feelings and sorrowful partings happened  between us  till the marriage knot was tied  when he sent me a bank note  for a thousand pounds  by way of specimen  as he called it  of his  friendship  and of what he would do for me  should I ever want his  assistance  This mark of his generosity I received in a most tender    6 22 15  3 45 PM   billet  which I shall never part with  together with his picture set in  diamonds    I now employed my thoughts in keeping measures with my lord  we lay  in the same apartment  and for the first four or five months I neither  dined nor supped abroad above twice  and then he knew where I was  and  approved of my company  But all this complacency and circumspection had  no effect upon his temper  which remained as capricious and dissatisfied  as ever  Nay  to such a provoking degree did this unhappy humour  prevail  that one day  in the presence of his lawyer  he harangued upon  my misconduct since our last reunion  and very freely affirmed  that  every step I had taken was diametrically opposite to his will    Conscious of the pains I had been at to please him  I was so incensed  at these unjust invectives  that  starting up
