 with which you puzzle yourself  and bewilder me  You see I follow your lead  As to the other part of your question  for I would always answer directly  when I can   my friend Beauchamp deserves the best of women  You are excellent in my eyes  but I have known two very worthy persons  who  taken separately  have been admired by every one who knew them  and who admired each other before marriage  yet not happy in it   Miss Gr  Is it possible  To what could their unhappiness be owing —Both  I suppose  continuing good   Sir Ch  To an hundred almost nameless reasons—Too little consideration on one side  too much on the other  Diversions different  Too much abroad the man—Too much at home will sometimes have the same effect  Acquaintance approved by the one—Disapproved by the other  One liking the town    145 the other the country  Or either preferring town or country in different humours  or at different times of the year  Human nature  Charlotte—  Miss Gr  No more  no more  I beseech you  brother—Why this human nature  I believe  is a very vile thing  I think  Lady L  I won t marry at all   Sir Ch  Some such trifles  as these I have enumerated  will be likely to make you  Charlotte  with all your excellencies  not so happy as I wish you to be  If you cannot have a man of whose understanding you have an higher opinion than of your own  you should think of one who is likely to allow to yours a superiority  If—  Miss Grandison interrupted him again  I wished she would not so often interrupt him  I wanted to find out his notions of our sex  I am afraid  with all his politeness  he thinks us poor creatures  But why should not the character of a good  a prudent woman  be as great as that of a good  a prudent man   Miss Gr  Well  but  Sir  I suppose the gentleman abroad has more understanding than I have   Sir Ch  A good deal will depend upon what you ll think of that  Not what I  or the world  will judge   Miss Gr  But the judgment of us women generally goes with the world   Sir Ch  Not generally  in matrimonial instances  A wife  in general  may allow of a husband s superior judgment  but in particular cases  and as they fall out one by one  the man may find it difficult  to have at allowed in any one instance   Miss Gr  I think you said  Sir  that batchelors were close observers   Sir Ch  We may in the sister  sometimes  see the wife  I admire you  myself  for your vivacity  but I am not sure that a husband would not think himself hurt by it  especially if it be true  as you say     that Charlotte has not much reflexion  and is apt to   146 speak as the humour comes upon her  without troubling herself about the fit or the unfit      Miss Gr  O  Sir  what a memory you have  I hope that the man who is to call me his  that s the dialect  i n t it   will not have half your memory   Sir Ch  For his sake  or your own  do you hope this  Charlotte   Miss Gr  Let me see—Why for both our sakes  I believe   Sir Ch  You ll tell the man  in courtship  I hope  that all this liveliness is    constitution    and   that you know not how to cure it      Miss Gr  No  by no means  Sir  Let him in the mistress  as somebody else in the sister  guess at the wife  and take warning   Sir Ch  Very well answered  Charlotte  in the play we are at  but I am willing to think highly of my sister s prudence  and that she will be happy  and make the man so  to whom she may think fit to give her hand at the altar  And now the question recurs  What shall I say to Lord G   What to Sir Walter   Miss Gr  Why I think you must make my compliments to Sir Walter  if you will be so good  and  after the example of my sister Harriet to the men she sends a grazing  very civilly tell him  he may break his heart as soon as he pleases  for that I cannot be his   Sir Ch  Strange girl  But I wish not to lower this lively spirit—You will put your determination into English   Miss Gr  In plain English  then  I can by no means think of encouraging the address of Sir Walter Watkyns   Sir Ch  Well  And what shall I say to Lord G    Miss Gr  Why that s the thing —I was afraid it would come to this—Why  Sir  you must tell him  I think—I profess I can
