people  and the vast armies they brought into the field  I am apt to doubt his veracity  Such armies could scarcely be levied  even now  and yet  nothing is more certain  than that Britain is at least ten times more populous now than it was at that time  A nation of herdsmen and hunters can never be very populous  their subsistence takes up a large tract of country  while the husbandman converts every part of nature to human use  and produces the greatest quantity of subsistence from circumscribed possession  The Roman historian has increased their numbers  only to increase the lustre of his glory in subduing them  I am   c                     25  LETTER V   Dear Charles   THE second expedition into Britain was made by Claudius  under the conduct of Plautius  and pursued by Ostorius  and other Roman commanders  with the usual success  It is true  there were many Britons who preferred their hardy simplicity to imported elegance  and  rather than offer their necks to the Roman yoke  presented their breasts to the sword  But  by degrees  their fierceness was subdued  or wholly destroyed  the southern coast  with all the adjacent inland country  was secured by the conquerors  who took possession by fortifying camps  building fortresses  and planting colonies  The rest of the country seemed to look on  patiently waiting till it became their turn to be expelled from their precarious habitations  or to receive their imperious masters   Prosperity  in general  breeds insolence  the corruption of the Praetors and officers  that were appointed to govern this harrassed people  once more roused them into resentment  Caractacus  General and King of the northern Britons  with inferior numbers  not only made a brave defence  but often seemed to claim a doubtful victory  A drawn battle might be considered as a triumph  to a people only used to a defeat  He continued nine years to hold out  and threatened fatal dangers to the Roman colonies  At length  however  in a decisive battle  the Britons were totally defeated  and Caractacus taken prisoner  His exclamation  when led in triumph through Rome  is too remarkable to be passed over in silence  Observing the opulence  splendor  and luxury of that great city    26  Alas  cried he  how is it possible  that people  possessed of such finery at home  could envy me an humble cottage in Britain      Yet  one expiring effort more was made by the Britons  to recover their liberty in the times of Nero  Paulinus  the general of the Romans  going with the greatest part of his forces  to subdue the isle of Anglesey  where the superstitions of the Druids were still practised with all their horrid circumstances  the Britons  presuming upon his absence  made a general insurrection under Boadicea  Queen of the Iceni  whom the Romans had treated with shocking indignities  condemning her  for some slight offence  to be whipped  and her daughters to be ravished by the soldiery  in revenge  therefore  at the head of a numerous army  she fell upon the Romans wherever they were defenceless  took their castles  destroyed the chief seats of their power at London and Verulam  and  such was the slaughter  that seventy thousand fell by this revolt  Paulinus  however  soon returned with his army  encountered the British forces headed by their Queen  overthrew their powers  and pursued his victory with a slaughter of eighty thousand men  while the conquered Queen poisoned herself in despair  Here ended the liberties of Britain  All that now remained were satisfied to exchange freedom for life  this was their last struggle  they now lost  not only the hopes  but even the desire of vindicating the privileges of nature  From this time the Romans seemed more desirous of securing what they possessed  than of making new conquests  they separated the Roman province  by a wall  from the Picts  their barbarous and restless neighbours  and attempted to humanize the   27 fierceness of those who acknowledged their power  The Roman laws and customs  habits and arms  language and manners  baths and feasts  studies and learning  were introduced and became general  A conduct so prudent  which had been first begun by Agricola  was pursued by his successors with so much success  that the Romans had little trouble afterwards in Britain  except in the defence of their northern frontier   Had Rome continued peaceable mistress of the world  the Britons  now almost perfectly civilized  might have found means of being happy  But  upon the divisions in the Roman empire  which was ruled by faction  and governed by an insolent soldiery  torn by sedition at home  and subject to invasion abroad  the British legions were  at several times  called over into Gaul  and  with them  great numbers of the bravest of the British youth  Thus  we see every method pursued  to weaken and render this once hardy people effeminate  The arts of luxury were introduced to soften their minds  they were denied the use of arms  which might still uphold their
