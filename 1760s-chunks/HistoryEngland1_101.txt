been scarce ever molested by a competitor   But external commerce was not more cultivated than internal manufactures  several of the Flemmings  who were persecuted from their own country  by the bad conduct of Spain  found an asylum in England  these more than repaid the protection they found  by the arts which they introduced  and the industry which was thus propagated by their example   Thus far in the useful arts  but  in the polite arts  England excelled all the world  so that many writers fix the Augustan age of literature to that period  The disputes  caused by the reformation of religion  had retarded the progress of our language among the powerful  yet spread a love of literature among the lower orders of the state  The people now began to learn to read  and the Bible  translated into the vulgar tongue  was not   297 only serviceable in improving their morals  but their taste  The persecution of Mary was  however  of great detriment to the language  the reformers  being driven into foreign countries  on their return  introduced  into their sermons  a language compounded of those dialects which they had acquired abroad  and the language of England was actually in a state of barbarity  when Elizabeth came to the throne  Latin sermons were in fashion  and few of the nobility had either the courage  or the taste  to declare themselves the patrons of learning   Either the fortune  or the discernment of Elizabeth  made Parker Archbishop of Canterbury  and he set himself affiduously to reform the corruptions of style  both by precept and example  for this purpose he reviewed and corrected the English translation of the Bible  and printed it with royal magnificence  His own style had all the eloquence of the times  it was manly and concise  but wanted smoothness   The Earl of Essex  a sketch of whose history you have seen  was himself one of the greatest improvers of our language  his education had freed him from the technical barbarities of the schools  and his style ran on unembarrassed by the stiffness of pedantry  His letters  particularly that which he wrote from Ireland to the Queen  are regarded as models of fine writing to this day  Sir Walter Raleigh has the reputation of being one of the improvers of our language  and none can contest with him the honour of being foremost in the improvement of our history  Hooker  the author of the Ecclesiastical Polity  was the first Englishman whose style  upon theological subjects  does honour to his memory  as a scholar and a   298 gentleman  But what particularly deserves notice  is  that a man  like him  bred up in poverty  and seclusion from the polite  should express himself in a more modern and elegant manner than his contemporary authors  Sidney or Raleigh  who were bred at court   I shall mention only one prose writer more  the greatest and wisest of all our English philosophers  and perhaps the greatest philosopher among men  I need hardly mention the name of Francis Bacon  Lord Verulam  his style is copious and correct  and his learning only surpassed by his genius   Among the poets  two of particular note attract our attention  Spenser and Shakespear  to attempt an encomium of either is needless  all praise must be too low for their merits  or unnecessary to make them more known   In short  the English now began to rival the Spaniards  who  at that time  aimed at universal monarchy  both in arts and arms  the city of London became more large and more beautiful  the people of the country began to consider agriculture as one of the most useful and honourable employments  the English were  in power  the second nation in Europe  and they were  shortly  to become the greatest  by becoming the most free   During this reign  a few suffered death for their religious opinions  but we may venture to assert  that they raised the disturbances by which they suffered  for those who lived in quiet were permitted to enjoy their opinions under the necessary restraints   If we look through history  and consider the rise of kingdoms  we shall not find  in all its volumes  such an instance of a nation becoming wise  powerful  and happy  in so short a time    299 The source of our felicity began in Henry VII  and  tho  repressed by the intervening tyrannies  yet  before the end of Elizabeth s reign  who was only his grand daughter  the people became the most polished and the most happy people upon earth  Liberty  it is true  as yet continued to fluctuate  Elizabeth knew her own power  and often stretched it to the very limits of despotism  but  when commerce was introduced  liberty necessarily entered in its train  for there never was a nation perfectly commercial and perfectly despotic   I am   c   LETTER XXXVIII   YOU are now to turn to a reign  which  tho  not splendid  was useful  the English only wanted a season of peace  to bring those arts to perfection which were planted in the preceding reign  No Monarch was fonder of peace than James I  who
