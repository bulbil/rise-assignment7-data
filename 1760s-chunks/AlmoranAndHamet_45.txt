I know not  but he talked of speed    and supposed that the effect was certain        ALMORAN  though he was still impatient to hear of HAMET  and discovered    that if he was dead  his death was unknown to Caled  was yet   notwithstanding rejoiced at what he heard  and as he knew what Caled   told him to be true  as the conversation he related had passed between   himself and HAMET  he exulted in the pleasing confidence that he had yet   a friend  the glooms of suspicion  which had involved his mind  were   dissipated  and his countenance brightened with complacency and joy  He   had delayed to put Osmyn to death  only because he could appoint no man   to succeed him  of whom his fears did not render him equally suspicious    but having now found  in Caled  a friend  whose fidelity had been   approved when there had been no intention to try it  and being impatient   to reward his zeal  and to invest his fidelity with that power  which   would render his services most important  he took a ring from his own   finger  and putting it upon that of Caled   Take this   said he   as a   pledge  that to morrow Osmyn shall lose his head  and that  from this   moment  thou art invested with his power        Caled having  in the conversation between ALMORAN and HAMET  discerned   indubitable treachery  which he imputed to Osmyn whose appearance   ALMORAN had then assumed  eagerly seized the opportunity to destroy him    he  therefore  not trusting to the event of his accusation  had mingled   poison in the bowl which he presented to ALMORAN when he came out from   HAMET  this  however  at first he had resolved to conceal       In consequence of his accusation  he supposed Osmyn would be questioned   upon the rack  he supposed also  that the accusation  as it was true    would be confirmed by his confession  that what ever he should then say   to the prejudice of his accuser  would be disbelieved  and that when   after a few hours the poison should take effect  no inquisition would be   made into the death of a criminal  whom the bow string or the scimitar   would otherwise have been employed to destroy  But he now hoped to   derive new merit from an act of zeal  which ALMORAN had approved before   it was known  by condemning his rival to die  whose death he had already   insured   May the wishes of my lord   said he   be always anticipated    and may it be found  that whatever he ordains is already done  may he   accept the zeal of his servant  whom he has delighted to honour  for    before the light of the morning shall return  the eyes of Osmyn shall   close in everlasting darkness        At these words  the countenance of ALMORAN changed  his cheeks became   pale  and his lips trembled   What then   said he   hast thou done     Caled  who was terrified and astonished  threw himself upon the ground    and was unable to reply  ALMORAN  who now  by the utmost effort of his   mind  restrained his confusion and his fear  that he might learn the   truth from Caled without dissimulation or disguise  raised him from the   ground and repeated his enquiry   If I have erred   said Caled   impute   it not  when I had detected the treachery of Osmyn  I was transported by   my zeal for thee  For proof that he is guilty  I appeal now to himself    for he yet lives  but that he might not escape the hand of justice  I   mingled  in the bowl I give him  the drugs of death        At these words  ALMORAN  striking his hands together  looked upward in   an agony of despair and horror  and fell back upon a sofa that was   behind him  Caled  whose astonishment was equal to his disappointment   and his fears  approached him with a trembling though hasty pace  but as   he stooped to support him  ALMORAN suddenly drew his dagger and stabbed   him to the heart  and repeated the blow with reproaches and execrations    till his strength failed him       In this dreadful moment  the Genius once more appeared before him  at   the sight of whom he waved his hand  but was unable to speak   Nothing     said the Genius   that has happened to ALMORAN  is hidden from me  Thy   peace has been destroyed alike by the defection of Osmyn  and by the   zeal of Caled
