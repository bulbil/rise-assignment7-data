To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Quebec  June 27   I HAVE this moment your letter  my dear  I am happy to hear my mother has been amus d at Bath  and not at all surpriz d to find she rivals you in your conquests  By the way  I am not sure she is not handsomer  notwithstanding you tell me you are handsomer than ever  I am astonish d she will lead a tall daughter about with her thus  to let people into a secret they would never suspect  that she is past five and twenty       You are a foolish girl  Lucy  do you think I have not more pleasure in continuing to my mother  by coming hither  the little indulgencies of life  than I could have had by enjoying them myself  pray reconcile her to my absence  and assure her she will make me happier by jovially enjoying the trifle I have assign d to her use  than by procuring me the wealth of a Nabob  in which she was to have no share       But to return  you really  Lucy  ask me such a million of questions   tis impossible to know which to answer first  the country  the convents  the balls  the ladies  the beaux  tis a history  not a letter  you demand  and it will take me a twelvemonth to satisfy your curiosity       Where shall I begin  certainly with what must first strike a soldier  I have seen then the spot where the amiable hero expir d in the arms of victory  have traced him step by step with equal astonishment and admiration   tis here alone it is possible to form an adequate idea of an enterprize  the difficulties of which must have destroy d hope itself had they been foreseen       The country is a very fine one  you see here not only the beautiful which it has in common with Europe  but the great sublime to an amazing degree  every object here is magnificent  the very people seem almost another species  if we compare them with the French from whom they are descended       On approaching the coast of America  I felt a kind of religious veneration  on seeing rocks which almost touch d the clouds  cover d with tall groves of pines that seemed coeval with the world itself  to which veneration the solemn silence not a little contributed  from Cape Rosieres  up the river St  Lawrence  during a course of more than two hundred miles  there is not the least appearance of a human footstep  no objects meet the eye but mountains  woods  and numerous rivers  which seem to roll their waters in vain       It is impossible to behold a scene like this without lamenting the madness of mankind  who  more merciless than the fierce inhabitants of the howling wilderness  destroy millions of their own species in the wild contention for a little portion of that earth  the far greater part of which remains yet unpossest  and courts the hand of labour for cultivation       The river itself is one of the noblest in the world  it s breadth is ninety miles at it s entrance  gradually  and almost imperceptibly  decreasing  interspers d with islands which give it a variety infinitely pleasing  and navigable near five hundred miles from the sea       Nothing can be more striking than the view of Quebec as you approach  it stands on the summit of a boldly rising hill  at the confluence of two very beautiful rivers  the St  Lawrence and St  Charles  and  as the convents and other public buildings first meet the eye  appears to great advantage from the port  The island of Orleans  the distant view of the cascade of Montmorenci  and the opposite village of Beauport  scattered with a pleasing irregularity along the banks of the river St  Charles  add greatly to the charms of the prospect       I have just had time to observe  that the Canadian ladies have the vivacity of the French  with a superior share of beauty  as to balls and assemblies  we have none at present  it being a kind of interregnum of government  if I chose to give you the political state of the country  I could fill volumes with the pours and the contres  but I am not one of those sagacious observers  who  by staying a week in a place  think themselves qualified to give  not only its natural  but it s moral and political history  besides which  you and I are rather too young to be very profound politicians  We are in expectation of a successor from whom we hope a new golden age  I shall then have better subjects for a letter to a lady       Adieu  my dear girl  say every thing for me to my mother  Yours   ED  RIVERS     LETTER III   3   To Col  RIVERS  at Quebec   London  April 30   INDEED  gone to people the wilds of America  Ned  and multiply the human face divine   tis a project worthy a tall handsome colonel of twenty seven  let me see  five feet  eleven inches  well made
