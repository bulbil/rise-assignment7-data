 He afterwards attempted you  I think  Did he not  O yes  madam  said I    a most sad attempt he made  and I had like to have been lost  for   Mrs  Jewkes was not so good as she should have been  And so I told   her ladyship that sad affair  and how I fell into fits  and that they   believing me dying  forbore   Any attempts after this base one  she   said       He was not so good as he should have been  returned I  once in the   garden  afterwards  but I was so watchful  and so ready to take the   alarm       But  said she  did he not threaten you  at times  and put on his stern   airs  every now and then   Threaten  madam  replied I  yes  I had enough   of that  I thought I should have died for fear several times   How could   you bear that  said she  for he is a most daring and majestic mortal  He   has none of your puny hearts  but is as courageous as a lion  and  boy   and man  never feared any thing  I myself  said she  have a pretty good   spirit  but  when I have made him truly angry  I have always been forced   to make it up with him  as well as I could  for  child  he is not one   that is easily reconciled  I assure you       But  after he had professed honourable love to you  did he never attempt   you again   No  indeed  madam  he did not  But he was a good while   struggling with himself  and with his pride  as he was pleased to call   it  before he could stoop so low  and considered  and considered again    and once  upon my saying but two or three words  that displeased him    when he was very kind to me  he turned me out of doors  in a manner    at an hour s warning  for he sent me above a day s journey towards my   father s  and then sent a man and horse  post haste  to fetch me back   again  and has been exceedingly kind and gracious to me ever since  and   made me happy       That sending you away  said she  one hour  and sending after you the   next  is exactly like my brother  and  tis well if he don t turn you off   twice or thrice before a year comes about  if you vex him  and he would   have done the same by the first lady in the land  if he had been   married to her  Yet has he his virtues  as well as his faults  for he is   generous  nay  he is noble in his spirit  hates little dirty actions  he   delights in doing good  but does not pass over a wilful fault easily  He   is wise  prudent  sober  and magnanimous  and will not tell a lie    nor disguise his faults  but you must not expect to have him all to   yourself  I doubt       But I ll no more harp upon this string  You see how he was exasperated   at me  and he seemed to be angry at you too  though something of it was   art  I believe       Indeed  madam  said I  he has been pleased to give me a most noble   lecture  and I find he was angry with me in earnest  and that it will   not be an easy task to behave unexceptionably to him  for he is very   nice and delicate in his notions  I perceive  but yet  as your ladyship   says  exceeding generous       Well  said she  I m glad thou hadst a little bit of his anger  else I   should have thought it art  and I don t love to be treated with low art    any more than he  and I should have been vexed if he had done it by me       But I understand  child  said she  that you keep a journal of all   matters that pass  and he has several times found means to get at it    Should you care I should see it  It could not be to your disadvantage    for I find it had no small weight with him in your favour  and I should   take great pleasure to read all his stratagems  attempts  contrivances    menaces  and offers to you  on one hand  and all your pretty   counter plottings  which he much praises  your resolute resistance  and   the
