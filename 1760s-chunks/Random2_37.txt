would set about it immediately  —  The player assured him  the process was very simple—that he must cram a hundred weight of dry tinder into a glass retort  and distilling it by the force of animal heat  it would yield half a scruple of insipid water  one drop of which is a full dose —   Upon my integrity   exclaimed the credulous doctor  this is very amazing and extraordinary  that a caput mortuum shall yield any water at all—I must own  I have always been an enemy to specifics  which I thought inconsistent with the nature of the animal oeconomy  but certainly the authority of Solomon is not to be questioned —I wonder where I shall find a glass retort large enough to contain such a vast quantity of tinder  the consumption of which must undoubtedly raise the price of paper—or where shall I find animal heat sufficient  even to warm such a mass  —  Slyboot informed him  that he might have a retort blown for him as big as a church  and that the easiest method of raising the vapour by animal heat  would be to place it in the middle of an infirmary for feverish patients  who might lie upon matrasses around  and in contact with it —He had no sooner pronounced these words  than Wagtail exclaimed in a rapture    An admirable expedient  as I hope to be saved  I will positively put it in practice  —  This simplicity of the physician furnished excellent diversion for the company  who in their turns  sneered at him in ironical compliments  which his vanity swallowed as the genuine sentiments of their hearts —Mr  Chatter    104 impatient of so long a silence  now broke out  and entertained us with a catalogue of all the people who danced at the last Hampstead assembly  with a most circumstantial account of the dress and ornaments of each  from the lappets of the ladies to the shoe buckles of the men  concluding with telling Bragwell  that his mistress Me linda was there and seemed to miss him  and solliciting his company at the next occasion of that kind —   No  no  damme  said Bragwell  I have something else to mind than dangling after a parcel of giddy headed girls —besides  you know my temper is so unruly  that I am apt to involve myself in scrapes  when a woman is concerned —The last time I was there  I had an affair with Tom Trippet  —   O  I remember that  cried Banter  you lugged out before the ladies  and I commend you for so doing  because you had an opportunity of shewing your manhood  without running any risk  —   Risk   said the other with a fierce countenance  d—n my blood  I fear no risks —I a n t afraid of lugging out against any man that wears a head  damme   tis well known I have drawn blood more than once  and lost some too  but what does that signify  —  The player begged this champion to employ him as his second the next time he intended to kill  for he wanted to see a man die of a stab  that he might know how to act such a part the more naturally on the stage —   Die   replied the hero  No  by G—d  I know better things than to incur the verdict of a Middlesex jury—I should look upon my fencing master to be an ignorant son of a b—ch  if he had not taught me to prick any   105 part of my antagonist s body  that I please to disable  —   Oho   cried Slyboot  if that be the case  I have a favour to ask  You must know I am employed to paint a Jesus on the cross  and my purpose is to represent him at that point of time  when the spear is thrust into his side —Now I should be glad you would  in my presence  pink some impertinent fellow into convulsions  without endangering his life  that I may have an opportunity of taking a good clever agony from nature —The doctor will direct you where to enter  and how far to go  but pray let it be as near the left side as possible  —  Wagtail  who took this proposal seriously  observed  that it would be a very difficult matter to penetrate into the left side of the thorax  without hurting the heart  and of consequence killing the patient  but he believed it was possible for a man of a very nice hand  and exact knowledge of anatomy  to wound the diaphragma somewhere about the skirts  which might induce a singultus  without being attended with death —that he was ready to demonstrate the insertion of that muscle to Mr  Bragwell  but desired to have no concern with the experiment  which might essentially prejudice his reputation in case of a miscarriage —Bragwell was as much imposed upon by the painter s waggery as the doctor  and declined engaging in the affair  saying  he had a very great regard for Mr  Slyboot  but had laid it down as a maxim  never to fight except when his honour was engaged —A thousand jokes of this kind were passed  the wine circulated  supper was served in  we eat
