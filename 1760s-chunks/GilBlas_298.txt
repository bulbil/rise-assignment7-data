hamlet  consisting of nine or ten tenements  a house with four small turrets  that is my mansion   The deuce and all  stammered out my secretary  short breathed with sudden admiration  why  that house is one of the prettiest things in nature  Besides the castellated air which those turrets give it  all the beauties of situation and architecture  fertility of soil  and perfection of landscape  combine to rival or excel the immediate neighbourhood of Seville  complimented as it is for its picturesque attractions by the appellation of an earthly paradise  Had we chosen the place of our settlement for ourselves  it could not have been more to my taste  a river meanders through the grounds  distilling plenty and verdure from its fertilizing bosom  the leafy honours of an umbrageous wood invite the mid day walk  and qualify the temperature of the seasons  What a heavenly abode of solitude and contemplation  Ah  my dear master  we shall act very foolishly if we are in a hurry to run away from our happiness  I am delighted  answered I  that you are so well satisfied with the retreat provided for us  though yet acquainted with only a small part of its attractions   As we were chatting in this strain  we got nearer and nearer to the house  where the door opened  as by magic  the moment Scipio announced Signor Gil Blas de Santillane  who was coming to take possession of his estate  At the mention of this name  received with reverential homage by the people who had been instructed in the transfer of their obedience  my carriage was admitted into a large court  where I alighted  then leaning with all my weight upon Scipio  as if walking was a derogation from my dignity  and putting on the great man after the most consequential models  I reached the hall  where  on my entrance  seven or eight servants made their obeisances  They told me they were come to welcome their new master with their best loves and duties  that Don Caesar and Don Alphonso de Leyva had chosen them to farm my establishment  one in quality of cook  another as under cook  a third as scullion  a fourth as porter  and the rest as footmen  with an express injunction to receive no wages or perquisites  as those two noblemen meant to defray all the expenses of my household  The cook  Master Joachim by name  was commander in  chief of this battalion  and announced to me the whole array of the campaign  he declared that he had laid in a large stock of the choicest wines in Spain  and insinuated that for the solid supply of the table  he flattered himself a person of his education and experience  who had been six years at the head of my Lord Archbishop of Valencia s kitchen  must know how to dish up a dinner so as to meet the ideas of the most fastidious layman in Christendom  But the proof of the pudding is in the eating  added he  so I will just go and give you a specimen of my talent  You had better take a walk  my lord  while dinner is getting ready  look about the premises  and see whether you find them in tenantable condition for a person of your lordship s dignity   The reader may guess whether I did not stir my stumps  and Scipio  still more eager than myself to take a bird s eye inventory of our goods and chattels  dragged me back and fore from room to room  There was not a corner of the house that we did not peep into  from the garret to the cellar  not a closet or a cranny  at least as we supposed  could escape our prying curiosity  and in every fresh room we went into  I had occasion to admire the kindness of Don Caesar and his son towards me  I was struck  among other things  with two apartments  which were as elegantly furnished as they could be  without misplaced magnificence  One of them was hung with tapestry  the celebrated manufacture of the Low Countries  the velvet bed and chairs were still very handsome  though in the fashion of the time when the Moors possessed the kingdom of Valencia  The furniture of the other room was in the same taste  to wit  an old suit of hangings  made of yellow Genoa damask  with a bed and arm chairs to match  fringed with blue silk  All these effects  which would have furnished but a sorry display in an upholsterer s shop  made no contemptible appearance in their present situation   After having rummaged over every article of the paraphernalia  my secretary and myself returned to the dining room  where the cloth was laid for two  we sat down  and in an instant they served up so delicious an olla podrida  that we could not help revolving on the various turns of the fate below which had parted the good Archbishop of Valencia from his cook  We had in truth a most catholic and ravenous appetite  a circumstance which added new zest to our praises and enjoyments  Between every succeeding help my servants  with all the alacrity of fresh and holiday service  filled our large glasses to the brim with wine  the choicest vintage of La Mancha  Scipio  not
