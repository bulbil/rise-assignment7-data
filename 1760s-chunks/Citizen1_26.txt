three scenes  the curtain dropped for the first act   Truly  said I to my companion  these kings and queens are very much disturbed at no very great misfortune  certain I am were people of humbler stations to act in this manner  they would be thought divested of common sense  I had scarce finished this observation  when the curtain rose  and the king came on in a violent passion  His wife had  it seems  refused his proffered tenderness  had spurned his royal embrace  and he seemed resolved not to survive her fierce disdain  After he had thus fretted  and the queen had fretted through the second act  the curtain was let down once more   Now  says my companion  you perceive the king to be a man of spirit  he feels at every pore  one of your phlegmatic sons of clay would have given the queen her own way  and let her come to herself by degrees  but the king is for immediate   80 tenderness  or instant death  death and tenderness are leading passions of every modern buskin d heroe  this moment they embrace  and the next stab  mixing daggers and kisses in every period   I was going to second his remarks  when my attention was engrossed by a new object  a man came in balancing a straw upon his nose  and the audience were clapping their hands in all the raptures of applause  To what purpose  cried I  does this unmeaning figure make his appearance  is he a part of the plot  Unmeaning do you call him  replied my friend in black  this is one of the most important characters of the whole play  nothing pleases the people more than the seeing a straw balanced  there is a great deal of meaning in the straw  there is something suited to every apprehension in the sight  and a fellow possessed of talents like these is sure of making his fortune   The third act now began with an actor  who came to inform us that he was the villain of the play  and intended to shew strange things before all was over  He was joined by another  who seem d as much disposed for mischief as he  their intrigues continued through this whole division  If that be a villain  said I  he must be a very stupid one  to tell his secrets without being ask d  such soliloquies of late are never admitted in China   The noise of clapping interrupted me once more  a child of six years old was learning to dance on the stage  which gave the ladies and mandarines infinite satisfaction  I am sorry  said I  to see the pretty creature so early learning so very bad   81 a trade  Dancing being  I presume  as contemptible here as it is in China  Quite the reverse  interrupted my companion  dancing is a very reputable and genteel employment here  men have a greater chance for encouragement from the merit of their heels than their heads  One who jumps up and flourishes his toes three times before he comes to the ground  may have three hundred a year  he who flourishes them four times  gets four hundred  but he who arrives at five is inestimable  and may demand what salary he thinks proper  The female dancers too are valued for this sort of jumping and crossing  and  tis a cant word among them  that she deserves most who shews highest  But the fourth act is begun  let us be attentive   In the fourth act the queen finds her long lost child  now grown up into a youth of smart parts and great qualifications  wherefore she wisely considers that the crown will fit his head better than that of her husband  whom she knows to be a driveler  The king discovers her design  and here comes on the deep distress  he loves the queen  and he loves the kingdom  he resolves therefore  in order to possess both  that her son must die  The queen exclaims at his barbarity  is frantic with rage  and at length overcome with sorrow  falls into a sit  upon which the curtain drops  and the act is concluded   Observe the art of the poet  cries my companion  when the queen can say no more  she falls into a fit  While thus her eyes are shut  while she is supported in the arms of Abigail  what horrors do we not fancy  we feel it in every nerve  take my word for it  that fits are the true aposiopesis of modern tragedy     82The fifth act began  and a busy piece it was  Scenes shifting  trumpets sounding  mobs hallooing  carpets spreading  guards bustling from one door to another  gods  daemons  daggers  racks and ratsbane  But whether the king was killed  or the queen was drowned  or the son was poisoned  I have absolutely forgotten   When the play was over  I could not avoid observing  that the persons of the drama appeared in as much distress in the first act as the last  how is it possible  said I  to sympathize with them through five long acts  pity is but a short lived passion  I hate to hear an actor mouthing trifles
