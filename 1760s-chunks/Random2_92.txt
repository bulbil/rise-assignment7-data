be unmindful of my friends and benefactors —My cousin was ravished with the prospect of my felicity  and willingly contributed towards the expence of fitting me out for my expedition   Accordingly  I took a place in the waggon  and arrived in town  where I hired an apartment in a garret  willing to live as frugally as possible  until I should know what I had to expect from the manager  to whom I intended to offer my play —For though I looked upon myself as perfectly secure of a good reception  imagining that a patentee would be as eager to receive  as I to present my production  I did not know whether or not he might be pre engaged in favour of another author  which would certainly retard my success —On this consideration too  I determined to be speedy in my application  and even to wait upon one of the managers  the very next day  For this purpose  I enquired of my landlord  if he knew where either  or both of them lived  and he being curious to know my business  and at the same time  appearing to be a very honest friendly man  a tallow chandler    278 I made him acquainted with my design  upon which he told me  that I went the wrong way to work  that I would not find such easy access to a manager as I imagined  and that if I delivered my performance without proper recommendation  it would be as one to a thousand if ever it should be minded —   Take my advice  said he  and your business is done —One of the patentees is a good catholick  as I am  and uses the same father who confesses me —I will make you acquainted with this good priest  who is an excellent scholar  and if he shall approve of your play  his recommendation will go a great way in determining Mr  Supple to bring it on the stage  —  I applauded his expedient  and was introduced to the friar  who having perused the tragedy  was pleased to signify his approbation  and commended me in particular  for having avoided all reflections upon religion —He promised to use all his influence with his son Supple  in my behalf  and to inform himself that very day  when it would be proper for me to wait upon him with the piece —He was punctual in performing his engagement  and next morning gave me to understand  that he had mentioned my affair to the manager  and that I had no more to do  than to go to his house any time in the forenoon  and make use of his name  upon which I would find immediate admittance —I took his advice  put my performance in my bosom  and having received directions  went immediately to the house of Mr  Supple  and knocked at the door  that had a wicket in the middle  faced with a net work of iron  through which a servant having viewed me some time  demanded to know my business —I told him  my business   279 was with Mr  Supple  and that I came from Mr  O Varnish —He examined my appearance once more  then went away  returned in a few minutes  and said his master was busy and could not be seen —Although I was a little mortified at my disappointment  I was persuaded that my reception was owing to Mr  Supple s ignorance of my errand  and that I might meet with no more obstructions of the same kind  I desired Mr  O Varnish to be my introductor the next time —He complied with my request  and obtained immediate admittance to the manager  who received me with the utmost civility  and promised to read my play with the first convenience —By his own appointment I called again in a fortnight  but he was gone out  I returned in a week after  and the poor gentleman was extremely ill  I renewed my visit in a fortnight after that  and he assured me  he had been so much fatigued with business  that he had not been able as yet to read it to an end  but he would take the first opportunity  and in the mean time  observed  that what he had yet seen of it was very entertaining —I comforted myself with this declaration a few weeks longer  at the end of which I appeared again before his wicket  was let in  and found him laid up with the gout  I no sooner entered his chamber  than looking at me with a languishing eye  he pronounced    Mr  Melopoyn  I m heartily sorry for an accident that has happened during my illness—you must know  that my eldest boy  finding your manuscript upon the table  in the diningroom  where I used to read it  carried it into the kitchin  and leaving it there  a negligent wench of a cook maid  mistaking it for wastepaper    280 has expended it all but a few leaves in singeing fouls upon the spit—But I hope the misfortune is not irreparable  since  no doubt  you have several copies      I protest to you  my good friend Mr  Random  I was extremely shocked at this information  but the good natured gentleman seemed to be so much affected with my
