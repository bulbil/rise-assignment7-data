But his purposes were far different  he had another scene to act before his mother  Unable to withstand the total overthrow of all his wild projects  he basely yielded to despair  Drawing his sword  he plunged it in his own bosom  His fate resembled that of Oedipus  with this distinction  that the Theban put out his own eyes from remorse for the crime he had perpetrated  while the Castilian  on the contrary  committed suicide from disappointment at the frustration of his purposes   The unhappy Don Valerio was not released from his sufferings immediately  He had leisure left for recollection  and for making his peace with heaven  be fore he rushed into the presence of his Maker  As his death vacated one of the secretaryships on the Duke of Lerma s establishment  that minister  not having forgotten my memoir on the subject of the fire  nor the high character he had heard of me  nominated me to succeed to the post in question       CH  II     Gil Blas is introduced to the Duke of Lerma  who admits him among the number of his secretaries  and requires a specimen of his talents  with which he is well satisfied   MONTESER was the person to inform me of this agreeable circumstance  which he did in the following terms  My friend Gil Blas  though I do not lose you without regret  I am too much your well wisher not to be delighted at your promotion in the room of Don Valerio  You cannot fail to make a princely fortune  provided you act upon two hints which I have to give you  the first  to affect so total a devotion to his excellency s good pleasure  as to leave no room to conceive it possible that you have any other object or interest in life    the second  to pay your court assiduously to Signor Don Rodrigo de Calderona  for that personage models and remodels  fashions and touches upon the mind of his master  just as if it was clay under the hands of the designer  If you are fortunate enough to chime in with that favourite secretary  you will travel post to wealth and honour  and find relays upon the road   Sir  said I to Don Diego  returning him thanks at the same time for his good advice  be pleased to give some little opening to Don Rodrigo s character  I have heard a few anecdotes of him  One would suppose him  from some accounts  not to be the best creature in the world  but the people at large are inveterate caricaturists when they draw courtiers at full length  though  after all  the likeness will strike  in spite of the aggravation  Tell me  therefore  I beseech you  what is your own sincere opinion of Signor Calderona  That is rather an awkward question  answered my principal with an ironical smile  I should tell any one but yourself  without flinching  that he was a gentleman of the strictest honour  upon whose fair fame the breath of calumny had never dared to blow  but I really cannot put off such a copy of my countenance upon you  Relying as I do on your discretion  it becomes a duty to deal candidly in the delineation of Don Rodrigo  for without that  it would be playing fast and loose with you to recommend the cultivation of his good will   You are to know then  that when his excellency was no more than plain Don Francisco de Sandoval  this man had the humility to serve him as his lackey  since which time he has risen by degrees to the post of principal secretary  A prouder excrescence of the dunghill never sprung into vegetation on a summer s day  He considers himself as the Duke of Lerma s colleague  and in point of fact  he may truly be said to parcel out the loaves and fishes of administration  since he gives away offices and governments at the suggestions of his own caprice  The public grumbles and growls upon occasion  but who cares for the grumbling and growling of the public  Let him steal a pair of gloves from the prostitution of political honour  and the bronze upon his forehead will be proof against the peltings of scandal  What I have said will decide your dealings towards so supercilious a compound of dust and ashes  Yes  to be sure  said I  leave me alone for that It will be strange indeed if I cannot wriggle myself into his good graces  If one can but get on the blind side of a man who is to be made a property  it must be want of skill in the player if the game is lost  Exactly so  replied Monteser  and now I will introduce you to the Duke of Lerma   We went at once to the minister  whom we found in his audience  chamber  His levee was more crowded than the king s  There were commanders and knights of St James and of Calatrava  making interest for governments and viceroyalties  bishops who  labouring under oppression of the breath and tightness of the chest in their own dioceses  had been recommended the air of an archbishopric by their physicians  while the sounder lungs of lower dignitaries were strong enough to inhale the Theban atmosphere of a suffragan see
