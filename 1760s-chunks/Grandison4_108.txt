  A combination of sharpers  it seems  had long set him as a man of fortune  But  on his taking refuge with my brother  gave over  for a time  their designs upon him  till he threw himself again in their way   The worthless fellow had been often liberal of his promises of marriage to young creatures of more innocence than this  and thinks it very hard that he should be prosecuted for a crime which he had so frequently committed  with impunity  Can you pity him  I cannot  I assure you  The man who can betray and ruin an innocent woman  who loves him  ought to be abhorred by men  Would he scruple to betray and ruin them  if he were not afraid of the Law —Yet there are women  who can forgive such wretches  and herd with them —  My aunt Eleanor is arrived  A good  plump  bonnyfaced old virgin  She has chosen her apartment  At present we are most prodigiously civil to each other  But already I suspect she likes Lord G  better than I would have her  She will perhaps  if a party should be formed against your poor Charlotte  make one of it     269 Will you think it time thrown away  to read a further account of what is come to hand about the wretches who lately  in the double sense of the word  were overtaken between St  Denis and Paris   Sir Hargrave Pollexfen  it seems  still keeps his chamber  He is thought not to be out of danger from some inward hurt  which often makes him bring up blood in quantities  He is miserably oppressed by lowness of spirits  and when he is a little better in that respect  his impatience makes his friends apprehensive for his head  But has he intellects strong enough to give apprehensions of that nature  Fool and madman we often join as terms of reproach  but I believe  fools seldom run really mad   Merceda is in a still more dangerous way  Besides his bruises  and a fractured skull  he has  it seems  a wound in his thigh  which in the delirium he was thrown into by the fracture  was not duly attended to  and which  but for his valiant struggles against the knife which gave the wound  was designed for a still greater mischief  His recovery is despaired of  and the poor wretch is continually offering up vows of penitence and reformation  if his life may be spared   Bagenhall was the person who had seduced  by promises of marriage  and fled for it  the manufacturer s daughter of Abbeville  He was overtaken by his pursuers at Douay  The incensed father  and friends of the young woman  would not be otherwise pacified than by his performing his promise  which  with infinite reluctance  he complied with  principally thro  the threats of the brother  who is noted for his fierceness and resolution  and who once made the sorry creature feel an Argument which greatly terrified him  Bagenhall is at present at Abbeville  living as well as he can with his new wife  cursing his fate  no doubt  in secret  He is obliged to appear fond of her before her brother and father  the latter being also a four man  a Gascon  always boasting of his family  and   270 valuing himself upon a de  affixed by himself to his name  and jealous of indignity offered to it  The fierce brother is resolved to accompany his sister to England  when Bagenhall goes thither  in order  as he declares  to secure to her good usage  and see her owned and visited by all Bagenhall s friends and relations  And thus much of these fine gentlemen   How different a man is Beauchamp  But it is injuring him  to think of those wretches and him at the same time  He certainly has an eye to Emily  but behaves with great prudence towards her  Yet everybody but she sees his regard for her  Nobody but her guardian runs in her head  and the more  as the really thinks it is a glory to love him  because of his goodness  Every body  she says  has the same admiration of him  that she has   Mrs  Reeves desires me to acquaint you  that Miss Clements having by the death of her mother and aunt  come into a prety fortune  is addressed to by a Yorkshire gentleman of easy circumstances  and is preparing to go down thither to reside  but that she intends to write to you before she goes  and to beg you to favour her with now and then a Letter   I think Miss Clements is a good sort of young woman  But I imagined she would have been one of those Nuns at large  who need not make vows of living and dying Aunt Eleanors  or Lady Gertrudes  all three of them good honest souls  chaste  pious  and plain  It is a charming situation  when a woman is arrived at such a height of perfection  as to be above giving or receiving temptation  Sweet innocents  They have my reverence  if not my love  How would they be affronted  if I were to say pity
