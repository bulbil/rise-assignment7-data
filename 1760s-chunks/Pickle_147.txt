privity and concurrence  Finding  the door unlatched  his suspicion was confirmed  and he made no scruple  of creeping into the chamber on all four  so that the painter  having  stripped himself to the shirt  in groping about for his dulcinea s bed   chanced to lay his hand upon the shaven crown of the father s head   which  by a circular motion  the priest began to turn round in his  grasp  like a ball in a socket  to the surprise and consternation of  poor Pallet  who  neither having penetration to comprehend the case     6 22 15  3 45 PM   nor resolution to withdraw his fingers from this strange object of his  touch  stood sweating in the dark  and venting ejaculations with great  devotion   The friar  tired with this exercise  and the painful posture in which he  stooped  raised himself gradually upon his feet  heaving up at the same  time the hand of the painter  whose terror and amazement increased to  such a degree at this unaccountable elevation  that his faculties began  to fail  and his palm  in the confusion of his fright  sliding over the  priest s forehead  one of his fingers happened to slip into his mouth   and was immediately secured between the Capuchin s teeth with as firm a  fixture as if it had been screwed in a blacksmith s vice   The painter was so much disordered by this sudden snap  which tortured  him to the bone  that  forgetting all other considerations  he roared  aloud   Murder  a fire  a trap  a trap  help  Christians  for the love  of God  help   Our hero  confounded by these exclamation  which he  knew would soon fill the room with spectators  and incensed at his own  mortifying disappointment  was obliged to quit the untasted banquet   and  approaching the cause of his misfortune  just as his tormentor  had thought proper to release his finger  discharged such a hearty  slap between his shoulders  as brought him to the ground with hideous  bellowing  then  retiring unperceived to his own chamber  was one of the  first who returned with a light  on pretence of having been alarmed  with his cries  The Capuchin had taken the same precaution  and followed  Peregrine into the room  pronouncing benedicite  and crossing himself  with many marks of astonishment  The physician and Jolter appearing  at the same time  the unfortunate painter was found lying naked on the  floor  in all the agony of horror and dismay  blowing upon his left  hand  that hung dangling from the elbow  The circumstance of his being  found in that apartment  and the attitude of his affliction  which was  extremely ridiculous  provoked the doctor to a smile  and produced a  small relaxation in the severity of the governor s countenance  while  Pickle  testifying his surprise and concern  lifted him from the ground   and inquired into the cause of his present situation   Having  after some recollection  and fruitless endeavours to speak   recovered the use of his tongue  he told them that the house was  certainly haunted by evil spirits  by which he had been conveyed  he  knew not how  into that apartment  and afflicted with all the tortures  of hell  that one of them had made itself sensible to his feeling  in  the shape of a round ball of smooth flesh  which turned round under his  hand  like an astronomer s globe  and then  rising up to a surprising  height  was converted into a machine that laid hold on his finger  by a  snap  and having pinned him to the spot  he continued for some moments  in unspeakable agony  At last  he said  the engine seemed to melt away  from his finger  and he received a sudden thwack upon his shoulders  as  if discharged by the arm of a giant  which overthrew him in an instant  upon the floor   The priest  hearing this strange account  pulled out of one of his  pouches a piece of consecrated candle  which he lighted immediately  and  muttered certain mysterious conjurations  Jolter  imagining that Pallet  was drunk  shook his head  saying  he believed the spirit was nowhere  but in his own brain  The physician for once condescended to be a wag   and  looking towards one of the beds  observed  that  in his opinion   the painter had been misled by the flesh  and not by the spirit  The    6 22 15  3 45 PM   fair Fleming lay in silent astonishment and affright  and her fellow  in order to acquit herself of all suspicion  exclaimed with incredible  volubility against the author of this uproar  who  she did not doubt   had concealed himself in the apartment with a view of perpetuating some  wicked attempt upon her precious virtue  and was punished and prevented  by the immediate interposition of heaven  At her desire  therefore  and  at the earnest solicitation of the other lady
