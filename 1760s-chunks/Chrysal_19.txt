I resolved to pursue my inquiry  and went to    the shop  as if for some snufE  which  as I expected  was given   me on a piece of the same paper      The rain still giving me a pretence for delaying there  I   â€¢entered into discourse with the woman  and among other idle         xxxiv PREFACE     questions  asked her where she usually got paper to wrap her   wares in  to which she answered         Sometimes from the puhlic offices  and sometimes from   the booksellers and printers   and when she was disappointed   at those places  she was forced to buy brown paper  which   was much dearer   though at present  she made use of some   old stufi that had lain a great while lumbering her garret     having belonged to a lodger of her mother s  who died many   years ago        I then changed the discourse  for fear she should perceive    my design   but presently seeing her going to tear more  for   somebody else that came in  I could not forbear any longer     but offered her brown paper for all the written paper she had    as that was most proper for some work I designed  which she   readily agreed to  and sold me her whole stock for eighteen    pence      This adventure put an end to my walk  so I took the first   coach that went by and hurried home to examine my purchase    which I found to consist of a number of fragments  upon various   subjects  whether originally left unfinished  or torn thus in   the chandler s shop  it was impossible to say   and  among   the rest  the following work  wMch seemed to have undergone   a different  though not much better fate  being blotted in many    places  often paragraphs  and sometimes whole s  being   erased   and  what was worst  this havoc was made in the   most curious and entertaining part of the whole  the philosophy   of the nature and agency of spirits      The oddity of this collection made me resolve to try if I   could learn anything of the author from the woman of the    shop  where I had made my purchase   accordingly I called   upon her one evening  as if merely by accident  and sending    for a pint of wine  to set her tongue a going  I no sooner hinted   my desire  than she directly gave me the following account    which I shall repeat as nearly as possible  in her own   words  shortening it only of expletive exclamations and   repetitions        My father    said she    dying young  and leaving his family   but poorly  my mother took this shop to help her to bring   up three children  of whom I  the eldest  was but five years   old  The times being hard  she was obliged to make every   honest shift  and therefore took in lodgers  and  among the   rest  an elderly man  who rented the garret to sleep in  and a   little turret in the garden  which he fitted up for himself for   a workshop   but what business he followed she never knew    as he let nobody see him at work   nor did she trouble herself   to inquire  as he always paid her punctually   but she imagined         PREFACE XXXV      lie was a smith of some sort  from the quantities of charcoal   he burned  and the constant blowing of his bellows        In this place he spent all his time  often not quitting it for   whole days and nights together  till hunger has forced him to    crawl like a starved rat out of his hole  to get a bit of victuals         At first my mother was uneasy at this  and imagining he   must be out of his mind  or troubled in conscience  she spoke   about him to a worthy gentleman  a clergyman  that lived in   the neighbourhood   but he coming to see him at a time when   he had a clean shirt on  and had eat his victuals  and slept   regularly for some time before  his discourse was so sensible   and pleasant  that the doctor could not help telling him the    cause of his visit as a joke at my mother  to whom he said    when he was going away  that  so far from being mad  he   believed her lodger was the best scholar in
