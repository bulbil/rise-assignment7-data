rattled his bladder with such effect  that Crowe s horse  pricking up his ears  took to his heels  and fled across some ploughed land with such precipitation  that the rider was obliged to quit his spear  and lay fast hold on the mane  that he might not be thrown out of the saddle  Dawdle  who was much better mounted  seeing his condition  rode up to the unfortunate novice  and belaboured his shoulders without fear of retaliation   Mr  Clarke  seeing his kinsman so roughly handled  forgot his fears  and flew to his assistance  but  before he came up  the aggressor had retired  and now perceiving that fortune had declared against his friend and patron  very honourably abandoned him in his distress  and went off at full speed for London   Nor was Timothy Crabshaw without his share in the noble achievements of this propitious day  He had by this time imbibed such a tincture of errantry  that he firmly believed himself and his master equally invincible  and this belief operating upon a perverse disposition  rendered him as quarrelsome in his sphere  as his master was mild and forbearing  As he sat on horseback  in the place assigned to him and Sycamore s lacquey  he managed Gilbert in such a manner  as to invade with his heels the posteriors of the other s horse  and this insult produced some altercation which ended in mutual assault  The footman handled the butt end of his horsewhip with great dexterity about the head of Crabshaw  who declared afterwards  that it sung and simmered like a kettle of cod fish  but the squire  who understood the nature of long lashes  as having been a carter from his infancy  found means to twine his thong about the neck of his antagonist  and pull him off his horse half strangled  at the very instant his master was thrown by Sir Launcelot Greaves   Having thus obtained the victory  he did not much regard the punctilios of chivalry  but  taking it for granted he had a right to make the most of his advantage  resolved to carry off the spolia opima  Alighting with great agility   Brother   cried he   I think as haw yawrs bean t a butcher s horse  a doan t carry calves well—I se make yaw knaw your churning days  I wool—what  yaw look as if yaw was crow trodden  you do —now  you shall pay the score you have been running on my pate  you shall  brother    So saying  he rifled his pockets  stripped him of his hat and coat  and took possession of his master s portmanteau  But he did not long enjoy his plunder  For the lacquey complaining to Sir Launcelot of his having been despoiled  the knight commanded his squire to refund  not without menaces of subjecting him to the severest chastisement for his injustice and rapacity  Timothy represented  with great vehemence  that he had won the spoils in fair battle  at the expense of his head and shoulders  which he immediately uncovered  to prove his allegation  But his remonstrance having no effect upon his master   Wounds   cried he   an I mun gee thee back the pig  I se gee thee back the poke also  I m a drubbing still in thy debt    With these words  he made a most furious attack upon the plaintiff with his horsewhip  and  before the knight could interpose  repaid the lacquey with interest  As an appurtenance to Sycamore and Dawdle  he ran the risk of another assault from the novice Crowe  who was so transported with rage at the disagreeable trick which had been played upon him by his fugitive antagonist  that he could not for some time pronounce an articulate sound  but a few broken interjections  the meaning of which could not be ascertained  Snatching up his pole  he ran towards the place where Mr  Sycamore sat on the grass  supported by the trumpeter  and would have finished what our adventurer had left undone  if the knight of the Crescent  with admirable dexterity  had not warded off the blow which he aimed at the knight of the Griffin  and signified his displeasure in a resolute tone  Then he collared the lacquey  who was just disengaged from the chastising hand of Crabshaw  and swinging his lance with his other hand  encountered the squire s ribs by accident   Timothy was not slow in returning the salutation with the weapon which he still wielded  Mr  Clarke running up to the assistance of his uncle  was opposed by the lacquey  who seemed extremely desirous of seeing the enemy revenge his quarrel  by falling foul of one another  Clarke  thus impeded  commenced hostilities against the footman  while Crowe grappled with Crabshaw  a battle royal ensued  and was maintained with great vigour  and some bloodshed on all sides  until the authority of Sir Launcelot  reinforced by some weighty remonstrances applied to the squire  put an end to the conflict  Crabshaw immediately desisted  and ran roaring to communicate his grievances to Gilbert  who seemed to sympathise very little with his distress  The lacquey took to his heels  Mr  Clarke wiped his bloody nose  declaring he had a good mind to put the aggressor in the
