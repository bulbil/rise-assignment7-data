of Chrysal was   edited by Sir Walter Scott  who compared the work with the   Asmodeus of Lesage  Chrysal  or the Spirit of Gold  is em    bodied in a guinea  which passes through the hands of a   number of eminent or obscure people  and gives an account   of its experiences to an adept in the science of alchemy  whose   unwearied constancy and perseverance have earned at length   the right to receive the   grand secret    the revelation of the   mysteries of nature  Chrysal is a spirit Uke Asmodeus  with   the same supernatural powers of insight   but there the   resemblance ends  for the gold spirit has none of the tricky   sprighthness and malicious wit that make the Spanish imp   so entertaining a character  Johnstone was destitute of   the good  humour and tolerance of Lesage   he had a bitter   and sarcastic nature  and wrote his satire with a gloomy   seriousness that was indeed the usual tone of the satiric muse   in his day  Comparing the two satires  which resemble each   other so exactly in their machinery  Scott rightly distinguishes   between the Horatian spirit of Asmodeus  which is that of   comedy  and the scBva indignatio of Chrysal  which is the   temper of Juvenal  As in Lesage s story  the initial device   makes any further connection between the episodes un    necessary and undesirable  Chrysal passes from hand to   hand  is now at court and now in a pawnbroker s drawer  one   day consorts with admirals and ministers  and the next with   alehouse keepers and thieves  Its peregrinations and strange   vicissitudes of fortune are themselves a source of considerable   entertainment  as were those of the halfpenny and the shilling   in Richard Bathurst and Addison s stories in The Adventurer   and The Taller  from which Johnstone  no doubt  got some   useful ideas  After resting a little while in the purse of General   Wolfe  on the eve of his departure for Quebec  and witnessing   his tender parting with Miss Lowther  afterwards Duchess   of Bolton  the guinea sufiers a series of quick changes  which   may be related in its own words   â€”     My next master was one of the pillars of military glory  who   had contributed a leg  an arm  and the scalp of his head to raise   the trophies of the IVench in America  Though he was destitute   of almost every comfort which nature really stands in need of  his         INTRODUCTION xjii     first care  on the acquisition of such a treasure as I was to him  was   to gratify ths artificial wants of luxury  He went directly to a   gin shop  where he chucked me for a quartern of that liquid fire     the taste of which was too pleasing to his palate  and the warmth   too comfortable to his heart for him to be satisfied with so little    Quartern followed quartern till every sense was intoxicated  and   he feU dead drunk on the floor  when his good natured host had him   kindly laid  to sleep off his debauch  on the next dunghill  first taking   oare to prevent his fellow inhabitants of the streets from robbing   him of the rest of his treasure  by picking his pocket of it himself    The scenes I saw in this service were all of the same kind  but I   was soon relieved from the pain of them  my master giving me as a   present to an ofiBcer of the custom that very night  By this faithful   steward of the public I was next morning given to the factor of   a gang of smugglers  to be laid out for him in lace in Flanders    whither he was just going on the affairs of his profession  With   this industrious trader I went as far as Harwich  where  while they   waited for the tide  he lost me at a game of oribbage to a person   who was going over with him      This person was Aroinadab  the rascally agent of the king s   mistress  the Countess of Yarmouth  and in his company the   coin becomes immersed in the political broils and warlike   ferment of Europe at the outbreak of the Seven Years  War    Chrysal is an eye witness of the execution of Byng   is able   to give a full  true  and particular account of why Minorca   was captured from the French   which officers behaved with   eowardice  and who did their duty  what ministers were re    sponsible for our unpreparedness   and  in a word  to apportion   praise and blame with the fearlessness and decision of a   modern halfpenny paper      The guinea plays the part of special correspondent
