I RECEIVED your Letter last Post  with the Pamphlet wrote against the   Essay on Spirit   I do not think it is well done  nor has he answered the Essay in any Sort to my Satisfaction  He shelters himself entirely under Texts of Scripture  which may be explained and understood as well for the Essay as himself  He does not venture into the Field at large  nor engage at all in the metaphysical Parts of that Work     What does he mean by saying  that   to suppose the one only self existing God can Page  40 delegate a Power of Creation  even to the highest Spirit  is impious and absurb   It does not appear to me that there is any thing  in such a Supposition  beyond the Power  or contrary to the Nature of God     There is something new in his Opinion  that  by the Expression of the Angel of the Lord  is to be understood  not a distinct Spirit  but only the Form or Matter with which the Most High has sometimes indued himself  in order to become visible to the Grossness of human Faculties  This may be true  for any thing that either he or I know  But I think there is no Authority for it in the Scriptures   In speaking of the three Men  who were stiled Jehovah  and appeared to Lot  and from which he means to deduce a Hint of the Trinity in Unity  he gives a very unsatisfactory Reason why only two of them were stiled Angels  And I shall here venture upon a Sentiment of my own on this Head  which has just now occurred to me  Two of the Persons are called Angels  intimating the Father and the Holy Ghost  and the third is only spoken of as Man  prealluding to that State of Humanity  which God the Son was  thereafter  to take upon himself  in this World —I think that this Passage  thus explained  greatly strengthens the Allegory of that Apparition  supposed to manifest to Abraham the Trinity in Unity   Page  41The Insincerity which he charges upon the Author  in the Dedication to the Primate  is  perhaps  true  but he unfairly passes by  that St  Paul was quoted for it  in giving Way  in some Things  to the Customs of the Jews   As to the  Essay on Spirit   my Objection is not to the Treatise  but to the Author  for  as he confesses himself to be a Clergyman  he should have kept himself within the Trammels of his Garb  and    as I said before  rather have governed himself by Form  than guided himself by Reason  The Church Catholicon  indeed  may be a proper Subject for human Disquisition  and has  in former Times  been purged  modelled  and reformed  to the great Advantage of Christianity  But the Church established is a sacred Thing  the Peace of it is not to be disturbed  and Noli irritare is it s Motto  The Author is guilty of the same Officiousness of a Person that should rouze a Friend  dozing away his Life in a Lethargy  who would prefer peaceful Slumbers to the Vigour of Health  or the Length of Days  It had been a more prudent Attempt to have affirmed Atheism  than Unitheism  as Truth and Reason are more safely combated  than Prejudice or Superstition  It is the same Indiscretion  as it would be in a State  for an enthusiastic Patriot to venture his Life or Fortunes for the Sake of Liberty or Page  42 Justice  In short  Truth is no more to be spoken by all Persons  than at all Times   For my Part  I think this Essay  though it has not immediately advanced the Principles of Christian Morality  has had that great End ultimately in View  by strengthening our Faith in the Hierarchy  Metaphysics are  in Truth  a dangerous Science to introduce into Religion  for  where there can be no Certainty  the Doubts must be infinite  Natural Philosophy  with the rational Deductions therefrom  afford  to every contemplative Man  sufficient Light to work his Salvation by  But surely the super metaphysical Doctrine  of Trinity in Unity  has made more Christians recur to Deism  than Divines  perhaps  are aware of  while the Trinity  as explained in this Essay  sufficiently vouched  I think  from the Scriptures  and the Opinions of the antient Fathers of the Church  who immediately followed the Apostles  has nothing anti metaphysical in it  The Possibility of it is comprehensible  and then  and then only  it becomes the proper Object of Faith   But there are some enthusiastic Believers  who are over zealous for Mysteries  and think  that any thing  which falls short of Impossibility  is not sufficient Exercise for the Christian Faith  Perhaps these Men are of that dangerous Sect  who affirmed  that perfect Faith alone was sufficient to Salvation  and that the Doctrine of Page  43 Good Works was impiously presuming to add to the Merits of our Saviour  though the Apostle says    Give all Diligence to add to your Faith Virtue   2 Pet  i 5     For my Part
