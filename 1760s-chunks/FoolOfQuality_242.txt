he returned home to his wife      Well said Hercules and the distaff  cries Harry  But to the   point   the bravest man I know is one Peter Patience  a currier    who lives in the suburbs  My tutor and I were walking one day   through Islington  when we perceived the likelihood of a scuffle at   a distance      As we approached  we saw one man making up with great fury   to another  who would have avoided him   and who  retiring back    ward across the street  parried his blows  and kept him off as well   as he could  His enraged adversary would then have closed in   upon him   but  grasping his shoulder with a long and very strong   arm  he still held his enemy aloof  who nearly spent all his efforts   and blows in the air      Never did I see so living a representation of heaven and hell    as was visible in the faces of those two men  The muscles of the         254 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      one were frightfully distorted  his eyes shot fire  and his mouth   frothed with madness   while the countenance of the other was as a   lake in a summer s evening  that shews heaven in its bosom  and   reflects all the beauties of nature around it      Be quiet  Ben   he said   you know that I would not hurt you     you know that I love you  What a fool the man makes of himself    Are you not sensible that I could demolish you with a single   blow   but I cannot find in my heart to do it  Be quiet  Ben     I say   I see you want to vex me   but I won t be vexed by you    my dear Ben      While the gentle Peter was thus expostulating with his exas    perated friend  Mrs  Patience  as it should seem  had seen all that   passed from an upper casement   and flying down stairs  and rush    ing out at the door  she seized her husband behind by the hair of   his head  and tore and cuffed away at a terrible rate      Poor Peter  finding himself thus between two fires  gave a slight   trip to his male assailant  who instantly fell with his shoulder   against the pavement  and  rising with difficulty  limped homeward    muttering curses all the way      Then Peter  turning meekly to the lady mistress of his house   Gatty  my love  says he  what have I done to provoke you   Oh     she cried  you mean spirited  hare hearted  milk livered poltroon    I ll teach you what it is to suffer every fellow to pommel you     Sirrah  sirrah  and still she cuffed   I ll have you tied down at the   foot of the market cross  with notice on your breast  for all who pass   to spit on you       Then  quite angry to see the man so abused  to whom I had   taken such a fancy  I rushed in between man and wife  and seized   Mrs  Patience by both her hands  but  wrenching one of them   from me  she gave me a round cuff on the side of my head  I   was  however  too well used to cuffs to matter that much  and   so  catching one of her hands on both of mine  I gave her a pluck   to me  and a foot at the same time  and laid her on the broad of   her back in the kennel      My friend Peter looked quite astonished at this  and fearing what   might happen to me on the rising up of his wife  he tucked me like   a gizzard under the wing of a turkey  and off he scoured with me   down the street   while Mr  Clement also made pretty nimbly after   us  for fear  as I suppose  that Mrs  Patience  when on her legs    might take him for one of our company      As soon as we had turned a corner  and were out of harm s way    honest Peter set me down  My friend  says I  if you would be   advised by me  you will not be in a mighty hurry to get back to   your wife  I see a house of entertainment yonder  and I wish   to be further acquainted with you  Adad  said he  you are the   boldest little body that ever I knew   you performed a feat to day   that
