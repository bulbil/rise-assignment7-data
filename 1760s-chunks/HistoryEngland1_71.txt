when they aspired to the character of politeness  The clergy  as a body  little interested themselves in the civil polity  and perhaps were not displeased to see the laity  whom they considered not as fellow subjects  but rivals for power  weakening themselves by continual contests  the laity regarded the clergy with blind veneration  and this veneration lessened their regard for their King  In short  as there was no virtue among the individuals of the nation  the government was like a feverish constitution  ever subject to ferment and disorder  France served  for a while  as a drain to the peccant humours  but  when that was no longer open  the disorder seemed to increase in the internal part of the constitution  and produced all the horrors of civil war   I am   c     208  LETTER XXVII   IT was in this state of the nation that the Earl of Richmond  who took the name of Henry VII  came to the throne  You are now to behold one of the greatest revolutions  that ever was brought about in any kingdom  effected by the prudence  clemency  and perseverance of one great Prince  a nation of tumult reduced to civil subordination  an insolent and factious aristocracy humbled  wise laws enacted  commerce restored  and the peaceful arts rendered amiable to a people  for whom before war only had charms  In a word  you are now to turn to a period  where the whole government seems to put on a new form  and to view the actions of a King  if not the greatest  at least the most useful  that ever sat upon the British  or any other throne  Hitherto you have only read the history of a barbarous nation  obeying with reluctance  and governed by caprice  you are henceforth to view more refined politics  and better concerted schemes  to behold human wisdom  as if rouzed from her lethargy of thirteen hundred years  exerting every art to reduce the natural ferocity of the people  and to introduce happiness   Henry s first care  upon coming to the throne  was to marry the Princess Elizabeth  daughter of Edward IV  and thus unite the interests of the houses of Lancaster and York  but  lest the people should suppose he claimed the crown upon the strength of this alliance  he deferred her coronation 〈◊〉 two years after  by which he made evident the priority of his own claim  His reign happily commenced with an obedience to the laws   209 that had been hitherto unknown in England  An act had been passed  in the preceding reign  for the attainder of his friends and followers  this act still continued in force  and many members of that house  by which it was to be repealed  were those who were mentioned in the attainder  To suffer such to join in repealing that statute would be admitting them judges in their own cause  to which Henry bravely and justly objected  they were  therefore  obliged to leave the house  till an act was passed to reverse their attainder   Before his reign  it was usual  when any person was attainted  to take away his life  and give away his fortune to some court favourite  Henry wisely perceived that this had two bad effects  it first excited resentment  by its cruelty  and  in the next place  only made the favourite too powerful for subjection  This prudent Monarch took a better method to repress tumult and rebellion  he deprived such as were caught in arms of their estates and fortunes  and these he reserved for the use of the crown  By this means he deprived them of the power to injure him  and he strengthened the sinews of government  by enriching the crown  A great part of the miseries of his predecessors proceeded from their poverty  and the opulence of the nobility  Henry saw that money alone could turn the scale of power into his own hands  and therefore hoarded up all the confiscations of his enemies with the utmost frugality  Avarice  upon these motives  is not only excusable  but praise worthy  it is not meanness  but oeconomy  and  whatever historians tell us of liberality in a King  is  at best  misplaced applause  Such liberalities are  in general  extorted from the poor  the industrious  and the useful  and bestowed    210 as rewards  upon the rich and powerful  perhaps upon the sycophants of a court  and flatterers of debauchery  Henry was different from his predecessors in this respect  he gave away few rewards to the courtiers about his person  and none but the poor shared his benefactions  He released all the prisoners for debt in his dominions  whose debts did not amount to forty shillings  and paid their creditors from the royal coffers  His oeconomy rendered him not only useful to the poor  but enabled him to be just to his own creditors  either abroad or at home  Those sums which he borrowed from the city of London  or any of his subjects  he repaid at the appointed day  with the utmost punctuality  and thus  as he grew just in his own dominions  he became respectable abroad   Immediately after his marriage with Elizabeth  he issued
