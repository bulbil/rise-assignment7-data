   Wedn  Nov  1   I Write to the dear child of my tenderest cares  because she requests me to write  Else  I had hastened to her in person  to comfort her doubting heart  and to assure her  that nothing but a fault premeditated  and persisted in  that might have affected her present or future reputation  and consequently her happiness  could make me  for half an hour  offended with her  Your good intentions  my dear child  will ever be your security with me  Men  as well as women  are often misled by their love of surprizes  But the greatest surprize my Emily could give me  would be  if she could do any one thing that would shew a faulty heart   Once more  my dear  pay your duty to your mother in the chariot which has been the causless occasion of so much concern to you  and tell her  and Mr  O Hara  that they have greatly obliged me in declining the acceptance of the chariot  so dutifully presented  till they knew my mind  But that  not so much in the compliment paid to me  as your guardian  as because it has given me an opinion of their own generosity and discretion  Tell them  that I greatly approve of this instance of your duty to your mother  and of your regard  for her sake  to Mr  O Hara  Tell them  that I join with my ever amiable ward in requesting their acceptance of it  and do you    249 my dear  tell Miss Jervois  that I greatly honour her for this new instance of her goodness of heart   I inclose a note  and will  to make you easy  carry it to its proper account  that will enable you to pay the debt which you with so dutiful an intention have contracted —Forgive you  my dear  I love  I admire  you for it  I will not have you stint yourself  as you call it  in order to contribute to the future expence of the chariot  The present is but a handsome one  respecting your fortune  Be therefore  for your mother s life  the whole expence yours  and it may possibly contribute not a little to the ease of mind of both  as they now live together not unhappily  if you have the goodness to assure Mr  O Hara  that you are so well satisfied with his kind treatment of your mother  that you will  on supposition of the continuance of it  before you enter into engagements which may limit your own power  or make your will dependent on that of another person  secure a handsome provision for him  for his life  in case he survive your mother   I thank you  my dearest ward  for the affection you express for my beloved Miss Byron  She loves you so tenderly  that it would have been a concern to me  had she not engaged your love and confidence  You highly oblige me by promising to consult her on all material occasions  The benefit you will receive from her prudent advice and example  and the delight she will receive from your company  will be a happiness to all three  My Emily may depend upon everything to make it completely so  that shall be in the power of  Her faithful Friend  and humble Servant  CHARLES GRANDISON     250  LETTER XXXVIII  Miss JERVOIS  To Sir CHARLES GRANDISON    Thursday  Nov  2   A Few lines  Sir  a very few—Not to shew my vanity  my pride  in being allowed to write to my Guardian  nor to presume to draw him into an intercourse of Letters  No  Sir  I write only to thank you  which I do a thousand thousand times  for the ease  the joy  you have given to my heart  O how I dreaded to open your Letter  But I could not have expected it to be so very indulgent to a faulty girl  Not one rebuke  O Sir  how very good you are  And to send me the money to clear my debts  To bid me make my present  In so gracious a manner to bid me  And to put me upon promising a provision for life for Mr  O Hara  if he survive my mother  which will not oblige them to live a narrower life while they are together  in order to save  in view of such an unhappy event—I flew to them  with the good news—I read the whole Letter to them  O how their hearts blessed you at their eyes  for they could not presently speak  and how my tears mingled with theirs  O Sir  you made us all infants —I  for my part  am still a baby —Did I ever cry so much for grief  as you have made me cry for joy —It is well something now and then comes to check one s joy  there would be no bearing it  else  But I shall encroach on your precious time  Thank you  thank you  Sir  a hundred thousand times  My mother is happy  Mr  O Hara is happy  My Miss Byron will soon be the happiest of all
