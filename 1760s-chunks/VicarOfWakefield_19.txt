 —   That is what I expect    returned she    but I think  my dear  we ought to appear there as decently as possible  for who knows what may happen     Your precautions    replied I    are highly commendable  A decent behaviour and appearance in church is what charms me  We should be devout and humble  chearful and serene    —   Yes    cried she   I know that  but I mean we should go there in as proper a manner as possible  not altogether like the scrubs about us     You are quite right  my dear    returned I    and I was going to make the very same proposal  The proper manner of going is  to go there as early as possible  to have time for meditation before the  Page  95  service begins    —   Phoo  Charles    interrupted she    all that is very true  but not what I would be at  I mean  we should go there genteelly  You know the church is two miles off  and I protest I don t like to see my daughters trudging up to their pew all blowzed and red with walking  and looking for all the world as if they had been winners at a smock race  Now  my dear  my proposal is this  there are our two plow horses  the Colt that has been in our family these nine years  and his companion Blackberry  that have scarce done an earthly thing for this month past  and are both grown fat and lazy  Why should not they do something as well as we  And let me tell you  when Moses has trimmed them a little  they will not be so contemptible      To this proposal I objected  that walking would be twenty times more genteel than such a paltry conveyance  as Blackberry was wall eyed  and the Colt wanted a  Page  96  tail  that they had never been broke to the rein  but had an hundred vicious tricks  and that we had but one saddle and pillion in the whole house  All these objections  however  were over ruled  so that I was obliged to comply  The next morning I perceived them not a little busy in collecting such materials as might be necessary for the expedition  but as I found it would be a business of much time  I walked on to the church before  and they promised speedily to follow  I waited near an hour in the reading desk for their arrival  but not finding them come as expected  I was obliged to begin  and went through the service  not without some uneasiness at finding them absent  This was encreased when all was finished  and no appearance of the family  I therefore walked back by the horse way  which was five miles round  tho  the foot way was but two  and when got about half way home  perceived the procession marching slowly forward towards the church  my son  my wife  and the two  Page  97  little ones exalted upon one horse  and my two daughters upon the other  I demanded the cause of their delay  but I soon found by their looks they had met with a thousand misfortunes on the road  The horses had at first refused to move from the door  till Mr  Burchell was kind enough to beat them forward for about two hundred yards with his cudgel  Next the straps of my wife s pillion broke down  and they were obliged to stop to repair them before they could proceed  After that  one of the horses took it into his head to stand still  and neither blows nor entreaties could prevail with him to proceed  It was just recovering from this dismal situation that I found them  but perceiving every thing safe  I own their present mortification did not much displease me  as it might give me many opportunities of future triumph  and teach my daughters more humility   Page   unnumbered   CHAP  XI   The family still resolve to hold up their heads   MICHAELMAS eve happening on the next day  we were invited to burn nuts and play tricks at neighbour Flamborough s  Our late mortifications had humbled us a little  or it is probable we might have rejected such an invitation with contempt  however  we suffered ourselves to be happy  Our honest neighbour s goose and dumplings were fine  and the lamb s wool  even in the opinion of my wife  who was a connoiseur  was thought excellent  It is true  his manner of telling stories was not quite so well  They were very long  and very dull  and all about himself  and we had laughed at  Page  100  them ten times before  however  we were kind enough to laugh at them once more   Mr  Burchell  who was of the party  was always fond of seeing some innocent amusement going forward  and set the boys and girls to blind man s buff  My wife too was persuaded to join in the diversion  and it gave me pleasure to think she was not yet
