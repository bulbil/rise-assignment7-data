you some notion of matters  with  which your maimer of life   has made you unacquainted  In his fate you see the consequence   of a subaltern s striving to distinguish himself  by doing anjrthing   more than his immediate duty      This  however strange it may appear to you  who judge only from   reason  is strictly consistent with the principles of modem policy    which is calculated entirely for private convenience  without the   least regard to public good  Every attempt of the kind is taken   for an affront by his superiors  as implying a design of enforcing   them to promote him  and putting himself in competition with   them for the good opinion of the public  and therefore discounten    anced  Indeed  if it were otherwise  few men of fortune or interest   would  according to the present way of thinking  go into the army   at all  as they could not expect to enjoy their ease  or show a pru    dent regard to their safety  without being subject to disgraceful   comparisons from the officious assiduity or rashness of every man   desperate in disposition or circumstances  who disregarded life and   all its pleasures  or had no way of being able to live  but hazarding   the loss of them      In former times  men entered into the profession of arms with a   certain prospect of honour and advantage  if they could merit   them  and therefore exerted all their abilities of mind and body in   emulation for so tempting a prize   but now  every idler who is   unfit for any other business  purchases a commission  in order to   live upon the pay  and as he is sensible that no efforts of his own   can procure an addition to that pay  by raising him to a higher   rank  he is satisfied to enjoy his bargain as easily as he can  and do   no more than he needs must to avoid losing it  And this will ac    count to you for the difference between the English forces now and   in those days  Nor is the case otherwise with those who get into   the army by interest  They depend solely upon the same interest   to push them forward  and therefore give themselves no trouble to   deserve promotion  which they are convinced no desert could pro    cure them  But  to quit reflections not likely to be regarded  and   return to my story  You must not expect a minute detail of the   progress of this enterprise  The operations of war are too confused   to give pleasure to reason in the representation  too horrid not to   give pain to humanity      I see you think this too severe  but such thoughts are the effect   of prejudice  When the victories which have been blazoned highest    and which reflected the greatest honour on those who gained them    are stripped of the false colouring laid on only to dazzle and deceive          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 307     and examined coolly  most of them will be found owing to some un    foreseen accidentâ€”  some lucky improvement of a blunder of the   enemy  or else an obstinate perseverance in their own  after every   boasted rule of art had been broke through  every resource of judg    ment exhausted in vain  and to have been attended by circumstances   of such misery and loss to victors as well as vanquished  as tarnished   all their glory  and infinitely overbalanced eveiy advantage possible   to be gained by them  I shall therefore mention only such particu    lars as may contribute to illustrate this picture of the heart of man    The ardour shown by the subaltern officers and private men in   carrying on the siege  in which they suffered more from the inclem    encies of a climate unnatural to them  and against which no proper   provision had been made  though they had been delayed to meet   its fiercest fury  as well as from the diseases caused by the badness   of every necessary of life  than from all the efforts of the enemy    all the arts which the ingenuity of man has devised for the destruc    tion of his own unhappy species  was impossible to be accounted for   from any other principles than disregard to a life destitute of every   comfort and convenience that could endear it â€” a remark which     to  the humane wisdom of some  may seem to justify the deficiency   and badness of every kind of provision  too generally made for them   on such occasions  while those whose higher rank may be thought   to animate them with a sense of honour and ambitious hope  and   who therefore may be thought not to want such incitements to   desperation  enjoy a luxury scarce to
