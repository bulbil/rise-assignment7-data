la bonne foi ne sert qu a être dupe    Letter to the Marquis de Gallo  July 2  1800   In the case of Gil Blas  the habit of reflection has engendered a conscience  As he grows older in experience  the practical promptings of that conscience tend to arrest many an impulse to indulge his petty vices and to reinforce the virtues which he is prudent enough to regard as useful  His efforts to better his lot  while they bring to the fore his harmless vanity  and often indeed a certain less agreeable snobbishness  are after all to his credit  He is the first to laugh at his own mistakes  as he is the first to learn the lesson of his blunders  Here is a characteristic utterance of his    I let myself go with the current for three weeks  I gave myself up to every form of voluptuous pleasure  But I will say at the same time that in the midst of it all a sense of remorse often mingled bitterness with my delight  Debauch did not stifle this remorse  my remorse increased  on the contrary  in proportion as I became more and more of a debauchee  and  as a result of my fortunately honest nature  the disorder of the theatrical life began to strike me with horror  Ah  wretch that you are  I said to myself  is it thus that you are fulfilling the expectations of your family  Is it impossible  merely because you are a servant  to be an honest man  Do you really find it worth while to live with such a vicious crew  Envy  anger and avarice dominate some of them  modesty is unknown to others  Some have given themselves up to intemperance and idleness  while in others pride has become insolence  Enough of this  I will dwell no longer with the seven deadly sins    From all that we know of Lesage himself  as well as from a comparison of Gil Blas with the author s other Works  it seems legitimate to conclude that the good humour of his most famous hero is merely the expression of his own philosophic gaiety  at all events of his own disabused placidity  his bourgeois moderation and practical sense  his bias toward taking things easily  Life  when viewed at the angle adopted by Lesage  is an endless series of comic situations of a highly diverting and edifying character  Many of its conventions  which are nurtured on hypocrisy and snobbery  form a constant object of his good  humoured raillery  just as they form the subject matter of the comic verve of his great master  Molière  Both have the most refreshing sense of values and an unimpeachable intellectual honesty  The most comic incidents of the tale are the series of rebuffs experienced by Lesage s naive hero before he finally reaches the point where discretion becomes second nature  With what touching and respectful candour does Gil Blas fall a prey to the pretensions and foibles of the great  Note the art with which Lesage  juxtaposing his hero with  for instance  an Archbishop of Granada  shows the vain prelate so enamoured of his own productions as to suffer no honest criticism from even the most disinterested of his acolytes  First cajoled by flattery  then infuriated by the naive frankness of Gil Blas  whose opinion he had solicited  he shows the rash youth the door  and Gil Blas returns once again to his life of adventure  It is his rich fund of good sense that saves him here as throughout his career  and that keeps his judgment sane and his heart true amid all the eccentricities and affectations and passing passions  and even the temptations  which surround and beset him during his checkered years  This jolly easy going boon companion is a long time learning to be canny  but he is never really a fool  He comes out ultimately the poorer for the loss of a good many illusions  but profoundly convinced that straightforwardness in human relations is as desirable a good as simplicity in art   Watch him with his friend Fabrice  turned writer à la mode  after having been the astute lackey who early in life defined with such cold blooded cynicism the ideals of a servant    le métier de laquais est impossible  je l avoue  pour un imbecile  mais il a des charmes pour un garçon d esprit  Un génie supérieur qui se met en condition ne fait pas son service matériellement comme un nigaud  Il entre dans une maison pour commander plutôt que pour servir  Il commence par étudier son maître  il se prête à ses défauts  gagne sa confiance et le mène ensuite par le nez    Fabrice  seized by  la rage d écrire   as Gil Blas calls it  and convinced that he has in him the stuff of a great writer  ignores the sage advice of his employer who has warned him that poetry is not all beer and skittles  and comes up to Madrid  the centre of  les beaux esprits    in order to form his taste   He falls under the influence of one of the leaders in a log rolling literary set  and so adroitly imitates the fashion of the hour that he is regarded as one of the cleverest writers of the younger generation  He and Gil Blas meet  after many years
