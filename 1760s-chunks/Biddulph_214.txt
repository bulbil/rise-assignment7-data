him as soon as they came in sight of him  and followed him at a proper distance  still keeping him in view  ’till he lighted at the post house  They then at once entered the room  into which he had retired  whilst fresh horses were getting ready   Mr Faulkland started at the sight of my brother  he looked earnestly at Mr Warner  whom he had never seen before  but spoke not to either of them   Sir George  pursued my kinsman  accosted him affectionately  Dear Faulkland  was this kind of you  thus to fly from your friends that love you  He presented me to him at the same  naming me as his relation   Mr Faulkland grasped the hand  which I reached out in salutation to him  he fixed his fine sparkling eyes on my face  Is it Mr Warner whom I have the honour to salute  Sir  I am no stranger to your worth  I honour  I revere you  You are too good to interest yourself thus for an unhappy wretch  cast off  and forsaken by all the world   Do I forsake you  Faulkland  cried your brother  kindly enough  No  Faulkland  I am your constant sincere friend  and will prove myself so  if you will but let me  Mr Faulkland made no reply   Dear Faulkland  am I not your friend  You are Mrs Arnold’s brother —You are not the man you were  Indeed Faulkland  I am  I am your true friend  suffer me to be so  come back with me  Mr Warner and I have followed you  in the hope of prevailing on you to    return with us  do  Faulkland  let us persuade you to preserve a life so dear to us all   What am I to live for  answered Mr Faulkland sternly  You have tried to deceive me  the man I loved most  now I am fallen  rejects me  Your sister persists in her obstinate cruelty towards me  she breaks her promise  and you encourage her in it  I have neither friends  fortune  or country  and do you talk to me of life on such conditions  No  Bidulph  it is a burden of which I will rid myself—Mr Warner  you are a generous man  you have an enlarged mind  may a stranger ask a favour of you   I could have wept  continued my kinsman  to see such a frank noble fellow driven to such desperation  Command me  Sir  I replied  there is nothing I would not do to serve you   I thank you  Sir  I have a little son  let me recommend the unhappy orphan to your protection  He will soon want a father  will you be one to him  Sir  I will send him over to you  he laid hold of my hand  and repeated his question  Will you Mr Warner  You have an enlarged mind  and do not despise the unfortunate   I cried downright  he touched me to the very quick  I never was so affected in my life  and I own I was heartily displeased both with you and your brother  for driving him to such extremities  You especially  on whom I laid injunctions to act in a contrary way  As for Sir George  I am not surprized at his behaviour   From Mr Faulkland’s discourse  proceeded my kinsman  it was apparent to me  that his distraction proceeded from no other cause  than his belief that you and your brother slighted him in his misfortunes  It was plain when he fled to England  that he was sufficiently in his senses to be anxious for his own safety  and though the sight of you  joined to the hurry of his spirits  his fatigue  and want of sleep  might  in a man of such violent passions  have created a temporary phrenzy  yet I am very certain it would all have subsided  if you had behaved to him as you ought to have done  and as I desired you would  nor do I see how you can answer it to yourself  after the miseries you have already brought on such a glorious man  for I never saw his equal either in mind or person  to persist in a behaviour which has already turned his brain  and must in the end occasion his death  for death he is determined on  if you refuse to become his wife   Oh  Sir  cried I  leave him not to himself  I conjure you  you see the influence you have over his mind  you have done wonders in    bringing him back — Hold  replied Mr Warner  till I inform you of the means I was obliged to use   I have told you how I was affected with his situation  and the request he made me to take care of his child  This was not the suggestion of madness  it was plain to me  that if the cause were removed  he would soon be restored to the perfect use of his reason  and I could not bear to see the desolation of such a noble frame  and all charged to your account   Sir  I hope you
