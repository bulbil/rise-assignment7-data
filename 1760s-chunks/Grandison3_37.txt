to make the tender  For free minds  he said  loved not to be ungenerously dealt with     90 What a man is this  Lucy   No wonder  thus gloriously employed  with my Lord W  and the Danby s  said Lord L  and perhaps in other acts of goodness that we know nothing of  besides the duties of his executorship  that we are deprived of his company  But some of these  as he has so good a friend as Dr  Bartlett  he might transfer to him—and oblige us more with his presence  and the rather  as he declares it would be obliging himself   Ah  my Lord  said the doctor  and looked round him  his eyes dwelling longest on me—You don t know—He stopped  We all were silent  He proceeded—Sir Charles Grandison does nothing without reason  A good man must have difficulties to encounter with  that a meer man of the world would not be embarrassed by —But how I engage your attention  Ladies —  The doctor arose  for breakfast was over—Dear doctor  said Miss Grandison  don t leave us—As to that Bologna  that Camilla  that Bishop—Tell us more of them  dear doctor   Excuse me  Ladies  excuse me  my Lord  He bowed  and withdrew   How we looked at one another  How the fool  in particular  blushed  How her heart throbbed —At what —  But  Lucy  give me your opinion—Dr  Bartlett guesses  that I am far from being indifferent to Sir Charles Grandison  He must be assured  that my own heart must be absolutely void of benevolence  if I did not more and more esteem Sir Charles  for his  And would Dr  Bartlett be so cruel  as to contribute to a flame  that  perhaps  is with difficulty kept from blazing out  as one hears new instances of his generous goodness  if he knew that Sir Charles Grandison was so engaged  as to render it impossible—What shall I say —O this cruel  cruel suspense—What hopes  what fears  what contradictory conjectures    91 —But all will too soon perhaps—Here he is come—Sir Charles Grandison is come—  O no —A false alarm —He is not come  It is only my Lord L  returned from an airing   I could beat this girl  this Emily —It was owing to her —A chit —How we have fluttered each other —But send for me down to Northamptonshire  my dear friends  before I am quite a fool   PRAY—Do you know  Lucy  What is the business that calls Mr  Deane to town  at this season of the year  He has made a visit to Sir Charles Grandison  For Dr  Bartlett told me  as a grateful compliment  that Sir Charles was much pleased with him  yet Mr  Deane did not tell me  that he designed it  I beseech you  my dear friends—Do not—But you would not  you could not —I would be torn in pieces  I would not accept of—I don t know what I would say  Only add not disgrace to distress —But I am safe  if nothing be done but at the motion of my grandmamma and aunt Selby  They would not permit Mr  Deane  or any body  to make improper visits —But don t you think  that it must look particular to Sir Charles  to have a visit paid him by a man expressing for me so much undeserved tenderness and affection  so long after the affair was over which afforded him a motive for it —I dread  as much for Mr  Dean s sake as my own  every thing that may be construed into officiousness or particularity  by so nice a discerner  Does he not say  that no man is more quick sighted than himself  to those saults in women which are owing to want of delicacy   I have been very earnest with Lord and Lady L  and Miss Grandison  that they do not suffer their friendship for me to lay me under any difficulties with their brother  They all took my meaning  and promised to consult my punctilio  as well as my inclination  Miss Grandison was more kindly in earnest    92 in her assurances of this nature  than I was afraid she would be  And my Lord said  It was fit that I should find even niceness gratified  in this particular    I absolutely confide in you  Lucy  to place hooks where I forget to put them  and where  in your delicate mind  you think I ought to put them  that they may direct your eye  when you come to read out before my uncle  to omit those passages which very few men have delicacy or seriousness enough to be trusted with  Yet  a mighty piece of sagacity  to find out a girl of little more than Twenty  in Love  as it is called  and to make a jest of her for it  — But I am peevish  as well as saucy —This also goes between hooks    Adieu  my Dear   LETTER XIII  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  To Dr  BARTLETT   Monday Night  Mar  20   I AM very much dissatisfied with myself  my dear Dr  Bartlett
