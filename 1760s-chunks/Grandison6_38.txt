particulars of what passed between my brother and him  pray do  We long also to see the Letter he has put into your hands  from Bologna  It is on the road  we hope   Caroline and I are as much concerned for your honour  your punctilio  as you  or any of you  can be  But by the account you give me of my brother s address to you in presence of your grandmother and aunt  as well as from our knowledge of his politeness  neither you nor we need to trouble our heads about it  It may be all left to him  He knows so well what becomes the character of the woman whom he hopes to call his wife  that you will be sure of your dignity being preserved  if you place a confidence in him  And yet no man is so much above mere formal regards as he is  Let me enumerate instances  from your Letter before me     95 His own intention  in the first place  not to surprise you by his visits  as you apprehended he would  which would have made him look like a man of selfimagined consequence to you—His providing himself with accommodations at an inn  and not giving way to the invitation  even of your sagacious uncle Selby  I must raily him  Does he spare me  —His singling you out on Friday from your men friends  yet giving you the opportunity of your aunt s and grandmother s company  to make his personal application to you for your favour—His requesting the interest of your other friends with you  as if he presumed not on your former acquaintance  and this after an application  not discouraged  made to your friends and you   As to his equanimity in his first address to you  his retaining your hand  forsooth  before all your friends  and so forth  never find fault with that  Hariet   Indeed you do make an excuse for the very freedom you blame—So Lover like —  He is the very man  that a conscious young woman  as you are  should wish to be addressed by  So much courage  yet so much true modesty—What  I warrant  you would have had a man chalked out for you▪ who should have stood at distance  bowed  scraped  trembled  while you had nothing to do  but bridle  and make stiff courtesies to him  with your hands before you—Plagued with his doubts  and with your can dissidences  afraid he would now  and now  and now  pop out the question  which he had not the courage to put  and so running on  simpering  fretting  fearing  two parrallel lines  side by side  and never meeting  till some interposing friends  in pity to you both  put one s head pointing to the other s head  and stroking and clapping the shoulder of each  set you at each other  as men do by other dunghil bred creatures   You own  he took no notice of your emotion  when he first addressed himself to you  so gave you   96 an opportunity to look up  which otherwise you would have wanted  Now don t you think you know a man creature or two  who would on such an occasion  have grinned you quite out of countenance  and insulted you with their pity for being modest —But you own  that he had emotion too  when he first opened his mind to you—What a duce would the girl have —Orme and Fowler in your head  no doubt  The tremblings of rejected men  and the phantasies of romantic women  were to be a rule to my brother  I suppose with your mock majesty —Ah  Harriet  Did I not say that we women are very silly creatures —But my brother is a good man—So we must have something to find fault with him for —Hah  hah  hah  hah  What do you laugh at  Charlotte —What do I laugh at  Harriet —Why  at the idea of a couple of Loveyers  taken each with a violent ague fit  at their first approach to each other—Hands shaking—Knees trembling—Lips quivering—Tongue faultering—Teeth chattering—I had a good mind to present you with an ague dialogue between such a trembling couple —I  I  I  I  says the Lover—You  you  you  you  says the girl  if able to speak at all  But  Harriet  you shall have the whole  on demand  Rave at me  if you will  But Love  as it is called by boys and girls  shall ever be the subject of my ridicule  Does it not lead us girls into all manner of absurdities  inconveniencies  undutifulness  disgrace —Villainous Cupidity —It does   To be serious—Neither does my brother address you in a stile that impeaches either his own understanding  or yours —Another fault  Harriet  is it not —But sure you are not so very a girl   The justice he does to Lady Clementina and her family  Let me be very serious  when I speak of Clementina  is a glorious instance as well of his greatness of mind  as of his sincerity  He has no need to depreciate one Lady  to help him to exalt  or do justice    97 I should rather say
