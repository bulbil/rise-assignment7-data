     THE ADVENTURES OF Roderick Random   Et genus   virtus  nisi cum re  vilior alga est   HOR   In TWO VOLUMES   VOL  I   LONDON  Printed for J  OSBORN in Pater noster Row  MDCCXLVIII     iii  THE PREFACE   OF all kinds of satire  there is none so entertaining  and universally improving  as that which is introduced  as it were  occasionally  in the course of an interesting story  which brings every incident home to life  and by representing familiar scenes in an uncommon and amusing point of view  invests them with all the graces of novelty  while nature is appealed to in every particular     iv The reader gratifies his curiosity  in pursuing the adventures of a person in whose favour he is prepossessed  he espouses his cause  he sympathizes with him in distress  his indignation is heated against the authors of his calamity  the humane passions are inflamed  the contrast between dejected virtue  and insulting vice  appears with greater aggravation  and every impression having a double force on the imagination  the memory retains the circumstance  and the heart improves by the example  The attention is not tired with a bare Catalogue of characters  but agreeably diverted with all the variety of invention  and the vicissitudes of life appear in their peculiar circumstances  opening an ample field for wit and humour   Romance  no doubt  owes its origin to ignorance  vanity and superstition  In the dark ages of the world  when a man had rendered himself famous for wisdom or valour    v his family and adherents availed themselves of his superior qualities  magnified his virtues  and represented his character and person as sacred and supernatural  The vulgar easily swallowed the bait  implored his protection  and yielded the tribute of homage and praise even to adoration  his exploits were handed down to posterity with a thousand exaggerations  they were repeated as incitements to virtue  divine honours were paid  and altars erected to his memory  for the encouragement of those who attempted to imitate his example  and hence arose the heathen mythology  which is no other than a collection of extravagant Romances —As learning advanced  and genius received cultivation  these stories were embellished with the graces of poetry  that they might the better recommend themselves to the attention  they were sung in publick  at festivals  for the instruction and delight of the audience  and rehearsed before battle  as incentives to deeds of glory  Thus tragedy and the   vi epic muse were born  and  in the progress of taste  arrived at perfection —It is no wonder  that the ancients could not relish a fable in prose  after they had seen so many remarkable events celebrated in verse  by their best poets  we therefore  find no romance among them  during the aera of their excellence  unless the Cyropaedia of Zenophon may be so called  and it was not till arts and sciences began to revive  after the irruption of the Barbarians into Europe  that any thing of this kind appeared  But when the minds of men were debauched by the imposition of priest craft to the most absurd pitch of credulity  the authors of romance arose  and losing sight of probability  filled their performances with the most monstrous hyperboles  If they could not equal the ancient poets in point of genius  they were resolved to excel them in fiction  and apply to the wonder rather than the judgment of their readers  Accordingly they brought negromancy to their aid  and instead of supporting the character   vii of their heroes  by dignity of sentiment and practice  distinguished them by their bodily strength  activity and extravagance of behaviour  Although nothing could be more ludicrous and unnatural than the figures they drew  they did not want patrons and admirers  and the world actually began to be infected with the spirit of knight errantry  when Cervantes  by an inimitable piece of ridicule  reformed the taste of mankind  representing chivalry in the right point of view  and converting romance to purposes far more useful and entertaining  by making it assume the sock  and point out the follies of ordinary life   The same method has been practised by other Spanish and French authors  and by none more successfully than by Monsieur Le Sage  who in his adventures of Gil Blas  has described the knavery and foibles of life  with infinite humour and sagacity —The following sheets I have modelled on his plan  taking the liberty  however  to   viii differ from him in the execution  where I thought his particular situations were uncommon  extravagant  or peculiar to the country in which the scene is laid —The disgraces of Gil Blas  are for the most part  such as rather excite mirth than compassion  he himself laughs at them  and his transitions from distress to happiness  or at least ease  are so sudden  that neither the reader has time to pity him  nor himself to be acquainted with affliction —This conduct  in my opinion  not only deviates from probability  but prevents that generous indignation  which ought to animate the reader  against the sordid and vicious disposition of the world   I have attempted to represent modest merit struggling with every difficulty
