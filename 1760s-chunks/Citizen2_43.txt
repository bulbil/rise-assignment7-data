what sort of a people am I got amongst  where being out of black is a certain symptom of poverty  where those who have miserable faces cannot have mourning  and those who have mourning will not wear a miserable face   LETTER XCIV  From the same   IT is usual for the booksellers here  when a book has given universal pleasure upon one subject  to bring out several more upon the same plan  which are sure to have purchasers and readers from that desire which all men have to view a pleasing object on every side  The first performance serves rather to awake than satisfy attention  and when that is once moved  the slightest effort serves to continue its progression  the merit of the first diffuses   131 a light sufficient to illuminate the succeeding efforts  and no other subject can be relished  till that is exhausted  A stupid work coming thus immediately in the train of an applauded performance  weans the mind from the object of its pleasure  and resembles the sponge thrust into the month of a discharged culverin  in order to adapt it for a new explosion   This manner  however  of drawing off a subject  or a peculiar mode of writing to the dregs  effectually precludes a revival of that subject or manner for some time for the future  the sated reader turns from it with a kind of literary nausea  and though the titles of books are the part of them most read  yet he has scarce perseverance enough to wade through the title    Of this number I own myself one  I am now grown callous to several subjects  and different kinds of composition  whether such originally pleased I will not lake upon me to determine  but at present I spurn a new book merely upon seeing its name in an advertisement  nor have the smallest curiosity to look beyond the first leaf  even though in the second the author promises his own face neatly engraved on copper   I am become a perfect Epicure in reading  plain beef or solid mutton will never do  I am for a Chinese dish of bear s claws and bird s nests  I am for sauce strong with assafoetida  or fuming with garlic  For this reason there are an hundred very wise  learned  virtuous  well intended productions that have no charms for me  Thus  for the soul of me  I could never find courage nor   132 grace enough to wade above two s deep into Thoughts upon God and Nature  or Thoughts upon Providence  or Thoughts upon Free Grace  or indeed into Thoughts upon any thing at all  I can no longer meditate with Meditations for every day in the year  Essays upon divers subjects cannot allure me  though never so interesting  and as for Funeral Sermons  or even Thanksgiving Sermons  I can neither weep with the one  nor rejoice with the other   But it is chiefly in gentle poetry  where I seldom look farther than the title  The truth is  I take up books to be told something new  but here  as it is now managed  the reader is told nothing  He opens the book  and there finds very good words  truly  and much exactness of rhyme  but no information  A parcel of gaudy images pass on before his imagination like the figures in a dream  but curiosity  induction  reason  and the whole train of affections are fast asleep  The jocunda et idonea vitae  those sallies which mend the heart while they amuse the fancy  are quite forgotten  so that a reader who would take up some modern applauded performances of this kind  must  in order to be pleased  first leave his good sense behind him  take for his recompence and guide bloated and compound epithet  and dwell on paintings  just indeed  because laboured with minute exactness   If we examine  however  our internal sensations  we shall find ourselves but little pleased with such laboured vanities  we shall find that our applause rather proceeds from a kind of contagion caught up from others  and which we contribute to diffuse  than from what we privately feel  There are   133 some subjects of which almost all the world perceive the futility  yet all combine in imposing upon each other  as worthy of praise  But chiefly this imposition obtains in literature  where men publicly contemn what they relish with rapture in private  and approve abroad what has given them disgust at home  The truth is  we deliver those criticisms in public which are supposed to be best calculated not to do justice to the author  but to impress others with an opinion of our superior discernment   But let works of this kind  which have already come off with such applause  enjoy it all  It is neither my wish to diminish  as I was never considerable enough to add to their fame  But for the future I fear there are many poems  of which I shall find spirits to read but the title  In the first place  all odes upon winter  or summer  or autumn  in short all odes  epodes  and monodies whatsoever  shall hereafter be deemed too polite  classical  obscure  and refined  to be read  and entirely above human comprehension  Pastorals are pretty
