      I am hurt  because I began really to like the creature  a secret however to which he is happily a stranger  I shall see him to morrow at the governor s  and suppose he will be in his penitentials  I have some doubt whether I shall let him dance with me  yet it would look so particular to refuse him  that I believe I shall do him the honor       Adieu   Your affectionate  A  FERMOR   26th  Thursday  11 at night       No  Lucy  if I forgive him this  I have lost all the free spirit of woman  he had the insolence to dance with Madame La Brosse to night at the governor s  I never will forgive him  There are men perhaps quite his equals  but  tis no matter I do him too much honor to be piqued yet on the footing we were I could not have believed       Adieu       I was so certain he would have danced with me  that I refused Colonel H—  one of the most agreable men in the place  and therefore could not dance at all  Nothing hurt me so much as the impertinent looks of the women  I could cry for vexation       Would your brother have behaved thus to Emily  but why do I name other men with your brother  do you know he and Emily had the good nature to refuse to dance  that my sitting still might be the less taken notice of  We all played at cards  and Rivers contrived to be of my party  by which he would have won Emily s heart if he had not had it before       Good night     LETTER CII   102   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   Quebec  March 2   I HAVE been twice at Silleri with the intention of declaring my passion  and explaining my situation  to Emily  but have been prevented by company  which made it impossible for me to find the opportunity I wished       Had I found that opportunity  I am not sure I should have made use of it  a degree of timidity is inseparable from true tenderness  and I am afraid of declaring myself a lover  lest  if not beloved  I should lose the happiness I at present possess in visiting her as her friend  I cannot give up the dear delight I find in seeing her  in hearing her voice  in tracing and admiring every sentiment of that lovely unaffected generous mind as it rises       In short  my Lucy  I cannot live without her esteem and friendship  and though her eyes  her attention to me  her whole manner  encourage me in the hope of being beloved  yet the possibility of my being mistaken makes me dread an explanation by which I hazard losing the lively pleasure I find in her friendship       This timidity however must be conquered   tis pardonable to feel it  but not to give way to it  I have ordered my carriole  and am determined to make my attack this very morning like a man of courage and a soldier       Adieu    Your affectionate  ED  RIVERS       A letter from Bell Fermor  to whom I wrote this morning on the subject      To Colonel RIVERS  at Quebec   Silleri  Friday morning        You are a foolish creature  and know nothing of women  Dine at Silleri  and we will air after dinner   tis a glorious day  and if you are timid in a covered carriole  I give you up        Adieu    Yours    A  FERMOR        LETTER CIII   103   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   Quebec  March 27  11 at night   SHE is an angel  my dear Lucy  and no words can do her justice  I am the happiest of mankind  I painted my passion with all the moving eloquence of undissembled love  she heard me with the most flattering attention  she said little  but her looks  her air  her tone of voice  her blushes  her very silence how could I ever doubt her tenderness  have not those lovely eyes a thousand times betrayed the dear secret of her heart       My Lucy  we were formed for each other  our souls are of intelligence  every thought  every idea from the first moment I beheld her I have a thousand things to say  but the tumult of my joy she has given me leave to write to her  what has she not said in that permission       I cannot go to bed  I will go and walk an hour on the battery   tis the loveliest night I ever beheld  even in Canada  the day is scarce brighter   One in the morning       I have had the sweetest walk imaginable  the moon shines with a splendor I never saw before  a thousand streaming meteors add to her brightness  I have stood gazing on the lovely planet  and delighting myself with the idea that  tis the same moon that lights my Emily       Good
