signal to be made for her  and give you a draft   upon my agent            ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 341       Good Heaven     exclaimed my master    can there be such   virtue in man          Come   what is the sum     interrupted the captain  who wanted   to shorten a conversation that began to be too affecting to him      I shall think you doubt my sincerity if you hesitate to accept my   friendship          Such a doubt    returned my master  whose heart a gush of tears   had lightened    would be a blacker crime than ever stained my soul    No   I receive your beneficemoe with humble gratitude  as from the   hand of Heaven  nor will mention any other return but what   must be made to that  till it shall be pleased to bless me with   better ability    Then pulling out his pocket book    Here is the   account of what I owe    continued he  giving him some papers and   a purse containing little more than his share of the price of the   smuggler s boat     and here is all my worldly wealth  which is   no more than an assignment of my miserable prize money  and   these few pieces of gold  thrown by fortune in my way  mostly   since our hands were tied up by the capitulation  For the balance   I miist be your debtor          For the balance    answered the captain  returning the purse   and the assignment    No  you shall be my debtor  if you will call   it so  for the whole  It would be strange friendship to strip you   of everything  You may want yourself          Excuse me  sir    interrupted my master  unable to suppress   the delicacy  the dignity of honour     I am not so low a wretch   as to accept of more than I indispensably want   and that for persons   dearer to me than myself  If you will not permit me to make   the debt as light as I can  it is impossible for me to receive your   friendship  however essential to the happiness of my heart  I   am sorry you should have entertained so mean an opinion of me        I have the highest opinion of you    replied the captain  who   saw what pain he had given him     and spoke in the warmth of   my regard  without the most distant design of giving you offence    But you shalll make your own terms  on this condition  though    that if you have any occasion for money  you will apply to me with   the freedom of a friend        To such a proposal it was impossible to refuse assenting  My   master complied  and the captain taking the money  etc   from him    desired that he would order a signal to be made for the packet    and write his letters  while he himself should draw a bill upon his   agent  The sentiments expressed by the captain made it a pleasure   to me to pass into his service on this occasion  As soon as the   lieutenant went out  my new master walked a turn or two about   his cabin  in the exalted happiness of conscious virtue   and then   drawing a bill for considerably more than the lieutenant was to   pay  he desired that he should be called  and when he entered      I beg yoiu  pardon    said he    for interrupting you  but it is to   desire that you will present my compliments to your wife  and tell   her I beg she will accept of a trifling present from me  which I have   taken the liberty to include in the bill  Come   no words I In   this I will not be contradicted          Oh  sir     answered the lieutenant  catching his hand  as he         3i2 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     reached him the bill  and kissing it eagerly    this is too much     my heart  wdll burst    Saying  which he went out of the cabin in   a silence more expressive of his soul than all the flights of eloquence          CHAPTER III     HISTORY or A LIEUTENANT OF A MAN OF WAE â€” A COMPAEISOK   BETWEEN THE EEWAEDS OF MEEIT IN THE LAND AND SEA
