name was Ferret  and his character distinguished by three peculiarities  He was never seen to smile  he was never heard to speak in praise of any person whatsoever  and he was never known to give a direct answer to any question that was asked  but seemed  on all occasions  to be actuated by the most perverse spirit of contradiction   Captain Crowe  having remarked that it was squally weather  asked how far it was to the next market town  and understanding that the distance was not less than six miles  said he had a good mind to come to an anchor for the night  if so be as he could have a tolerable berth in this here harbour  Mr  Fillet  perceiving by his style that he was a seafaring gentleman  observed that their landlady was not used to lodge such company  and expressed some surprise that he  who had no doubt endured so many storms and hardships at sea  should think much of travelling five or six miles a horseback by moonlight   For my part   said he   I ride in all weathers  and at all hours  without minding cold  wet  wind  or darkness  My constitution is so case hardened that I believe I could live all the year at Spitzbergen  With respect to this road  I know every foot of it so exactly  that I ll engage to travel forty miles upon it blindfold  without making one false step  and if you have faith enough to put yourselves under my auspices  I will conduct you safe to an elegant inn  where you will meet with the best accommodation    Thank you  brother   replied the captain   we are much beholden to you for your courteous offer  but  howsomever  you must not think I mind foul weather more than my neighbours  I have worked hard aloft and alow in many a taut gale  but this here is the case  d ye see  we have run down a long day s reckoning  our beasts have had a hard spell  and as for my own hap  brother  I doubt my bottom planks have lost some of their sheathing  being as how I a n t used to that kind of scrubbing    The doctor  who had practised aboard a man of war in his youth  and was perfectly well acquainted with the captain s dialect  assured him that if his bottom was damaged he would new pay it with an excellent salve  which he always carried about him to guard against such accidents on the road  But Tom Clarke  who seemed to have cast the eyes of affection upon the landlady s eldest daughter  Dolly  objected to their proceeding farther without rest and refreshment  as they had already travelled fifty miles since morning  and he was sure his uncle must be fatigued both in mind and body  from vexation  as well as from hard exercise  to which he had not been accustomed  Fillet then desisted  saying  he was sorry to find the captain had any cause of vexation  but he hoped it was not an incurable evil  This expression was accompanied with a look of curiosity  which Mr  Clarke was glad of an occasion to gratify  for  as we have hinted above  he was a very communicative gentleman  and the affair which now lay upon his stomach interested him nearly    I ll assure you  sir   said he   this here gentleman  Captain Crowe  who is my mother s own brother  has been cruelly used by some of his relations  He bears as good a character as any captain of a ship on the Royal Exchange  and has undergone a variety of hardships at sea  What d ye think  now  of his bursting all his sinews  and making his eyes start out of his head  in pulling his ship off a rock  whereby he saved to his owners ——Here he was interrupted by the captain  who exclaimed   Belay  Tom  belay  pr ythee  don t veer out such a deal of jaw  Clap a stopper on thy cable and bring thyself up  my lad—what a deal of stuff thou has pumped up concerning bursting and starting  and pulling ships  Laud have mercy upon us —look ye here  brother—look ye here—mind these poor crippled joints  two fingers on the starboard  and three on the larboard hand  crooked  d ye see  like the knees of a bilander  I ll tell you what  brother  you seem to be a—ship deep laden—rich cargo—current setting into the bay—hard gale—lee shore— all hands in the boat—tow round the headland—self pulling for dear blood  against the whole crew—snap go the finger braces—crack went the eye blocks  Bounce daylight—flash starlight—down I foundered  dark as hell—whiz went my ears  and my head spun like a whirligig  That don t signify—I m a Yorkshire boy  as the saying is—all my life at sea  brother  by reason of an old grandmother and maiden aunt  a couple of old stinking—kept me these forty years out of my grandfather s estate  Hearing as how they had taken their departure  came ashore  hired horses  and clapped on all my canvas  steering to the northward  to take possession of my—But it don t signify
