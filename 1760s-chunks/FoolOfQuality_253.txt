 that all usurpations of such powers throughout the earth  with all   actual or pretended covenants  trusts  or grants  for the investiture   or conveyance of such illicit powers  are null and void on the exe    cution   and that no man  or nations of men  can possibly be bound   by any consents or contracts  eversive of the laws of God and their   own nature  of common sense and general equity  of eternal reason   and truth      I beg pardon  sir  says Harry  for interrupting you once more     but you desire that I should always speak my mind with freedom    You have delighted me greatly with the account which you gave of   the benefits and sweets of Liberty  and of its being equally the   claim and birthright of all men   and I wish to heaven that they had   an equal enjoyment thereof  But this you know  sir  is very far from   being the case   and that this animating fire  which ought to comfort   all who come into the world  is now nearly extinguished throughout   the earth      sir   if this divine  golden law of liberty were observed  if all   were restrained from doing injury to any  what a heaven we should   speedily have upon earth   The habit of such a restraint would in   time suppress every motion to evil  The weak would have the   mightiness of this law for their support   the poor would have the   benevolence thereof for their riches  Under the light and delight    some yoke of such a restraint  how would industry be encouraged   to plant and to multiply the vine and the fig tree  how would   benignity rejoice to call neighbours and strangers to come and   fearlessly partake of the fruits thereof       How has the sacred name of all benefiting Liberty been perverted   and profaned by the mouths of madding demagogues  at the head of   their shouting rabble  who mean no other than a licentious un    muzzling from all restraint  that they may ravage and lay desolate   the works and fruits of peace       But liberty  in your system  is a real and essential good   the   only source  indeed  whence any good can arise  I see it  I revere   it   it shines by its own light in the evidence of your description       How is it  then  sir  that there are persons so blind or so bigoted   against their own interests and those of their fellows  as to declaim   with much energy and studied argumentation against this divine    inheritable  and indefeasible right  not of kings  as it should seem     but of human kind      1 lately happened in company with a number of discontentedly    looking gentlemen  whom I supposed to have been abettors of the         268 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      late King James  and friends to the arrogating family of the   Stewarts  Among them was one of some learning and great clever    ness  and he paraded and showed away at a vast rate concerning   the divinely inherent right of monarchs  implicit submission  passive   obedience  non resistance  and what not      Our God  said he  is one God  and the substitutes of his mightiness   should resemble himself   their power ought to be absolute  un    questioned  and undivided  The sun is his glorious representative   in the heavens   and monarchs are his representatives and mirrors   upon earth  in whom he is pleased to behold the reflection of his   own majesty      Accordingly we find  that the monarchs over his chosen people   were of his special appointment  and that  their persons were   rendered sacred and awfully inviolable  by unction or the shedding   of hallowed oil upon them  Many miscarriages and woful defaults   are recorded of Saul as a man   yet  as a king  he was held perfect   in the eyes of his people  What an unhesitating obedience  what a   speechless submission  do they pay to all his behests I Though he   massacred their whole priesthood  to a man  in one day  yet no   murmur was heard no one dared to wag a tongue  and much less   to lift a finger  against the Lord s anointed      I own to you  sir  that this last argument staggered me   such an   express authority of the sacred writings put me wholly to silence    Say then  my dearest father  give me the benefit of your en    lightening sentiments on this head  that I may know  on all
