much more noble to forgive an injury than to resent it  and to give a life than to take it  My Father  I honour his memory  was a man of gaiety  of munificence  He had great qualities  But my Mother was my oracle  And he was always so just to her merit  as to command me to consider her as such  and the rather  he used to say  as she distinguished well between the false glory and the true  and would not have her boy a coward   Mr  Mer  A good beginning  by my life   Mr  Jord  Pray proceed  Sir Charles  I am all attention   Sir Har  Ay  ay  we all listen   Mr  Bag  Curse him that speaks next  to interrupt you   Sir Ch  But what indelibly impressed upon my heart my Mother s lessons  was an occurrence  which  and the consequences of it  I shall ever deplore  My Father  having taken leave of my Mother  on a proposed absence of a few days  was  in an hour after  brought home  as it was thought mortally wounded in a duel  My Mother s surprise on this occasion threw her into fits  from which she never after was wholly free  And these  and the dangerous way he continued in for some time  brought her into an ill state of health  broke  in short  her constitution  so that  in less than a twelvemonth  my Father  to his inexpressible anguish of mind  continually reproaching himself on the occasion  lost the best of Wives  and my Sisters and I the best of Mothers and Instructors   My concern for my Father  on whom I was an hourly attendant throughout the whole time of his confinement  and my being by that means a witness of what both he and my mother suffered  completed   57 my abhorrence of the vile practice of duelling  I went on  however  in endeavouring to make myself a master of the science  as it is called  and  among the other weapons  of the staff  the better to enable me to avoid drawing my sword  and to impower me  if called to the occasion  to give  and not take  a life  and the rather  as the custom was so general  that a young man of spirit and fortune  at one time or other  could hardly expect to escape a provocation of this sort   My Father once had a view  at the persuasion of my Mother s Brother  who was a general of note and interest in the Imperial service  and who was very fond of a military life  and of me  to make a soldier of me  tho  an only son  and I wanted not when a boy  a turn that way  But the disgust I had conceived on the above occasion  against duelling  and the consideration of the absurd alternative which the gentlemen of our army are under  either to accept a challenge  contrary to laws divine and human  or to be broke  if they do not  though a soldier is the least master of himself  or of his own life  of any man in the community  made me think the English service  tho  that of my country  the least eligible of all services  And for a man  who was born to so considerable a stake in it  to devote himself to another  as my Uncle had done  from principles which I approved not  I could not but hesitate on the proposal  young as I was  As it soon became a maxim with me  not to engage  even in a national cause  without examining the justice of it  it will be the less wonder d at  that I could not think of any foreign service   Mr  Bag  Then you have never seen service  Sir Charles   Sir Ch  Yes  I made one campaign as a volunteer  notwithstanding what I have said  I was then in the midst of marching armies  and could not tell how to abate the ardor those martial movements had   58 raised in my breast  But  unless my country were to be unjustly invaded by a foreign enemy  I think I would not  on any consideration  be drawn into the field again   Mr  Jord  But you lead from the point  Mr  Bagenhall  Sir Charles was going to say somewhat more on the subject of duelling   Sir Ch  When I was thus unhappily deprived of my Mother  my Father  in order to abate my grief  I was very much grieved  was pleased to consent to my going abroad  in order to make the Grand Tour  as it is called  having first visited all the British dominions in Europe  Gibraltar and Minorca excepted  I then supposing I might fall into circumstances that might affect the principles my mother had been so careful to instil into me  and to which my father s danger  and her death  had added force  it was natural for me to look into history  for the rise and progress of a custom so much and so justly my aversion  and
