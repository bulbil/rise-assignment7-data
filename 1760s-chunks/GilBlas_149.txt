fate  A nobility of sentiment like this speaks at once to the heart of Seraphina  and while it undeceives  makes me the less repine at a stranger being witness of an affront offered to my family  Yes  I own my error  and revolt not  unknown as you are  from your proffered aid  But the death of Don Ferdinand is not what I require  Well  then  madam  resumed I  of what nature are the services you would enjoin me  Sir  replied Seraphina  the ground of my complaint is this  Don Ferdinand de Leyva is enamoured of my sister Julia  whom he met with by accident at Toledo  where we for the most part reside  Three months since  he asked her in marriage of the Count de Polan  my father  who refused his consent on account of an old grudge subsisting between the families  My sister is not yet fifteen  she must have been indiscreet enough to follow the evil counsels of my woman  whom Don Ferdinand has doubtless bribed  and this daring ruffian  advertised of our being alone at our country house  has taken the opportunity of carrying off Julia  At least I should like to know what hiding place he has chosen to deposit her in  that my father and my brother  who have been these two months at Madrid  may take their measures accordingly  For heaven s sake  added she  give yourself the trouble of examining the neighbourhood of Toledo  an act so heinous cannot escape detection  and my family will owe you a debt of ever lasting gratitude   The lady was little aware how unseasonable an employment she was thrusting upon me  My escape from Castile could not be too soon effected  and yet how should such a reflection ever enter into her head  when it was completely superseded in mine by a more powerful suggestion  Delighted at finding myself important to the most lovely creature in the universe  I caught at the commission with eagerness  and promised to acquit myself of it with equal zeal and industry  In fact  I did not wait for daybreak  to go about fulfilling my engagement  A hasty leave of Seraphina gave me occasion to beg her pardon for the alarm I had caused her  and to assure her that she should speedily hear some what of my adventure  I went out as I came in  but so wrapped up in admiration of the lady  that it was palpable I was completely caught  My sense of this truth was the more confirmed  by the eagerness with which I embarked in by the romantic  gaily  coloured bubbles which my passion blew  It struck my fancy that Seraphina  though engrossed by her affliction  had remarked the hasty birth of my love  without being displeased at the discovery  I even flattered myself that if I could furnish her with any certain intelligence of her sister  and the business should terminate in any degree to her satisfaction  my part in it would be remembered to my advantage   Don Alphonso broke the thread of his discourse at this passage  and said to our aged host  I beg your pardon  father  if the fullness of my passion should lead me to dilate too long upon particulars  wearisome and uninteresting to a stranger  No  my son  replied the hermit  such particulars are not wearisome  I am interested to know the state and progress of your passion for the young lady you are speaking of  my counsels will be influenced by the minute detail you are giving me   With my fancy heated by these seductive images  resumed the young man  I was two days hunting after Julia s ravisher  but in vain were all the inquiries that could be made  by no means I could devise was the least trace of him to be discovered  Deeply mortified at the unsuccessful issue of my search  I bent my steps back to Seraphina  whom I pictured to myself as overwhelmed with uneasiness  Yet she was in better spirits than might have been expected  She informed me that her success had been better than mine  for she had learned how her sister was disposed of  She had received a letter from Don Ferdinand himself  importing that after being privately married to Julia  he had placed her in a convent at Toledo  I have sent his letter to my father  pursued Seraphina  I hope the affair may be adjusted amicably  and that a solemn marriage will soon extinguish the feuds which have so long kept our respective families at variance   When the lady had thus informed me of her sister s fate  she began making an apology for the trouble she had given me  as well as the danger into which she might imprudently have thrown me  by engaging my services in pursuit of a ravisher  without recollecting what I had told her  that an affair of honour had been the occasion of my flight  Her excuses were couched in such flattering terms  as to convert her very oversight into an obligation  As rest was desirable for me after my journey  she conducted me into the saloon  where we sat down together  She wore an undress gown of white taffety with black stripes  and a little hat of the same materials with black feathers  which gave me reason to suppose that
