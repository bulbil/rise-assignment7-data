 make any efforts for the vanquishing his passion  he still protested   that he neither could cease to love her  and her alone  nor even to wish   an alteration in his sentiments       By what has been already said of the extreme liking which the first   fight of this young gentleman inspired Louisa with  it may easily be   supposed she could not hear his complaints  and be witness of the   anxieties she was enforced to inflict on him  without feeling at least   an equal share  she endeavoured not to conceal the pity she had for him    but he now found that was far from being all he wanted  because it   forwarded not  as he at first imagined  the progress of his hopes  but   rather shewed them at more distance than ever       The business of his love so engrossed his thoughts during this visit    that he almost forgot to mention any thing of the count s designs upon   her  and she as little remembered to remind him of it  tho  he told her   on his entrance  that he had something to acquaint her with on his   subject  and it was not till he was going to take leave that it came   into his head  When he had related it to her  she assured him that she   took the caution he gave her as a new proof of his friendship  which    said she  I shall always prize  At parting  she permitted him to salute   her  and gave her promise not to refuse seeing him while they continued   in that city  but told him at the same time  that he must not expect any   thing from his repeated visits more than she had already granted       He durst not at that time press her any farther  but fetched a deep sigh   as he went out of the room  accompanied with a look more expressive than   any words could be of the discontent he laboured under  while she    oppressed beneath the double weight of his and her own grief  remained   in a condition he was little able to form any conjecture of       Pleased as she was with the presence of the only man who had ever had   power of inspiring her with one tender thought  yet a thousand times she   had wished him gone before he went  that she might be at liberty to give   vent to the struggling passions which were more than once ready to throw   her into a swoon  The perfections she saw in the person of her   lover   the respect he treated her with  notwithstanding the violence of   the passion he was possessed of   the sincerity that appeared in all his   looks and words   the generosity of his behaviour in regard to her   fortune   all the qualifications that would have made any other woman   blessed in the offer of such a heart  served but to make her wretched    since she could not look on herself in a condition capable of   accepting it       Alas  du Plessis  cried she  little do you think to whom you would ally   yourself   you would  you say  despise a portion  but would you marry a   foundling  a child of charity  one that has neither name nor friends    and who  in her best circumstances  is but a poor dependant  a servant   in effect  tho  not in shew  and owes her very cloaths to the bounty of   another   Oh  why did the mistaken goodness of Dorilaus give me any   other education than such as befitted my wretched fortune  Better I had   been bred an humble drudge  and never been taught how to distinguish   merit   What avail the accomplishments that cost him so much money  and   me so much pains to acquire  but to attract a short liv d admiration    which  when I am truly known  will be succeeded with an adequate   derision   Could I but say I was descended from honest  tho  mean   parents  I would not murmur at my fate  but I have none   none to own   me   I am a nothing   a kind of reptile in humanity  and have been shewn   in a genteel way of life only to make my native misery more conspicuous       Thus did love represent her unhappy circumstances in their worst   colours  and render her  which till now she had never been  thankless to   heaven for all the good she had received  since it seemed to deny her   the only good her passion coveted  that of being in a condition to   reward the affection of her dear du Plessis       A torrent of tears at length somewhat mitigated the violence of her   passion
