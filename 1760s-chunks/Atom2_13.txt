Dairo till his dyingday —After her death  the ministry  intimidated by the boldness of his tropes  and the fame he began to acquire as a mal content orator  made him such offers as he thought proper to accept  and then he turned She it kums hi til —Being disgusted in the sequel  at his own want of importance in the   73 council  he opened once more at the head of his old friends the Shi tilk ums hitites  and once more he deserted them to rule the roast  as chief of the She it kums hi tilites  in which predicament he now stood  And  indeed  this was the most natural posture in which he could stand  for this party embraced all the scum of the people  constituting the blatant beast  which his talents were so peculiarly adapted to manage and govern  Another impracticable maxim of Yak strot  was the abolition of corruption  the ordure of which is as necessary to anoint the wheels of government in Japan  as grease is to smear the axle tree of a loaded waggon  His third impolitic  tho  not impracticable  maxim  was that of making peace while the populace were intoxicated with the steams of blood  and elated with the shews of triumph  Be that as it will  Giogio    74 attended by Yak strot  was drawing plans of windmills  when Orator Taycho  opening the door  advanced towards him  and falling on his knees  addressed him in these words     The empire of Japan  magnanimous prince   resembles at this instant  a benighted traveller  who by the light of the star Hesperus continued his journey without repining  until that glorious luminary setting  left him bewildered in darkness and consternation  but scarce had he time to bewail his fate  when the more glorious sun  the ruler of a fresh day  appearing on the tops of the Eastern hills  dispelled his terrors with the shades of night  and filled his soul with transports of pleasure and delight  The illustrious Got hama baba  of honoured memory  is the glorious star which hath set on our hemisphere —His soul  which took wing about two hours ago  is now   75 happily nestled in the bosom of the blessed Bupo  and you  my prince  are the more glorious rising sun  whose genial influence will chear the empire  and gladden the hearts of your faithful Japonese —I therefore hail your succession to the throne  and cry aloud  Long live the ever glorious Gio gio  emperor of the three islands of Japan    To this salutation the beast below brayed hoarse applause  and all present kissed the hand of the new emperor  who  kneeling before his venerable grandame  craved her blessing  desiring the benefit of her prayers  that God would make him a good king  and establish his throne in righteousness  Then he ascended his chariot  accompanied by the Orator and his beloved Yak strot  and proceeding to the palace of Meaco  was proclaimed with the usual ceremonies  his relation the Fatz man and other princes of   76 the blood assisting on this occasion     The first step he took after his elevation  was to publish a decree  or rather exhortation  to honour religion and the Bonzes  and this was no impolitic expedient  for it firmly attached that numerous and powerful tribe to his interest  His next measures did not seem to be directed by the same spirit of discretion  He admitted a parcel of raw boys  and even some individuals of the faction of Shi tilk ums heit into his council  and though Taycho still continued to manage the reins of administration  Yak strot was associated with him in office  to the great scandal and dissatisfaction of the Niphonites  who hate all the Ximians with a mixture of jealousy and contempt   Fika kaka was not the last who payed his respects to his new sovereign  by whom he was graciously received  altho  he did not seem quite satisfied  because when   77 he presented himself in his usual attitude  he had not received the kick of approbation  New reigns  new customs  This Dairo never dreamed of kicking those whom he delighted to honour —It was a secret of state which had not yet come to his knowledge  and Yak strot had always assured him  that kicking the breech always and every where implied disgrace  as kicking the parts before  betokens ungovernable passion  Yak strot  however  in this particular  seems to have been too confined in his notions of the etiquette  for it had been the custom time immemorial for the Dairos of Japan to kick their favourites and prime ministers  Besides  there are at this day different sorts of kicks used even in England  without occasioning any dishonour to the Kickee —It is sometimes a misfortune to be kicked out of place  but no dishonour  A man   78 is often kicked up in the way of preferment  in order that his place may be given to a person of more interest  Then there is the amorous kick  called Kick  um  Jenny  which every gallant undergoes with pleasure  hence the old English appellation of Kicksy wicksy  bestowed on a wanton leman who knew all her paces  As for the familiar kick  it is
