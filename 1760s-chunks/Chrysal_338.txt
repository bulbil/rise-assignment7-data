e  Frederick   Prince of Wales  physicians in his last illness  and whom Whitehead    from whatever motive  strives to justify by indiscriminate abuse of   the  college    He was one of the  monks  of Medmenham          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 403     them in disgrace  Encouraged by this success  he boldly ven    tured upon a stroke  the event of which was to decide his hopes    In gratification to his own depraved taste  he had written a treatise    in which the grossest libertinism was set in so advantageous and   alluring a light  and the arguments against it evaded with so much   plausibility and true wit  as were almost sufficient to put virtue   out of countenance  and debauch its sincerest votaries  The con    tradiction between such principles and the practice of his patron    through his whole life  would have deterred any one less enter    prising and experienced in the weaknesses of human nature from   disclosing them   but he had lately made some discoveries  which   emboldened him even to push his designs much further than owning   himself the author of that book      While the vigour of life had enabled his patron to persist in busier   pursuits  he had despised the flattery paid to his Uterary merits     but as soon as the infirmities of age rendered him unfit for such   employment  he  with a natural partiality  gave the preference to   that pre eminence which he thought still within his reach  and   affected to slight all fame that was not founded on the nobler labours   of the mind  This was a sufficient direction to the parasite  He   immediately showed his book  with a mysterious air  to several of   his patron s friends  giving them broad hints at the same time    but under the seal of secrecy  that he was the author of it  There   is no way so effectual as this to spread any story  One whispered   it to another  till  in a few days  the whole town was in the secret      The hints and allusions which were every hour thrown out to   the patron on this occasion perplexed him not a little  as he knew   not what they meant  A secret  though in the possession of so   many  could not possibly remain long such to him  One of his   acquaintances  provoked at the seeming affectation of his not   imderstanding his hints  told him the whole affair      Much as he was surprised at the account  vanity would not let   him suppress it by a direct negative  as the book was mentioned   in terms of the highest praise  He answered with the coy evasions   of modesty  the most effectual affirmation  and shifted off any   further discussion of the subject  till he should be better informed    Accordingly  the moment his friend left him  he sent for the author   of the report  and charging him with it  desired to see the perform    ance which he had done him the honour to father upon him  The   parasite  who took his cue from the looks of his patron  was far from   denying the charge  He presented him the book without hesita    tion  saying  with his usual bluntness  that if it was not actually   written by him  it was literally written from him  being nothing but   what he had frequently said on those subjects  and  therefore    might without any injustice be asserted to be his      The advantageous manner in which the patron had heard the   book spoken of prevented his making any reply  till he should have   read it  when he was so struck with the various beauties of it  that   vanity subdued all his virtue  and deprived him of the power of   denying it        If   the sentiments are mine    said he  blushing at his own   baseness as he spoke    I am obliged to you for placing them in so         404 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     advantageous a ligkt  and think I ought to decline sharing in an   honour  so much of which belongs to another        Such a repulse was no way discouraging  The parasite repeated   his assertion that the whole was genuinely his  both in words and   sentiments  as indeed  he knew not any other whose they could   be   and insisting that he had no more merit in the affair than   barely that of writing them down  a liberty for which he begged   pardon  appealed to his former conduct to acquit him of so mean   a piece of flattery  as
