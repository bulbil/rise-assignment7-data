 Silleri  Feb  10   I Have mentioned my plan to Emily  who is charmed with it   tis a pretty evening amusement for two solitary girls in the country       Behold the first fruits of our correspondence     To Miss FERMOR        It is not to you  my dear girl  I need vindicate my conduct in regard to Sir George  you have from the first approved it  you have even advised it  If I have been to blame   tis in having too long delayed an explanation on a point of such importance to us both  I have been long on the borders of a precipice  without courage to retire from so dangerous a situation  overborn by my family  I have been near marrying a man for whom I have not the least tenderness  and whose conversation is even now tedious to me        My dear friend  we were not formed for each other  our minds have not the least resemblance  Have you not observed that  when I have timidly hazarded my ideas on the delicacy necessary to keep love alive in marriage  and the difficulty of preserving the heart of the object beloved in so intimate an union  he has indolently assented  with a coldness not to be described  to sentiments which it is plain from his manner he did not understand  whilst another  not interested in the conversation  has  by his countenance  by the fire of his eyes  by looks more eloquent than all language  shewed his soul was of intelligence with mine        A strong sense of the force of engagements entered into with my consent  though not the effect of my free  unbiassed choice  and the fear of making Sir George  by whom I supposed myself beloved  unhappy  have thus long prevented my resolving to break with him for ever  and though I could not bring myself to marry him  I found myself at the same time incapable of assuming sufficient resolution to tell him so   till his mother s letter gave me so happy an occasion        There is no saying what transport I feel in being freed from the insupportable yoke of this engagement  which has long sat heavy on my heart  and suspended the natural chearfulness of my temper        Yes  my dear  your Emily has been wretched  without daring to confess it even to you  I was ashamed of owning I had entered into such engagements with a man whom I had never loved  though I had for a short time mistaken esteem for a greater degree of affection than my heart ever really knew  How fatal  my dear Bell  is this mistake to half our sex  and how happy am I to have discovered mine in time        I have scarce yet asked myself what I intend  but I think it will be most prudent to return to England in the first ship  and retire to a relation of my mother s in the country  where I can live with decency on my little fortune        Whatever is my fate  no situation can be equally unhappy with that of being wife to a man for whom I have not even the slightest friendship or esteem  for whose conversation I have not the least taste  and who  if I know him  would for ever think me under an obligation to him for marrying me        I have the pleasure to see I give no pain to his heart  by a step which has relieved mine from misery  his feelings are those of wounded vanity  not of love    Adieu  Your   EMILY MONTAGUE         I have no patience with relations  Lucy  this sweet girl has been two years wretched under the bondage her uncle s avarice  for he foresaw Sir George s acquisition  though she did not  prepared for her  Parents should chuse our company  but never even pretend to direct our choice  if they take care we converse with men of honor only  tis impossible we can chuse amiss  a conformity of taste and sentiment alone can make marriage happy  and of that none but the parties concerned can judge       By the way  I think long engagements  even between persons who love  extremely unfavorable to happiness  it is certainly right to be long enough acquainted to know something of each other s temper  but  tis bad to let the first fire burn out before we come together  and when we have once resolved  I have no notion of delaying a moment       If I should ever consent to marry Fitzgerald  and he should not fly for a licence before I had finished the sentence  I would dismiss him if there was not another lover to be had in Canada       Adieu   Your faithful  A  FERMOR       My Emily is now free as air  a sweet little bird escaped from the gilded cage  Are you not glad of it  Lucy  I am amazingly     LETTER LXVI   66   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Quebec  Feb  11   WOULD one think it possible  Lucy  that Sir George should console himself for the
