the three persons in the world nearest my heart  vying with each other in their testimonies of affection and gratitude  The pleasure my zeal seemed personally to give them  was equal to the dignity conferred on their house by the post of viceroy  They even talked with me on a footing of equality  and scarcely remembered my original distance or servitude in the fervour of their present feelings  But not to dwell on unnecessary topics  Don Alphonso having taken the oaths and returned thanks  left Madrid with his family  to take up his abode at Saragossa  He made his public entry with appropriate magnificence  and the Arragonese caused it to appear  by their cordial reception  that I had a very pretty knack at picking out a viceroy       CH  XIII     Gil Blas meets Don Gaston de Cogollos and Don Andrew de Tordesillas at the drawing room  and adjourns with them to a more convenient place  The story of Don Gaston and Donna Helena de Galisteo concluded  Santillane renders some service to Tordesillas   I WAS up to the hilts in joy at having so marvellously metamorphosed an ex governor into a viceroy  the Lords of Leyva themselves were not primed and loaded so near to bursting  But very soon I had another opportunity of employing my credit in the beaten track of friendship  and there is the more occasion to quote these instances  that my readers may clearly discern with how different a man they are in company  from that graceless Gil Blas who  under the former ministry  carried on a shameless traffic in the honours and emoluments of the state   One day I was waiting in the king s ante chamber  in conversation with some noblemen  who  knowing me to stand well with the prime minister  were not ashamed of taking me by the hand  In the crowd was Don Gaston de Cogollos  whom I had left a prisoner in the tower of Segovia  He was with Don Andrew de Tordesillas  the warden  I readily quitted my company to go and renew my acquaintance with my two friends  If they were astonished at the sight of me  I was no less so to find them here  After mutual greetings  Don Gaston said  Signor de Santillane  we have many inquiries to make of each other  and this place affords little opportunity for private intercourse  allow me to request your company where we may open our hearts freely  I made no objection  we pushed our way through the crowd  and left the palace  Don Gaston s carriage was ready waiting in the street  we all three got into it  and drove to the great market place  where the bull  fights are exhibited  There Cogollos lived in a very handsome house   Signor Gil Blas  said Don Andrew on our entrance  at your departure from Segovia you seemed to have conceived a thorough hatred against the court  and to have formed a settled purpose of abandoning it for ever  Such was  in fact  my design  answered I  nor were my sentiments at all changed during the lifetime of the late king  but when the prince his son came to the throne  I had a mind to see whether the new monarch would know me again  He did so  and received me favourably  with a strong recommendation to the prime minister  who admitted me to his friendship  and took me more into his confidence than ever did the Duke of Lerma  This  Signor Don Andrew  is my story  And now tell me whether you still hold your office in the tower of Segovia  No  indeed  answered he  my lord duke has removed me  and put another in my room  He probably considered me as entirely devoted to his predecessor  And I  said Don Gaston  was set at liberty for the contrary reason  the prime minister was no sooner informed that my imprisonment was by the Duke of Lerma s order  than he ordered me to be released  The present business  Signor Gil Blas  is to relate the subsequent particulars of my adventures   The first thing I did  continued he  after thanking Don Andrew for his kind attentions during my confinement  was to repair to Madrid  I presented myself before the Count Duke of Olivarez  who said  You need not be apprehensive of any blemish on your character in consequence of your late misfortune  you are honourably acquitted  nay  your innocence is so much the more satisfactorily established  as the Marquis of Villareal  with whom you were supposed to be implicated  was not guilty  Though a Portuguese  and related to the Duke of Braganza  he is less in his interests than in those of the king my master  That connection  therefore  ought not to have been imputed to you as a crime  but  to repair your wrongs  the king has given you a lieutenant s commission in the Spanish guards  This I accepted  begging it as a favour of his excellency to allow me  before I joined my regiment  to go and see my aunt  Donna Eleonora de Laxarilla  at Coria  The minister gave me leave of absence for a month  and I departed with only one servant  We had got beyond Colmenar  and were
