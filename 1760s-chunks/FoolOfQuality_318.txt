 I can t suffer the thought  she cried  and burst forth into   tears I could not bear  I could not bear to die a thousand deaths   in the death of my Harry       But  said Harry  in order to divert her passion  you have not yet   inquired after the man with the beard  the old rogue   exclaimed   nurse  I can t think of him with patience  Ay  but you must know   that that same old rogue is my own darling uncle  an own and only   dear brother to my own dear father here  If that is the case    said nurse  I don t wonder he should so greatly yearn after you     and indeed I would rather wonder if all the world did not yearn   and long after you  my love       And now  nurse  to show you how much you are obliged to this   same darling uncle  he has ordered me to make you a present of   five hundred pounds  in payment  as he says  of the grief he   has cost you  And take no heed for your children  I will take   that care upon myself  for this same dear uncle has made me   a gift of the lands  and house  and plate  and furniture  that he   has in this town  and so you see I am well able to provide for   you all      Here my lord cast an eye of tender jealousy upon Harry      I perceive  my son  said he  that your uncle is your only trust    the only dependence that you choose to have upon earth  Harry    with a glance of his eye  instantly caught the meaning of the eye   of his father  and throwing himself at his feet O pardon  my   lord   he cried   pray  pardon the overflowings of a grateful and   simple heart  My uncle is my property  but I am yours  my   father  to be disposed of in life and in death  at your pleasure    I do trust  I do depend upon you  my father   and you have already   overpowered me with the weight of your affections      My lord s eyes then glistened  and raising his son  and taking   him fondly to his bosom I believe I have been wrong  my love    said he  and hereafter I shall always think so  rather than think   any thing amiss in my Harry  But tell me  my dear  and tell me   sincerely  you speak of your uncle as one of the richest and   greatest men upon earth as a prince as an emperor enabled to   give away fortunes and provinces at pleasure      And he is  my lord  cried Harry he is greater than any prince   or emperor upon earth  To speak only of his temporal wealth   or power the most inconsiderable part of his value he can do    as I may say  what he pleases in England  The ministry are at his   beck they profess themselves his servants   and even his majesty   acknowledges himself deeply his debtor  and owes him  I daresay    half a million      And yet this is the man  exclaimed the earl  turning an eye of   penitence on Mr  Meekly  this is the man  as I told you  my friend    on whom I looked down with such provoking contempt whom I   treated with such unpardonable insolence and ignominy       My lord then inquired concerning the personal adventures of our   hero in London  the account of which would have been more   entertaining  had not Harry suppressed throughout his narration   whatever he apprehended might tend to his own honour          THE FOOL OF QUALITY          349         As soon as the fosterers had taken their leave  my lord proposed   to his remaining guests a walk in the gardens  and after a few   turns they sat down in a rural arbour  that was interwoven all   about with jessamine and honeysuckle      Mr  Meekly  said the earl  I have often longed to hear the   particulars of your life   and how you came to live by faith  and   not by sight  and to hold your conversation in heaven  as you do   at this day      I can soon obey your lordship  answered Meekly   for my story   is very short and very simple  and no way adorned with uncommon   incidents      My mother died a few hours after I was born  My father did not   survive her two years
