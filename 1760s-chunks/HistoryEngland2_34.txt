or so sincere  as the sufferers would fondly persuade us  The loss of King William was  at first thought  irreparable  but the prosperity of the kingdom seemed to acquire new vigour under his successor Queen Anne  This Princess was the second daughter of King James by his first wife  she was  by the mother s side descended from Chancellor Hyde  afterwards the Earl of Clarendon  and had been married to the Prince of Denmark  before her accession to the crown  She ascended the throne in the thirty eighth year of her age  having undergone many vicissitudes after the expulsion of her father  and many severe mortifications during the reign of the late King  But  naturally possessed of an even serene temper  she either was insensible of the disrespect shewn her  or had wisdom to conceal her resentment   She came to the throne with the same hostile dispositions toward France  in which the late Monarch died  She was wholly guided by the Countess of Marlborough  a woman of masculine spirit  and remarkable for intrigue  both in politics and gallantry  This lady advised a vigorous exertion of the English power against France  as she had already marked the Earl  her husband  for conducting all the operations both in the cabinet and the field  Thus influenced  the Queen took early measures to confirm her allies  the Dutch  with assurances of union and assistance   Lewis XIV  now grown familiar with disappointment and disgrace  yet still spurring on an exhausted kingdom to second the views of his ambition  expected  from the death of King William  a field open for conquests and glory  The vigilance of his late rival   91 had blasted his laurels  and circumscribed his power  for  even after a defeat  William still was formidable  At the news of his death therefore the French Monarch could not suppress his joy  and his court at Versailles seemed to have forgotten its usual decorum in the sincerity of their rapture  But their pleasure was soon to determine  a much more formidable enemy was now rising up to oppose them  a more able warrior  one backed by the efforts of an indulgent mistress and a willing nation   Immediately  upon the Queen s accession  war was declared against the French King  and that Monarch was accused of attempting to unite the crown of Spain to his own dominions  by placing his grandson upon the throne of that kingdom  thus attempting to destroy the equality of power among the states of Europe  This declaration was soon seconded with vigorous efforts  an alliance was formed between the Imperialists  the Dutch  and the English  who contributed more to the support of the war than the other two united  Marlborough was sent over to command the English army  and the allies declared him generalissimo of all their forces  Never was a man better calculated for debate and action than he  serene in the midst of danger  and cool in all the fury of battle  While his Countess governed the Queen  his intrigues governed the kingdom  An indefatigable warrior while in camp  and a skilful politician in courts  he thus became the most fatal enemy to France that England had produced  since the conquering times of Cressy and Agincourt   This general had learned the art of war under the famous Marshal Turenne  having been a voluntier in his army  He  at that time  went by the name of the Handsome Englishman  but Turenne foresaw his future greatness  He now gave the first proofs of his wisdom by advancing the subaltern officers  whose merit had hitherto been neglected  he gained the   92 enemy s posts without fighting  ever advancing  and never losing one advantage which he had gained  To this general was opposed  on the side of France  the Duke of Burgundy  grandson of the King  a youth more qualified to grace a court  than conduct an army  the Marshal Bouflers commanded under him  a man of courage and activity  But these qualities in both were forced to give way to the superior powers of their adversary  after having been forced to retire by the skilful marches of Marlborough  after having seen several towns taken  they gave up all hopes of acting offensively  and concluded the campaign with resolutions to prosecute the next with greater vigour   Marlborough  upon his return to London  received the rewards of his merit  being thanked by the house of commons  and created a Duke by the Queen  The success of one campaign ever spurs on the English to aim at new triumphs  Marlborough next season returned to the field  with larger authority  and greater confidence from his former success  He began the campaign by taking Bonne  the residence of the Elector of Cologne  he next retook Huys  Limbourg  and became master of all the Lower Rhine  The Marshal Villeroy  son to the King of France s governor  and educated with him  was now general of the French army  He was ever a favourite of Lewis  had shared his pleasures and his campaigns  He was brave  virtuous  and polite  but unequal to the great task of command  and still more so  when opposed to so great a rival   Marlborough  sensible of the abilities of his antagonist  was resolved
