that had she had no prepossession in favour of   du Plessis  or any engagement with him  the life of a nun was what she   never should have made choice of       She kept her sentiments on this occasion entirely to herself however    and made no shew of any repugnance to do as they would have her  but   whenever they became strenuous in their pressures  told them  she   doubted not but such a life as they described must be very angelic  but   having already disposed of her vows  it was not in her power to withdraw   them  nor would heaven accept so violated an offering  This  they told   her  was only a suggestion of some evil spirit  and that all engagements   to an earthly object  both might and ought to be dispensed with for a   divine vocation  The arguments they made use of for this purpose were   artful enough to have imposed on some minds  but Louisa had too much   penetration not to see thro  them  and being unwilling to disoblige them   by shewing that she did so  made use  in her turn  of evasions which the   circumstances of the case rendered very excusable  But fully persuaded   in their minds that it was solely her engagements with du Plessis that   rendered her so refractory to their desires  they resolved to break it   off  if possible  and to that end now intercepted his letters  two of   which giving an account that he was very much wounded and unable to   travel  they renewed their pressures  in order to prevail on her to take   the habit before he should be in a condition to come to Bolognia       These sollicitations  however  had no other effect than to embitter the   satisfaction she would otherwise have enjoyed during her stay among   them   the time of which began now to seem tedious  and she impatiently   longed for the end of the campaign  which she expected would return her   dear du Plessis to her  and she should be removed from a place where   dissimulation  a vice she detested  was in a manner necessary  She had   received several letters from him before the abbess took it in her head   to stop them  each more endearing than the former  and last had   flattered her with the hope of seeing him in a very short time       Days  weeks  and months passed over  after an assurance so pleasing to   her wishes  without any confirmation of the repeated vows he had made    and receiving from him no account of the reasons that delayed him  she   began to reproach herself for having placed too much confidence in   him   the more time elapsed  the more cause she had to doubt his   sincerity  and believe her misfortune real   in fine  it was near half a   year that she languished under a vain expectation of seeing  or at least   hearing from him   Sometimes she imagined a new object had deprived her   of his heart  but when she called to mind the many proofs he had given   her of the most unparallell d generosity that ever was she could not   think that if he even ceased to love her  he could be capable of leaving   her in so cruel a suspence   no  said she to herself  he would have let   me know I had no more to depend on from him   paper cannot blush  and as   he is out of the reach of my upbraidings  he would certainly have   acquainted me with my fate  confessed the inconstancy of his sex  and   exerted that wit  of which he has sufficient  to have excused his   change   I will not therefore injure a man whom I have found so truly   noble   death  perhaps  his deprived me of him  the unrelenting sword   makes no distinction between the worthy and unworthy   and the brave    the virtuous du Plessis  may have fallen a victim in common with the   most vulgar       These apprehensions had no sooner gained ground in her imagination  than   she became the most disconsolate creature in the world  The abbess took   advantage of her melancholy  as knowing the occasion of it  and began to   represent  in the strongest terms  the instability of all human   expectations   you may easily see  my dear child  said she  that   monsieur either no longer lives  or ceases to live for you   young men   are wavering  every new object attracts their wishes   they are   impatient for a time  but soon grow cool   absence renders them   forgetful of their vows and promises   there is no real dependance on   them   fly therefore to that divine love which never can
