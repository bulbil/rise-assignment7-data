  promise you  as to do enough to make them heartily weary of their   courtship to me  and at liberty to make their addresses elsewhere        After this  they fell into some conversation concerning the merits of   the two last mentioned gentlemen  They allowed Mr  Staple to have the   finest face  and that Mr  Trueworth was the best shaped  and had the   most graceful air in every thing he did  Mr  Staple had an infinity of   gaiety both in his look and behaviour  Mr  Trueworth had no less of   sweetness  and if his deportment seemed somewhat too serious for a man   of his years  it was well atoned for by the excellence of his   understanding  Miss Flora  however  said  upon the whole  that both of   them were charming men  and Lady Mellasin added  that it was a great   pity that either of them should have bestowed his heart where there was   so little likelihood of ever receiving any recompence   Why so  my   dear   cried Mr  Goodman   If my pretty charge is at present in a humour   to make as many fools as she can in this world  I hope she is not   determined to lead apes in another  I warrant she will change her mind   one time or other  I only wish she may not  as the old saying is    outstand her market        While they were thus discoursing  a servant brought a letter from Mr    Staple  directed to Miss Betsy Thoughtless  which was immediately   delivered to her  On being told from whence it came  she gave it to Mr    Goodman  saying   I shall make no secret of the contents  therefore    dear guardian  read it for the benefit of the company        Mr  Goodman shook his head at the little sensibility she testified of   his friend s devoirs  but said nothing  being willing to gratify the   curiosity he doubted not but they were all in  Miss Betsy herself not   excepted  as careless as she affected to be  which he did by reading  in   an audible voice  these lines             To the most amiable and most accomplished of her sex            Madam            If the face be the index of the mind   as I think one of our best        poets takes upon him to assert  your soul must certainly be all        made up of harmony  and consequently take delight in what has so        great a similitude of it s own heavenly nature  I flatter myself         therefore  you will not be offended that I presume to intreat you        will grace with your presence a piece of musick  composed by the so        justly celebrated Signior Bononcini  and  I hope  will have        justice done it in the performance  they being the best hands in        town that are employed            I do myself the honour to inclose tickets for the ladies of Mr         Goodman s family  and beg leave to wait on you this afternoon  in        the pleasing expectation  not only of being permitted to attend you        to the concert  but also of an opportunity of renewing those humble        and sincere professions I yesterday began to make of a passion         which only charms such as yours could have the power of inspiring        in any heart  and can be felt by none with greater warmth  zeal         tenderness  and respect  than by that of him who is  and ever must        be  Madam  your most passionate  and most faithful admirer            T  STAPLE            P S  If there are any other ladies of your acquaintance  to whom        you think the entertainment may be agreeable  be pleased to make        the invitation  I shall bring tickets with me to accommodate        whoever you chuse to accompany you  Once more  I beseech you         Madam  to believe me  as above  your   c        Mr  Goodman had scarce finished reading this letter  when
