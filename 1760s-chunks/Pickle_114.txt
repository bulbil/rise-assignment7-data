pleasure and  satisfaction  But no sooner did he regain possession of his stray sheep   than he locked her up more closely than ever  and after having revolved  various schemes for her reformation  determined to board her in  a convent  under the inspection of a prudent abbess  who should  superintend her morals  and recall her to the paths of virtue which  she had forsaken  With this view  he consulted an English priest of his    6 22 15  3 45 PM   acquaintance  who advised him to settle her in a monastery at Lisle   that she might be as far as possible from the machinations of her lover   and gave him a letter of recommendation to the superior of a certain  convent in that place  for which Mr  Hornbeck set out in a few days with  his troublesome charge   CHAPTER XLII   Peregrine resolves to return to England  Is diverted with the odd  Characters of two of his Countrymen  with whom he contracts an  acquaintance in the Apartments of the Palais Royal   In the mean time our hero received a letter from his aunt  importing  that the commodore was in a very declining way  and longed much to see  him at the garrison  and at the same time he heard from his sister  who  gave him to understand that the young gentleman  who had for some  time made his addresses to her  was become very pressing in his  solicitations  so that she wanted to know in what manner she should  answer his repeated entreaties  Those two considerations determined the  young gentleman to retain to his native country  a resolution that was  far from being disagreeable to Jolter  who knew that the incumbent on a  living which was in the gift of Trunnion was extremely old  and that  it would be his interest to be upon the spot at the said incumbent s  decease   Peregrine  who had resided about fifteen months in France  thought he  was now sufficiently qualified for eclipsing most of his contemporaries  in England  and therefore prepared for his departure with infinite  alacrity  being moreover inflamed with the most ardent desire of  revisiting his friends  and renewing his connections  particularly with  Emilia  whose heart he by this time  thought he was able to reduce on  his own terms   As he proposed to make the tour of Flanders and Holland in his return  to England  he resolved to stay at Paris a week or two after his affairs  were settled  in hope of finding some companion disposed for the same  journey  and  in order to refresh his memory  made a second circuit  round all the places in that capital  where any curious production of  art is to be seen  In the course of this second examination he chanced  to enter the Palais Royal  just as two gentlemen alighted from a fiacre  at the gate  and all three being admitted at the same time  he soon  perceived that the strangers were of his own country  One of them was a  young man  in whose air and countenance appeared all the uncouth  gravity and supercilious self conceit of a physician piping hot from his  studies  while the other  to whom his companion spoke by the appellation  of Mr  Pallet  displayed at first sight a strange composition of levity  and assurance  Indeed  their characters  dress  and address  were  strongly contrasted  the doctor wore a suit of black  and a huge  tie wig  neither suitable to his own age  nor the fashion of the country  where he then lived  whereas the other  though seemingly turned of  fifty  strutted in a gay summer dress of the Parisian cut  with a bag to  his own grey hair  and a red feather in his hat  which he carried under    6 22 15  3 45 PM   his arm  As these figures seemed to promise something entertaining   Pickle entered into conversation with them immediately  and soon  discovered that the old gentleman was a painter from London  who had  stolen a fortnight from his occupation  in order to visit the remarkable  paintings of France and Flanders  and that the doctor had taken the  opportunity of accompanying him in his tour  Being extremely talkative   he not only communicated these particulars to our hero in a very few  minutes after their meeting  but also took occasion to whisper in his  ear that his fellow traveller was a man of vast learning and  beyond  all doubt  the greatest poet of the age  As for himself  he was under no  necessity of making his own eulogium  for he soon gave such specimens of  his taste and talents as left Pickle no room to doubt of his capacity   While they stood considering the pictures in one of the first  apartments  which are by no means the most masterly compositions   the Swiss  who set up for a connoisseur  looking at a certain piece   pronounced the word with a note of admiration  upon which Mr  Pallet   who was not at all a critic in the French
