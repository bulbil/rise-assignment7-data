Sir Charles at the time acknowledged to his sisters  it had so very indifferent an appearance  for a young man to find fault with his governor  that  as well for the appearance sake  as for the man s  he was very loth to complain  till he became insupportable  It was mentioned  as it ought  greatly to the honour of the young gentleman s frankness and magnanimity  that when  at last  he found himself obliged to complain of this wicked man to his father  he gave him a copy of the letter he wrote  as soon as he sent it away  You may make  Sir  said he  what use you please of the slep I have taken  You see my charge  I have not aggravated it  Only  let me caution you  that  as I have not given you by my own misconduct any advantage over me  you do not make a still worse figure in my reply  if you give me occasion to justify my charge  My father loves his son  I must be his son  An altercation cannot end in your favour   But  on enquiry into the behaviour of this bad man  who might have tainted the morals of one of the finest youths on earth   which the son besought the father to make before he paid any regard to his complaints  Sir Thomas dismissed him  and made a compliment to his son  that he should have no other governor  for the future  than his own discretion   Miss Jervois s history is briefly this   She had one of the best of fathers  Her mother is one of the worst of women  A termagant  a swearer  a drinker  unchaste—Poor Mr  Jervois —I have told you  that he  a meek man  was obliged to abandon his country  to avoid her  Yet she wants to have her   240 daughter under her own tuition—Terrible —Sir Charles has had trouble with her  He expects to have more—Poor Miss Jervois   Miss Emily s fortune is very great  The Ladies say  Not less than 50 000 l  Her father was an Italian and Turky merchant  and Sir Charles  by his management  has augmented it to that sum  by the recovery of some thousands of pounds  which Mr  Jervois had thought desperate   AND thus have I brought down  as briefly as I was able  tho  writing almost night and day  and greatly indulged in the latter by the Ladies  who saw my heart was in the task   the history of this family  to the time when I had the happiness  by means  however  most shockingly undesirable  to be first acquainted with it   And now a word or two to present situations   Sir Charles is not yet come down  Lucy  And this is Monday —Very well —He has made excuses by his cousin Grandison  who came down with my cousin Reeves on Sunday morning  and both went up together yesterday—Vastly busy  no doubt —He will be here to morrow  I think  he says  His excuses were to his sisters and Lord L  I am glad he did not give himself the importance with your Harriet  to make any to her on his absence   Miss Grandison complains  that I open not my heart to her  She wants  she says  to open hers to me  but as she has intricacies that I cannot have  I must begin  She knows not how  she pretends  What her secrets may be  I presume not to guess  But surely I cannot tell a sister  who  with her sister  favours another woman  that I have a regard for her brother  and that before I can be sure he has any for me   She will play me a trick  she just now told me  if I will not let her know who the happy man in Northamptonshire   241 is  whom I prefer to all others  That there is such a one somewhere  she says  she has no doubt  And if she find it out  before I tell her  she will give me no quarter  speaking in the military phrase  which sometimes she is apt to do  Lady L  smiles  and eyes me with great attention  when her sister is raillying me  as if she  also  wanted to find out some reason for my refusing Lord D  I told them an hour ago  that I am beset with their eyes  and Lord L  s  for Lady L  keeps no one secret of her heart  nor  I believe  any body s else that she is mistress of  from her Lord  Him  I think  of all the men I know  my uncle not excepted  I could soonest intrust with a secret  But  have I  Lucy  any to reveal  It is  I hope  a secret to myself  that never will be unfolded  even to myself  that I love a man  who has not made professions of Love to me  As to Sir Charles Grandison—But have done  Harriet  Thou hast named a name  that will lead thee—Whither will it lead me —More than I am at
