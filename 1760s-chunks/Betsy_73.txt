all this time was very uneasy  he had not seen Miss Betsy for   a whole week  and  though he knew not as yet  that he was deprived of   that satisfaction  by her being engrossed by a rival  yet he now began   to be sensible she had less regard for him than he had flattered   himself he had inspired her with  and this of itself was a sufficient   mortification to a young gentleman  who was not only passionately in   love  but also could not  without being guilty of great injustice to his   own merits  but think himself not altogether unworthy of succeeding    This  however  was no more than a slight sample of the inquietudes which   the blind god sometimes inflicts on hearts devoted to him  as will   hereafter appear in the progress of this history                CHAPTER XX       Contains an odd accident  which happened to Miss Betsy in the cloysters   of Westminster Abbey          Mr  Trueworth  who was yet far from being acquainted with the temper of   the object he adored  now thought he had no reason to despair of being   one day in possession of all he aimed to obtain  it seemed certain  to   him  at least  that he had nothing to apprehend from the pretensions of   a rival  who at first he had looked upon as so formidable  and no other   at present interposed between him and his designs       Miss Betsy  in the mean while  wholly regardless of who hoped  or who   despaired  had no aim in any thing she did  but merely to divert   herself  and to that end laid hold of every opportunity that offered    Mr  Goodman  having casually mentioned  as they were at supper  that one   Mr  Soulguard had just taken orders  and was to preach his first sermon   at Westminster Abbey the next day  she presently had a curiosity of   hearing how he would behave in the pulpit  his over modest  and  as they   termed it  sheepish behaviour in company  having  as often as he came   there  afforded matter of ridicule to her and Miss Flora  These two   young ladies therefore  talking on it after they were in bed  agreed to   go to the cathedral  not doubting but they should have enough to laugh   at  and repeat to all those of their acquaintance who had ever seen him       What mere trifles  what airy nothings  serve to amuse a mind to not   taken up with more essential matters  Miss Betsy was so full of the   diversion she should have in hearing the down looked bashful Mr    Soulguard harangue his congregation  that she could think and talk of   nothing else  till the hour arrived when she should go to experience   what she had so pleasant an idea of       Miss Flora  who had till now seemed as eager as herself  cried all at   once  that her head ached  and that she did not care for stirring out    Miss Betsy  who would fain have laughed her out of it  told her  she had   only got the vapours  that the parson would cure her  and such like   things  but the other was not to be prevailed upon by all Miss Betsy  or   even Lady Mellasin herself  could say  and answered  with some   sullenness  that positively she would not go  Miss Betsy was highly   ruffled at this sudden turn of her temper  as it was now too late to   send for any other young lady of her acquaintance to go with her    resolving  nevertheless  not to baulk her humour  she ordered a chair to   be called  and went alone       Neither the young parson s manner of preaching  nor the text he chose    being in any way material to this history  I shall therefore pass over   the time of divine service  and only say  that after it was ended Miss   Betsy passing towards the west gate  and stopping to look on the fine   tomb  erected to the memory of Mr  Secretary Craggs  was accosted by Mr    Bloomacre  a young gentleman who sometimes visited Lady Mellasin  and   lived at Westminster  in which place he had a large estate       He had with him  when he came up to her  two gentlemen of his   acquaintance  but who were entire strangers to Miss Betsy   What   said   he   the celebrated Miss Betsy Thoughtless  Miss Betsy Thoughtless  the   idol of mankind  alone  unattended by any of her train of admirers  and   contemplating these mementos of mortality
