has lain quiet these five hours  and I do not chuse to disturb him  for sleep will do him great service  —   Ay   said my fellow mate  he sleeps so sound   look you  that he will never waken till the great trump plows —Got be merciful to his soul —He has paid his debt  like an honest man —Ay  and moreover  he is at rest from all persecutions  and troubles  and afflictions  of   303 which  Got knows  and I know  he had his own share —Ochree  Ochree  he was a promising youth indeed  —  So saying  he groaned grievously  and began to whine in such a manner  as persuaded me he had a real friendship for me —The serjeant  alarmed at his words  came into the birth  and while he looked upon me  I smiled  and tipt him the wink  he immediately guessed my meaning  and remained silent  which confirmed Morgan in his opinion of my being dead  whereupon he approached with tears in his eyes  in order to indulge his grief with a sight of the object  And I counterfeited death so well  by fixing my eyes  and droping my under jaw  that he said    There he lies  no petter than a lump of clay  Got help me    And observed by the distortion of my face  that I must have had a strong struggle  I should not have been able to contain myself much longer  when he began to perform the last duty of a friend  in closing my eyes and my mouth  upon which  I suddenly snapped at his fingers  and discomposed him so much  that he started back  turned pale as ashes  and stared like the picture of horror  Although I could not help laughing at his appearance  I was concerned for his situation  and stretched out my hand  telling him  I hoped to live and eat some salmagundy of his making in England —It was some time before he could recollect himself so far as to feel my pulse  and enquire into the particulars of my disease  But when he found I had enjoyed a favourable crisis  he congratulated me upon my good fortune  not failing to ascribe it  under Got  to the blister he had applied to my back  at his last visit  which  by the bye  said   304 he  must now be removed and dressed  He was actually going to fetch dressings  when I feigning astonishment  said    Bless me  sure you never applied a blister to me—there is nothing on my back  I assure you  —  Of this he could not be convinced till he had examined  and then endeavoured to conceal his confusion  by expressing his surprize in finding the skin untouched  and the plaister missing —In order to excuse myself for paying so little regard to his prescription  I pretended to have been insensible when it was put on  and to have pulled it off afterwards  in a fit of delirium  This apology satisfied my friend  who on this occasion abated a good deal of his stiffness in regard to punctilios  and as we were now safely arrived at Jamaica  where I had the benefit of fresh provision  and other refreshments  I recovered strength every day  and in a short time  my health and vigour were perfectly re established —When I got up at first  and was just able to crawl about the deck  with a staff in my hand  I met doctor Mackshane  who passed by me with a disdainful look  and did not vouchsafe to honour me with one word  After him came Crampley  who strutting up to me  with a fierce countenance  pronounced    Here s fine discipline on board  when such lazy sculking sons of b—ches as you  are allowed  on pretence of sickness  to lollop at your ease  while your betters are kept to hard duty  —  The sight and behaviour of this malicious scoundrel  enraged me so much  that I could scarce refrain from laying my cudgel across his pate  but when I considered my present feebleness  and the enemies I had in the ship  who wanted only   305 a pretence to ruin me  I restrained my passion  and contented myself with telling him  I had not forgot his insolence and malice  and that I hoped we should meet one day on shore —At this he grinned  shook his fist at me  and swore he longed for nothing more than such an opportunity     Mean while  our ship was ordered to be heaved down  victualled and watered  for her return to England  and our captain  for some reason or other  not thinking it convenient for him to revisit his native country at this time  exchanged with a gentleman  who on the other hand  wished for nothing so much  as to be safe without the tropick  all his care and tenderness of himself  being insufficient to preserve his complexion from the injuries of the sun and weather   Our tyrant having left the ship  and carried his favourite Mackshane along with him  to my inexpressible satisfaction  our new commander came on board  in a ten oar
