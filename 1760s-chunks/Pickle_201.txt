for  the intrigue   Encouraged by this suggestion  he complied with the dictates of love   and flew to the place where his charmer sat  His air and dress were so  remarkable  that it was almost impossible he should have escaped the  eyes of a curious observer  especially as he had chosen a time for  coming in  when his entrance could not fail to attract the notice of the  spectators  I mean  when the whole house was hushed in attention to the    6 22 15  3 45 PM   performance on the stage  Emilia  therefore  perceived him at his first  approach  she found herself discovered by the direction of his glass   and  guessing his intention by his abrupt retreat from the box  summoned  all her fortitude to her aid  and prepared for his reception  He  advanced to her with an air of eagerness and joy  tempered with modesty  and respect  and expressed his satisfaction at seeing her  with a  seeming reverence of regard  Though she was extremely well pleased at  this unexpected behaviour  she suppressed the emotions of her heart  and  answered his compliments with affected ease and unconcern  such as  might denote the good humour of a person who meets by accident with an  indifferent acquaintance  After having certified himself of her own good  health  he very kindly inquired about her mother and Miss Sophy  gave  her to understand that he had lately been favoured with a letter from  Godfrey  that he had actually intended to set out next morning on a  visit to Mrs  Gauntlet  which  now that he was so happy as to meet with  her  he would postpone  until he should have the pleasure of attending  her to the country  After having thanked him for his polite intention   she told him  that her mother was expected in town in a few days  and  that she herself had come to London some weeks ago  to give attendance  upon her aunt  who had been dangerously ill  but was now pretty well  recovered   Although the conversation of course turned upon general topics  during  the entertainment he took all opportunities of being particular with his  eyes  through which he conveyed a thousand tender protestations  She  saw and inwardly rejoiced at the humility of his looks  but  far from  rewarding it with one approving glance  she industriously avoided this  ocular intercourse  and rather coquetted with a young gentleman that  ogled her from the opposite box  Peregrine s penetration easily detected  her sentiments  and he was nettled at her dissimulation  which served to  confirm him in his unwarrantable designs upon her person  He persisted  in his assiduities with indefatigable perseverance  when the play was  concluded  handed her and her companion into a hackney coach  and with  difficulty was permitted to escort them to the house of Emilia s uncle   to whom our hero was introduced by the young lady  as an intimate friend  of her brother Godfrey   The old gentleman  who was no stranger to the nature of Peregrine s  connection with his sister s family  prevailed upon him to stay  supper  and seemed particularly well pleased with his conversation and  deportment  which  by the help of his natural sagacity  he wonderfully  adapted to the humour of his entertainer  After supper  when the ladies  were withdrawn  and the citizen called for his pipe  our sly adventurer  followed his example  Though he abhorred the plant  he smoked with  an air of infinite satisfaction  and expatiated upon the virtues of  tobacco  as if he had been deeply concerned in the Virginia trade  In  the progress of the discourse  he consulted the merchant s disposition   and the national debt coming upon the carpet  held forth upon the  funds like a professed broker  When the alderman complained of the  restrictions and discouragements of trade  his guest inveighed against  exorbitant duties  with the nature of which he seemed as well acquainted  as any commissioner of the customs  so that the uncle was astonished at  the extent of his knowledge  and expressed his surprise that a gay young  gentleman like him should have found either leisure or inclination to  consider subjects so foreign to the fashionable amusements of youth   Pickle laid hold on this opportunity to tell him  that he was descended    6 22 15  3 45 PM   from a race of merchants  and that  early in life  he had made it his  business to instruct himself in the different branches of trade  which  he not only studied as his family profession  but also as the source  of all our national riches and power  He then launched out in praise of  commerce  and the promoters thereof  and  by way of contrast  employed  all his ridicule in drawing such ludicrous pictures of the manners and  education of what is called high life  that the trader s sides were  shaken by laughter  even to the danger of his life  and he looked upon  our adventurer as a miracle of sobriety and good sense  Having thus
