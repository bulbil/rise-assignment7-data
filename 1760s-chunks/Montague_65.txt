night  my Lucy  I love you beyond all expression  I always loved you tenderly  but there is a softness about my heart to night this lovely woman       I know not what I would say  but till this night I could never be said to live       Adieu  Your affectionate  ED  RIVERS     LETTER CIV   104   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   Quebec  28th March   I HAD this morning a short billet from her dear hand  entreating me to make up a quarrel between Bell Fermor and her lover  your friend has been indiscreet  her spirit of coquetry is eternally carrying her wrong  but in my opinion Fitzgerald has been at least equally to blame       His behaviour at the governor s on Thursday night was inexcusable  as it exposed her to the sneers of a whole circle of her own sex  many of them jealous of her perfections       A lover should overlook little caprices  where the heart is good and amiable like Bell s  I should think myself particularly obliged to bring this affair to an amicable conclusion  even if Emily had not desired it  as I was originally the innocent cause of their quarrel  In my opinion he ought to beg her pardon  and  as a friend tenderly interested for both  I have a right to tell him I think so  he loves her  and I know must suffer greatly  though a foolish pride prevents his acknowledging it       My greatest fear is  that an idle resentment may engage him in an intrigue with the lady in question  who is a woman of gallantry  and whom he may find very troublesome hereafter  It is much easier to commence an affair of this kind than to break it off  and a man  though his heart was disengaged  should be always on his guard against any thing like an attachment where his affections are not really interested  meer passion or meer vanity will support an affair en passant  but  where the least degree of constancy and attention are expected  the heart must feel  or the lover is subjecting himself to a slavery as irksome as a marriage without inclination       Temple will tell you I speak like an oracle  for I have often seen him led by vanity into this very disagreable situation  I hope I am not too late to save Fitzgerald from it    Six in the evening       All goes well  his proud heart is come down  he has begged her pardon  and is forgiven  you have no idea how civil both are to me  for having persuaded them to do what each of them has longed to do from the first moment  I love to advise  when I am sure the heart of the person advised is on my side  Both were to blame  but I always love to save the ladies from any thing mortifying to the dignity of their characters  a little pride in love becomes them  but not us  and  tis always our part to submit on these occasions       I never saw two happier people than they are at present  as I have a little preserved decorum on both sides  and taken the whole trouble of the reconciliation on myself  Bell knows nothing of my having applied to Fitzgerald  nor he that I did it at Emily s request  my conversation with him on this subject seemed accidental  I was obliged to leave them  having business in town  but my lovely Emily thanked me by a smile which would overpay a thousand such little services       I am to spend to morrow at Silleri  how long shall I think this evening       Adieu  my tenderest wishes attend you all   Your affectionate  ED  RIVERS     LETTER CV   105   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   Silleri  March 27  evening   FITZGERALD has been here  and has begged my pardon  he declares he had no thought of displeasing me at the governor s  but from my behaviour was afraid of importuning me if he addressed me as usual       I thought who would come to first  for my part  if he had stayed away for ever  I would not have suffered papa to invite him to Silleri  it was easy to see his neglect was all pique  it would have been extraordinary indeed if such a woman as Madame La Brosse could have rivalled me  I am something younger  and  if either my glass or the men are to be believed  as handsome  entre nous  there is some little difference  if she was not so very fair  she would be absolutely ugly  and these very fair women  you know  Lucy  are always insipid  she is the taste of no man breathing  though eternally making advances to every man  without spirit  fire  understanding  vivacity  or any quality capable of making amends for the mediocrity of her charms       Her insolence in attempting to attach Fitzgerald is intolerable  especially when the whole province knows him to be my lover  there is no expressing to what a degree I hate her       The next time we meet I
