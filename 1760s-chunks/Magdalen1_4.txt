 forbids me to entertain any thoughts of settling with her for life—I could by no means bear the imputation of imaginary infidelity in my wife  and Caesar himself could not be more delicate in this respect  when he said That it was not enough for his wife to be virtuous  she must be unsuspected also   When I look back upon the unconscionable length of this letter—I wonder how I found inclination to write so much  if  however  you find inclination to read it  I shall not think my time misapplied  since I am  dear Melmoth   Your s very faithfully  ROBERT HAROLD     18  LETTER II  Sir ROBERT HAROLD  in Continuation to CHARLES MELMOTH  Esq    PURSUANT to the intention which I had intimated of calling in upon my sister Haversham before dinner  I took but a turn or two round the rooms  and then went back to her house  where I had the good fortune of finding her alone  a circumstance which afforded me a proper opportunity of making the necessary enquiries after Louisa  As you know my sister is a woman of great sentiment and delicacy  I was obliged to begin in a roundabout manner  and therefore carelessly observed that we had a very agreeable party the preceding evening     Why Bob  says she I should scarcely suppose that to be your real   19 opinion  by the hurry in which you took leave of the company—But pray what was the actual reason   and here she looked with a peculiar significance of feature   that robbed us so early of a man devoted to the service of the ladies—I was in hopes your complaisance to them would have detained you a little longer  if you were influenced by no regard for me—But I can guess—I know that consummate vanity of your s too well not to think you were laying out some fresh baits for the foolish women who honoured you with so peculiar a distinction—You wanted to give them an opportunity of talking about you after you were gone  and are now come to hear the whole substance of their conversation  from a sister  who can keep nothing a secret from you  notwithstanding she is acquainted   20 with the licentious turn of your disposition  and heartily laments it      My dear lady Haversham   returned I    how can you possibly treat me with so much severity —Business of the most pressing nature forced me from you last night  and this morning  to convince you  that nothing but the result of a brotherly affection induced me to call—      Ah  Bob  Bob   interrupted she    don t I know you —Or  if I did not—the design is too palpable to elude the eye of a common penetration —But  be that as it may  what do you think of Louisa Mildmay      Think of her lady Haversham —    Ay  think of her lady Haversham—Come  come  I saw  under all that   21 gallantry which you threw away on the other ladies last night  that your design was in a great measure to pique her—Had she been wholly indifferent to you  you would have treated her with common civility—But I saw  and I saw with pleasure  that at the very first sight she made an impression  which I hope in a little time will be attended with the most salutary consequences —The truth is  my dear Bob  I can never be happy while you remain unmarried—the continual excesses into which you are hurried by an unfortunate spirit of gallantry  fill me with a perpetual regret  you know I love you with a tenderness  perhaps  as great as ever sister felt for a brother—and am doubly sensible of all your accomplishments —It therefore cuts me to the soul when I see a young fellow of your merit prostituting those talents in the   22 destruction  as well as of his own happiness  as the happiness of other people—which might be rendered equally creditable to himself and advantageous to society —On this account  I have been  for some time  looking out for a woman whose beauty might be able to secure your affection—whose merit might be able to engage your esteem  and whose family might be able to give you an encrease of consequence in your country —These very desirable requisites I find will be all answered in a union with Louisa Mildmay—What say you then  my dear Bob—can you  for once  turn that fine sense of which I know you master  to the certain means of establishing your real happiness  or will you still persist  in opposition both to your reason and your humanity  to prosecute such courses as you cannot view without   23 contempt  nor consider without detestation       Upon my word lady Haversham   replied I  you would make an admirable  — Come  come  Bob   returned she   don t endeavour to ridicule an argument which you are unable to answer  nor  by an untimely affectation of wit  attempt to lessen the credit of your own understanding —Answer me therefore directly to the question—What do you think of Miss Mildmay     I do not know how it was  Melmoth  but the good sense  and unaffected tenderness  of this amiable sister
