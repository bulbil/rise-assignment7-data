representation of the case  would have punished them severely for    6 22 15  3 45 PM   their rapacious and insolent behaviour  Peregrine  without further  molestation  availed himself of his own attendants  who shouldered his  baggage and followed him to the gate  where they were stopped by the  sentinels until their names should be registered   Mr  Jolter  who had undergone this examination before  resolved to  profit by his experience  and cunningly represented his pupil as a  young English lord  This intimation  supported by the appearance of his  equipage  was no sooner communicated to the officer  than he turned out  the guard  and ordered his soldiers to rest upon their arms  while his  lordship passed in great state to the Lion d Argent  where he took up  his lodging for the night  resolving to set out for Paris next morning  in a post chaise   The governor triumphed greatly in this piece of complaisance and respect  with which they had been honoured  and resumed his beloved topic of  discourse  in applauding the method and subordination of the French  government  which was better calculated for maintaining order and  protecting the people  than any constitution upon earth  Of their  courteous attention to strangers  there needed no other proof than the  compliment which had been paid to them  together with the governor s  connivance at Peregrine s employing his own servants in carrying the  baggage to the inn  contrary to the privilege of the inhabitants   While he expatiated with a remarkable degree of self indulgence on  this subject  the valet de chambre coming into the room interrupted his  harangue by telling his master that their trunks and portmanteaus must  be carried to the custom house  in order to be searched  and sealed with  lead  which must remain untouched until their arrival at Paris   Peregrine made no objection to this practice  which was in itself  reasonable enough  but when he understood that the gate was besieged by  another multitude of porters  who insisted upon their right of carrying  the goods  and also of fixing their own price  he absolutely refused to  comply with their demand  Nay  he chastised some of the most clamorous  among them with his foot  and told them  that if their custom house  officers had a mind to examine his baggage  they might come to the inn  for that purpose  The valet de chambre was abashed at this boldness of  his master s behaviour  which the lacquey  shrugging up his shoulders   observed  was bien a l Anglaise  while the governor represented it as an  indignity to the whole nation  and endeavoured to persuade his pupil to  comply with the custom of the place  But Peregrine s natural haughtiness  of disposition hindered him from giving ear to Jolter s wholesome  advice  and in less than half an hour they observed a file of musketeers  marching up to the gate  At sight of this detachment the tutor trembled   the valet grew pale  and the lacquey crossed himself  but our hero   without exhibiting any other symptoms than those of indignation  met  them on the threshold  and with a ferocious air demanded their business   The corporal who commanded the file answered  with great deliberation   that he had orders to convey his baggage to the custom house  and seeing  the trunks standing in the entry  placed his men between them and the  owner  while the porters that followed took them up  and proceeded to  the douane without opposition   Pickle was not mad enough to dispute the authority of this message  but  in order to gall and specify his contempt for those who brought it  he  called aloud to his valet  desiring him  in French  to accompany his    6 22 15  3 45 PM   things  and see that none of his linen and effects should be stolen by  the searchers  The corporal  mortified at this satirical insinuation   darted a look of resentment at the author  as if he had been interested  for the glory of his nation  and told him that he could perceive he was  a stranger in France  or else he would have saved himself the trouble of  such a needless precaution   CHAPTER XXXVI   He makes a fruitless Attempt in Gallantry  Departs for Boulogne  where  he spends the evening with certain English Exiles   Having thus yielded to the hand of power  he inquired if there was any  other English company in the house  when  understanding that a gentleman  and lady lodged in the next apartment  and had bespoke a post chaise for  Paris  he ordered Pipes to ingratiate himself with their footman  and   if possible  learn their names and condition  while he and Mr  Jolter   attended by the lacquey  took a turn round the ramparts  and viewed the  particulars of the fortification   Tom was so very successful in his inquiry  that when his master  returned he was able to give him a very satisfactory account of his  fellow lodgers  in consequence of having treated his brother
