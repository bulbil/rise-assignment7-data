I shall never question your prudence  And we   will  so long as God spares our lives  go down  once a year  to see   them  and they shall come up  as often as they please  it cannot be   too often  to see us  for I mean not this  my dear  to send them from   us   Before I proceed  does my Pamela like this       O  sir  said I  the English tongue affords not words  or  at least  I   have them not  to express sufficiently my gratitude  Teach me  dear sir    continued I  and pressed his dear hand to my lips  teach me some other   language  if there be any  that abounds with more grateful terms  that I   may not thus be choked with meanings  for which I can find no utterance       My charmer  says he  your language is all wonderful  as your sentiments    and you most abound  when you seem most to want   All that I wish  is to   find my proposals agreeable to you  and if my first are not  my second   shall be  if I can but know what you wish       Did I say too much  my dearest parents  when I said  He was  if   possible  kinder and kinder   O the blessed man  how my heart is   overwhelmed with his goodness       Well  said he  my dearest  let me desire you to mention this to them  to   see if they approve it  But  if it be your choice  and theirs  to have   them nearer to you  or even under the same roof with you  I will freely   consent to it       O no  sir  said I   and I fear almost sinned in my grateful flight   I   am sure they would not choose that  they could not  perhaps  serve God   so well if they were to live with you  For  so constantly seeing the   hand that blesses them  they would  it may be  as must be my care to   avoid  be tempted to look no further in their gratitude  than to the   dear dispenser of such innumerable benefits       Excellent creature  said he  My beloved wants no language  nor   sentiments neither  and her charming thoughts  so sweetly expressed    would grace any language  and this is a blessing almost peculiar to   my fairest   Your so kind acceptance  my Pamela  added he  repays the   benefit with interest  and leaves me under obligation to your goodness       But now  my dearest  I will tell you what we will do  with regard to   points of your own private charity  for far be it from me  to put under   that name the subject we have been mentioning  because that  and more   than that  is duty to persons so worthy  and so nearly related to my   Pamela  and  as such  to myself   O how the sweet man outdoes me  in   thoughts  words  power  and every thing       And this  said he  lies in very small compass  for I will allow you two   hundred pounds a year  which Longman shall constantly pay you  at fifty   pounds a quarter  for your own use  and of which I expect no account    to commence from the day you enter into my other house  I mean  said he    that the first fifty pounds shall then be due  because you shall have   something to begin with  And  added the dear generous man  if this be   pleasing to you  let it  since you say you want words  be signified by   such a sweet kiss as you gave me yesterday  I hesitated not a moment to   comply with these obliging terms  and threw my arms about his dear neck    though in the chariot  and blessed his goodness to me  But  indeed  sir    said I  I cannot bear this generous treatment  He was pleased to say    Don t be uneasy  my dear  about these trifles  God has blessed me with a   very good estate  and all of it in a prosperous condition  and generally   well tenanted  I lay up money every year  and have  besides  large sums   in government and other securities  so that you will find  what I have   hitherto promised  is very short of that proportion of my substance    which  as my dearest wife  you have a right to       In this sweet manner did we pass our time till evening  when
