state then cannot subsist without them  they must then be introduced  at once to teach men to draw the greatest possible quantity of pleasure from circumscribed possession  and to restrain them within the bounds of moderate enjoyment   The sciences are not the cause of luxury  but its consequence  and this destroyer thus brings with it an antidote which resists the virulence of its own poison  By asserting that luxury introduces the sciences  we assert a truth  but if with those  who reject the utility of learning▪ we   77 assert that the sciences also introduce luxury  we shall be at once false  absurd  and ridiculous   Adieu   LETTER LXXX  From Lien Chi Altangi to Hingpo  by the way of Moscow   YOU are now arrived at an age  my son  when pleasure dissuades from application  but rob not by present gratification all the succeeding period of life of its happiness Sacrifice a little pleasure at first to the expectance of greater  The study of a very few years will make the rest of life compleatly easy   But instead of continuing the subject myself  take the following instructions borrowed from a modern philosopher of China    He who has begun his fortune by study will certainly confirm it by perseverance  The love of books damps the passion for pleasure  and when this passion is once extinguished  life is then cheaply supported  thus a man being possessed of more than he wants  can never be subject to great disappointments  and avoids all those meannesses which indigence sometimes unavoidably produces    There is unspeakable pleasure attending the life of a voluntary student  The first time I read   78 an excellent book  it is to me just as if I had gained a new friend  When I read over a book I have perused before  it resembles the meeting with an old one  We ought to lay hold of every incident in life for improvement  the trifling as well as the important  It is not one diamond alone which gives lustre to another  a common coarse stone is also employed for that purpose  Thus I ought to draw advantage from the insults and contempt I meet with from a worthless fellow  His brutality ought to induce me to self examination  and correct every blemish that may have given rise to his calumny    Yet with all the pleasures and profits which are generally produced by learning  parents often find it difficult to induce their children to study  They often seem dragged to what wears the appearance of application  Thus being dilatory in the beginning  all future hopes of eminence are entirely cut off  If they find themselves obliged to write two lines more polite than ordinary  their pencil then seems as heavy as a mill stone  and they spend ten years in turning two or three periods with propriety    These persons are most at a loss when a banquet is almost over  the plate and the dice go round  that the number of little verses which each is obliged to repeat may be determined by chance  The booby  when it comes to his turn  appears quite stupid and insensible  The company divert themselves with his confusion  and sneers  winks  and whispers are circulated at his expence  As for him  he opens a pair of large heavy eyes  stares at all about him  and even offers to join in the laugh    79 without ever considering himself as the burthen of all their good humour    But it is of no importance to read much  except you be regular in your reading  If it be interrupted for any considerable time  it can never be attended with proper improvement  There are some who study for one day with intense application  and repose themselves for ten days after  But wisdom is a coquet  and must be courted with unabating assiduity    It was a saying of the ancients  that a man never opens a book without reaping some advantage by it  I say with them  that every book can serve to make us more expert  except romances  and these are no better than instruments of debauchery  They are dangerous fictions  where love is the ruling passion    The most indecent strokes there pass for turns of wit  intrigue and criminal liberties for gallantry and politeness  Assignations  and even villainy  are put in such strong lights  as may inspire  even grown men  with the strongest passion  how much more therefore ought the youth of either sex to dread them  whose reason is so weak  and whose hearts are so susceptible of passion    To slip in by a back door  or leap a wall  are accomplishments that when handsomely set off enchant a young heart  It is true the plot is commonly wound up by a marriage  concluded with the consent of parents  and adjusted by every ceremony prescribed by law  But as in the body of the work there are many passages that offend good   80 morals  overthrow laudable customs  violate the laws  and destroy the duties most essential to society  virtue is thereby exposed to the most dangerous attacks    But  say some  the authors of these romances have nothing in view  but to represent vice punished and virtue rewarded  Granted
