a smile  you will have no need of me  you bring  I perceive    recommendations more effectual  and have besides  in yourself    sufficient to engage all you have to wish from a monarch so just and   generous as ours       Horatio replied to this compliment with all humility  and as the count   perceived by his accents that he was not a Frenchman  tho  he spoke the   language perfectly well  he asked him of what country he was  to which   Horatio replied  that he was of England  but made him no farther   acquainted with his affairs  nor that the motive of his having remained   so long in France  was because he was not ransomed by his friends  not   that he concealed this out of pride  but he knew the character of most   first ministers  and thought it not prudence to unbosom himself to one   of those  whose first study  when they come into that employment  is to   discover as much as they can of others  without revealing any thing of   themselves  For this reason he was also very sparing of entering into   any discourse of the chevalier s court  or of that of the king of   France  and answered all the questions put to him by the count  that his   youth  and being of foreign extraction  hindered him from being let into   any secrets of state       After a pretty long conversation  the count led him to the king of   Sweden s apartment  where  just as they were about to enter  he asked   him if he could speak Latin  for  said he  tho  his majesty understands   French  he never could be brought to speak it  nor is pleased to be   addressed in that language  Horatio thanked him for this information    and told him  that tho  he could not boast of being able to deliver   himself with an affluence becoming the presence of so great a prince    yet he would chuse rather to shew his bad learning  than his want of   ambition to do every thing that might render himself acceptable       As he spoke these words  he found himself in his presence   The king was   encompassed by the officers of the army  to whom he was giving some   directions  but seeing count Piper  and a stranger with him  he left off   what he was saying  and  without giving him time to speak  cried  Count    who have you brought me here  One  may it please your majesty  replied   he  who brings his credentials with him  and has no need of my   intercession to engage his welcome  While the count Was making this   reply  the king  who had an uncommon quickness in his eyes  measured   Horatio from head to foot  and our young soldier of fortune  without   being daunted  put one knee to the ground  and delivered his packet with   these words   The princes  by whom I have the honour to be sent    commanded me to assure your majesty  that they participate in all your   dangers  rejoice in all your glories  and pray  that as you only conquer   for the good of others  the sword you draw  in the cause of justice  may   at last be sheathed in a lasting and universal peace       I am afraid it will be long before all that is necessary for that   purpose is accomplished  said the king  wrong  when established  not   easily gives place to right   but we are yet young enough to hope it       He broke open his letters as he spoke this  and while he was examining   them  took his eye off the paper several times to look on Horatio  and   then read again       When he had done  I am much obliged  said he  to the zeal these letters   tell me you have expressed for my service  and shall not be   ungrateful   we are here idle at present but shall not long be so  and   you will have occasions enough to prove your courage  and gratify that   love of arms which  my brother informs me  is the predominant passion of   your soul       After this he asked him several questions concerning the chevalier St    George  the queen  and princess Louisa  to which Horatio answered with   great propriety  but mingled with such encomiums of the royal persons    as testified his gratitude for the favours he received from them  But   when he mentioned the princess  and delivered the message she sent by   him  a more lively colour flushed into the king s cheeks  and he   replied  well  we shall do
