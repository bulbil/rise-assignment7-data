two bundles of hay  incapable of determining where they should first offer their attendance   Our knight s patience was almost exhausted  when Crabshaw entered the room  in a very strange equipage  One half of his face appeared close shaved  and the other covered with lather  while the blood trickled in two rivulets from his nose  upon a barber s cloth that was tucked under his chin  he looked grim with indignation  and under his left arm carried his cutlass  unsheathed  Where he had acquired so much of the profession of knight errantry we shall not pretend to determine  but certain it is  he fell on his knees before Sir Launcelot  crying  with an accent of grief and distraction   In the name of St  George for England  I beg a boon  Sir Knight  and thy compliance I demand  before the peacock and the ladies    Sir Launcelot  astonished at this address  replied in a lofty strain   Valiant squire  thy boon is granted  provided it doth not contravene the laws of the land  and the constitution of chivalry    Then I crave leave   answered Crabshaw   to challenge and defy to mortal combat that caitiff barber who hath left me in this piteous condition  and I vow by the peacock  that I will not shave my beard  until I have shaved his head from his shoulders  So may I thrive in the occupation of an arrant squire    Before his master had time to inquire into particulars  they were joined by a decent man in boots  who was likewise a traveller  and had seen the rise and progress of Timothy s disaster  He gave the knight to understand  that Crabshaw had sent for a barber  and already undergone one half of the operation  when the operator received the long expected message from both the gentlemen who stood candidates at the election  The double summons was no sooner intimated to him  than he threw down his bason  and retired with precipitation  leaving the squire in the suds  Timothy  incensed at this desertion  followed him with equal celerity into the street  where he collared the shaver  and insisted upon being entirely trimmed  on pain of the bastinado  The other finding himself thus arrested  and having no time to spare for altercation  lifted up his fist  and discharged it upon the snout of Crabshaw with such force  that the unfortunate aggressor was fain to bite the ground  while the victor hastened away  in hope of touching the double wages of corruption   The knight being informed of these circumstances  told Timothy with a smile  that he should have liberty to defy the barber  but  in the meantime  he ordered him to saddle Bronzomarte  and prepare for immediate service  While the squire was thus employed  his master engaged in conversation with the stranger  who happened to be a London dealer travelling for orders  and was well acquainted with the particulars which our adventurer wanted to know   It was from this communicative tradesman he learned  that the competitors were Sir Valentine Quickset and Mr  Isaac Vanderpelft  the first a mere fox hunter  who depended for success in his election upon his interest among the high flying gentry  the other a stock jobber and contractor of foreign extract  not without a mixture of Hebrew blood  immensely rich  who was countenanced by his Grace of——  and supposed to have distributed large sums in securing a majority of votes among the yeomanry of the county  possessed of small freeholds  and copyholders  a great number of which last resided in this borough  He said these were generally dissenters and weavers  and that the mayor  who was himself a manufacturer  had received a very considerable order for exportation  in consequence of which it was believed he would support Mr  Vanderpelft with all his influence and credit   Sir Launcelot  roused at this intelligence  called for his armour  which being buckled on in a hurry  he mounted his steed  attended by Crabshaw on Gilbert  and rode immediately into the midst of the multitude by which the hustings were surrounded  just as Sir Valentine Quickset began to harangue the people from an occasional theatre  formed of a plank supported by the upper board of the public stocks  and an inferior rib of a wooden cage pitched also for the accommodation of petty delinquents   Though the singular appearance of Sir Launcelot at first attracted the eyes of all the spectators  yet they did not fail to yield attention to the speech of his brother knight  Sir Valentine  which ran in the following strain — Gentlemen vreeholders of this here county  I shan t pretend to meake a vine flourishing speech—I m a plain spoken man  as you all know  I hope I shall always speak my maind without vear or vavour  as the zaying is   T is the way of the Quicksets—we are no upstarts  nor vorreigners  nor have we any Jewish blood in our veins  we have lived in this here neighbourhood time out of mind  as you all know  and possess an estate of vive thousand clear  which we spend at whoam  among you  in old English hospitality  All my vorevathers have been parliament men  and I can prove that ne er a
