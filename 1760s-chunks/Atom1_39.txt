of it could be atchieved at a very trifling expence  He did more  Tho  by the maxims of his sect he was restrained from engaging in any military enterprize  he offered to conduct the armament in person  in order the more effectually to keep    219 the king of the country steady to his engagements  Though the scheme was in itself plausible and practicable  Mr  orator Taycho shuffled and equivocated until the season for action was past  But Thum Khumm qua was indefatigable  He exhorted  he pressed  he remonstrated  he complained  and besieged the orator s house in such a manner  that Taycho at length  in order to be rid of his importunity  granted his request  A small armament was fitted out  the Banyan embarked in it  leaving his own private affairs in confusion  and the settlement was reduced according to his prediction  When the news of this conquest arrived at Meaco  the multifarious beast brayed hoarse applause  and the minister Taycho was magnified exceedingly  As for Thum Khumm qua  whose private fortune was consumed in the expedition  all    220 the recompence he received  was the consciousness of having served his country  In vain he reminded Taycho of his promises  in vain he recited the minister s own letters  in which he had given his word that the Banyan should be liberally rewarded  according to the importance of his services  Taycho was both deaf and blind to all his remonstrances and representations  and  at last  fairly flung the door in his face   Such was the candour and the gratitude of the incomparable Taycho —The poor projector Thum Khumm qua found himself in a piteous case  while the whole nation resounded with joy for the conquest which his sagacity had planned  and his zeal carried into execution  He was not only abandoned by the minister Taycho  but also renounced by the whole sect of the Banyans  who looked upon him as a wicked apostate     221 because he had been concerned with those who fought with the arm of flesh  It was lucky for him that he afterwards found favour with a subsequent minister  who had not adopted all the maxims of his predecessor Taycho —The only measures which this egregious demagogue could hitherto properly call his own  were these  His subsidiary treaty with Brut an tiffi  his raising an immense army of mercenaries to act in Tartary for the benefit of that prince  his exacting an incredible sum of money from the people of Japan  and finally  two successive armaments which he had sent to annoy the sea coast of China  I have already given an account of the first  the intent of which was frustrated by a mistake in the perspectives  The other was more fortunate in the beginning  Taycho had by the force of his genius  discovered that    222 nothing so effectually destroyed the oiled paper which the Chinese use in their windows instead of glass  as the gold coin called Oban  when discharged from a military engine at a proper distance  He found that gold was more compact  more heavy  more malleable  and more manageable than any other metal or substance that he knew  he therefore provided a great quantity of obans  and a good body of •lingers  and these being conveyed to the coast of China  in a squadron of Fune  as none of the Chinese appeared to oppose these hostilities  a select number of the troops were employed to make ducks and drakes with the obans  on the supposition that this diversion would allure the enemy to the sea side  where they might be knocked on the head without further trouble  but the care of their own safety got the better of their curiosity on this occasion  and    223 fifty thousand obans were expended in this manner  without bringing one Chinese from his lurking hole  Considerable damage was done to the windows of the enemy  Then the forces were landed in a village which they found deserted  Here they burned some fishing boats  and from hence they carried off some military machines  which were brought to Meaco  and conveyed through the streets in procession  amidst the acclamations of the Hydra  who sung the praise of Taycho —Elevated by this triumph  the minister sent forth the same armament a second time under a new general of his own choosing  whose name was Hylib bib  who had long entertained an opinion  that the inhabitants of China were not beings of flesh and blood  but mere fantastic shadows  who could neither offend nor be offended  Full of this opinion     224 he made a descent on the coast of that empire  and to convince his followers that his notion was right  he advanced some leagues into the country  without having taken any precautions to secure a retreat  leaving the Fune at anchor upon an open beach  Some people alledged  that he depended upon the sagacity of an engineer recommended to him by Taycho  which engineer had such an excellent nose  that he could smell a Chinese at the distance of ten leagues  but it seems the scent failed him at this juncture  Perhaps the Chinese general had trailed rusty bacon and other odoriferous substances to confound his sense of smelling  Perhaps no dew had fallen over night  and a strong breeze blew towards the enemy  Certain
