 sir  to know that I am bad  when   I do not know how to make myself better  for to day I thought   and meant to be very good  and yet found myself in the end to be   worse than ever  But as you say  to be sure I have been very bad    though I hardly knew any thing of the matter till now  I now re    member how I had like to murder poor Mr  Vindex with the sword    and a hundred other things if I could bring them to mind   What   shall I do then  sir oh   what shall I do to grow good       I will tell you  my Harry  says Mr  Fenton  And as you have   generously intrusted me with one secret  that of having a very bad   boy within you   it is but fair that I should intrust you with another   secret  which is that of having an exceeding good boy within you          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  165     What  two boys in one  sir  how can that be   It is even so  my   darling   you yourself told me as much  Did you not say that  this   very day  the one was struggling and fighting within you against   the other  that the one was proud  scornful  ostentatious  and   revengeful   the other humble  gentle  generous  loving  and for    giving  and that when the bad boy got the better  the good boy   took him to task  and reprimanded and severely rebuked him  and   made him cry bitterly      What you say  indeed  sir  is something very like it   only I can    not think how one boy can be two boys  Do you remember  Harry    what you read last night in the Old Testament about Bebekah  the   wife of Isaac  when she was with child   Yes  very well  sir  As   how she was with child with twins   and the children struggled   together within her   and she said  If it be so  why am I thus   and   she went to inquire of the Lord   Very right  my love   and I now   say to you what God then said to Rebekah  I do not mean that   you have two boys within you  of the bodily bulk  features  and   shape of yourself  but that you have two different spirits or prin    ciples within you  which  like Esau and Jacob  have quite different   and adverse natures  inclinations  and desires   the one prompting   and hurrying you into all that is evil  the other inviting and leading   you into all that is good  So you see  Harry  and you have felt   that  like Eebekah  you have your own Esau and your own Jacob   struggling within your bosom  and the war between them shall   never cease  till the one shall have wholly conquered and subjected   the other      To make this matter plainer and clearer to you  my darling  I   will tell you a pretty story out of the book that is in my hand      Cyrus was a king and a great conqueror  but in his private   capacity a very virtuous man  On a day  some of his captains  just   returned from an expedition  informed him that they had brought   him the greatest wonder in the world  a young princess called   Panthea  whom they had taken captive  and whose charms exceeded   all that could be imagined of woman      Cyrus  as I told you  was virtuous  He was already married    and he dreaded running the risk of being seduced from his honesty   by the dangerous allurements of this enchanting beauty  He there    fore obstinately  though reluctantly  forbid her approach  and   denied himself the pleasure he might have taken in beholding her      His own honour  however  and the respect due to the quality and   accomplishments of the lady  demanded all possible attention and   precaution in her behalf  For this purpose he summoned his chief   captains and favourites  He asked which of them would adventure   to take the charge of this young beauty   and he promised the highest   rewards to those who should honourably discharge their trust  but   threatened his deepest displeasure to any who should betray it      All of them shrunk at the apprehension of taking upon them   the personal custody and care of a beauty  whom their great and   virtuous monarch had not even dared to look upon   and no one   had offered to
