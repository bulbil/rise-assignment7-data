extravagant Effects Poets ascrib d to the Power of Sounds  I immediately became Consort Hunter —studied Compositions  and cou d relish no Companions  but those who understood the Nature of Unisons  but was very much surpriz d to find that most musical Performers look d with Disdain on the Professors of every Art and Science but their own  Yet  except in their own  they are the most incurious and unentertaining of any other Artists  Nay  even in the very Branch they excel  you must tire yourself with requesting  before they ll exhibit  But when once they begin  they know not how to stop  but are as palling  by doing too much  as they were disgustful before by not doing any thing  I bid adieu to the Gamut  least it shou d lead me into the same Infatuation   My next Attempt was extremely amusing —I studied Painting and   42Sculpture  but was shock d at the unfriendly Treatment  several Men of Merit gave their Contemporaries   I had like to have tumbled over Head and Ears into the Tide of Taste  and become Picture fancier  Auction hunter  and Connoisseur  But as I had studied without travelling  my Opinions were not of equal Weight  with those who had travell d without studying   The better to judge of Sculpture  and some parts of Painting  I found it necessary to apply myself to Anatomy  and as that  in some Measure  is connected with both natural and experimental Philosophy  I soon gave myself up entirely to the Investigations of Nature  I dragg d the Ditches for Embryo s  committed Burglary upon the Habitations of half form d Insects  stripp d Trees of their Moss  examin d Puff balls  and search d for the Heads of Snake Stones   I have seen  Sir  the Circulation of Blood in a Frog s Toes  Spider s Leg  and a Shrimp s Tail  I have counted the Number of blue Animals a Sloe has upon its Surface  and knew accurately  what Pen feathers there were in a Butterfly s Wing   Many curious Observations have I made upon Duck weed  and Dunghill water    43and the several Animalcula in each   I have impaled Gnats upon Pins  to try how long they cou d live without eating  Have press d Wood lice and Silk worms to Death  to discover their seminal Animalcula  and destroy d many Colonies of Ants  to be certain whether they did  or did not bite off the Ends of the Corn  I have attended the microscopical Dissections of Bugs  to resolve that grand Debate among the Learned  whether they were or were not Hermaphrodites  I have also open d Batts  to authenticate what Genius they shou d be class d under  Birds  or Beasts   Junior   Do you think  Sir  these Studies benefit the Understanding   Saltern   Yes  Sir —just as much as making your Fences in the Chinese Manner wou d improve your Estate —Yet so far is Prejudice prevailing  that were we to deride such Pursuits  all the minute Philosophers wou d be alarm d  and our Treatment wou d be as severe  as if at Madrid  we shou d reason against Saint worshiping —I own  I have been astonish d at beholding Millions of Beings  smaller than the smallest Grain of Sand    44skimming upon the Water  sailing along the Air  and circulating in our finest Fluids  I ask d myself seriously what these cou d be for —That For  was my Gordian Knot   I determin d to find out a Man of Sense  to whom I cou d communicate my Doubts  and by comparing our Opinions  we might come to know  why  and for what End these Things were so —I related my Design to the only surviving Relation I have  a prodigious Humourist   When he had heard me out —he shook his Head   methinks I see him now  and reply d —Oh  Nephew  Nephew  before you endeavour to account for the Deity s Actions  regulate your own  Don t begin the Study of Wisdom at the wrong End  like some of our Folks of Fashion  who are sent Abroad  before they see their own Country —Receive Things as they are  use them as they shou d be  employ your Talents in praise worthy Exercises  but throw not away your Time in vain Speculations  like the thirsty Lunatic  who  when he arrived at a River  instead of quenching his Thirst  lost himself in looking for the Spring head     45I made him a Bow  thanked him for his Advice  promis d him to consider of it  but left the Room  and my Promise behind me —like a Lover  who requests his Friend s Opinion  tho  he is already determin d—I set out upon my Travels immediately  to search for a Man of Sense   I knew Nature not partial to Birth  therefore fancy d Understanding  like Beauty  might be found among the meanest  and began my Enquiry among the Shepherds  and Labourers —but found them as reasonless  as the Cattle they tended  They possess d a low Cunning  which answer d all their Ends   Junior   Poets indeed amuse us  Sir
