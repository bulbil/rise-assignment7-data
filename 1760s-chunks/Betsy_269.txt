extricated from that terrible dilemma she had brought herself   into       But as this was a thing in it s very nature  as affairs had been   managed  morally impossible to be accomplished  all their endeavours to   that purpose only served to shew them the extreme vanity of the attempt    and consequently to render them more miserable       Despair  at length  and the near prospect of approaching want  so   humbled the once haughty spirit of Lady Mellasin  that she resolved on   writing to Mr  Edward Goodman  to make use of all her rhetorick to   soothe him into forgiveness for the troubles she had occasioned   him  and  in fine  to petition relief from the very man whom she had   made use of the most villainous arts to prejudice       The contents of her letter to that much injured gentleman were as   follows             To Edward Goodman  Esq            Sir            Appearances are so much against me that I scarce dare say I am        innocent  though I know myself so  as to any intention of doing you        injustice  I cannot  however  forbear giving you a short sketch of        the imposition which has been practiced upon me  and in my name        attempted to be put on you            The will  which has occasioned this long contest between us  was        brought me by a person who told me he had drawn it up exactly        according to my late husband s instructions  the very evening        before he died  the subscribing witnesses gave me the same        assurance  and also added  that Mr  Goodman was so well convinced        of my integrity  and the wrong he had done me by suspecting it         that had he lived only to the next morning  he had resolved to send        for me home  and be reconciled to me in the face of the world  so        that  if the thing was a piece of forgery  these men are only        guilty  I am entirely free from any share in it            But as these proceedings  which I have unhappily been prevailed        upon to countenance  have given you a great deal of trouble and        expence  I sincerely ask your pardon for it  this is all the        atonement I can make to Heaven for offences more immediately my        own            I am very sensible  notwithstanding  that  by what I have done  I        have not only forfeited my claim to such part of the effects of Mr         Goodman as appertain to the widow of an eminent and wealthy        citizen  but  likewise  all my pretensions to the friendship and        favour of the person he has made his heir  yet  Sir  however guilty        I may seem to you  or how great my faults in reality may have been         I cannot help being of opinion that  when you remember I was once        the wife of an uncle  whose memory you have so much cause to value         you will think the name and character I have borne  ought to defend        me from publick infamy  parish alms  and beggary            Reduced as I am  it would ill become me to make any stipulations         or lay a tax on the goodness I am necessitated to implore  No  Sir         as I can now demand nothing  so  also  I can hope for nothing but        from your compassion and generosity  and to these two amiable        qualities alone shall ascribe whatever provision you shall think        fit to make for me out of that abundance I was once in full        possession of            I shall add no more  than to intreat you will consider  with some
