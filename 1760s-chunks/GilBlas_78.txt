much below par  but I was not long a burden on his hospitality  At the week s end  he told me that he had mentioned my name to a gentleman of his acquaintance  who wanted a valet de chambre  and  according to present appearances  the place would not be long vacant  In fact  this gentleman happened to make his appearance in the very nick    Sir  said Melendez  pushing me forward  you see before you the young man as by former advice  He is a pupil of honour and integrity  I can answer for him as if he was one of my own family  The gentleman looked at me with attention  said that my face was in my favour  and hired me at once  He has nothing to do but to follow me  added he  I will put him into the routine of his employment  At these words he wished the tradesman good morning  and took me into the High  street  directly over against St Philip s church  We went into a very handsome house  of which he occupied one wing  then going up five or six steps  he took me into a room secured by strong double doors  with an iron grate between  From this room we went into another  with a bed and other furniture  rather neat than gaudy   If my new master had examined me closely  I had all my wits about me as well as he  He was a man on the wrong side of fifty  with a saturnine and serious air  His temper seemed to be even  and I thought no harm of him  He asked me several questions about my family  and liking my answers    Gil Blas  said he  I take you to be a very sensible lad  and am well pleased to have you in my service  On your part  you shall have no reason to complain  I will give you six rials a day board wages  besides vails  Then I require no great attendance  for I keep no table  but always dine out  You will only have to brush my clothes  and be your own master for the rest of the day  Only take care to be at home early in the evening  and to be in waiting at the door  that is your chief duty  After this lecture  he took six rials out of his purse  and gave them to me as earnest  We then went out  he locked the doors after him  and taking care of the keys    My friend  said he  you need not go with me  follow the devices of your own heart  but on my return this evening  let me find you on that staircase  With this injunction he left me to dispose of myself as seemed best in my own eyes   In good sooth  Gil Blas  said I in a soliloquy  you have got a jewel of a master  What  fall in with an employer to give you six rials a day for wiping off the dust from his clothes  and putting his room to rights in the morning  with the liberty of walking about and taking your pleasure like a schoolboy in the holidays  By my troth  it is a place of ten thousand  No wonder I was in a hurry to get to Madrid  it was doubtless some mysterious boding of good fortune prepared for me  I spent the day in the streets  diverting myself with gaping at novelties    a busy occupation  In the evening  after supping at an ordinary not far from our house  I squatted myself down in the corner pointed out by my master  He came three quarters of an hour after me  and seemed pleased with my punctuality  Very well  said he  this is right  I like attentive servants  At these words  he opened the doors of his apartment  and closed them upon us again as soon as we had got in  As we had no candle  he took his tinder box and struck a light  I then helped him to undress  When he was in bed  I lighted  by his order  a lamp in his chimney  and carried the wax light into the antechamber  where I lay in a press bed without curtains  He got up the next day between nine and ten o clock  I brushed his clothes  He paid me my six rials  and sent me packing till the evening  My mysterious master went out himself too  not without great caution in fastening the doors  and we parted for the remainder of the day   Such was our course of life  very agreeable to me  The best of the joke was  that I did not know my master s name  Melendez did not know it himself  The gentleman came to his shop now and then  and bought a piece of cloth  My neighbours were as much at a loss as myself  they all assured me that my master was a perfect stranger  though he had lived two years in the ward  He visited no soul in the neighbourhood  and some of them  a little given to scandal  concluded him to be no better than he should be  Suspicions got to
