repeated howlings  expressed their sorrow for the death of their  charitable benefactor  Peregrine  though he felt everything which  love and gratitude could inspire on this occasion  was not so much  overwhelmed with affliction as to be incapable of taking the management  of the family into his own hands  He gave directions about the funeral  with great discretion  after having paid the compliments of condolence  to his aunt  whom he consoled with the assurance of his inviolable  esteem and affection  He ordered a suit of mourning to be made for every  person in the garrison  and invited all the neighbouring gentlemen to  the burial  not even excepting his father and brother Gam  who did not   however  honour the ceremony with their presence  nor was his mother  humane enough to visit her sister in law in her distress   In the method of interment  the commodore s injunctions were obeyed to a  title  and at the same time our hero made a donation of fifty pounds to  the poor of the parish  as a benefaction which his uncle had forgot  to bequeath  Having performed these obsequies with the most pious  punctuality  he examined the will  to which there was no addition since  it had first been executed  adjusted the payment of all the legacies   and  being sole executor  took an account of the estate to which he  had succeeded  which  after all deductions  amounted to thirty thousand  pounds  The possession of such a fortune  of which he was absolute  master  did not at all contribute to the humiliation of his spirit  but  inspired him with new ideas of grandeur and magnificence  and elevated  his hope to the highest pinnacle of expectation   His domestic affairs being settled  he was visited by almost all  the gentlemen of the county  who came to pay their compliments of  congratulation on his accession to the estate  and some of them offered  their good offices towards a reconciliation betwixt his father and him   induced by the general detestation which was entertained for his brother  Gam  who was by this time looked upon by his neighbours as a prodigy  of insolence and malice  Our young squire thanked them for their kind  proposal  which he accepted  and old Gamaliel  at their entreaties   seemed very well disposed to any accommodation  but as he would not  venture to declare himself before he had consulted his wife  his  favourable disposition was rendered altogether ineffectual  by the  instigations of that implacable woman  and our hero resigned all  expectation of being reunited to his father s house  His brother   as usual  took all opportunities of injuring his character  by false  aspersions  and stories misrepresented  in order to prejudice his  reputation  nor was his sister Julia suffered to enjoy her good fortune  in peace  Had he undergone such persecution from an alien to his blood   the world would have heard of his revenge  but  notwithstanding  his indignation  he was too much tinctured by the prejudices of  consanguinity  to lift his arm in judgment against the son of his own  parents  and this consideration abridged the term of his residence at  the garrison  where he had proposed to stay for some months   VOLUME II      6 22 15  3 45 PM   CHAPTER LXXIV   The young Gentleman  having settled his domestic Affairs  arrives  in London  and sets up a gay Equipage  He meets with Emilia  and is  introduced to her Uncle   His aunt  at the earnest solicitations of Julia and her husband  took  up her quarters at the house of that affectionate kinswoman  who made  it her chief study to comfort and cherish the disconsolate widow  and  Jolter  in expectation of the living  which was not yet vacant  remained  in garrison  in quality of land steward upon our hero s country estate   As for the lieutenant  our young gentleman communed with him in a  serious manner  about the commodore s proposal of taking Mrs  Trunnion  to wife  and Jack  being quite tired of the solitary situation of a  bachelor  which nothing but the company of his old commander could have  enabled him to support so long  far from discovering aversion from the  match  observed with an arch smile  that it was not the first time  he had commanded a vessel in the absence of Captain Trunnion  and  therefore  if the widow was willing  he would cheerfully stand by her  helm  and  as he hoped the duty would not be of long continuance  do his  endeavour to steer her safe into port  where the commodore might come on  board  and take charge of her again   In consequence of this declaration  it was determined that Mr  Hatchway  should make his addresses to Mrs  Trunnion as soon as decency would  permit her to receive them  and Mr  Clover and his wife promised to  exert their influence on his behalf  Meanwhile  Jack was desired to live  at the castle as usual  and assured  that it should be put wholly
