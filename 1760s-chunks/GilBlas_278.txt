interference in my behalf  Sir  answered she  Theodora can do what she pleases with me  She has brought me over to your side of the question  and if I can do you a kindness  you shall soon be at the summit of your wishes  but  with all my partiality in your favour  I know not how far my efforts may be successful  It would be cruel to mislead you  the prize will not be gained without a severe conflict  The object of your passion is betrothed to another gentleman  and her character most inauspicious to your designs  Such is her pride  and so closely locked are her secrets within her own breast  that if  by constancy and assiduities  you could extort from her a few sighs  fancy not that her haughty spirit would indulge your ears with their music  Ah  my dear Felicia  exclaimed I in an agony  why will you thus magnify the obstacles in my way  To set them in array will kill me  Lead me on with false hopes  if you will  but do not drive me to despair  With these words I took one of her hands  pressed it between mine  and slid a diamond on her finger value three hundred pistoles  with such a moving compliment as made her weep again   Such speeches and corresponding actions deserved some scanty comfort  She smoothed a little the rugged path of love  Sir  said she  what I have just been telling you need not quite quench your hope  Your rival  it is true  is in possession of the ground  He comes back and fore as he pleases  he toys with her as often as he likes  but all that is in your favour  The habit of constant intercourse sheds a languor over their meetings  They part without pain  and come together without emotion  One would take them for man and wife  In a word  my mistress has no marks of violent love for Don Austin  Besides  in point of person  there is such a difference between you and him as cannot fail to catch the eye of a nice observer like Donna Helena  Therefore do not be cast down  Continue your particular attentions  You shall have a second in me  I shall let no opportunity escape of pointing out to my mistress the merit of all your exertions to please her  In vain shall she intrench herself behind reserve  In spite of guard and garrison  I will ransack the muster roll of her sentiments   Now were my open attacks and secret ambuscades more fiercely pointed against the daughter of Don George  Among the rest  I entertained her with a serenade  After the concert Felicia  to sound her mistress  begged to know how she had been entertained  The singer had a good voice  said Donna Helena  But how did you like the words  replied the abigail  I scarcely noted them  returned the lady  the music engrossed my whole attention  The poetry excited as little curiosity as its author  If that is the case  exclaimed the chambermaid  poor Don Gaston do Cogollos is reckoning without his host  and a miserable spendthrift of his glances  to be always ogling at our lattice work  Perhaps it may not be he  said the mistress with petrifying indifference  but some other spark  announcing his passion by this concert  Excuse me  answered Felicia  it is Don Gaston himself who accosted me this morning in the street  and implored me to assure you how he adored  in defiance of your rigorous repulses  but that he should esteem himself the most blest of mortals  if you would allow him to soothe his desponding thoughts by all the most delicate and impassioned attentions  Judge now if I can be mistaken  after so open an avowal   Don George s daughter changed countenance at once  and said to her servant with a severe frown  You might well have dispensed with the relation of this impertinent discourse  Bring me no more such idle tales  and tell this young madman  when next he accosts you  to play off his shallow artifices on some more accommodating fool  but  at all events  let him choose a more gentlemanly recreation than that of lounging all day at his window  and prying into the privacy of my apartment   This message was faithfully delivered at my next interview with Felicia  who assured me that her mistress s modes of speech were not to be taken in their literal construction  but that my affairs were in the best possible train  For my part  being little read in the science of coquetry  and finding no favourable sense on the face of the author s original words  I was half out of humour with the wire drawn comments of the critic  She laughed at my misgiving  and asked her friend for pen  ink  and paper  saying  Sir knight of the doleful countenance  write immediately to Donna Helena as dolefully as you look  Make echo ring with your sufferings  outsigh the river s murmur  and  above all  let rocks and woods resound with the prohibition of appearing at your window  Then pawn your existence on obeying her  though without the possibility ever to redeem the pledge  Turn all that nonsense into pretty sentences
