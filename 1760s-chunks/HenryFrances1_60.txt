the Remembrance is grateful  and  when it ceases to be so  forget  Your Eloise   LETTER CXIII   My dearest HARRY   OUR Journey is fixed  and I am distracted  I know the Prudence of the Scheme in every Point  and yet nothing but Necessity should make me stir  I long to see you  and yet wish it not  For  tho  I were to see you every Day and Hour  I shall never be able to forget  but for a Minute  that I must leave England in May  with a moral Certainty of never seeing it again  Had not Fortune  as it were  rooted you to a peculiar Spot  what I now look upon as the severest Kind of Banishment  could give me but very little Pain  for we are all Citizens of the World —As to my Loss  you will not  cannot feel it  For  in Reality  it is none  and it is as much impossible that you can ever want a more charming  agreeable Friend  as that you can ever find a sincerer —Soon  very soon  you will forget me  while I  alas  a helpless Stranger in a foreign Land  shall neither wish  nor hope for Consolation  for where  or how  or from whom should I receive it     208All that remains  after our last Adieu  is to consider you as an Inhabitant of another World  and myself in a local Purgatory  where having proved my Faith and Constancy  we shall be re united  again shall meet  to part no more — tho  there can be no Certainty that we shall know one another in a future State  I think it is extremely consistent with human Reason  to suppose we shall  for I think it is arraigning the Wisdom of the Almighty  to imagine that he should form us with Passions  and Attractions for each other   which more frequently produce Misery  than Happiness  in this Life  and let those strongest  noblest Faculties of the Soul perish with the Body in the Grave  No—it cannot be  they were ordained to answer higher Ends  to make the everlasting Happiness of his Creatures  and will exist to all Eternity  Besides  we are taught to believe  that we must render an Account of our past Lives  Sure    Love is the informing  active Fire  that kindles up the Mass   and is it not the highest Absurdity to suppose  that  when in a State of Perfection  we shall remember the Effects  but forget the Cause  — I would not lose this Hope  for any Certainty the World could give me  — Oh  my best loved  my ever dear  and charming Friend  part  when we will  we have an Eternity to spend together  and  tho  I do not flatter myself with holding the first  or   209 highest Place in your Regard  I dare boast of as sincere  as tender  and as constant an Affection for you  as ever  faithful Woman felt  or false one feigned   and there  where all the Mists of Error shall be cleared away   our Forms transparent  naked every Thought   a Passion  such as mine  must have some Claim     As to what you mention with Regard to Fortune  give me Leave to assure you in the most solemn Manner  that  were your s equal to your utmost Wish  it should not make any Alteration in mine  I love you much too well   were it in my Power  to buy my Happiness  at the Price of your s  and  whatever Idea you may have formed of my Sentiments for you  I swear by that all seeing Power  who knows my inmost Thoughts  that Fortune never had the smallest Share in my unchangeable Affection for you  and  could you seat me on a Throne this Moment  it might add to my Gratitude  but could not  to my Love  The sole Concern  I have ever had about your Fortune  with Regard to myself  was  that it s not being as easy  as you could wish  might perhaps engage you to enter into a Situation  which must render my Affection for you criminal  This  I own  has often filled my Heart with Sorrow  and my Eyes with Tears  as the constant Result of this Thought was a fixed Resolution never to see you more  But  when I have considered it would   210 be for your Happiness  I quickly found  I could give up my own —All Reflections of this Kind are now over  and  since the long feared  fatal Separation must arrive  I think  I could  without betraying any Weakness  hear you were married to a deserving Woman  with a good Fortune  For  since it is not in my Power to make you happy  all that remains  is  with Sincerity and Truth  to wish you so   I long impatiently to see you  yet would  by no Means  have you come   till it suits your own Convenience  I have ten thousand Things to say to you    for I
