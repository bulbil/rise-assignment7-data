the scullion  he was promoted to the situation next under the cook   The Neapolitan was furious at encountering me in every direction  The most aggravating circumstance of the whole was the overhauling of his accounts  for  to pare his nails the closer  I had gone into the market  and informed myself of the prices  I followed him through all his doublings  and always took off the market penny which he wanted to add  He must have cursed me a hundred times a day  but the curses of the wicked fall in blessings on the good  I wonder how he could stay in his place under such discipline  but probably something still stuck by the fingers   Fabricio  whom I saw occasionally  rather blamed my conduct than otherwise  Heaven grant  said he  one day  that all this virtue may meet with its reward  But between ourselves you might as well be a little more practicable with the clerk of the kitchen  What  answered I  shall this freebooter put a bold face upon the matter  and charge a fish at ten pistoles in his bill  which costs only four  and would you have me pass the articles in my accounts  Why not  replied he  coolly  He has only to let you go snacks in the commission  and the books will be balanced in your favour by the customary rule of stewardship arithmetic  Upon my word  my friend  you are enough to overturn all regular systems of housekeeping  and you are likely to end your days in a livery  if you let the eel slip through your fingers without skinning it  You are to learn that fortune is a very woman  ready and eager to surrender  but expecting the formality of a summons   I only laughed at this doctrine  and Nunez laughed at it too  when he found that bad advice was thrown away upon an incorrigibly honest subject  He then wished to make me believe it was all a mere joke  At all events  nothing could shake my resolution to act for my employer as for myself  Indeed my actions corresponded with my words on that subject  for I may venture to say that in four months my master saved at least three thousand ducats by my thrift       CH  XVI     An accident happens to the Count de Galiano s monkey  his lordship s affliction on that occasion  The illness of Gil Blas  and its consequences   AT the expiration of the before mentioned time  the repose of the family was marvellously troubled by an accident  which will appear but a trifle to the reader  and yet it was a very serious matter to the household  especially to me  Cupid  the monkey of whom I was speaking  that animal  so much the idol of our lord and master  attempting to leap from one window to another  performed so ill as to fall into the court and put his leg out of joint  No sooner were the fatal tidings carried to the count  than he sung a dirge which pealed through all the neighbourhood  In the extremity of his sufferings  every inmate without exception was taken to task  and we were all within an inch of being packed off about our business  But the storm only rumbled without falling  he gave us and our negligence to the devil  without being by any means select in the terms of the bequest  The most notorious of the faculty in the line of fractures and dislocations were sent for  They examined the poor dear leg  set  and bound it up  But though they all gave it as their opinion that there was no danger  my master could not be satisfied without retaining the most eminent about the person of the animal  till he could be pronounced to be in a state of convalescence   It would be a manifest injustice to the family affections of his Sicilian lordship  not to commemorate all the agonizing sensations of his soul during this period of painful suspense  Would it be thought possible that this tender nurse did not stir from his darling Cupid s bedside all the live long day  The bandages were never altered or adjusted but in his presence  and he got up two or three times in the night to inquire after his patient  The most provoking part of the business was  that all the servants  and myself in particular  were required to be eternally on the alert  to anticipate the slightest wishes of this ridiculous baboon  In short  there was no peace in the house  till the cursed beast  having recovered from the effects of its fall  got back again to his old tricks and whirligigs  After this shall we be mealy mouthed about believing Suetonius  when he tells us that Caligula cared more for his horse than for all the world besides  that he gave him more than the establishment and attendance of a senator  and that he even wanted to make him consul  Our wise master stopped little short of the emperor in his partiality to the monkey  and had serious thoughts of purchasing for him the place of corregidor   Mine was the worst luck of any in the family  for I had so topped my part above all the other servants  by way of paying my court to
