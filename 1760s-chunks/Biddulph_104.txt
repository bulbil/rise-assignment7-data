the least injury in any body’s opinion here     the ladies in France do not think it any disgrace to have lovers   You are very obliging  Sir  she replied  and perhaps I have as much to say in my vindication as any woman  but sure never was mortal used in the barbarous manner I am  Do you know the proposal he had the insolence to make me last night  Either to take a husband of his chusing  any low fellow  I suppose  he thinks good enough for me   or immediately to go into a nunnery  Oh  Sir  and she catched hold of his hand  as you are a gentleman  if you have compassion  any humanity towards an unfortunate woman  try to deliver me out of his hands  I have a pretty good sum of money in my possession  contrive the means of my escape  my gratitude to you shall be unbounded  and she wrung his hand   Ah  Madam  said Pivet  looking tenderly at her  I would it were in my power  I should think myself but too happy if it were possible for me to accomplish what you request  but I fear it will be impracticable  I declare to you  if I were at my own disposal  I would fly with you to the remotest part of the world  but I am a young man  who have my fortune to make  I am under particular ties here  and have besides such obligations to Mr Faulkland  as makes it impossible for me  consistently with honour  to interfere in this business   Sir  said she eagerly  can’t you write a letter for me  or furnish me with the means of informing my friends in England of my situation   Madam  said he  before Mr Faulkland permitted me the honour of seeing you  he engaged my solemn promise that I would not intermeddle in your affairs   Lord  what will become of me  What would you  Sir  advise me to do  For as for that wretch  meaning me   I am determined  if I can help it  not to suffer him to come near me   ’Tis a very nice point  Madam  I really do not well know how to advise  but  to be sure  a nunnery is a choice not to be recommended to a lady of your youth and beauty  unless your inclinations lead you that way  then indeed—  She interrupted him  Don’t name it to me  Sir  don’t name it  I am determined to keep out of that snare  if it be for nothing but an opportunity to be revenged on that tyrant  I would marry a beggar sooner than give up that hope   As for that  Madam  said Pivet  I suppose Mr Faulkland would not be so ungenerous as to compel you to marry one beneath you  there are many young men of good families who would think themselves honoured by your acceptance of them  your personal accomplish    ments alone are a sufficient recommendation  but Mr Faulkland mentioned to me the additional advantage of fortune  I dare answer for him he will not think of bestowing you unworthily   I had charged Pivet not to go too far  he thought it time to break off the conversation  and  rising up  he told Mrs Gerrarde he was going into my apartment  and desired to know if she would honour him with any commands   Sir  said she  I shall only beg you will tell Mr Faulkland  that I never can think of his proposal  that I am very ill  and beg to be left in quiet for a few days  but shall be very glad to see you whenever you are at leisure   He bowed  and left her  then came directly to me  and repeated the conversation he had with her word for word  I am glad  said I  to find you are so much in her good graces  it will accelerate my plot  but we must not make you too cheap  if we manage discreetly  she may possibly think herself very well to get off with you   At present I stand pretty well with her  Sir  said Pivet  she does not suspect that I am your servant  I fear if she did  as the lady seems to have a high spirit  she would forbid me her presence   I found Pivet had no mind to have this part of his situation explained  his vanity had been highly tickled at passing upon her for a gentleman  and my friend —He had  in obedience to my orders  spent much of his time with her during the few days that I had been too ill to see her  I had  at my first introduction of him to her  cautioned him against letting her know in what capacity he was with me  I did not then give him my reasons for this  and he supposed they were no other  than that  finding it necessary to have him pretty much with her in her confinement  I did not chuse to alarm her pride by the knowlege of his station  I did not hint at my design till the day before I had prevailed on her to write
