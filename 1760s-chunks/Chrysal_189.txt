captain of an   English privateer to rifle a ship that we prepare properly for the   purpose  and then to come into the way of one of our men of war    which is to take him and bring him in  where he is to insult the   government  and vindicate his outrages on the pretence of   authority         And pray  Mynheer  what can you propose from all this  beside   having the foolish villain hanged           Why  the English  in detestation of such villany  will give up the   point of searching our ships when they see their authority abused   in such a manner  and so we shall gain our end that way   or  if   they do not  our own people will be so enraged at the insult and   injustice  as they will believe  of their proceeding  that they will   immediately declare war against them   and so we shall obtain it   the other  The pirate  when he has served our turn  we are to let   Â«3cape  and it will be no great loss to the world if half a score of his   crew are hanged          A very just and public spirited scheme indeed  to hang wretches   for a crime you hire them to commit  and engage your country in   a war that must be its ruin  to support your pretensions to an   unjustifiable trade          Mynheer Van Hogan  I am a Dutchman as well as you  and   attached to my interest  as every Dutchman is   but that is    when my interest is not destructive of itself in the end  as I must   tell you I think your present scheme is  in which I will be no   further concerned  than to try to prevent the evil consequences   of it to the state  the rest may lie upon your own head    Anything in the way of trade my conscience complies with with    out scruple   I can take every oath that every officer of the   customs can impose  and not think myself bound by any of them    further than they agree with my interest  I can supply the enemies   of my country with arms to fight against ourselves  provided they   pay a price extraordinary  that will defray my taxes towards the   support of the war  I can receive circumcision  stroke down   my beard  and swear by Mahomet to avoid a tax at Smyrna  I   can trample upon the Cross  deny Christ  and call myself a   Dutchman  to obtain leave to trade in Japan  but I will   not cut the dykes to drown a rat at home  I am not   at leisure to say more on this subject  as I am this         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 211     minute going to remit a subsidy to one of the German princes     whom England keeps in pay  to fight for their own preservation    from the same principles that it has long fought our battles  and   would again  if we did not provoke it too far  And when this is   done  I am to meet the French ambassador  to settle terms with   him  for remitting the money that is to pay the army which fights   against the allies of England  So that you see I am engaged  as   you may be  if your warmth  unnatural to the cool temper of yoxir   country  will let you open your eyes to your true interest        Mynheer Van Hogan departed rather silenced than satisfied with   the reasoning of my master  who sat down to negotiate the hire of   a priacipality with as much unconcern as he would that of a turnip    field   and bought and sold the inhabitants with as great indiffer    ence as he would have bargained for a cask of herrings  in which   service it fell to my lot to be employed      Greatly as I must have edified by the examples and principles    mercantile  moral  civil  and religious  of my late master  I must   own there was something so grossly reprobate to every sense of   real virtue  even in him  that I was pleased to leave him  and  in    deed  to be candid  the country in general  where every profession   of virtue was despised  their only pretension to it being the absence   of one  hypocrisy  which they rejected as an unnecessary incum    brance  and acted their grossest enormities without reserve  or   appearance of shame      I now entered on the great theatre of the world  where the   sovereign actor gave a dignity to
