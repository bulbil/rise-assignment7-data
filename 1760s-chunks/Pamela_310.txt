see you want to know what s   become of the poor mother   Tis natural enough you should  but I was   willing to see how the little suspense would operate upon you   Dear   sir  said I   Nay  replied he   tis very natural  my dear  I think you   have had a great deal of patience  and are come at this question so   fairly that you deserve to be answered       You must know then  there is some foundation for saying  that her   mother  at least  lives in Jamaica  for there she does live  and very   happily too  For I must observe  that she suffered so much in child bed    that nobody expected her life  and this  when she was up  made such an   impression upon her  that she dreaded nothing so much as the thoughts of   returning to her former fault  and  to say the truth  I had intended to   make her a visit as soon as her month was well up  And so  unknown to   me  she engaged herself to go to Jamaica  with two young ladies  who   were born there  and were returning to their friends  after they had   been four years in England for their education  and  recommending to me    by a very moving letter  her little baby  and that I would not suffer it   to be called by her name  but Goodwin  that her shame might be the less   known  for hers and her family s sake  she got her friends to assign   her five hundred pounds  in full of all her demands upon her family  and   went up to London  and embarked  with her companions  at Gravesend    and so sailed to Jamaica  where she is since well and happily married    passing to her husband for a young widow  with one daughter  which her   husband s friends take care of  and provide for  And so you see  Pamela    that in the whole story on both sides  the truth is as much preserved as   possible       Poor lady  said I  how her story moves me  I am glad she is so happy   at last   And  my dear  said he  are you not glad she is so far off   too   As to that  sir  said I  I cannot be sorry  to be sure  as she   is so happy  which she could not have been here  For  sir  I doubt you   would have proceeded with your temptations  if she had not gone  and   it shewed she was much in earnest to be good  that she could leave her   native country  leave all her relations  leave you  whom she so well   loved  leave her dear baby  and try a new fortune  in a new world  among   quite strangers  and hazard the seas  and all to preserve herself from   further guiltiness  Indeed  indeed  sir  said I  I bleed for what   her distresses must be  in this case I am grieved for her poor mind s   remorse  through her childbed terrors  which could have so great and so   worthy an effect upon her afterwards  and I honour her resolution  and   would rank such a returning dear lady in the class of those who are   most virtuous  and doubt not God Almighty s mercy to her  and that her   present happiness is the result of his gracious providence  blessing her   penitence and reformation   But  sir  said I  did you not once see the   poor lady after her lying in       I did not believe her so much in earnest  answered he  and I went down   to Marlborough  and heard she was gone from thence to Calne  I went to   Calne  and heard she was gone to Reading  to a relation s there  Thither   I went  and heard she was gone to Oxford  I followed  and there she was    but I could not see her       She at last received a letter from me  begging a meeting with her  for   I found her departure with the ladies was resolved on  and that she was   with her friends  only to take leave of them  and receive her agreed   on portion  And she appointed the Saturday following  and that was   Wednesday  to give me a meeting at the old place  at Woodstock       Then  added he  I thought I was sure of her  and doubted not I should   spoil her intended voyage  I set out on Thursday to Gloucester  on a   party of pleasure  and on Saturday I went to the place appointed  at
