for what you would be  Like a skilful Lapidary  I valued the Jewel in the Stone  thinking the Polishing could add but an inconsiderable Value to intrinsic Worth   Adieu   Henry     274  LETTER CXLI  FRANCES to HENRY   I DO not believe there are any Words  that can possibly describe the Situation of my Mind  I think  I want but a small Matter to render me as incapable of feeling  as I am of expressing it  but as I    even in Madness  love thee   my Heart received a momentary Calm from your dear Letter  and   for a While  forgot the Approach of Caesar   You  doubtless  expect that I should assign some Reason for the extraordinary Emotion I have mentioned  but it arises from such a Multiplicity of odd Circumstances  that it would be impossible for me even to recollect the thousandth Part of them  In short  my Memory  tho  contrary to your Opinion  accompanied what little Understanding I had  and they are both marched off together  Whoever finds  may take them for their Pains  I should be ashamed to claim them  There is no body doubts the Mind s Suffering with the Body  and I positively affirm  that the Body returns the Compliment  for I am  at this Instant  so extremely ill  and tremble so violently  that I can hardly hold the Pen  And it is more than probable I should have enjoyed a moderate Share of Health  if my Mind had not been hurt and harrassed     Any Person of Sense or Taste  who has ever had the Happiness of conversing with you  can   275 easily account for your general Dislike to what is called Conversation  and what is still worse  you are the Cause of this Disrelish in others  For my Part  I have often lamented  on this Account  that we were ever acquainted  for  as by a fatal Necessity  we are obliged to pass so much of our Time asunder  the little  we spend together  hardly compensates for passing the greatest Part of my Life in a strong Contempt  or  at best  insipid  tasteless Apathy to every Thing I hear or see —As we are on this Topic  I will venture to say  what to anybody else  who did not know me very well  would appear vastly impertinent and vain —that I have often  in the Company of Fools  been ashamed to give any Proofs of the little Understanding which Providence has blest me with  and have left a Party of Idiots thoroughly satisfied  that I was  by many Degrees  sillier than any of the Sett   Adieu   Frances   LETTER CXLII   My dear HELOISE   THAT I have shewn you any Beauties in your Poem  which you observed not before  is owing to the Eye not seeing itself  but by Reflection  and  like a Mirrour  have barely reported the Form  not capable of improving it    276 But I have this Advantage in the Simile  that the Substance of your dear Image shall always remain with me  tho  the Shadow of it should be vanished   — As learned Commentators view  More Things in Homer  that e er Homer knew   So it is the Character of all Persons of Genius to say Things  the Beauties of which they were not aware of  For  as all Truth  Harmony  and Order are but the Expressions of the innate Ideas of a perfect Mind  it is natural for the human Soul  exerted to its proper Force  to hint  unconscious  at Science or Philosophy  which it had never learned or thought of  The utmost of my Art can but explain your Wit or Sense  not improve them  and  as indeed you have more of both  than it is possible your Youth and Inexperience should have Skill enough to find out  it shall be henceforth my pleasing Task to make that Mine current  which shines by Use  and  like other Treasures  increases by Communication   I do not recollect what Lines of mine you hint at  if you mention them more particularly  I shall send them  to shew my Obedience  even after your s   I am still in the same Study of Montaigne  and have begun him again  in the old Edition I had formerly by me  as  perhaps  that may give me Light into some Passages  which are very obscurely   277 translated in the new one  and the Press of this is also the most imperfect  I ever saw  of any Book  The Errors  which the Sense can set you right in  are not material  but there are some very unlucky ones  which lead you quite astray from the Subject  as  particularly  unite for untye   c   c  which I mention to put you on your Guard  as you go thro  it   I declare  I never received more Pleasure or Satisfaction from any Author  in my Life  than this  He has a thorough Knowledge of the World and human Nature  and more Wit than all the Epigrams which were ever wrote  and many
