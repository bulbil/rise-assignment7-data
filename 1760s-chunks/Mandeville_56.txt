account of himself         There is nothing in my past life but what is  I fear  too usual to be worth relating  Warmth of temper  and the vanity of youth  seduced me into a circle of company not to be kept up  by one of my fortune  at a less price than ruin  and the same vanity  with inexperience and a false opinion of mankind  betrayed me into views not less destructive        My father unhappily died when I was about nineteen  leaving me at college  master of my own actions  of the little estate you see  and of four thousand pounds  a sum I then thought inexhaustible  The reputation of such a sum in my own power drew about me all the worthless young men of fashion in the university  whose persuasions and examples led me into a train of expence          2 51       to which my fortune was far from being equal  they flattered those talents of which I thought but too well myself  and easily persuaded me I only wanted to be known in the great world to rise to what height I pleased  I accompanied them to town  full of the idea of raising my fortune  to which they assured me nothing so much contributed as the appearance of being perfectly at ease  To this end I launched into every expence they proposed  dress  equipage  play  and every fashionable extravagance  I was well received every where  and thought my designs in a prosperous way  I found my fortune however decaying at the end of two years  but had not courage to enquire into particulars  till  drawing upon my banker for money to pay some debts I had unwarily contracted  he told me he had already paid the whole      It was some time before he could convince me of this  but  finding his accounts          2 52       had all the appearance of exactness  I was obliged to acquiesce  and went home in an agony of despair  Unable to quit a way of life which was become habitual  and which it was now impossible to support without dishonesty  there is no describing my feelings  After revolving a thousand different schemes in my imagination  I determined to conceal the situation of my affairs  to sell my estate  and  before that money was gone  press my great friends to serve me      I applied to my banker  who undertook to send me a purchaser  but  before I had compleated my design  I received by the post a bank note of five hundred pounds  the sum I was indebted in town  with a letter  in a hand unknown to me  representing  in the most delicate manner  the imprudence of my past conduct  the madness of my views  and the certain consequences of my parting wish this my last stake  intreating me  by the memory of my parents  to preserve          2 53       this sacred deposit  this little remain of what their tender care had left me      Melted with this generosity  struck with the just reproof  yet chained down to that world which had undone me  convinced  yet irresolute  I struggled with my own heart to determine on retiring into the country  but  to postpone as long as possible a retreat  which I could not bear to think of  resolved first to try my great friends  and be certain of what I had to hope for  I represented to them the necessity of immediately attempting in earnest to push my fortune  and  pressing them closely  found their promises were air  They talked in general terms of their esteem for me  of my merit  and each of them expressed the warmest desire of seeing me served by any means but his own  In order to animate their languid friendship  I discovered to them the real state of my affairs  and from that moment found myself avoided by them all           2 54       they dropped me by degrees  were never at home when I called  and at length ceased even to bow to me in public  Ashamed of their own baseness in thus cruelly deserting me  after leading me into ruin  most of them fought to excuse it by blackening my character  whilst the best of them affected coldly to pity me  as a vain foolish fellow  who had undone himself by forgetting his own primeval situation  and arrogantly presuming to live with them      Burning with indignation  I determined at once to break the bands which held me captive  I sold my equipage  discharged my debts  and came down to this place  resolved to find out to whom I had been so obliged  and  by living on half my income  to repay this generous benefactor        I took lodgings in a farm house  and soon found that peace of mind to which I
