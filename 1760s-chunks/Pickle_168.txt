same sort of previous intelligence   From this repository  they went to the great church  and being led  to the tomb of Rubens  the whimsical painter fell upon his knees   and worshipped with such appearance of devotion  that the attendant   scandalized at his superstition  pulled him up  observing  with great  warmth  that the person buried in that place was no saint  but as great  a sinner as himself  and that  if he was spiritually disposed  there was  a chapel of the Blessed Virgin  at the distance of three yards on the  right hand  to which he might retire  He thought it was incumbent upon  him to manifest some extraordinary inspiration  while he resided on the  spot where Rubens was born  and  therefore  his whole behaviour was an  affectation of rapture  expressed in distracted exclamations  convulsive    6 22 15  3 45 PM   starts  and uncouth gesticulations  In the midst of this frantic  behaviour  he saw an old Capuchin  with a white beard  mount the pulpit   and hold forth to the congregation with such violence of emphasis and  gesture  as captivated his fancy  and  bawling aloud   Zounds  what  an excellent Paul preaching at Athens   he pulled a pencil and a small  memorandum book from his pocket  and began to take a sketch of the  orator  with great eagerness and agitation  saying  Egad  friend  Raphael  we shall see whether you or I have got the best knack at  trumping up an apostle   This appearance of disrespect gave offence to  the audience  who began to murmur against this heretic libertine  when  one of the priests belonging to the choir  in order to prevent any ill  consequence from their displeasure  came and told him in the French  language  that such liberties were not permitted in their religion  and  advised him to lay aside his implements  lest the people should take  umbrage at his design  and be provoked to punish him as a profane  scoffer at their worship   The painter  seeing himself addressed by a friar  who  while he spoke   bowed with great complaisance  imagined that he was a begging brother  come to supplicate his charity  and his attention being quite engrossed  by the design he was making  he patted the priest s shaven crown with  his hand  saying  Oter tems  oter tems  and then resumed his pencil with  great earnestness  The ecclesiastic  perceiving that the stranger did  not comprehend his meaning  pulled him by the sleeve  and explained  himself in the Latin tongue  upon which Pallet  provoked at his  intrusion  cursed him aloud for an impudent beggarly son of a w    and   taking out a shilling  flung it upon the pavement  with manifest signs  of indignation   Some of the common people  enraged to see their religion contemned  and  their priests insulted at the very altar  rose from their seats  and   surrounding the astonished painter  one of the number snatched his book  from his hand  and tore it into a thousand pieces  Frightened as he was   he could not help crying  Fire and fagots  all my favourite ideas are  gone to wreck   and was in danger of being very roughly handled by the  crowd  had not Peregrine stepped in  and assured them  that he was a  poor unhappy gentleman  who laboured under a transport of the brain   Those who understood the French language communicated this information  to the rest  so that he escaped without any other chastisement than  being obliged to retire  And as they could not see the famous Descent  from the Cross till after the service was finished  they were conducted  by their domestic to the house of a painter  where they found a  beggar standing for his picture  and the artist actually employed in  representing a huge louse that crawled upon his shoulder  Pallet was  wonderfully pleased with this circumstance  which he said was altogether  a new thought  and an excellent hint  of which he would make his  advantage  and  in the course of his survey of this Fleming s  performances  perceiving a piece in which two flies were engaged upon  the carcass of a dog half devoured  he ran to his brother brush  and  swore he was worthy of being a fellow citizen of the immortal Rubens   He then lamented  with many expressions of grief and resentment  that  he had lost his commonplace book  in which he had preserved a thousand  conceptions of the same sort  formed by the accidental objects of  his senses and imagination  and took an opportunity of telling his  fellow travellers  that in execution he had equalled  if not  excelled  the two ancient painters who had vied with each other in the  representation of a curtain and a bunch of grapes  for he had exhibited    6 22 15  3 45 PM   the image of a certain object so like to nature  that the bare sight of  it set
