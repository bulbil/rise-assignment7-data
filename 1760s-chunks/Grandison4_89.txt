am in sight of the dear house that holds her  I hope she is here  But I will not surprise her with my joy to see her  Lie still  throbbing impatience  speaking to my heart   But when the coach  attended by many neighbours and friends  who  like a gathering snowball  had got together  within a few miles of Selby house  set us down at the inner gate  there  in the outward hall  sat my blessed grandmamma  The moment I beheld her  my intended caution forsook me  I sprang by my aunt  and  before the foot step could be put down  flew  as it were  out of the coach  and threw myself at her feet  wrapping my arms about her  Bless  bless  said I  your Harriet  I could not at the moment  say another word   Great God  said the pious parent  her hands and eyes lifted up  Great God  I thank thee  Then folding her arms about my neck  she kissed my forehead  my check  my lips—God bless my Love  Pride of my life  the most precious of a hundred daughters  How does my Child—My Harriet—O my Love —After such dangers  such trials  such harassings—Once more  God be praised that I clasp to my 〈◊〉 heart  my Harriet   Separate them  separate them  said my facetious uncle  yet he had tears in his eyes  before they grow together —Madam  to my grandmamma  she is our Harriet  as well as yours  Let us welcome the saucy girl  on her re entrance into these doors —Saucy  I suppose  I shall soon find her     223 My grandmamma withdrew her fond arms  Take her  take her  said she  each in turn  But I think I never can part with her again   My uncle saluted me  and bid me very kindly welcome home  So did my aunt  So did Lucy—My equally beloved Nancy—So did every one   How can I return the obligations which the love of all my friends lays upon me  To be good  to be grateful  is not enough▪ ••uce that one ought to be for one s own sake  Wh•t a sweet thing is it to be beloved by worthy neighbours  I had several visiters last night  and compliments without number  on my arrival —Compliments  for what  For having lost the better half of my heart  Don t you think I look silly to myself  You bid me be free in my confessions  You promise to look my Letters over before you read them to any body  and to mark passages proper to be kept to yourself—Pray do   Mr  Greville and Mr  Fenwick were here separately  an hour ago  I thanked them for their civility on the road  and not ungraciously  as Mr  Greville told my uncle  as to him  He was not  he said  without hopes  yet  since I knew not how to be ungrateful  Mr  Greville builds  as he always did  a merit on his civility  and by that means sinks  in the narrower Lover  the claim he might otherwise make to the title of the generous neighbour   MISS ORME has just been here  She could not help throwing in a word for her brother   You will guess  my dear Lady G  at the subject of our conversations here  and what they will be  morning  noon  and night  for a week to come  My grandmamma is better in health than I have known her for a year or two past  The health of people in years can mend but slowly  and they are slow to acknowlege it in their own favour  My grandmamma  however  allows that she is better within these few   224 days past  but attributes the amendment to her Harriet s return   How do they all bless  revere  extol  your noble brother —How do they wish—And how do they regret—You know what—Yet how ready are they to applaud your Harriet  if she can hold her magnanimity  in preferring the happiness of Clementina to her own —My grandmamma and aunt are of opinion  that I should  and they praise me for the generosity of my effort  whether the superior merits of the man will or will not allow me to succeed in it  But my uncle  my Lucy  and my Nancy  from their unbounded love of me  think a little  and but a little  narrower  and  believing it will go hard with me  say  It is hard  My uncle  in particular  says the very pretension is slight and nonsense  But  however  if the girl  added he  can parade away her passion for an object so worthy  with all my heart  It will be but just  that the romancing evelations  which so often drive headstrong girls into difficulties  should now and then help a more discreet one out of them   Adieu  my beloved Lady G  Repeated compliments  love  thanks  to my Lord and Lady L  to my Emily  to Dr  Bartlett  to Mr  Beauchamp  and particularly to my Lord G  Dear
