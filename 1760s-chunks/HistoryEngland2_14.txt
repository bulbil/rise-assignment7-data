to provoke a quarrel  which the others endeavoured to evade  The citizens of London  at length  opened their eyes  they now saw the constitution effectually destroyed  they saw an oppressive parliament now subjected to a more oppressive army  they perceived their religion abolished  their King a captive  and their people exposed to the worst of slavery     35 In this exigence the common council assembled the militia of the city  the works were manned  and a manifesto published  aggravating the hostile intentions of the army  The house of commons was not less divided than the state  one part was for encouraging the citizens to proceed  while the rest  with the two speakers at their head  was for the army  The slightest divisions  in such a situation  are soon attended with violent consequences  The commons separated  the speakers  with sixty two members  quitted the house to seek protection from the army  while those who remained behind gave orders  and established laws  as if they had power to enforce obedience   Their assumed power  however  continued but a short time  for the army  with the speakers at their head  soon approached the city  Fear  therefore  compelled the common council to concur in measures which they tacitly disapproved  They opened their gates to the general  who  attended by the two speakers and the rest of the members  repaired to their respective habitations  The parliament  thus over awed  gave up the command of the Tower to general Fairfax  and ordered him the thanks of both houses for having disobeyed their commands   It still remained to dispose of the King  who had been sent prisoner to Hampton court  The Independants  at the head of whom was Cromwell  and the Presbyterians  in the name of either house  treated separately with him in private  he even had hopes that in these struggles for power he might be chosen mediator in the dispute  and expected that the state  at last  sensible of the miseries of anarchy  like a froward child  hushed by its own importunities  would settle under its former tranquil constitution  But he was soon undeceived  when he found the army and the generals maste… in the dispute  and when  as he had hitherto been used with some   36 degree of respect  upon their prevailing  he saw himself treated with very little deference or consideration  He therefore resolved to seek safety by flight  and  attended by two of his courtiers  fled from his confinement  and travelled on horseback all night to the sea side  in order to embark for France  leaving behind him a letter to both houses of parliament  His usual fortunes  however  still attended him here  no ship was in readiness at the place appointed  and he had no other method left  but to trust to the generosity of the Governor of the Isle of Wight for protection  Colonel Hammond was then in that command  a creature of Cromwell  who had been placed there by the interest of John Hampden  whom we have seen such an opposer of the King  His Majesty s attendants  whose names were Ashburnham and Berkeley  went to talk with the Governor upon this important occasion  who  instead of promising the protection required  only returned an evasive answer  and desired to be conducted to the King  Upon this all three went together to the house  where the unfortunate Monarch expected their arrival  but Hammond staid below  When Ashburnham informed his Majesty that Hammond was come to wait upon him  but that he had given no promise for protection  the King  who had now found almost all the world unfaithful  could not help crying out    O Jack  thou ha… undone me   Ashburnham burst into a shower of tears  and offered to kill Hammond that moment with his own hand  The humane Monarch would not permit this  Hammond was brought up  and the King being compelled to follow him to Carisbrook castle was once more made a prisoner  and treated by Hammond with only the outward appearances of respect     In the mean time the parliament continued every day to grow more feeble  and more factious  the army more powerful  and better united among each   37 other  Cromwell had taken every precaution to establish such a subordination among his troops  as was necessary to conduct them with ease  and invigorate his proceedings  But his views were in some danger of being controverted  at this juncture  by a new and unheard of confederacy  The Independants were for having no subordination in government  A set of men called Levellers now arose  who declared against any other governor than Christ  They declared that all degrees should be levelled  and an equality universally established in titles and estates  They presented several petitions  and carried their insolence to an immeasurable pitch  Cromwell at once saw that he was now upon the point of losing all the fruits of his former schemes and dangers  and dreaded this new faction still the more  as they turned his own pretended principles against himself  thus finding all at stake  he was resolved  by one resolute blow  to disperse the faction  or perish in the attempt  Having intimation that the Levellers were to
