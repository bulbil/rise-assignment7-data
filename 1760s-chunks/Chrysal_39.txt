 â€” oh  fie   It is a heinous crime   blood calls for blood    Your case is terrible           I feared so  father   but I depended on your tenderness  And   I did not think it reasonable that I should have aU the pleasure of   the crime  and you only the trouble of forgiving   I stripped her   of these jewels  which give me leave to offer you          You are a prudent man  my son   I thought you would act with   discretion  I accept the jewels  as a peace offering to the Holy   Church for your sins   and as the value of them â€”  indeed  they are   costly gems â€” proves the sincerity of your repentance  I shall not   hesitate to pronounce your sins forgiven          For  though adultery is a great sin â€¢   and in this case aggravated   by rape and incest  yet  as you say  it was not because she was the   wife of another man  and especially your brother  that you desired   to enjoy her  but merely as she was a beautiful woman  therefore   the adultery and incest comes in but by accident  And then  as   you ravished her only because she would not comply  the sin of   the rape is certainly hers  as I said before   for if I force a man   to commit a crime  I am guilty of that crime  and not he  And   again  though murder is a most heinous sin  yet as you killed her   not merely to indulge a murderous intent  but to prevent her       See the casuiBtical divinity of the Jesuits  throughout          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 23     discoyering your having forced her  and so mining you  the intention   quite alters the nature of the fact  and makes it but self preservation    which is the first law of nature  And lastly  as you took the jewels    not with a design to rob her  but to ofier them to j e Church  and   accordingly have brought them  that conclusion sanctifies the   whole action  and makes your peace with Heaven        For know  my son  that crimes which respect man only  as in   your case  rape  adultery  incest  murder  and robbery  though   bad in themselves   tis true  yet are a pleasure to the Church to   forgive to a faithful and penitent son  who believes all her doctrines   and pays due obedience to her clergy  the vicegerents of God on   earth  the receivers of her revenues  and dispensers of her favours   and vengeance   to whom all earthly power is subservient  who   are the kings of kings  and lords of the world  This  my son  is the    jioctrine of our Holy Church  as delivered by the most learned     fathers of our Order  in the belief of which you will be safe from   aU the powers of hell  Do what you will  while you pay faith and   obedience to the Church  she will pardon all your sins        When he had concluded his instructions with this pious exhorta    tion  and sealed his absolution with a blessing  the purified saint   arose and said     Holy father  thou hast set my soul at ease with   regard to hereafter  but still I fear for this world  It unfortunately   happened that I was seen in the fact by a servant who escaped me    or I should have charmed her silence too   and now I apprehend   she will inform my brother          This is unlucky  most unlucky    replied the priest     I know   not what to advise   I am utterly at a loss  If you should prevent   her malice  and accuse her of the fact          Oh  but father  the rape   There may be appearances of that   which would disprove my charge against a woman         Mistake me not  my son   I do not advise any such thing    Heaven forbid that I should advise to bear false witness against   an innocent life   I am utterly at a loss          Suppose  father  I should stiU strive to prevent my fears by   taking off my brother  as I caimot find her  this is the only way   to make me easy  Ha  father  is not that an happy thought   I   wish it had occurred
