 while he thus changed from one pleasure to another  it was requisite to find out a minister and favourite  who would take care of the kingdom  Indifferent Princes ever attempt to rule  and are ruled by favourites  and soon a proper person was found to answer the King s intentions in this particular  the man I mean was the famous Cardinal Wolsey  and  as a great part of this reign was ruled by him  his history may  with propriety  make a part in that of his master  Thomas Wolsey was the son of a private gentleman  and not of a butcher  as is commonly reported  in Ipswich  he was sent to Oxford so early  that he was a bachelor at fourteen  and from that time called the boy bachelor  He rose  by degrees  upon quitting college  from one preferment to another  till he was made rector of Lymington by the Marquis of Dorset  whose children he had instructed  He had not long resided 〈◊〉 this living  when one of the justices of the peace put him in the stocks  for being drunk and raising disturbances in a neighbouring air  This disgrace  however  did not retard his promotion  he rose  by degrees  till he was  at last  entrusted with negotiating an intended marriage between Henry VII  and Margaret of Savoy  His dispatch  upon that occasion  procured him the deanery of Lincoln  and in this situation it was that Henry VIII  pitched upon him as a favourite  and entrusted him with the administration of affairs  Presently after his being   229 introduced at court he was made a Privy Counsellor  and  as such  had an opportunity of ingratiating himself with the King  who found him at once submissive and enterprizing  Wolsey sung  laughed  danced  with every libertine of the court  and his house was the scene of all the King s criminal pleasures and amours  To such a weak and vicious Monarch as Henry  qualities of this nature were highly pleasing  and Wolsey was made his Prime Minister  and managed the whole kingdom at his pleasure  The people saw  with indignation  the new favourite s mean condescensions to the King  and his arrogance to themselves  They had long regarded the vicious insolence and unbecoming splendor of the clergy with envy and detestation  and Wolsey s greatness served to bring a new odium upon that body  already too much the object of the people s dislike   Wolsey had some talents as a minister  but his failings outbalanced them  being excessively revengeful  ambitious  and intolerably proud  Among other instances of his ambition  he aspired at the Popedom  Ferdinand  who was then Emperor of Germany  promised him his interest to procure it  and this consequently attached the English minister more closely to the Emperor  this Monarch was then at war with France  and each power solicited the alliance of England  It was the interest of the English calmly to look on as spectators of the quarrel  and suffer its rivals in power to grow weak by their mutual animosity  Wolsey  however  preferring his own interest to that of his country or his master  engaged in a league against France  Soon after  however  the Pope dying  and the Emperor failing in his promise  Wolsey    230 in revenge  induced his master to change sides  and assist France against Ferdinand   A victory over the Scots  rather ostentatious than useful  served  in some measure  to repress the discontents of the people during this mal administration of the ecclesiastical favourite  this victory was obtained by the Earl of Surrey over James IV  of Scotland  it was fought at Flodden Field  and the Scots lost  upon this occasion  the flower of their nobility and gentry  and James  their King  was slain in batttle   Success ever serves to stop the murmurings of the English  and no nation can better endure to be splendidly miserable  Wolsey now became a Cardinal  grew every day more powerful  and more desirous of power  the Pope was sensible of his influence over the King  and therefore created him his legate in England  The Pontiff s design was to make him thus instrumental in draining the kingdom of money  upon pretence of employing it in a war against the Turks  but  in reality  to fill his own coffers  In this he so well served the court of Rome  that he  some time after  made him legate for life  he was now  therefore  at once a Legate  a Cardinal  a Bishop  a Prime Minister  and possessed of numberless church benefices  yet  still unsatisfied  he desired greater promotions  He therefore procured a bull from the Pope  impowering him to make Knights and Counts  to legitimate bastards  to give degrees in arts  law  physic  and divinity  and grant all sorts of dispensations  So much pride and power could not avoid giving high offence to the nobility  yet none dared to vent their indignation  so greatly were they in terror of his vindictive temper  The Duke of Buckingham  son of him who lost   231 his life in the reign of Richard III  was the only person who had resolution enough to complain
