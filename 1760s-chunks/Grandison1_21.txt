your time  if he can have you at his  I love your noble frankness  Then such sweetness of countenance  sitting down  and audibly whispering  and jogging my cousin with his elbow  such dove like eyes  daring to tell all that is in the honest heart —I am a physiognomist  madam  raising his voice to me   Ad s my life  you are a perfect paragon  Say you will encourage my boy  or you ll be worse off  for  standing up again  I will come and court you myself  A good estate gives   47 a man confidence  and  when I set about it—Hum — one hand stuck in his side  flourishing with the other  no woman yet  I do assure you —ever won my heart as you have done   O  Sir Rowland  I thought you were too wise to be swayed by first impressions  None but the giddy  you know  love at first sight   Admirable  admirable indeed  I knew you had wit at will  and I am sure you have wisdom  Know you  Ladies  that wit and wisdom are two different things  and are very rarely seen together  Plain man  as I appear to be  looking on himself first on one side  then on the other  and unbuttoning his coat two buttons to let a gold braid appear upon his waistcoat  I can tell ye  I have not lived all this time for nothing  I am considered in Wales—Hem —But I will not praise myself —Ad s my life  how do this young Lady s perfections run me all into tongue —But I see you all respect her as well as I  so I need not make apology to the rest of you young Ladies  for the distinction paid to her  I wish I had as many nephews as there are Ladies of ye disengaged  By Mercy  we would be all of kin   Thank you  Sir Rowland  said each of the young Ladies  smiling  and diverted at his oddity   But as to my observation  continued the knight  that none but the giddy love at first sight  There is no general rule  without exception  you know  Every man must love you at first sight  Do I not love you myself  and yet never did I see you before  nor any body like you   You know not what you do  Sir Rowland  to raise thus the vanity of a poor girl  How may you make conceit and pride run away with her  till she become contemptible for both in the eye of every person whose good opinion is worth cultivating   Ad s my life  that s prettily said  But let me tell you  that the she who can give this caution in the   48 midst of her praisings  can be in no danger of being run away with by her vanity  Why  madam  you extort praises from me  I never ran on so glibly in praise of mortal woman before  You must cease to look  to smile  to speak  I can toll you  if you would have me cease to praise you    Tis well you are not a young man  Sir Rowland  said Miss Allestree  You seem to have the art of engaging a woman s attention  You seem to know how to turn her own artillery against her  and as your sex generally do  exalt her in courtship  that you may have it in your power to abase her afterwards   Why  madam  I must own  that we men live to sixty  before we know how to deal with you Ladies  or with the world either  and then we are not fit to engage with the one  and are ready to quit the other  An old head upon a young pair of shoulders would make rare work among ye  But to the main point  looking very kindly on me  I ask no questions about you  madam  Fortune is not to be mentioned  I want you not to have any  Not that the Lady is the worse for having a fortune  And a man may stand a chance for as good a wife among those who have fortunes  as among those who have none  I adore you for your frankness of heart  Be all of a piece now  I beseech you  You are disengaged  you say  Will you admit of a visit from my nephew  My boy may be bashful  True Love is always modest and diffident  You don t look as if you would dislike a man for being modest  And I will come along with him myself   And then the old knight look d important  as one who  if he lent his head to his nephew s shoulders  had no doubt of succeeding   What  Sir Rowland  admit of a visit from your nephew  in order to engage him in a three years courtship  I have told you that I intend not to marry till I am twenty four     49 Twenty four  I must own  is the age of marriage I should choose for a Lady  and for the reasons aforesaid —But  now I think of it  I did not tell you
