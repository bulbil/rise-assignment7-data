ridiculous  so unreasonable was my tyrant in his spleen  that he  declared he would even be jealous of Heydigger  if there was no other  man to incur his suspicion  he expected that I should spend my whole  time with him tete a tete  when I sacrificed my enjoyment to these  comfortable parties  he never failed to lay hold on some innocent  expression of mine  which he made the foundation of a quarrel  and  when  I strove to avoid these disagreeable misinterpretations by reading or  writing  he incessantly teased and tormented me with the imputation of  being peevish  sullen  and reserved    Harassed by this insufferable behaviour  I communicated my case to  Dr  S   and his lady  intimating that I neither could nor would expose  myself any longer to such usage  The doctor exhorted me to bear my fate  with patience  and Mrs  S   was silent on the subject  so that I still  hesitated between staying and going  when the doctor  being one night at  supper  happened to have some words with my lord  who was so violently  transported with passion  that I was actually afraid of going to  bed with him  and next morning  when he awakened  there was such an  expression of frantic wildness in his countenance  that I imagined he  was actually distracted    This alarming circumstance confirmed me in my resolution of decamping   and I accordingly moved my quarters to a house in Sackville street   where I had lodged when I was a widow  From thence I sent a message  to the duke of L    desiring he would make my lord acquainted with the  place of my abode  my reasons for removing  and my intention to defend  myself against all his attempts  The first night of this separation I  went to bed by myself with as much pleasure as a man would feel in going  to bed to his mistress whom he had long solicited in vain  so rejoiced  was I to be delivered from my obnoxious bedfellow     6 22 15  3 45 PM    From these lodgings I soon moved to Brook street  where I had not long  enjoyed the sweets of my escape  when I was importuned to return  by a  new steward whom my lord had engaged in the room of H    This gentleman   who bore a very fair character  made such judicious representations  and  behaved so candidly in the discharge of his function  that I agreed  he should act as umpire in the difference betwixt us  and once more  a reconciliation was effected  though his lordship began to be  dissatisfied even before the execution of our agreement  in consequence  of which he attended me to Bath  whither I went for the benefit of my  health  which was not a little impaired    This accommodation had a surprising effect upon my lover  who   notwithstanding his repeated declarations  that no woman should ever  gain such an ascendancy over his heart as to be able to give him pain   suffered all the agonies of disappointed love  when he now found himself  deprived of the opportunities of seeing me  and behaved very differently  from what he had imagined he should  His words and actions were  desperate  one of his expressions to me was   It is like twisting my  heart strings  and tearing it out of my body   Indeed  I never should  have acted this part had I foreseen what he would have suffered  but  I protest I believed him  when he said otherwise  so much  that his  declaration on that subject was the occasion of my giving him up  and it  was now too late to retract    In our expedition to Bath  I was accompanied by a very agreeable young  lady  with whom I passed my time very happily  amid the diversions of  the place  which screened me  in a good measure  from the vexatious  society of my hopeful partner  From this place we repaired to his seat  in the country  where we spent a few months  and thence returned again  to our house in Bond street  Here  while I was confined to my bed by  illness  it was supposed my indisposition was no other than a private  lying in  though I was under the roof with my lord  and attended by his  servants    While the distemper continued  my lord  to do him justice  behaved with  all imaginable tenderness and care  and his concern on these occasions I  have already mentioned as a strange inconsistency in his disposition   If his actions were at all accountable  I should think he took pains to  fret me into a fever first  in order to manifest his love and humanity  afterwards  When I recovered my strength and spirits  I went abroad   saw company  and should have been easy  had he been contented  but as  my satisfaction increased  his good humour decayed  and he banished from  his house  one by one  all the people whose
