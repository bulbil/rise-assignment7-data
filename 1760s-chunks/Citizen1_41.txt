 which  to many  appear insignificant  that he is at last enabled to form general conclusions  this  therefore  must be my excuse for sending so far as China accounts of manners and follies  which  though minute in their own nature  serve more truly to characterise this people than histories of their public treaties  courts  ministers  negotiations  and ambassadors  Adieu   LETTER XXX  From the same   THE English have not yet brought the art of gardening to the same perfection with the Chinese  but have lately begun to imitate them  nature is now followed with greater assiduity than   127 formerly  the trees are suffered to shoot out into the utmost luxuriance  the streams  no longer forced from their native beds  are permitted to wind along the vallies  spontaneous flowers take place of the finished parterre  and the enamelled meadow of the shaven green   Yet still the English are far behind us in this charming art  their designers have not yet attained a power of uniting instruction with beauty  An European will scarcely conceive my meaning  when I say that there is scarce a garden in China which does not contain some fine moral  couch d under the general design  where one is not taught wisdom as he walks  and feels the force of some noble truth  or delicate precept resulting from the disposition of the groves  streams or grotto s  Permit me to illustrate what I mean by a description of my gardens at Quamsi  My heart still hovers round those scenes of former happiness with pleasure  and I find satisfaction in enjoying them at this distance  though but in imagination   You descended from the house between two groves of trees  planted in such a manner  that they were impenetrable to the eye  while on each hand the way was adorned with all that was beautiful in porcelaine  statuary  and painting  This passage from the house opened into an area surrounded with rocks  flowers  trees and shrubs  but all so disposed as if each was the spontaneous production of nature  As you proceeded forward on this lawn  to your right and left hand were two gates  opposite each other  of very different   128 architecture and design  and before you lay a temple built rather with minute elegance than ostentation   The right hand gate was planned with the utmost simplicity  or rather rudeness  ivy clasp d round the pillars  the baleful cyprus hung over it  time seemed to have destroyed all the smoothness and regularity of the stone  two champions with lifted clubs appeared in the act of guarding its access  dragons and serpents were seen in the most hideous attitudes  to deter the spectator from approaching  and the perspective view that lay behind seemed dark and gloomy to the last degree  the stranger was tempted to enter only from the motto  PERVIA VIRTUTI   The opposite gate was formed in a very different manner  the architecture was light  elegant  and inviting  flowers hung in wreaths round the pillars  all was finished in the most exact and masterly manner  the very stone of which it was built still preserved its polish  nymphs  wrought by the hand of a master  in the most alluring attitudes  beckoned the stranger to approach  while all that lay behind  as far as the eye could reach  seemed gay  luxuriant  and capable of affording endless pleasure  The motto itself contributed to invite him  for over the gate was written these words  FACILIS DESCENSUS   By this time I fancy you begin to perceive that the gloomy gate was designed to represent the road to virtue  the opposite  the more agreeable passage to vice  It is but natural to suppose  that   129 the spectator was always tempted to enter by the gate which offered him so many allurements  I always in these cases left him to his choice  but generally found that he took to the left  which promised most entertainment   Immediately upon his entering the gate of vice  the trees and flowers were disposed in such a manner as to make the most pleasing impression  but as he walked farther on he insensibly found the garden assume the air of a wilderness  the landskips began to darken  the paths grew more intricate  he appeared to go downwards  frightful rocks seemed to hang over his head  gloomy caverns  unexpected precipices  awful ruins  heaps of unburied bones  and terrifying sounds  caused by unseen waters  began to take place of what at first appeared so lovely  it was in vain to attempt returning  the labyrinth was too much perplexed for any but myself to find the way back  In short  when sufficiently impressed with the horrors of what he saw  and the imprudence of his choice  I brought him by an hidden door  a shorter way back into the area from whence at first he had strayed   The gloomy gate now presented itself before the stranger  and though there seemed little in its appearance to tempt his curiosity  yet encouraged by the motto  he generally proceeded  The darkness of the entrance  the frightful figures that seemed to obstruct his way  the trees of a mournful green  conspired at first to disgust him  as he went forward  however  all began
