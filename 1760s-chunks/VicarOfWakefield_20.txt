too old  In the mean time  my neighbour and I looked on  laughed at every feat  and praised our own dexterity when we were young  Hot cockles succeeded next  questions and commands followed that  and last of all  they sate down to hunt the slipper  As every person may not be acquainted with this primaeval pastime  it may be necessary to observe  that the company at this play plant themselves in a ring upon the ground  all  except one who stands in the middle  whose business it is to catch a shoe  which the company shove about under their hams from one to another  something like a weaver s shuttle  As it is impossible  in this case  for the lady who  Page  101  is up to face all the company at once  the great beauty of the play lies in hitting her a thump with the heel of the shoe on that side least capable of making a defence  It was in this manner that my eldest daughter was hemmed in  and thumped about  all blowzed  in spirits  and bawling for fair play  fair play  with a voice that might deafen a ballad singer  when confusion on confusion  who should enter the room but our two great acquaintances from town  Lady Blarney and Miss Carolina Wilelmina Amelia Skeggs  Description would but beggar  therefore it is unnecessary to describe this new mortification Death  To be seen by ladies of such high breeding in such vulgar attitudes   Nothing better could ensue from such a vulgar play of Mr  Flamborough s proposing  We seemed stuck to the ground for some time  as if actually petrified with amazement   The two ladies had been at our house to see us  and finding us from home  came after us hither  as they were uneasy to know  Page  102  what accident could have kept us from church the day before  Olivia undertook to be our prolocutor  and delivered the whole in a summary way  only saying    We were thrown from our horses    At which account the ladies were greatly concerned  but being told the family received no hurt  they were extremely glad  but being informed that we were almost killed by the fright  they were vastly sorry  but hearing that we had a very good night  they were extremely glad again  Nothing could exceed their complaisance to my daughters  their professions the last evening were warm  but now they were ardent  They protested a desire of having a more lasting acquaintance  Lady Blarney was particularly attached to Olivia  Miss Carolina Wilelmina Amelia Skeggs  I love to give the whole name  took a greater fancy to her sister  They supported the conversation between themselves  while my daughters sate silent  admiring their exalted breeding  But as every reader  however beggarly himself  is  Page  103  fond of high lived dialogues  with anecdotes of Lords  Ladies  and Knights of the Garter  I must beg leave to give him the concluding part of the present conversation        All that I know of the matter    cried Miss Skeggs    is this  that it may be true  or it may not be true  but this I can assure your Ladyship  that the whole rout was in amaze  his Lordship turned all manner of colours  my Lady fell into a swoon  but Sir Tomkyn  drawing his sword  swore he was her s to the last drop of his blood         Well    replied our Peeress    this I can say  that the Dutchess never told me a syllable of the matter  and I believe her Grace would keep nothing a secret from me  But this you may depend upon as fact  that the next morning my Lord Duke cried out three times to his valet de chambre  Jernigan  Jernigan  Jernigan  bring me my garters      Page  104  But previously I should have mentioned the very impolite behaviour of Mr  Burchell  who  during this discourse  sate with his face turned to the fire  and at the conclusion of every sentence would cry out fudge  an expression which displeased us all  and in some measure damped the rising spirit of the conversation      Besides  my dear Skeggs    continued our Peeress   there is nothing of this in the copy of verses that Dr  Burdock made upon the occasion         I am surprised at that    cried Miss Skeggs    for he seldom leaves any thing out  as he writes only for his own amusement  But can your Ladyship favour me with a sight of them         My dear creature    replied our Peeress    do you think I carry such things about me  Though they are very fine to be sure  and I think myself something of a judge  at least I know what pleases myself   Page  105  Indeed I was ever an admirer of all Doctor Burdock s little pieces  for except what he does  and our dear Countess at Hanover Square  there s nothing comes out but the most
