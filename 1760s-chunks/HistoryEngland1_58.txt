the woman to make her a philtre  to secure the affections of the Duke her husband  Neither their innocence  nor her rank  could protect them  she was condemned to penance and perpetual imprisonment  Bolingbroke was hanged  and the woman burnt in Smithfield   Henry  during these contests of his ministers  was  at first  from age  incapable of conducting the reins of government  and  when he became adult  he was equally incapable  from ignorance and imbecillity  Whether it was that his governors had kept him in ignorance  in order to prolong their own power  or whether he was naturally weak  history does not clearly determine  The Earl of Suffolk  one of those who shared the power at that time  thought the best way of managing the King would be to marry him to a woman who was herself capable of reigning alone  He had still another motive  which was to create a new power to oppose the Duke of Gloucester  who was his enemy  and an obstacle in the road to his ambition  to this purpose  he fixed upon Margaret of Anjou  daughter of Rene  King of Sicily  and niece of the King of France  She was a Princess of uncommon resolution  and great penetration  but entirely without fortune  for which  it was said  her other good qualities were sufficient to atone  This match the Duke of Gloucester vainly opposed  the match went forward  and the new Queen shewed her resentment  by proving herself a formidable enemy  willing and able to undo him     171 She first began her reign  therefore  with removing him from the council board  To palliate this proceeding  persons were suborned to accuse him of cruelty and injustice  to these accusations he pleaded his innocence  with such force of evidence  that the council  though consisting of his enemies  were obliged to acquit him  Still  however  the Queen  bent upon his ruin  ordered him to be apprehended  and accused before the parliament  summoned for this purpose  As the people thought him innocent  it was expected he would come off now as he had before  but  on the day he was to make his defence  he was found dead in his bed  though without any signs of violence upon his body   This violence rendered the Queen and the King equally odious  the Queen especially was charged with the murder  and the dignity of her station only served to render her a more conspicuous object of reproach  But what still contributed to render the people discontented with the administration  was the indifferent success of their arms in France  Triumphs and conquests were ever a means of repressing the discontents of the people  but the present government  to their quarrels at home  added the misfortune of being defeated abroad   Upon the death of Henry V  the Dauphin of France asserted his claim to the throne of that kingdom  under the title of Charles VII  Nothing could be more deplorable than his situation  upon coming to the crown  of which he was only the nominal possessor  the English were masters of almost all France  Henry VI  was solemnly invested with regal power  by legates from Paris  The Duke of Bedford  with a numerous army   172 in the heart of the kingdom  confirmed his claim  and the Duke of Burgundy was steady in the English alliance  Wherever Charles attempted to face the enemy  he was overthrown  he could scarcely rely on the friends next his person  and his authority was insulted  even by his own servants  In this situation  nothing but miraculous assistance  or pretended miracles  could save him  To the last expedient he had recourse  and it fully answered his intentions  the French  from a vanquished nation  are suddenly going to be victorious  and the English  who had been hitherto deemed invincible   are going to be every where worsted  and  at length  totally driven out of the kingdom   A gentleman  on the frontiers of Lorrain  whose name was Baudricourt  was the person who first resolved to put this happy imposture into practice  He fixed upon the servant maid of an inn for this purpose  and she was instructed at once to perform the duties of a warrior and a prophetess  this was Joan of Arc  the renowned maid of Orleans  a woman of masculine strength and courage  pretending to be but eighteen  but  in reality  twenty seven years old  She equipped herself in the arms and habit of a man  and it was given out  that she was inspired  she was brought before the King  examined by the Doctors of the University  and they  either deceived  or willing to assist the imposture  affirmed that her commission was from heaven  The vulgar  as ready to give credit to inspiration as to witchcraft  easily came into the imposture  and acquired new hopes and confidence of success   The English were  at that time  besieging the city of Orleans  Charles s last resource  and were   173 upon the point of becoming masters of it  Joan undertook to raise the siege  and  to render herself the more remarkable  ordered a sword to be brought
