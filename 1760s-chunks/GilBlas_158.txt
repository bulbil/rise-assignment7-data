throat rascals  from whom you have rescued me  professes to be in love with my daughter  He asked her of me in marriage within these few days  and for want of gaining my consent in a quiet way  has just attempted to force himself into my daughter s good graces  by sending me into the other world  And may we take the liberty  rejoined I  of inquiring farther  why you were so obdurate to the proposals of this enamoured swain  I will explain the whole to you at once  said he  I had a brother  a merchant in this town  his name was Austin  Two months ago he happened to be at Calatrava  and took up his abode with his correspondent  Juan Velez de la Membrilla  They got to be as loving as turtles  and my brother  to clench the connection  engaged my daughter Florence to his good friend s son  not doubting but he had influence enough with me to redeem his pledge when he returned to Merida  Accordingly  he no sooner opened himself on the subject than I consented out of pure fraternal affection  He sent Florence s picture to Calatrava  but  alas  he did not live to put the finishing hand to his own work  We laid him with his forefathers three weeks ago  On his death bed  he besought me not to dispose of my girl but in favour of his correspondent s son  I satisfied his mind on that point  and this is the reason why I have refused Florence to the suitor by whom I was assaulted  though the match would have been a very desirable one  But my word is my idol  and we are in daily expectation of Juan Velez de la Membrilla s heir  who is to be my son in law  though I know no more of him  nor of his father neither  than if they were just imported from an undiscovered island  But I beg pardon  this is an old man s garrulity  Yet you yourselves led me into the scrape   This tale did I swallow with a greedy ear  and pouncing at once upon a part to play  which my fruitful imagination suggested  I put on an air of inordinate surprise  and ventured at all hazards to lift my eyes upward to a purer region  Then turning to my father in law  with an expression of feeling which nothing but hypocrisy could personate  Ah  Signor de Moyadas  is it possible that  on my arrival at Merida  I should enjoy the heartfelt triumph of rescuing from foul assassination the honoured parent of my peerless love  This exclamation produced all the astonishment it was levelled to excite in the old citizen  Even Moralez himself stared like an honest man  and shewed by his face that there was a degree of impudence to which his conceptions had not hitherto risen  What  do not my ears deceive me  exclaimed the old gentleman  And are you really the son of my brother s correspondent  Really and truly  Signor Jerome de Moyadas  rejoined I with impregnable effrontery  and a hug round his neck that had nearly sent him after his brother  Behold the selected mortal of his species  to whose arms the adorable Florence is devoted  But these nuptial anticipations  transporting as they are  must yield to the anguish of my soul for the demise of their founder  Poor Austin  He is gone  and we must all follow  I should be ingratitude personified  if my heart was not lacerated and rent by the death of a man to whom I owe all my hopes of bliss  At the term of this period  I squeezed good Jerome s wezand once more  and drew the back of my hand across my eyes  to wipe away the tears it had not been convenient to shed  Moralez  who by this time had conned over the pretty pickings to be made out of this juggle  was not wanting to play his underpart  He passed himself off for my servant  and improved upon his master in lamentation for the untimely death of Signor Austin  My honoured master Jerome  exclaimed he  what a loss have you sustained  since your brother is no more  He was such an honest man  Honest men are not to be met with every day  A superfine sample of commerce  A dealer in friendship without a percentage  A dealer in merchandise without an underhand advantage  A dealer who dealt as dealers very seldom do deal   We had our hands to play against a man who was a novice at the game  Simple and cullible  so far from smelling out the rat  he took his stink for a nosegay  And why  said he  did you not come straight to my house  It was not friendly to put up at an inn  On the footing we are likely to be upon  there should be none of those punctilios  Sir  said Moralez  helping me out of the scrape  my master is a little too much given to stand upon ceremony  Though to be sure  in the present instance  he is in some degree excusable for declining to appear before in this uncouth trim  We have been robbed upon the road  and have lost all our travelling equipage  My lad  interrupted I
