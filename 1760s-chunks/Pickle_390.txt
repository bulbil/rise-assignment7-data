 He mentioned Sophy in the  most respectful terms  spoke of Emilia with the most reverential awe   as the object of his inviolable love and veneration  but disclaimed  all hope of ever more attracting her regard  and excused himself from  profiting by Godfrey s kind intention  declaring  with a resolute  air  that he had broken off all connection with mankind  and that he  impatiently longed for the hour of his dissolution  which  if it should  not soon arrive by the course of nature  he was resolved to hasten  with his own hands  rather than be exposed to the contempt  and more  intolerable pity  of a rascally world     6 22 15  3 45 PM   Gauntlet argued against this frantic determination with all the  vehemence of expostulating friendship  but his remonstrances did not  produce the desired effect upon our desperate hero  who calmly refuted  all his arguments  and asserted the rectitude of his design from the  pretended maxims of reason and true philosophy  While this dispute was  carried on with eagerness on one side  and deliberation on the other  a  letter was brought to Peregrine  who threw it carelessly aside unopened   though the superscription was in a handwriting to which he was a  stranger  and  in all probability  the contents would never have been  perused  had not Gauntlet insisted upon his waiving all ceremony  and  reading it forthwith  Thus solicited  Pickle unsealed the billet  which   to his no small surprise  contained the following intimation          Sir   This comes to inform you  that  after many dangers       and disappointments  I am  by the blessing of God  safely       arrived in the Downs  on board of the Gomberoon Indiaman        having made a tolerable voyage  by which I hope I shall be       enabled to repay  with interest  the seven hundred pounds       which I borrowed of you before my departure from England        I take this opportunity of writing by our purser  who goes       express with despatches for the Company  that you may have       this satisfactory notice as soon as possible  relating to       one whom I suppose you have long given over as lost  I have       enclosed it in a letter to my broker  who  I hope  knows       your address  and will forward it accordingly  And I am        with respect  Sir  your most humble servant                                             Benjamin Chintz    He had no sooner taken a cursory view of this agreeable epistle  than  his countenance cleared up  and  reaching it to his friend  with a  smile   There   said he   is a more convincing argument  on your side  of the question  than all the casuists in the universe can advance    Gauntlet  wondering at this observation  took the paper  and  casting  his eyes greedily upon the contents  congratulated him upon the receipt  of it  with extravagant demonstrations of joy   Not on account of the  sum   said he   which  upon my honour  I would with pleasure pay three  times over for your convenience and satisfaction  but because it seems  to have reconciled you to life  and disposed your mind for enjoying the  comforts of society    The instantaneous effect which this unexpected smile of fortune produced  in the appearance of our adventurer is altogether inconceivable  it  plumped up his cheeks in a moment  unbended and enlightened every  feature of his face  elevated his head  which had begun to sink as  it were  between his shoulders  and from a squeaking dispirited tone   swelled up his voice to a clear manly accent  Godfrey  taking advantage  of this favourable change  began to regale him with prospects of future  success  He reminded him of his youth and qualifications  which were  certainly designed for better days than those he had as yet seen   he pointed out various paths by which he might arrive at wealth and  reputation  he importuned him to accept of a sum for his immediate  occasions  and earnestly begged that he would allow him to discharge  the debt for which he was confined  observing  that Sophy s fortune  had enabled him to exhibit that proof of his gratitude  without any  detriment to his affairs  and protesting that he should not believe  himself in possession of Mr  Pickle s esteem  unless he was permitted to    6 22 15  3 45 PM   make some such return of good will to the man  who
