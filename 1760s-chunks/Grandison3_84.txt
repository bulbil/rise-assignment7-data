 owing their very being to profligate principles  have no family honour to support  no fair example to imitate  but must be warned by their father  when bitter experience  as convinced him of his errors  to avoid the paths in which he has trod   How delightful the domestic connexion  To bring to the paternal and fraternal dwellings  a sister  a daughter  that shall be received there with tender love  to strengthen your own interest in the world by alliance with some noble and worthy family  who shall rejoice to trust to the Barone della Porretta the darling of their hopes—This would  to a generous heart  like yours  be the source of infinite delights    207 But could you now think of introducing to the friends you revere  the unhappy objects of a vagrant affection  Must not my Jeronymo even estrange himself from his home  to conceal from his father  from his mother  from his sister  persons shut out by all the laws of honour from their society  The persons  so shut out  must hate the family to whose interests theirs are so contrary  What sincere union then  what sameness of affection  between Jeronymo and the objects of his passion   But the present hour dances delightfully away  and my friend will not look beyond it  His gay companions applaud and compliment him on his triumphs  In general  perhaps  he allows     that the welfare and order of society ought to be maintained by submission to Divine and human laws  but his single exception for himself can be of no importance    Of what  then  is general practice made up  If every one excepts himself  and offends in the instance that best suits his inclination  what a scene of horror will this world become  Affluence and a gay disposition tempt to licencious pleasures  penury and a gloomy one to robbery  revenge  and murder  Not one enormity will be without its plea  if once the boundaries of duty are thrown down  But  even in this universal depravity  would not his crime be much worse  who robbed me of my child from riot and licentiousness  and under a guise of love and trust  than his who despoiled me of my substance  and had necessity to plead in extenuation of his guilt     I cannot doubt  my dear friend  but you will take  at l•ast kindly  these expostulations  tho  some of them are upon subjects on which our conversations have been hitherto ineffectual  I submit them to your consideration  I can have no interest in making them  nor motive  but what proceeds from that true friendship with which I desire to be thought  Most affectionately Yours     208 You have heard  my good Miss Byron  that the friendship between Mr  Grandison and Signor Jeronymo was twice broken off  Once it was  by the unkindly taken freedom of the expostulatory Letter  Jeronymo  at that time of his life  ill brooked opposition in any pursuit his heart was engaged in  When pushed  he was vehement  and Mr  Grandison could not be over solicitous to keep up a friendship with a young man who was under the dominion of his dissolute companions  and who would not allow of remonstrances  in cases that concerned his morals   Jeronymo  having afterwards been drawn into great inconveniencies by his libertine friends  broke with them  and Mr  Grandison and he meeting by accident at Padua  their friendship  at the pressing instances of Jeronymo  was again renewed   Jeronymo thought himself reformed  Mr  Grandison hoped he was  But  soon after  a temptation fell in his way  which he could not resist  It was from a Lady who was more noted for her birth  beauty  and fortune  than for her virtue  She had spread her snares for Mr  Grandison before Jeronymo became acquainted with her  and revenge for her slighted advances taking possession of her heart  she hoped an opportunity would be afforded her of wreaking it upon him   The occasion was given by the following Letter  which Mr  Grandison thought himself obliged  in honour  to write to his friend  on his attachment  the one being then at Padua  the other at Cremona   I AM extremely concerned  my dear Jeronymo  at your new engagement with a Lady  who  tho  of family and fortune  has shewn but little regard to her character  How frail are the resolutions of men  How much in the power of women  But I will not recriminate—Yet I cannot but regret  that I must lose your company in our projected visits to the German   209 courts  This  however  more for your sake than my own  since to the principal of them I am no stranger  You have excused yourself to me  I wish you had a better motive  But I write rather to warn than to upbraid you  This Lady is mistress of all the arts of woman  She may glory in her conquest  you ought not to be proud of yours  You will not  when you know her better  I have had a singular opportunity of being acquainted with her character  I never judged of characters  of womens especially
