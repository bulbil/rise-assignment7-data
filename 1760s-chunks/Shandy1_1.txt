  THE LIFE AND OPINIONS OF TRISTRAM SHANDY →   GENTLEMAN   〈 in non Latin alphabet 〉  〈 in non Latin alphabet 〉  VOL  I   The SECOND EDITION   LONDON  Printed for R  and J  DODSLEY in Pall Mall  M DCC LX     To the Right Honourable Mr  PITT   SIR   NEVER poor Wight of a Dedicator had less hopes from his Dedication  than I have from this of mine  for it is written in a bye corner of the kingdom  and in a retired thatch d house  where I live in a constant endeavour to fence against the infirmities of ill health  and other evils of lise  by    mirth  being firmly persuaded that every time a man smiles —but much more so  when he laughs  that it adds something to this Fragment of Life   I humbly beg  Sir  that you will honour this book by taking it— not under your Protection —it must protect itself  but —into the country with you  where  if I am ever told  it has made you smile  or can conceive it has beguiled you of one moment s pain—I shall think myself as happy as a minister of state —perhaps much happier than any    one  one only excepted  that I have ever read or heard of   I am  great Sir   and what is more to your Honour   I am  good Sir   Your Well wisher  and most humble Fellow Subject  THE AUTHOR     THE LIFE and OPINIONS OF TRISTRAM SHANDY →   Gent   CHAP  I   I Wish either my father or my mother  or indeed both of them  as they were in duty both equally bound to it  had minded what they were about when they begot me  had they duly consider d how much depended upon what they were then doing —that not only the production of a rational Being was concern d in it  but that possibly the happy formation and temperature of his body   Page  2  perhaps his genius and the very cast of his mind —and  for aught they knew to the contrary  even the fortunes of his whole house might take their turn from the humours and dispositions which were then uppermost —Had they duly weighed and considered all this  and proceeded accordingly —I am verily persuaded I should have made a quite different figure in the world  from that  in which the reader is likely to see me —Believe me  good folks  this is not so inconsiderable a thing as many of you may think it —you have all  I dare say  heard of the animal spirits  as how they are transfused from father to son   c   c —and a great deal to that purpose —Well  you may take my word  that nine parts in ten of a man s sense or his nonsense  his successes and miscarriages in this world depend upon their motions and activity   Page  3  and the different tracks and trains you put them into  so that when they are once set a going  whether right or wrong   tis not a half penny matter —away they go cluttering like hey go mad  and by treading the same steps over and over again  they presently make a road of it  as plain and as smooth as a garden walk  which  when they are once used to  the Devil himself sometimes shall not be able to drive them off it   Pray  my dear  quoth my mother  have you not forgot to wind up the clock —Good G    cried my father  making an exclamation  but taking care to moderate his voice at the same time —Did ever woman  since the creation of the world  interrupt a man with such a silly question  Pray  what was your father saying —Nothing   Page  4  CHAP  II   —Then  positively  there is nothing in the question  that I can see  either good or bad —Then let me tell you  Sir  it was a very unseasonable question at least —because it scattered and dispersed the animal spirits  whose business it was to have escorted and gone hand in hand with theHOMUNCULUS  and conducted him safe to the place destined for his reception   The HOMUNCULUS  Sir  in how ever low and ludicrous a light he may appear  in this age of levity  to the eye of folly or prejudice —to the eye of reason in scientifick research  he stands confess d—a BEING guarded and circumscribed with rights —The minutest philosophers   Page  5  who  by the bye  have the most enlarged understandings   their souls being inversely as their enquiries  shew us incontestably  That the HOMUNCULUS is created by the same hand —engender d in the same course of nature —endowed with the same loco motive powers and faculties with us —That he consists  as we do  of skin  hair  fat  flesh  veins  arteries  ligaments  nerves  cartileges  bones  marrow  brains  glands  genitals  humours  and articulations —is a Being of as much activity —and  in all senses of the word  as much and as truly our fellow creature as my Lord
