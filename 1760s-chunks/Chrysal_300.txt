 to say what is proper for you to do  All my   desire is  that you will dismiss me directly  in a capacity of making   good my promises to my friends  and  by the time you say you shall   be ready to move with your army  I hope to give a good account   of the enemy          That  sir  I have no thought of  However  as you are so desirous   of going  I shall not delay you  I ll form a plan of operations for   you this very day          For me  sir   I do not understand you  How can you know   what will be proper or possible for me to do  at the distance of   many hundred miles  in a country you are an utter stranger to    In Europe  where war  like a game of chess  is played  as I may   say  entirely by art  that method of planning in the closet the opera    tions of the field may do  perhaps   but then it is necessary that   each side should play the game by the same rules  A body of   Americans  who know nothing of the art of war but fighting  might   be apt to move so irregularly as to disconcert the whole scheme   of the game  Indeed  by what I can judge of the matter  that very   method of planning the operations of a campaign is advantageous   only to the general  as it prolongs the war  and consequently the   emoluments of command  by tying up his hand from avaihng   himself of any unforeseen circumstances in his favour  Whereas    if armies were sent out only to fight  an formerly  before the im    provements in the art of war  the dispute would soon be decided    and even the vanquished better off than the victors are at present    whose riches and strength are so exhausted by this dilatory way of   proceeding  that they are not the better for their success  I hope    sir  you do not talre offence at the plainness of my speech  I have   so long been accustomed to converse with savages  who speak just   what they thinli  that I am become quite a stranger to that dis    simulation which is called politeness among civilized nations  and   must make use of words in their original intention of conveying   my thoughts          Not in the least  sir  I like your free manner much   it is in the   character of a soldier  I will order eveiything to be got ready for   you directly  and you shall go as soon as you please  at full liberty   to act as you shall see proper          I hope  sir  I shall not make a bad use of that liberty  And   pray  among the other things  do not forget to order me some   money          Money  sir   What occasion can you possibly have for money   among savages  who do not know the value of it   7         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 353       Why  really  sir  that question is natural  But the matter is    the savages  who come among Europeans  see everything governed   by gold  in such a manner that they have taken it into their heads   we worship it  and therefore are become as eager for it as ourselves    in hopes of gaining an ascendency over us  when they have got our   god in their possession        A conscious heart takes to itself more than was ever meant    The dry maimer in which this was said touched my master to the   quick  and made him not desire to pursue the conversation any   further with such a free speaker  nor have so nice an observer longer   about him  to pry into the motives of his actions  Giving him    therefore  the money he required  he wished him success  with a   forced politeness  and dismissed him to prepare for his departure      It was a pleasure to me to change my service on this occasion    as the idea I had conceived of my new master  both from his appear    ance and conversation  promised me some variety  and my curiosity   was heartily surfeited with the regular art of war          CHAPTER VI     THE MANNER IN WHICH CHBYSAL S MASTEB WAS RECEIVED BY HIS   SUBJECTS â€” ANTIQUATED PRINCIPLES ON WHICH HIS AUTHORITY   WAS EOUNDED â€” HIS ODD OPINIONS AND CONDUCT IN SOME IM    PORTANT MATTERS  WITH THE CONSEQUENCES
