same Harmony   I would not have the sympathetick Power extend to Pain  or Discord     I heartily wish you the Compliments of the Season  and a long and uninterrupted Succession   225 of healthful and happy Years  I am now  and ever shall be  your truly affectionate Friend and Servant   Frances   LETTER CXX   Dear FANNY   I AM just got Home  for I was so ill on the Road  that I was not able to perform the Journey in the usual Time  What alarms me is  that I neither find myself better  or worse  which makes me apprehend  that the Disorder is become Part of my Constitution  for  to borrow an Allusion from moral Things  it has been observed that Persons of equal Tempers have been always found in Love  or Friendship  more remarkable for Constancy  than those who are subject to Heats and Colds   Memorandum —This Cold I got in the Court of Chancery  and I fear it will last  like a Chancery Suit  for Life  tho   to shew you I am not splenetick about the Matter  let us talk of Death and Burial a little  for those  who are most afraid  care least to speak of them  As to my Death  I would chuse a sudden one  contrary to a Prayer in the Litany  for I hope nothing from a Death bed Repentance  as  by the Tenor of a Man s Life  he ought  in Justice  to be judged  If I was to linger  I should chuse to be in Pain  as the getting Ease might better reconcile me to the Thoughts of Death     226As to my Burial  I do not like any of the Methods used by the Antients  or Moderns  The Egyptian Mummy  which was in the highest Esteem  I dislike more than all  for I can t bear the Thought of lying a Moment idle  either alive  or dead  for which Reason  I prefer Burning the Body to any other Way   not in the Asbesto Shrowd  because the Parts dissipated in Smoke fall immediately to Earth again  and become the first Food of Plants  which immediately become the first Food of Animals  so that a Man may have a Resurrection of every Part of his Body  in a short Time after his Death  which  tho  he will not be conscious of  will surely flatter his Vanity  as well as the Thoughts of Fame  which he is supposed to know as little of  But tho  I prefer Burning  for these Reasons  to any other Method usually practised  yet  if I were to chuse for myself  I would rather be devoured by Beasts  as  by that Means  I should more immediately become Part of a living Animal  and the Beasts I would name  should be Dogs  because their Instinct comes the nearest to human Reason  of any Brute  and the Dogs I would pitch upon  should be three  of three different Kinds  a Mastiff  for its Courage  a Hound  for its Sagacity  and a Spaniel  for its Fidelity   I have just received a Letter from you  which may not improperly be taken Notice of here  as the Thoughts of Death  and Parting from you    227 are equally distant from me  How could you write so peevishly  my little cross Pet —I am extremely concerned to hear you are ill  and beg to know how you are  by the Return of the Post   LETTER CXXI  FRANCES to HENRY   A KIND of Superstition  which I have neither Power nor Inclination to account for  impels me  in Contradiction to my Reason  to write to you  When I wrote last  I resolved to write no more  there is nothing in your Letter  that requires an Answer  yet in a Room full of Company  where I have dined and supped   for it is now near 12 o Clock  I cannot resist a something like Insatuation  that prompts me to tell you  I am really concerned  and alarmed at the Account  you give me of yourself  with Regard to your Mind  as well as Body    Dost thou delight to make a constant Martyr of me   There is something so extremely ill natured in your endeavouring to shock me with the Mention of your Death  as I should not easily forgive  did not my superior Concern for your ill Health  and gloomy Habit of Mind  absorb all other Considerations —That the Thought of Death is  and should be frequent with all rational Mortals  I allow  but  had you even common Tenderness for me  it is the last Subject you would treat on  it is indeed   228 the only melancholy Thought  you have not rendered familiar to me  and it is a Kind of Disgrace to me  that I am not more conversant with what I have so often experienced—for Death is Parting —    This Day twelvemonth we were reconciled  and now  with a Heart and Eyes overflowing with the sincerest Tenderness  I bid Adieu to my dear Harry  and all those vain imaginary Schemes of Happiness  which my fond
