these servants might be to this mistress of their Lord  We read but of one grateful Cromwell  in all the superb train of Wolsey  when he had fallen into disgrace  and yet he had in it hundreds  some not ignobly born  and all of them less meanly descended than their magnificent master   Halden addressed himself to me  as having been the means of making his Lord  and his whole houshold  happy  Let the joy be moderate  Halden  said I  The poor woman might  possibly  have numbered among her well wishers  she could not have disobliged every  body  some of those  who now will be most forward to load her with obloquy  You must not make her too considerable  It is best for my Lord  as well as for those who loved her not  to forget there ever was such a woman  except to avoid her faults  and to imitate her in what was commendable  She boasts of her honesty and management  My Lord charges her not with infidelity  of any kind   Halden bowed  and withdrew     83 My Lord swore  by his soul  that I had not my good name for nothing  Blessed  said he  be the name of the Grandisons  This last plaudit gratified my pride  I need not tell my Dr  Bartlett  that I have pride   the more gratified it  as Lord W  s animosity to my father made him out of love with his name   I did not think  when my Lord began his story to me  that I should so soon have brought about a separation of guilt from guilt  But their matual disgusts had prepared the way  resentment and pride  mingled with avarice on one side  and self interestedness  founded  reasonably  on a stipulation made  and not complied with  on the other  were all that hindred it from taking place as from themselves  A mediator had nothing then to do  but to advise an act of justice  and so to gild it by a precedent of disinterestedness in himself  as should inspire an emulation in a proud spirit  that  if not then  must  when passion had subsided  have arisen  to make all end as it ought   When I found my Lord s joy a little moderated  I drew my chair near him  Well  my Lord  and now as to your hints of marriage—  Blessed God —Why  nephew  you overturn me with your generosity  Are you not my next of kin  And can you give your consent  were I to ask it  that I should marry   I give you not only my consent  as you condescendingly phrase it  but my advice  to marry   Good God  I could not  in the like case  do thus  But  nephew  I am not a young man   The more need of a prudent  a discreet  a tender assistant  Your Lordship hinted  that you liked not men servants about your person  in your illness  You are often indisposed with the gout  Servants will not always be servants when they find themselves of use  Infirmity requires indulgence  In the very nature of the word and thing  indulgence cannot exist with servility  between man and wife it may  The same interest   84 unites them  Mutual confidence  who can enough value the joy  the tranquillity at least  that results from mutual confidence  A man gives his own consequence to the woman he marries  and he sees himself respected in the respect paid her  She extends his dignity  and confirms it  There is such a tenderness  such an helpfulness  such a sympathy in suffering  in a good woman  that I am always for excusing men in years  who marry prudently  while I censure  for the same reason  women in years  Male nurses are unnatural creatures   There is not such a character that can be respectable  Womens sphere is the house  and their shining place the sick chamber  in which they can exert all their amiable  and  shall I say  lenient qualities  Marry  my Lord  by all means  You are hardly Fifty  but were you Seventy  and so often indisposed  so wealthy  no children to repine at a mother in law  and to render your life or hers uncomfortable by their little jealousies  I would advise you to marry  The man or woman deserves not to be benefited in the disposition of your affairs  that would wish you to continue in the hands of mean people  and to rob you of the joys of confidence  and the comfort of tender help  •rom an equal  or from one who deserves to be made your equal  in degree  Only  my Lord  marry so  as not to defeat your own end  Marry not a gay creature  who will be sluttering about in public  while you are groaning in your chamber  and wishing for her presence   Blessings on your heart  my nephew  Best of men  I can bold no longer  There was no bearing  before  your generosity  What can I say now —But you must be in earnest
