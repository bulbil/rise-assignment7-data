Love  and  if we were Antediluvians  your Choice might be prudent  but he  that is born of the Women now a days  has but a short Time to live  therefore it must certainly be better Oeconomy to make our Joys exceed  in Exquisiteness  what they fall short of in Duration  by which Means we are before hand with old Time  and he has less to cut us off from    18 when he draws his Scythe  But  as they say  Time strengthens Friendship  and weakens Love  you may  with a little Patience  see your strange Scheme come to pass at last  upon this Assurance  that I shall always add to one  what I diminish from the other  and perhaps we may become an hopeful old Couple in Time     We should do in Life  as Gamesters do at Play  push away for what they call  the great Game  but  finding the Run against us  we are then  and not  till then  to play our Cards for the after Game  Now  when we find Love beginning to decline  we may shuffle a good sober Friendship out of it  but Love never was pieced up out of a decayed Friendship  So that indeed  my Dear  you seem to begin at the wrong End  and have both Reason and Nature against you   I am  my dearest Sappho  or tenth Muse   Your s   c   LETTER XIII   HALF angry  Half pleased with my dear Harry s sprightly Epistle —I am quite divided  whether I should make any Reply to it  or not  but I have still so much Regard left for you  as to wish to convince you that your Opinion   19 is quite erroneous  Love  which is not founded on Esteem  can neither be real  or permanent  it is only the Effect of a wanton Caprice  and is more likely to terminate in Disgust than Friendship  Pure Love  like pure Gold  cannot subsist without an Allay  which  tho  it debases the ideal Value  enhances the true one  by making them both  Love and Gold  more fixed  and fit for Use  and I dare answer for it  that the Love which does not begin in Friendship will never end there  But Friendship is independent  requires no Mixture  no Allay  it s Purity  contrary to the Nature of Gold  is it s Strength and Stability  nor is it without it s Elevations and Transports  the mutual Contemplation of Truth  and the Communication of Knowledge  being higher Enjoyments than mortal Sense is capable of  and  as Young says  upon this Subject    True Friendship warms  it raises  it transports   Like Musick  pure the Joy  without Allay   Whose very Rapture is Tranquility   But Love  like Wine  gives a tumultuous Bliss   Heighten d indeed beyond all mortal Pleasures   But mingles Pangs and Madness in the Bowl     As Friendship then is independent of Love  and self sufficient in it s own Nature  why may it not subsist  from it s own Purity  between Persons of different Sexes  tho  with the Advantage of more Delicacy on one Side  and more Respect on   20 the other  which is more likely to make Friendship lasting than that Freedom and Equality  which is generally between male Friends  This Platonick Love  which I am describing  is of the Nature of that Affection  which subsists between Father and Daughter  Brother and Sister  which consists of such a guardian Benevolence on one Side  and such a Gratitude on the other  as makes the most charming Society in the World   Recant  thou Prophane  nor offend me again  by so much as hinting at that Love  which is independent of Friendship  Adieu   Frances   LETTER XIV   My Dear FANNY   YOUR Essay on Love  and Friendship  I acknowledge to be somewhat too abstracted and refined for me    So Angels love— so let them love for me   When I m an Angel  so my Love shall be   In the mean Time  my Dear   let us e en talk a little like Folks of this World     I know the Objections to my natural Scheme are  that it is vulgar and brutal  now  by calling it vulgar  they acknowledge it to be the common Sense of Mankind  and what all Men agree in must be right    Vox Populi  Vox Dei  is the Adage for it       21As to the Grossness of the Passion  I think  as Brutes are indulged but once a Year  and Man  the Year round  we may fairly conclude Providence to have set the Mark of a rational Pleasure  upon  what is called  a brutal Desire   I believe it possible in Nature  tho  not in human Nature  that there may be such a refined Love as you describe  but then it must be reserved for that State  where we shall live without Food  and  wrapt up in Hallelujah s  resign the Pleasures of Sense
