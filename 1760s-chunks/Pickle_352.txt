he ruminated on his next step  which would have been to the  Marshalsea  and saw the night come on  attended with hunger and cold   the wind began to blow  and the tiles of the house rattled with the  storm  His imagination was immediately struck with the idea of escaping  unperceived  amidst the darkness and noise of the tempest  by creeping  out of the window of his apartment  and making his way over the tops  of the adjoining houses  Glowing with this prospect  he examined the  passage  which  to his infinite mortification  he found grated with iron  bars on the outside  but even this difficulty did not divert him from  his purpose  Conscious of his own strength  he believed himself able to  make a hole through the roof  which seemed to be slender and crazy  and   on this supposition  he barricaded the door with the whole furniture of  the room  then setting himself to work with a poker  he in a few minutes  effected a passage for his hand  with which he gradually stripped off  the boards and tiling  so as to open a sallyport for his whole body   through which he fairly set himself free  groping his way towards the  next tenement  Here  however  he met with an unlucky accident  His hat  being blown off his head  chanced to fall into the court just as one  of the bailiff s followers was knocking at the door  and this myrmidon   recognizing it  immediately gave the alarm to his chief  who   running up stairs to the garret  forced open the door in a twinkling   notwithstanding the precautions which the prisoner had taken  and  with  his attendant  pursued the fugitive through his own track   After this  chase had continued some time   said the officer   to the imminent  danger of all three  I found my progress suddenly stopped by a skylight   through which I perceived seven tailors sitting at work upon a board   Without the least hesitation  or previous notice  I plunged among them  with my backside foremost  Before they could recollect themselves from    6 22 15  3 45 PM   the consternation occasioned by such a strange visit  I told them my  situation  and gave them to understand that there was no time to be  lost  One of the number  taking the hint  led me instantly down stairs   and dismissed me at the street door  while the bailiff and his follower   arriving at the breach  were deterred from entering by the brethren of  my deliverer  who  presenting their shears  like a range of chevaux de  frise  commanded them to retire  on pain of immediate death  And the  catchpole  rather than risk his carcase  consented to discharge the  debt  comforting himself with the hope of making me prisoner again   There  however  he was disappointed  I kept snug  and laughed at his  escape warrant  until I was ordered abroad with the regiment  when I  conveyed myself in a hearse to Gravesend  where I embarked for Flanders   but  being obliged to come over again on the recruiting service  I was  nabbed on another score  And all the satisfaction my first captor has  been able to obtain  is a writ of detainer  which  I believe  will fix  me in this place  until the parliament  in its great goodness  shall  think proper to discharge my debts by a new act of insolvency    Everybody owned  that the captain s success was equal to the hardiness  of his enterprise  which was altogether in the style of a soldier  but  one of the merchants observed  that he must have been a bailiff of small  experience  who would trust a prisoner of that consequence in such an  unguarded place   If the captain   said he   had fallen into the hands  of such a cunning rascal as the fellow that arrested me  he would not  have found it such an easy matter to escape  for the manner in which I  was caught is perhaps the most extraordinary that ever was practised  in these realms  You must know  gentlemen  I suffered such losses by  insuring vessels during the war  that I was obliged to stop payment   though my expectations were such as encouraged me to manage one  branch of business  without coming to an immediate composition with my  creditors  and  in short  I received consignments from abroad as usual   that I might not be subject to the visits of those catchpoles  I never  stirred abroad  but  turning my first floor into a warehouse  ordered  all my goods to be hoisted up by a crane fixed to the upper story of my  house  Divers were the stratagems practised by those ingenious ferrets   with a view of decoying me from the walls of my fortification  I  received innumerable messages from people  who wanted to see me at  certain taverns  upon particular business  I was summoned into the  country  to see my
