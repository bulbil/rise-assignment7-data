 and am sorry for the occasion —We will all sit down  Compose yourself  dear Miss Byron—And  holding up his clasped hands to me  I beseech you  forgive me   Well  Sir  I forgive you—I forgive you  Sir   Were you not in so much disorder  Madam—Were it to be seasonable now—I would tell you what I have further to beg  I would—    69 Speak  Sir  now  and never let me—  Suffer an interruption  Madam—I am too apprehensive of that word never  You must allow of my address  I ask you not any favour  but as I shall behave myself in future   Yes  yes  Sir  your behaviour—But  Sir  were you to become the best man in the world  this  this  is the last time that I ever—  Dear Miss Byron  And then he pleaded his passion  his fortune  his sufferings —A wretch   Yet I had now and then a little pity for his disfigured mouth and lip —His resolutions to be governed by me in every act of his life—The settlement of one half of his estate upon me —The odious wretch mentioned children  my dear—younger children  He ran on in such a manner as if he had been drawing up marriage articles all the way hither   Upon my absolutely renouncing him  he asked me  If Sir Charles Grandison had not made an impression on my heart   What  Lucy  could make me inwardly fret at this question  I could hardly have patience to reply  I now see  my dear  that I have indeed a great deal of pride   Surely  Sir Hargrave  I am not accountable to you—  You are not  Madam  But I must insist upon an answer to this question  If Sir Charles Grandison has made an application to you for favour  I can have no hope   Sir Charles Grandison  Sir  is absolutely disinterested  Sir Charles Grandison has made—There I stopt  I could not help it   No application to my cousin  I assure you  Sir Hargrave  said Mr  Reeves  He is the noblest of men  Had he any such thoughts  I dare say  he would be under difficulties to break his mind  lest such a   70 declaration should be thought to lessen the merit of his protection   A good thought of Mr  Reeves  And who knows  my Lucy  but there may be some foundation for it   Protection  D—n it —But I am the easier upon this assurance  Let me tell you  Mr  Reeves  that  had I not sound him to be a wonder of a man  matters should not have ended as they seem at present to have done   But  Sir Hargrave  said Mrs  Reeves  permit me to say  as I know Miss Byron s mind  that there cannot be the least room to imagine that Miss Byron—  Dear Mrs  Reeves  forgive me  But I cannot receive a denial from any other mouth than hers  Is there no room for a sincere penitent to hope for mercy from a sweetness so angelic  and who is absolutely disengaged   You have had mine already  Sir Hargrave  said I  I am amaz d  that  knowing my mind before your wicked insult upon me  you should have any expectation of this kind after it   He again vowed his passion and such stuff   I think  Lucy  I never shall be able  for the future  to hear with patience any man talk of love  of passion  and such nonsense   Let me summarily add  for I am tired of the subject  that he said an hundred impertinent things  sillier than any of those said by Mr  Grandison  in my praise  indeed every thing of this nature now appears silly to me —He insisted upon a preference to Mr  Greville  Mr  Fenwick  Mr  Orme —He resolved not to despair  as his sufferings for my sake had given him  as he said he presumed to hope  some merit in his own opinion  if not in mine  and as his forgiveness of the man who had injured him  ought  he thought  to have some weight in his favour   He took leave of my cousins and me in a very respectful   71 manner  I wish him no harm  But I hope I shall never see him again   And  now  Lucy  with the end of this very disagreeable visit  I will conclude my letter  and shall have another long one ready for the next post   LETTER V  Miss HARRIET BYRON  To Miss LUCY SELBY    March 3   I Had not recovered myself after Sir Hargrave s visit  when Lady L  and Miss Grandison called  as they said for a moment  however this agreeable moment lasted two hours  Miss Grandison  the instant she saw me  challenged me—Hey day  What s the matter with our Harriet  Mrs  Reeves  And  patting my neck  Why these flutters  child —Perturbations delightful  or undelightful  Harriet  whether   I told her who had been here  and but just left me  and
