at a loss himself  for words   At last  I asked you  madam  I asked you  hesitatingly began he  whether you knew any thing of the learned languages  It has been whispered to me  that you have had great advantages from a grandfather  of whose learning and politeness we have heard much  He was a scholar  He was of Christ s  in our University  if I am not mistaken—To my question you answered  That you knew not particularly which were the languages that I called the learned ones  and you have been pleased to throw out hints in relation to the lesser and to the greater University  by all which you certainly mean something—  Pray  Mr  Walden  said I—  And pray  Miss Byron—I am afraid of all smatterers in learning  Those who know a little—and Ladies cannot know to the bottom—They have not the happiness of an University education—  Nor is every man at the University  I presume  Sir  a Mr  Walden     65 He took it for a compliment—Why  as to that  madam—bowing—But this is a misfortune to Ladies  not a fault in them—But  as I was going to say  Those who know little  are very seldom sound  are very seldom orthodox  as we call it  whether respecting religion or learning  And as it seems you lost your Grandfather too early to be well grounded in the latter  in the former Lady Betty  who is my informant  says  you are a very good young Lady  I should be glad to put you right if you happen to be a little out of the way   I thank you  Sir  bowing  and  Simpleton   still playing with my fan  But  tho  Mr  Reeves said nothing  he did not think me very politely treated  Yet he wanted  he told me afterwards  to have me drawn out  He should not have served me so  I told him  especially among strangers  and men   Now  madam  will you be pleased to inform me  said Mr  Walden  Whether you had any particular meaning  when you answered  that you knew not which I called the learned languages  You must know  that the Latin and Greek are of those so called   I beg  Mr  Walden  that I may not be thus singled out—Mr  Reeves—Sir—you have had University education  Pray relieve your cousin   Mr  Reeves smiled  bowed his head  but said nothing   You were pleased  madam  proceeded Mr  Walden  to mention one learned Lady  and said that she looked upon herself as an owl among the birds—  And you  Sir  said  that you had rather  and I believe most men are of your mind  have a woman you could teach—  Than one who would suppose she could teach me  I did so   Well  Sir  and would you have me be guilty of an ostentation that would bring me no credit  if I had had some pains taken with me in my education  But indeed  Sir  I know not any thing of those you call   66 the learned languages  Nor do I take all learning to consist in the knowlege of languages   All learning —Nor I  madam—But if you place not learning in language  be so good as to tell us what do you place it in   He nodded his head with an air  as if he had said  This pretty Miss is got out of her depth  I believe I shall have her now   I would rather  Sir  said I  be an hearer than a speaker  and the one would better become me than the other  I answered Sir Hargrave  because he thought proper to apply to me   And I  madam  apply to you likewise   Then  Sir  I have been taught to think  that a learned man and a linguist may very well be two persons  In other words  That science  or knowlege  and not language merely  is learning   Very well  Be pleased to proceed  madam   Languages  I own  Sir  are of use  to let us into the knowlege for which so many of the antients were famous—But—  Here I stopt  Every one s eyes were upon me  I was a little out of countenance   In what a situation  Lucy  are we women —If we have some little genius  and have taken pains to cultivate it  we must be thought guilty of affectation  whether we appear desirous to conceal it  or submit to have it called forth   But  what  madam  Pray proceed  eagerly said Mr  Walden—But  what  madam   But have not the moderns  Sir  if I must speak  if they have equal genius s  the same heavens  the same earth  the same works of God  or of nature  as it is called  to contemplate upon  and improve by  The first great genius s of all had not human example  had not human precepts—  Nor were the first genius s of all  with an emphasis  replied Mr  Walden
