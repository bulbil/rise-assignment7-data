     CHAPTER VII       Is a medley of various particulars  which pave the way for matters of   more consequence          Miss Flora had now nothing in her head but the many hearts she expected   to captivate when she should arrive in L    e  and Lady Mellasin  who   soothed her in all her vanities  resolved to spare nothing which she   imagined would contribute to that purpose  Miss Betsy  who had the same   ambition  though for different ends  made it also pretty much her study   to set off  to the best advantage  the charms she had received from   nature  The important article of dress now engrossed the whole   conversation of these ladies  The day after that in which Lady Trusty   had made the invitation to the two young ones  Lady Mellasin went with   them to the mercer s to buy some silks  she pitched on a very genteel   new fashioned pattern for her daughter  but chose one for Miss Betsy   which  though rich  seemed to her not well fancied  she testified her   disapprobation  but Lady Mellasin said so much in the praise of it  and   the mercer  either to please her  or because he was desirous of getting   it sold  assured Miss Betsy that it was admired by every body  that it   was the newest thing he had in his shop  and had already sold several   pieces to ladies of the first quality  All this did not argue Miss Betsy   into a liking of it  yet between them she was over persuaded to have it    When these purchases were made  they went home  only stopping at the   mantua maker s in their way  to order her to come that afternoon  Lady   Mellasin did no more than set them down  and then went in the coach to   make a visit       The young ladies fell to reviewing their silks  but Miss Betsy was no   way satisfied with hers  the more she looked upon it  the worse it   appeared to her   I shall never wear it with any pleasure   said she   I   wish the man had it in his shop again  for I think it quite ugly   Miss   Flora told her  that she wondered at her  that the thing was perfectly   handsome  and that my lady s judgment was never before called in   question   That may be   replied Miss Betsy   but certainly every one   ought to please their own fancy in the choice of their cloaths  for my   part  I shall never endure to see myself in it     Not when their fancy   happens to differ from that of those who know better than themselves   what is fit for them   cried Miss Flora   and  besides  have the power   over them   She spoke this with so much pertness  that Miss Betsy  had   had a violent spirit  was highly provoked   Power over them   cried she     I do not know what you mean  Miss Flora  Mr  Goodman is one of my   guardians  indeed  but I don t know why that should entitle his lady to   direct me in what I shall wear        Mr  Goodman  who happened to be looking over some papers in a little   closet he had within his parlour  hearing part of this dispute  and   finding it was like to grow pretty warm  came out  in hopes of   moderating it  On hearing Miss Betsy s complaint  he desired to see the   silk  which being shewn him   I do not pretend   said he   to much   understanding in these things  but  methinks  it is very handsome     It   would do well enough for winter  Sir   replied Miss Betsy   but it is   too hot and heavy for summer  besides  it is so thick and clumsy  it   would make me look as big again as I am  I ll not wear it  I am   resolved  in the country  whatever I do when I come to town  in the dark   weather         Well   said Mr  Goodman   I will speak to my lady to get it changed for   something else     Indeed  Sir   cried Miss Flora   I am sure my mamma   will do no such thing  and take it very ill to hear it proposed     You   need not put yourself in any heat   replied Miss Betsy   I don t desire   she should be troubled any farther about it  but  Sir   continued she    turning to Mr
