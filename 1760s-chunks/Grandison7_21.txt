thee  I will seek thy face  bless thy name  sing thy praises  love thy Law  do thy will  enjoy thy peace  hope thy glory  till my final hour  Thus shall I grasp all that can be grasped by man  This will heighten good  and soften evil in the present life  And when death summons  I shall sleep sweetly in the dust  till his mighty CONQUEROR bids the trumpet sound  and then shall I  through his merits  awake to eternal glory   LETTER XI  Lady GRANDISON  In Continuation   Dec  21   SIR Charles  God be praised  arrived here in safety about two hours ago  He has settled every thing between Lady Beauchamp and the now Sir Edward    53 to the satisfaction of both  for they entirely referred themselves to him  This was the method he took —As their interests were not naturally the same  he enquired of each separately  what were the wishes of each  and finding the Lady s not unreasonable  he referred it to Sir Edward  of his own generosity  to compliment her with more than she asked   Particularly she had wished to Sir Charles  that she might not be obliged to remove under a twelvemonth from the house in Berkley square  And when Sir Charles had brought them together  and pronounced between them  making that an article  Sir Edward  on one knee  thus bespoke her   All that your Ladyship demands I most chearfully comply with  Instead of the year you wish to remain in Berkley square  let me beg of you  still to consider both houses as your own  and me your inmate only  as in the life time of my father  I never will engage in marriage  but with your approbation  Let us  madam  be as little as possible separated  Be pleased only to distinguish  that I wish not this  but from pure and disinterested motives  I will be your servant as well as son  I will take all trouble from you that you shall think trouble  but never will offer so much as my humble advice to you in the conduct of your own affairs  unless you ask for it   She wept  We will henceforth  said she  have but one interest  You shall be dear to me  for your father s sake  Let me  for the same dear sake  be regarded by you  Receive me  excellent pair of friends  proceeded she  as a third in your friendship  Should any misunderstanding arise  which  after so happy a setting out  I hope  cannot be  let Sir Charles Grandison determine between us  Justice and He are one   Sir Charles invited down to us the Lady and his Beauchamp  He hopes they will come  The young Baronet  I dare say  will  Emily says  she wants to   54 see how he will become his new dignity  Very well  I dare say  said I  Why yes  such an example before him  I don t doubt but he will   Lucy was present  Near 4000l  a year  and a title  said she—I think you and I  my dear  were we nearer of an age  would contend for him   Not I  Miss Selby  So that I have the Love of my Guardian and Lady Grandison  you may be Lady Beauchamp for me —You will be of another mind  perhaps  some time hence  said Miss Selby—When I am  replied Emily  tell me of it   Sir Charles  when he was in town  visited his two sisters  He gave me the pleasure of acquainting me  that we shall be favoured with the company of Lord and Lady L  as soon as her Ladyship s visits and visitings are over   Mind  my dear Lady G  what follows   Lady L  said he  is all joy  that her great event is happily over  she and my Lord rewarded with a dear pledge of their mutual Love  But is not Lady G  a little unaccountable  my dear   As how  Sir   She hardly seems to receive pleasure in her happy prospects  She appears to me peevish  even childishly so  to her Lord  I see it the more for her endeavours to check herself before me  She submits but ungraciously to the requisites of the circumstances  that lays him and me  and our several united families under obligation to her  I was unwilling to take notice of her particular behaviour  for two reasons  first  because she wants not understanding  and would see her own error before she went too far  and next  because she tacitly confessed herself to be wrong  by being evidently desirous to hide her fault from me  But is not our Charlotte a little unaccountable  my dear   What  my dear Lady G  should I have answered  I hope you will allow me to be just  I should have been most sincerely glad to have spoken a good word   55 for you  But to attempt to excuse or palliate an evident fault  looks like a claim put in for allowances for one s own    Indeed  Sir
