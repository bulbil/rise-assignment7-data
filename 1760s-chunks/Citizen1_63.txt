 One single look was sufficient to satisfy her curiosity  I held up the glass to her face  and she shut her eyes  no entreaties could prevail upon her to gaze once more  she was even going to snatch from my hands  and break it in a thousand pieces  I found it was time therefore to dismiss her as incorrigible  and shew away to the next that offered   This was an unmarried lady  who continued in a state of virginity till thirty six  and then admitted a lover when she despaired of an husband  No woman was louder at a revel than she  perfectly free hearted  and almost in every respect a man  she understood ridicule to perfection  and was once known even to sally out in order to beat the watch   Here  you my dear with the outlandish face   said she addressing me  let me take a single peep  Not that I care three dams what figure I may cut in the glass of such an old fashioned creature    199 if I am allowed the beauties of the face by people of fashion  I know the world will be complaisant enough to toss me the beauties of the mind into the bargain   I held my glass before her as she desired  and must confess  was shocked with the reflection  The lady  however  gazed for some time with the utmost complacency  and at last turning to me with the most satisfied smile said  she never could think she had been half so handsome   Upon her dismission a lady of distinction was reluctantly hawled along to the glass by her husband  in bringing her forward  as he came first to the glass himself  his mind appeared tinctured with immoderate jealousy  and I was going to reproach him for using her with such severity  but when the lady came to present herself  I immediately retracted  for alas it was seen that he had but too much reason for his suspicions   The next was a lady who usually teized all her acquaintance in desiring to be told of her faults  and then never mended any  Upon approaching the glass  I could readily perceive vanity  affectation  and some other ill looking blots on her mind  wherefore by my advice she immediately set about mending  But I could easily find she was not earnest in the work  for as she repaired them on one side  they generally broke out on another  Thus  after three or four attempts  she began to make the ordinary use of the glass in settling her hair   The company now made room for a woman of learning  who approached with a slow pace and a solemn countenance  which  for her own sake  I   200 could wish had been cleaner   Sir  cried the lady  flourishing her hand  which held a pinch of snuff  I shall be enraptured by having presented to my view a mind with which I have so long studied to be acquainted  but  in order to give the sex a proper example  I must insist  that all the company be permitted to look over my shoulder   I bowed assent  and presenting the glass  shewed the lady a mind by no means so fair as she had expected to see  Ill nature  ill placed pride  and spleen  were too legible to be mistaken  Nothing could be more amusing than the mirth of her female companions who had looked over  They had hated her from the beginning  and now the apartment ecchoed with an universal laugh  Nothing but a fortitude like her s could have withstood their raillery  she stood it however  and when the burst was exhausted  with great tranquility she assured the company  that the whole was a deceptio visus  and that she was too well acquainted with her own mind to believe any false representations from another  Thus saying  she retired with a sullen satisfaction  resolved not to mend her faults  but to write a criticism on the mental reflector   I must own  by this time I began myself to suspect the fidelity of my mirror  for as the ladies appeared at least to have the merit of rising early  since they were up at five  I was amazed to find nothing of this good quality pictured upon their minds in the reflection  I was resolved therefore to communicate my suspicions to a lady  whose intellectual countenance appeared more fair than any of the rest  not having above seventy nine spots in all  besides slips and foibles   I own  young woman  said I  that there are some virtues upon that   201 mind of your s  but there is still one which I do not see represented  I mean that of rising betimes in the morning  I fancy the glass false in that particular   The young lady smiled at my simplicity  and  with a blush  confessed  that she and the whole company had been up all night gaming   By this time all the ladies  except one  had seen themselves successively  and disliked the show  or scolded the show man  I was resolved  however  that she who seemed to neglect herself  and was neglected by the rest  should take a view  and going up to a corner
