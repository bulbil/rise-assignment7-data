was in these words             MONSIEUR        I am sure you ll excuse the trouble I give you  I have  for good   reasons  changed my mind  and I have besought it  as a favour  that Mrs    Andrews will return to me the moment Tom reaches you  I hope  for the   reasons I have given her  she will have the goodness to oblige me  But    if not  you are to order Robin to pursue his directions  and set her   down at her father s door  If she will oblige me in her return  perhaps   she ll give you a letter to her father  for some papers to be delivered   to you for her  which you ll be so good  in that case  to bring to her   here  But if she will not give you such a letter  you ll return with her   to me  if she please to favour me so far  and that with all expedition    that her health and safety will permit  for I am pretty much indisposed    but hope it will be but slight  and soon go off  I am  Yours  etc         On second thoughts  let Tom go forward with Mrs  Andrews s letter  if   she pleases to give one  and you return with her  for her safety           Now this is a dear generous manner of treating me  O how I love to be   generously used   Now  my dear parents  I wish I could consult you for   your opinions  how I should act  Should I go back  or should I   not   I doubt he has got too great hold in my heart  for me to be easy   presently  if I should refuse  And yet this gipsy information makes me   fearful       Well  I will  I think  trust in his generosity  Yet is it not too great   a trust   especially considering how I have been used   But then that   was while he avowed his bad designs  and now he gives great hope of   his good ones  And I may be the means of making many happy  as well as   myself  by placing a generous confidence in him       And then  I think  he might have sent to Colbrand  or to Robin  to carry   me back  whether I would or not  And how different is his behaviour to   that  And would it not look as if I was prepossessed  as he calls it  if   I don t oblige him  and as if it was a silly female piece of pride  to   make him follow me to my father s  and as if I would use him hardly in   my turn  for his having used me ill in his  Upon the whole  I resolved   to obey him  and if he uses me ill afterwards  double will be his   ungenerous guilt   Though hard will be my lot  to have my credulity so   justly blamable  as it will then seem  For  to be sure  the world  the   wise world  that never is wrong itself  judges always by events  And if   he should use me ill  then I shall be blamed for trusting him  If well    O then I did right  to be sure   But how would my censurers act in   my case  before the event justifies or condemns the action  is the   question       Then I have no notion of obliging by halves  but of doing things with   a grace  as one may say  where they are to be done  and so I wrote   the desired letter to you  assuring you  that I had before me happier   prospects than ever I had  and hoped all would end well  And that I   begged you would send me  by the bearer  Mr  Thomas  my master s groom    those papers  which I had sent you by Mr  Williams s conveyance  For   that they imported me much  for clearing up a point in my conduct  that   my master was desirous to know  before he resolved to favour me  as he   had intended   But you will have that letter  before you can have this    for I would not send you this without the preceding  which now is in my   master s hands       And so  having given the letter to Mr  Thomas for him to carry to   you  when he had baited and rested after his great fatigue  I sent for   Monsieur Colbrand  and Robin  and gave to the former his letter
