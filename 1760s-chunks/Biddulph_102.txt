cut off all possibility of a correspondence to England  What then must be your resource  I am prepared against all events  and I would carry you about locked up in an iron cage  like the Turkish tyrant  till I had subdued that termagant spirit  sooner than you should have your liberty to do more mischief  If you have any regard to your own interest  you will endeavour to make me your friend  I have the power and the will to serve you  I have done you no injury  I said I would be your protector  and so I will  if you will suffer me to be so  I said I would be the means of your passing your days in a state more eligible to a woman of either spirit  discretion  or a grain of honour  than you have hitherto done  This I am ready to make good  if you will not be wanting on your part to your own happiness  You have acknowleged that you are conscious of your own errors  are sorry for them  and are willing to quit them  This was turning her own weapons against herself   if you are in earnest in this declaration  I will give you the means of quitting them  The money you have now in your possession     even with the addition of your little jointure  is not sufficient to promise you such a support as would make you easy  if you were to return to England to morrow  and your story known  as it would be   what could you expect  Do you think Arnold could be so besotted as to receive you again  What must be your resource  Why  to continue  while your beauty lasts  in a wretched  abandoned course  Ten thousand to one you might never light on another whose love would be prodigal enough to enrich you  The only choice left you  is to stay where you are not known  and where  if you behave well  you may gain the respect and esteem which you could never hope for in a place where your history is known  If you will content yourself with an easy fortune  joined to a life of virtue and tranquillity  I will provide you with a husband that many a woman in your circumstances would bless her stars for  I will double the portion you have already  and get it settled on you  and will  on certain conditions  add a handsome yearly income  If you do not like this proposal  I have no other alternative to offer but a nunnery  I know you were bred a Roman Catholic  I am sure therefore I shall do no violence to your religious scruples  if you have any  I can get you admitted with ease  the religious here will think it a meritorious act in me  especially on the terms I shall propose  for I will make it worth their while to receive and treat you as a lady of the first family in France  but remember there is a final period to all intercourse with this world  If you think you can bring yourself to submit to such a life  I would really recommend it to you  for I am sollicitous for your happiness both here and hereafter  if not  you have the other choice to make  and so  Madam  a husband or a convent  take which you like best  I give you three days to consider of it   I kept up a severe countenance  and a resolute tone  I rang the bell as soon as I had done speaking  Rachael came in before Mrs Gerrarde could answer me  Take care of your mistress  said I  and left the room  without even the ceremony of a bow  or deigning to look at her  I locked the chamber door  which I took care to clap after me  and  putting the key in my pocket  left the lady and her maid to consult at their leisure   You know  Bidulph  I am not naturally morose  and that I am not very apt to be wanting in that complaisance which all women expect  and which I really think due to almost all women  but this one had  in the preceding scene  so intirely thrown off her sex  that I could hardly consider her as a female  I had known many of her ill qualities    before  but those she now discovered  if they did not shew her more wicked  certainly rendered her more disgustful to me than the others  In short  I found that all decorum was to be laid aside  I had gone too far not to put the finishing hand to my work  and I had no other measures to observe  but to finish  by dint of force  what I had begun by stratagem  When I mentioned the nunnery to you in a former letter  it was in mere gaiety of heart  I had no serious thoughts of that kind  nor did I now propose it as a practicable scheme  I knew the woman too well to suppose she would acquiesce  though  to confess the truth to you honestly  I think  if she refuses my other plan of accommodation  I must compel her to accept of this  nor ought it to be considered
