taken with such  eagerness  and even precipitation  that most of his companions thought  he was either ruined or mad  But he answered all their expostulations  with a string of prudent apophthegms  such as   The shortest follies  are the best    Better to retrench upon conviction than compulsion    and divers other wise maxims  seemingly the result of experience and  philosophic reflection  To such a degree of enthusiasm did his present  economy prevail  that he was actually seized with the desire of  amassing  And as he every day received proposals from those brokers whom  he had employed  about the disposal of his cash  he at length ventured  fifteen hundred pounds upon bottomry  being tempted by the excessive  premium   But it must be observed  for the honour of our adventurer  that this  reformation did not at all interfere with the good qualities of his  heart  He was still as friendly and benevolent as ever  though his  liberality was more subject to the restraint of reason  and he  might have justly pleaded  in vindication of his generosity  that he  retrenched the superfluities in his own way of living  in order to  preserve the power of assisting his fellow creatures in distress   Numberless were the objects to which he extended his charity in private   Indeed  he exerted this virtue in secret  not only on account of  avoiding the charge of ostentation  but also because he was ashamed  of being detected in such an awkward unfashionable practice  by the  censorious observers of this humane generation  In this particular  he  seemed to confound the ideas of virtue and vice  for he did good  as  other people do evil  by stealth  and was so capricious in point of  behaviour  that frequently  in public  he wagged his tongue in satirical  animadversions upon that poverty which his hand had in private  relieved  Yet  far from shunning the acquaintance  or discouraging the  solicitation of those who  he thought  wanted his assistance  he  was always accessible  open  and complaisant to them  even when the  haughtiness of his temper kept his superiors at a distance  and often  saved a modest man the anguish and confusion of declaring himself  by  penetrating into his necessity  and anticipating his request  in a  frank offer of his purse and friendship  Not that he practised this  beneficence to all the needy of his acquaintance without distinction   there is always a set of idle profligate fellows  who  having squandered    6 22 15  3 45 PM   away their own fortunes  and conquered all sense of honour and shame   maintain themselves by borrowing from those who have not yet finished  the same career  and want resolution to resist their importunate  demands  To these he was always inflexible  though he could not  absolutely detach himself from their company  because  by dint of  effrontery  and such of their original connections as they have been  able to retain  they find admission to all places of fashionable resort   Several unsuccessful attacks had been made upon his pocket by beggars of  this class  One of the most artful of them  having one day joined him  in the Mall  and made the usual observation on the weather  d  d all  the fogs of London  and began a dissertation on the difference of air   preferring that of the country in which he was born to any climate under  the sun   Were you ever in Gloucestershire   said he to Peregrine  who  replying in the negative  he thus went on   I have got a house there   where I should be glad to see you  Let us go down together during the  Easter holidays  I can promise you good country fare and wholesome  exercise  for I have everything within myself  and as good a pack of  fox hounds as any in the three kingdoms  I shan t pretend to expatiate  upon the elegance of the house  which to be sure is an old building  and  these  you know  are generally cold  and not very convenient  But  curse  the house  the dirty acres about it are the thing  and d  d fine parcel  they are to be sure  If my old grandmother was dead  she can t live  another season  for she s turned of fourscore  and quite worn out  nay   as for that matter  I believe I have got a letter in my pocket  giving  an account of her being despaired of by the doctors  Let me see  No  d    it  I left it at home  in the pocket of another coat    Pickle  who  from the beginning of this harangue  saw its tendency   seemed to yield the most serious attention to what he said  breaking in  upon it  every now and then  with the interjections  hum  ha  the deuce   and several civil questions  from which the other conceived happy omens  of success  till perceiving they had advanced as far as
