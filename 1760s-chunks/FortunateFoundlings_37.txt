world  except the baron de la Valiere  who was absent  had   the least intimation of his passion  they might probably have lived a   long time together in the contentment they now enjoyed  had not an   accident  of which neither of them could have any notion  put a stop   to it       Horatio thought no more on the affair of madame de Olonne and monsieur   de Coigney  from the time he had been cleared of having any concern with   that lady  yet was that night s adventure productive of what he looked   upon as the greatest misfortune could befal him  But to make this matter   conspicuous to the reader  it is necessary to give a brief detail of the   circumstances that led to it       This lady  who was wife to the baron de Olonne  was one of the most   beautiful  and most vicious women in the kingdom  she entertained a   great number of lovers  but there was none more attached to her  or more   loved by her than young monsieur de Coigney  he had for a long time   maintained a criminal correspondence with her  to the great trouble of   all his friends  who endeavoured all they could  but in vain  to wean   him from her  he had lately a recounter with one of her former lovers    which had like to have cost him his life  and it was with great   difficulty  and as much as the relations on both sides could do  by   representing to the king that they were set upon by street robbers  that   they avoided the punishment the law inflicts on duelists  De Coigney was   but just recovered of the hurts he had received  when  so far from   resolving to quit the occasion of them  he made an appointment to meet   her at the masquerade   they had described to each other the habit they   intended to wear  when  as he was preparing for the rendezvous  an   express came from the king  commanding his immediate attendance at   Marli  where the court then was  this was occasioned by old monsieur de   Coigney  who having  by some spies he kept about his son  received   intelligence of this assignation  had no other way to disappoint it than   by the royal authority  which he easily procured  as he was very much in   favour with his majesty  and had laid the matter before him       The person who came with the mandate had orders not to quit the presence   of young Coigney  but bring him directly  by which means he was deprived   of all opportunity of sending his excuses to madame de Olonne  who   coming to the masquerade big with expectation of seeing her favourite   lover  and finding him  as she imagined  engaged with others  and wholly   regardless of herself  was seized with the most violent jealousy  and   not able to continue in a place where she had received so manifest a   slight  desired mademoiselle de Freville  her confidant and companion    to upbraid him with his inconstancy  which request she complied with in   the manner already related  and which gave mademoiselle Charlotta such   matter of disquiet       The amorous madame de Olonne  however  having given vent to the first   transports of her fury  could not hinder those of a softer nature from   returning with the same violence as ever  and for the gratification of   them wrote that letter which Horatio received  and occasioned afterward   the explanation of the whole affair  which explanation he then thought   fortunate for him  but by a whimsical effect of chance it proved utterly   the reverse       Mademoiselle de Coigney  who had the most tender affection for her   brother  and passionately wished to make him break off all engagements   with a woman of madame de Olonne s character  and who might possibly   bring him under many inconveniencies  took the hint which mademoiselle   Charlotta unthinkingly gave  by telling her how she had been affronted   on his account by de Freville  of putting something into his head which   might probably succeed better than all the attempts had hitherto been   practised to make him quit his present criminal amour       The first time she saw mademoiselle de Freville  she told her as a great   secret that her brother was fallen in love with mademoiselle Charlotta    and that she believed it would be a match  for he had already engaged   friends to sollicit monsieur de Palfoy on that score  This she knew would   be carried directly to madame de Olonne  and doubted not but it would so   increase her jealous rage  that all he could say in his defence would   pass for nothing  she also added  that he was in the masquerade that
