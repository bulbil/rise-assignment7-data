you are settled  all the house will be upon the watch  your most trivial actions will be minutely sifted  You will lead a life of incessant constraint  you must set yourself off with a counterfeit outside  and affect to entertain a double set of the cardinal virtues in your bosom  You will not have a moment to bestow on pleasure  The everlasting censor of your pupil  your days will pass in teaching grammar and administering saintly reprehension  when he shall say or do anything against decorum  After so much labour and confinement  what will be your reward  If the little gentleman is a pickle  they will lay all the blame on your bad management  and you will be kicked out of the family  it may be without your stipend  Do not tell me then of a tutor s employment  it is worse than a cure of souls  But talk as much as you will about a lacquey s occupation  that is a sinecure  and pledges you to nothing  Suppose one s master not to be immaculate  A servant of superior genius will flatter his vices  and not unfrequently turn them to account  A footman lives at his ease in a good family  After having ate and drank his fill  he goes to bed peaceably  without troubling himself who pays the bills   I should never have done  my dear fellow  pursued he  were I to enumerate all the advantages of service  Trust me  Gil Blas  discard for ever your foolish wish of being a tutor  and follow my example  So be it  but  Fabricio  replied I  governors like yours are not to be met with every day  and if resolved to go to service  I should like at least to get a good situation  Oh  you are in the right  said he  and that shall be my concern  I will get you a comfortable place  if it were only to snatch a fine fellow from the jaws of the university   The near approach of poverty with which I was threatened  and Fabricio s apparent good case  having more weight with me than his arguments  I determined to wear a livery  On which we sallied forth from the tavern  and my townsman said  I am going to introduce you to a man  to whom most of the servants resort when they are on the ramble  he has eaves droppers about him to pick up all that passes in families  He knows at once where the servants are going away  and keeps a correct register  not only of vacant places  but of vacant masters  with their good and bad properties  The fellow has been a friar in some convent or other  In short  he it was who got me my place   While we were conversing about so singular an office of intelligence  the son of Nunez the barber took me into a street which had no thoroughfare  We went into a mean house  where we found a man about fifty writing at a table  We wished him good day  with quite as much humility as became us  but  whether it was from natural pride  or that  from a habit of seeing none but lacqueys and coachmen  he had got a trick of receiving his company with an easy freedom  without rising from his seat  he just gave a slight nod  He seemed surprised that a young man in embroidered velvet should want a place  he had rather expected me to have wanted a servant  However  he was not kept long in doubt  since Fabricio said at once  Signor Arias de Londona  give me leave to introduce one of my best friends  He is a youth of good connections  whom adverse circumstances have reduced to the necessity of going to service  Have the goodness to provide for him handsomely  and you may trust to his gratitude  Gentlemen  replied Arias coolly  this is the way with you all  before you are settled  you make the finest promises in the world  but afterwards  Lord help us  your memories are very short  The deuce  replied Fabricio  why you do not complain of me  Have not I done the thing genteelly  You ought to have done it much better  rejoined Arias  your place is better than a clerk in a public office  and you paid me as if I had quartered you upon a poor author  Here I interfered  and told Master Arias  that to convince him I was not a shabby fellow  I would make my acknowledgments beforehand  at the same time taking out two ducats  with an assurance of not stopping there if he got me into a good berth   He seemed to like my mode of dealing  There are  said he  some very good places vacant  I will give you a list of them  and you shall take your choice  With these words  he put on his spectacles  opened a register on the table  turned over a few of the leaves  and began reading to this effect  Captain Torbellino wants a footman  a hasty  hair brained  humoursome chap  scolds incessantly  swears  kicks his servants  and very often cripples them  Go on to the next  cried I  at this
