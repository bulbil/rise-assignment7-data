the Gleaner s Harvest   c  Or  shall I be thought ridiculous for telling you  that I have spent good Part of this Morning in the Amusement of a Roman Emperor  catching Flies  not like Domitian  to kill them  but to retrieve them from their torpid State by the Heat of my Hand  and have the Joy to see them flutter Page  51 about the Room with added Life and Vigour  I think it a wrong Thing  to discourage  in any Sort  the Exercise of Humanity  even the Talking of it  as by this Means  perhaps  some People may be  as it were  intrapped into Virtue  by professing it first out of Vanity  they may come afterwards to practise it out of Shame  Many a Coward has been induced to fight  because he has happened to boast that he would   In the twenty second Epistle there is a very just Sentiment  and a very proper one to be considered by the severe Moralist  or the outrageously Virtuous    He  who hates Faults  hates Mankind     The twenty third Epistle is a very affecting one  and the Character of Junius Avitus is very amiable  It is  indeed  the Nature of the Afflicted to enumerate every little Circumstance  which once gave us Pleasure in the Enjoyment of what we have lost  and it is sometimes a mortifying Reflection  that  while we are multiplying our Joys  we may  perhaps  be but increasing the Earnest of our Griefs   In the seventh Letter of the ninth Book  and several precedent ones  I find the Reason for Lord Orrery s Essay upon antient Architecture  which  you may remember  I was a little alarmed about in his Preface to this Work  for which I here offer my Palinode   Page  52On the eighth Epistle there is an Instance of Wit in the Comment    Vanity  like Smoke  smothers and obscures the Flame  from whence it proceeds   I have observed a great deal of lively Fancy  as well as just Thought  in my Lord s Writing  through the Course of this Work  And  upon the Whole  I think he has shewn himself a Man of Virtue  a Man of Learning  and a Man of Taste  and if he was not also a Man of Rank and Fortune  which might make my Attachment suspected by Persons  who have none of the Qualities abovementioned to ennoble their Sentiments  I would certainly take some solicitous Pains to become acquainted with him     In the last Paragraph of the Preface to the tenth Book  my Lord seems in Doubt about the rendering the Word  Dominus  which he has done very justly  by translating it  Sir  as it is addressed by Pliny to Trajan  It is in this Manner we speak to our Kings  and the French  who are Patterns of all Politeness and Decorum  salute their Grand Monarque by the Stile of Sire   The twenty eighth Epistle of the tenth Book should immediately precede the thirtieth  because  in this last  he refers to the former  in these Words    I had informed you  by my last Letter  that Lycormas   c   I take especial Notice of the Want of Order in this Particular  Page  53 because my Lord has attempted to place all the Letters of this tenth and last Book in a regular Series  and  upon this Occasion  I shall repeat what I said in a former Letter  Why did he not take the same Pains throughout     In his thirtieth Epistle Pliny gives an absurd Reason for not detaining the Ambassador  He says  it was because Lycormas had desired he should be detained   till he himself arrived   The thirty fifth and thirty ninth Epistles from Trajan are exact Models of all the Court Answers to Public Addresses   Adieu  my Life  and believe me   till Tomorrow s Post   Your s  Athenodorus   LETTER CXCVII   MY dear little Shrub  my Arbutus  my Ever green  I wish you Joy of your Retirement  and happy Vacation from         I am really charmed with your Reasoning upon the Analogy between the finite Perfections and the divine Attributes  so justly deduced from Page  54 the Wisdom and Goodness of Providence  and am pleased  that I carried my Sentiments no farther upon that Subject  than merely to suggest  that  perhaps  there might be no Relation between them  For  when I come close to the Argument with the Divines  I enter the Lists upon their own Terms  but I only fix the Feet of Jacob s Ladder on the Earth  while you soar upon it to the Skies   I meant to consider Mercy  as a self sufficient  distinct  operating Excellence in the Godhead  the proper Objects of which were those  which did not come within the Merits of that Repentance  which might intitle them to the Justice defined in that Letter  I am  my dearest Fanny  well aware  how little orthodox I am in this Opinion  and therefore call upon myself for some Explanation of this Subject  as I seem to make no Difference between the
