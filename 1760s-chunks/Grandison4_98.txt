good natured Lord G —O that you would take half the pains to oblige him  that I do to relieve Mr  Orme —Half the pains  did I say  That you would not take pains to dis oblige him  and he would be  of course  obliged  Don t be afraid  my dear  that in such a world as this  things will not happen to make you uneasy  without your studying for them  Excuse my seriousness  I am indeed too serious at times   But when Mr  Orme requested a few minutes audience of me  as he called it  and I walked with him into the cedar parlour  which you have heard me mention  and with which I hope you will be one day acquainted  he paid  poor man  for his too transient   244 pleasure  Why would he urge a denial that he could not but know I must give   His sister and I had afterwards a conference  She pleaded too strongly her brother s health  and even his life  both which  she would have it  depended on my favour to him  I was greatly affected  and at last besought her  if she valued my friendship as I did hers  never more to mention to me a subject which gave me a pain too sensible for my peace   She requested me to assure her  that neither Mr  Greville  nor Mr  Fenwick  might be the man  They both took upon them  she said  to ridicule her brother for the profound respect  even to reverence  that he bore me  which  if he knew  might be attended with consequences  For that her brother  mild and gentle as was his passion for me  had courage to resent any indignities that might be cast upon him by spirits boisterous as were those of the two gentlemen she had named  She never  therefore  told her brother of their scoffs  But it would go to her heart  if either of them should succeed  or have reason but for a distant hope   I made her heart easy on that score   I have just now heard that Sir Hargrave Pollexfen is come from abroad already  What can be the meaning of it  He is so low minded  so malicious a man  and I have suffered so much from him—What can be the meaning of his sudden return  I am told  that he is actually in London  Pray  my dear Lady G  inform yourself about him  and whether he thinks of coming into these parts   Mr  Greville  when he met us at Stony Stratford  threw out menaces against Sir Hargrave  on my account  and said  It was well he was gone abroad  I told him then  that he had no business  even were Sir Hargrave present  to engage himself in my quarrels     245 Mr  Greville is an impetuous man  a man of rough manners  and makes many people afraid of him  He has  I believe  indeed  had his spies about me  for he seems to know every thing that has befallen me in my absence from Selby house   He has dared also to threaten Somebody else  Insolent wretch  But he hinted to me yesterday  that he was exceedingly pleased with the news  that a certain gentleman was gone abroad  in order to prosecute a former amour  was the light wretch s as light expression  If my indignant eyes could have killed him  he would have fallen dead at my feet   Let the constant and true respects of all my friends to you and yours  and to my beloved Emily  be always  for the future  considered as very affectionately expressed  whether the variety of other subjects leaves room for a particular expression of them  or not  by  my dearest Lady G   Your faithful and ever obliged HARRIET BYRON   LETTER XXXVI  Lady G  To Miss BYRON    Saturday  May 6   I Thank you  Harriet  for yours  What must your fellows think of you  In this gross age  your delicacy must astonish them  There used to be more of it formerly  But how should men know any thing of it  when women have forgot it  Lord be thanked  we females  since we have been admitted into so constant a share of the public diversions  want not courage  We can give the men stare for stare whereever we meet them  The next age  nay  the rising generation  must surely be all heroes and heroines  But whither has this word delicacy carried me  Me  who  it seems  have faults to be corrected for of another   246 sort  and who want not the courage for which I congratulate others   But to other subjects▪ I could write a vast deal of stuff about my Lord and Self  and Lord and Lady L  who assume parts which I know not how to allow them  And sometimes they threaten me with my brother s resentments  sometimes with my Harriet s  so that I must really have leading strings fastened to my shoulders  O my dear  a fond husband is a surfeiting thing  and yet I believe most women love
