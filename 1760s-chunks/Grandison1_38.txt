his share of the public entertainments  Well  so let him  But I hope that I am not to be either his business or entertainment  After a civil neighbourly visit  or so  I hope  I shall not be tormented with him   What happened once betwixt Mr  Fenwick and him  gave me pain enough  exposed me enough  surely  A young woman  tho  without her own fault  made the occasion of a rencounter between two men of fortune  must be talked of too much for her own liking  or she must be a strange creature  What numbers of people has the unhappy rashness of those two men brought to stare at me  And with what difficulty did my uncle and Mr  Deane bring them into so odd a compromise  as they at last came into  to torment me by joint consent  notwithstanding all I could say to them  which was the only probable way  shocking creatures  to prevent murder —And may I not be apprehensive of what may happen  should Sir Hargrave   90 persist in his present way of thinking —Mr  Greville is a rash creature  and Sir John Allestree says  Sir Hargrave wants no resolution   I suppose Mr  Fenwick will come up  if the other does  But pray  my Lucy  let them know—Yet should you tell them that I am greatly averse to seeing them  and that I will not see them if I can help it  that will be giving them consequence in their own opinion  and as the one pleads business  it will be  in the interpretation of so bold a man as Mr  Greville  making myself a part of it  and denying his visit before it is offered  They must  in short  do as they will  if they are resoved to haunt me at the public places to which I am to go  I am not so fond of shew and glitter  but I can forbear going often to them   But to have done with these men—What an odd thing is it in my uncle  to take hold of what I said in one of my Letters  that I had a good mind to give you a sketch of what I might suppose the company at Lady Betty s would say of your Harriet  were each to write her character  to their confidents or correspondents  as she has done theirs to you   I am apprehensive that his command on this occasion is owing to his hope to find room from what I write  to charge me the heavier  But be this as it may  I will endeavour to obey him  and the more readily  as the task will be an exercise to my fancy —Which of you  my dear friends  was it  that once called me a fanciful girl   To begin—Lady Betty  who owns she thinks favourably of me  I will suppose would write to her Lucy  in such terms as these  But shall I suppose every one to be so happy  as to have her Lucy      Miss Byron  of whom you have heard Mr  Reeves talk so much  discredits not  in the main  the character he has given her  We must allow a little  you know  for the fondness of relationship       91  The girl has had a good education  and owes all her advantages to it  But it is a country and bookish one  And that won t do every thing for one of our Sex  if any thing  Poor thing  She never was in town before —But she seems docile  and  for a country girl  is tolerably geneteel  I think  therefore  I shall receive no discredit by introducing her into the Beau Monde    Miss Clements  perhaps  agreeable to the goodness of her kind heart  would have written thus      Miss Byron is an agreeable girl  She has invited me to visit her  and I hope I shall like her better and better  She has  one may see  kept worthy persons company  and I dare say  will preserve the improvement she has gained by it  She is lively and obliging  She is young  not more than twenty  yet looks rather younger  by reason of a country bloom  which  however  misbecomes her not  and gives a modesty to her first appearance  that possesses one in her favour  She is a great observer  yet I think not censorious  What a castaway would Miss Byron be  if knowing so well  as she seems to know  what the duty of others is  she should forget her own      Miss Cantillon would perhaps thus write      There was Miss Harriet Byron of Northamptonshire  a young woman in whose favour report has been very lavish  I can t say that I think her so very extraordinary  Yet she is well enough for a country girl  But tho  I do not impute to her a very pert look  yet if she had not been set up for something beyond what she is  by all her friends  who  it seems  are excessively fond of her  she might have had a more humble opinion of
