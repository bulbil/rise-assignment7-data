thistle and three pedlars  and there he lodged —We thanked him for his information  and went forwards  Strap telling me  that he knew this person to be an honest friendly man by his countenance  before he opened his mouth  in which opinion I acquiesced  ascribing his good manners to the company he daily saw in the house where he served —We followed his directions punctually  in turning to the left and to the right  and to the left again  but instead of seeing a lane before us  we found ourselves at the side of the river  which perplexed us not a little  and my fellow traveller ventured to pronounce  that we had certainly missed our way —By this time we were pretty much fatigued with our walk  and not knowing how to proceed  I went into a smll snuff shop hard by  encouraged by the sign of the highlander  where I found  to my inexpressible satisfaction  the shop keeper my countryman —He was no sooner informed of our peregrination  and the directions we had received   101 from the footman  than he informed us we had been imposed upon  telling us  that Mr  Cringer lived in the other end of the town  and that it would be to no purpose for us to go thither to day  for by that time he was gone to the House —I then asked him if he could recommend us to a lodging  which he readily did  by giving us a line to one of his acquaintance who kept a chandler s shop not far from St  Martin s Lane  here we hired a bed room  up two pair of stairs  at the rate of 2s  per week  so very small  that when the bed was let down  we were obliged to carry out every other piece of furniture that belonged to the apartment  and use the bedstead by way of chairs —About dinner time  our landlord asked us how we proposed to live  to which we answered  that we would be directed by him —   Well then  says he  there are two ways of eating in this town  for people of your condition  the one more creditable and expensive than the other  the first  is to dine at an eating house frequented by well dressed people only  and the other is called diving  practised by those who are either obliged or inclined to live frugally  —  I gave him to understand that provided the last was not infamous  it would suit much better with our circumstances than the other —   Infamous  cried he  God forbid  there are many creditable people  and rich people  ay and fine people  that dive every day —I have seen many a pretty gentleman bedaubed all over with lace  dine in that manner  very comfortably for three pence half penny  and go afterwards to the coffee house  where he made a figure with the best lord in the land —but   102 your own eyes shall bear witness —I will go along with you to day and introduce you  —  He accordingly carried us to a certain lane  where stopping  he bid us observe him  and do as he did  and walking a few paces  dived into a cellar and disappeared in an instant —I followed his example  and descended very successfully  where I found myself in the middle of a cook s shop  almost suffocated with the steams of boil d beef  and surrounded by a company consisting chiefly of hackney coachmen  chairmen  draymen  and a few footmen out of place or on board wages  who sat eating shin of beef  tripe  cow heel or sausages  at separate boards  covered with cloths  which turned my stomach —While I stood in amaze  undetermined whether to sit down or walk upwards again  Strap  in his descent missing one of the steps  tumbled headlong into this infernal ordinary  and overturned the cook as she was carrying a porringer of soup to one of the guests  In her fall  she dashed the whole mess against the legs of a drummer belonging to the foot guards  who happened to be in her way  and scalded him so miserably  that he started up  and danced up and down  uttering a volley of execrations that made my hair stand on end  While he entertained the company in this manner  with an eloquence peculiar to himself  the cook got up  and after a hearty curse on the poor author of this mischance  who lay under the table scratching his rump with a woful countenance  emptied a saltseller in her hand  and stripping down the patient s stocking which brought the skin along with it  applied the contents to the sore —This poultice was scarce laid on  when the drummer  who had   103 begun to abate of his exclamation  broke forth into such a hideous yell  as made the whole company tremble  then seizing a pewter pint pot that stood by him  squeezed the sides of it together  as if it had been made of pliant leather  grinding his teeth at the same time with a most horrible grin  Guessing the cause of this violent transport  I bid the woman wash off the salt  and bathe the part with oil  which she did  and procured him immediate
