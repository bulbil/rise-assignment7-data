the strongest   partiality to the enemies of the King of Bulgaria       Of this that heroic prince overlooked many instances  in com    passion to their folly   but  instead of inspiring them with proper   sentiments of gratitude  this moderation only raised their injudicious   pride so high  that  attributing it to fear  they at length proceeded   so far as to refuse him those good offices  which  by the universal   laws of mankind  he had a right to demand  and treated his mes    sengers with disrespect      This drew on them a resentment that was never raised in vain    The king  without deigning to waste time in complaints  sent a   body of forces directly to their gates  and obliged them to buy their   safety with contributions  and deprecate his vengeance with sub    missions  which humbled their pride  and terrified their neighbours   from being guilty of the like folly      As these contributions were too large to be immediately discharged   by the state  they were obliged to be levied on the subjects  by   which means I came into the service of this monarch  to whose   treasurer I was paid  by the humbled magistrates of the city  on   their knees  The many great things which I had heard of this   prince had long made me wish for such an opportunity of seeing   him  and of having a knowledge of his heart  that I might be able   to judge whether he really was the great man he appeared to the   world  by all his actions  to be  How my expectations were an    swered  cannot be explained justly without a particular account   of everything I saw while I was with him  but  as that would be too   much for my time  which begins to grow short  I shall only give   you a few of the most remarkable particulars  by which you may   form a judgment of the rest  The king was walking in his camp   before the entrance of his tent  after having finished the business    of the morning  conversing with the most engaging affability with   his officers  and even the private sentinels of his guard  redressing   their complaints  and relieving their wants  when the magistrates   of the city I had just left arrived to pay their contributions  and   make submihsion for their misbehaviour   for  to humble them the   more effectually  he had ordered that they should attend himself    As soon as they approached him  they fell on their knees  and     1 King of Prussia          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 229     delivering the money to his treasurer  implored his pardon in the   abject terms of submission        Arise    said the monarch    and cease your supplications   the   posture and address are both improper to be offered to a man     but the passions of ths foolish are ever in extremes  and your fear   sinks you now as low as your vain insolence raised you high before    Depart in peace and safety  and let this teach you not to mistake   moderation for fear another time  But  beware that you offend   not so again  Mercy  that is amiable in the first instance  degener    ates to folly  if extended to a second       The magistrates  unable to speak before him  retired in confusion   from his presence  when  turning to his treasurer â€”   Take    said he      so much of that money as will repair the losses sustained by the   innocent inhabitants of the country around their city  and see that   it is given to sufferers  to be applied to that use  and none other    for I war not with the poor  nor would I have my steps marked by   desolation  when it can possibly be avoided  And of the remainder    leave the usual sum upon my table for my private occasions        Then addressing himself to the ofBcers around him in general â€”     How abject    said he    is the submission of the proud   How   does guilt humble the conscious heart   These unhappy men  who   dared not now meet our eyes  but hasted with downcast looks from the   flash of just indignation  when last we saw them  looked us in the   face with the assurance of friendly respect  and seemed happy in   the marks of our regard  Let this teach us to preserve the ada    mantine shield of a clear conscience  and terror can never strike a   dart through it to our hearts
