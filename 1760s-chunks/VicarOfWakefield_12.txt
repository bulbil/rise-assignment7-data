 Thornhill observed with an oath  that he never knew any thing more absurd than calling such a fright a beauty    For strike me ugly    continued he    if I should not find as much pleasure in choosing my mistress by the information of a lamp under the clock at St  Dunstan s    At this he laughed  and so did we —the jests of the rich are ever successful  Olivia too could not avoid whispering  loud enough to be heard  that he had an infinite fund of humour     After dinner  I began with my usual toast  the Church  for this I was thanked by the chaplain  as he said the church was the only mistress of his affections —   Come tell us honestly  Frank    said the  Page  59   Squire  with his usual archness    suppose the church  your present mistress  drest in lawn sleeves  on one hand  and Miss Sophia  with no lawn about her  on the other  which would you be for     For both  to be sure    cried the chaplain —   Right Frank    cried the  Squire    for may this glass suffocate me but a fine girl is worth all the priestcraft in the nation  For what are tythes and tricks but an imposition  all a confounded imposture  and I can prove it    —   I wish you would    cried my son Moses  and   I think    continued he    that I should be able to combat in the opposition    —   Very well  Sir    cried the  Squire  who immediately smoaked him  and winking on the rest of the company  to prepare us for the sport    if you are for a cool argument upon that subject  I am ready to accept the challenge  And first  whether are you for managing it analogically  or dialogically     I am for managing it rationally    cried Moses  quite happy at being permited to dispute    Good  Page  60  again    cried the  Squire    and firstly  of the first  I hope you ll not deny that whatever is is  If you don t grant me that  I can go no further    —  Why    returned Moses    I think I may grant that  and make the best of it    —   I hope too    returned the other    you ll grant that a part is less than the whole     I grant that too    cried Moses    it is but just and reasonable    —   I hope    cried the  Squire  you will not deny    that the two angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones    —   Nothing can be plainer    returned t other  and looked round with his usual importance —   Very well    cried the  Squire  speaking very quick    the premises being thus settled  I proceed to observe  that the concatanation of self existences  proceeding in a reciprocal duplicate ratio  naturally produce a problematical dialogism  which in some measure proves that the essence of spirituality may be referred to the second predicable   —   Hold  hold    cried the other    I deny that  Do you think I can  Page  61  thus tamely submit to such heterodox doctrines    —   What    replied the  Squire  as if in a passion    not submit  Answer me one plain question  Do you think Aristotle right when he says  that relatives are related     Undoubtedly    replied the other —   If so then    cried the  Squire    answer me directly to what I propose  Whether do you judge the analytical investigation of the first part of my enthymem deficient secundum quoad  or quoad minus  and give me your reasons too  give me your reasons  I say  directly    —   I protest    cried Moses    I don t rightly comprehend the force of your reasoning  but if it be reduced to one simple proposition  I fancy it may then have an answer    —   O  sir    cried the  Squire    I am your most humble servant  I find you want me to furnish you with argument and intellects both  No  sir  there I protest you are too hard for me    This effectually raised the laugh against poor Moses  who sate the only dismal  Page  62  figure in a groupe of merry faces  nor did he offer a single syllable more during the whole entertainment     But though all this gave me no pleasure  it had a very different effect upon Olivia  who mistook this humour  which was a mere act of the memory  for
