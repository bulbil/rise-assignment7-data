    When he entered  his countenance expressed all the passions that his   situation had roused in his mind  He first looked sternly round him  to   see whether ALMORAN was not present  and then fetching a deep sigh he   turned his eyes  with a look of mournful tenderness  upon ALMEIDA  His   first view was to discover  whether ALMORAN had already supplanted him    and for this purpose he collected the whole strength of his mind  he   considered that he appeared now  not as HAMET  but as ALMORAN  and that   he was to question ALMEIDA concerning ALMORAN  while she had mistaken   him for HAMET  he was therefore to maintain the character  at whatever   expence  till his doubts were resolved  and his fears either removed or   confirmed  he was so firmly persuaded  that ALMORAN had been there   before him  that he did not ask the question  but supposed the fact  he   restrained alike both his tenderness and his fears  and looking   earnestly upon ALMEIDA  who had risen up in his presence with blushes   and confusion   To me   says he   is ALMEIDA still cold  and has she   lavished all her love upon HAMET        At the name of HAMET  the blushes and confusion of ALMEIDA increased    her mind was still full of the images  which had risen from the thought   of what HAMET might suffer  if ALMORAN should know that he had been with   her  and though she feared that their interview was discovered  yet she   hoped it might be only suspected  and in that case the removal or   confirmation of the suspicions  on which the fate of HAMET depended    would devolve upon her       In this situation  she  who a few moments before doubted  whether she   should not voluntarily give him up  when nothing more was necessary for   his safety than to be silent  now determined  with whatever reluctance    to secure him  though it could not he done without dissimulation  and   though it was probable that in this dissimulation she would be detected    Instead  therefore  of answering the question  she repeated it   On whom   said my lord  on HAMET   HAMET  whose suspicions were increased by the   evasion  replied with great emotion   Aye  on HAMET  did he not this   moment leave you    Leave me this moment   said ALMEIDA  with yet   greater confusion  and deeper blushes  HAMET  in the impatience of his   jealousy  concluded  that the passions which he saw expressed in her   countenance  and which arose from the struggle between her regard to   truth and her tenderness for HAMET  proceeded from the consciousness of   what he had most reason to dread  and she to conceal  a breach of   virtue  to which she had been betrayed by his own appearance united with   the vices of his brother  he  therefore  drew back from her with a look   of inexpressible anguish  and stood some time silent  She observed  that   in his countenance there was more expression of trouble  than rage  she    therefore  hoped to divert him from persuing his enquiries  by at once   removing his jealousy  which she supposed would be at an end  as soon as   she should disclose the resolution she had taken in his favour    Addressing him  therefore  as ALMORAN  with a voice which though it was   gentle and soothing  was yet mournful and tremulous   Do not turn from   me   said she  with those unfriendly and frowning looks  give me now   that love which so lately you offered  and with all the future I will   atone the past        Upon HAMET  whose heart involuntarily answered to the voice of ALMEIDA    these words had irresistible and instantaneous force  but recollecting    in a moment  whose form he bore  and to whom they were addressed  they   struck him with new astonishment  and increased the torments of his   mind  Supposing what he at first feared had happened  and that ALMORAN   had seduced her as HAMET  he could not account for her now addressing   him  as ALMORAN  with words of favour and compliance  he  therefore    renewed his enquiries concerning himself  with apprehensions of a   different kind  She  who was still solicitous to put an end to the   enquiry  as well for the sake of HAMET  as to prevent her own   embarrassment  replied with a sigh   Let not thy peace be interrupted by   one thought of HAMET  for of HAMET ALMEIDA shall think no more   HAMET    who  though he had fortified himself against whatever might have   happened to
