either menaced  or cajoled  out of even the   smallest part of your rights  it is possible that a man of Mr  Munden s   disposition might hereafter be tempted to encroach upon the whole  and   leave you nothing you could call your own        It is very difficult  if not wholly impossible   continued she   to   judge with any certainty  how to proceed with a person whose temper one   does not know  I am altogether a stranger to that of Mr  Munden  nor can   you as yet pretend to be perfectly acquainted with it  all I can say    therefore  is  that I would have you maintain your own privileges    without appearing to tenacious of them         I have then no other part to take   said Mrs  Munden   than just to lay   out  in the best manner I can  what money he is pleased to allow    without making any addition  what accidents soever may happen to demand   it         I mean so   replied Lady Trusty   and whenever there is any deficiency    as some there must necessarily be  in what might be expected from your   way of living  I would not have you seem to take the least notice of it    behave  as if entirely unconcerned  contented  and easy  leave it to him   to complain  and when he does so  you will have an opportunity  by   shewing the bills of what you have laid out  of proving  that it is not   owing to your want of good management  but to the scarcity of the means   put into your hands  that his table is so ill supplied  but still let   every thing you urge on this occasion be accompanied with all the   softness it is in your power to assume        To this Mrs  Munden  with a deep sigh  made answer  that though she was   an ill dissembler  and besides had little room  from her husband s late   carriage towards her  to flatter herself with any good effect of her   submission  yet she would endeavour to follow her ladyship s counsel  in   making the experiment  however irksome it might be to her to do so       They had a very long conversation together on this head  during the   whole course of which Lady Trusty laboured all she could to persuade the   other to look on her situation in a much less disagreeable light then    in reality  it deserved       But how little is it in the power of argument  to reason away pain  one   is much more deeply affected with what one feels than what one hears    the heart of Mrs  Munden was beset with thorns  which all the words in   the world would have been ineffectual to remove  disappointed in every   thing that could have rendered this marriage supportable to her  her   good nature abused  her spirit humbled and depressed  no considerations   were of force to moderate her passions  but that melancholy one that  as   her misfortunes were without a remedy  the best  and indeed the only   relief that fate permitted  was in patiently submitting       She acted  nevertheless  in every respect  for several days    conformable to the method Lady Trusty had prescribed  and restrained her   temper so as neither by word or action to give Mr  Munden any just cause   of offence  he also kept himself within bounds  though it was easy for   her to perceive  by his sullen deportment  every time he was at table    how ill he was satisfied with the provisions set before him       A cold civility on the one side  and an enforced complaisance on the   other  hindered the mutual discontent that reigned in both their hearts   from being perceptible to any who came to visit them  and also from   breaking into any indecencies between themselves  till one day a   gentleman of fine consideration in the world happening  unexpectedly  to   come to dine with them  Mr  Munden was extremely shocked at being no   better prepared for his entertainment        What  my dear   said he to his wife   have you nothing else to give   us   To which she replied  with a great presence of mind   I am quite   ashamed and sorry for the accident  but you know  my dear  we both   intended to dine abroad to day  so I gave a bill of fare accordingly    and this gentleman came too late to make any addition to what I had   ordered        It may be easily supposed the guest assured them
