of eighteen thousand men  long accustomed to conquer  He found general Lesly at the head of an army far more numerous than his own  but undisciplined and mutinous  After some previous skirmishing  Cromwell saw himself in a very disadvantageous post near Dunbar  and his antagonist ready to take advantage of his incommodious situation  However  perceiving the Scots preparing to give him battle  he assured his soldiers that the Lord had delivered the enemy into his hands  and ordered his army to sing psalms  as already assured of victory    46 The ministers of the Scotch army were not less sanguine in their assurances of victory than he  they boldly promised success in the name of the Lord  and excited a spirit of impatience among the soldiers  Victory  as always before  again declared for Cromwell  who routed the enemy with great slaughter  while he did not lose on his side above forty men in all   Charles  who hated the Scotch army  and only dreaded Cromwell  was well enough pleased at this defeat  It served to introduce him to a greater share in the command than he was before permitted to enjoy  He therefore put himself at the head of that remnant which survived the defeat  and strengthened it by the royalists  who had been before excluded from his service  And now  instead of following Cromwell  who led his victorious troops to Perth  he resolved to seize this opportunity of penetrating into England  where he expected to be joined by numbers there still attached to his interests  His hopes in this were frustrated  his army  on their march  was lessened by continual desertion and disease  Few voluntiers repaired to the royal standard  and he at length saw his vigilant enemy overtaking him at Worcester  Both armies fought with equal intrepidity  but Cromwell was again victorious  Never was so complete a victory obtained by him before  Two thousand perished by the sword  and four times that number  being taken  were sold as slaves to the American planters  The conqueror became master of all Scotland  and set a price of a thousand pounds upon the head of the King   Imagination can scarce conceive dangers mor romantic  or distresses more severe  than those whic attended the young King s escape from Worcester After his hair was cut off  the better to effect hi escape  he worked for some days  disguised as a pea¦sant  at wood cutting  He next made an attemp  47 to retire into Wales  under the conduct of one Pendrell  a poor but faithful companion in his distress  But in this attempt he was disappointed  every pass being guarded to prevent his escape  Being obliged to return  he met one Colonel Careless  who  like himself  had escaped the carnage at Worcester  and it was in his company that he was obliged to climb a spreading oak  among the thick branches of which they passed the day together  while the soldiers of the enemy went underneath in pursuit of him  From thence he passed with imminent danger  feeling all the vicissitudes of famine  fatigue  and pain  to the house of one Mr  Lane  a worthy subject of his  in Staffordshire  Here he deliberated about the means of escaping to France  They agreed that he should ride before this gentleman s daughter  on a visit to one Mrs  Horton  who lived in the neighbourhood of Bristol  During this journey he every day met people whose persons he knew  and once passed through a whole regiment of the parliament army   When they arrived at the house of Mr  Norton  the first person they saw was one of his own chaplains  sitting at the door  amusing himself with seeing people play at bowls  The King  after having taken proper care of his horse in the stable  was shewn to an apartment which Mrs  Lane had provided for him  upon pretence of indisposition  The butler  being sent to him with some refreshment  no sooner beheld his countenance  which was now very pale with anxiety and fatigue  than he recollected the visage of his King and Master  and falling upon his knees  while the tears streamed down his cheeks  he cried out     I am rejoiced to see your Majesty    The King enjoined him secrecy  and the honest servant punctually kept his word  Having staid some days in this place  he repaired to the house of Colonel Wyndham  where he was cordially received    48 that gentleman s family having ever been noted for loyalty  Pursuing his route to the sea side  he once more had a very providential escape from the little inn at which he lodged  It happened to be a solemn fast  and a fanatical weaver  who had fought in the parliament army  was preaching against the King  in a chapel fronting the house  Charles was actually one of the audience  A farrier of the same principles  who had been examining the horses belonging to the passengers  came to assure the preacher  that he knew by the fashion of the shoes that one of the stranger s horses came from the North  The preacher instantly affirmed  that this horse could belong to no other than Charles Stewart  and went immediately with a constable to the house
