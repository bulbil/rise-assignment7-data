task  therefore  was not so great in comforting him  as in  consoling his own sister  who  with great poignancy and sincerity  of grief  lamented the death of the only relation with whom she had  maintained any intimacy of correspondence  for her mother was as  implacable as ever  in her enmity against her and Peregrine  and rather  more determined in her rancour  that which was originally a sudden  transport of indignation  being by this time settled into a confirmed  inveteracy of hate  As for Gam  who was now dignified by the country  people with the appellation of the young squire  he still acted in the  capacity of minister to the caprice and vengeance of his mother   taking all opportunities of disturbing Julia s peace  slandering her  reputation  and committing outrages against the tenants and domestics of  her husband  who was a man of quiet and timorous disposition   But the chief amusement of young Pickle  in his later years  was  the chase  in which he acquired some renown by his intrepidity and  remarkable figure  which improved every day in deformity  insomuch   as to suggest a ludicrous scheme of revenge to a gentleman in the  neighbourhood  Having been affronted by the insolence of Crookback   he clothed a large baboon that was in his possession  in a dress that  resembled the hunting equipage of Gam  and ordering the animal to be set  astride  and tied upon the back of his keenest hunter  turned them out  one day after the hounds  The horse in a little time outstripping all  the rest in the field  the rider was mistaken for Gam by the whole  company  who saluted him as he passed with a halloo  observing  that  the squire had his usual good luck  in being better mounted than his  neighbours  Pickle afterwards appearing in his own person  created  great astonishment in the spectators  one of whom asked if he had split  himself in twain  and pointed out his representative  who was  by this  time  almost up with the hounds  Upon which the identical Gam went in  pursuit of the impostor  When he overtook him  he was so much enraged at  the counterfeit  that he attacked the baboon whip in hand  and  in all  probability  would have sacrificed him to his resentment  had not he  been prevented by the other fox hunters  They interposed  in order  to make up the difference betwixt two brothers of the sport  and were  equally surprised and diverted when they distinguished the quality of  Crookback s antagonist  which they rescued from his rage  and reconveyed  to its master   Peregrine  at the request of his friend Jack  took charge of his aunt s  funeral  to which his parents were invited  though they did not think  proper to appear  or pay the least regard to his solicitations  when  he desired permission to wait upon them in person  Nevertheless  old    6 22 15  3 45 PM   Gamaliel  at the instigation of his wife  afterwards obtained an order  from Doctors  Commons  obliging Hatchway to produce the will of his  wife  on the supposition that she had bequeathed to him some part of the  money  which  he knew  was at her own disposal  But from this step he  reaped no other satisfaction than that of finding himself altogether  neglected by the testatrix  who had left all her effects to her husband   except one thousand pounds  with her jewels  to Julia s daughter   the benefaction mentioned in the lieutenant s letter  and some  inconsiderable legacies to her favourite domestics   A few days after the interment of this good lady  our hero was agreeably  surprised with a visit from his friend Godfrey  who had come to England  in consequence of that promotion which he owed to his interest  though  the soldier himself placed it to the credit of a certain courtier who  had formerly promised to befriend him  and now finding his advancement  unowned  very modestly arrogated the merit of it to himself  He  communicated his good fortune to Pickle  who complimented him upon it as  an event of which he had no precognition  and at the same time told  him  that  in consequence of his preferment  his cousin at Windsor had  consented to his being immediately united in the bands of wedlock with  his lovely Sophy  that the wedding day was already fixed  and that  nothing would be wanting to his happiness  if Peregrine would honour the  nuptials with his presence   Our hero accepted the invitation with great eagerness  when he learned  that Emilia would be there in quality of bridesmaid  and now repeated  what he had formerly written to his friend  namely  that he was not only  willing  but extremely impatient to atone for his mad behaviour to that  young lady  by laying himself and his whole fortune at her feet  Godfrey  thanked him for his honourable intention  and promised to use his  influence  and that of Sophy  in his behalf  though he seemed dubious
