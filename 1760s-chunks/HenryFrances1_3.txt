the foregoing Letter  to private History  or private Business   The Editor of St  Evremond s Works speaks as follows  in Part of his Preface to the third Volume    One of the Objections made to this Author is that odd Medley of serious and comical  of grave Matters and Trifles  which is to be met with in his Writings  Would it not have been sufficient  say certain austere and difficult Persons  to have made a Collection of all that is good and solid  Why was not every  Thing left out  that is not only useless but waggish       Those People who would have us apply ourselves only to useful Studies  ought to consider  that our Author is a Doctor  who writes to instruct and dogmatize  and that he is not a Man engaged by his Profession   xv to give the Publick an Account of his Time and Studies  He is a Gentleman  who having much Leisure  seeks how to pass away the Time agreeably  who writes sometimes on one Subject  sometimes on another  only for his own Amusement  He is a Man of Wit  who proposes to divert himself  as well as certain Persons  with whom he converses  It would most certainly be unjust to judge of him with too much Rigour  and the Injustice would be yet greater  to oblige those  who publish his Works  to suppress all such as are purely diverting     So much  by Way of Apology  both for my Authors and myself  for I think the above Quotation is applicable  thro  the Whole  to our Case   As to the Chasms  I cannot barely say Nonnulla defunt  but Hiatus valdé deflendi  and when I declared my Design of publishing  and applied a second Time to have the Chain connected  I was told  by Henry  that he thought it not fair Dealing with the Publick  that besides  he thought they appeared  at present  more genuine than a complete   xvi Suite of Letters would do  and farther said  that if the regular Series had been preserved from the Beginning  he would take out an Handful  here and there at random  and throw them into the Fire  lest it might be suspected that they were wrote  or preserved  with a Design of publishing  as he was humble enough to think that they could have but very little Merit in this View  In Allusion to which  he told me a Story of a certain Lady  who  upon reading over a Letter she had wrote  about Business  to a Gentleman  and thinking it too Orthographical for a Woman  added an  e  to the Ende of severale Wordse  leste it should bee suspected that she had spelte by the Aid of a Dictionarye   This Whim of his  which however may be justified from a thorough Knowledge of Mankind  puts me in mind of the virtuoso Taste for mutilated Statues  and time eaten Coins  where the Parts which remain  rise in Value in Proportion to those which are lost  or to the Dutch device of burning half their Spices  in order to inhance the Price of the rest     xviiBut I was  at length  of Opinion with him in not framing any Letters to supply the Chasms  because it would  as he observed  be disingenuous to give the Publick any Thing  in this Collection  which was not Original  therefore I have not  as I said before  even taken the Liberty  which the Authors paid me the high Compliment of indulging me in  of altering any one Sentence  which I thought might be better expressed  or displacing any Argument which I presumed might  perhaps  be put in a stronger Light  for certainly any Person  of a curious Taste  would rather see a true Copy of any Classick s original Text  though incorrect  than read all Bentleii Emendationes   However  I have thrown in a Note  here  and there  to explain the Occasion upon which some of the Letters were wrote  and to clear up some particular Passages or Allusions  which might not  perhaps  be intelligibe to every Reader  I have also arranged the Letters according to the Numbers  which are prescribed in the foregoing Letter  and these are all the Merits which I   xviii claim to myself  except the Publication  in the Course of the following Collection   As I know nothing of the Lady  but from her Writings  I am not enabled to give any particular Account of her private History  except that she is of a Gentleman s Family  and had a very genteel Education  but was left  very young  without a Father  and without a Fortune  She is —but Henry himself will better tell you what she is  and making poetical Allowances for the Hyperbole of his warm Manner of expressing himself in her Favour  I do not think he has at all exaggerated her Praise  And if his Writings do not sufficiently describe her Worth  I could supply their Deficiency to the entire Satisfaction of the World  if I was at Liberty to tell them who Lady O— is  and that she received her early into her Matronage and Friendship  from no
