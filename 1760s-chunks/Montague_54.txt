my dear Lucy  that there is a little impertinent girl here  a Mademoiselle Clairaut  who  on the meer merit of features and complexion  sets up for being as handsome as Emily and me       If beauty  as I will take the liberty to assert  is given us for the purpose of pleasing  she who pleases most  that is to say  she who excites the most passion  is to all intents and purposes the most beautiful woman  and  in this case  I am inclined to believe your little Bell stands pretty high on the roll of beauty  the men s eyes may perhaps say she is handsome  but their hearts feel that I am so       There is  in general  nothing so insipid  so uninteresting  as a beauty  which those men experience to their cost  who chuse from vanity  not inclination  I remember Sir Charles Herbert  a Captain in the same regiment with my father  who determined to marry Miss Raymond before he saw her  merely because he had been told she was a celebrated beauty  though she was never known to have inspired a real passion  he saw her  not with his own eyes  but those of the public  took her charms on trust  and  till he was her husband  never found out she was not his taste  a secret  however  of some little importance to his happiness       I have  however  known some beauties who had a right to please  that is  who had a mixture of that invisible charm  that nameless grace which by no means depends on beauty  and which strikes the heart in a moment  but my first aversion is your fine women  don t you think a fine woman a detestable creature  Lucy  I do  they are vastly well to fill public places  but as to the heart Heavens  my dear  yet there are men  I suppose  to be found  who have a taste for the great sublime in beauty       Men are vastly foolish  my dear  very few of them have spirit to think for themselves  there are a thousand Sir Charles Herberts  I have seen some of them weak enough to decline marrying the woman on earth most pleasing to themselves  because not thought handsome by the generality of their companions       Women are above this folly  and therefore chuse much oftener from affection than men  We are a thousand times wiser  Lucy  than these important beings  these mighty lords     Who strut and fret their hour upon the stage    and  instead of playing the part in life which nature dictates to their reason and their hearts  act a borrowed one at the will of others         I had rather even judge ill  than not judge for myself       Adieu  yours ever   A  FERMOR     LETTER LXXXIII   83   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Quebec  March 4   AFTER debating with myself some days  I am determined to pursue Emily  but  before I make a declaration  will go to see some ungranted lands at the back of Madame Des Roches s estate  which  lying on a very fine river  and so near the St  Lawrence  may I think be cultivated at less expence than those above Lake Champlain  though in a much inferior climate  if I make my settlement here  I will purchase the estate Madame Des Roches has to sell  which will open me a road to the river St  Lawrence  and consequently treble the value of my lands       I love  I adore this charming woman  but I will not suffer my tenderness for her to make her unhappy  or to lower her station in life  if I can  by my present plan  secure her what will in this country be a degree of affluence  I will endeavor to change her friendship for me into a tenderer and more lively affection  if she loves  I know by my own heart  that Canada will be no longer a place of exile  if I have flattered myself  and she has only a friendship for me  I will return immediately to England  and retire with you and my mother to our little estate in the country       You will perhaps say  why not make Emily of our party  I am almost ashamed to speak plain  but so weak are we  and so guided by the prejudices we fancy we despise  that I cannot bear my Emily  after refusing a coach and six  should live without an equipage suitable at least to her birth  and the manner in which she has always lived when in England       I know this is folly  that it is a despicable pride  but it is a folly  a pride  I cannot conquer       There are moments when I am above all this childish prejudice  but it returns upon me in spite of myself       Will you come to us  my Lucy  Tell my mother  I will build her a rustic palace  and settle a little principality on you both       I make this a private excursion
