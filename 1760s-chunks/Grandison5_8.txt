have been agreeable to him  to find out there half of the objects of his benevolence  Why else named he France in his Will   The intention of the bequeather  in doubtful cases  ought always to be considered  And another case has offered  which  I think  as there is a large surplus in my hands  after having done by his relations more than they expected  and full as much as is necessary  to put them in a flourishing way  I ought to consider in that light   Mr  Danby  at his setting out in life  owed great obligations to a particular family  then in affluent circumstances  This family fell  by unavoidable accidents  into decay  Its descendents were numerous  Mr  Danby used to confer on no less than six granddaughters  and four grandsons  of this family  an annual bounty  which kept them just above want  And he had put them in hopes  that he would cause it to be continued to them  as long as they were unprovided for  The elder girls were in services  the Page  20 younger were brought up to be qualified for the same useful way of life  The sons were neither idle nor vicious  I cannot but think  that it was his intention to continue his bounty to them by his last will  had he not forgot them when he gave orders for drawing it up  which was not till he thought himself in a dying way   Proper enquiries have been made  and this affair is settled  The numerous family think themselves happy  And the supposed intention of my deceased friend is fully answered  and no Legatee a sufferer   You kindly  my dear Dr  Bartlett  regret the distance we are at from each other  I am the loser by it  and not you  since I give you  by pen and ink  almost as minute an account of my proceedings  as I could do were we conversing together  Such are your expectations upon  and such is the obedience of   Your ever affectionate and filial Friend  CHARLES GRANDISON   LETTER III  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  In Continuation   June 12 23   WE have now  thank God  some hopes of our Jeronymo  The opening made below the great wound answers happily its intention  and that in the shoulder is once more in a fine way   Lady Clementina has been made to understand  that he is better  and this good news  and the method she is treated with  partly in pursuance of the advice of the English physicians  leave us not without hopes of her recovery   The General and his Lady are gone to Naples  in much higher spirits than when they left that city  Page  21 His Lady seconding his earnest invitation  I was not able to deny them the promise of a visit there   Every one endeavours to sooth and humour Lady Clementina  and the whole Family is now satisfied  that this was the method which always ought to have been taken with her  and lay to the charge of Lady Sforza and Laurana  perhaps much deeper views than they had at first  tho  they might enlarge them afterwards  and certainly did extend them  when the poor Lady was deemed irrecoverable   Let me account to you  my dear friend  for my silence of near a month since the date of my last   For a fortnight together  I was every day once with Lady Clementina  She took no small pleasure in seeing me  She was very various all that time in her absences  sometimes she had sensible intervals  but they were not durable  She generally rambled much  and was very incoherent  Sometimes she fell into her silent fits  But they seldom lasted long when I came  Sometimes she aimed to speak to me in English  But her ideas were too much unfixed  and her memory too much shattered  to make herself understood for a sentence together  in the tongue she had so lately learned  and for some time disused  Yet  on the whole  her reason seemed to gather strength  It was a heavy fortnight to me  and the heavier  as I was not very well myself—Yet I was loth to forbear my daily visits   Mrs  Beaumont  at the fortnight s end  made the family and me a visit of three days  In that space  Lady Clementina s absences were stronger  but less frequent than before   I had  by Letter  been all this time preparing the persons who had the management of Mr  Jervois s affairs  to adjust  finally  the account relating to his estate  which remained unsettled  and they let me know  that they were quite ready to put the last hand to them  It was necessary for me to attend those gentlemen Page  22 in person  And as Mrs  Beaumont could not conveniently stay any longer than the three days  I acquainted the Marchioness  that I should do myself the honour of attending her to Florence   As well Mrs  Beaumont  as the Marchioness  and the Bishop  thought I should communicate my intention  and the necessity of pursuing it  to Lady Clementina  lest  on her missing me
