from Brussels  but without my  clothes  which were detained on account of the money I owed in that  place  and  asking her dismission from my service  set up shop for  herself  I had not lived many weeks in my new habitation  when my  persecutor renewed his attempts to make himself master of my person   but I had learned from experience to redouble my vigilance  and he was  frustrated in all his endeavours  I was again happy in the conversation  of my former acquaintance  and visited by a great number of gentlemen   mostly persons of probity and sense  who cultivated my friendship   without any other motive of attachment  Not that I was unsolicited on  the article of love  That was a theme on which I never wanted orators   and could I have prevailed upon myself to profit by the advances that  were made  I might have managed my opportunities so as to have set  fortune at defiance for the future  But I was none of these economists  who can sacrifice their hearts to interested considerations    One evening  while I was conversing with three or four of my friends   my lawyer came in  and told me he had something of consequence to  impart  upon which all the gentlemen but one went away  Then he gave me  to understand  that my suit would immediately come to trial  and  though  he hoped the best  the issue was uncertain  That  if it should be given  against me  the decision would inspire my lord with fresh spirits to  disturb my peace  and  therefore  it would be convenient for me to  retire  until the affair should be brought to a determination     6 22 15  3 45 PM    I was very much disconcerted at this intelligence  and the gentleman  who stayed  perceiving my concern  asked what I intended to do  or if he  could serve me in any shape  and desired to know whither I proposed to  retreat  I affected to laugh  and answered   To a garret  I believe   To  this overstrained reasoning he replied  that if I should  his friendship  and regard would find the way to my apartment  and I had no reason to  doubt the sincerity of his declaration  We consulted about the measures  I should take  and I determined to remove into the country  where I was  soon favoured with a letter from him  wherein he expressed the infinite  pleasure he had in being able to assure me that my suit had been  successful  and that I might appear again with great safety    Accordingly  I returned to town in his coach and six  which he had  sent for my convenience  and the same evening went with him to the  masquerade  where we passed the night very agreeably  his spirits  as  well as mine  being elevated to a joyous pitch by the happy event of  my process  This gentleman was a person of great honour  worth  and  good nature  he loved me extremely  but did not care that I should know  the extent of his passion  On the contrary  he endeavoured to persuade  me  he had laid it down as a maxim  that no woman should ever have power  enough over his heart to give him the least pain or disquiet  In short   he had made a progress in my affection  and to his generosity was  I indebted for my subsistence two whole years  during which  he was  continually professing this philosophic indifference  while  at the same  time  he was giving me daily assurances of his friendship and esteem   and treated me with incessant marks of the most passionate love  so  that I concluded his intention was cold  though his temper was warm   Considering myself as an encumbrance upon his fortune  I redoubled my  endeavours to obtain a separate maintenance from my lord  and removed  from St  James s square to lodgings at Kensington  where I had not  long enjoyed myself in tranquility  before I was interrupted by a very  unexpected visit    While I was busy one day dressing in my dining room  I found his  lordship at my elbow before I was aware of his approach  although his  coach was at the door  and the house already in the possession of his  servants  He accosted me in the usual style  as if we had parted the  night before  and I answered him with an appearance of the same careless  familiarity  desiring him to sit down  while I retreated to my chamber   locked the door  and fairly went to bed  being perhaps the first woman  who went thither for protection from the insults of a man  Here  then   I immured myself with my faithful Abigail  My lord finding me secured   knocked at the door  and through the keyhole begged to be admitted   assuring me that all he wanted was a conference  I desired to be  excused  though I believed his assurance  but I had no inclination to
