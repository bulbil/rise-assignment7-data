to imagine me  more happy than I am     At some Distance from this Town  I amused myself with one of the most curious Pieces of exquisite bad Taste  I have ever met with  and which put me in Mind of that Epistle of Pope s which we read together  the other Evening  It was the deceptio visûs of a Ship in Sail  on the Top of a Mountain  which  I suppose  terminated the Visto of some absurd Fellow s Unimprovement thereabouts  which shews Mistress Johnson s Expression    hinted in one of your Letters  tho  a Tautology in Sense  not so much so in Terms  This may be ranked among the   50 unnatural Pleasures  I mentioned to you lately  with which the Daemon of Caprice has possessed the human Brutes of this World  The curious Artist too  lest any of his Merit should be lost  by the natural Appearance of the Object  had placed it on the left Hand  while the Sea was roaring on the Right  that the paltry Contrivance might be obvious to the meanest Capacity  or  if there was any Design to deceive the View  it was  by fixing the Ship among a Parcel of horrid Rocks  so that one might suggest to himself a shocking Object of Distress  thrown up there  by the Raging of a Tempest  or the Violence of an Earthquake  which but heighthened the Idea of false Taste  and put me in Mind of several famous Pieces of Painting  which have displeased me greatly  such as Storms  Battles  Cities on Fire  Executions  chained Slaves   c  which I never could endure the Contemplation of  for a Moment  The only Thing  which can recommend  in such Pieces  is  their being well drawn  but this only renders them still more shocking  as a bad Man needs but Sense and Courage  to be a Devil   There are some much admired Passages in Poetry  which I am dissatisfied with  for the same Reason  and that a Relish for such Things is an Instance of false Taste  I think may be deduced from this one Reflection  that Providence   51 has so wisely and justly ordained it  that nothing  which gives us Pain  can possibly give us Pleasure  except overcoming the Distempers of the Body  or the Vices of the Mind   Adieu   my dear Moralist   and believe me  ever Your s  Henry   LETTER XXXV   My Dear FANNY   I DID not mean to trouble you  about such a Trifle  at a Time you were ill  and only desired Tom to ask where you had bought the Silk  that he might match the Colour  Let me know what the Charge is  that I may not owe you paltry Debts  already so bound and mortgaged to you   I am extremely sorry  any Thing in my Letter should provoke you  or make you uneasy  tho  I need not make any Apology for being guilty of an Error  any body  who knows you  might be led into  the Believing you never say or do any Thing without a Meaning  or Design  What I hinted at  were Passages out of your own Letter  and tho   upon my Honour  I did not take them seriously  I thought  at least  you meant to make me uneasy by them  and    52 not having the Malice to disappoint the Design  I thought it would be some Amusement to my little Snap Dragon  to find her Scheme was answered   You have a Right  I think  and a Power  I swear  to make me uneasy  whenever you please  and I shall henceforward never repine at your Prerogative  but when you extend it  as you often do  to the cruel Height of rendering yourself unhappy in Health or Spirits  which is a Method of wounding me  beyond the Power of Temper or Philosophy   I am   my dearest Fanny   because I would not help it  if I could   Your s eternally  Henry   LETTER XXXVI   WHEN my dear Harry left Town  I flattered myself  that I should enjoy   a cool Suspence from Pleasure and from Pain   and that I should recover my shattered Spirits and broken Constitution  firmly resolved to live soberly  quietly  and righteously  all the Days of my Life  But  see the strange Perverseness of my Stars  more in Fault  than I  which drive me on the Rock  I thought to shun  for   53 I have not been one Evening at Home  since I saw you  but have been continually immersed in Noise  Folly  and Hurry  dragged about in melancholy Parties of Pleasure  where  as Pope says   I sit  with sad Civility  I hear   With honest Anguish  and an aching Ear     And surely it is a Vice  which the Devil was not Fool enough to recommend  to sacrifice one s Life and Health  without some Joy in doing it  I wish you had died three Years ago  for  if I had not known you  the now
