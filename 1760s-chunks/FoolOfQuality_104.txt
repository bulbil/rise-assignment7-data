insisted that  till this was   done  neither she nor Arabella should come to my prison  and that   I had given express orders that they should not be admitted      Alas   had they complied with my directions  how happy might   we have been all together at this day   But the excess of their   goodness was the cause of our common ruin  Their affection would   not be satisfied with simple bail   and they resolved never to rest   till they had procured my full discharge      They went about to all their customers of any distinction  They   solicited  petitioned  and bribed without measure  They borrowed   money to the utmost extent of their credit  and pawned or sold   all their effects under prime cost  They gave a purse to one to   bring them acquainted with another  on whom they bestowed a   larger sum to introduce them to a third  Having at length made   their way to Lord Stivers  an agent of the minister  he thought he   saw an advantage in granting their request  and my discharge was   made out without further delay      On the fifth evening from my imprisonment the door of my   chamber opened  and in came my dear aunt with my dearer   Arabella they flew upon me they clasped me on each side in   their arms  and my wife instantly swooned away upon my bosom    She soon revived  however  at the known voice of love  and as   every door for my enlargement had been previously opened  we   went down  stepped into the coach  and drove home directly      Here I saw the first subject and cause of alarm the shop was   shut up  I was shocked  and felt a sudden chillness come upon   me  but did not venture to inquire  except by my eyes      The kettle being down  and all seated to tea  I introduced the   affair with an affected unconcern  and  by question after question    artfully extracted from my companions the whole history and ad    ventures of the five preceding days  whereby I found that they had   expended in my behalf beyond the last penny of their own sub    stance   and that nothing remained save one hundred and fifty   pounds  to which the several deposits amounted  which I had made   with Mrs  Graves      I could now no longer contain myself  Cruel woman inhuman   friends   I cried   the bitterness of enmity  the rancour of malice    could never have brought an evil like this upon me  Accursed   wretch that I am   ordained to be the instrument of perdition to   those whom I would feed with my blood and foster with my vitals      Would to heaven I had not been born   or would I had been cut   off by some quick and horrid judgment ere this had happened       Here Mrs  Graves drew her chair close to mine  and catching   me about the neck  and dropping upon me a few tears  that she   struggled to suppress Do not grieve  my child  she cried   do not   afflict yourself for nothing  All is as it should be  There is no   harm done  Your Arabella and I can always earn genteel and in    dependent bread  without shop or other means than the work of   our hands  We can never want  my Hammy  We have done         86 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      nothing for you  Neither has any thing happened wherewith you   ought to reproach yourself  What we did was for ourselves  for   the relief of the anguish of our own hearts   to bring you home   to us again as soon as possible  my son  since we have found that   we could live no longer without you      Within a few days I perceived that my dear aunt began to   decline in her health  perhaps occasioned by her late fatigue and   anxiety of spirits  I brought an able physician to her  but he   could form no judgment of the nature of her disorder  till some time   after  when her complexion began to change  and the doctor de    clared her to be in the jaundice  He began to apply to the   customary medicines  and no care nor expense was spared for her   recovery  Arabella and I sat up with her alternately every night    and all the day we read to her some book of amusement  in order   to dissipate the melancholy of her disease  But  alas   all our cares   and remedies  our attention and solicitude  our prayers and tears    proved equally unsuccessful  and
