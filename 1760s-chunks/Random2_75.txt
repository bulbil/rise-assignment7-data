and complacency in her reproof  that I became as much enamoured of her understanding  as I had been before of her beauty  and asked pardon for my presumption with the utmost reverence of conviction—She forgave my offence with her usual affability  and sealed my pardon with a look so full of bewitching tenderness  that for some minutes  my senses were lost in exstasy  I afterwards endeavoured to regulate my behaviour according to her desire  and turn the conversation upon a more indifferent subject  but her presence was an unsurmountable obstacle to my design  while I behold so much excellence  I found it impossible to call my attention from the contemplation of it  I gazed with unutterable fondness  I grew mad with admiration —   My condition is unsupportable  cried I  I am distracted with passion  why are you so exquisitely fair —Why are you so enchantingly good —Why has nature dignified you with charms so much above the standard of woman  and  wretch that I am  how dares my unworthiness aspire to the enjoyment of such perfection      She was startled at my ravings  reasoned down my transport  and by her irresistible eloquence  soothed my soul into a state of tranquil felicity  but lest I might suffer a relapse  industriously promoted other subjects to entertain my imagination—she chid me for having omitted to inquire about her aunt  who  she assured me  in the midst of all her absence of temper  and detachment from common affairs  often talked of me with uncommon warmth —I professed my veneration for the   221 good lady  excused my omission  by imputing it to the violence of my love  which engrossed my whole soul  and desired to know the present situation of her health —Upon which  the amiable Narcissa repeated what I had heard before  of her marriage  with all the tenderness for her reputation that the subject would admit of  told me  she liv d with her husband  hard by  and was so much afflicted with a dropsy  and wasted by a consumption  that she had small hopes of her recovery —Having expressed my sorrow for her distemper  I questioned her about my good friend Mrs  Sagely  who I learned  to my great satisfaction  was still in good health  and by the encomiums she bestowed upon me after I was gone  confirmed the favourable impression  my behaviour at parting had made on Narcissa s heart—This circumstance introduced an inquiry into the conduct of Sir Timothy Thicket  who  she informed me  had found means to incense her brother so much against me  that she found it impossible to undeceive him  but on the contrary  suffered very much in her own character  by his scandalous insinuations—that the whole parish was alarmed  and actually in pursuit of me  so that she had been in the utmost consternation upon my account  well knowing how little my own innocence and her testimony would have weighed with the ignorance  prejudice and brutality of those  who must have judged me  had I been apprehended—that Sir Timothy being seized with a fit of the apoplexy  from which with great difficulty he was recovered  began to be apprehensive of death  and to prepare himself accordingly for that great event  as a step to which  he sent for her brother  owned with great contrition    222 the brutal design he had upon her  and of consequence acquitted me of the assault  robbery and correspondence with her  which he had laid to my charge  after which confession he lived about a month in a languishing condition  and was carried off by a second assault   Every word that this dear creature spoke  rivetted the chains with which she held me enslaved  My mischievous fancy began to work  and the tempest of my passion to wake again  when the return of Freeman destroyed the tempting opportunity  and enabled me to quell the rising tumult —A little while after  the Squire staggered into the room  rubbing his eyes  and called for his tea  which he drank out of a small bowl  qualified with brandy  we sipped some in the ordinary way  Narcissa left us in order to visit her aunt  and when Freeman and I proposed to take our leave  the fox hunter insisted on our spending the evening at his house with such obstinacy of affection  that we were obliged to comply —For my own part  I should have been glad of the invitation  by which  in all likelihood  I would be blest with his sister s company  had I not been afraid of risking her esteem  by entering into a debauch of drinking with him  which  from the knowledge of his character  I foresaw would happen  but there was no remedy—I was forced to rely upon the strength of my constitution  which I hoped would resist intoxication longer than the Squire s  and to trust to the good nature and discretion of my mistress for the rest   Our entertainer resolving to begin by times  ordered the table to be furnished with liquor and glasses immediately after tea  but we absolutely   223 refused to set in for drinking so soon  and prevailed upon him to pass away an hour or two at whist  in which we engaged as soon as Narcissa returned —The savage and I happened to be partners at
