disclose such secrets as I have trusted    you with  I do not fear your imprudence with regard to any one else  but it is of the utmost importance to me that He in particular should never know what my tenderness for you has led me into  You know I have a son by him  he has hitherto provided liberally for the child’s maintenance  and to let you into a secret  which nobody besides must know  I myself am indebted to him for the principal part of my support  though he  as well as the rest of the world  believe that I have a fortune  Now though I do not entertain the least hope  nor indeed wish  ever to be Mr Faulkland’s wife  yet would it be of terrible consequence to me to forfeit his regard  which you may naturally suppose would be the case if he were to come to the knowlege of what has happened  He has given me to understand by his house keeper that when he comes to England he will provide for me  the woman hinted something like a design of his making a handsome establishment for any worthy man of whom I should make choice  insinuating at the same time that this depended on my conduct  I have no thoughts of marrying  but as mine and my child’s future welfare must be chiefly owing to Mr Faulkland  you see the necessity there is for my preserving his good opinion  For this reason then  my dear Sir George  you must swear to me that you will never betray me to him   The reasons were so plausible  and the request so natural  that I made no scruple of giving her a solemn oath to preserve the secret inviolable from Mr Faulkland’s knowledge  for so she herself worded the promise she urged me to make  in regard to any one else  she said she was satisfied all assurances were needless   You see  continued my brother that by this declaration she laid me under a double tye of secrecy  As I had no conception that Faulkland could ever be brought to think of marrying her  I thought myself bound not to injure her in his opinion  and therefore religiously kept my promise  Faulkland was not then in England  but when returned  and came to visit me at Sidney castle  just at the time you parted from your husband  he spoke of Miss Burchell in a manner  which though it convinced me he had a regard for her  and wished to see her happy  yet was it far from alarming me on his account  I therefore should have thought it the highest baseness and cruelty to have hurt her in his esteem   I never have had the least intercourse  either by letter  or otherwise  with Miss Burchell  since we parted  I make no doubt but she has dispensed her favours wherever her inclination has led her     and you see she has had the good fortune to keep all her amours secret  But what hope can there be that such a profligate will keep her faith to one man  though that man is the most amiable in the world   Oh brother  what a scene of iniquity have you disclosed  I would to Heaven you had kept the horrid secret to yourself  or divulged it time enough to have prevented the misery into which I  unhappy that I am  have precipitated your friend  But I ought not to blame you  you acted agreeably to the dictates of honour  Detestable woman  I cried in the bitterness of my heart  I do not wonder at her cautioning me against letting you into my design of urging Mr Faulkland to marry her  I then little knew the reason you had for the opposition she said you would give to this fatal match  every thing fell out to her wish  and coincided to promote her successful guilt —Your absence from London  mine  and my mother’s urgency  and the too generous yielding of our dear unhappy Faulkland  I burst into tears—my heart was torn with anguish  and in that instant my tenderness for him revived  Sir George strove not to comfort me  He was too much affected himself   I have but one hope  said I  and that is in the extraordinary love she has for Mr Faulkland  and his uncommon merit  which may probably ensure to him the continuance of it   You know not what you say  answered my brother  the merit of an angel could not secure the fidelity of such a heart as her’s  Her love is gross  a new object will always have charms for her  Had I been as credulous as Faulkland  I should have thought myself the idol of her soul  so lavish was she in her expressions of tenderness   Is it not strange though  I asked  that with so loose a mind  she should have so long preserved an attachment to Mr Faulkland  for most certainly her affection to him has at least been sincere   Her affection to his estate  answered my brother  has  I believe  all along been sincere  Do you not know she is a beggar   I told him  in this she had imposed on him  to answer her own ends  in engaging him the more firmly to keep her secret
