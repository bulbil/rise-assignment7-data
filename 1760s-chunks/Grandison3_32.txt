artful woman s heart  Nothing can be weaker  in the eye of an observer  who himself disdains artifice  than a woman who makes artifice her study  In such a departure from honest nature  there will be such curvings  that the eyes  the countenance  must ever betray the heart  while the lips  either breaking out into apologies  or aiming at reserve  confirm the suspicion  that all is not right in the mind   I excuse you  Mrs  Giffard  said I  my Lord has deservedly brought much of what has distressed him  upon himself  But now it is best for you to part  My Lord chooses not to see you  I would advise you to remove this very afternoon     78 What  Sir  and not have my 250l  a year   Will you leave the house this night  if I give you my word—  For the whole sum  Sir —Two hundred and fifty pounds a year  Sir   Yes  for the whole sum   I will  Sir  with all my heart and soul  Most of my things are in the conntry  My Lord came up in a passion  to talk with you  Sir  Two or three bandboxes are all I have here  Mr  Halden  he is my Lord s favourite  shall go down  and see I take nothing but my own—I will trust to your word of honour  Sir—and leave  for ever  the most ungrateful—  Hush  Mrs  Giffard  these tears are tears of passion  There is not a female feature  at this instant  in your face— What a command of countenance  It cleared up in a moment  I expected it from her  A penitent spirit is an humble  a broken spirit  You shew  at present  no sign of it   She dropt me a courtesy  with such an air  tho  not designed  I believe   as shewed that the benefit she was to reap from the advice  would not be sudden  if ever  and immediately repeated her question  If she had my honour for the payment of the entire sum—And you don t insist  Sir   I have poor relations  that I shall pay out the hundred a year  as you mentioned   You are to do with the whole annuity as you please  If your relations are worthy  you cannot do better than to relieve their necessities  But remember  Mrs  Giffard  that every quarter brings you the wages of iniquity  and endeavour at some atonement   The woman could too well bear this severity   Had a finger been sufficient to have made her feel  I would not have laid upon her the weight of my whole hand   She assured me  that she would leave the house in two hours time  and I returned to my Lord  and told him so     79 He got up  and embraced me  and called me his good Angel  I advised him to give his orders to Halden  or to whom he thought sit  to do her and himself justice  as to what belonged to her in the country   But the terms  the terms  cried my Lord  If you have brought me off for 150 l  I will adore you   These are the terms  You promised to leave them to me   You pay no more than 150 l  a year for her life  till you assure me  upon your honour  that you chearfully  and on mature consideration  make it up 250 l   How is that  How is that  nephew —Then I never shall pay more  depend upon it   Nor will I ever ask you   He rubbed his hands  forgetting the gout  but was remembered by the pain  and cried  Oh —  But how did you manage it  kinsman —I never should have brought her to any thing  How did you manage it   Your Lordship does not repent her going   He swore  that it was the happiest event that could have befallen him  I hope  said  he  she will go without wishing to see me  Whether she would whine  or curse  it would be impossible for me to see her  and be myself   I believe she will go without desiring to see you  perhaps while I am here   Thank God  a fair riddance  Thank God   But is it possible  kinsman  that you could bring me off for 150 l  a year  Tell me  truly   It is  And I tell your Lordship  that it shall cost you no more  till you shall know how to value the comfort and happiness of your future life at more than 100 l  a year  Till then  the respect I pay to my mother s brother  and the regard I have for his honour  will make me chearfully pay the 100 l  a year in dispute  out of my own pocket     80 He looked around him  his head turning as if on a pivot  and  at last  bursting out into tears and speech together—And is it thus  Is
