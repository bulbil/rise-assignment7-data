door  conveyed me to my lord s lodgings in  Gloucester street  Upon this occasion  his lordship courageously drew  his sword upon my woman  who attempted to defend me from his insults   and  in all probability  would have intimidated him from proceeding  for  he looked pale and aghast  his knees knocked together  and he breathed  thick and hard  with his nostrils dilated  as if he had seen a  ghost  but he was encouraged by his mercenary associate  who  for the  five and twenty pounds  stood by him in the day of trouble  and spirited  him on to this gallant enterprise    In consequence of this exploit  I was cooped up in a paltry apartment  in Gloucester street  where I was close beset by his lordship and his  worthy steward Mr  H    with a set of servants that were the creatures  of this fellow  of whom my lord himself stood in awe  so that I could    6 22 15  3 45 PM   not help thinking myself in Newgate  among thieves and ruffians  To such  a degree did my terror avail  that I actually believed I was in danger  of being poisoned  and would not receive any sustenance  except from the  hands of one harmless looking fellow  a foreigner  who  was my lord s  valet de chambre  I will not pretend to say my fears were just  but such  was my opinion of H    that I never doubted he would put me out of the  way  if he thought my life interfered with his interest  On the second  day of my imprisonment  I was visited by the duke of L    a friend of  my lord  who found me sitting upon a trunk  in a poor little diningroom  filled with lumber  and lighted with two bits of tallow candle  which  had been left overnight  He perceived in my face a mixture of rage   indignation  terror  and despair  He compassionated my sufferings   though he could not alleviate my distress any other way than by  interceding with my tyrant to mitigate my oppression  Nevertheless  I  remained eleven days in this uncomfortable situation  I was watched  like a criminal all day  and one of the servants walked from one room to  another all night  in the nature of a patrol  while my lord  who lay in  the chamber above me  got out of bed and tripped to the window at the  sound of every coach that chanced to pass through the street  H    who  was consummate in the arts of a sycophant  began to court my favour  by  condoling my affliction  and assuring me  that the only method by which  I could regain my liberty was a cheerful compliance with the humour of  my lord  I was fully convinced of the truth of this observation  and   though my temper is altogether averse to dissimulation  attempted to  affect an air of serenity and resignation  But this disguise  I found   would not answer my purpose  and therefore I had recourse to the  assistance of my maid  who was permitted to attend me in my confinement   With her I frequently consulted about the means of accomplishing my  escape  In consequence of our deliberations  she directed a coach and  six to be ready at a certain part of the town  and to wait for me three  days in the same place  in case I could not come before the expiration  of that term    This previous measure being taken according to my instructions  the  next necessary step was to elude the vigilance of my guard  and in this  manner did I effectuate my purpose  Being by this time indulged in the  liberty of going out in the coach for the benefit of the air  attended  by two footmen  who had orders to watch all my motions  I made use  of this privilege one forenoon  when Lord    expected some company to  dinner  and bade the coachman drive to the lodgings of a man who wrote  with his mouth  intending to give my spies the slip  on pretence of  seeing this curiosity  but they were too alert in their duty to be thus  outwitted  and followed me up stairs into the very apartment    Disappointed in this hope  I resolved another scheme  which was  attended with success  I bought some olives at an oil shop  and  telling  the servants I would proceed to St  James s gate  and take a turn in the  park  broke one of the bottles by the way  complained of the misfortune  when I was set down  and desired my coach might be cleaned before my  return  While my attendants were employed in this office  I tripped  across the Parade to the Horse Guards  and chanced to meet with an  acquaintance in the park  who said  he saw by my countenance that I was  upon some expedition  I owned his suspicion was just  but  as I had not  time to
