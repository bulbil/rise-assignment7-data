     As couriers were continually arriving from the army  there passed few   days without hearing some farther confirmation of their most sanguine   expectations  but at length the guard being again changed  they lost all   further intelligence  and were for several months without being able to   hear any thing of what passed  They doubted not  however  but as things   were in so good a disposition  every day brought them nearer to the   completion of their wishes  and it was this pleasing prospect which   addressed their misfortunes  and enabled them to sustain cheerfully   those hardships which  almost ever since the withdrawing of Edella s   bounty  they had laboured under   Mattakesa  in the beginning of her   amours with Mullern  had indeed made him some presents  which he shared   with his companions  but either the natural inconstancy of her temper   making her grow weary of this intrigue for the sake of another  or her   circumstances not allowing her to continue such Donations  she soon grew   sparing of them  and at length totally desisted her visits at   the prison       As  ever since the compassionate Edella had procured them to be   removed from the dungeon  they had enjoyed the privilege of walking on   the leads  and going up to the round tower  which being of a very great   height  not only overlooked the town  but the country round for a   considerable distance  they frequently made use of this indulgence  at   first for no other purpose than to have the benefit of the open air  but   now in hope of seeing their beloved prince at the head of a victorious   army approaching to give them liberty and relief   But  alas  how   terrible a reverse of their high raised expectations had inconstant   fortune in store for them   One day as they were sitting together    discoursing on the usual topics with which they entertained each other    and endeavoured to beguile the tedious time  they heard a confused noise   as of some sudden tumult   Tho  they had now been above a year in   Russia  none of them could speak the language well enough to be   understood  so could receive no information from the guard  even should   they have proved good natured enough to be willing to satisfy their   curiosity  so they all run hastily up to the round tower  whence they   easily perceived the town in great confusion  and the people running in   such crowds  that in the hurry many were trampled to death in   endeavouring to pass the gates   at a distance they perceived standards   waving in the air  but could not yet distinguish what arms they bore   A   certain shivering and palpitation  the natural consequence of suspence    ran thro  all their nerves  divided as they were at this sight  between   hope and fear  but when it drew more near   when  instead of Swedish   colours they beheld those of Russia   when  in the place where they   expected to see their gallant king coming to restore them once more to   freedom  they saw the implacable czar enter in triumph  followed by   those heroes  the least of whom had lately made him tremble  now in   chains  and exposed to the ribald mirth and derision of the gaping   crowd  they lost at once their fortitude  and even all sense of   expressing their grief at this misfortune   the shock of it was so   violent  it even took away the power of feeling it  and they remained   for some moments rather like statues carv d out by mortal art  than real   men created by God  and animated with living souls  A general groan was   the first mark they gave of any sensibility of this dreadful stroke of   fate  but when recruited spirits once more gave utterance to words  how   terrible were their exclamations  Some of them  in the extravagance of   despair  said things relating to fate and destiny  which  on a less   occasion  could have little merited forgiveness       Unable either to remove from the place  or view distinctly what their   eyes were fixed upon  they stayed till the whole cavalcade was passed    then went down and threw themselves upon the floor  where their ears   were deafen d by the noise of guns  loud huzza s  and other testimonies   of popular rejoicings  both within and without the prison walls   What   have we now to expect  cried one   endless slavery   chains  infamy    lasting as our lives  replied another  Then let us dye  added a third    Right  said his companion feircely   the glory of Sweden is lost   Let   us disappoint these barbarians  these Russian monsters
