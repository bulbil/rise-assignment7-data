the agitations of his mind might disorder his brain  My lord told him he was too desponding  and said  he hoped all might be yet retrieved  He then enquired into the particular situation of his affairs  which are  I am grieved to say it  very bad indeed  We were told  when we were in Kent  that a part of South Park was mortgaged  but did not believe it  as we knew it was settled on you  Upon being asked  Mr Arnold himself acknowleged it  confessing at the same time  that he had been prevailed on to do this  in order to deliver Mrs Gerrarde’s brother out of gaol  and that it was the other villainous brother who had transacted the affair for him  I find  besides this mortgage  that  with the costs of his suit  he owes near seven thousand pounds  to answer which  he says  he is not worth six pence  his plate and the furniture of his houses in town and country excepted   Though I had shed many tears  whilst Lady V—— was describing Mr Arnold’s behaviour at the beginning of her discourse  I heard this latter part of her account with a composed attention   Lady V—— took me by the hand  I am sorry  dear Mrs Arnold  said she  that I am obliged to repeat such uncomfortable tidings to you  but you must know all  soon or late  and it as well now as hereafter  I am sure your patient temper and good sense will enable you to bear up against misfortunes   My lord then proceeded to ask Mr Arnold  if his friends could make his circumstances a little easier  and Mrs Arnold would consent to live with him again  had he any objection to it   My lord  answered your husband  from the moment I heard of Mrs    Gerrarde’s elopement  I flattered myself with the hopes of being restored to my senses  and my peace  by a reunion with my wife  for I own to you  her innocence from that very time became evident to me  and it was mere shame that prevented me from making my application to lady Bidulph  for the purpose of a reconciliation  The receipt of Mrs Gerrarde’s letter— whether the wretch has really felt compunction or whether her cruelty to me  in order to make me more unhappy  has drawn it from her I know not  the receipt of that letter  I say  wherein Mrs Arnold’s innocence is so entirely cleared  convinced me  I ought not to delay making my wife all the reparation in my power  Though I was shocked to think how much I had foolishly squandered away  I was still in possession of an estate of nine hundred pounds a year  for though it was then in litigation  my lawyers amused me to the last  with a belief that I should carry my suit  and notwithstanding that the payment of my debts would lessen it  I knew  with one of her contented and gentle spirit  it would be sufficient to make us happy  and her jointure  which I hoped soon to clear  added to it  would enable us to sit down in the country in tolerable affluence  and I had come to a resolution to make it the study of my life to render Mrs Arnold happy  I know she is an admirable œconomist  I resolved to imitate her  and hoped in time to retrieve our circumstances  These were my sentiments  my lord  when I wrote to you  to beg that you and my lady would come to town  I own I had not courage enough to make any efforts towards the so much wished for reunion  without the interposition of friends  whose good hearts I knew would rejoice  could their endeavours bring it about  and whose influence over Mrs Arnold I was certain would make the accomplishment easy  Do me the justice  my lord  to believe  that if I had not thought it in my power  to have made Mrs Arnold amends for the injuries I have done her  this hand should have been sooner employed to send a bullet thro’ my head  than to have endeavoured to procure your mediation in this affair   But as things have turned out  I would not for this earthly globe involve her in my ruin  nor shall her family have it to say  I sought their friendship when I was abandoned of every other hope   As to that point  answered my lord  I can bear you witness  that your first overture to me  in order to bring about a reconciliation  arrived before there was any likelihood of your standing in need of assistance  either from your wife’s friends or your own  for I believe they all  as well as yourself  were pretty sure of your carrying your    suit  which  if you had done  your affairs might  with a little care  have soon been  in a great measure  retrieved  Therefore  if they should attempt to make the ungenerous charge you apprehend  I can confute it  and will to all the world  and for the rest  we must manage as well as we can   My lord then proposed some methods to make his affairs a little more easy
