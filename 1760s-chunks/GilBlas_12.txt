Thus Thackeray upsets even his own ends  anxious  by the confessed clarion toned morality of his appeal  to produce the effect aimed at by a prophet in Israel  he nevertheless inspires in his reader a quick and sane recoil before the arbitrary injustice  or  at all events  the incredibility of the author s misanthropy  In literary art  in fact  the only way to convey the illusion of reality is to tell the average truth about the average man   Lesage  like the Tolstoi of the good period  had the tact and good sense to perceive this  He does not make the unscientific and inartistic blunder of humiliating his heroes  Like a Balzac or a Tolstoi or a Henry James  he gives them their full value  takes them for all they are worth  The pretension that naturalism  because superficially true to a certain aspect of life  is realism in the complete sense of the word  is a view which Lesage in Gil Blas triumphantly repudiates  and he differs from many playwrights of contemporary France  who appear to be so enamoured of caddishness as to regard its manifestations as pre  eminently worthy of presentation in the novel or on the stage  One of the ablest of Lesage s commentators has called him the Homer of naturalism  no neater phrase could be found to define his importance and his manner   Nor is it the fault of Lesage if his immediate influence upon the literature of his time was perhaps not wholly what he would himself have wished it to be  It is a commonplace to note that Lesage helped to prepare in France that eighteenth century with which he was in so many respects out of sympathy  There was a whole side of Lesage that was out of touch with the modern world surrounding him  M  Faguet seems to me absolutely right as to this point  The spirit  the attitude of Lesage are seventeenth  century    for  after all  the seventeenth century was realist while so eminently moralist  he believes in the superiority of the clear old form of expression  he abominates an affected style  he prefers natural utterance that everybody can understand to individual experiments in ingenious phraseology  Moreover  while not at all the conscious moralist  he is a moralist all the same  he has a certain generalising habit  the liking for large vistas  harmonious inclusive ranges of thought  his thought  scapes have the perfection and the proportions of a garden by Le Nôtre  But it is nevertheless certain that the immense success of Lesage as a realist  the fact that he made realism look so easy  constituted a terrible incentive to imitation  and that  as a matter of fact  his example was just one of those which no writer could afford to follow who had not his marvellous good sense and his mental and moral poise  Without such moral balance and such good sense the would be realist is almost certain to become addicted to the grosser forms of naturalism  to exercise  that is  his faculty of clear vision on special salient and picturesque  even salacious and perverse cases  rather than upon the types of the average world with which average men are familiar  Thus there can be no doubt that Lesage s unconcern for positive edification  his indifference to matters of conscience  was a trait of the eighteenth century  and a trait for which he may to a certain extent be held responsible  It was inevitable that he should find imitators  and that  in this sense  he may be said to open the way to a Crébillon fils and a Laclos  even to a Louvet  for whom he would have refused to be responsible  and to prepare an eighteenth century with which there is every reason to suppose he would have become utterly out of sympathy  not merely as a man  but as an artist in letters     IV  It remains to consider Gil Blas as a work of literary art  In style it is one of the most perfect examples of narrative prose in the world  comparable for limpidity  ease  and precision  with that of Cervantes in Don Quixote  With regard to its composition  it is noticeable that the novel begins at the same pitch of calm lucidity which is to characterise it to the end  The reader feels that the promise of the author in his  Declaration    I have merely undertaken to represent life as it is   is likely to be kept  Lesage speaks with authority  The artists who inspire confidence with their very first stroke are not numerous  They belong to the aristocracy of the masters  What do such certainty and distinction imply  They mean that the product is the fruit of a mature intelligence  that the artist  be he sculptor  writer  or painter  has not undertaken to express until his mind is  as we say  thoroughly made up as to the nature of its content  nor until he is serenely master of the means at his disposal  that  in a word  he knows his business  In the case of Lesage it is peculiarly significant that  when he published the first part of Gil Blas in 1715  he was already forty seven years of age  that the second part did not appear until 1724  nine years later  and that he was already
