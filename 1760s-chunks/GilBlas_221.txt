Lewis had neither father nor mother  and was already in possession of his fortune  you are to know that there is no danger of disagreeable consequences attaching to any but girls in a servile condition of life  or those unfortunate loose fish who are game for every sportsman  Ladies of our profession are privileged persons  we let off our charms like a rocket  and are not answerable for the damage where they fall  so much the worse for those families whose heirs we set in a blaze   As for Alcacer and myself  we were so strongly attached to one another  that I verily believe  love never yet did such execution as when he took aim at us two  Our passion was of such a violent nature  that we seemed to be under the influence of some spell  Those who knew how well we were together  thought us the happiest pair in the world  but we  who knew best  found ourselves the most miserable  Though Don Lewis had as fine an outside as ever fell to the lot of man  he was at the same time so jealous  that there was no living for vexation at his unfounded surmises  It was of no use  knowing his weakness and humouring it  to lay an embargo on my looks  if ever a male creature peeped into harbour  his suspicious temper  seldom at a loss for some crime to impute  rendered my armed neutrality of no avail  Our most tender moments had always a spice of wrangling  There was no standing the brunt of it  patience could hold out no longer on either side  and we quarrelled more peaceably than we had loved  Could you believe that the last day of our being together was the happiest  both equally wearied out by the perpetual recurrence of unpleasant circumstances  we gave a loose to our transports when we embraced for the last time  We were like two wretched captives  breathing the fresh air of liberty after all the horrors of our prison  house   Since that adventure  I have worn a breastplate against the little archer  No more amorous nonsense for me  at least to a troublesome excess  It is quite out of our line  to sigh and complain like Arcadian shepherdesses  Those should never give way to a passion in private  who hold it up to ridicule before the public   While these events were passing in my domestic establishment  Fame had not hung her trumpet breathless on the willows  she spread it about universally that I was an inimitable actress  That celestial tattler  though bankrupt times out of number  still contrives to revive her credit  the comedians of Grenada therefore wrote to offer me an engagement in their company  and by way of evidence that the proposal was not to be scorned  they sent me a statement of their daily receipts and disbursements  with their terms  which seemed to be advantageous  That being the case  I closed  though grieved in my heart to part with Phenicia and Dorothea  whom I loved as well as woman is capable of loving woman  I left the first laudably employed in melting the plate of a little haggling goldsmith  whose vanity so far got the better of his avarice that he must needs have a theatrical heroine for his mistress  I forgot to tell you that on my translation to the stage  from mere whim  I changed the name of Laura to that of Estella  and it was under the latter name that I took this engagement at Grenada   My first appearance was no less successful here than at Seville  and I soon felt myself wafted along by the sighs of my admirers  But resolving not to favour any except on honourable terms  I kept a guard of modesty in my intercourse with them  which threw dust in their eyes  Nevertheless  not to be the dupe of virtues which pay very indifferently  and were not exactly at home in their new mansion  I was balancing whether or not to take up with a young fellow of mean extraction  who had a place under government  and assumed the style of a gentleman in virtue of his office  with a good table and handsome equipage  when I saw the Marquis de Marialva for the first time  This Portuguese nobleman  travelling over Spain from mere curiosity  stopped at Grenada as he passed through it  He came to the play  I did not perform that evening  His examination of the actresses was very particular  and he found one to his liking  Their acquaintance commenced on the very next day  and the definitive treaty was very nearly concluded when I appeared upon the stage  What with some personal graces  and no little affectation in setting them off  the weather cock veered about all on a sudden  my Portuguese was mine and mine only till death do us part  Yet  since the truth must be told  I knew perfectly that my sister of the sock and buskin had entrapped this nobleman  and spared no pains to chouse her out of her prize  to my success you are yourself a witness  She bears me no small grudge on that account  but the thing could not be avoided  She ought to reflect that it is the way of all female flesh  that the dearest friends play off the same trick upon
