 for which reason  when the tutor was  quelled  the victor faced about  snatched the weapon out of his hand   and having broken it to pieces  remounted his horse and rode off   without deigning to honour him with any other notice   The condition in which they returned produced infinite clamour against  the conqueror  who was represented as a ruffian who had lain in ambush  to make away with his brother  in whose defence the curate was said to  have received those cruel stripes that hindered him from appearing for  three whole weeks in the performance of his duty at church  Complaints  were made to the commodore  who  having inquired into the circumstances  of the affair  approved of what his nephew had done  adding  with many  oaths  that provided Peregrine had been out of the scrape  he wished  Crook back had broken his neck in the fall   CHAPTER XXIX   He projects a plan of Revenge  which is executed against the Curate   Our hero  exasperated at the villainy of the curate  in the treacherous  misrepresentation he had made of this encounter  determined to rise upon  him a method of revenge  which should be not only effectual but also  unattended any bad consequence to himself  For this purpose he and  Hatchway  to whom he imparted his plan  went to the ale house one  evening  and called for an empty room  knowing there was no other but  that which they had chosen for the scene of action  This apartment was  a sort of a parlour that fronted the kitchen  with a window towards the  yard  where after they had sat some time  the lieutenant found means to  amuse the landlord in discourse  while Peregrine  stepping out into  the yard  by the talent of mimickry  which he possessed in a surprising  degree  counterfeited a dialogue between the curate and Tunley s  wife  This reaching the ears of the publican  for whose hearing it was  calculated  inflamed his naturally jealous disposition to such a degree   that he could not conceal his emotion  but made a hundred efforts  to quit the room  while the lieutenant  smoking his pipe with great  gravity  as if he neither heard what passed nor took notice of the    6 22 15  3 45 PM   landlord s disorder  detained him on the spot by a succession of  questions  which he could not refuse to answer  though he stood sweating  with agony all the time  stretching his neck every instant towards the  window through which the voices were conveyed  scratching his head  and  exhibiting sundry other symptoms of impatience and agitation  At length  the supposed conversation came to such a pitch of amorous complaisance   that the husband  quite frantic with his imaginary disgrace  rushed  out of the door crying   Coming  sir   but as he was obliged to make a  circuit round one half of the house  Peregrine had got in by the window  before Tunley arrived in the yard   According to the feigned intelligence he had received  he ran directly  to the barn  in expectation of making some very extraordinary discovery   and having employed some minutes in rummaging the straw to no purpose   returned in a state of distraction to the kitchen  just as his wife  chanced to enter at the other door  The circumstance of her appearance  confirmed him in the opinion that the deed was done  As the disease of  being henpecked was epidemic in the parish  he durst not express the  least hint of his uneasiness to her  but resolved to take vengeance on  the libidinous priest  who he imagined had corrupted the chastity of his  spouse   The two confederates  in order to be certified that their scheme had  taken effect  as well as to blow up the flame which they had kindled   called for Tunley  in whose countenance they could easily discern his  confusion  Peregrine  desiring him to sit down and drink a glass with  them  began to interrogate him about his family  and  among other  things  asked him how long he had been married to that handsome wife   This question  which was put with an arch significance of look  alarmed  the publican  who began to fear that Pickle had overheard his dishonour   and this suspicion was not at all removed when the lieutenant  with a  sly regard  pronounced  Tunley warn t you noosed by the curate    Yes   is was   replied the landlord  with an eagerness and perplexity of  tone  as if he thought the lieutenant knew that thereby hang a tale  and  Hatchway supported the suspicion by  Nay  as for that matter  the curate  may be a very sufficient man in his way   This transition from his wife  to the curate convinced him that his shame was known to his guests  and   in the transport of his indignation  he pronounced with great emphasis    A sufficient man  Odds heart  I believe they are all wolves in sheep s  clothing  I wish
