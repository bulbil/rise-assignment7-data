own reason ought to inform you         that being brought to me by compulsion will deserve other sort of        treatment than such as you might hope to find on returning of your        own accord to your much affronted husband            G  MUNDEN        This letter very much alarmed both the sister and the brother  the   former trembled at the thoughts of seeing herself in the hands of the   officers of justice  and the latter could not but be uneasy that a   disturbance of this kind should happen in his house  They were just   going to send for Mr  Markland  to consult him on what was to be done    when that gentleman  whom chance had brought that way  luckily came in    He found Mr  Thoughtless in great discomposure  and Mrs  Munden almost   drowned in tears  On being informed of the occasion   I see no reason     said he gravely   for all this  I cannot think that Mr  Munden will put   in execution what he threatens  at last  not till after I have spoke to   him again  I rather think he writes in this manner only to terrify you    Madam  into a submission to his will  However   continued he  after a   pretty long pause   to be secure from all danger of an affront this way    I think it would be highly proper you should retire to some place where   he may not know to find you  till I have once more tried how far he may   be prevailed upon to do you justice        This advice being highly approved of   My wife s sister   resumed he     has a very pleasant and commodious house on the bank of the river on   the Surrey side  she takes lodgers sometimes  but at present is without    so that  if you resolve to be concealed  you cannot find a more   convenient retreat  especially as  it s being so near London  nothing of   moment can happen here but what you may be apprized of in little more   than an hour        Mrs  Munden testifying as much satisfaction at this proposal as a person   in her circumstances could be capable of feeling  Mr  Markland told her   that he was ready to conduct her immediately to the place he mentioned    and her brother adding that he would accompany them  and see his sister   safe to her new abode  they all set out together on their little voyage    Mrs  Munden having first given directions to her servants where they   should follow her with such things as she thought would be wanted during   her stay there       On their arrival  they found Mr  Markland had spoken very modestly of   the place he recommended  the house was pleasant almost beyond   description  and rendered much more so by the obliging behaviour of its   owner       They all dined together that day  and  on parting  it was agreed that   Mrs  Munden should send her man every morning to town  in order to bring   her intelligence of whatever accidents had happened in relation to her   affairs on the preceding day       As much as this lady had been rejoiced at the kind reception she had met   with from her brother under her misfortunes  she was now equally pleased   at being removed for a time from him  not only because she thought   herself secure from any insults that might be offered by her husband    but also because this private recess seemed a certain defence against   the sight of Mr  Trueworth  a thing she knew not well how to have   avoided in town  without breaking off her acquaintance with Lady Loveit       After the gentlemen were gone  the sister in law of Mr  Markland led her   fair guest into the garden  which before she had only a cursory view of    She shewed her  among many other things  several curious exotick plants    which  she told her  she had procured from the nurseries of some persons   of condition to whom she had the honour to be known  but Mrs  Munden   being no great connoisseur that way  did not take much notice of what   she said concerning them  till  coming to the lower end  she perceived a   little wicker gate   To where does this lead   cried she   I will shew   you presently  Madam   replied the other  and  pulling it open  they   both entered into a grass walk  hemmed in on each side with trees  which   seemed as old as the creation
