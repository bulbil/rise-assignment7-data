 pretty innocent and artless  as Mrs  Jervis calls you  said   he  and is it thus you taunt and retort upon me  insolent as you are    But still I will be answered directly to my question  Why then  sir    said I  I will not tell a lie for the world  I did tell Mrs  Jervis  for   my heart was almost broken  but I opened not my mouth to any other  Very   well  boldface  said he  and equivocator again  You did not open your   mouth to any other  but did not you write to some other  Why  now  and   please your honour  said I   for I was quite courageous just then   you   could not have asked me this question  if you had not taken from me   my letter to my father and mother  in which I own I had broken my mind   freely to them  and asked their advice  and poured forth my griefs       And so I am to be exposed  am I  said he  in my own house  and out of   my house  to the whole world  by such a sauce box as you  No  good sir    said I  and I hope your honour won t be angry with me  it is not I   that expose you  if I say nothing but the truth  So  taunting again    Assurance as you are  said he  I will not be thus talked to       Pray  sir  said I  of whom can a poor girl take advice  if it must not   be of her father and mother  and such a good woman as Mrs  Jervis  who    for her sex sake  should give it me when asked  Insolence  said he  and   stamped with his foot  am I to be questioned thus by such a one as you    I fell down on my knees  and said  For Heaven s sake  your honour  pity   a poor creature  that knows nothing of her duty  but how to cherish her   virtue and good name  I have nothing else to trust to  and  though poor   and friendless here  yet I have always been taught to value honesty   above my life  Here s ado with your honesty  said he  foolish girl  Is   it not one part of honesty to be dutiful and grateful to your master  do   you think  Indeed  sir  said I  it is impossible I should be ungrateful   to your honour  or disobedient  or deserve the names of bold face or   insolent  which you call me  but when your commands are contrary to that   first duty which shall ever be the principle of my life       He seemed to be moved  and rose up  and walked into the great chamber   two or three turns  leaving me on my knees  and I threw my apron over my   face  and laid my head on a chair  and cried as if my heart would break    having no power to stir       At last he came in again  but  alas  with mischief in his heart  and   raising me up  he said  Rise  Pamela  rise  you are your own enemy  Your   perverse folly will be your ruin  I tell you this  that I am very   much displeased with the freedoms you have taken with my name to my   housekeeper  as also to your father and mother  and you may as well have   real cause to take these freedoms with me  as to make my name suffer for   imaginary ones  And saying so  he offered to take me on his knee  with   some force  O how I was terrified  I said  like as I had read in a book   a night or two before  Angels and saints  and all the host of heaven    defend me  And may I never survive one moment that fatal one in which I   shall forfeit my innocence  Pretty fool  said he  how will you forfeit   your innocence  if you are obliged to yield to a force you cannot   withstand  Be easy  said he  for let the worst happen that can  you   will have the merit  and I the blame  and it will be a good subject for   letters to your father and mother  and a tale into the bargain for Mrs    Jervis       He by force kissed my neck and lips  and said  Whoever blamed Lucretia    All the shame lay on the ravisher only and I am content to take all the   blame upon me  as I have already borne too great a share for what I have   not deserved
