his friend  and returned to town this morning  he only looked into my room  to ask me how I did  my mother was sitting with me  I believe that hindered him from coming in  for he looked as if he wanted to speak to me  He bowed to my mother  but said not a word  he went abroad again as soon as he was dressed  and did not come in till late  I fear his conduct will oblige us to separate  for my mother will not brook any liberties to be taken with her  she hinted as much  and said she believed Sir George was tired of living regularly   She anticipated the request I intended to make to her  of letting me go out of town  for she said  as soon as I was able  I should remove into the country for a while  Sidney Castle is too long a journey for me at present to think of undertaking  and she talks of going into Essex  on a visit to Lady Grimston  which we have long promised her  I shall like this better than going down to Wiltshire  where the want of my Cecilia would make my old abode a melancholy place  especially at this juncture   August 4  Sir George continues sullen and cold to us  he never has had an opportunity of saying any thing particular to me since the day he said so much  My mother scarce ever leaves me  he seems nettled at this  I believe he would endeavour to work on me  as he knows the attempt    would be vain in regard to her  As I am now well enough to receive the visits of our intimate acquaintance  I am never without company  I am really in pretty good spirits  and bear my disappointment  as I told you I would  very handsomely  I never hear Mr Faulkland’s name mentioned  no more than if such a man did not exist  We are to set out for lady Grimston’s house on Tuesday  it is but twenty miles from London  and I am already strong enough to bear a longer journey   My mother told Sir George  that if he liked it  the house we are now in was at his service during her time of it  of which there are some months to come  for she said  she meant to go directly home from Essex  Sir George thanked her  but did not say whether he would accept of her offer or not   August 5  I have been obliged to turn away my poor Ellen  She was so imprudent as to receive a letter for me from Mr Faulkland’s man  contrary to my mother’s express commands  She brought it to me  and I gave it to my mother unopened  who put it directly into the fire without reading it  and told me it would oblige her  if I would part with the servant who had presumed to take it after her prohibition  I instantly obeyed  and have just discharged her  I should have a sad loss of her  only I am in hopes of having her place well supplied by an old acquaintance and play fellow of ours  poor Patty Main  her father is dead  and she is obliged to go to service  for he has left a widow with six children  The eldest son  you remember  served his time to his father  and is just now setting out in business  but a young surgeon in a country town must take some time to establish himself  though he is a very worthy youth  and I hear clever in his profession   Patty came to town last week with a lady from our neighbourhood  who applied to my mother to recommend the girl to wait on some person of fashion  My mother has been looking out for a suitable place for her  but she told me today  she thought I could not do better than take her to myself  I shall be very glad to have her  for she is an amiable young woman   August 6  We go out of town at seven o’clock to morrow morning  as we are to dine at Grimston hall  and purpose going at our leisure  I will steal a few minutes from sleep  though it is now very late  to give you a short    scene which passed in my chamber about an hour ago   Sir George  who  according to his late custom  had been abroad all day  came into my room  where my mother and I were sitting together  He asked us  Did we hold our purpose of going out of town next day  Yes  certainly  my mother said  And you intend going from lady Grimston’s to Sidney Castle  We do  Then  madam  to my mother   as it is the last trouble you are likely to have from Mr Faulkland  I hope you will not refuse to read this letter  which he has sent you  and he took one out of his pocket  and presented it to her  She did not make an offer to receive it  but answered  Sir George  it is to no purpose for Mr Faulkland to sollicit me  you know I don’t easily alter my resolutions when once they are fixed
