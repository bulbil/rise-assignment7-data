t remember any instance of the like freedom used to Lady Clementina   My lovely Love  said he  to express myself in your uncle s stile  which is that of my heart  tell me  Can you have pity for a poor man  when he is miserable  who  on a certain occasion  shewed you none  See what a Letter Sir Hargrave Pollexfen has written to Dr  Bartlett  who asks my advice about attending him   I obtained leave to communicate it to you  my dear Ladies  Be pleased to return it to me  I presume  you will read it here   Dear Dr  Bartlett   CAN your company be dispensed with by the best of men  for one  two  three days —I have not had a happy hour since I saw you and Sir Charles Grandison at my house on the Forest  All is gloom and horror in my mind  My despondency is  must be  of the blackest kind  It is blacker than remorse  It is all repining  but no repentance  I cannot  cannot  repent  Lord God of Heaven and Earth  what a   209 wretch am I  with such a fortune  such estates  I am rich as Craesus  yet more miserable than the wretch that begs his bread from door to door  and who oftener meets repulses  than relief  What a glorious choice has your patron made  Youth unbroken  conscience his friend  he cannot know an enemy  O that I had lived the life of your patron  I cannot see a creature who does not extol him  My wine merchant s name is Danby—Good God  What stories does he tell of him  Lord Jesus  What a heart must he have  that would permit him to do such things as Danby reports of him  of his own knowlege  While I—As young a man as himself  for what I know—With power to do good  as great  perhaps greater  than his own —Lord  Lord  Lord  what a hand have I made of it  for the last three or four years of my life  who might have reached Threescore and ten with comfort  whereas now  at Twenty eight  I am on the very brink of the grave  It appears to me as ready dug  It yawns for me  I am neither fit to die  nor to live  My days are dreadful  My nights are worse  My bed is a bed of nettles  and not of down  Not one comfortable thought  not one good action  to revolve  in which I had not some vile gratification to promote  Wretched man  It is come home to me  with a vengeance   You prayed by me  You prayed for me  I have not been so happy since—Come  and make me easy—happy I can never be  in this world—For pity  for charity sake  come and teach me how to bear life  or how to prepare for its cessation  And if Sir Charles Grandison would make me one more visit  would personally join in prayer with you and me  a glimpse of comfort would once more dart in upon my mind   Try your interest with him  my dear Sir  in my behalf  and come together  Where is he —The great God of Heaven and Earth prosper to him all his wishes  be he where he will  and be they what they   210 will  Every body will find their account in his prosperity  But I  what use have I made of the prosperity given me —Merceda gone to his account  Bagenhall undone  Jordan shunning me  Narrow soul d Jordan  He is reformed  but not able to divide the man from the crime  he thinks he cannot be in earnest  but by hating both  God help me  I cannot  now  if I would  give him a bad example  He need not be afraid of my staggering him in his good purposes   One favour  for God s sake  procure for me—It s  that the man whose life once I sought  and thought myself justified by the provocation  who afterwards saved mine  for a time saved it  reserved as I was for pains  for sufferings  in mind and body  worse than death—That this man will be the Executor of my last Will  I have not a friend left  My relations are hungering and watching for my death  as birds of prey over a field of battle  My next heirs are my worst enemies  and most hated by me  Dear Sir Charles Grandison  my deliverer  my preserver  from those bloody Frenchmen  if you are the good man I think you  complete your kindness to him whom you have preserved  and say  you will be his Executor  I will  because I must  do justice to the pretensions of those who will rejoice over my remains  and I will leave you a discretionary power  in articles wherein you may think I have shewn hatred  For justice sake  then  be my Executor  And do you  good Bartlett  put me in the way of repentance  and I shall then be happy  Draw me up  dear Sir  a Prayer  that shall
