some   time  a happy thought procured me my liberty  I wrote a most   penitential letter to the Pope s nuncio  in which I discovered my   true name  and my having fled from my vows  and pretending a   thorough sense of my guilt  and desire of returning to my order    begged his intercession in my favour  My scheme succeeded    He claimed me as an ecclesiastic  and the king  whose mind was too   intent on greater matters to think of me  readily complied  I was   accordingly released from my prison  but instead of being set   absolutely at liberty  as I had hoped  was sent under a guard of   ecclesiastics to Rome  where all the favour I could obtain was to be   ordered back to my convent  This was a great disappointment   to me   but I was obliged to submit  I accordingly set out  guarded   as before  but determined to take the first opportunity of making   my escape  which I at length effected  after many vain attempts        To frustrate the pursuits of my guards  I fled into Switzerland    where the name of liberty flattered my hopes of doing whatever I   pleased  The first thing I did there  was to abjure my religion   and profess theirs  to conciliate their good opinion  This was no   difficulty upon me  as I had long looked upon all religions with   equal indifference  As I had no money  I immediately commenced         270 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     author  But  though I gained reputation  my profits were so   inconsiderable that I was obliged to have recourse to other methods   for my support  some of which  happening to contradict their pre    judices  I was obliged to leave their dominions with circumstances   of disgrace  You will laugh at the narrow notions of mankind    when I tell you that the affair they made so great a noise about   was only my denying a debt which I was unable to pay  and the   creditor did not even want        There were some other particulars  indeed  of my conduct    which would have met with a severe fate  had I not taken prudent   care to obviate it  I had entered into an intimacy with a person   of some fortune  who had an agreeable wife  The connections of   the wise are always made with a view to some particular end  I   had more than one in this acquaintance   the supply of my neces    sities  by the generosity of the husband  and the gratification of   my pleasure  by the enjoyment of the wife  I succeeded in both    but was prevented by an accident from enjoying my success long    The husband surprised us one day in a situation that did not admit   of doubt  He diew his sword  to have revenged his wrongs with   my death   but I disappointed his design by presenting a pistol at   his head  which I always carried about with me  for fear of accidents    Upon this  he ran out of the house in a kind of frenzy  I saw the   delicacy of my situation  and that my safety depended upon the   proper use of that moment  The wife had swooned away at the   first sight of her husband  I ran and fetched a glass of water  as   if to recover her  but conveyed a few drops into it  which I never   went without  for any such emergency  that delivered her for ever   from all fear of her husband s resentment  It was in her power to   make discoveries to her husband  which I did not choose   beside    as the suspicion of her death would inevitably fall upon him  I   thought that a good way to escape his revenge  I then quitted the   house without being perceived  All things happened as I could   wish  The husband was obUged to fly from his country  to avoid   an ignominious death for the murder of his wife  and all his effects   were confiscated to the state  It is true  I did not entirely escape   suspicion  He had laid open all he knew of the affair by letter to   his friends  but  though they believed him  he had no evidence to   support his charge  so that I despised his impotent accusations        Prom Switzerland I once more turned my face to Grermany    where my name was so famous for my political knowledge that   a war being just ready to break out  I received considerable offers   from most of the parties concerned to engage me in their service    But though I refused none  I resolved not to engage myself absolutely
