 I   sent her notice of my visit  and on entering the room He lives    then  she cried   my husband  my Harry lives   It is enough   I   shall die happy  I shall now depart in peace      Here I ordered myself to be laid by her side  when taking a   hand which she had feebly reached out  and pressing it to my lips   You would forsake me then  my Matty   You die  you say   and   you die happy  in leaving me the most wretched  the most desolate   of men  You die  my love you die   and I  who would have   fostered you and your babe with my vitals  it is I who has dug   a grave for the one and for the other  But you must not forsake   me  my Matty  I will not be forsaken by you   since we cannot   live asunder  let us die let us die together       Here a passionate silence ensued on either part   but my wounds   growing painful  and beginning to bleed afresh  I was obliged to be   carried back to my own apartment      Within a few days more I was so well recovered as to be able to   walk about   from which time I was a constant attendant on my   beloved  and became her most tender and assiduous nursekeeper      You must have heard  my cousin  that the customs and manners   of those times were altogether the reverse of what they are at   present  Hypocrisy is no longer a fault among men  all now is   avowed libertinism and open profaneness  and children scoff at   the name and profession of that religion which their fathers   revered  On the contrary  in those days all men were either real   or pretended zealots   every mechanic professed  like Aaron  to   carry a Urim and Thummim about him   and no man would   engage in any business or bargain  though with an intent to over    reach his neighbour  without going apart  as he said  to consult the   Lord      My Matty  at the same time  was the humblest of all saints  with    out any parade of sanctification  Hers was a religion  of whose   value she had the daily and hourly experience   it was indeed a   religion of power  It held her  as on a rock  in the midst of a   turbulent and fluctuating world   it gave her a peace of spirit that   smiled at provocation   it gave her comfort in affliction  patience in   anguish  exaltation in humiliation  and triumph in death      In about five weeks after her unhappy miscarriage  she appeared         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  203     on the recovery  though by very slow degrees  and  with assist    ance  at times sat up in her bed   when her oldest physician one   morning called me apart I am loth  sir  said he  very loth to   acquaint you with my apprehensions  I wish I may be mistaken     but I fear greatly for you I fear that your dear lady cannot re    cover  By the symptoms  I conjecture that an abscess  or im    posthume  is forming within her   but a few days will ascertain   matters either for us or against us      Had all sorts of evil tidings come crowding one upon another  I   should not have been affected as I then was affected  I could not   rise from my seat to bid the doctor adieu  My knees trembled   under me   a swimming came before my eyes   and a sudden sick    ness relaxed and reversed my whole frame  Alas   I had not at   that time the resource of my Matty   I had not on the armour with   which she was armed to all issues and events  I however raised   my thoughts to heaven  in a kind of helpless acquiescence rather   than confident resignation  I struggled not to appear weaker than   became my manhood   and I said to myself  doctors have often   been mistaken      Having recollected my strength and spirits the best I could  I   adventured to enter my wife s apartment  She was just raised in   her bed  from whence her pale and emaciated countenance looked   forth  as the sun  toward his setting  looks through a sickly atmo    sphere  in confidence of his arising in the fulness of morning glory      Having cautiously and dejectedly seated myself beside her  she   reached out both her hands  and  pressing
