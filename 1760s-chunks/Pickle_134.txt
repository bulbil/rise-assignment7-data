scruple    So saying  he swallowed several mouthfuls of the questioned coney  and  Pallet seemed to eye it again with inclination  nay  he even resumed his  knife and fork  and being just on the point of applying them  was seized  with another qualm of apprehension  that broke out in an exclamation of    After all  Mr  Jolter  if it should be a real ram cat  Lord have mercy  upon me  here is one of the claws   With these words he presented the  tip of a toe  of which Pipes had snipped off five or six from a duck  that was roasted  and purposely scattered them in the fricassee  and  the governor could not behold this testimonial without symptoms of  uneasiness and remorse  so that he and the painter sat silenced and  abashed  and made faces at each other  while the physician  who hated  them both  exulted over their affliction  bidding them be of good cheer   and proceed with their meal  for he was ready to demonstrate  that  the flesh of a cat was as nourishing and delicious as veal or mutton   provided they could prove that the said cat was not of the boar kind   and had fed chiefly on vegetable diet  or even confined its carnivorous  appetite to rats and mice  which he affirmed to be dainties of exquisite  taste and flavour  He said  it was a vulgar mistake to think that  all flesh devouring creatures were unfit to be eaten  witness the  consumption of swine and ducks  animals that delight in carriage as  well as fish  and prey upon each other  and feed on bait and carrion   together with the demand for bear  of which the best hams in the world  are made  He then observed that the negroes on the coast of Guinea  who  are healthy and vigorous people  prefer cats and dogs to all other  fare  and mentioned from history several sieges  during which the  inhabitants  who were blocked up  lived upon these animals  and had  recourse even to human flesh  which  to his certain knowledge  was in  all respects preferable to pork  for  in the course of his studies  he  had  for the experiment s sake  eaten a steak cut from the buttock of a  person who had been hanged   This dissertation  far from composing  increased the disquiet in  the stomachs of the governor and painter  who  hearing the last  illustration  turned their eyes upon the orator  at the same instant   with looks of horror and disgust  and the one muttering the term   cannibal   and the other pronouncing the word  abomination   they rose  from table in a great hurry  and running towards another apartment     6 22 15  3 45 PM   jostled with such violence in the passage  that both were overturned  by the shock  which also contributed to the effect of their nausea that  mutually defiled them as they lay   CHAPTER XLIX   Nor is the Physician sacred from his Ridicule  They reach Arras  where  our Adventurer engages in Play with two French Officers  who  next  Morning  give the Landlord an interesting Proof of their Importance   The doctor remained sullen and dejected during the whole journey  not  but that he attempted to recover his importance by haranguing upon the  Roman highways  when Mr  Jolter desired the company to take notice of  the fine pavement upon which they travelled from Paris into Flanders   but Pallet  who thought he had now gained the ascendency over the  physician  exerted himself in maintaining the superiority he had  acquired  by venting various sarcasms upon his self conceit and  affectation of learning  and even tittering puns and conundrums upon the  remarks which the republican retailed  When he talked of the Flaminian  Way  the painter questioned if it was a better pavement than the  Fleminian Way on which they travelled  and the doctor having observed   that this road was made for the convenience of drawing the French  artillery into Flanders  which was often the seat of war  his competitor  in wit replied  with infinite vivacity   There are more great guns than  the French king knows of drawn along this causeway  doctor    Encouraged by the success of these efforts  which tickled the  imagination of Jolter  and drew smiles  as he imagined  of approbation  from our hero  he sported in many other equivoques of the same nature   and at dinner  told the physician  that he was like the root of the  tongue  as being cursedly down in the mouth   By this time  such was the animosity subsisting between these quondam  friends  that they never conversed together  except with a view  of exposing each other to the ridicule or contempt of their  fellow travellers  The doctor was at great pains to point out the folly  and ignorance of Pallet in private to Peregrine  who was often conjured  in the same manner by the painter  to take notice of the physician s  want
