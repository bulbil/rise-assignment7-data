 Horatio shall find me a sister in my good   offices   mademoiselle Charlotta will be here immediately   she has   counterfeited an indisposition to avoid going to vespers  and obtained   permission for me to stay with her   so that every thing is right  and   as soon as the choir is gone into chapel you will see her  It would be   needless to repeat the transports Horatio uttered on this occasion  so I   shall only say they were such as convinced mademoiselle du Pont  that   her fair friend had not made this condescension to a man ungrateful for    or insensible of the obligation  He was indeed so lost in them  that he   scarce remembered to pay those compliments to the lady for her generous   assistance which it merited from him  but she easily forgave any   unpoliteness he might be guilty of on that score  and he so well attoned   for it after he had given vent to the sudden emotions of his joy  that   she looked  upon him as the most accomplished  as well as the most   faithful of his sex  They had entered into some discourse of the rules   of the monastry  and how impossible it would have been for him to have   gained an interview with mademoiselle Charlotta  but by the means she   had contrived   she told him that young lady had seen him for several   days  and not doubling but it was for her sake he came  had resolved to   run any risque rather than he should depart without obtaining so small a   consolation as the sight of her was capable of affording  Horatio  by   the most passionate expressions  testified how dearly he prized what she   had seemed to think of so little value  when the expected charmer of his   soul drew near the grate   All that can be conceived of tender and   endearing past between them  but when he related to her the occasion of   his coming  and that change of life he now was entering upon  she   listened to him with a mixture of pleasure and anxiety   she rejoiced   with him on the great prospects he had in view  but the terror of the   dangers he was plunging in was all her own  She was far  however  from   discouraging him in his designs  and concealed not her admiration of the   greatness of his spirit  and that love of glory which seemed to render   him capable of undertaking any thing       But when she heard in what manner her father had treated him  she was   all astonishment  as she knew his temper perfectly well  she was certain   he would not have acted in the manner he did without being influenced to   it by a very strong liking for Horatio  for tho  gratitude for the good   office he had received at his hands might have engaged him to make some   requital  yet there were several expressions which Horatio  who   remembered all he said  with the utmost exactness repeated to her  that   convinced her he would not have made use of  if he had not meant the   person better than he at present would have him think he did  and that   there was in reality nothing restrained him from making them as happy as   their mutual affection could desire  but the pride of blood and the talk   of the world  which the disparity of their present circumstances would   occasion  As she doubted not but the courage and virtue of Horatio would   remove that impediment  by acquiring a promotion sufficient to   countenance his pretensions  she had now no other disquiet than what   arose from her fears for his safety  which she over and over repeated    conjuring him  in the most tender terms  not to hazard himself beyond   what the duties of his post obliged him to   this  said she  shall be   the test of my affection to you  for whenever I hear you run yourself   into unnecessary dangers  I will conclude from that moment you have   ceased to remember  or pay any regard to my injunctions or repose       Horatio kissed her hand thro  the grate  and told her  he would always   set too great a value on a life she was so good to with the continuance   of  not to take all the care of it that honour would admit  but she   would not give him leave to add any asseverations to this promise    which  said she  you will every day be tempted to break   the   enterprizing disposition of the prince you are going to serve  added to   your own sense of glory  will make it very difficult for you not to be   the foremost in following wherever his royal example leads the way   nor   would I wish you to purchase security by the price of infamy
