was only a bubble raised by the breath of malignity —They fondly wished to commence a process of Partus Suppositio  against Don Ferdinand  and to make enquiries for it  they sent privately to Paris Don Stivalbo  a lawyer  who lay under great obligations to the family of Arvidoso  and was prevailed  Page  30  with to undertake the ungracious task   Don Stivalbo was a man of principle  and he resolved to conduct himself with the utmost impartiality  but when he arrived at Paris  he was soon surrounded by French priests  advocates  and agents of all kinds  who wished no better than so fat a subject as the domains of Arvidoso and← Dorando → to feed upon  The gallant Stivalbo understanding little of their language  with true Spanish generosity  trusted to the reports of these gentry  who with many bows  shrugs  and compliments  pretended they had made astonishing discoveries  till Stivalbo had his imagination so warmed  that he himself gave credit to the imposture  and a suit was immediately raised before the senate of Sevile   Page  31  In the meantime the guardians of Don Ferdinand began to be somewhat apprehensive  knowing that it was not difficult to bring very extraordinary proofs from the Gavaccios  as the Spaniards call the French  whom they detest —The princess dowager was determined to be at the bottom of the affair  and set out herself for Paris  carrying with her several lawyers of great eminence in their profession  and remarkable for their honour as private gentlemen  She had the satisfaction to find  upon a careful enquiry  that the house of Arvidoso had been led a wild goosechace  and that there was nothing to fear   The Arvidoso party  however  still continued their pursuit  changing their ground  and taking up a variety of different plans  so that the princess  Page  32  was obliged to make no less than three or four journeys a cross the Pyrenees  in order to get every new story refuted  and indeed this was easy enough  for no sooner did the priests of Arvidoso conjure up a spectre  than the princess ← Dorando → found priests who as cleverly laid it  Such  however  was the ingenuity of the sharpset emissaries in France  that they contrived to keep the affair afloat for several years  while they were magnificently entertained by both parties  who  according to the Parisian phrase  avoient beaucoup d esprit  et donnoient bien à manger   While all this was transacting  it was thought proper to call Don Spiritoso before the senate of Sevile  to have him examined concerning the particulars of the delivery of the princess his spouse  He was then very  Page  33  old  and brought low with sickness  but the liveliness of his temper still continued  and he answered every question that was put to him with frankness and readiness  at the same time telling the judges  that he had all his life long had an irregular and imperfect memory  which was now grown still worse  and therefore it would not be fair should every advantage be taken of his inconsistencies against his son  whom he had always acknowledged  Not long after this examination  Don Spiritoso died  and with his dying breath confirmed the legitimacy of Don Ferdinand —Donna Justina also died  and stept into eternity declaring  that she had been present at the birth of the prince   During the dependance of this tedious process  Don Ferdinand behaved  Page  34  with a manly composure and decent gravity  which showed his good sense and proper feelings  He one day called aside one of his lawyers  and insisted with him to tell his real opinion of the cause    For  said he  whatever opulence I might gain by it  I should be sorry to contaminate the blood of a family which I revere  But I have another reason for insisting to know the event of the cause  I am yet a young man  and if you think I shall be proved an impostor  I would lose no time  but go immediately to the Indies  where my disgrace will not be known  and where I may pass my days with some reputation    —The lawyer was greatly moved by this speech of the prince  but assured him that he need be under no concern     The cause was at length ready for  Page  35  determination  volumes of proofs and memorials were laid before the judges  and a day was appointed for its decision in the senate of Sevile   Never was there a more interesting scene  The judgment hall was filled with a croud of spectators  mostly people of rank  who waited in the greatest anxiety and trepidation  to hear the fate of ← Dorando →   When the senators took their places  not a murmur was heard  all was fixed attention —The senators sat for some minutes in awful silence   The chief justice was a man of great knowledge in the laws of his country  of a clear head and a sound understanding  He was descended of a distinguished house in Andalusia  which had produced so many senators  that the office seemed to be hereditary in the family —He at last  Page  36  addressed his brethren—   It is not my custom  respected signors  to speak in
