 but also added many   circumstances of my own guilt which she had omitted  or perhaps   not known      So complicated guilt seemed to require consideration to find out   proper punishment  so I was remanded to my dungeon  but without   the least encouragement to hope  The next day I was again   brought into the court  where my former sentence was changed   into that of being broken alive upon the wheel   and this severity   was said to be in justice to Amelia      When I had stood some moments stupefied with fear  the judge   addressed me again in these words     Thou hast heard  wretched   man  the sentence due to thy crimes   but great as they have been    mercy extends her hand to thee  The virtues of the illustrious   Donna Amelia overbalance thy guilt  and have prevailed for a    mitigation of thy punishment  in gratitude to that Divine Providence   which made thee the cause of her coming among us  Thou shalfc   not die  because we would not kill thy soul before thou hast had   time to repent of thy crimes   nor shalt thou suffer torture  that   thy strength may not be impaired for the labour to which thy   Jife is doomed   for this is the last day thou shalt ever behold the     B         18 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     light of heaven  Thou shalt immediately descend into the mines   there to work out the residue of thine unhappy days in raising that   gold for the use of others  the insatiable desire of which was the   cause of all thy guilt        I would have spoken in the agony of my soul  to desire death    but I was stopped by the judge  who sternly said that to hear a   word from me would be an insult upon justice  On his saying which   I was hurried away to the mountains over us  and precipitated into   this gulf  where I have now been near     Just as he said this  I was obliged to fly away to my body  which   the unhappy Traffic had thrown from his hand into the vessel in   which it was to be raised from the mine      The length of this story will make you wonder when I tell you   that the spirit of Traffic showed it to me in a moment  for no longer   did the gold remain in his possession  and I am always obliged to   attend my body whenever it changes its master  But to understand   this you must be informed that we spirits do not distinguish our   existence by time or a succession of parts as men do   with us there   is nothing past or to come  but everything is present in one view   so far as the natural course of causes and effects is preserved free   from interruption by superior power          CHAPTER VII     CHRTSAL PITRSITES THE HISTOEY OF HIS ADVENTXTBES â€” HE BXPLAHTS   SOME DIPFIOULTIES IN HIS OWN NATURE â€” HE IS OFFERED AT A   CONFESSION TO A PRIEST â€” THE CONFESSION AND OBEBD OF A   NATIVE PERUVIAN â€” THE PENANCE ENJOINED HIM BT A JESTITT     There is no crime  however black in its own nature  that does not   receive an aggravation from hypocrisy   but the highest exertion   of this vice is when it makes a pretext of the best institutions to   promote the practice of the worst actions  Of this I have seen   innumerable instances in the adventures of my present state    though none so flagrant as what I shall now relate      You may imagine I felt pleasure at emerging from that infernal   abyss into light  There was nothing remarkable in the three or   four first stages I went through  my temporary owners being only   the refiners and other tradesmen  who purified me from mixtures   of mineral dross      I see you are desirous to know how I could preserve my identity   when melted down with large quantities of the same metal  But   you must know that   spirits have a power of expanding or con    tracting themselves into what dimensions they please   and that   their life is not confined to any particular parts  as the heart or   head  as in man  but is diffused through their whole bodies  so that   any part being sepnrated from the rest does not die       but that   portion of spirit which was in it at the time of such separation       Miltoc          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 19     serves as a life for it  and becomes a distinct spirit  to inform that
