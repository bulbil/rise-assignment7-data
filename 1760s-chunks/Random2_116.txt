of our souls  I obtained her consent to compleat my happiness as soon as my father should judge it proper  and applying with my own hands a valuable necklace  composed of diamonds and amethysts set alternately  which an old Spanish lady at Paraguay presented me with  I took my leave  promising to return in the afternoon with Don Rodriguez —When I went home  this generous parent enquired very affectionately about the health of my dear Narcissa  to whom that   350 I might be the more agreeable  he put into my hand a deed  by which I found myself in possession of fifteen thousand pounds  exclusive of the profits of my own merchandize  which amounted to three thousand more —After dinner I accompanied him to the lodging of my mistress  who being dressed for the occasion  made a most dazzling appearance  I could perceive him struck with her figure  which I really think was the most beautiful that ever was created under the sun  He embraced her tenderly  and told her  he was proud of having a son who had spirit to attempt  and qualifications to engage  the affections of such a fine lady —She blushed at this compliment  and with eyes full of the softest languishment turned upon me  said  she would have been unworthy of Mr  Random s attention  had she been blind to his extraordinary merit —I made no other answer than a low bow  My father sighing  pronounced     Such once was my Charlotte    while the tear rushed into his eye  and the tender heart of Narcissa manifested itself in two precious drops of sympathy  which  but for his presence  I would have kissed away  Without repeating the particulars of our conversation  I shall only observe  that Don Rodriguez was as much charmed with her good sense  as with her appearance  and she was no less pleased with his understanding and polite address —It was determined that he should write to the Squire signifying his approbation of my passion for his sister  and offering a settlement which he should have no reason to reject  and that  if he should refuse the proposal  we would crown our mutual wishes without any farther regard to his will       351  CHAP  LXVIII    My father makes a present to Narcissa—the letter is dispatched to her brother—I appear among my acquaintance—Banter s behaviour—the Squire refuses his consent—my uncle comes to town—approves of my choice—I am married—we meet the Squire and his lady at the play—our acquaintance is courted   AFTER having spent the evening to the satisfaction of all present  my father addressed himself thus to Narcissa     Madam  give me leave to consider you hereafter as my daughter  in which capacity I insist upon your accepting this first instance of my paternal duty and affection    With these words  he put into her hand a bank note for 500l  which she no sooner examined  than with a low curtesy she replied    Dear Sir  tho  I have not the least occasion for this supply  I have too great a veneration for you  to refuse this proof of your generosity and esteem  which I the more freely receive  because I already look upon Mr  Random s interest as inseparably connected with mine    He was extremely well pleased at her frank and ingenuous reply  upon which we saluted  and wished her good night —The letter  at my request  was dispatched to Sussex by an express  and in   352 the mean time  Don Rodriguez  to grace my nuptials  hired a ready furnished house  and set up a very handsom equi     Though I passed the greatest part of the day with the darling of my soul  I found leisure sometimes to be among my former acquaintance  who were astonished at the magnificence of my appearance  Banter in particular was confounded at the strange vicissitudes of my fortune  the causes of which he endeavoured in vain to discover  until I thought fit to disclose the whole secret of my last voyage  partly in consideration of our former intimacy  and partly to prevent unfavourable conjectures which he and others  in all probability  would have made in regard to my circumstances  He professed great satisfaction at this piece of news  and I had no cause to believe him insincere  when I considered that he would now look upon himself as acquitted of the debt he owed me  and at the same time flatter himself with hopes of borrowing more —I carried him home to dinner with me  and my father liked his conversation so much  that upon hearing his difficulties  he desired me to accommodate him for the present  and enquire if he would accept of a commission in the army  towards the purchase of which he would willingly lend him money  Accordingly  I gave my friend an opportunity of being alone with me  when  as I expected  he told me that he was just on the point of being reconciled to an old rich uncle  whose heir he was  but wanted a few pieces for immediate expence  which he desired I would lend him  and take his bond for the whole  His demand was limited to ten guineas  and   353 when I put twenty into his hand  he stared at me
