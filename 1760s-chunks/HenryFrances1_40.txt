but they happened to meet  at a third Place  just before the following Letter was written  and Frances made a Request that he would return all her Letters  being resolved to take Leave of the Correspondence for Life  But the following Epistles soon reconciled them to each other again     132  LETTER LXXVII  Elton  HENRY to FRANCES   I HAVE brought your Letters thus far  that I might flatter myself with the Possession of them  Half a Day longer  and that they may be the less Time  between your Hands and mine  as I can intercept the Stage this Day  at Dinner   I was several Times tempted to break my Word with you  for the first Time  I declare  lest the Recollection  which these dear Memorandums may give you  of your having once loved me so well  may provoke you now to hate me  even more than you do  I return them then to you as the only Equivalent I could ever make you  for their Value  and from a Principle  I have some where before mentioned  that I shall never desire any Tye over the Person I love  but their own Inclinations  and this is the Reason perhaps  that I never married yet  tho  never tempted to it  but once in my Life  and for their Sake  more than my own  rejoice now that it never happened   In Return for your Letters  you offered me mine  but I desired you to burn them  which   133 I now revoke  leaving them intirely at your Disposal  for the only Reason I had for destroying them was  that they might never be ashamed  in Company with yours  but  as I beg you will keep them safe  mine may serve to explain  or illustrate some Passages  for Foils they want not   I often refused you your Letters  and should ever have continued obstinate in that Point  while I had any Hopes of pleasing you otherways  but  in that Despair  part madly with the only Things  which can please myself now   In order to make this Sacrifice the stronger  I read over all your Letters  before I parted with them  tho  this was a fond Folly  as I am very sure  I had every one of them by Heart before  And now  my ever best loved Girl  accept these returned  dear Pledges  as a Sacrifice fit for the Gods  religiously so  as  I flatter myself  from former Recollection  the Heart joined in the Address  Let them boast of Inspiration  if heavenly Spirits can taste of Vanity  of this Loan you have acquitted yourself back with Interest  for the Rays of Inspiration  like Sun beams  give Light in the direct Line  but owe their Heat to Reflection   I kept all your Letters  as they were wrote by you  and restore them now  because  I believe  you repent your ever having wrote them   Lifeless Charms  without the Heart     134I shall always remember  with Love and Gratitude  any Kindness you ever shewed me  I unfeignedly forgive the severe Treatment  I have lately met with  from you  and shall hereafter rest satisfied  in whatever Light you are pleased to regard me   As a Lover  Friend  Companion  or most humble and obedient Servant   LETTER LXXVIII   SIR   THO  your Politeness forbid your desiring an Acknowledgment of the most trifling Favour with Regard to yourself  and the most material one with Regard to me  that you have perhaps ever conferred  yet  as I never meant  tho  I may have failed in the Execution of my Design  to be out done in Generosity  I now think it incumbent on me to offer my Thanks  not according to the Value of the Present  but to the Design of the Giver  —Were I not afraid of appearing insolent  or ungrateful  I need not have had Resource to this Method of shewing my Gratitude  since I could  with more   135 Ease to myself  and  I am sure  Pleasure to you  have returned the Obligation an hundred Fold   but the Author  whom I have oftenest quoted to you  and is  of Course  my greatest Favourite  says    It is the highest Act of Ingratitude to overpay an Obligation  which we receive from an Equal  or Superior   — In which of these Denominations you are pleased to stile yourself  I shall  on this Occasion  subscribe myself     Your most obliged  and most obedient Servant  Frances   LETTER LXXIX  HENRY to FRANCES   I SHOULD have answered your Letter sooner  but waited  till I came here  both because I have some Pleasure in writing to you  from the Scene  whence most of my Letters were dated to you  and that I hope the Inclosed † will be some Apology for the Freedom of writing to you now  not from the Value of the Present  but from the Obedience  I shall always be proud    unnumbered 〈1  duplicate〉   unnumbered 〈1  duplicate〉  134〈1  duplicate〉  135〈1  duplicate〉  136 to shew to any
