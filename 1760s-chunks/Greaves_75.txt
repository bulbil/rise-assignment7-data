neighbours  Mr  Elmy  finding him obstinately deaf to all proposals of accommodation  held the defendants to very moderate bail  the landlord and the curate of the parish freely offering themselves as sureties  Mr  Clarke  with Timothy Crabshaw  against whom nothing appeared  were now set at liberty  when the former  advancing to his worship  gave information against Geoffrey Prickle  and declared upon oath that he had seen him assault Captain Crowe without any provocation  and when he  the deponent  interposed to prevent further mischief  the said Prickle had likewise assaulted and wounded him  the deponent  and detained him for some time in false imprisonment  without warrant or authority   In consequence of this information  which was corroborated by divers evidences  selected from the mob at the gate  the tables were turned upon farmer Prickle  who was given to understand  that he must either find bail  or be forthwith imprisoned  This honest boor  who was in opulent circumstances  had made such popular use of the benefits he possessed  that there was not a housekeeper in the parish who would not have rejoiced to see him hanged  His dealings and connexions  however  were such  that none of the other four would have refused to bail him  had not Clarke given them to understand that  if they did  he would make them all principals and parties  and have two separate actions against each  Prickle happened to be at variance with the innkeeper  and the curate durst not disoblige the vicar  who at that very time was suing the farmer for the small tithes  He offered to deposit a sum equal to the recognisance of the knight s bail  but this was rejected  as an expedient contrary to the practice of the courts  He sent for the attorney of the village  to whom he had been a good customer  but the lawyer was hunting evidence in another county  The exciseman presented himself as a surety  but he not being an housekeeper  was not accepted  Divers cottagers  who depended on farmer Prickle  were successively refused  because they could not prove that they had paid scot and lot  and parish taxes   The farmer  finding himself thus forlorn  and in imminent danger of visiting the inside of a prison  was seized with a paroxysm of rage  during which he inveighed against the bench  reviled the two adventurers errant  declared that he believed  and would lay a wager of twenty guineas  that he had more money in his pocket than e er a man in the company  and in the space of a quarter of an hour swore forty oaths  which the justice did not fail to number   Before we proceed to other matters   said Mr  Elmy   I order you to pay forty shillings for the oaths you have sworn  otherwise I will cause you to be set in the stocks without further ceremony    Prickle  throwing down a couple of guineas  with two execrations more to make up the sum  declared that he could afford to pay for swearing as well as e er a justice in the county  and repeated his challenge of the wager  which our adventurer now accepted  protesting  at the same time  that it was not a step taken from any motive of pride  but entirely with a view to punish an insolent plebeian  who could not otherwise be chastised without a breach of the peace  Twenty guineas being deposited on each side in the hands of Mr  Elmy  Prickle  with equal confidence and despatch  produced a canvas bag  containing two hundred and seventy pounds  which  being spread upon the table  made a very formidable show  that dazzled the eyes of the beholders  and induced many of them to believe he had ensured his conquest   Our adventurer  asking if he had anything further to offer  and being answered in the negative  drew forth  with great deliberation  a pocket book  in which there was a considerable parcel of bank notes  from which he selected three of one hundred pounds each  and exhibited them upon the table  to the astonishment of all present  Prickle  mad with his overthrow and loss  said  it might be necessary to make him prove the notes were honestly come by  and Sir Launcelot started up  in order to take vengeance upon him for this insult  but was withheld by the arms and remonstrances of Mr  Elmy  who assured him that Prickle desired nothing so much as another broken head  to lay the foundation of a new prosecution   The knight  calmed by this interposition  turned to the audience  saying  with the most affable deportment   Good people  do not imagine that I intend to pocket the spoils of such a contemptible rascal  I shall beg the favour of this worthy gentleman to take up these twenty guineas  and distribute them as he shall think proper among the poor of the parish  but  by this benefaction  I do not hold myself acquitted for the share I had in the bruises some of you have received in this unlucky fray  and therefore I give the other twenty guineas to be divided among the sufferers  to each according to the damage he or she shall appear to have sustained
