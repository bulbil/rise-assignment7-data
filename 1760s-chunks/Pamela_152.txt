is a mercy you stood proof in that fatal moment       Then he most kindly folded me in his arms  Let us  say I too  my Pamela    walk from this accursed piece of water  for I shall not  with pleasure    look upon it again  to think how near it was to have been fatal to my   fair one  I thought  added he  of terrifying you to my will  since I   could not move you by love  and Mrs  Jewkes too well obeyed me  when the   terrors of your return  after your disappointment  were so great  that   you had hardly courage to withstand them  but had like to have made so   fatal a choice  to escape the treatment you apprehended       O sir  said I  I have reason  I am sure  to bless my dear parents    and my good lady  your mother  for giving me something of a religious   education  for  but for that  and God s grace  I should  more than upon   one occasion  have attempted  at least  a desperate act  and I the less   wonder how poor creatures  who have not the fear of God before their   eyes  and give way to despondency  cast themselves into perdition       Come  kiss me  said he  and tell me you forgive me for pushing you into   so much danger and distress  If my mind hold  and I can see those former   papers of yours  and that these in my pocket give me no cause to altar   my opinion  I will endeavour to defy the world and the world s censures    and make my Pamela amends  if it be in the power of my whole life  for   all the hardships I have made her undergo       All this looked well  but you shall see how strangely it was all turned    For this sham marriage then came into my mind again  and I said  Your   poor servant is far unworthy of this great honour  for what will it be   but to create envy to herself  and discredit to you  Therefore  sir    permit me to return to my poor parents  and that is all I have to ask       He was in a fearful passion then  And is it thus  said he  in my fond   conceding moments  that I am to be despised and answered   Precise    perverse  unseasonable Pamela  begone from my sight  and know as well   how to behave in a hopeful prospect  as in a distressful state  and   then  and not till then  shalt thou attract the shadow of my notice       I was startled  and going to speak  but he stamped with his foot  and   said  Begone  I tell you  I cannot bear this stupid romantic folly       One word  said I  but one word  I beseech you  sir       He turned from me in great wrath  and took down another alley  and so I   went  with a very heavy heart  and fear I was too unseasonable  just at   a time when he was so condescending  but if it was a piece of art of his   side  as I apprehended  to introduce the sham wedding   and  to be sure    he is very full of stratagem and art   I think I was not so much to   blame       So I went up to my closet  and wrote thus far  while he walked about   till dinner was ready  and he is now sat down to it  as I hear by Mrs    Jewkes  very sullen  thoughtful  and out of humour  and she asks  What   I have done to him   Now  again  I dread to see him   When will my fears   be over          Three o clock       Well  he continues exceeding wrath  He has ordered his travelling   chariot to be got ready with all speed  What is to come next  I wonder       Sure I did not say so much   But see the lordliness of a high   condition   A poor body must not put in a word  when they take it into   their heads to be angry  What a fine time a person of an equal condition   would have of it  if she were even to marry such a one   His poor dear   mother spoiled him at first  Nobody must speak to him or contradict him    as I have heard  when he was a child  and so he has not been used to   be controlled  and cannot
