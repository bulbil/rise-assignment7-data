like them too  furnish the whole Expence yourself   For my Part  I declare  that  in general  I both like and esteem Women better than Men  they often excite the Exercise of the most pleasing Virtues  Generosity  Honour  and Compassion  they inspire us with the whole   petites Morales   as the French not unaptly term them  of Complacency  Politeness  and Gentleness of Manners  without which  as you say  we had been Brutes indeed     I never feel myself intirely chearful  but in their Company  for Sprightliness and good Humour more particularly become you  than us  as your gayer and more poetical Reading  with almost an intire Vacation from Business  enable you better to exert them  In short  what was said of Musick  may very justly be applied to your Sex      66  Women  the Cordial of a troubled Breast   The softest Remedy  that Grief can find   The gentle Spell  which lulls our Cares to Rest   And calms the ruffling Passions of the Mind     Your Sense too is of a prettier  and purer Kind  than our s  un incumbered with logical Distinctions  and untainted with the Subtleties of the Schools   you strike each Point   c    Your Virtues also are more constant and perfect than our s  as they flow from a natural Delicacy of Sentiment  a chaste Education  and a more implicit Sense of Religion  while our Morals  being first obscured by a libertine Youth  are to be brought to Light by the Labour of Thought and Reflection  then pass thro  the Hands of Legislators  who so mix and blend them with human Policies  that the very Spirit is evaporated  or else they are so subtilized by the Refinements of the Philosophers  that the intire Substance of Virtue is destroyed   I shall say no more now  on this Subject  but that  as I formerly hated the whole Sex  on Account of one Woman  I shall henceforward love them all for the Sake of another  in Consequence of which  I here throw this Palinode at your Feet   Henry     67  I cannot resist a Piece of Pertness  in Answer to the last Paragraph of your last Letter  by observing  that  whether  Knowledge was originally designed for Women  or no  I cannot tell  but she certainly was the first who tasted of it   LETTER XLII  HENRY to FRANCES   ROCHFAUCAULT  or some other Maxim monger  has these Words    It is a common Thing  with some People  to exclaim against Inconstancy  at the same Time that they are pleased  to have an Example of Change  for sometimes the warmest Love and strictest Friendship insensibly slacken  and we then seek a Quarrel  merely to have some Pretence to set ourselves at Liberty     This  my dear Fanny  seems really to be your Case  for I ll be sworn  there is not the least Colour  in any of my Letters  for such a Charge against me  I have not found Fault  because I would not wrong you  with any of your Words  or Actions  I have not taken it into my Head  that you seem tired of the Commerce between us  either in Conversation or Correspondence  nor have I ever sought a Pretence   68 to put an End to it  So far from it  that  tho  you have so fairly  say unfairly  put one in my Way  by your last extraordinary Epistle  I will not take the Advantage of it  tho  it has a Recommendation  which could make me do almost any Thing else  namely  your Request   You desire too  that I would return you all your Letters  for indeed I have them all  but this too I must refuse you  for I should part even with your Writings  with more Reluctance  than it seems you would have  in resigning mine  and their Author too  to help out the Bargain  which I do not think an Equivalent for the Exchange you require  and I am too poor in Wit  to part with any Thing for less than its full Value  tho   perhaps  it would be but slightly prized  if known how little I gave for it   Tho  I will not part with any Thing of your s  you see how readily I give you what belongs either to myself or others  I send you inclosed a Lock of my Hair  which you desired  when I saw you last  and  to pay the highest Compliment to female Vanity and Triumph  I also send you a Locket  to put it in  which was given me by a very pretty Woman  whose Hair I have taken out  and burned this Day in the Midst of some of her Letters  which I had by me   Adieu   Henry     69  LETTER XLIII   I RECEIVED my dear Harry s Letter  and am much better pleased to acquit  than condemn you  for  as somebody says  I think it is Pope    To
