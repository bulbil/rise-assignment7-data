moves in my sphere  My young client promised to be sincere in his representation  and began his narrative in the following words       CH  VIII     History of Don Roger de Rada   DON ANASTASIO DE RADA  a gentleman of Grenada  was living happily in the town of Antequera  with Donna Estephania his wife  who united every charm of person and mind with the most unquestionable virtue  If her affection was lively towards her husband  his love for her was violent beyond all bounds  He was naturally prone to jealousy  and though wantonness could never assume such a semblance as his wife s  his thoughts were not quite at rest upon the subject  He was apprehensive lest some secret enemy to his repose might make some attempt upon his honour  His eye was turned askance upon all his friends  except Don Huberto de Hordales  who frequented the house without suspicion in quality of Estephania s cousin  and was the only man in whom he ought not to have confided   Don Huberto did actually fall in love with his cousin  and ventured to make his sentiments known  in contempt of consanguinity and the ties of friendship  The lady  who was considerate  instead of making an outcry which might have led to fatal consequences  reproved her kinsman gently  represented to him the extreme criminality of attempting to seduce her and dishonour her husband  and told him very seriously that he must not flatter himself with the most distant hope   This moderation only inflamed the seducer s appetite the more  Taking it for granted that  as a woman who had been accustomed to save appearances  she only wanted to be more strongly urged  he began to adopt little freedoms of more warmth than delicacy  and had the assurance one day to put the question home to her  She repulsed him with unbridled indignation  and threatened to refer the punishment of his offence to Don Anastasio  Her suitor  alarmed at such an intimation  promised to drop the subject  and Estephania in the candour of her soul forgave him for the past   Don Huberto  a man totally devoid of principle  could not feel his passion to be foiled  without entertaining a mean spirit of revenge  He knew the weak side of Don Anastasio s temper  This was enough to engender the blackest design that ever scoundrel plotted  One evening as he was walking alone with this misguided husband  he said with an air of extreme uneasiness  My dear friend  I can no longer live without unburdening my mind  and yet I would be for ever silent  but that you value honour far above a treacherous repose  Your acute feelings and my own  on points which concern domestic injuries  forbid me to conceal what is passing in your family  Prepare to hear what will occasion you as much grief as astonishment  I am going to wound you in the tenderest part   I know what you mean  interrupted Don Anastasio  in the first bunt of agony  your cousin is unfaithful  I no longer acknowledge her for my cousin  replied Hordales with impassioned vehemence  I disown her  as unworthy to share my friend s embraces  This is keeping me too long upon the rack  exclaimed Don Anastasio  say on  what has Estephania done  She has betrayed you  replied Don Huberto  You have a rival to whom she listens in private  but I cannot give you his name  for the adulterer  under favour of impenetrable darkness  has escaped the ken of those who watched him  All I know is  that you are duped  of that fact I am well assured  My own share in the disgrace is a sufficient pledge of my veracity  Her infidelity must be palpable indeed  when I turn Estephania s accuser   It is to no purpose  continued he  watching the successful impression of his discourse  it is to no purpose to discuss the subject further  I perceive your indignation at the treacherous requital of your love  and your thoughts all aiming at a just revenge  Take your own course  Heed not in what relation to you your victim may stand  but convince the whole city that there is no earthly being whom you would not sacrifice to your honour   Thus did the traitor exasperate a too credulous husband against an innocent wife  depicting in such glowing colours the infamy in which he would be plunged if he left the insult unpunished  as to heighten his anger into madness  Behold Don Anastasio  with his mind completely overturned  as if goaded by the furies  He returned homewards with the frantic design of murdering his ill  fated wife  She was just going to bed when he came in  He kept his passion under for a time  and waited till the attendants had withdrawn  Then  unrestrained by the fear of vengeance from above  by the vulgar scorn which must recoil upon an honourable family  by natural affection for his unborn child  since his wife was near her time  he approached his victim  and said to her in a furious tone of voice  Now is your hour to die  wretch as you are  One moment only is your own  which my relenting pity leaves you to make your peace with heaven  I would
