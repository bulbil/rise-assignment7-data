 and therefore begged to be helped from a piece of beef that lay on the side table  my request at once disconcerted the whole company  A Chinese eat beef  that could never be  there was no local propriety in Chinese beef  whatever there might be in Chinese pheasant  Sir  said my entertainer  I think I have some reasons to fancy myself a judge of these matters  in short  the Chinese never eat beef  so that I must be permitted to recommend the Pilaw  there was never better dressed at Pekin  the saffron and rice are well boiled  and the spices in perfection   I had no sooner begun to eat what was laid before me  than I found the whole company as much astonished as before  it seems I made no use of my chop sticks  A grave gentleman  whom I take to be an author  harangued very learnedly  as the company seemed to think  upon the use which was made of them in China  he entered into a long argument with himself about their   137 first introduction  without once appealing to me  who might be supposed best capable of silencing the enquiry  As the gentleman therefore took my silence for a mark of his own superior sagacity  he was resolved to pursue the triumph  he talked of our cities  mountains  and animals  as familiarly as if he had been born in Quamsi  but as erroneously as if a native of the moon  he attempted to prove that I had nothing of the the true Chinese cut in my visage  shewed that my cheek bones should have been higher  and my forehead broader  in short  he almost reasoned me out of my country  and effectually persuaded the rest of the company to be of his opinion   I was going to expose his mistakes  when it was insisted that I had nothing of the true eastern manner in my delivery  This gentleman s conversation  says one of the ladies  who was a great reader  is like our own  mere chit chat and common sense  there is nothing like sense in the true eastern style  where nothing more is required but sublimity  Oh for an history of Aboulfaouris  the grand voyager  of genii  magicians  rocks  bags of bullets  giants  and enchanters  where all is great  obscure  magnificent  and unintelligible  I have written many a sheet of eastern tale myself  interrupts the author  and I defy the severest critic to say but that I have stuck close to the true manner  I have compared a lady s chin to the snow upon the mountains of Bomek  a soldier s sword  to the clouds that obscure the face of heaven If riches are mentioned  I compare them to the flocks that graze the verdant Tefflis  if poverty  to the mists that veil   138 the brow of mount Baku  I have used thee and thou upon all occasions  I have described fallen stars  and splitting mountains  not forgetting the little Houries who make a very pretty figure in every description  But you shall hear how I generally begin   Eben ben bolo  who was the son of Ban  was born on the foggy summits of Benderabassi  His beard was whiter than the feathers which veil the breast of the Penguin  his eyes were like the eyes of doves  when washed by the dews of the morning  his hair  which hung like the willow weeping over the glassy stream  was so beautiful that it seem d to reflect its own brightness  and his feet were as the feet of a wild deer which fleeth to the tops of the mountains   There  there  is the true eastern taste for you  every advance made towards sense  is only a deviation from found  Eastern tales should always be sonorous  lofty  musical and unmeaning   I could not avoid smiling to hear a native of England attempt to instruct me in the true eastern idiom  and after he had look d round some time for applause  I presumed to ask him whether he had ever travelled into the east  to which he replied in the negative  I demanded whether he understood Chinese or Arabic  to which also he answered as before  Then how  Sir  said I  can you pretend to determine upon the eastern stile  who are entirely unacquainted with the eastern writings  Take  Sir  the word of one who is professed•y a Chinese  and who is actually acquainted with the Arabian writers  that what is palm d upon you daily for an imitation of eastern writing  no ways resembles their manner  either in sentiment or diction  In the east  similes are seldom   139 used  and metaphors almost wholly unknown  but in China particularly  the very reverse of what you allude to  takes place  a cool phlegmatic method of writing prevails there  The writers of that country  ever more assiduous to instruct than to please  address rather the judgment than the fancy  Unlike  many authors of Europe  who have no consideration of the reader s time  they generally leave more to be understood than they express   Besides  Sir  you must not expect from an inhabitant of China the same ignorance  the same unlettered simplicity  that
