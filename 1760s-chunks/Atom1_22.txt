terms and denominations which are known in this metropolis     Fika kaka  having considered this work with astonishment  and heard the populace declare upon oath  that they would exalt their orator above all competition  was again addressed by the invincible Taycho     Your Quanbukuship perceives how bootless it will be to strive against the torrent —What need is there of many words  admit me to a share of the administration—I will commence your humble slave—I will protect the farm at the expence of Japan  while there is an Oban left in the island of Niphon  and I will muzzle these bears so effectually  that they shall not shew their teeth  except    119 in applauding our proceedings    An author who sees the apparition of a bailiff standing before him in his garret  and instead of being shewn a capias  is presented with a bank note  an impatient lover stopped upon Bagshot heath by a person in a masque  who proves to be his sweetheart come to meet him in disguise  for the sake of the frolick  a condemned criminal  who  on the morning of execution day  instead of being called upon by the finisher of the law  is visited by the sheriff with a free pardon  could not be more agreeably surprised than was Fika kaka at the demagogue s declaration  He flew into his embrace and wept aloud with joy  calling him his dear Taycho  He squeezed his hand  kissed him on both cheeks  and swore he should share the better half of all his power  then he laughed and snivelled by turns  lolled out his tongue     120 waddled about the chamber  wriggled and niggled and noddled  Finally  he undertook to prepare the Dairo for his reception  and it was agreed that the orator should wait on his new colleague next morning —This matter being settled to their mutual satisfaction  Taycho retreated through the window into the courtyard  and was convoyed home in triumph by that many headed hydra the mob  which shook its multitudinous tail  and brayed through every throat with hideous exultation     The Cuboy  mean while  had another trial to undergo  a trial which he had not foreseen  Taycho was no sooner departed  than he hied him to the Dairo s cabinet  in order to communicate the happy success of his negotiation  But at certain periods  Got hama baba s resentment was more than a match for any other passion that belonged to his disposition  and now it was its turn to    121 reign  The Dairo was made of very combustible materials  and these had been kindled up by the appearance of orator Taycho  who  he knew  had treated his person with indecent freedoms  and publickly vilified the worship of the White Horse  When Fika kaka  therefore  told him he had made peace with the demagogue  the Dairo  instead of giving him the kick of approbation  turned his own back upon the Cuboy  and silenced him with a boh  Had Fika kaka assailed him with the same syllogistical sophism which was used by the Stagyrite to Alexander in a passion  perhaps he might have listened to reason  〈 in non Latin alphabet 〉 —   Anger should be raised not by our equals  but by our superiors  but you have no equal    —Certain it is  that Got hama baba had no equal  but Fika kaka was no more like Aristotle  than his master resembled    122 Alexander  The Dairo remained deaf to all his remonstrances  tears  and intreaties  until he declared that there was no other way of saving the farm  but that of giving charte blanche to Taycho  This argument seemed at once to dispel the clouds which had been compelled by his indignation  he consented to receive the orator in quality of minister  and next day was appointed for his introduction     In the morning Taycho the Great repaired to the palace of the Cuboy  where he privately performed the ceremony of osculation a posteriori  sung a solemn Palinodia on the subject of political system  repeated and signed the Buponian creed  embraced the religion of Fakkubasi  and adored the White Horse with marks of unfeigned piety and contrition  Then he was conducted to the antichamber of the emperor  who could not  without great difficulty  so far master    123 his personal dislike  as to appear before him with any degree of composure  He was brought forth by Fika kaka like a tame bear to the stake  if that epithet of tame can be given with any propriety to an animal which no body but his keeper dares approach  The orator perceiving him advance  made a low obeisance according to the custom of Japan  that is  by bending the body averse from the Dairo  and laying the right hand upon the left buttock  and pronounced with an audible voice     Behold  invincible Got hama baba  a sincere penitent come to make atonement for his virulent opposition to your government  for his atrocious insolence to your sacred person  I have calumniated your favourite farm  I have questioned your integrity  I have vilified your character  ridiculed your understanding  and despised your authority   —This recapitulation was so disagreeable to    124 the Dairo  that he
