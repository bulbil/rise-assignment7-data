merely in revenge for   her late treatment  had there been the least shadow of a pretence for   doing so   gladly would she have encouraged such a hope  but common   sense forbid it   all circumstances seemed to concur  in proving that he   was indeed that villain which the letter represented him  and that   surprize  which had in a manner stupified her on the discovery  was   succeeded by a storm of mingled grief and rage  which no words can   sufficiently describe   she exclaimed against fate  cursed all mankind    and accused every thing as accessory to her misfortune  but that to   which alone she owed it  her own imprudence       The disorders of her mind had such an effect on her body  that she fell   into fits  and a physician was sent for  who  tho  esteemed the most   skilful in that country  found it required all his art to prevent a   fever  she continued  however  for five days in a condition  such as   permitted her not to do any thing either for the satisfaction of her own   impatient curiosity  or to comply with the just request Louisa had made    and had not monsieur du Plessis s letter to the prince been mere   successful  they must both have continued where they were  perhaps for a   considerable time       That  however  had all the effect could be expected from a prince of so   much honour  he immediately sent for the count de Bellfleur  and easily   finding  by the confusion with which he replied to his examination  and   the little low evasions he was obliged to have recourse to  that the   affair was as monsieur du Plessis had represented  gave him a severe   check  and ordered him to depart immediately from Venice  where he told   him  he had given such occasion to call the honour of the French nation   in general in question  and to repair with all expedition to his winter   quarters  Which command he instantly obeyed  without taking any leave of   Melanthe  or perhaps even thinking on her       At the same time the prince dispatched his gentleman of horse to Padua    with necessary instructions for clearing up the affair  on which the   prisoners were discharged  and their pardon asked by the podestat for   doing what  he said  the duties of his post had alone obliged him to    tho  it is certain he had exercised his authority with greater   strictness than the necessity of the thing required  since  if the count   had been in reality the husband of Louisa  it would have been more easy   for him to bring proofs of it  than for those under confinement to   invalidate his claim       After the proper compliments to the gentleman who had taken this   trouble  monsieur du Plessis entreated he would excuse him to the   prince  that he retarded the thanks he had to pay his royal highness    till his return from conducting Louisa some part of her journey  which   being a piece of gallantry the lady herself seemed well pleased with    was easily complied with by the other       This faithful lover had now a full opportunity to entertain his mistress   with his passion  and represented it to her with so much force and   eloquence  together with the dangers she would continually be exposed   to  that she had at length no words to form denials  and gave him leave   to conduct her to some monastry in Italy  the choice of which she left   to him  till the campaign was over  This was indeed all he presumed to   request of her at present  It may happen  said he  that your lover may   fall a victim to the fate of war  among many other more brave and worthy   men  who doubtless will not survive the next battle  and you will then   be at liberty to pursue your inclinations either to England or   elsewhere  and be assured of this  that I shall take care  before the   hour of danger  to leave you mistress of a fortune  sufficient to protect   you from any future insults of the nature you received from Melanthe       The tender soul of Louisa was so much dissolved at these words  that she   burst into a flood of tears  and cried out  Oh  too generous du Plessis    think not I will survive the cruel hour which informs me all that is   valuable in man has ceased to be   Take   oh  take no care for me  when   you are no more  nothing this world affords can enable me to drag on a   wretched life       What must be the transport of a man  who loved
