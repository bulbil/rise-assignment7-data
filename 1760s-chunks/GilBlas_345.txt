of promotions  military  ecclesiastical  and civil   What you have told me about Calderona  cried the minister with eagerness  exactly squares with certain memorials which have been presented to me  containing the heads of charges still more seriously affecting his character  He will very soon be put upon his trial  and if you have any wish to glut your revenge by his ruin  I am of opinion that the object of your desire is near at hand  I am far from thirsting after his blood  said I  though had it depended on him  mine might have been shed in the tower of Segovia  where he was the occasion of my taking lodgings for a pretty long term  What  inquired his excellency  was it Don Rodrigo who procured you that sudden journey  this a part of the story of which I was not aware before  Don Balthasar  to whom Navarro gave a summary of your adventures  told me indeed that the late king gave orders for your commitment  as a mark of his indignation against you for having led the Prince of Spain astray  and taken him to a house of suspicious character in the night  but that is all I know of the matter  and cannot for the life of me conjecture what part Calderona could possibly have had to play in that tragicomedy  A principal part  whether on the stage or in real life  answered I that of a jealous lover  taking vengeance for an injury  sustained in the tenderest point  At the same time I related minutely all the facts with which the reader is already acquainted  and touched his risible propensities  difficult as they were of access  so exactly in the right place  that he could not help wagging his under hung jaw in a paroxysm of humour stricken ecstasy  and laughing till he cried again  Catalina s double cast in the drama delighted him exceedingly  her sometimes playing the niece and sometimes personating the grand daughter seemed to tickle his fancy more than anything  nor was he altogether inattentive to the appearance which the Duke of Lerma made in this undignified farce of state  When I had finished my story  the count gave me leave to depart  with an assurance that on the next day he would not fail to make trial of my talents for business  I ran immediately to the family hotel of Zuniga  to thank Don Balthazar for his good offices  and to acquaint my friend Joseph with the favourable dispositions of the prime minister  and my brilliant prospects in con sequence       CH  V     The private conversation of Gil Blas with Navarro  and his first employment in the service of the Count d Olivarez   As soon as I got to the ear of Joseph  I told him with much trepidation of spirits what a world of topics I had to deposit in his private ear  He took me where we might be alone  when I asked him  after having communicated a key to the whole transaction up to the present time  what he thought of the business as it stood  I think  answered he  that you are in a fair way to make an enormous fortune  Everything turns out according to your wishes  you have made yourself acceptable to the prime minister  and what must be taken for some thing in the account  I can render you the same service as my uncle Melchior de la Ronda  when you attached yourself to the archiepiscopal establishment of Grenada  He spared you the trouble of finding out the weak side of that prelate and his principal officers  by discovering their different characters to you  and it is my purpose  after his example  to bring you perfectly acquainted with the count  his lady countess  and their only daughter  Donna Maria de Guzman   The minister s parts are quick  his judgment penetrating  and his talents altogether calculated for the formation of extensive projects  He affects the credit of universal genius  on the strength of a showy smattering in general science  so that there is no subject  in his own opinion  too difficult to be decided on his mere authority  He sets himself up for a practical lawyer  a complete general  and a politician of thorough paced sagacity  Add to all this  that he is so obstinately wedded to his own opinions  as unchangeably to persevere in the path of his own chalking out  to the absolute contempt of better advice  for fear of seeming to be influenced by any good sense or intelligence  but what he would be thought to engross in the resources of his own mind  Between ourselves  this blot in his character may produce strange consequences  which it may be well for the monarchy should indulgent heaven for the defect of human means avert  As for his talents in council  he shines in debate by the force of natural eloquence  and would write as well as he speaks  if he did not injudiciously affect a certain dignity of style  which degenerates into affectation  quaintness  and obscurity  His modes of thinking are peculiar to himself  he is capricious in conduct  and visionary in design  Here you have the picture of his mind  the light and shade of his intellectual merits  the qualities of his heart and disposition remain to
