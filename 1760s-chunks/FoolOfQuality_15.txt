s lifetime  under the title of The History of Henry    Earl of Moreland  He reduced the bulk by at least one   third  omitting what he calls   the uninteresting dialogues     between the author and his friend  as well as divers   incidents   that would give little entertainment to men of   understanding    He also omitted   great part of the Mystic   Divinity  as it is more philosophical than scriptural     Wesley s preface is interesting for its candour  the   criticisms are very free  but the praise is obviously sincere    and full of discernment  It is worth while quoting a letter   written by Wesley to Henry Brooke Junior from Hull    8th July  1774  as it helps to explain how he came to   adopt the book       DEAR HARRY  When I read over in Ireland The Fool of Quality    I could not but observe the design of it  to promote the religion of the   heart  and that it was well calculated to answer that design   the same   thing I observed a week or two ago  concerningyiw z  Grenville  Yet   there seemed to me to be a few passages both in the one and in the   other which might be altered for the better   I do not mean so much   with regard to the sentiments  which are generally very just  as with   regard to the structure of the story  which seemed here and there to   be not quite clear  I had at first a thought of writing to Mr  Brooke   himself  but I did not know whether I might take the liberty  Few   authors will thank you for imagining you are able to correct their   works  But if he could bear it  and think it would be of any use  I   would give another reading to both these works  and send him my   thoughts without reserve  just as they occur      Ten years ago  a well known writer stated in an article   on The Fool of Quality  that Wesley coolly appropriated   the book  cutting out what did not meet with his approval     and had the impudence and dishonesty to publish it   thus mutilated  without the author s consent  and in his   lifetime  under a slightly altered title       and thus   doctored  this book has been passed off as a composition         xxviii INTRODUCTION     of the great head and founder of Methodism   This  as   was instantly pointed out by correspondents  is not quite   true  It is contradicted by Wesley s own preface   and   the fact that Brooke granted permission is confirmed by   a letter from Henry Brooke Junior  which contains the   following passage       He  Henry Brooke Senior  is deeply sensible of your very kind   offer and most cordially embraces it  He has desired me to express the   warmth of his gratitude in the strongest terms  and says he most cheer    fully yields the volumes you mention to your superior judgment  to   prune  erase  and alter as you please  He only wishes they could have   had your eye before they appeared in public  But it is not yet too   late  A second edition will appear to great advantage when they have   undergone so kind a revisal  But he is apprehensive your time is so   precious that it may be too great an intrusion upon it  unless made a   work of leisure and opportunity  Yet  as you have proffered it  he will   not give up the privilege   but hope leisure may be found for so friendly   and generous a work       The first two volumes of The Fool of Quality were quickly   sold out  and a second edition was called for in 1767  The   publisher was W  Johnson  of Ludgate Street  Wesley s   version also went through a large number of editions  and   was indeed the form in which the book was best known    until the two volume edition appeared in 1859 with   Kingsley s preface  The book is as puzzling to describe   as  say  The Anatomy of Melancholy  or The Doctor  It is   not only a novel  but also a commonplace book  contain    ing the author s thoughts on ethics and social economy    politics  religion  aesthetics  and indeed as many multifarious   topics as those dealt with in the digressions of La Nouvelle   Htio ist itself  Such a theme as the youth and education   of an ideal nobleman gives ample opportunity for wide   meandering      Kingsley s praise is enthusiastic  but not undiscriminating    His appreciation of Henry Brooke is eminently just
