 are likely to be so considerable  Others may have their liberties to support  you must sustain your liberty  your property  and the dignity of your station  I shall therefore  without farther preface  in some future correspondence  communicate the result of my enquiries on this subject  a subject which  I own  has employed all the leisure I had to spare from  I will not say more important  but more necessary duties  I shall endeavour  at once  to supply the facts  and the necessary consequences that may be deduced from them  I shall separate all that can contribute nothing  either for amusement or use  and  leave such to dull compilers  or systematic writers of history  whose only boast it is to leave nothing out  A more thorough knowledge of the subject can not be communicated  without pain  nor acquired without study  perhaps too minute a skill in this  or any one subject  might disqualify the mind for other branches of science  equally demanding your care  Of whatever use it may be  I hope you will consider it as an instance of my regard  and  though it should fail to improve    13 yet I hope it may remain a sufficient testimony  how much I am   Dear Charles   c   LETTER III   Dear Charles   THERE seems to be a natural tendency  in every nation  to run its antiquity as far back as possible  and when once they have arrived at the regions of fiction  no bounds are set to the wonders of every narration  Were we to take our character of the ancient inhabitants of this island  from the legends  monuments  or traditions  which have been left by those inhabitants themselves  we might be apt to imagine that arts  even in that early period  were cultivated  and sciences known to some degree of perfection  The Druids  if we believe some fragments of their own  understood astronomy and medicine  and gave lessions in morality and metaphysics  But what credit can be given to the accounts of a barbarous people  told by themselves  The knowledge and learning  indeed  of their priests  might be great  if compared with the almost brutal simplicity and ignorance of the rest of the people  but it could not deserve the name of science  if put in competition with what was known and practised by their polite cotemporaries of Greece and Rome   From the accounts of those sensible writers  and not from the fictitious absurdities of the Druids themselves  we are to estimate this ancient people of Britain  All that we find related by credible witnesses and sufficient authority  before the Romans   14 entered this island  is  that the country was filled with incredible numbers of people  and their fields stored with great plenty of animals  savage and domestic  Their houses were meanly built  and scattered  as if accidentally  over the country  without observance  distance  or order  The only motives of their choice were the peculiar fertility of some happy spot  or the convenience of wood and water  They lived upon milk  and flesh procured by the chace  for corn was scarcely known among them  What cloaths they wore were skins of beasts  but a great part of their bodies was left always exposed to the injuries of the weather  all that was naked being painted with blue  This custom of painting was universal among them  either in order to strike terror into their enemies  or to defend the pores of the naked skin from the vicissitudes of the season   Their towns  if a collection of huts could deserve that name  were mostly built upon the coasts  in such places as strangers generally resorted to for the sake of commerce  The commodities  exported  were chiefly hides and tin  and  probably  other spontaneous productions of the soil  which required no art in the preparation   Their government  like that of the ancient Gauls  consisted of several petty principalities  which seem to be the original governments of mankind  and deduced from the natural right of paternal dominion  but whether these little principalities descended by succession  or were elected by the consent of the people  is not recorded  Upon great or uncommon dangers  indeed  the chief commander of all their forces was chosen by common consent  in a general assembly  as Caesar relates of Cassibelaunus  upon his invasion  The same was   15 done upon their revolts against the Roman colonies  under Caractacus and their Queen Boadicea  for  among them  women were admitted to their principalities  and general commands  by the right of succession  merit  or nobility   Such were the customs of the ancient Britons  and the same may serve for a description of every other barbarous nation  of which we have any knowledge  Savage man  is an animal in almost every country the same  and all the difference between nations results from customs introduced by luxury  or cultivated by refinement  What the inhabitant of Britain was at that time  the inhabitant of South America  or Cafraria  may be at this day  But there was one custom  among the ancient inhabitants of this island  which seems peculiar to themselves  and is not
