by observing  that life was a voyage in which we must expect to meet with all weathers  sometimes it was calm  sometimes rough  that a fair gale often succeeded a storm  that the wind did not always sit one way  and that despair signified nothing  but resolution and skill were better than a stout vessel  For why  Because they require no carpenter  and grow stronger the more labour they undergo  I dried up my tears  which I   43 assured him  were not shed for my own distress  but for his  and begged leave to accompany him into another room  where we could converse more at our ease —There I recounted to him the ungenerous usage I had met with from Potion  at which he started up  stalked across the room three or four times  in a great hurry  and grasping his cudgel  cried    I would I were along side of him—that s all—I would I were along side of him  —  I then gave him a detail of all my adventures and sufferings  which affected him more than I could have imagined  and concluded with telling him that captain Oakhum was still alive  and that he might return to England when he would  to sollicite his affairs  without danger or molestation —He was wonderfully pleased at this piece of information  of which however  he said he could not at present avail himself  for want of money to pay for his passage to London  This objection I soon removed  by putting five guineas into his hand  and telling him  I thought myself extremely happy in having an opportunity of manifesting my gratitude to him in his necessity —But it was with the utmost difficulty I could prevail upon him to accept of two  which he affirmed  were more than sufficient to defray the necessary expence —After this friendly contest was over  he proposed we should have a mess of something    For  said he  it has been banyan day with me a great while —You must know I was shipwrecked five days ago  near a place called Lisieux  in company with those Dutchmen who are now drinking below  and having but little money when I came ashore  it was soon spent  because I let them   44 have share and share while it lasted —Howsomever  I should have remembred the old saying  Every hog his own apple  For when they found my hold unstowed  they went all hands to shooling and begging  and because I would not take a spell at the same duty  refused to give me the least assistance  so that I have not broke bread these two days  —  I was shocked at the extremity of his distress  and ordered some bread  cheese and wine to be brought immediately  to allay his hunger  until a fricassee of chickens could be prepared —When he had recruited his spirits with this homely fare  I desired to know the particulars of his peregrination  since the accident at Cape Tiberoon  which were briefly these  The money he had about him being all spent at Port Louis  the civility and hospitality of the French cooled to such a degree  that he was obliged to list on board of one of their king s ships  as a common fore mast man  to prevent himself from starving on shore —In this situation  he continued two years  during which time he had acquired some knowledge of their language  and the reputation of a good seaman  The ship he belonged to was ordered home to old France  where she was laid up as unfit for service  and he was received on board of one of monsieur D Antin s squadron  in quality of quarter master  which office he performed in a voyage to the West Indies  where they engaged with our ship  as before related  but his conscience upbraiding him for serving the enemies of his country  he quitted the ship at the same place where he first listed  and got to Currasoa in a Dutch vessel  there he bargained with another skipper  bound to Europe  to work for his passage   45 to Holland  from whence he was in hopes of hearing from his friends in England  but was cast away  as he mentioned before  on the French coast  and must have been reduced to the necessity of travelling on foot to Holland  and begging for his subsistence on the road  or of entering on board of another French man of war  at the hazard of being treated as a deserter  if Providence had not sent me to his succour —   And now  my lad   continued he  I think I shall steer my course directly to London  where I do not doubt of being replaced  and of having the R taken off me by the lords of the admiralty  to whom I intend to write a petition setting forth my case  If I succeed  I will have wherewithal to give you some assistance  because when I left the ship I had two years pay due to me  therefore I desire to know whither you are bound  and beside  perhaps  I may have interest enough to procure a warrant appointing you surgeon s mate of the ship to which I shall belong —For the beadle of the admiralty is my good friend  and
