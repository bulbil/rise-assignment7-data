habeas corpus  as the act including that inestimable jewel was happily not suspended at this time   Consoled by this self assurance  he quietly resigned himself to slumber  but before he fell asleep  he was very disagreeably undeceived in his conjecture  His ears were all at once saluted with a noise from the next room  conveyed in distinct bounces against the wainscot  then a hoarse voice exclaimed   Bring up the artillery—let Brutandorf s brigade advance—detach my black hussars to ravage the country—let them be new booted—take particular care of the spur leathers—make a desert of Lusatia—bombard the suburbs of Pera—go  tell my brother Henry to pass the Elbe at Meissen with forty battalions and fifty squadrons—so ho  you Major General Donder  why don t you finish your second parallel —send hither the engineer Shittenback—I ll lay all the shoes in my shop  the breach will be practicable in four and twenty hours—don t tell me of your works  you and your works be d—n d     Assuredly   cried another voice from a different quarter   he that thinks to be saved by works is in a state of utter reprobation—I myself was a profane weaver  and trusted to the rottenness of works—I kept my journeymen and  prentices at constant work  and my heart was set upon the riches of this world  which was a wicked work—but now I have got a glimpse of the new light—I feel the operations of grace—I am of the new birth—I abhor good works—I detest all working but the working of the Spirit—avaunt  Satan—O  how I thirst for communication with our sister Jolly     The communication is already open with the Marche   said the first   but as for thee  thou caitiff  who hast presumed to disparage my works  I ll have thee rammed into a mortar with a double charge of powder  and thrown into the enemy s quarters    This dialogue operated like a train upon many other inhabitants of the place  one swore he was within three vibrations of finding the longitude  when this noise confounded his calculation  a second  in broken English  complained he vas distorped in the moment of de proshection  a third  in the character of His Holiness  denounced interdiction  excommunication  and anathemas  and swore by St  Peter s keys  they should howl ten thousand years in purgatory  without the benefit of a single mass  A fourth began to halloo in all the vociferation of a fox hunter in the chase  and in an instant the whole house was in an uproar   The clamour  however  was of a short duration  The different chambers being opened successively  every individual was effectually silenced by the sound of one cabalistical word  which was no other than Waistcoat  A charm which at once cowed the King of P——  dispossessed the fanatic  dumbfounded the mathematician  dismayed the alchemist  deposed the Pope  and deprived the squire of all utterance   Our adventurer was no longer in doubt concerning the place to which he had been conveyed  and the more he reflected on his situation  the more he was overwhelmed with the most perplexing chagrin  He could not conceive by whose means he had been immured in a madhouse  but he heartily repented of his knight errantry  as a frolic which might have very serious consequences  with respect to his future life and fortune  After mature deliberation  he resolved to demean himself with the utmost circumspection  well knowing that every violent transport would be interpreted into an undeniable symptom of insanity  He was not without hope of being able to move his jailor by a due administration of that which is generally more efficacious than all the flowers of elocution  but when he rose in the morning  he found his pockets had been carefully examined  and emptied of all his papers and cash   The keeper entering  he inquired about these particulars  and was given to understand  that they were all safe deposited for his use  to be forthcoming at a proper season  But  at present  as he should want nothing  he had no occasion for money  The knight acquiesced in this declaration  and eat his breakfast in quiet   About eleven  he received a visit from the physician  who contemplated his looks with great solemnity  and having examined his pulse  shook his head  saying   Well  sir  how d ye do —come  don t be dejected— everything is for the best—you are in very good hands  sir  I assure you  and I dare say will refuse nothing that may be thought conducive to the recovery of your health     Doctor   said our hero   if it is not an improper question to ask  I should be glad to know your opinion of my disorder  — Oh  sir  as to that   replied the physician   your disorder is a—kind of a—sir   tis very common in this country—a sort of a —— Do you think my distemper is madness  doctor  — O Lord  sir —not absolute madness—no—not madness—you have heard  no doubt  of what is called a weakness of the nerves  sir —though that is a very inaccurate expression  for this phrase  denoting a morbid
