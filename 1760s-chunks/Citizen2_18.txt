and at intervals would bridle back  in order to inspire us with respect as well as tenderness   This ceremony lasted for some time  and had so much employed our eyes  that we had forgot all this while that the goddess was silent  We soon however began to perceive the defect  what  said we  among each other  are we to have   51 nothing but languishing airs  soft looks  and inclinations of the head  will the goddess only deign to satisfy our eyes  Upon this one of the company stepped up to present her with some fruits he had gathered by the way  She received the present  most sweetly smiling  and with one of the whitest hands in the world  but still not a word escaped her lips   I now found that my companions grew weary of their homage  they went off one by one  and resolving not to be left hehind  I offered to go in my turn  when just at the door of the temple I was called back by a female  whose name was Pride  and who seemed displeased at the behaviour of the company  Where are you hastening  said she to me with an angry air  the goddess of beauty is here  I have been to visit her  Madam  replied I  and find her more beautiful even than report had made her  And why then will you leave her  added the female  I have seen her long enough  returned I  I have got all her features by heart  Her eyes are still the same  Her nose is a very fine one  but it is still just such a nose now as it was half an hour ago  could she throw a little more mind into her face  perhaps I should be for wishing to have more of her company  What signifies  replied my female  whether she has a mind or not  has she any occasion for a mind  so formed as she is by nature  If she had a common face  indeed  there might be some reason for thinking to improve it  but when features are already perfect  every alteration would but impair them  A fine face is already at the point of perfection  and a fine lady should endeavour to keep it so  the impression it would   52 receive from thought  would but disturb its whole oeconomy   To this speech I gave no reply  but made the best of my way to the valley of the Graces  Here I found all those who before had been my companions in the region of beauty  now upon the same errand   As we entered the valley  the prospect insensibly seemed to improve  we found every thing so natural  so domestic  and pleasing  that our minds  which before were congealed in admiration  now relaxed into gaiety and good humour  We had designed to pay our respects to the presiding goddess  but she was no where to be found  One of our companions asserted  that her temple lay to the right  another  to the left  a third  insisted that it was straight before us  and a fourth  that we had left it behind  In short  we found every thing familiar and charming  but could not determine where to seek for the Grace in person   In this agreeable incertitude we passed several hours  and though very desirous of finding the goddess  by no means impatient of the delay  Every part of the valley presented some minute beauty  which without offering itself at once  stole within the soul  and captivated us with the charms of our retreat  Still  however  we continued to search  and might still have continued  had we not been interrupted by a voice which  though we could not see from whence it came  addressed us in this manner     53 If you would find the goddess of Grace  seek her not under one form  for she assumes a thousand  Ever changing under the eye of inspection  her variety  rather than her figure  is pleasing  In contemplating her beauty  the eye glides over every perfection with giddy delight  and  capable of fixing no where  is charmed with the whole   She is now Contemplation with solemn look  again Compassion with humid eye  she now sparkles with joy  soon every feature speaks distress  her looks at times invite our approach  at others repress our presumption  the goddess cannot be properly called beautiful under any one of these forms  but by combining them all  she becomes irresistibly pleasing   Adieu   LETTER LXXIV  From Lien Chi Altangi  to Fum Hoam  first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin  in China   THE Shops of London are as well furnished as those of Pekin  Those of London have a picture hung at their door  informing the passengers what they have to sell  as those at Pekin have a board to assure the buyer  that they have no intentions to cheat him   I was this morning to buy silk for a night cap  immediately upon entering the mercer s shop  the master and his two men  with wigs plaistered with   54 powder  appeared to ask my commands  They were certainly the civillest people alive
