   But the chief reason I m glad you don t set out to meet me  is the   uncertainty  for it seems I must stay another week still  and hope   certainly to go Thursday after  For poor Mrs  Jervis will go at the same   time  she says  and can t be ready before       Oh  that I was once well with you   Though he is very civil too at   present  and not so cross as he was  and yet he is as vexatious another   way  as you shall hear  For yesterday he had a rich suit of clothes   brought home  which they call a birth day suit  for he intends to go to   London against next birth day  to see the court  and our folks will have   it he is to be made a lord   I wish they may make him an honest man  as   he was always thought  but I have not found it so  alas for me       And so  as I was saying  he had these clothes come home  and he tried   them on  And before he pulled them off  he sent for me  when nobody else   was in the parlour with him  Pamela  said he  you are so neat and so   nice in your own dress   Alack a day  I didn t know I was   that you   must be a judge of ours  How are these clothes made  Do they fit me   I   am no judge  said I  and please your honour  but I think they look very   fine       His waistcoat stood on end with silver lace  and he looked very grand    But what he did last  has made me very serious  and I could make him no   compliments  Said he  Why don t you wear your usual clothes  Though I   think every thing looks well upon you  for I still continue in my new   dress   I said  I have no clothes  sir  I ought to call my own  but   these  and it is no matter what such an one as I wears  Said he  Why you   look very serious  Pamela  I see you can bear malice   Yes  so I can    sir  said I  according to the occasion  Why  said he  your eyes always   look red  I think  Are you not a fool to take my last freedom so much to   heart  I am sure you  and that fool Mrs  Jervis  frightened me  by your   hideous squalling  as much as I could frighten you  That is all we   had for it  said I  and if you could be so afraid of your own servants   knowing of your attempts upon a poor unworthy creature  that is under   your protection while I stay  surely your honour ought to be more afraid   of God Almighty  in whose presence we all stand  in every action of   our lives  and to whom the greatest  as well as the least  must be   accountable  let them think what they list       He took my hand  in a kind of good humoured mockery  and said  Well   urged  my pretty preacher  When my Lincolnshire chaplain dies  I ll   put thee on a gown and cassock  and thou lt make a good figure in   his place   I wish  said I  a little vexed at his jeer  your honour s   conscience would be your preacher  and then you would need no other   chaplain  Well  well  Pamela  said he  no more of this unfashionable   jargon  I did not send for you so much for your opinion of my new suit    as to tell you  you are welcome to stay  since Mrs  Jervis desires it    till she goes  I welcome  said I  I am sure I shall rejoice when I am   out of the house       Well  said he  you are an ungrateful baggage  but I am thinking it would   be pity  with these fair soft hands  and that lovely skin   as he called   it  and took hold of my hand   that you should return again to hard   work  as you must if you go to your father s  and so I would advise her   to take a house in London  and let lodgings to us members of parliament    when we come to town  and such a pretty daughter as you may pass for    will always fill her house  and she ll get a great deal of money       I was sadly vexed at this barbarous joke  but being ready to cry before    the tears
