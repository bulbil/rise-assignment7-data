and expressive of a disposition in    sufferably proud and overbearing  My heart  indeed  acknowledged         28 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      how very lovely he was in his person   but the superiority of his   talents  and the refinement of his manners  gave him a distinction   that was not altogether so grateful      All day I kept my apartment  in displeasure at my brother  my    self  and the world  The next morning I was informed  that the   moment he left me he went to the minister  who engaged  at his   instance  to have every grievance that he complained of redressed   to its extent   that the minister had afterwards introduced him to   his majesty in full leve e  that the king held him in long and fami    liar conversation  and that all the court was profuse of their ad    miration and praises of Mr  Clinton      This also was fresh matter of triumph to him  and mortification   to me  It was now evident that my brother s application to me   was intended merely to do me peculiar honour   and in return  said   I to myself  I have endeavoured to cover him with confusion and   disgrace  Yet  when I understood that he had disdained to men    tion me as his brother  or of his blood  I also scorned to derive   lustre from any claim of affinity with him  and I further felt   that I could not forgive him the reproaches which he constrained   me to give myself in his behalf      From that time I took great pains to dissipate or suppress those   uneasy sensations which the remembrance of him gave me  But   after I had married and retired from the glare and bustle of the   world   and more particularly on the birth of my first child  when   my heart had entered into a new sphere of domestic feelings  this   dear brother returned with double weight upon my mind  Yet   his idea was no longer accompanied by envy or resentment  but by   an affectionate and sweet  though paining  remorse      I wrote him a letter full of penitential submissions  and of tender   and atoning prayers for pardon and reconcilement  But  alas     my messenger returned with tidings that  some years past  he had   withdrawn from trade  had retired to France or Holland  had   dropped all correspondence  and that no one in England knew   whether he was dead or alive      Ah  my brother  my dear brother   I would often repeat to   myself   has any reverse of fortune happened to you  my brother    some domestic calamity  some heavy distress  perhaps  and no   brother at hand to console or share your afflictions  Return to   me  divide my heart  divide my fortune  with me and mine     Alas  wretch that I am   you know not that you have a brother    one deserving of that name  You know not that this bosom of   flint is now humanized  and melted down in the fervour of affec    tion towards you  You hate me  you despise me  my amiable   brother   How  now  shall I make you sensible that my heart is   full of your image  of esteem  of tenderest love  for my lovely   Harry Clinton       I again sent other messengers in search of intelligence  and pro    cured letters to the bankers and merchants of principal note   abroad   but all my solicitudes and inquiries were equally fruitless      The grief that this occasioned first taught me to reflect  and   cast a shade over the lustre of every object about me  The world   no more appeared as that world which  formerly  had held out         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  29     happiness to either hand  I no longer beheld it through the per    spectives of curiosity or youthful desire   I had worn out all its   gaieties   I had exhausted all its delights   for me it had nothing   more to promise or bestow   and yet I saw no better prospect    no other resource      Should I turn to religion  a little observation taught me  that   the devotees themselves were warm in pursuit of objects of which   I was tired   that they were still subject to the passions and   desires of the world   and were no way to be distinguished from   other men  save by an unsociable reserve  or gloomy cast of   countenance      May I venture to confess to you
