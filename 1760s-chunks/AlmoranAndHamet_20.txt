that   issued from the cloud  pronounced with a loud but hollow tone          Fate has decreed  to ALMORAN  ALMEIDA        At these words  ALMORAN rushed forward  and placing himself by the side   of ALMEIDA  the cloud disappeared  and he cried out   Let me now   proclaim to the world the secret  which to this moment I have hidden in   my bosom  I love ALMEIDA  The being who alone knew my love  has now by   miracle approved it  Let his decree be accomplished   He then commanded   that the ceremony should proceed  and seizing the hand of the lady    began to repeat that part of it which was to have been repeated by   HAMET  But ALMEIDA instantly drew her hand from him in an agony of   distress  and HAMET  who till then had stood motionless with amazement   and horror  started from his trance  and springing forward rushed   between them  ALMORAN turned fiercely upon him  but HAMET  who having   been warned by OMAR  knew the prodigy to be effected by some evil being   whom it was virtue to resist  laid his hand upon his scymitar  and  with   a frown of indignation and defiance  commanded him to stand off   I now   know thee   said he   as a man  and  therefore  as a brother I know thee   not        ALMORAN reflecting  that the foundation of this reproach was unknown to   all who were present  and that to them he would therefore appear to be   injured  looked round with an affected smile of wonder and compassion    as appealing to them from a charge that was thus fiercely and   injuriously brought against him  and imputing it to the violence of   sudden passions by which truth and reason were overborne  The eye of   HAMET at once detected the artifice  which he disdained to expose  he    therefore  commanded the guard that attended to carry off ALMEIDA to her   apartment  The guard was preparing to obey  when ALMORAN  who thought he   had now such an opportunity to get her into his own power as would never   return  ordered them to see her safely lodged in his own seraglio       The men  who thus received opposite commands from persons to whom they   owed equal obedience  stood still in suspense  not knowing which to   prefer  ALMORAN then reproached them with want of obedience  not to him    but to God  appealing to the prodigy for the justification of his claim    HAMET  on the contrary  repeated his order  with a look and emphasis   scarce less commanding than the thunder and the voice  But the priests   interposing in favour of ALMORAN  upon presumption that his right had   been decided by a superior power  the guard rushed between HAMET and   ALMEIDA  and with looks that expressed the utmost reluctance and regret    attempted to separate their hands  which were clasped in each other  She   was affrighted at the violence  but yet more at the apprehension of what   was to follow  she  therefore  turned her eyes upon HAMET  conjuring   him not to leave her  in a tone of tenderness and distress which it is   impossible to describe  he replied with a vehemence that was worthy of   his passion   I will not leave thee   and immediately drew his sabre  At   the same moment they forced her from him  and a party having interposed   to cover those that were carrying her off  HAMET lifted up his weapon to   force his passage through them  but was prevented by OMAR  who  having   pressed through the crowd  presented himself before him   Stop me not     said HAMET   it is for ALMEIDA    If thou wouldst save ALMEIDA   said   OMAR   and thyself  do that only which is RIGHT  What have these done   who oppose thee  more than they ought  and what end can their   destruction answer  but to stain thy hands with unavailing murder  Thou   canst only take the life of a few faithful slaves  who will not lift up   their hands against thee  thou canst not rescue ALMEIDA from thy   brother  but thou canst preserve thyself from guilt        These words of OMAR suspended the rage of HAMET  like a charm  and   returning his scymitar into its sheath   Let me then   said he   suffer    and be guiltless  It is true  that against these ranks my single arm   must be ineffectual  but if my wrongs can rouse a nation to repress the   tyranny  that will shortly extend over it the injuries that now reach   only to me  justice
