wine       When he had supped  he stood up  and said  O how happy for you it is    that you can  at will  thus make your speaking eyes overflow in this   manner  without losing any of their brilliancy  You have been told  I   suppose  that you are most beautiful in your tears   Did you ever    said he to her   who all this while was standing in one corner of the   parlour   see a more charming creature than this  Is it to be wondered   at  that I demean myself thus to take notice of her   See  said he  and   took the glass with one hand  and turned me round with the other  what   a shape  what a neck  what a hand  and what a bloom on that lovely   face   But who can describe the tricks and artifices  that lie lurking   in her little  plotting  guileful heart   Tis no wonder the poor parson   was infatuated with her   I blame him less than I do her  for who could   expect such artifice in so young a sorceress       I went to the farther part of the room  and held my face against the   wainscot  and in spite of all I could do to refrain crying  sobbed as   if my heart would break  He said  I am surprised  Mrs  Jewkes  at the   mistake of the letters you tell me of  But  you see  I am not afraid any   body should read what I write  I don t carry on private correspondences    and reveal every secret that comes to my knowledge  and then corrupt   people to carry my letters against their duty  and all good conscience       Come hither  hussy  said he  You and I have a dreadful reckoning to   make  Why don t you come  when I bid you   Fie upon it  Mrs  Pamela    said she  What  not stir  when his honour commands you to come to   him   Who knows but his goodness will forgive you       He came to me   for I had no power to stir   and put his arms about my   neck  and would kiss me  and said  Well  Mrs  Jewkes  if it were not for   the thought of this cursed parson  I believe in my heart  so great is my   weakness  that I could not forgive this intriguing little slut  and take   her to my bosom       O  said the sycophant  you are very good  sir  very forgiving    indeed   But come  added the profligate wretch  I hope you will be so   good  as to take her to your bosom  and that  by to morrow morning    you ll bring her to a better sense of her duty       Could any thing in womanhood be so vile  I had no patience  but yet   grief and indignation choaked up the passage of my words  and I could   only stammer out a passionate exclamation to Heaven  to protect my   innocence  But the word was the subject of their ridicule  Was ever poor   creature worse beset       He said  as if he had been considering whether he could forgive me   or not  No  I cannot yet forgive her neither   She has given me great   disturbance  has brought great discredit upon me  both abroad and at   home  has corrupted all my servants at the other house  has despised my   honourable views and intentions to her  and sought to run away with this   ungrateful parson   And surely I ought not to forgive all this   Yet    with all this wretched grimace  he kissed me again  and would have put   his hand into my bosom  but I struggled  and said  I would die before I   would be used thus   Consider  Pamela  said he  in a threatening tone    consider where you are  and don t play the fool  If you do  a more   dreadful fate awaits you than you expect  But take her up stairs  Mrs    Jewkes  and I ll send a few lines to her to consider of  and let me have   your answer  Pamela  in the morning   Till then you have to resolve  and   after that your doom is fixed   So I went up stairs  and gave myself up   to grief  and expectation of what he would send  but yet I was glad of   this night s reprieve       He sent me  however  nothing at all  And about twelve o clock  Mrs
