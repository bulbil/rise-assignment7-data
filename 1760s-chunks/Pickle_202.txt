 ingratiated himself with the uncle  Peregrine took his leave  and next  day  in the forenoon  visited the niece in his chariot  after she  had been admonished by her kinsman to behave with circumspection  and  cautioned against neglecting or discouraging the addresses of such a  valuable admirer   CHAPTER LXXV   He prosecutes his Design upon Emilia with great Art and Perseverance   Our adventurer  having by his hypocrisy obtained free access to his  mistress  began the siege by professing the most sincere contrition  for his former levity  and imploring her forgiveness with such earnest  supplication  that  guarded as she was against his flattering arts  she  began to believe his protestations  which were even accompanied with  tears  and abated a good deal of that severity and distance she had  proposed to maintain during this interview  She would not  however   favour him with the least acknowledgment of a mutual passion  because   in the midst of his vows of eternal constancy and truth  he did not  mention one syllable of wedlock  though he was now entirely master of  his own conduct  and this consideration created a doubt  which fortified  her against all his attacks  Yet  what her discretion would have  concealed  was discovered by her eyes  which  in spite of all her  endeavours  breathed forth complacency and love  for her inclination  was flattered by her own self sufficiency  which imputed her admirer s  silence in that particular to the hurry and perturbation of his spirits   and persuaded her that he could not possibly regard her with any other  than honourable intentions   The insidious lover exulted in the tenderness of her looks  from which  he presaged a complete victory  but  that he might not overshoot  himself by his own precipitation  he would not run the risk of declaring  himself  until her heart should be so far entangled within his snares   as that neither the suggestions of honour  prudence  nor pride  should  be able to disengage it  Armed with this resolution  he restrained  the impatience of his temper within the limits of the most delicate  deportment  After having solicited and obtained permission to attend  her to the next opera  he took her by the hand  and  pressing it to his  lips  in the most respectful manner  went away  leaving her in a most  whimsical state of suspense  chequered with an interesting vicissitude  of hope and fear  On the appointed day  he appeared again about five  o clock in the afternoon  and found her native charms so much improved  by the advantages of dress  that he was transported with admiration    6 22 15  3 45 PM   and delight  and  while he conducted her to the Haymarket  could scarce  bridle the impetuosity of his passion  so as to observe the forbearing  maxims he had adopted  When she entered the pit  he had abundance of  food for the gratification of his vanity  for  in a moment  she eclipsed  all the female part of the audience  each individual allowing in her own  heart that the stranger was by far the handsomest woman there present   except herself   Here it was that our hero enjoyed a double triumph  he was vain of this  opportunity to enhance his reputation for gallantry among the ladies of  fashion who knew him  and proud of an occasion to display his quality  acquaintance to Emilia  that she might entertain the greater idea of the  conquest she had made  and pay the more deference to his importance in  the sequel of his addresses  That he might profit as much as possible  by this situation  he went up and accosted every person in the pit   with whom he ever had least communication  whispered and laughed with an  affected air of familiarity  and even bowed at a distance to some of the  nobility  on the slender foundation of having stood near them at court   or presented them with a pinch of rappee at White s chocolate house   This ridiculous ostentation  though now practised with a view of  promoting his design  was a weakness that  in some degree  infected  the whole of his behaviour  for nothing gave him so much joy in  conversation  as an opportunity of giving the company to understand how  well he was with persons of distinguished rank and character  He would  often  for example  observe  as it were occasionally  that the Duke of  G   was one of the best natured men in the world  and illustrate this  assertion by some instance of his affability  in which he himself was  concerned  Then  by an abrupt transition  he would repeat some repartee  of Lady T    and mention a certain bon mot of the Earl of C    which was  uttered in his hearing   Abundance of young men in this manner make free with the names  though  they have never had access to the persons of the nobility  but this was  not the case with Peregrine  who  in consideration of his appearance and  supposed
