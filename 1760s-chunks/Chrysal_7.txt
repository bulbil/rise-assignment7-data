 visiting   the battlefields of Frederick the Great and Ferdinand of   Brunswick  victor of Minden   being opportunely present at   most of the important sea fights  and witnessing the military   movements against the French in Canada  The incompetence    treachery  and cowardice of king s officers are everywhere   the theme   the charges are corroborated by narratives   supposed to be by an eye witness   and the guilty are por    trayed with personal touches that the man in the street   recognized without a moment s hesitation  Chiysal sees   everything as Johnstone wants it to be seen  He was a fervent   admirer of Pitt and the war policy   and so  when the guinea   gets into the purse of Frederick of Prussia  it finds him to be    not only a heaven born general  fighting the battles of the   Lord and of Protestantism  but a high souled ascetic  who   sets his people a shining example of jjiety  humility  and   virtue  The guinea is also an anti Semite  at a time when         iv INTRODUCTION     hatred of tte Jews was inveterate all Europe over   and it has   the good fortune to be present at a celebration of the Feast   of the Passover  when the Jews are represented as ofEering   up a Christian child as Paschal lamb      This sort of thing is merely ridiculous   but there is one   ofEence of Johnstone s that cannot be forgiven  his ribald   attack upon Whitefield  In this  as in many other cases    he was voicing a large section of public opinion  as can easily   be verified by a glance at such contemporary works as Graves s   Spiritual Quixote and Smollett s Hum phry Clinker  not to   mention Foote s scurrilous  but very amusing farce  The Minor    Johnstone surpasses even the last named in the impudence   and the grossness of his slander  and more still in the directness   of its personality   Not content with adopting all the stupid   innuendoes which the vulgar sinner loves to hurl at the un    selfish zealot  he invents  or adopts without any attempt to   sift  a lying but circumstantial account of Whitefield s birth   and upbringing  and of his complicity with thieves and worse    that must have convinced ignorant readers that the saint was   a hypocritical rogue  It is hard to suppose that an intelligent   man like Johnstone swallowed all these monstrous fictions   himself  His extravagance proves him a jaundiced and un    trustworthy witness  a man who when he chose played un    scrupulously to the mob  His book is a historical document   only in the sense that it is a picture of public opinion at the   time   still  public opinion is an important factor in the making   of history  A man with the journahstic art of relating as fact   the things he wants believed  with very little conscience    and an intimate and minute acquaintance with the backstairs   chronicles of the period  Johnstone produced  in spite of his   excesses  or by reason of them  one of the most damaging in    dictments of the public men he hated that was ever used in   political warfare  While he remains the best or the only   authority on such matters as the antics of the Medmenham   bufioons  and a few other dark doings  most of his statements   require the same discount as the future historian may be   expected to apply to the views of personal conduct and private   motive vouchsafed by the more prurient and sensational   newspapers of the present day      Half at least of the satire is directed against systematic   corruption in high places  Sandwich and Fox  the first Lord   Holland  are pilloried as examples of peculation on a truly   colossal scale   and George the Second s mistress  the Countess   of Yarmouth  is exhibited as a glaring illustration of how vast   Bums were made by the sale of offices and titles  Ireland  she   boasts  has been her privy purse for many years  appointments         INTRODUCTION xv     in that blissful country requiring from candidates no qualifica    tions whatever beyond the ability to pay her fee    An Irish   title is the constant refuge of those sons of fortune who  not   being born in the rank of gentlemen  or having forfeited it   by their villainies  are desirous of changing their names for   sonorous titles  to hide their disgrace  as it were  under a heap   of honours    City employments  however  even though of   an inferior kind  were the most productive of blackmail      Her Grace   keeps a Ust of all the
