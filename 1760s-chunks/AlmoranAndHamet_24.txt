that he had been wretched only because he had been weak  and   that to multiply and not to suppress his wishes was the way to acquire   felicity       As he was returning from the gallery  he was met by Osmyn and Caled  who   had heard the supernatural declaration in his behalf  and learned its   effects  ALMORAN  in that hasty flow of unbounded but capricious favour    which  in contracted minds  is the effect only of unexpected good   fortune  raised Osmyn from his feet to his bosom   As in the trial     said he   thou hast been faithful  I now invest thee with a superior   trust  The toils of state shall from this moment devolve upon thee  and   from this moment  the delights of empire unallayed shall be mine  I will   recline at ease  remote from every eye but those that reflect my own   felicity  the felicity that I shall taste in secret  surrounded by the   smiles of beauty  and the gaities of youth  Like heaven  I will reign   unseen  and like heaven  though unseen  I will be adored   Osmyn   received this delegation of power with a tumultuous pleasure  that was   expressed only by silence and confusion  ALMORAN remarked it  and   exulting in the pride of power  he suddenly changed his aspect  and   regarding Osmyn  who was yet blushing  and whose eyes were swimming in   tears of gratitude  with a stern and ardent countenance   Let me    however   said he   warn thee to be watchful in thy trust  beware  that   no rude commotion violate my peace by thy fault  lest my anger sweep   thee in a moment to destruction   He then directed his eye to Caled     And thou too   said he   hast been faithful  be thou next in honour and   in power to Osmyn  Guard both of you my paradise from dread and care    fulfill the duty that I have assigned you  and live        He was then informed by a messenger  that HAMET had escaped  and that   OMAR was taken  As he now despised the power both of HAMET and OMAR  he   expressed neither concern nor anger that HAMET had fled  but he ordered   OMAR to be brought before him       When OMAR appeared bound and disarmed  he regarded him with a smile of   insult and derision  and asked him  what he had now to hope   I have    indeed   said OMAR   much less to hope  than thou hast to fear    Thy   insolence   said ALMORAN   is equal to thy folly  what power on earth is   there  that I should fear    Thy own   said OMAR   I have not leisure   now   replied ALMORAN   to hear the paradoxes of thy philosophy   explained  but to shew thee  that I fear not thy power  thou shalt live    I will leave thee to hopeless regret  to wiles that have been scorned   and defeated  to the unheeded petulance of dotage  to the fondness that   is repayed with neglect  to restless wishes  to credulous hopes  and to   derided command  to the slow and complicated torture of despised old   age  and that  when thou shalt long have abhorred thy being  shall   destroy it    The misery   said OMAR   which thou hast menaced  it is   not in thy power to inflict  As thou hast taken from me all that I   possessed by the bounty of thy father  it is true that I am poor  it is   true also  that my knees are now feeble  and bend with the weight of   years that is upon me  I am  as thou art  a man  and therefore I have   erred  but I have still kept the narrow path in view with a faithful   vigilance  and to that I have soon returned  the past  therefore  I do   not regret  and the future I have no cause to fear  In Him who is most   merciful  I have hope  and in that hope even how I rejoice before thee    My portion in the present hour  is adversity  but I receive it  not only   with humility  but thankfulness  for I know  that whatever is ordained   is best        ALMORAN  in whose heart there were no traces of OMAR S virtue  and   therefore no foundation for his confidence  sustained himself against   their force  by treating them as hypocrisy and affectation   I know     says he   that thou hast long learned to eccho the specious and pompous   sounds  by
