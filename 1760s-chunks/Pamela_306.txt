with three guineas worth of good books  such as   a family bible  a common prayer  a whole duty of man  or any other you   think will be acceptable  for they live a great way from church  and in   winter the ways from their farm thither are impassable       He has brought me my papers safe  and I will send them to Lady Davers   the first opportunity  down to the place I mentioned in my last       My dear Mr  B     just now tells me  that he will carry me  in the   morning  a little airing  about ten miles off  in his chariot and four    to breakfast at a farm house  noted for a fine dairy  and where  now and   then  the neighbouring gentry  of both sexes  resort for that purpose          Thursday       We set out at about half an hour after six  accordingly  and driving   pretty smartly  got at this truly neat house at half an hour after   eight  and I was much pleased with the neatness of the good woman  and   her daughter and maid  and he was so good as to say he would now and   then take a turn with me to the same place  and on the same occasion  as   I seemed to like it  for that it would be a pretty exercise  and procure   us appetites to our breakfasts  as well as our return would to our   dinners  But I find this was not  though a very good reason  the only   one for which he gave me this agreeable airing  as I shall acquaint you       We were prettily received and entertained here  and an elegancy ran   through every thing  persons as well as furniture  yet all plain  And my   master said to the good housewife  Do your young boarding school ladies   still at times continue their visits to you  Mrs  Dobson  Yes  sir  said   she  I expect three or four of them every minute       There is  my dear  said he  within three miles of this farm  a very good   boarding school for ladies  The governess of it keeps a chaise and pair    which is to be made a double chaise at pleasure  and in summer time    when the misses perform their tasks to satisfaction  she favours them   with an airing to this place  three or four at a time  and after they   have breakfasted  they are carried back  And this serves both for a   reward  and for exercise  and the misses who have this favour are not   a little proud of it  and it brings them forward in their respective   tasks       A very good method  sir  said I  And just as we were talking  the chaise   came in with four misses  all pretty much of a size  and a maid servant   to attend them  They were shewn another little neat apartment  that went   through ours  and made their honours very prettily  as they passed by   us  I went into the room to them  and asked them questions about their   work  and their lessons  and what they had done to deserve such a fine   airing and breakfasting  and they all answered me very prettily  And   pray  little ladies  said I  what may I call your names  One was called   Miss Burdoff  one Miss Nugent  one Miss Booth  and the fourth Miss   Goodwin  I don t know which  said I  is the prettiest  but you are all   best  my little dears  and you have a very good governess  to indulge   you with such a fine airing  and such delicate cream  and bread and   butter  I hope you think so too       My master came in  and I had no mistrust in the world  and he kissed   each of them  but looked more wishfully on Miss Goodwin  than on any of   the others  but I thought nothing just then  Had she been called Miss   Godfrey  I had hit upon it in a trice       When we went from them  he said  Which do you think the prettiest of   those misses  Really  sir  replied I  it is hard to say  Miss Booth is a   pretty brown girl  and has a fine eye  Miss Burdoff has a great deal   of sweetness in her countenance  but is not so regularly featured  Miss   Nugent is very fair  and Miss Goodwin has a fine black eye  and is    besides  I think  the genteelest shaped child  but they are all pretty
