formerly  I must depart to morrow morning early  I have already taken leave of several of my friends here  I have some to make my compliments to at Rome  which I reserved for my return     367 You stay with me to night   I intend it  my Lord   Well  we will return to company  Imust make my excuses to my friends  Your departure to morrow must be one  They all admire you  They are acquainted with your character  They will join with me to engage you  if possible  to stay longer   We returned to the company   LETTER XXXII  Miss BYRON  To Miss SELBY   REceive now  my dear  the doctor s thirteenth Letter  and the last he intends to favour us with  till he entertains us with the histories of Mrs  Beaumont  and Lady Olivia   Dr  Bartlett s thirteenth Letter   MR  Grandison set out next morning  The General s behaviour to him at his departure  was much more open and free than it was at receiving him   Mr  Grandison  on his return to Florence  entered into the affairs of his late friend Mr  Jervois  with the spirit  and yet with the temper  for which he is noted  when he engages in any business  He put every thing in a happy train in fewer days than it would have cost some other persons months  for he was present himself on every occasion  and in every business  where his presence would accelerate it  Yet he had embarrassments from Olivia   He found  before he set out for Naples  that Mrs  Beaumont  at the earnest request of the Marchioness  was gone to Bologna  At his return  not hearing any thing from Signor Jeronymo  he wrote to Mrs  Beaumont  requesting her to inform him of the state of things in that family  as far as she thought proper    368 and  particularly  of the health of that dear friend  on whose silence to three Letters he had written  he had the most melancholy apprehensions  He let that Lady know  that he should set out in a very few days for Paris  if he had no probability of being of service to the family she favoured with her company   To this Letter Mrs  Beaumont returned the following answer   SIR   I Have the favour of yours  We are very miserable here  The servants are forbidden to answer any enquiries  but generally  and that not truly   Your friend  Signor Jeronymo  has gone through a severe operation  He has been given over  but hopes are now entertained  not of his absolute recovery  but that he will be no worse than he was before the necessity for the operation arose  Poor man  He forgot not  however  his sister and you  when he was out of the power of the opiates that were adminstred to him   On my coming hither  I found Lady Clementina in a deplorable way  Sometimes raving  sometimes gloomy  and in bonds—Twice had she given them apprehensions of fatal attempts  They therefore confined her hands   They have been excessively wrong in their management of her  Now soothing  now severe  observing no method   She was extremely earnest to see you before you lest Bologna  On her knees repeatedly she besought this favour  and promised to be easy if they would comply  but they imagined that their compliance would aggravate the symptoms   I very freely blamed them for not complying  at the time when she was so desirous of seeing you  I told them  that soothing her would probably then have done good     369 When they knew you were actually gone from Bologna  they told her so  Camilla shocked me with the description of her rage and despair  on the communication  This was followed by fits of silence  and the deepest melancholy   They had hopes  on my arrival  that my company would have been of service to her  But for two days together she regarded me not  nor any thing I could say to her  On the third of my arrival  finding her confinement extremely uneasy to her  I prevailed  but with great difficulty  to have her restored to the use of her hands  and to be allowed to walk with me in the garden  They had hinted to me their apprehensions about a piece of water   Her woman being near us  if there had been occasion for assistance  I insensibly led that way  She sat down on a seat over against the great cascade  but she made no motion that gave me apprehensions  From this time she has been fonder of me than before  The day I obtained this liberty for her  she often clasped her arms about me  and laid her face in my bosom  and I could plainly see  it was in gratitude for restoring to her the use of her arms  But she cared not to speak   Indeed she generally affects deep silence  Yet  at times  I see her very soul is fretted  She moves to one place  is tired of that  shifts to another  and another  all round the
