I have is yours   and if you   had brought a whole regiment of poor little Neddies with you    they should be all welcome to me  for your sake  my Harry      Then Harry sprung up and caught his patron about the neck    so that it was some time before the old gentleman could get loose    But Harry  says he  I am going just now to leave this country     will you and your man Neddy come along with me  Over the   world wide  dada  says Harry  but where are you going  sir    I am going a begging  Harry  O that will be brave sport  says   Harry  I will tell you what you shall do  dada   What s that  my   love  Why  sir  says Harry  you must get a great bag  like the   old man and little child that was at door t other day   and Neddy   and I will beg for you  sir   and we will put all that we get into   your great bag  as that good little child did for his daddy  without   touching a bit   though he was hungry enough himself  poor fellow    I warrant  But don t let us go to beg to papa s door  sir   for if   you do  they will box and beat us  and drive us away  as they did   to poor little Neddy to day  sir      The old gentleman  thereat  had his countenance divided betwixt   the rising tear and the bursting laugh  But  taking Harry by the   hand  he said No  no  my heavenly creature  I am not going to   beg of any man living  but to beg of God to pour down his full   weight of blessings upon my Harry  and to endeavour to confirm   them to him  both here and hereafter  by my care and instructions      Having thus spoken  he put a large cake into the hand of each   of the children  and causing them to drink a full glass of small   white wine  he took them into a back yard  where a light coach   with six horses  and three servants ready mounted  attended   and   having placed his young companions  and seated himself between   them  away the coach drove at a sweeping gallop      About the time that our hero and his patron set out  nurse went   up stairs with a most bountiful cut of home baked bread and butter    for the amusement of the young caitiff whom she had left in the   closet   but not finding him there  she hastily dropped her pro    vender on the first window she met  and  hurrying down to the     E         50 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      kitchen  earnestly inquired for the little beggar boy whom Master   Harry had taken into his service  At this question all the servants   stood in silent amazement except Susy  who bridling up  and as    suming the whole importance of her station Why  nurse  sa    you must not oppose that I am come here to sweep and to clean   after lousy little flagrants  it was enough to breed an antacrion    that it was  hi the house   so what magnifies many words  I took   the little dirty brat  and cuflTd him out of doors  You did  hussy    says nurse   you dare to affront and vex my child my little man   the honour and pride of all the family  And so saying  she ups   with her brawny arm  and gave Susy such a douse on the side of   the head  as left her fast asleep for an hour and upward  Then    running up stairs again  she went searching and clamouring for   Harry about the house  in order to comfort and condole with him   for his loss      Dinner was now served up  and the company seated  and all the   servants ran severally here and there  repeatedly summoning Master   Harry to attend   but Harry was out of hearing by many a mile    When the cloth was removed  nurse entered with an aspect  half   in tears and half distracted  and exclaimed that her child was not   to be found  And what  nurse  says the earl  do you think is be    come of him   I hope  my lord  says she  that he is either strayed   to his daddy or to the dumb gentleman s  Then messengers were   instantly despatched to both houses  who speedily returned with   tidings that Master Harry had not been seen at his foster father s
