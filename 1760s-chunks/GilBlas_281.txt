is of the same blind family with fortune  It shall be my lot to teach you  replied he with insulting scorn  that I have unsealed the eyes of both   At this proud defiance  we both dismounted  tied our horses to a tree  and engaged with equal fury  I must candidly acknowledge the prowess of my antagonist  who was a consummate master of fencing  My life was exposed to the greatest possible danger  Nevertheless  as the strong is often vanquished by the weak  my rival  in spite of all his science  received a thrust through the heart  and fell a lifeless corpse   I immediately returned  and told a confidential servant what had happened  requesting him to take horse and acquaint my aunt  before the officers of justice could get intelligence of the event  He was also to obtain from her a supply of money and jewels  and then join me at the first inn as you enter Plazencia   All this was performed within three hours  Donna Eleonora rather triumphed than mourned over a catastrophe  which restored my injured honour  and sent me large remittances for my travels abroad  till the affair had blown over   Not to dwell on indifferent circumstances  suffice it to say  that I embarked for Italy  and equipped myself so as to make a respectable figure at the several courts   While I was endeavouring to beguile the weary hours of absence  Helena was weeping at home from the same cause  Instead of joining in the family resentment  her heart was panting for a compromise  and for my speedy return  Six months had already elapsed  and I firmly believe that her constancy would have been proof against the track of time  had time been seconded by no more powerful ally  Don Blas de Combados  a gentleman from the western coast of Galicia  came to Coria  to take possession of a rich inheritance unsuccessfully contested by a near relation  He liked that country so much better than his own  that he made it his principal residence  Combados was a personable man  His manners were gentle and well bred  his conversation most insinuating  With such a passport  he soon got into the best company  and knew all the family concerns of the place   It was not long before he heard of Don George s daughter  and of her extraordinary beauty  This touched his curiosity nearly  he was eager to behold so formidable a lady  For this purpose  he endeavoured to worm himself into the good graces of her father  and succeeded so well  that the old gentleman  already looking on him as a son in law  gave him free admission to the house  and the liberty of conversing with Donna Helena in his presence  The Galician soon became deeply enamoured of her  indeed  it was the common fate of all who had ever beheld her charms  He opened his heart to Don George  who consented to his paying his addresses  but told him that so far from offering violence to her inclination  he should never interfere in her choice  Hereupon Don Blas pressed every device that impassioned ingenuity could suggest into his service  to melt and warm the icicles of reserve  but the lady was impenetrable to his arts  fast bound in the fetters of an earlier love  Felicia  however  was in the new suitor s interest  convinced of his merit by the universal argument  All the faculties of her soul were called forth in his cause  On the other hand  the father urged his wishes and entreaties  Thus was Donna Helena tormented for a whole year with their importunities  and yet her faith continued unshaken   Combados finding that Don George and Felicia took up his cause with very little success  proposed an expedient for conquering prejudice to the following effect  We will suppose a merchant of Coria to have received a letter from his Italian correspondent  in which  among the news of the day  there shall be the following paragraph   A Spanish gentleman  Don Gaston de Cogollos  has lately arrived at the court of Parma  He is said to he nephew and sole heir to a rich widow of Coria  He is paying his addresses to a nobleman s daughter  but the family wishes to ascertain the validity of his pretensions  Send me word  therefore  whether you know this Don Gaston  together with the amount of his aunt s fortune  On your answer the marriage will depend  Parma  day of   The old gentleman considered this trick as a mere ebullition of humour  a lawful stratagem of amorous warfare  and the jade of a go between  with conscience still more callous than her master s  was delighted with the probability of the manoeuvre  It seemed to be so much the more happily imagined  as they knew Helena to be a proud girl  capable of taking decisive measures  in the moment of surprise and indignation  Don George undertook to be the herald of my fickleness  and by way of colouring the contrivance more naturally  to confront the pretended correspondent with her  This project was executed as soon as formed  The father  with counterfeit emotions of displeasure  said to Donna Helena  Daughter  it is not enough now to tell you that our relations inveigh against
