look more like a showman or a conjurer  —Ferret  nettled at this address  answered   It would be well for you  that I could conjure a little common sense into that numskull of yours    If I want that commodity   rejoined the squire   I must go to another market  I trow —You legerdemain men be more like to conjure the money from our pockets than sense into our skulls  Vor my own part  I was once cheated of vorty good shillings by one of your broother cups and balls   In all probability he would have descended to particulars  had he not been seized with a return of his nausea  which obliged him to call for a bumper of brandy  This remedy being swallowed  the tumult in his stomach subsided  He desired he might be put to bed without delay  and that half a dozen eggs and a pound of bacon might  in a couple of hours  be dressed for his supper   He was accordingly led off the scene by the landlady and her daughter  and Mr  Ferret had just time to observe the fellow was a composition  in which he did not know whether knave or fool most predominated  when the master returned from the stable  He had taken off his helmet  and now displayed a very engaging countenance  His age did not seem to exceed thirty  He was tall  and seemingly robust  his face long and oval  his nose aquiline  his mouth furnished with a set of elegant teeth  white as the drifted snow  his complexion clear  and his aspect noble  His chestnut hair loosely flowed in short natural curls  and his grey eyes shone with such vivacity  as plainly showed that his reason was a little discomposed  Such an appearance prepossessed the greater part of the company in his favour  He bowed round with the most polite and affable address  inquired about his squire  and  being informed of the pains Mr  Fillet had taken for his recovery  insisted upon that gentleman s accepting a handsome gratuity  Then  in consideration of the cold bath he had undergone  he was prevailed upon to take the post of honour  namely  the great chair fronting the fire  which was reinforced with a billet of wood for his comfort and convenience   Perceiving his fellow travellers  either overawed into silence by his presence  or struck dumb with admiration at his equipage  he accosted them in these words  while an agreeable smile dimpled on his cheek —   The good company wonders  no doubt  to see a man cased in armour  such as hath been for above a whole century disused in this and every other country of Europe  and perhaps they will be still more surprised  when they hear that man profess himself a novitiate of that military order  which hath of old been distinguished in Great Britain  as well as through all Christendom  by the name of knights errant  Yes  gentlemen  in that painful and thorny path of toil and danger I have begun my career  a candidate for honest fame  determined  as far as in me lies  to honour and assert the efforts of virtue  to combat vice in all her forms  redress injuries  chastise oppression  protect the helpless and forlorn  relieve the indigent  exert my best endeavours in the cause of innocence and beauty  and dedicate my talents  such as they are  to the service of my country     What   said Ferret   you set up for a modern Don Quixote  The scheme is rather too stale and extravagant  What was a humorous romance and well timed satire in Spain near two hundred years ago  will make but a sorry jest  and appear equally insipid and absurd when really acted from affectation  at this time of day  in a country like England    The knight  eyeing this censor with a look of disdain  replied  in a solemn  lofty tone   He that from affectation imitates the extravagancies recorded of Don Quixote  is an impostor equally wicked and contemptible  He that counterfeits madness  unless he dissembles  like the elder Brutus  for some virtuous purpose  not only debases his own soul  but acts as a traitor to Heaven  by denying the divinity that is within him  I am neither an affected imitator of Don Quixote  nor  as I trust in Heaven  visited by that spirit of lunacy so admirably displayed in the fictitious character exhibited by the inimitable Cervantes  I have not yet encountered a windmill for a giant  nor mistaken this public house for a magnificent castle  neither do I believe this gentleman to be the constable  nor that worthy practitioner to be Master Elizabat  the surgeon recorded in Amadis de Gaul  nor you to be the enchanter Alquife  nor any other sage of history or romance  I see and distinguish objects as they are discerned and described by other men  I reason without prejudice  can endure contradiction  and  as the company perceives  even bear impertinent censure without passion or resentment  I quarrel with none but the foes of virtue and decorum  against whom I have declared perpetual war  and them I will everywhere attack as the natural enemies of mankind     But that
