strolling alone about his house one unhappy   evening when he had no company to divert his thoughts  he hap    pened  just as it grew dark  to overhear two persons  a male and a   female  in earnest conversation  Curiosity prompting him to   listen  he soon discovered that love was the subject of their dis    course  in which the man  whom  by his voice  he knew to be one of   his huntsman s helpers  was so successful  that he persuaded the fair   one to promise him a meeting half an hour after in the dog kennel        Though the place of assignation might have deterred any person   whose senses  as well as his inclinations  were not totally debauched    from attempting to supplant the happy lover  the novelty of such   an adventure made his lordship overlook that  and resolve to   supply his dog boy s place  Accordingly  he retired  unperceived    and going to the stables  ordered him to be called  and sent him   directly on a message some miles off  without giving him an oppor    tunity of letting his mistress know anything of the matter  As   soon as the time appointed drew near  his lordship went to the   agreeable scene  where the punctual fair one did not let him wait   long  As he was about the dog boy s size  and the place was quite   dark  she never perceived the change put upon her  but lavished   her caresses upon him with the greatest tenderness  vowing never   more to have any correspondence with the pantry boy or scullion    who  it seems  were the dog boy s formidable rivals  but to be always   constant to him alone  and took her leave of him  with a promise to   meet him there at the same time next evening        Disgusting as every circumstance of this afiair should have been    the oddity of it  with the pleasure of supplanting another  even so   mean a person  and in so unworthy an object  made him determine   to be punctual to her appointment  But then the difficulty was   how to prevent his rival s traversing his design  for his delicacy was   not in the least alarmed at the thoughts of his participating in her   favours  He was also at a loss to know who the obliging female   might be  for the darkness that concealed him was equally favourable   to her  and he was a stranger to her voice   nor did he care to ask   any questions  as that would betray his own imposture  and bring   on an explanation that he did not desire  both as his greatest plea    sure was in the cheat  and the discovery might be attended with   circumstances he should choose to avoid  in case the female was   disagreeable to him        To obviate all these inconveniences  he ordered his rival to   attend him the moment he returned  when he gave him a letter to         264 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     carry that instant to a gentleman who lived about twenty miles   off  with directions to be back early the next day with an answer    This he said aloud  in hearing of all his servants  that  if his mistress   should happen to hear of her lover s being sent from home  she   might also have reason to expect his return time enough to keep   the appointment   but to prevent this he had desired the person   to whom he wrote to keep the messenger  as if for an answer for the   letter  two or three days  in which time he concluded he himself   should be tired of his amour          CHAPTER XXXIII     CONTINTJED   HIS LOEDSHIP S SCHEME TO FLINO HIS RIVAL TJN    LTJCKXLY DISAPPOINTED â€” A DISAGBEEABLE MEETING OCCASIONS   STRANGE DISCOVEBIES â€” WOMEN NEVER AT A LOSS â€” LAW OFTEN   SPOILS SPORT       Pleased with the sagacity of this scheme  he waited for the next   evening with an impatience that he did not often feel on such occa    sions   but an unlucky accident disappointed his designs  The   gentleman to whom he wrote the letter happened not to be at home    nor was expected for a day or two  wherefore  as his lord had ordered   him to make haste back  he left the letter  and returned without   any delay  perhaps not more in obedience to his orders than from   hia impatience to retrieve the disappointment his desires had met   by his absence the evening before  As soon as he alighted  there    fore  his first care was to find out his mistress  to tell her the reason
