serious  Good Heaven  thought I   Miss  Gr  Pity me —Nay  then—But  pray  Sir  your charge   Sir Ch  The matter is too serious to be spoken of in metaphor     257Miss Gr  Good God —Hem —and twice more she hemm d—Pray  Sir  begin  Begin while I have breath   Lord and Lady L  and Dr  Bartlett  and I look d very grave  and Miss Grandison look d  in general  fretfully humble  if I may so express myself  And every thing being removed  but the table  she play d with her diamond ring  sometimes pulling it off  and putting it on  sometimes putting the tip of her finger in it  as it lay upon the table  and turning it round and round  swister or slower  and stopping thro  downcast vexation  or earnest attention  as she found herself more or less affected—What a sweet confusion   Sir Ch  You know  my dear Charlotte  that I very early after my arrival  enquired after the state of your heart  You told me it was absolutely free   Miss Gr  Well Sir   Sir Ch  Not satisfied with your own acknowledgement  as I knew that young Ladies  I know not why  when proper persons make enquiries  and for motives not ungenerous  are too apt to make secrets of a passion that is not in itself illaudable  I asked your elder sister  who scrupled not to own hers  whether there was any one man  whom you preferred to another —She assured me  that she knew not of any one   Lady L  My sister knows that I said truth   Miss Gr  Well  well  Lady L  nobody doubts your veracity   Sir Ch  Dear Charlotte  keep your temper   Miss Gr  Pray  Sir  proceed—And the ring turn d round very fast   Sir Ch  On several occasions I put the same question  and had the same assurances  My reason for repeating my question  was owing to an early intelligence—Of which more by and by   Miss Gr  Sir     258Sir Ch  And that I might either provide the money that I thought due to her as my sister  or take time to pay it  according to the circumstances of her engagement  and take from her all apprehensions of controul  in a case that might affect the happiness of her life—These  and brotherly Love  were the motives of my enquiry   Miss Gr  Your generosity  Sir  was without example   Sir Ch  Not so  I hope  My sisters had an equitable  if not a legal right to what has been done  I found  on looking into my affairs  that  by a moderate calculation of the family circumstances  no man should think of addressing a daughter of Sir Thomas Grandison  without supposing himself intitled  either by his merits or fortune  to expect 10 000 l  with her—And this  even allowing to the Son the customary preferences given to men as men  tho  given for the sake of pride  perhaps  rather than natural justice  For does not tyrant custom make a daughter change her name in marriage  and give to a son  for the sake of name only  the estate of the common ancestor of both   This generous hint  affected me  It was nearly my own case  you know  I might otherwise have been a rich heiress  and might have had as strong pretensions to be distinguished by the Grandisons for my fortune  as any Lady S  in the kingdom  But worthless as those are  to whom  for the sake of the name  my father s estate is passed  I never grudged it to them till I came acquainted with these Grandisons   Lord L  But who  Sir Charles  but you—  Sir Ch  Pray  my Lord  let not your generosity mislead you to think that a favour  which is but a due  We shall not be judged by comparison  The Laws of Truth and Justice are always the same  What others would not have done in the like situation  that let   259 them look to  But what is the mortal man  who should make an unjust advantage of mortality   Miss Grandison pulled out her handkerchief  put it to her eyes  and then in her lap  and putting half on  and half off  by turns  her ring  looked now and then at me  as if she wished me to pity her   Indeed  Lucy  I did pity her  Every one did  and so did her judge  I dare say  in his heart  But justice  my Lucy  is a severe thing  Who can bear a tryal  if the integrity and greatness of this man s heart is to be the rule  by which their actions are to be examined  Yet you shall hear how generous he was   Sir Ch  Allow me  for Miss Byron s sake  who has been but lately restored to our family  to be a little more particular  than otherwise I need to be  I had not been long in
