Horatio  said he  I am indebted to you   for my life  and would willingly make what recompence is in my power for   the obligation I have to you   think therefore what I can do for you    and if your demands exceed not what is fit for you to ask  or would   become me to grant  you may be assured of my compliance       The astonishment Horatio was in at these words is impossible to be   expressed  but having an admirable presence of mind  my lord  answered   he  I should be unworthy of the favours you do me  could I be capable of   presuming on them so far as to make any requests beyond the   continuance of them       No  Horatio  resumed the baron  I acknowledge my gratitude has been too   deficient  since it has extended only to those civilities which are due   to your merit  exclusive of any obligation  the conversation we have had   together has hitherto afforded a pleasure to myself  and it is with a   good deal of mortification I now find a necessity to break it off   I   would therefore have the satisfaction of doing something that might   convince you of my esteem  at the same time that I desire you to refrain   your visits       Not all Horatio s courage could enable him to stand this shock  without   testifying some part of what passed in his mind   he was utterly   incapable of making any reply  tho  the silence of the other shewed he   expected it  but stood like one confounded  and conscious of deserving   the banishment he heard pronounced against him   At last recollecting   himself a little   my lord  said he  I see not how I can be happy enough   to preserve any part of your esteem  since looked upon as unworthy an   honour you were once pleased to confer upon me       You affect  said the baron  a slowness of apprehension  which is far   from being natural to you  and perhaps imagine  that by not seeming to   understand me  I should believe there were no grounds for me to forbid   you my house  but  young man  I am not so easily deceived  and since you   oblige me to speak plain  must tell you  I am sorry to find you have   entertained any projects  which  if you had the least consulted your   reason  you would have known could never be accomplished   In fine    Horatio  what you make so great a mystery of  may be explained in three   words   I wish you well as a friend  but cannot think of making you my   son   I would recompence what you have done for me with any thing but my   daughter  and as a proof of my concern for your happiness  I exclude you   from all society with her  in order to prevent so unavailing a passion   from taking too deep a root       Ah  my lord  cried Horatio  perceiving all dissimulation would be vain    the man who once adored mademoiselle de Palfoy can never cease to do so    He ought therefore  replied the baron  without being moved  to consider   the consequences well before he begins to adore   if I had been   consulted in the matter I should have advised you better  but it is now   too late  and all I can do is to prevent your ever meeting more   this    Horatio  is all I have to say  and that if in any other affair I can be   serviceable to you  communicate your request in writing  and depend on   its being granted       In speaking these last words he withdrew  and left Horatio in a   situation of mind not easy to be conceived   He was once about to   entreat him to turn back  but had nothing to offer which could make him   hope would prevail on him to alter his resolution   He never had been   insensible of the vast disparity there was at present between him and   the noble family of de Palfoy  he could expect no other  or rather worse   treatment than what he had now received  if his passion was ever   discovered  and had no excuse to make for what himself allowed so great   a presumption       With a countenance dejected  and a heart oppressed with various   agitations  did he quit the house which contained what was most valuable   to him in the world  while poor Charlotta endured  if possible  a   greater shock       The baron de Palfoy  now convinced that all he had been informed of was   true  was more incensed against her than he had been
