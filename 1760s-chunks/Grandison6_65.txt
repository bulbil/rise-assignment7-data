if you don t  that the true modesty  after hearts are united  is to think little of parade  and much of the social happiness that awaits two worthy minds united by Love  and conformity of sentiment—After all  we are silly creatures  Harriet  We are afraid of wise men  No wonder that we seldom choose them  when a fool offers  I wish I knew the man  however  who dare to say this in my hearing   Your grandmother Shirley is more than woman  My brother prodigiously admires her  I think you may trust to her judgment  if you suppose him too precipitating  Your aunt is an excellent woman  But I never knew a woman or man  who valued themselves on delicacy  and found themselves consulted upon it  but was apt to over do the matter  Is not this a little  a very little  Mrs  Selby s case  Let her know  that I bid you ask this question of herself  She must be assured that I equally love and honour her  so won t be angry   Your uncle is an odd  but a very honest Dunstable soul  Tell him  I say so  but withal  that he should leave women to act as women  in these matters  What a duce  what a pize  would he expect perfection from them  He  whose arguments always run in the depreciating strain  If he would  ask him  Where should they have it  conversing  as they are obliged to do  with men  Men for their fathers  for their brothers    162 for their uncles—They must be a little silly  had they not a fund of silliness in themselves —But I would not have them be most out in matters where they should be most in   I think  however  so does Lady L  that so far as you have proceeded  you are tolerable  tho  not  half so clever as he  considering situations  Upon my word  Harriet  allowing for every thing  neither of Sir Charles Grandison s sisters expected that their brother would have made so ardent  so polite  a Lover  He is so prudent a man  and that once had like to have been one of your  even your objections —Yet so nobly sincere—so manly  O that my ape—But come  Harriet  as men go in this age of monkeys and Sir Foplings  Lord G   for all you   is not to be despised  I  as a good wise ought  will take his part  whoever runs him down  Where much is not given  much  and so forth—  I have told Emily the good news  I could not help it  tho  you promise to write to her   Poor thing  she is all ecstasy  she is not the only one who seeks  as her greatest good  what may possibly prove her greatest misfortune  But  for her sake for your sake  and my brother s  I hope  under your directing eye  and by prudent management  the flame so young  a little cold water will do  and that if it will blaze  it may be directed towards Beauchamp s house   Let me whisper you again  Harriet—Young girls finding themselves vested with new powers  and a set of new inclinations  turn their staring eyes out of themselves  and the first man they see  they imagine  if he be a single man  and but simpers at them  they must receive him as a Lover  Then they return downcast for ogle  that he may ogle on without interruption  They are soon brought to write answers to Letters which confess flames the writer s heart never felt  The girl doubts not her own gifts  her own   163 consequence  she wonders that her father  mother  and other friends  never told her of these new found excellencies  She is more and more beautiful in her own eyes  as he more and more flatters her  If her parents are a  verse  the girl is per  verse  and the more  the less discretion there is in her passion  She adopts the word constancy  she declaims against persecution  she calls her idle flame  LOVE  which only was a Something she knew not what to make of—and  like a wandering bee  had it not settled on this flower  would on the next  were it either bitter or sweet   And this generally  with the thoughtless  is the beginning and progress of that formidable invader  miscalled Love  a word very happily at hand  to help giddy creatures to talk with  and look without confusion of face on  a man telling them a thousand lyes  and hoping  perhaps by illaudable means  to attain an end not in itself illaudable  when duty and discretion are  the one the guide  the other the gentle restraint   But as to Emily—I depend on her principles  as well as on your affectionate discretion  when you will be pleased  among ye  to permit my brother to be actually yours  for restraining her imagination  There never beat in Female bosom an honester heart  Poor thing  she is but a girl  And who is the woman
