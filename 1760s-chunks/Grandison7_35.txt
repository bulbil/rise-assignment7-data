your goodness to me  I find I may own all my weakness  my folly  to you  and the rather  as I shall intitle myself by it to your advice  I wanted to do   88 it  but was afraid you would hate me  In the same circumstances I doubt I should not be so generous as you are  O that I had not put my case to the Doctor   The Doctor  my dear  is all goodness  He will keep your secret—  And not tell my guardian  madam▪ any thing about it  It would be worse than death to me  if my guardian should mistrust me  He would hate the poor Emily  if you did not   He never shall know it  my dear  You have already engaged the Doctor to secrecy  I doubt not   I have   He will inviolably keep your secret  no fear  especially as your charming ingenuousness to me  will be a means of putting you and me  my Love  on finding expedients  that shall equally secure your honour  and your guardian s regard for you   That  madam  is the very thing   Open then to me your innocent heart  my dear  Regard me  as your friend  your sister  and as if I were not the happy wife of your beloved guardian—  And so I will —I did not  madam  mistrust myself till the solemnity had passed  that made you and my guardian one  Then I began to be uneasy with myself  and the more  as I was for hiding myself from myself  as I may say  for I was afraid of looking into my heart  Why so  thought I  Am I not an innocent girl  What do I wish for  What can I hope for  Do I not love Lady Grandison  I do  Yet now and then—Don t hate me  madam  I will reveal to you all my heart  and all my weakness   Proceed  my Emily  This is indeed a token of your love  of your confidence in me  What a compliment does my dearest younger sister make to her elder   Yet now and then  something like Envy  I thought  arose in my heart  And can your countenance forbear to change  when I tell you of Envy     89 If it did  it would be from compassionate Love to my Emily  You don t know  my dear  how my heart dilates on this your most agreeable confidence in me   God bless that dear heart —There never was such a heart as yours  Well  but I will go on if you please   Do  my dear   Here  thought I  once  that I was resolved to call myself to account  did I ask the favour of being allowed to live with my guardian and his Lady  when they were married  And what did I mean by it  Nothing but innocence  believe me  Well  and my request is granted  This was all that I thought was wanting to make me happy  But  said I to myself  am I happy  No  Do I love my guardian less  No  Do I love Lady Grandison more for granting me this favour  I admire her more  I think  and I have a grateful sense of her goodness to me  But  I don t know how it is—I think  tho  I dearly love her  yet I would be sometimes glad I did not  quite so well  Ungrateful Emily  And severely I took myself to task  Surely  pity  madam  is near akin to Love  for while your suspenses lasted  I thought I loved you better than I loved my own heart  But when you were happy  and there was no room for pity  wicked wretch that I was  I wanted  methought  sometimes to lower you —Don t you hate me now   No  no  my Emily  my Pity  as you say  increases my Love of you  Proceed  child  your mind is the unsullied book of nature  Turn to another Leaf  Depend upon my kindest allowances  I knew  before you knew it yourself  that you loved your guardian   Before I knew it myself  Why that might be  So I went on reasoning with myself—   What  Emily  canst thou love thy guardian more  and Lady Grandison  with all her goodness to me  not more—And canst thou mingle envy with admiration of   90 her —Ah  silly  and worse that silly  girl  where may this end —Lord bless me  If I suffer myself to go on thus  shall I not be the most ungrateful of creatures  Shall I not  instead of my guardian s love  incur his hatred  Will not all the world despise me —And where may this stop    —Yet I went on excusing myself  for I knew I had no vile meaning  I knew I only wanted my guardian to love me  and to be allowed to love him  But what  thought I  at last  can I allow myself inloving a married man  the husband of my friend
