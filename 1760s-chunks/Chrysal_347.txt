him  Riches   give consequence  especially with those who sacrifice everything   to luxury  Though he had no public power  his personal influence   over in fividuals in a short time became greater than ever  as he   too soon had an opportunity of proving      One of those events which show the vanity of all human designs    however wisely conducted  and glorious in their end  threw the   government into other hands    New men always adopt new   measures  if only from an affectation of appearing wiser than their   predecessors  In this change his late patron lost all influence   except that which virtue establishes in the hearts of the virtuous    This was an opportunity for shaking off the weight of obligation   not to be missed by one of our hero s turn  He not only deserted   him directly in the basest manner  but also  to ingratiate himself   with the present powers  fathered upon him the fictions of his own   brain  under the appearance of betraying his secrets  and made   a merit of aggravating his ingratitude and perfidy by open insults   in hope of provoking him to some unguarded act or expression   of resentment  which might give advantage against him  by the   common trick of applying to the master what is meant to the   servant  But  for once  all his art failed  Confident in conscious   innocence and merit  he disdained to give weight to such base   machinations by taking notice of them   and receiving this in        After the resignation of the Newcastle ministry in 1756  the King   invited Fox and Pitt to form an administration  but the latter declined   to act with Fox  In the Pitt Newcastle ministry  which came into   power in 1757  Fox was appointed to the subordinate but immensely   lucrative ofiBce of Paymaster of the Forces  In this post he built up   an enormous fortune  and won himself a black reputation for misap    propriation of public funds        The death of George II  George III was opposed to the war policy   of the Pitt Newcastle administration  He humbled Newcastle  opposed   the Whigs on every point  forced Pitt to resign  and then Newcastle    and so made way for the ascendency of Bute  who settled the Peace of   Paris in 1763          416 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     gratitude as a punishment for having placed his esteem so un    worthily  looked down upon him with indignant contempt  nor   was ever heard to honour his name with utterance  Such a proof   of his sincerity gained our hero the confidence of his new friends    to whose tottering power his personal interest was found a necessary   support  But he lent not that support but on his own terms    Cooled by experience  he had learned that the name of power is   always pursued by envy and ambition  He  therefore  wisely   gratified the vanity of others with the dangerous shadow  while   he reserved the substance to himself  dictating in safety  because   in secret  all the measures  for any mistake in which they were   answerable      In this situation you see him now  But such a series of suc    cess has been far from procuring him the happiness proposed in   the pursuit  BecoUection of the means embitters the end  The   ingratitude and perfidy of one    whom he had placed his whole   confidence in  and bound to him by the highest obligations  up    braid him continually with his own baseness to his patron  and   make him afraid to place trust in any other   so that he lives in   a state of constant suspicion and dread of all mankind  destitute   of that friendly confidence which is the cement of society  the   comfort and support of life      Nor is this the only wound that rankles in his breast  The un    happy victim of his avarice  murdered under the formalities of   law  is never absent from his thoughts a moment  Conjured up   by conscience  his spectre haunts his dreams  He sees him in the   dark  He hears him in the deepest silence  Nor can the loud   laugh of mirth and riot drown his louder voice in the midst of   company  Hence that gloom which you see hang upon his brow     that consciousness of guilt  which gives a cast of horror to his very   smiles  Consider now the story of this man   and own with rever    ence and awe that vice never wants an avenger   that wickedness   is its own punishment  Who would not rather be the apparent   wretch that wanders homeless through the world  fed by the cold
