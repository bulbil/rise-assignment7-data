the scene was given   up to the men  who rifled all  living and dead  with the most un    relenting severity  and retaliated their wicked intentions with   exemplary justice on the miserable criminals  stripping them quite   naked  and binding them with the very cords which they took off   their destined victims  who were unbound with the tenderest care    and carried away till their parents should be discovered  or  in case   that could not be  to be educated at the public expense  as the         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 227     children of the state  while their intended murderers were thrown   into prison  till a punishment should be appointed severe enough   for their guilt  In the confusion of this affair  I fell into the hands   of the officer who had found his child  whose passions were raised   so high by the recovery of him  that  as soon as the plunder was   oyer  he left his charge to another  and retired to share his joy with   his disconsolate wife  The tenderness of this meeting was a just   reverse of the former part of the last scene  where the helpless infants   were led forth to be slaughtered      As the Jews were some of the wealthiest of the inhabitants  and   carried on a great part of the trade of the city  the magistrates  to   prevent the imputation of injustice  and to set the whole affair in   a proper light to the world  convened the people early the next   morning  where the rescued infants were produced on one side  and   the few that remained alive of their intended butchers on the other    when my new master  who bore a considerable office in the state    besides his military command  unfolded the whole affair in a short   but moving speech  He told them that  having lost his only   child  the infant there present  about a month before  and having   been informed  when he served in Poland in his youth  that the   Jews had a custom of stealing and sacrificing or murdering infants   on the night when they celebrated their Passover  he made no search   for him  but seemed to believe a story which he had invented him    self to appease the distraction of his wife  that he had been killed   and devoured by a tame wolf that was kept in the garden of his   country house  from whence he was stolen  watching  in the mean    time  every motion of the Jews with such exactness that he had   punctual information of their meeting at the place where he had   seized them the evening before  where it was to be lamented that   the just resentment of the soldiers had anticipated the severer hand   of justice   and saved them from the laws  the judgment of which he   now demanded against the remaining few for himself  and for the   unknown parents of the innocent victims  whom they saw before them      A roar of universal indignation pursued his words  which had in    flamed the rage and detestation of the people so high  that they   were with difficulty restrained from tearing the wretches instantly   to pieces by the same arguments which had saved them from the   soldiers before  Nor were the Jews admitted to say a word in   their own defence  for  though none of the infants had been actually   murdered that night  yet the intention was beyond controversy    and  besides  many of the people who had formerly lost their   children  now charged them with their murder  with the strongest   appearance of justice      They were therefore dragged back to prison  where they lay    loaded with chains till the day of their execution  when they were   all publicly burned aUve on the very spot where they were to have   perpetrated their guilt  the house being raised to the ground for   that purpose  and all the effects of such as were taken in this fact   confiscated to the use of the state          228 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA         CHAPTER XX     A BUEAOH OF NBTTTBALITY PBOPBELY EBSENTBD BBINGS CHEYSAL   INTO A SBEVICB WHICH HE HAD LONG BEEN AMBITIOTTS OB â€” HOW   HE BOUND HIS NEW MASTEE EMPLOYED â€” THE KING OB BITLOAEIa S   EECEPTION OF THE HUMBLED MAGISTRATES â€” HIS APPEOPEIATION   OB MONEY TO HIS OWN USE â€” HIS EEFLECTIONS ON THE SIGHT OF   CHEYSAL     This affair was scarce ended  when I changed my master again    The city in which I was had professed a neutrality in the present   war  but whether yielding to inclination  or biased by private   interest  the magistrates had  on many occasions  shown
