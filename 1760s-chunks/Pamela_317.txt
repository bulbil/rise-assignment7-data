around the dear   generous man  How shall I support this  So very cruel  yet so very kind       Don t  my dear  said he  be concerned at what gives me pleasure  I am   not the nearer my end  for having made this disposition  but I think   the putting off these material points  when so many accidents every day   happen  and life is so precarious  is one of the most inexcusable things   in the world  And there are many important points to be thought of  when   life is drawing to its utmost verge  and the mind may be so agitated   and unfit  that it is a most sad thing to put off  to that time  any of   those concerns  which more especially require a considerate and composed   frame of temper  and perfect health and vigour  to give directions   about  My poor friend  Mr  Carlton  who died in my arms so lately  and   had a mind disturbed by worldly considerations on one side  a weakness   of body  through the violence of his distemper  on another  and the   concerns of still as much more moment  as the soul is to the body  on   a third  made so great an impression upon me then  that I was the more   impatient to come to this house  where were most of my writings  in   order to make the disposition I have now perfected  And since it is   grievous to my dear girl  I will myself think of such trustees as shall   be most for her benefit  I have only  therefore  to assure you  my dear    that in this instance  as I will do in any other I can think of  I have   studied to make you quite easy  free  and independent  And because I   shall avoid all occasions  for the future  which may discompose you  I   have but one request to make  which is  that if it please God  for my   sins  to separate me from my dearest Pamela  you will only resolve not   to marry one person  for I would not be such a Herod  as to restrain   you from a change of condition with any other  however reluctantly I may   think of any other person s succeeding me in your esteem       I could not answer  and thought my heart would have burst  And he   continued  To conclude at once a subject that is so grievous to you  I   will tell you  my Pamela  that this person is Mr  Williams  And now I   will acquaint you with my motive for this request  which is wholly owing   to my niceness  and to no dislike I have for him  or apprehension of any   likelihood that it will be so  but  methinks it would reflect a little   upon my Pamela  if she was to give way to such a conduct  as if she had   married a man for his estate  when she had rather have had another    had it not been for that  and that now  the world will say  she is at   liberty to pursue her inclination  the parson is the man   And I cannot   bear even the most distant apprehension  that I had not the preference   with you  of any man living  let me have been what I would  as I   have shewn my dear life  that I have preferred her to all her sex  of   whatever degree       I could not speak  might I have had the world  and he took me in his   arms  and said  I have now spoken all my mind  and expect no answer  and   I see you too much moved to give me one  Only forgive me the mention    since I have told you my motive  which as much affects your reputation    as my niceness  and offer not at an answer   only say  you forgive me    And I hope I have not one discomposing thing to say to my dearest  for   the rest of my life  which I pray God  for both our sakes  to lengthen   for many happy years       Grief still choaked up the passage of my words  and he said  The shower   is over  my dear  let us walk out again   He led me out  and I would   have spoken  but he said  I will not hear my dear creature say any   thing  To hearken to your assurance of complying with my request  would   look as if I doubted you  and wanted it  I am confident I needed only   to speak my mind  to be observed by you  and I shall never more think on   the subject  if you
