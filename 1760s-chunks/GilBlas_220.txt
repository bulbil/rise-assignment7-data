to repeat the lines I had already spouted  they fell into a sort of enthusiastic trance  whence they were roused only to launch out fervently in admiration of me  Literally  had they all three been flattering me up for a wager  they could not have adopted a more extravagant scale of panegyric  My modesty was not proof against such praise from those who were themselves praised  I began to think myself really worthy of something  and now was my whole heart and soul turned towards a theatrical life   Since this is the case  said I to Phenicia  the affair is determined  I will follow your advice and engage in your company  if they will accept me  My friend  transported with joy at this proposal  clasped me in her arms  and her two companions seemed no less delighted than herself at finding me in that humour  It was settled that I should attend the theatre on the following day in the morning  and exhibit before the collected body the same sample of my talent as I had just displayed  If I had bought golden opinions from Phenicia and her friends  the actors in general were still more complimentary in their judgment  after I had recited but twenty lines before them  They gave me an engagement with the utmost willingness  Then there was nothing thought of but my first appearance  To make it as striking as possible  I laid out all the money remaining from the sale of my ring  and though my funds would not allow of being splendid in my dress  I discovered the art of substituting taste for glitter  and converting my poverty into a new grace   At length I came out  What clapping of hands  what general admiration  It would be speaking faintly  my friend  to tell you downright that the spectators were all in an ecstacy  You must have heard with your own ears what a noise I made at Seville  to believe it  The whole talk of the town was about me  and the house was crowded for three weeks successively  so that this novelty restored the theatre to its popularity  when it was evidently beginning to decline  Thus did I come upon the stage  and step into public favour at once  But to come upon the stage with such distinction  is generally a prelude to coming upon the town  or at least to putting one s self up at auction to the best bidder  Twenty sparks of all ages  from seventeen to seventy  were on the list of candidates  and would have worn me in my newest gloss  Had I followed my own inclination  I should have chosen the youngest  and the most of a lady s man  but in our profession  interest and ambition must bear the sway  till we have feathered our nest  that is as invariable a rule as any in the prompt book  On this principle  Don Ambrosio de Nisana  a man in whom age and ugliness had done their worst  but rich  generous  and one of the most powerful noblemen in Andalusia  had the refusal of the bargain  It is true that he paid handsomely for it  He took a fine house for me  furnished in the extreme of magnificence  allowed me a man cook of the first eminence  two footmen  a lady s maid  and a thousand ducats a month for my personal expenses  Add to all this a rich wardrobe  and an elegant assortment of jewels   What a revolution in my affairs  My poor brain was completely turned  I could not believe myself to be the same person  No wonder if girls soon forget the meanness and misery whence some man of quality has rescued them in a fit of caprice  My confession shall be without reserve  public applause  flattering speeches buzzed about on every side  and Don Ambrosio s passion kindled such a flame of self conceit as kept me in a continual ferment of extravagance  I considered my talents as a patent of nobility  I put on the woman of fashion  and becoming as chary as I had hitherto been lavish of my amorous challengers  determined to look no lower than dukes  counts  or marquises   My lord of Nisana brought some of his friends to sup with me every evening It was my care to invite the best companions among our actresses  and we wore away a good part of the night in laughing and drinking  I fell in very kindly with so delicious a life  but it lasted only six months  Men of rank are apt to be whimsical  but for that fault  they would be too heavenly  Don Ambrosio deserted me for a young coquette from Grenada  who had just brought a pretty person to the Seville market  and knew how to set off her wares to the best advantage  But I did not fret after him more than four and twenty hours  His place was supplied by a young fellow of two and twenty  Don Lewis d  Alcacer  with whom few Spaniards could vie in point of face and figure   You will ask me  doubtless  and it is natural to do so  why I selected so green a sprig of nobility for my paramour  when my own experience so strongly dissuaded from such a choice  But  besides that Don
