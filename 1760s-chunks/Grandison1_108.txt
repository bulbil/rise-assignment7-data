there are Miss Byron s     265 She told me  that Sir Charles had set out that morning early for Canterbury  He will be absent two or three days  said she  He charged me with his compliments  He did nothing but talk of his new found sister  from the time he parted with you  I shall promote your interest with him  in order to strengthen my own  I want to find him out   Some love engagements  I suppose  madam  said Mrs  Reeves—It is impossible  but the Ladies—  The Ladies  Ay  that s the thing▪ The duce is in them  They will not stay to be asked  These men  the best of them  love nothing but what is attended with difficulty  But all his Love matters he keeps to himself  yet knows all mine—Except one little entanglement—Mr  Reeves hears not what we say  looking about her   But you  my dear  shall reveal to me your sneaking passion  if you have one  and I will discover mine—But not to you  Mrs  Reeves  No married women shall I trust with what lies in the innermost fold of my heart  Your husbands are always the wiser for what you know  tho  they can keep their own counsel  and then  Harriet  Satan like  the ungenerous wretches  becoming both tempters and accusers  laugh at us  and make it wonderful for a woman to keep a secret   The Ladies will not stay to be asked  Lucy —An odd hint —These men  the best of them  love nothing but what comes to them with difficulty —He keeps all his Love matters to himself  ALL  my Lucy —But indeed she had said before  that if Sir Charles married  half a dozen hearts would be broken   This is nothing to me indeed  But  once more  I wonder why a man of a turn so laudable  should have any secrets  The more a good man permits any one to know of his heart  the more good he might do  by way of example —And has he  can he have  so many Love secrets  and yet will he not let them transpire to such a sister —Whom  and so she once hinted    266 it imported to know something of them  But  he knows best  I am very impertinent to be more concerned for his sister  than she is for herself  But I do love her  And one can no more bear to have those slighted whom we love  than one s self   It is very difficult  Lucy  to know one s self  I am afraid I have a little spice of censoriousness in my temper  which I knew nothing of till now  But  no  it is not censoriousness neither  I cannot be so mean  as to be censorious  And yet I can now  methinks  for the first time  a little account for those dark spirits who may be too much obliged  and who  despairing to be able ever to return the obligation  are ready to quarrel with the obliger   Spiteful men say  that we women know not ourselves  know not our own hearts  I believe there is something of truth in the aspersion  But as men and women are brothers and sisters  as I may say  are not the men equally censurable  And should not we women say so  were we to be as spiteful as they  Must it needs be  that a daughter of the same father and mother must be more silly  more unsteady  more absurd  more impertinent  than her brother —I hope not   Mrs  Reeves not knowing  as she said afterwards  but Miss Grandison might have something to say to me  withdrew   I believe I told you last Sunday  said Miss Grandison  of a cousin that we have  A good natured young fellow  He supped with us last night  Sir Charles was so full of your praises  yet not letting him into your history  that he is half wild to see you   God forbid  thought I  when she had gone only thus far  that this cousin should be proposed—What an easy thing is it  my Lucy  to alarm a woman on the side of her vanity   He breakfasted with me this morning  continued she  after Sir Charles had set out  and knowing that I intended to make you a flying visit  he besought me   267 to take him with me  But I would not  my dear  bring an inundation of new admirers upon you  He has a great acquaintance  and is very hold  tho  not indecent  He is thought to be a modern wit  you must know  and  to speak after an admirable writer  a minute philosopher  and thinks he has something to say for himself when his cousin is not present  Before Sir Charles arrived  and when we were in expectation of his coming  being appris d that Sir Charles had a serious turn  he threatened to play upon him  and  as he phrased it  to bamboozle him  for these wits and witlings have a language peculiar to themselves  But on Sir Charles s
