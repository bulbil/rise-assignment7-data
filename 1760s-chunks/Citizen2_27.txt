But will the greater number of readers take notice of these punishments and rewards  Are not their minds carried to something else  Can it be imagined that the art with which the author inspires the love of virtue  can overcome that crowd of thoughts which sway them to licentiousness  To be able to inculcate virtue by so leaky a vehicle  the author must be a philosopher of the first rank  But in our age we can find but few first rate philosophers    Avoid such performances where vice assumes the face of virtue  seek wisdom and knowledge without ever thinking you have found them  A man is wise  while he continues in the pursuit of wisdom  but when he once fancies that he has found the object of his enquiry  he then becomes a fool  Learn to pursue virtue from the man that is blind  who never makes a step without first examining the ground with his staff    The world is like a vast sea  mankind like a vessel sailing on its tempestuous bosom  Our prudence is its sails  the sciences serve us for oars  good or bad fortune are the favourable or contrary winds  and judgment is the rudder  without this last the vessel is tossed by every billow  and will find shipwreck in every breeze  In a   81 word  obscurity and indigence are the parents of vigilance and oeconomy  vigilance and oeconomy of riches and honour  riches and honour of pride and luxury  pride and luxury of impurity and idleness  and impurity and idleness again produce indigence and obscurity  Such are the revolutions of life   Adieu   LETTER LXXXI  From Lien Chi Altangi  to Fum Hoam  first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin  in China   I Fancy the character of a poet is in every country the same  fond of enjoying the present  careless of the future  his conversation that of a man of sense  his actions those of a fool  of fortitude able to stand unmoved at the bursting of an earthquake  yet of sensibility to be affected by the breaking of a tea cup  such is his character  which considered in every light is the very opposite of that which leads to riches   The poets of the west are as remarkable for their indigence as their genius  and yet among the numerous hospitals designed to relieve the poor  I have heard of but one erected for the benefit of decayed authors  This was founded by pope Urban VIII  and called the retreat of the incurables  intimating  that it was equally impossible to reclaim the patients  who sued for reception  from poverty  or from poetry  To be sincere  were I to send you an account of the lives of the western poets  either antient or modern  I fancy   82 you would think me employed in collecting materials for an history of human wretchedness   Homer is the first poet and beggar of note among the antients  he was blind  and sung his ballads about the streets  but it is observed  that his mouth was more frequently filled with verses than with bread  Plautus the comic poet was better off  he had two trades  he was a poet for his diversion  and helped to turn a mill in order to gain a livelihood  Terence was a slave  and Boethius died in a jail   Among the Italians  Paulo Burghese  almost as good a poet as Tasso  knew fourteen different trades  and yet died because he could get employment in none  Tasso himself  who had the most amiable character of all poets  has often been obliged to borrow a crown from some friend  in order to pay for a month s subsistence  he has left us a pretty sonnet  addressed to his cat  in which he begs the light of her eyes to write by  being too poor to afford himself a candle  But Bentivoglio  poor Bentivoglio  chiefly demands our pity  His comedies will last with the Italian language  he dissipated a noble fortune in acts of charity and benevolence  but falling into misery in his old age  was refused to be admitted into an hospital which he himself had erected   In Spain it is said  the great Cervantes died of hunger  and it is certain  that the famous Camoens ended his days in an hospital   If we turn to France  we shall there find even stronger instances of the ingratitude of the public  Vaugelas  one of the politest writers  and one of the   83 honestest men of his time  was sirnamed the Owl  from his being obliged to keep within all day  and venture out only by night  through fear of his creditors  His last will is very remarkable  after having bequeathed all his worldly substance to the discharging his debts  he goes on thus  But as there still may remain some creditors unpaid  even after all that I have shall be disposed of  in such a case  it is my last will  that my body should be sold to the surgeons to the best advantage  and that the purchase should go to the discharging those debts which I owe to society  so that if I could not  while living  at least when dead  I may be useful   Cassander
