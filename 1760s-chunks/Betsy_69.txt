 James s  and I hate your   jolting hackney coaches  besides  I may come and come again  and never   be able to get a word with you in private in an afternoon  and all the   morning I am engaged either at the India House  or at Change  therefore   I should think it is better for both of us not to stand shilly shally    but come to the point at once  for look ye  fair lady  if we happen to   agree  there will be little enough time to settle every thing  as I am   obliged to go soon     Too little  in my opinion  Sir   answered she     therefore I think it best to defer talking any more of the matter till   you come back         Come back   cried he   why  do you consider I shall be gone three   years     Really  Sir   said she   as I told you before  I have never   considered any thing about it  nor can promise I shall be able to say   any more to you at the end of twice the time you mention  than I can do   at present  which I assure you is just nothing at all        Though both Mr  Trueworth and Mr  Staple had too much good manners to do   any thing that might affront the captain  yet neither of them could   restrain their laughter so well as to prevent some marks of the   inclination they had for it  from being visible in their faces  and    willing to contribute something on their parts to the diversion they   perceived she gave herself with a lover so every way unsuitable to her    one told her that it was a great pity she did not consult the captain s   convenience  the other said  that it must needs be a vast fatigue for a   gentleman  who was accustomed only to walk the quarter deck  to take a   stretch of four miles at once   And all to no purpose   cried he that   had spoken first    Pray  Madam  give him his dispatch        As little acquainted as the captain was with raillery  he had   understanding enough to make him see  that Miss Betsy s behaviour to him   had rendered him the jest of all the company that visited her  and this   he took so ill  that all the liking he before had to her was now turned   into contempt  Finding they were going on in the ironical way they had   begun   Look ye  gentlemen   said he  with a pretty stern countenance     I would advise you to meddle only with such things as concern   yourselves  you have nothing to do with me  or I with you  If your   errand here be as I suspect it is  there sits one who I dare answer will   find you employment enough  as long as you shall think it worth your   while to dance attendance   As for you  Madam   continued he  turning to   Miss Betsy   I think it would have become you as well to have given me a   more civil answer  if you did not approve of my proposals  you might   have told me so at first  but I shall trouble neither you nor myself any   farther about the matter  I see how it is  well enough  and when next I   steer for the coast of matrimony  shall take care to look out for a port   not cumbered with rubbish  so  your servant        As he was going out of the house  he met Lady Mellasin and Miss Flora   just entering  being returned from the ramble above mentioned  they saw   he was very angry  and would fain have persuaded him to turn back    telling him  that if any misunderstanding had happened between him and   Miss Betsy  they would endeavour to make it up and reconcile them  To   which he replied  that he thanked them for their love  but he had done   with Miss Betsy for good and all  that she was no more than a young   flirt  and did not know how to use a gentleman handsomely  said  he   should be glad to take a bowl of punch with Mr  Goodman before he went   on his voyage  but would not come any more to his house  to be scoffed   at by Miss Betsy  and those that came after her       Miss Flora told him  that it was unjust in him to deprive her mamma and   herself of the pleasure of his good company for the fault of Miss Betsy    who  she said  she could not help owning  was of a very giddy temper
