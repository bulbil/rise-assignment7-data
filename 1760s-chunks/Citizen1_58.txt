ever pursued the great even to the tomb  whence this more than fiend like disposition of embittering the lives of those who would make us more wise and more happy   When I cast my eye over the fates of several philosophers  who have at different periods enlightened mankind  I must confess it inspires me with the most degrading reflections on humanity    182 When I read of the stripes of Mentius  the tortures of Tchin  the bowl of Socrates  and the bath of Seneca  when I hear of the persecutions of Dante  the imprisonment of Galileo  the indignities suffered by Montange  the banishment of Cartesius  the infamy of Bacon  and that even Locke himself escaped not without reproach  when I think on such subjects  I hesitate whether most to blame  the ignorance or the villany of my fellow creatures   Should you look for the character of Voltaire among the journalists and illiterate writers of the age  you will there find him characterized as a monster  with a head turned to wisdom  and an heart inclining to vice  the powers of his mind and the baseness of his principles forming a detestable contrast  But seek for his character among writers like himself  and you find him very differently described  You perceive him in their accounts possessed of good nature  humanity  greatness of soul  fortitude  and almost every virtue  in this description those who might be suppos d best acquainted with his character are unanimous  The royal Prussian   Dargens†  Diderot §  D alambert  and Fontenelle conspire in drawing the picture  in describing the friend of man and the patron of every rising genius   An inflexible perseverance in what he thought was right  and a generous detestation of flattery  formed the ground work of this great man s character  From these principles many strong virtues and few faults arose  as he was warm in his friendship  and severe in resentment  all that   183 mention him seem possessed of the same qualities  and speak of him with rapture or detestation  A person of his eminence can have few indifferent as to his character  every reader must be an enemy or an admirer   This poet began the course of glory so early as the age of eighteen  and even then was author of a tragedy which deserves applause  possessed of a small patrimony he preserved his independance  in an age of venality  and supported the dignity of learning  by teaching his cotemporary writers to live like him  above the favours of the great  He was banished his native country for a satire upon the royal concubine  He had accepted the place of historian to the French king  but refused to keep it  when he found it was presented only in order that he should be the first flatterer of the state   The great Prussian received him as an ornament to his kingdom  and had sense enough to value his friendship  and profit by his instructions  In this court he continued till an intrigue  with which the world seems hitherto unacquainted  obliged him to quit that country  His own happiness  the happiness of the monarch  of his sister  of a part of the court  rendered his departure necessary   Tired at length of courts  and all the follies of the great  he retired to Switzerland  a country of liberty  where he enjoyed tranquility and the muse  Here  though without any taste for magnificence himself  he usually entertained at his table the learned and polite of Europe  who were   184 attracted by a desire of seeing a person from whom they had received so much satisfaction  The entertainment was conducted with the utmost elegance  and the conversation was that of philosophers  Every country that at once united liberty and science  were his peculiar favourites  The being an Englishman was to him a character that claimed admiration and respect   Between Voltaire and the disciples of Confucius  there are many differences  however  being of a different opinion does not in the least diminish my esteem  I am not displeased with my brother  because he happens to ask our father for favours in a different manner from me  Let his errors rest in peace  his excellencies deserve admiration  let me with the wise admire his wisdom  let the envious and the ignorant ridicule his foibles  the folly of others is ever most ridiculous to those who are themselves most foolish   Adieu   LETTER XLIII  From Lien Chi Altangi to Hingpo  a slave in Persia  IT is impossible to form a philosophic system of happiness which is adapted to every condition in life  since every person who travels in this great pursuit takes a separate road  The differing colours which suit different complections  are not more various than the different pleasures appropriated to particular minds  The various sects who have pretended to give lessons   185 to instruct men in happiness  have described their own particular sensations without considering ours  have only loaded their disciples with constraint  without adding to their real felicity   If I find pleasure in dancing  how ridiculous would it be in me to prescribe such an amusement for the entertainment of a cripple  should he  on the other hand  place his chief delight in painting  yet would he be absurd in recommending the same relish
