no questions  and do you do all in   your power to oblige her  She said she would  to be sure       He took my hand  and said  One thing I will tell you  Pamela  because   I know you will be glad to hear it  and yet not care to ask me  I had    before you went  taken Williams s bond for the money  for how the poor   man had behaved I can t tell  but he could get no bail  and if I have no   fresh reason given me  perhaps I shall not exact the payment  and he has   been some time at liberty  and now follows his school  but  methinks  I   could wish you would not see him at present       Sir  said I  I will not do any thing to disoblige you wilfully  and I am   glad he is at liberty  because I was the occasion of his misfortunes    I durst say no more  though I wanted to plead for the poor gentleman    which  in gratitude  I thought I ought  when I could do him service  I   said  I am sorry  sir  Lady Davers  who loves you so well  should have   incurred your displeasure  and that there should be any variance between   your honour and her  I hope it was not on my account  He took out of   his waistcoat pocket  as he sat in his gown  his letter case  and said    Here  Pamela  read that when you go up stairs  and let me have your   thoughts upon it  and that will let you into the affair       He said he was very heavy of a sudden  and would lie down  and indulge   for that day  and if he was better in the morning  would take an airing   in the chariot  And so I took my leave for the present  and went up   to my closet  and read the letter he was pleased to put into my hands    which is as follows             BROTHER        I am very uneasy at what I hear of you  and must write  whether   it please you or not  my full mind  I have had some people with me    desiring me to interpose with you  and they have a greater regard for   your honour  than  I am sorry to say it  you have yourself  Could I   think  that a brother of mine would so meanly run away with my late dear   mother s waiting maid  and keep her a prisoner from all her friends  and   to the disgrace of your own  But I thought  when you would not let the   wench come to me on my mother s death  that you meant no good   I blush   for you  I ll assure you  The girl was an innocent  good girl  but I   suppose that s over with her now  or soon will  What can you mean by   this  let me ask you  Either you will have her for a kept mistress  or   for a wife  If the former  there are enough to be had without ruining   a poor wench that my mother loved  and who really was a very good girl    and of this you may be ashamed  As to the other  I dare say you don t   think of it  but if you should  you would be utterly inexcusable    Consider  brother  that ours is no upstart family  but is as ancient   as the best in the kingdom  and  for several hundreds of years  it has   never been known  that the heirs of it have disgraced themselves by   unequal matches  And you know you have been sought to by some of the   best families in the nation  for your alliance  It might be well enough    if you were descended of a family of yesterday  or but a remove or two   from the dirt you seem so fond of  But  let me tell you  that I  and all   mine  will renounce you for ever  if you can descend so meanly  and I   shall be ashamed to be called your sister  A handsome man  as you are    in your person  so happy in the gifts of your mind  that every body   courts your company  and possessed of such a noble and clear estate  and   very rich in money besides  left you by the best of fathers and mothers    with such ancient blood in your veins  untainted  for you to throw away   yourself thus  is intolerable  and it would be very wicked in you to   ruin the wench too  So that I beg
