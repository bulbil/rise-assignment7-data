they behaved with that morose and sullen carriage which is ever the result of narrow manners and solitary thinking  They secretly laboured the abasement of the Presbyterians  yet joined them in their efforts to depress the King   Charles  now perceiving the parliaments of England and Scotland united against him  and fearing to fall under their united efforts  thought proper to make a truce with the Papists of Ireland  in order to bring ever the English troops who served in that kingdom  By this means he not only had many of the English troops that served there  but also several of the native Irish who came to increase his army  It was then the parliament complained with truth of his employing Papists in his service  and still farther extended their reproach by saying that he encouraged them to rebel  These troops  however  only served to procure the hatred of his subjects  without strengthening his army  They were totally routed by Fairfax  one of the generals of the parliament army  and slaughtered without mercy after a submission  It was said  that several Irish women were found among the slain  who with long knives did considerable execution  but the animosity of the English against those wretches  at that time  might have given rise to the calumny   One misfortune now seemed to follow close upon another  Prince Rupert  who had long sustained the honour of the royal arms  was defeated at York  and his army dispersed by Fairfax  Charles had retired to Oxford  his present danger excited his friends to   30 new efforts  he levied new forces  and had some slight success  But this appearance of good fortune did not continue  His army was turbulent and seditious  that of the parliament every day improved in discipline  and obeyed from principle  Among instances of this nature was that act called the self denying ordinance  by which it was resolved  that no member of the house of commons should have a command in the army  The reasons assigned for this were specious  and perhaps sincere  It was done to prevent the parliament s wishing for a continuance of the war  in order to enjoy a continuing share of authority  The former generals were therefore changed  the Earl of Essex  Denbigh  and Manchester gave up their commissions  and Fairfax  with the assistance of Cromwell  new modelled the army without any opposition   It was the general opinion  that this new alteration would enfeeble the parliament army  but the event proved otherwise  they were  after this  every where victorious  Both armies met near Naseby  The King  who commanded the main body of his own troops  shewed himself upon this occasion a courageous general  encouraging his soldiers where giving way  and rallying them in person when broken  The enemy  however  was victorious  wherever Cromwell fought  he brought conquest and terror  and the defeat of the royal army was principally owing to him  This fatal blow the King could never after recover  All his infantry were so scattered that the enemy took as many prisoners as they pleased  his baggage  and cabinet in which his most secret papers were contained  fell into the hands of his pursuers  and yet  after all  there were not above six hundred men slain upon the field of battle   It was now that Cromwell s courage and genius began to appear  he had hitherto been only a turbulent speaker in the house of commons  and the   31 leader of a regiment in the army  But he now discovered talents greater than his employments  and his present success opened to him the prospects of ambition  which he never after lost sight of  Historians seldom distinguish properly in the changes to be found in the same character  it is probable Cromwell began to act in the state with principles of conviction and sincerity  but  new occurrences arising  his soul was not proof to the allurements of fortune  he gave way to her seducing call  Had he been on the oppressed side  he might have displayed surprising instances of constancy and integrity  but  happening to be victorious  he became a tyrant and usurper  and bathed his country with royal blood   Cromwell was possessed of apparent humility and internal pride  This is just the character which Machiavel describes for a successful usurper  He was originally the son of a private gentleman of a moderate fortune  who had some years before attempted leaving the kingdom upon a principle of religion  but was prevented by the King  This religious deportment Cromwell ever inviolably preserved  it secured him an ascendancy in the house of commons  where the majority were enthusiasts  it gained him the affections of Fairfax the general  who was courageous  ignorant  and sincere  It acquired him the love of the army  where his presence was coveted  and he alone was permitted to unite the military and civil employments in his person  for he had a seat in the house while he was a colonel in the field  But he was still resolved farther to strengthen his interests by attaching the Independants privately to his side  they increased in numbers and power by his means  and he  in return  found them resolute and persevering friends   The battle of Naseby seemed fatal to the interests of the King
