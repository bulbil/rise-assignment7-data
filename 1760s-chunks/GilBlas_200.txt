as much indifference as I could put on  what was this mighty discovery about which he made such a piece of work  Lorenza  whispered he  smuggles the surgeon of the village every evening into her apartment  he is a tight vessel  well armed and manned  and the pirate generally stays pretty long upon his cruise  I do not mean to say  added he  with supercilious candour but that all this may be perfectly innocent on both sides  but you cannot help admitting  that where a young man does insinuate himself slily into a girl s bedchamber he takes better care of his own pleasure than of her reputation   Though this tale gave me as much uneasiness as if I had been verily and romantically in love  I had too much sense to let him know it  but so far stifled my feelings as to laugh heartily at a story which struck at the very life of all my hopes  But when no witnesses were by  I made myself full amends for having gulped down my rising indignation  I blustered and stormed  muttered blessings on them the wrong way  and swore outright  but all this without coming nearer to a decision on my own conduct  At one time  holding Lorenza in utter contempt  it was my good pleasure to give her up altogether  without condescending so far as to come to any explanation with the coquette  At an other time  laying it down as a principle  that my honour was concerned in making the surgeon an example to all intriguers  I spirited up my courage to call him out  Thus dangerous valour prevailed over safe indifference  At the approach of evening I placed myself in ambuscade  and sure enough the gentleman did slink into the temple of my Vesta  with a fear of being found out that spoke rather unfavourably for the purity of his designs  Nothing short of this could have kept my rage alive against the chilliness of the night air  I immediately quitted the precincts of the castle  and posted myself on the high road  where the gay deceiver was sure to be intercepted on his return  I waited for him with my fighting spirits on the full boil  my impatience increased with the lapse of time  till Mars and Bellona seemed to inhabit my frame  and enlarge it beyond human dimensions  At length my antagonist came in sight  I took a few strides  such as bully Mars or Bellona might have taken  but I do not know how the devil it came to pass  my courage went further off as my body came nearer  my frame was contracted within somewhat less than its human dimensions  and my heart felt exactly like the heart of a coward  The hearts of Homer s heroes felt exactly the same  when the dastardly dogs were not backed by a supernatural drawcansir  In short  I was just as much out of my element as ever Paris was  when he pitted himself against Menelaus in single combat  I began taking measure of this operator in love  war  and anatomy  He appeared to be large limbed and well knit  with a sword by his side of a most abominable length  All this made me consider  that the better part of valour is discretion  nevertheless  whether from the superiority of mind over the nervous system in a case of honour  or from whatever other cause  though the danger grew bigger as the distance diminished  and in spite of nature  which pleaded obstinately that honour is a mere scutcheon  and can neither set a leg nor take away the grief of a wound  I mustered up boldness enough to march forward towards the surgeon sword in hand   My proceeding seemed to him to be of the drollest  What is the matter  Signor Gil Blas  exclaimed he  Why all this fire and fury  You are in a bantering mood  to all appearance  No  good master shaver  answered I  no such thing  there never was anything more serious since Cain killed Abel  I am determined to try the experiment  whether as little preparation serves your turn in the field of battle as in a lady s chamber  Hope not that you will be suffered to possess without a rival that heaven of bliss in which you have been indulging but this moment at the castle  By all the martyrdoms we phlebotomizers have ever suffered or inflicted  replied the surgeon  setting up a shout of laughter  this is a most whimsical adventure  As heaven is my judge  appearances are very little to be trusted  At this put off  fancying that he had no keener stomach for cold iron than myself  I got to be I ten times more over bearing  Teach your parrot to speak better Spanish  my friend  interrupted I  do you think we do not know a hawk from a hernshaw  Imagine not that the simple denial of the fact will settle the business  I see plainly  replied he  that I shall be obliged to speak out  or some mischief must happen either to you or me  I shall therefore disclose a secret to you  though men in our profession cannot be too much on the reserve  If Dame Lorenza sends for me into her apartment under suspicious circumstances  it is only to conceal from the servants the knowledge of
