perhaps to have shewn more pity than resentment     286 It was owing to my regard for the delicacy of you sister  Signor Jeronymo  said I  for whom I have the tenderest sentiments   as well as to do Justice to my own conduct towards her  that I could not help showing myself affected by the word refused   Affected by the word refused  Sir  said the General—Yes  you have soft words for hard meanings  But I  who have not your choice of words  make use of those that are explained by actions   I was in hopes  my Lord  that I might rather have been favoured with your weight in the proposed compromise  than to have met with your displeasure   Consider  Chevalier  coolly consider this matter  How shall we answer it to our country   We are public people  Sir   to the church  to which we stand related  to our own character  to marry a daughter of our house to a Protestant  You say you are concerned for her honour  What must we  what can we say in her behalf  when she is reflected upon as a Lovesick girl  who  tho  stedfast in her religion  could refuse men of the first consideration  all of her own religion and country  and let a foreigner  an Englishman  carry her off —  Preserving nevertheless by stipulation  you will remember  my Lord  her religion —If you shall have so much to answer for to the world with such a stipulation in the Lady s favour  What shall I be thought of  who  tho  I am not  nor wish to be  a public man  am not of a low or inconsiderable family  if I  against my conscience  renounce my religion and my country  for a consideration  that  tho  the highest in private life  is a partial and selfish consideration   No more  no more  Sir—If you can despise worldly grandeur  if you can set light by Riches  Honours  Love  my sister has this to be said in her praise  that she is the first woman  that ever I heard of  who f•ll in love with a philosopher  And she must  I think  take the consequence of such a peculiarity  Her example will not have many followers     287 Yes  my Lord  it will  said Jeronymo  if Mr  Grandison be the philosopher  If women were to be regimented  he would carry an army into the field without beat of drum   I was vexed to find an affair that had penetrated my heart  go off so lightly  but the levity shewn by the General was followed by Jeronymo  in order to make the past warmth between us forgotten   I left the brothers together  As I passed through the salon  I had the pleasure of hearing  by a whisper from Camilla  that her young Lady was somewhat more composed for the operation she had yielded to   In the afternoon  the General made me a visit at my lodgings  He told me  he had taken amiss some things that had fallen from my mouth   I owned that I was at one time warm  but excused myself by his example   I urged him to promote my interest as to the proposed compromise  He gave me no encouragement  but took down my proposals in writing   He asked me  If my father were as tenacious in the article of religion as I was   I told him  That I had forborn to write any thing of the affair to my father   That  he said  was surprising  He had always apprehended  that a man who pretended to be strict in religion  be it what religion it would  should be uniform  He who could dispense with one duty  might with another   I answered  That having no view to address Lady Clementina  I had only given my father general accounts of the favour I had met with from a family so considerable  That it was but very lately that I had entertained any hopes at all  as he must know  That those hopes were allayed by my fears that the articles of religion and residence would be an insuperable obstacle  But that it was my resolution  in the same hour that I could have any prospect of succeeding  to   288 lay all before him  and I was sure of his approbation and consent to an alliance so answerable to the magnisicence of his own spirit   The General  at parting  with an haughty air  said  I take my leave  Chevalier  I suppose you will not be in haste to leave Bologna  I am extremely sensible of the indignity you have cast upon us all  I am  and swore—We shall not disgrace our sister and ourselves  by courting your acceptance of her  I understand  that Olivia is in Love with you too  These contentions for you may give you consequence with yourself  But Olivia is not a Clementina  You are in a country jealous of family honour  Ours is a first family in it  You know not what you have done  Sir   What you have said  my Lord
