passion  which is the pride of my soul       Even her voice  melodious as it is by nature  is softened when she addresses her happy Rivers       She comes to ask my attendance on her and my mother  they are going to pay a morning visit a few miles off       Adieu  tell the little Bell I kiss her hand   Your affectionate  ED  RIVERS     LETTER CCVI   206   To Captain FITZGERALD   Three o clock   WE are returned  and have met with an adventure  which I must tell you       About six miles from home  at the entrance of a small village  as I was riding very fast  a little before the chaise  a boy about four years old  beautiful as a Cupid  came out of a cottage on the right hand  and  running cross the road  fell almost under my horse s feet       I threw myself off in a moment  and snatching up the child  who was  however  unhurt  carried him to the house       I was met at the door by a young woman  plainly drest  but of a form uncommonly elegant  she had seen the child fall  and her terror for him was plainly marked in her countenance  she received him from me  pressed him to her bosom  and  without speaking  melted into tears       My mother and Emily had by this time reached the cottage  the humanity of both was too much interested to let them pass  they alighted  came into the house  and enquired about the child  with an air of tenderness which was not lost on the young person  whom we supposed his mother       She appeared about two and twenty  was handsome  with an air of the world  which the plainness of her dress could not hide  her countenance was pensive  with a mixture of sensibility which instantly prejudiced us all in her favor  her look seemed to say  she was unhappy  and that she deserved to be otherwise       Her manner was respectful  but easy and unconstrained  polite  without being servile  and she acknowledged the interest we all seemed to take in what related to her  in a manner that convinced us she deserved it       Though every thing about us  the extreme neatness  the elegant simplicity of her house and little garden  her own person  that of the child  both perfectly genteel  her politeness  her air of the world  in a cottage like that of the meanest laborer  tended to excite the most lively curiosity  neither good breeding  humanity  nor the respect due to those who appear unfortunate  would allow us to make any enquiries  we left the place full of this adventure  convinced of the merit  as well as unhappiness  of its fair inhabitant  and resolved to find out  if possible  whether her misfortunes were of a kind to be alleviated  and within our little power to alleviate       I will own to you  my dear Fitzgerald  I at that moment felt the smallness of my fortune  and I believe Emily had the same sensations  though her delicacy prevented her naming them to me  who have made her poor       We can talk of nothing but the stranger  and Emily is determined to call on her again to morrow  on pretence of enquiring after the health of the child       I tremble lest her story  for she certainly has one  should be such as  however it may entitle her to compassion  may make it impossible for Emily to shew it in the manner she seems to wish       Adieu   Your faithful  ED  RIVERS     LETTER CCVII   207   To Captain FITZGERALD   Bellfield  Oct  24   WE have been again at the cottage  and are more convinced than ever  that this amiable girl is not in the station in which she was born  we staid two hours  and varied the conversation in a manner which  in spite of her extreme modesty  made it impossible for her to avoid shewing she had been educated with uncommon care  her style is correct and elegant  her sentiments noble  yet unaffected  we talked of books  she said little on the subject  but that little shewed a taste which astonished us       Anxious as we are to know her true situation  in order  if she merits it  to endeavor to serve her  yet delicacy made it impossible for us to give the least hint of a curiosity which might make her suppose we entertained ideas to her prejudice       She seemed greatly affected with the humane concern Emily expressed for the child s danger yesterday  as well as with the polite and even affectionate manner in which she appeared to interest herself in all which related to her  Emily made her general offers of service with a timid kind of softness in her air  which seemed to speak rather a person asking a favor than wishing to confer an obligation       She thanked my sweet Emily with a look of surprize and gratitude to which it is not easy to do justice
