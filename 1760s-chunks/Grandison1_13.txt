you say  is great  The more inexcusable therefore is he for his niggardliness to his Welshwoman  On his fortune he presumes  It will procure him a too easy forgiveness from others of our Sex  But fortune without merit will never do with me  were the man a prince   You say that if a woman resolves not to marry till she finds herself addressed to by a man of strict virtue  she must be for ever single  If this be true  what wicked creatures are men  What a dreadful abuse of passions  given them for the noblest purposes  are they guilty of   I have a very high notion of the marriage state  I remember what my uncle once averred  That a woman out of wedlock is half useless to the end of her being  How indeed do the duties of a good Wife    28 of a good mother  and a worthy matron  well performed  dignify a woman  Let my aunt Selby s example  in her enlarged sphere  set against that of any single woman of like years moving in her narrow circle  testify the truth of the observation  My grandfather used to say  that families are little communities  that there are but few solid friendships out of them  and that they help to make up worthily  and to secure  the great community  of which they are so many miniatures   But yet it is my opinion  and I hope  that I never by my practice shall discredit it  that a woman who  with her eyes open  marries a profligate man  had  generally  much better remain single all her life  since it is very likely  that by such a step she defeats  as to herself  all the good ends of society  What a dreadful  what a presumptuous risque runs she  who marries a wicked man  even hoping to reclaim him  when she cannot be sure of keeping her own principles —Be not deceived  evil communication corrupts good manners  is a caution truly apostolical   The text you mention of the unbelieving husband being converted by the believing wife  respects  as I take it  the first ages of Christianity  and is an instruction to the converted wife to let her unconverted husband see in her behaviour to him  while he beheld her chaste conversation coupled with fear  the efficacy upon her own heart of the excellent doctrines she had embraced  It could not have in view the woman who  being single  chose a pagan husband in hopes of converting him  Nor can it give encourgement for a woman of virtue and religion to marry a profligate in hopes of reclaiming him  Who can touch pitch  and not be defiled   As to Mr  Fenwick  I am far from having a better opinion of him than I have of Mr  Greville  You know what is whispered of him  He has more decency however  He avows not free principles  as the   29 other does  But you must have observed how much he seems to enjoy the mad talk and free sentiments of the other  And that other always brightens up and rises in his freedoms and impiety  on Mr  Fenwick s sty applauses and encouraging countenance  In a word  Mr  Fenwick  not having the same lively things to say  nor so lively an air to carry them off  as Mr  Greville has  tho  he would be thought not to want sense  takes pains to shew that he has as corrupt an heart  If I thought anger would not give him consequence  I should hardly forbear to shew myself displeased  when he points by a leering eye  and by a broad smile  the free jest of the other  to the person present whom he thinks most apt to blush  as if for fear it should be lost  and still more  when on the mantling cheek s shewing the sensibility of the person so insulted  he breaks out into a loud laugh  that she may not be able to recover herself   Surely these men must think us women egregious hypocrites  They must believe that we only affect modesty  and in our hearts approve of their freedom  For can it be supposed  that such as call themselves gentlemen  and who have had the education and opportunities that these two have had  would give themselves liberties of speech on purpose to affront us   I hope I shall find the London gentlemen more polite than these our neighbours of the Fox chace  And yet hitherto I have seen no great cause to prefer them to the others  But about the Court  and at the fashionable public places  I expect wonders  Pray Heaven  I may not be disappointed   Thank Miss Orme  in my name  for the kind wishes she sends me  Tell her  that her doubts of my affection for her are not just  and that I do really and indeed love her  Nor should she want the most explicit declarations of my Love  were I not more afraid of her in the character of a Sister to a truly respectable man  than doubtful of her in that of a friend to me    30 In which latter light  I even joy to consider her  But she is a little
