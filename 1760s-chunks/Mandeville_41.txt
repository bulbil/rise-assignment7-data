once received from Lady Belmont  in France  I have a strong suspicion Lord Melvin is intended for Lady Julia  I wish he might be agreeable to her  for her present passion is absolutely distraction        We go to morrow  when we come back you shall hear from me  or  perhaps  for I am something variable in my determinations  as soon as I get thither  Expect nothing however  if I do you the honor           1 212       you must set an immense value on my condescension  for I know we shall not have a moment to spare from amusements  Adieu   A  Wilmot      To George Mordaunt  Esq      I Have at length left Belmont  and left it certain of Lady Julia s tenderness  I am the happiest of mankind  she loves me  she confesses it  I have every thing to hope from time  fortune  perseverance  and the constancy of the most amiable of her sex        All cold reserve is banished from that charming bosom  above the meanness of suspicion  she believes my passion noble and disinterested as her own  she hears my vows with a pleasure which she cannot  nay which she does not wish to conceal  she suffers me to swear eternal tenderness    We dined on Wednesday at the hermitage           1 213       The company dispersed  the most delicate of women  not from coquetry  but that sweet impulsive modesty  not obvious  not obtrusive  which gives to beauty its loveliest charm  avoided an opportunity  which eager watchful love at last obtained  alone with her in those sweet shades    Oh  Mordaunt  let not the gross unloving libertine talk of pleasure  how tasteless are the false endearments  the treacherous arts of the venal wanton  to the sweet unaffected downcast eye of virgin innocence  the vivid glow of artless tenderness  the native vermilion of blushing sensibility  the genuine smile of undissembled love      I write this on the road to Lord T     s  where I shall be to night  I shall expect to hear from you immediately  Adieu     H  Mandeville           1 214         To Henry Mandeville  Esq   Mount Melvin  Thursday      I Never so strongly relish the happiness of my own manner of living  as when I compare it with that of others  I hear perpetual complaints abroad of the tediousness of life  and see in every face a certain weariness of themselves  from which I am so happy as to be perfectly free  I carry about me an innate disposition to be pleased  which is the source of continual pleasure        That I have escaped what is in general the fate of people of my rank  is chiefly owing to my fortunate choice in marriage  our mutual passion  the only foundation on which sensible souls can build happiness  has been kept alive by a delicacy of behaviour  an angel purity  in Lady Belmont           1 215       to which words cannot do justice  The transports of youthful passion yield its sweetness to the delight of that refined  yet animated sensation which my heart feels for her at this moment  I never leave her without regret  nor meet her without rapture  the lively rapture of love      By long experience mellowed into friendship       We have been married thirty years  There are people who think she was never handsome  yet to me she is all loveliness  I think no woman beautiful but as she resembles her  and even Julia s greatest charm  in my eye  is the likeness she has to her amiable mother        This tender  this exquisite affection  has diffused a spirit through our whole lives  and given a charm to the most common occurrences  a charm  to which the dulness          1 216       of apathy  and the fever of guilty passion  are equally strangers      The family where we are furnish a striking example of the impossibility of being happy without the soft union of hearts  Though both worthy people  having been joined by their parents  without that affection which can alone make so near a connexion supportable  their lives pass on in a tedious and insipid round  without taste for each other s conversation  they engage in a perpetual series of diversions  not to give relish to  but to exclude  those retired domestic hours  which are the most sprightly and animated of my life  they seek  by crowds and amusements  to fly from each other and from themselves        The great secret of human happiness  my dear Mr  Mandeville  consists in finding such constant employment for the mind  as
