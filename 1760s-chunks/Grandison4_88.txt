Dear creature  methinks I still feel her parting tears on my cheek   You charge me to be as minute  in the Letters I write to you  as I used to be to my friends here  And   220 you promised to be as circumstantial in yours  I will set you the example  Do you be sure to follow it   We baited at Stony Stratford  I was afraid how it would be  There were the two bold creatures  Mr  Greville  and Mr  Fenwick  ready to receive us  A handsome collation as at our setting out  so now  bespoke by them  was set on the table  How they came by their intelligence  nobody knows  We were all concerned to see them  They seemed half mad for joy  My cousin James had alighted to hand us out  but Mr  Greville was so earnest to offer his hand  that tho  my cousin was equally ready  I thought I could not deny to his solicitude for the poor favour  such a mark of civility  Besides  if I had  it would have been distinguishing him for more than a common neighbour  you know  Mr  Fenwick took the other hand  when I had stept out of the coach  and then  with so much pride  as made me ashamed of myself  they hurried me between them  thro  the innyard  and into the room they had engaged for us  blessing themselves  all the way  for my coming down Harriet Byron   I looked about as if for the dear friends I had parted with at Dunstable  This is not  thought I  so delightful an inn as they made that—Now they  thought I  are just got to Barnet  in their way to London  as we are here in ours to Northampton —But ah  where  where is Sir Charles Grandison at this time  And I sighed  But don t read this  and such strokes as this  to any body but Lord and Lady L —You won t  you say—Thank you  Charlotte —I will call you Charlotte  when I think of it  as you commanded me   The joy we had at Dunstable  was easy  serene  deep  full  as I may say  it was the joy of sensible people  But the joy here was made by the two gentlemen  mad  loud  and even noisy  They hardly were able to contain themselves  and my uncle  and cousin James  were forced to be loud  to be heard     221 Mr  Orme  good Mr  Orme  when we came near his park  was on the highway side  perhaps near the very spot where he stood to see me pass to London so many weeks ago—Poor man —When I first saw him  which was before the coach came near  for I looked out only  as thinking I would mark the place where I last beheld him  he looked with so disconsolate an air  and so fixed  that I compassionately said to myself  Surely the worthy man has not been there ever since   I twitched the string just in time  The coach stopt  Mr  Orme  said I  How do you  Well  I hope —How does Miss Orme   I had my hand on the coach door  He snatched it  It was not an unwilling hand  He pressed it with his lips  God be praised  said he  with a countenance  O how altered for the better   for permitting me once more to behold that face—that angelic face  he said   God bless you  Mr  Orme  said I  I am glad to see you  Adieu   The coach drove on  Poor Mr  Orme  said my aunt   Mr  Orme  Lucy  said I  don t look so ill as you wrote he was   His joy to see you  said she—But Mr  Orme is in a declining way   Mr  Greville  on the coach stopping  rode back just as it was going on again—And with a loud laugh—How the d—l came Orme to know of your coming  madam —Poor fellow  It was very kind of you to stop your coach to speak to the statue  And he laughed again —Nonsensical  At what   My grandmamma Shirley  dearest of parents  her youth  as she was pleased to say  renewed by the expectation of so soon seeing her darling child  came  as my aunt told us  you know  on Thursday night to Selby house  to charge her and Lucy with her blessing to me  and resolving to stay there to receive me  Our beloved Nancy was also to be there  so were   222 two other cousins  Kitty and Patty Holles  good young creatures  who  in my absence  had attended my grandmamma at every convenient opportunity  and whom I also found here   When we came within sight of this house  Now  Harriet  said Lucy  I see the same kind of emotions beginning to arise in your face and bosom  as Lady G  told us you shewed when you first saw your aunt at Dunstable  My grandmamma  said I  I
