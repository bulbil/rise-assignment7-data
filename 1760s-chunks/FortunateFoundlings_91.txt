 but  dear as she was to him  his   love and admiration of the king of Sweden  joined to the ambition of   desiring still more than he had received  kept him from entertaining the   least desire of quitting the service he was in       In eight or nine weeks did the two kings clear the country round  and   drove their enemies into the heart of Lithuania  As they were about to   return  they were met by the welcome news that general Renchild had been   no less successful  and entirely routed the whole army of Shullenburgh    and also that the diet of Ratisbon  fearing the king of Sweden would   enter Germany  had come to a resolution to declare him an enemy to the   empire  in case he offered to pass the Oder with his army       They could not have taken a more effectual step to bring on what   they dreaded  than by daring him to it by this menace  He took but   little time for consideration  before he determined to carry the war   into Saxony  and drive Augustus from his electorate  as he had done from   his kingdom       He had no sooner made known his resolution  than the troops began to   march  and with a chearfulness and alacrity  which shewed they had no   will but that of their king   indeed he seemed the soul of this mighty   body  of which every single man was a member  and actuated only by him       It is certain his heart was set on establishing Stanislaus on the   throne  and he knew no better way of preventing Augustus from molesting   him  than by calling off all communication between his electorate and   Poland   accordingly he bent his course to Saxony  marched thro  Silesia   and Lusatia  plundered the open country  laid the rich city of Leipsic    and other towns  under contribution  and at length encamped at   Alranstadt  near the plains of Lutsen  whence he sent to the estates of   Saxony  to give him an estimate of what they could supply  and obliged   them to levy whatever sums he had occasion for  not that he had the   least spark of avarice in his nature  but his hatred to Augustus  who   had by his injustice made him become his enemy  was so great  that it   extended to all those of his country  so far  as to humble and   impoverish the once opulent inhabitants  making them not only support   his numerous army  but laid on them besides many unnecessary imposts    which he divided among his soldiers  so that they were all cloathed in   gold and silver  and every private man had the appearance of a general    the king himself still preferring his usual plainness  but he loved  he   said  to see the Saxon riches upon Swedish backs       Horatio had now a second opportunity of writing to France  which he did   not fail to do  and  as there was no talk of the army decamping for some   time  let his friends know he hoped to hear from them at Alranstadt       Augustus  in the mean time deprived of every thing  and a wanderer in   that kingdom where he had lately reigned  sent a mean submission to him    entreating peace  and that he might have leave to return to his   electorate  This was granted by the conqueror  on condition he would   renounce  for ever  all thoughts of re entering Poland  or giving any   disturbance to Stanislaus  But as the treaty was going to be signed  the   czar sent an army of 20 000 men to his relief  who defeated general   Mayerfield  whom the king had left to guard that kingdom  and the   dethroned monarch once more entered Warsaw  the capital of Poland    in triumph       Charles XII  was so exasperated when he received this intelligence  that   he gave immediate orders to decamp  resolving he should not long enjoy   the benefit of his breach of faith  but the pusillanimity of Augustus   prevented him  that prince was afraid the czar should discover the peace   he had been secretly negotiating  and withdraw his troups  and as he had   neither any of his own  nor money to assist him  he sent the articles   demanded of him by the king of Sweden  signed with his own hand  and set   out to Alranstadt  hoping  by his presence and persuasions  to mollify   his indignation  and be permitted to enjoy his own Saxony in peace       What more could the utmost ambition of man require than the king of   Sweden now received  to see a prince  so lately his equal and inveterate   enemy  come to
