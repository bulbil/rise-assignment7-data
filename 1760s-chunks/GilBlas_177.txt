union  so happy and sentimental  was not long to be the lot of humanity  a pleurisy carried off my dear Colifichini   At this passage in her history  I interrupted my mother  Heyday l madam  your third husband dispatched already  You must he a most deadly taking  What do you mean  answered she  is it for me to dispute the will of heaven  and lengthen the days parcelled out to every son of earth  If I have lost three husbands  it was none of my fault  Two of them cost me many a salt tear  If I buried any with dry eyes  it was the attorney  As that was merely a match of interest  I was easily reconciled to the loss of him  But to return to Colifichini  I was going to tell you  that some months after his death  I had a mind to go and take possession of a country house near Palermo  which he had settled on me as a jointure  by our marriage contract  I took my passage for Sicily with my daughter  but we were taken on the voyage by Algerine corsairs  This city was our destination  Happily for us  you happened to he at the market where we were put up for sale  Had it been otherwise  we must have fallen into the hands of some barbarian purchaser  who would have used us ill  and we probably might have passed our whole life in slavery  nor would you ever have heard of us   Such was my mother s story  To return to my own  gentlemen  I gave her the best apartment in my house  with the liberty of living after her own fashion  which was a circumstance very agreeable to her taste  She had a confirmed habit of loving  brought to such a system by so many repeated experiments  that it was impossible for her to do without either a gallant or a husband  At first she looked with favour on some of my slaves  but Hali Pegelin  a Greek renegado  who sometimes came and called upon us  soon drew all her glances on himself  She conceived a stronger passion for him than she had ever done for Colifichini  and such was her aptitude for pleasing the men  that she found the way to wind herself about the heart of this man also  I seemed as if unconscious of their good understanding  being then intent only on my return into Spain  The bashaw had already given me leave to fit out a vessel  for the purpose of sweeping the sea and committing acts of piracy  This armament was my sole object  Just a week before it was completed  I said to Lucinda  Madam  we shall take our leave of Algiers almost immediately  so that you will bid a long farewell to an abode which you cannot but detest   My mother turned pale at these words  and stood silent and motionless  My surprise was extreme  What do I see  said I to her  whence comes it that you present such an image of terror and despair  My design was to fill you with transport  but the effect of my intelligence seems only to overwhelm you with affliction  I thought to have been thanked for my welcome news  and hastened with eagerness to tell you that all is ready for our departure  Are you no longer in the mind to go back into Spain  No  my son  Spain no longer has any charms for me  answered my mother  It has been the scene of all my sorrows  and I have turned my back on it for ever  What do I hear  exclaimed I in an agony  Ah  tell me rather  that it is a fatal passion which alienates you from your native country  Just heavens  what a change  When you landed here  every object that met your eyes was hateful to them  but Hali Pegelin has given another colour to your fancy  I do not deny it  replied Lucinda  I love that renegado  and mean to take him for my fourth husband  What an idea  interrupted I with horror  you  to marry a Mussulman  You forget yourself to be a Christian  or rather have hitherto been one only in name and not in heart  Ah  my dear mother  what a futurity do you present to my imagination  You are running headlong to your eternal ruin  You are going to do voluntarily  and from impure motives  what I have only done under the pressure of necessity   I urged many other arguments in the same strain  to turn her aside from her purpose  but all my eloquence was wasted  she had made up her mind to her future destiny  Not satisfied with following the bent of her base inclinations  and leaving her son to go and live with this renegado  she had even formed a design to settle Beatrice in her own family  This I opposed with all my might and main  Ah  wretched Lucinda  said I  if nothing is capable of keeping you within the limits of your duty  at least rush on perdition alone  confine with in yourself the fury which possesses you  cast not a young innocent headlong over a precipice  though you yourself may venture on the leap
