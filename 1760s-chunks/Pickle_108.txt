ready drawn  in order  to repeat the murder  in case the barber should commit the same mistake   Yet so tamed are those poor people to subjection  that when Peregrine  mentioned this assassination to his own trimmer  with expressions of    6 22 15  3 45 PM   horror and detestation  the infatuated wretch replied  that without  all doubt it was a misfortune  but it proceeded from the gentleman s  passion  and observed  by way of encomium on the government  that such  vivacity is never punished in France   A few days after this outrage was committed  our youth  who was a  professed enemy to all oppression  being in one of the first loges  at the comedy  was eye witness of an adventure which filled him with  indignation  a tall  ferocious fellow  in the parterre  without the  least provocation  but prompted by the mere wantonness of pride  took  hold of the hat of a very decent young man who happened to stand before  him  and twirled it round upon his head  The party thus offended turned  to his aggressor  and civilly asked the reason of such treatment  but  he received no answer  and when he looked the other way  the insult  was repeated  upon which he expressed his resentment as became a man of  spirit  and desired the offender to walk out with him  No sooner did  he thus signify his intention  than his adversary  swelling with rage   cocked his hat fiercely in his face  and  fixing his hands in his sides   pronounced  with the most imperious tone   Hark ye  Mr  Round Periwig   you must know that I am a mousquetaire   Scarce had this awful word  escaped from his lips  when the blood forsook the lips of the poor  challenger  who  with the most abject submission  begged pardon for  his presumption  and with difficulty obtained it  on condition that he  should immediately quit the place  Having thus exercised his authority   he turned to one of his companions  and  with an air of disdainful  ridicule  told him he was like to have had an affair with a bourgeois   adding  by way of heightening the irony   Egad  I believe he is a  physician    Our hero was so much shocked and irritated at this licentious behaviour   that he could not suppress his resentment  which he manifested by saying  to this Hector   Sir  a physician may be a man of honour   To this  remonstrance  which was delivered with a very significant countenance   the mousquetaire made no other reply  but that of echoing his assertion  with a loud laugh  in which he was joined by his confederates   Peregrine  glowing with resentment  called him a fanfaron  and withdrew  in expectation of being followed into the street  The other understood  the hint  and a rencounter must have ensued had not the officer of the  guard  who overheard what passed  prevented their meeting  by putting  the mousquetaire immediately under arrest  Our young gentleman waited at  the door of the parterre  until he was informed of this interposition   and then went home very much chagrined at his disappointment  for he was  an utter stranger to fear and diffidence on those occasions  and had set  his heart upon chastising the insolence of this bully  who had treated  him with such disrespect   This adventure was not so private but that it reached the ears of Mr   Jolter by the canal of some English gentlemen who were present when it  happened  and the governor  who entertained a most dreadful idea of  the mousquetaires  being alarmed at a quarrel  the consequence of which  might be fatal to his charge  waited on the British ambassador  and  begged he would take Peregrine under his immediate protection  His  excellency  having heard the circumstances of the dispute  sent one of  his gentlemen to invite the youth to dinner  and after having assured  him that he might depend upon his countenance and regard  represented  the rashness and impetuosity of his conduct so much to his conviction   that he promised to act more circumspectly for the future  and drop all    6 22 15  3 45 PM   thoughts of the mousquetaire from that moment   A few days after he had taken this laudable resolution  Pipes  who had  carried a billet to his mistress  informed him that he had perceived a  laced hat lying upon a marble slab in her apartment  and that when  she came out of her own chamber to receive the letter  she appeared in  manifest disorder  From these hints of intelligence our young gentleman  suspected  or rather made no doubt of  her infidelity  and being by this  time well nigh cloyed with possession  was not sorry to find she had  given him cause to renounce her correspondence  That he might therefore  detect her in the very breach of duty  and at the same time punish the  gallant who had the presumption to invade his territories
