there till the multitude was dispersed  and the darkness of   the evening might conceal his return  when in less than an hour he could   reach the palace       He sat down at the foot of the mountain Kabessed  without considering    that in this place he was most likely to be found  as those who travel   the desert seldom fail to enter the cave that winds its way under the   mountain  to drink of the water that issues there from a clear and   copious spring       He reviewed the scenes of the day that was now nearly passed  with a   mixture of astonishment and distress  to which no description can be   equal The sudden and amazing change that a few hours had made in his   situation  appeared like a wild and distressful dream  from which he   almost doubted whether he should not wake to the power and the felicity   that he had lost  He sat some time bewildered in the hurry and   multiplicity of his thoughts  and at length burst out into passionate   exclamations   What   says he   and where am I  Am I  indeed  HAMET    that son of Solyman who divided the dominion of Persia with his brother    and who possessed the love of ALMEIDA alone  Dreadful vicissitude  I am   now an outcast  friendless and forlorn  without an associate  and   without a dwelling  for me the cup of adversity overflows  and the last   dregs of sorrow have been wrung out for my portion  the powers not only   of the earth  but of the air  have combined against me  and how can I   stand alone before them  But is there no power that will interpose in my   behalf  If He  who is supreme  is good  I shall not perish  But   wherefore am I thus  Why should the desires of vice be accomplished by   superior powers  and why should superior powers be permitted to   disappoint the expectations of virtue  Yet let me not rashly question   the ways of Him  in whose balance the world is weighed  by Him  every   evil is rendered subservient to good  and by His wisdom  the happiness   of the whole is secured  Yet I am but a part only  and for a part only I   can feel  To me  what is that goodness of which I do not partake  In my   cup the gall is unmixed  and have I not  therefore  a right to complain    But what have I said  Let not the gloom that surrounds me  hide from me   the prospect of immortality  Shall not eternity atone for time    Eternity  to which the duration of ages is but as an atom to a world    Shall I not  when this momentary separation is past  again meet ALMEIDA   to part no more  and shall not a purer flame than burns upon the earth    unite us  Even at this moment  her mind  which not the frauds of sorcery   can taint or alienate  is mine  that pleasure which she reserved for me    cannot be taken by force  it is in the consent alone that it subsists    and from the joy that she feels  and from that only  proceeds the joy   she can bestow        With these reflections he soothed the anguish of his mind  till the   dreadful moment arrived  in which the power of the talisman took place    and the figure of ALMORAN was changed into that of HAMET  and the   figure of HAMET into that of ALMORAN       At the moment of transformation  HAMET was seized with a sudden languor    and his faculties were suspended as by the stroke of death  When he   recovered  his limbs still trembled  and his lips were parched with   thirst  he rose  therefore  and entering the cavern  at the mouth of   which he had been sitting  he stooped over the well to drink  but   glancing his eyes upon the water  he saw  with astonishment and horror    that it reflected  not his own countenance  but that of his brother  He   started back from the prodigy  and supporting himself against the side   of the rock  he stood some time like a statue  without the power of   recollection  but at length the thought suddenly rushed into his mind    that the same sorcery which had suspended his marriage  and driven him   from the throne was still practised against him  and that the change of   his figure to that of ALMORAN  was the effect of ALMORAN S having   assumed his likeness  to obtain  in this disguise  whatever ALMEIDA   could bestow  This thought  like a whirlwind of the desert  totally   subverted his mind  his
