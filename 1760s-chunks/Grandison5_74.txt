had such testimonies of her magnanimity  Permit me  my Lord  to say  that I have one good quality  I can admire goodness or greatness where ever I meet with it  and whether it makes for me  or against me  Clementina has all my reverence   He made me compliments  and withdrew   The Marquis  the Count  and the Marchioness  afterwards joined me in the garden  The Bishop and Father Marescotti not coming with them  or presently after them  I doubted not but they went to Clementina  in order to applaud her for  and confirm her in  a resolution  which must be agreeable to them  I was right in my conjecture   The Marquis and Count each took my hand  and first expressed their surprize at the young Lady s adherence to her resolution  and next their high value of me  The Marchioness observed     that her daughter  with all her excellencies  was ever difficult of persuasion  when she had deliberately resolved upon any point      Page  185 It was easy  I said  to see  that they all now were of one opinion  which was  that Lady Clementina was not to be moved from her present purpose   They owned they were  But said  that if it were not mine  they thought themselves bound in honour to consent  that I should try  by generous means  and they were sure I would not think of any other  to prevail upon her in my favour   I presume  said I  that the Bishop has already acquainted you with the substance of what passed just now  between Lady Clementina and me   They were silent   Has not your Ladyship seen Lady Clementina since   I have  And she is extremely uneasy  She wishes you could be of our religion  Could it have been so  I  for my part  should rather have called the Chevalier Grandison my son  than any man in the world  Clementina told me  added she  I cannot but say with more composure than I could have expected tho  not without tears  that you promised to urge her no more on this subject  She owns  that more than once  as you talked to her  she could hardly forbear giving you her hand  on your own terms  But she says  that you were the most generous of men  when you saw she made a point of conscience of her adherence to her newly taken resolution  And now  Chevalier  having made my Lord and the Count acquainted with all these things  we are come to advise with you what is to be done   Dear Grandison  said the Marquis  advise us  We want an opportunity to shew you  in more than words  our gratitude for all your goodness to us  We want to appease our Jeronymo  who is ready to suspect  that his Brother and Father Marescotti have contributed to this turn in our daughter s mind  And we want you to declare freely your own sentiments  with regard to Clementina  and whether you would advise us  as well for her own sake  as for yours  to endeavour Page  186 to prevail on her to change her mind  Dear creature  a relapse would now be fatal to her  and to her mother and me   I have no difficulty  my Lord  to answer to these points  As to the first  I am greatly rewarded by the pleasure I have  in the more than could be hoped for happy effects of Mr  Lowther s skill  and in the prospects that open to us of Lady Clementina s restored health of mind  On this subject I have but one request to make  It is that you will not mortify me so much  as to suppose  that I am not sufficiently rewarded   As to appeasing the generous mind of Signor Jeronymo  let that task be Lady Clementina s  She can plead conscience with more force for herself  than any second person can do for her  and if she does  it will be a demonstration to us all  of her being likely to be happy in her perseverance —More happy than I shall be  The admirable Lady who has silenced  on this head  a man so deeply interested to contest this point with her  will certainly be able to appease a brother by the same pleas  and the sooner  as  being of the same religion with the lovely pleader  her arguments will have greater force with him  than they could be supposed to have on me  For  let me say  my Lord  that I could not so much as seem to give way to them  had I not been accustomed  when I was to judge of another s actions  to suppose myself that very person  Hence have I often thought myself obliged to give judgement against my own wishes  though  on resumeing MYSELF  I have not found reason to disapprove of my first expectation   As to the third point  what can I say —And yet  as your Lordship has put it  does it not call upon me  as I may say  to give a proof of the disinterestedness I have mentioned
