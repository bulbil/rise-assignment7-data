that afternoon to the house of a lady of   quality  where a great concourse of the best company usually as    sembled on set invitations  to spend the evening at the favourite    amusement of cards  The lady of the house was one of those          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 183     children of fortvme  who rise by the means that ruin thousands  In   her early youth  she had sacrificed her virtue to vanity  and yielded   to the loose desires of the nobleman she was now married to  over   whom her humble obliging temper  and particularly her complaisant   blindness to his other amours  gained her such an ascendency  that   in a fit of uncommon fondness  he made her his wife  But the   method he took to secure himself the ease and conveniences he   enjoyed with her  directly overturned them   for her humility and   complaisance were all feigned  and the necessity of counterfeiting   them being thus removed  she immediately assumed all the import    ance of her new character  and exerted the usual prerogatives of   it in as high a manner as if she had never been in a meaner rank    The infatuated husband soon saw his error  but it was too late to   remedy it  He therefore is forced to compound with her for the   indulgence he desires  by submitting to let her gratify her passion   for vain pomp and expensive ceremony  under the parade of which   she strives to hide her obscure original  as she attempts to obhterate   the remembrance of her fall from virtue by a most rigid profession   of religion  Thus her routs are the most splendid  and difficult of   access  of any in the town  no person being invited but those of the   first rank  nor any who are not invited being admitted  be their   rank what it will   and she professes herself a strict follower of my   late master  in his most extravagant opinions  where they do not   immediately interfere with her own vanity      It is impossibe to convey any notion to you of such a scene as   this  to which my mistress carried me  it is so difierent from that   sphere in which you have acted  Suppose you see several hundred   people of both sexes and of every age  dressed in all the profusion   and elegance of expense  and wearing dissipation and happiness in   their looks  assembled together to spend the evening in mutual   entertainment  This is the face of the picture   but turn the re    verse  and you shall behold a set of people who have sacrificed their   real interest and the peace of their minda to the gratification of this   and such like pleasure  and who come purely to prey upon each   other  Accordingly  the whole is one continued scene of sharping    mutual distrust  envy  slander  and malevolence   the very few   who  like my mistress come there for mere amusement  and are   untainted with such vices  being forced to submit in seeming   acquiescence to the torrent they are not able to stem      In the course of the evening it was my fortune often to change   my service   but as the stay I made with my momentary possessors   was so very short  I shall waive giving any account of them  especi    ally as the two most remarkable of the set  and under whom all the   rest who launch out of the common road of life are in a great measure   characterised  have been sufficiently described on a former occasion    though the histories I read in many of their hearts would afford much   entertainment  and hasten to the lady in whose possession I left the   company      My new mistress was the young widow of a person of great dis    tinction  who  in the decline of life  had overlooked the disparity of   age and rank  and married her  solely to gratify his passion for her   beauty  During the few years he lived  his care and prudence         184 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     kept her indiscretion within bounds  but as soon as that guard was   removed  she plunged into all the fashionable follies of the times     with a keenness that courted ruin      But  though she eagerly followed every pursuit that bore the   name of pleasure  vanity was the ruling passion of her heart  The   rank into which her husband had lifted her placed her on a  level    in point of society  with the best company  and the fortune he left   her was sufficient to support that rank  But still  aa there were   many degrees above her  her heart pined
