 he sent for his ward and his friend   But  my good Miss Byron  you will say  That I have not yet fully answered your last enquiry  relating to the present situation of the unhappy Clementina   I will briefly inform you of it   When it was known  for certain  that Mr  Grandison had actually left Italy  the family at Bologna began to wish that they had permitted the interview so much desired by the poor Lady  And when they afterwards understood that he was sent for to England  to take possession of his paternal estate  that farther distance  the notion likewise of the seas between them appearing formidable  added to their regrets   The poor Lady was kept in travelling motion to quiet her mind  For still an interview with Mr  Grandison having never been granted  it was her first wish   They carried her to Urbino  to Rome  to Naples  then back to Florence  then to Milan  to Turin   Whether they made her hope that it was to meet with Mr  Grandison  I know not  but it is certain  she herself expected to see him at the end of every journey  and  while she was moving  was easier  and more composed  perhaps in that hope   The Marchioness was sometimes of the party  The air and exercise were thought proper for her health  as well as for that of her daughter  Her   373 cousin Laurana was always with her in these excursions  and sometimes Lady Sforza  and their escorte was  generally  Signors Sebastiano and Juliano   But  within these four months past  these journeyings have been discontinued  The young Lady accuses them of deluding her with vain hopes  She is impatient  and has made two attempts to escape from them   She is  for this reason  closely confined  and watched   They put her once into a nunnery  at the motion of Lady Sforza  as for a trial only  She was not uneasy in it  But this being done unknown to the General  when he was apprised of it  he  for reasons I cannot comprehend  was displeased  and had her taken out  directly   Her head runs more than ever upon seeing her tutor  her friend  her Chevalier  once more  They have certainly been to blame  if they have let her travel with such hopes  because they have thereby kept up her ardor for an interview  Could she but once more see him  she says  and let him know the cruelty she has been treated with  she should be satisfied  He would pity her  she is sure  tho  nobody else will   The Bishop has written to beg  that Sir Charles would pay them one more visit at Bologna   I will refer to my patron himself the communicating to you  Ladies  his resolution on this subject  I had but a moment s sight of the Letters which so greatly affected him   It is but within these few days past that this new request has been made to him in a direct manner  The question was before put  If such a request should be made  would he comply  And once Camilla wrote  as having heard Sir Charles s presence wished for   Mean time the poor Lady is hastening  they are afraid  into a consumptive malady  The Count of Belvedere  however  still adores her  The disorder   374 in her mind being imputed chiefly to religious melancholy  and some of her particular flights not being generally known  he  who is a pious man himself  pities her  and declares  that he would run all risques of her recovery  would the family give her to him  And yet he knows  that she would choose to be the wife of the Chevalier Grandison rather than that of any other man  were the article of religion to be got over  and generously applauds her for preferring her Faith to her Love   Signor Jeronymo is in a very bad way  Sir Charles often writes to him  and with an affection worthy of the merits of that dear friend  He was to undergo another severe operation on the next day after the Letters came from Bologna  the success of which was very doubtful   How nobly does Sir Charles appear to support himself under such heavy distresses  For those of his friends were ever his  But his heart bleeds in secret for them  A feeling heart is a blessing that no one  who has it  would be without  and it is a moral security of innocence  since the heart that is able to partake of the distress of another  cannot wilfully give it   I think  my good Miss Byron  that I have now  as far as I am present able  obeyed all your commands that concern the unhappy Clementina  and her family  I will defer  if you please those which relate to Olivia and Mrs  Beaumont  Ladies of very different characters from each other  having several Letters to write   Permit me  my good Ladies  and my Lord  after contributing so much to afflict your worthy hearts  to refer you  for relief under all the destresses
