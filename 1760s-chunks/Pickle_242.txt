be able to survive the shock of being deprived of him all at once    This address may seem very humble to an unconcerned observer  but love  will tame the proudest disposition  as plainly appeared in my case  for  I had naturally as much spirit  or more  than the generality of people  have  Mr  S   was so much confounded at the manner of my behaviour   that he scarce knew what answer to make  for  as he afterwards owned   he expected to hear himself upbraided  but he was not proof against my  tenderness  After some hesitation  he said  he never meant to forsake  me entirely  that his affection was still unimpaired  and that he would  follow me directly to London  I imposed upon myself  and believed what  he said  because I could not bear to think of parting with him for ever   and returned to town in a more tranquil state of mind than that in which    6 22 15  3 45 PM   I had left my father  though my heart was far from being at ease  my  fears being ingenious enough to foresee  that I should never be able to  overcome his indifference    I took lodgings in Mount street  and my maid having disposed of herself  in marriage  hired another  who supplied her place very much to my  satisfaction  She was a good girl  had a particular attachment to  me  and for many years  during which she lived in my service  was  indefatigably assiduous in contributing to my ease  or rather in  alleviating my affliction  For  though S   came up to town according to  promise  and renewed a sort of correspondence with me for the space of  five months  his complaisance would extend no farther  and he gave me  to understand  that he had determined to go abroad with Mr  V    whom he  accordingly accompanied in his envoying to D      I understood the real cause of this expedition  which  notwithstanding  his oaths and protestations of unabated love and regard  I construed  into a palpable mark of dislike and disrespect  nor could the repeated  assurances I received from him in letters mitigate the anguish and  mortification that preyed upon my heart  I therefore gave up all hopes  of recovering the happiness I had lost  I told him on the eve of his  departure  that he might exercise his gallantry a great while  before he  would meet with my fellow  in point of sincerity and love  for I would  rather have been a servant in his house  with the privilege of seeing  him  than the queen of England debarred of that pleasure    When he took his leave  and went down stairs  I shrunk at every step he  made  as if a new wound had been inflicted upon me and when I heard the  door shut behind him  my heart died within me  I had the satisfaction  to hear afterwards  he lamented the loss of me prodigiously  and that he  had never been so happy since  I sat down to write a letter  in which I  forgave his indifference  because I knew the affections are altogether  involuntary  and wished him all the happiness he deserved  I then walked  up and down the room in the most restless anxiety  was put to bed by my  maid  rose at six  mounted my horse and rode forty miles  in order to  fatigue myself that I might next night enjoy some repose  This exercise  I daily underwent for months together  and  when it did not answer my  purpose  I used to walk round Hyde park in the evening  when the place  was quite solitary and unvisited by any other human creature    In the course of this melancholy perambulation  I was one day accosted  by a very great man  who  after the first salutation  asked whether or  not my intercourse with S   was at an end  and if I had any allowance  from my husband  To the first of these questions I replied in the  affirmative  and to the last answered  that my lord did not allow me a  great deal  indeed  I might have truly said nothing at all  but I was  too proud to own my indigence  He then expressed his wonder  how one  like me  who had been used to splendour and affluence from my cradle   could make shift to live in my present narrow circumstances  and  when I  told him that I could make a very good shift  so I had peace  he seemed  to lament my situation  and very kindly invited me to sup with his wife  at his house  I accepted the invitation  without any apprehension of  the consequence  and  when I went to the place  was introduced into an  apartment magnificently lighted up  I suppose  for my reception    After I had stayed alone for some time in this mysterious situation   without seeing a living soul  my inviter appeared
