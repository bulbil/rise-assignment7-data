the new occupation at which he aspired   I understand   said he   that you are desirous of treading the paths of errantry  which  I assure you  are thorny and troublesome  Nevertheless  as your purpose is to exercise your humanity and benevolence  so your ambition is commendable  But towards the practice of chivalry  there is something more required than the virtues of courage and generosity  A knight errant ought to understand the sciences  to be master of ethics or morality  to be well versed in theology  a complete casuist  and minutely acquainted with the laws of his country  He should not only be patient of cold  hunger  and fatigue  righteous  just  and valiant  but also chaste  religious  temperate  polite  and conversable  and have all his passions under the rein  except love  whose empire he should submissively acknowledge   He said  this was the very essence of chivalry  and no man had ever made such a profession of arms  without first having placed his affection upon some beauteous object  for whose honour  and at whose command  he would cheerfully encounter the most dreadful perils   He took notice  that nothing could be more irregular than the manner in which Crowe had attempted to keep his vigil  For he had never served his novitiate—he had not prepared himself with abstinence and prayer—he had not provided a qualified godfather for the ceremony of dubbing—he had no armour of his own to wake  but  on the very threshold of chivalry  which is the perfection of justice  had unjustly purloined the arms of another knight  That this was a mere mockery of a religious institution  and therefore unpleasing in the sight of Heaven  witness the demons and hobgoblins that were permitted to disturb and torment him in his trial   Crowe having listened to these remarks with earnest attention  replied  after some hesitation   I am bound to you  brother  for your kind and Christian counsel—I doubt as how I ve steered by a wrong chart  d ye see—as for the matter of the sciences  to be sure  I know Plain Sailing and Mercator  and am an indifferent good seaman  thof I say it that should not say it  But as to all the rest  no better than the viol block or the geer capstan  Religion I han t much overhauled  and we tars laugh at your polite conversation  thof  mayhap  we can chaunt a few ballads to keep the hands awake in the night watch  then for chastity  brother  I doubt that s not expected in a sailor just come ashore  after a long voyage—sure all those poor hearts won t be d—ned for steering in the wake of nature  As for a sweetheart  Bet Mizen of St  Catherine s would fit me to a hair—she and I are old messmates  and what signifies talking  brother  she knows already the trim of my vessel  d ye see   He concluded with saying  he thought he wa n t too old to learn  and if Sir Launcelot would take him in tow as his tender  he would stand by him all weathers  and it should not cost his consort a farthing s expense   The knight said  he did not think himself of consequence enough to have such a pupil  but should always be ready to give him his best advice  as a specimen of which  he exhorted him to weigh all the circumstances  and deliberate calmly and leisurely  before he actually engaged in such a boisterous profession  assuring him  that if  at the end of three months  his resolution should continue  he would take upon himself the office of his instructor  In the meantime he gratified the hostess for his lodging  put on his armour  took leave of the company  and  mounting Bronzomarte  proceeded southerly  being attended by his squire Crabshaw  grumbling  on the back of Gilbert             CHAPTER EIGHT  WHICH IS WITHIN A HAIR S BREADTH OF PROVING HIGHLY INTERESTING   Leaving Captain Crowe and his nephew for the present  though they  and even the misanthrope  will reappear in due season  we are now obliged to attend the progress of the knight  who proceeded in a southerly direction  insensible of the storm that blew  as well as of the darkness  which was horrible  For some time  Crabshaw ejaculated curses in silence  till at length his anger gave way to his fear  which waxed so strong upon him  that he could no longer resist the desire of alleviating it  by entering into a conversation with his master  By way of introduction  he gave Gilbert the spur  directing him towards the flank of Bronzomarte  which he encountered with such a shock  that the knight was almost dismounted   When Sir Launcelot  with some warmth  asked the reason of this attack  the squire replied in these words   The devil  God bless us  mun be playing his pranks with Gilbert too  as sure as I m a living soul—I se wager a teaster  the foul fiend has left the seaman  and got into Gilbert  that he has—when a has passed through an ass and a horse  I se marvel
