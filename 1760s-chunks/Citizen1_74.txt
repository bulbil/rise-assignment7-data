way to make the audience laugh is by first laughing yourself  so in writing  the properest manner is to shew an attempt at humour  which will pass upon most for humour in reality  To effect this  readers must be treated with the most perfect familiarity  in one  the author is to make them a low bow  and in the next to pull them by the nose  he must talk in riddles  and then send them to bed in order to dream for the solution  He must speak of himself and his chapters  and his manner  and what he would be at  and his own importance  and his mother s importance with the most unpitying prolixity  Now and then testifying his contempt for all but himself  smiling without a jest  and without wit possessing vivacity  Adieu   LETTER LII  From the same   THO  naturally pensive  yet I am fond of gay company  and take every opportunity of thus dismissing the mind from duty  From this motive I am often found in the centre of a crowd    234 and wherever pleasure is to be sold  am always a purchaser  In those places  without being remarked by any  I join in whatever goes forward  work my passions into a similitude of frivolous earnestness  shout as they shout  and condemn as they happen to disapprove  A mind thus sunk for a while below its natural standard  is qualified for stronger flights  as those first retire who would spring forward with greater vigour   Attracted by the serenity of the evening  my friend and I lately went to gaze upon the company in one of the public walks near the city  Here we sauntred together for some time  either praising the beauty of such as were handsome  or the dresses of such as had nothing else to recommend them  We had gone thus deliberately forward for some time  when stopping on a sudden  my friend caught me by the elbow  and led me out of the public walk  I could perceive by the quickness of his pace  and by his frequently looking behind  that he was attempting to avoid somebody who followed  we now turned to the right  then to the left  as we went forward he still went faster  but in vain  the person whom he attempted to escape  hunted us through every doubling  and gained upon us each moment  so that at last we fairly stood still  resolving to face what we could not avoid   Our pursuer soon came up  and joined us with all the familiarity of an old acquaintance  My dear Drybone  cries he  shaking my friend s hand  where have you been hiding this half a century  Positively I had fancied you were gone down to cultivate matrimony and your estate in the country   235 During the reply  I had an opportunity of surveying the appearance of our new companion  his hat was pinch d up with peculiar smartness  his looks were pale  thin  and sharp  round his neck he wore a broad black ribbon  and in his bosom a buckle studded with glass  his coat was trimmed with tarnish d twist  he wore by his side a sword with a black hilt  and his stockings of silk  though newly wash d  were grown yellow by long service  I was so much engaged with the peculiarity of his dress  that I attended only to the latter part of my friend s reply  in which he complimented Mr  Tibbs on the taste of his cloaths  and the bloom in his countenance  Psha  psha  Will  cried the figure  no more of that if you love me  you know I hate flattery  on my soul I do  and yet to be sure an intimacy with the great will improve one s appearance  and a course of venison will fatten  and yet faith I despise the great as much as you do  but there are a great many damn d honest fellows among them  and we must not quarrel with one half  because the other wants weeding  If they were all such as my lord Mudler  one of the most good natured creatures that ever squeezed a lemon  I should myself be among the number of their admirers  I was yesterday to dine at the Dutchess of Piccadilly s  My lord was there  Ned  says he to me  Ned  says he  I ll hold gold to silver I can tell where you were poaching last night  Poaching my lord  says I  fai•h you have missed already  for I staid at home  and let the girls poach for me  That s my way  I take a fine woman as some animals do their prey  stand still  and swoop  they fall into my mouth   Ah  Tibbs  thou art an happy fellow  cried my companion with looks of infinite pity  I hope your   236 fortune is as much improved as your understanding in such company  Improved  reply d the other  You shall know —but l•t it go no further —a great secret—five hundred a year to begin with —My Lord s word of honour for it— His Lordship took me down in his own Chariot yesterday  and we had a tete a tete dinner in the country
