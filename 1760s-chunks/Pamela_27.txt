now I will give you an instance how much I am in Mr  Longman s   esteem also       I had lost my pen some how  and my paper being written out  I stepped   to Mr  Longman s  our steward s  office  to beg him to give me a pen   or two  and a sheet or two of paper  He said  Ay  that I will  my sweet   maiden  and gave me three pens  some wafers  a stick of wax  and twelve   sheets of paper  and coming from his desk  where he was writing  he   said  Let me have a word or two with you  my sweet little mistress   for   so these two good old gentlemen often call me  for I believe they love   me dearly   I hear bad news  that we are going to lose you  I hope it   is not true  Yes it is  sir  said I  but I was in hopes it would not be   known till I went away       What a d   l  said he  ails our master of late  I never saw such an   alteration in any man in my life  He is pleased with nobody as I see    and by what Mr  Jonathan tells me just now  he was quite out of the way   with you  What could you have done to him  tro   Only Mrs  Jervis is a   very good woman  or I should have feared she had been your enemy       No  said I  nothing like it  Mrs  Jervis is a just good woman  and    next to my father and mother  the best friend I have in the world  Well    then  said he  it must be worse  Shall I guess  You are too pretty  my   sweet mistress  and  may be  too virtuous  Ah  have I not hit it  No    good Mr  Longman  said I  don t think any thing amiss of my master  he   is cross and angry with me indeed  that s true  but I may have given   occasion for it  possibly  and because I am desirous to go to my father   and mother  rather than stay here  perhaps he may think me ungrateful    But  you know  sir  said I  that a father and mother s comfort is the   dearest thing to a good child that can be  Sweet excellence  said he    this becomes you  but I know the world and mankind too well  though I   must hear  and see  and say nothing  And so a blessing attend my little   sweeting  said he  wherever you go  And away went I with a courtesy and   thanks       Now this pleases one  my dear father and mother  to be so beloved   How   much better  by good fame and integrity  is it to get every one s good   word but one  than  by pleasing that one  to make every one else one s   enemy  and be an execrable creature besides  I am  etc                   LETTER XXIII         MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER       We had a great many neighbouring gentlemen  and their ladies  this day    at dinner  and my master made a fine entertainment for them  and Isaac    and Mr  Jonathan  and Benjamin  waited at table  And Isaac tells Mrs    Jervis  that the ladies will by and by come to see the house  and have   the curiosity to see me  for  it seems  they said to my master  when   the jokes flew about  Well  Mr  B      we understand you have a   servant maid  who is the greatest beauty in the county  and we promise   ourselves to see her before we go       The wench is well enough  said he  but no such beauty as you talk of    I ll assure ye  She was my mother s waiting maid  who  on her death bed    engaged me to be kind to her  She is young  and every thing is pretty   that is young       Ay  ay  said one of the ladies  that s true  but if your mother had not   recommended her so strongly  there is so much merit in beauty  that I   make no doubt such a fine gentleman would have wanted no inducement to   be kind to it       They all laughed at my master  And he  it seems  laughed for company
