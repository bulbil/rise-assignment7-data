of the mischiefs which I fear he has done to his temporal affairs  for his children’s sake as well as his own  but since he is delivered from the thraldom in which this woman held him  the rest  I hope  by future good management  may be retrieved  Would to heaven  I had nothing left me to lament  but the waste of his fortune  Sir George says he is sure he is deeply in debt  The law suit too I hear is likely to go against us  if that is to be the case  it will be a blow indeed   December 19  How miserable is a state of suspence  I am  if possible  more unhappy now  than when I was without hope of recovering my dear  and now more dear  because undone Mr Arnold  Our cause came to a final hearing many days ago  though I was not told it till this morning   and only prepared for it yesterday  and it is given against us  Mr Arnold by this stroke loses 900 pounds a year  besides considerable costs  Nothing now remains but my jointure  Into what an abyss of misery is my unfortunate husband plunged  Oh  that I could but see him  that I could but regain his confidence  that I might sooth and comfort him in his afflictions   My brother is very unkind  after telling me the fatal news  he said  he thought I should be much to blame if I returned to Mr Arnold  though he were even desirous of it  What prospect can you have with him but beggary  said he  for I suppose his next step will be to wheedle you out of your jointure  the only support you have now left for yourself and your children   Oh  brother  brother  said I  you have no heart  I could say no more  for I burst into tears   Perhaps you may not be put to the trial  answered he cruelly  but if you should  you are to take your own way Mrs Arnold  for my advice had never any weight with you or my mother   My mother replied  Sir George  you do not use either me or    your sister well  Let her  in the name of God  follow the dictates of her duty  If the unfortunate Mr Arnold sees his error  can you be so unchristian as to endeavour at steeling his wife’s heart against him  O son  this is not the way to obtain forgiveness of God for your own faults  Far be it from Sidney to reject the proffered love of a repenting husband  My dear  to me  don’t afflict yourself  if your husband has grace  you shall both be as happy together as I can make you  Misfortunes  said  Sir George  are mighty great promoters of grace  I don’t doubt but Mr Arnold will repent most heartily—the having lavished away his fortune  and the hopes of repairing it  may give him the grace to take his wife again   Sir George  said my mother angrily  you will oblige me if you say no more on the subject   I have done  Madam  said my brother  and took his leave   I had almost forgot to tell you by what means the widow Arnold carried her suit against us  You may remember I informed you she had at the beginning threatened to produce a witness  who could prove  that her late husband had been with her on a particular night  a very little time before his death  Who this witness was  had been kept an impenetrable secret  She did  however  produce him  when the cause came to be tried  and this witness proved to be Mrs Gerrarde’s brother  That very brother whom Mr Arnold had redeemed from a gaol and peril of hanging  This man it seems had been very intimate with her during her husband’s life time  while she was in a state of separation from him  but whether he was at all acquainted with the late Mr Arnold  we have no other testimony than his own  ’Tis however most certain  that she was suspected of an intrigue with him  and in all human probability that child  which is to inherit the Arnold estate  is his   This concealed villain undoubtedly was the person who first suggested this vile attempt to her  and secretly abetted her in all her proceedings  It was after the commencement of the law suit that he was put into gaol  and Mr Arnold little imagined  when under Mrs Gerrarde’s influence he obtained his liberty  that he was bestowing on this wicked wretch power to ruin him   I do not imagine Mrs Gerrarde was in this secret  I suppose she would not knowingly have contributed to beggar the man by whom she was supported in affluence  But be that as it will  the evidence of this fellow  who was bred an attorney  together with that of Mrs Arnold’s maid  established the proof on which the    issue of the whole affair turned   Unfortunately for us  we could find nobody capable of giving any testimony which could overthrow theirs  and the irregularity of the late Mr Arnold’s life gave these evidences an appearance at least of truth
