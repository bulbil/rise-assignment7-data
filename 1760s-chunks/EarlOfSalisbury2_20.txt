William must have perished  and this was delivered in a  tone and manner which indicated too plainly  that he felt a peculiar  pleafure in this persuasion  I was alarmed  I cautiously avoided all  farther explanation  and coldly assented to his opinion  but Hubert   naturally jealous  and practised in the arts and policy of courts   suspected my silence  He was sensible that I had suppressed some part of  my story  he treated me  with distance and reserve  and my suit sped but coldly  Frequently did I  remind him of the royal promise I had received  and urged him to issue  the orders necessary for enabling me to seek the pirate  I was long  tortured with delays   till  quite wearied out by the insincerity of a  minister  who interposed like a baleful cloud between me and the favour  of his prince  I sought a convenient hour  and once more kneeled to  young Henry  He graciously directed me to repair to the coast without  farther delay  and at the same time commanded that a vessel should be  there prepared  ready to receive and to acknowledge me commander  I  bowed  and kissed the royal hand  I collected my attendants —I met Lord  William     In a happy hour   replied the Earl — but  gentle Lord  be not diverted  from thy purpose  haste thou to the coast  I shall but visit my castle   and straight follow thee  if happily we may yet recover our noble  friend  Jacqueline shall receive us at our joyful return  and thank thee  for her father                  SECT  III     CHAUVIGNY prepared to answer  when their conference was suddenly  interrupted by the approach of a stranger  who  with gentle aspect and  deportment  addressed himself to Salisbury  and kindly congratulated  his sase return to England  The Earl beheld him with surprise tempered  with due courtesy  and  ere he could demand his name  the stranger  observed with earnestness that the dampy shades of night were  approaching fast  and pointing to a fair dwelling  which lay at some  small distance  invited the Lords to accept of residence and  refreshment under his roof   till morning   There   said he         shall your retinue be also entertained  and there shall Lord William  receive some pleasing intelligence from the castle of Salisbury         Without farther hesitation or enquiry  the Earl joyfully aceepted this  invitation  and  pressing forward as his host directed  entered a  goodly hall  which seemed decked and prepared for his hospitable  reception   Little did this Lord conceive of the danger which now awaited him  of  the desperate purposes of Raymond and his associates  and the secret  malignity of Hubert who for some time had entertained a design against  his life  and hesitated only about the mears of execution  Conscious of  the vengeance due to his own baseness and salsehood  and firmly  determined to prevent it  he revolved many different schemes of  destroying Earl William either by force or fraud  In the midst of such  bloody thoughts he was surprised by the arrival of a messenger from Lord  Raymond  who desired a private conference  Raymond and his wicked  minion had for some time been perplexed and confounded  The  intelligence of the three English men  whom they still kept under  restraint  was clear and explicit  they adhered invariably to their  first account  and frequently repeated their declarations with an  ingenuous appearance of truth  wondering that their Lord was not yet  arrived  On the other hand  Salisbury did not appear  no farther  intelligence was received  no discoveries made by those sent out to  watch his approach  In this suspence and uncertainty  Raymond  whose  mind was too violently agitated to suggest any calm and deliberate  counsels  and Grey  whose wiles seemed to be at length exhausted   concurred in the expediency of dispatching an emisfary to Lord Hubert   to inform him of their situation  and to desire his direction  Reginhald  was appointed for this purpose  and recommended as a person in whom  Hubert might confide  The Monk now appeared before him and delivered  his letters   having already received the dreadful intelligence that  William was now safe in the town of Marlborough   The piercing eye of  Hubert  long used to scan the countenances of men  and there to read  their thoughts  narrowly surveyed the aspect of Reginhald  and sormed  too just conceptions of his temper and disposition  He enquired  particularly into the measures his nephew had  pursued  and the Monk answered to his questions in such a manner  as  admitted Hubert to a thorough knowledge of his wicked heart  Fully  persuaded that he now had a proper instrument of his deadly purpose  he  dismissed the Monk for a while  and appointed an hour for a second  conference     The dark design he now meditated required still some farther assistance
