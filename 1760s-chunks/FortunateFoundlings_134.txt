     Monsieur du Plessis arrives at Paris  his reception from Dorilaus and   Louisa  the marriage of these lovers agreed upon        The innocent pleasure Louisa felt in picturing to herself the extacy   which du Plessis would be in at the receipt of her letter  was not a   flattering idea   to know she was in Paris  where  in all probability    she had come to seek him  and to have the intelligence of it from   herself  had all the effect on him that the most raptured fancy   can invent       His orders to madam d  Espargnes being punctually complied with  his   bills of exchange also came soon after to hand  and the little hurts he   had received from the robbers  as well as those of his mind  being   perfectly healed  he set out with a lover s expedition  and arrived in   Paris to the pleasing surprize of a sister who tenderly loved him  and   expected not this satisfaction of a long time       He took but one night s repose before he enquired concerning Dorilaus    and was told that he was a person of quality in England  but  on some   disgust he had received in his native country  was come to settle in   France  As Louisa was extremely admired  they told him also that he had   a very beautiful daughter  of whom he was extremely fond  This last   information gave not a little ease to the mind of him who heard it  and   dissipated those apprehensions which the high character they gave of   Dorilaus had  in spite of himself  excited in him  he now imagined that   as they were English  his Louisa might possibly have been acquainted   with the daughter of this gentleman in their own country  and meeting   her at Paris  might have put herself under her protection       Full of those impatiencies which are inseparable from a sincere passion    he borrowed his sister s chariot  and went to the Fauxbourg St    Germains  and being told one of the best houses in the place was that of   Dorilaus  he asked for mademoiselle Louisa  on which he was desired to   alight  and shewed into a handsome parlour while a servant went in to   inform her  after this  he was ushered up stairs into a room  the   furniture of which shewed the elegance of the owner s taste  but   accustomed to every thing that was great and magnificent  the gilded   scenes  the rich tapestry  the pictures  had no effect on him  till   casting his eyes on one that hung over the chimney  he found the exact   resemblance of the dear object never absent from his heart   It was   indeed the picture of Louisa  which her father  soon after her arrival    had caused to be drawn by one of the best painters at that time in   Paris  This sight gave him a double pleasure  because it  in some   measure  anticipated that of the original  and also convinced him that   she was not indifferent to the person she was with       He was fixed in contemplation on this delightful copy  when the original   appeared in all the advantages that jewels and rich dress could give   her   Tho  he loved her only for herself  and nothing could add to the   sincere respect his heart had always paid her  yet to see her so   different from what he expected  filled him with a surprize and a kind   of enforced awe  which hindered him from giving that loose to his   transports  which  after so long an absence  might have been very   excusable   and he could only say  my dear adorable Louisa  am I so   blessed to see you once more   She met his embrace half way  and   replied  monsieur du Plessis  heaven has given me all I had to wish in   restoring to me so faithful a friend   but come  continued she  permit   me to lead you to a father  who longs to embrace the protector of his   daughter s innocence  Your father  madam  cried he  yes  answered she    in seeking a lover at Paris I found a father  Dorilaus is my father   I   have acquainted him with all the particulars of our story  and  I   believe  the sincere affection I have for you will not be less pleasing   for receiving his sanction to it       With these words she took his hand and led him  all astonishment  into   an inner room where Dorilaus was sitting  who rose to meet him with the   greatest politeness  and which shewed that to be master of  it was not   necessary to be born in
