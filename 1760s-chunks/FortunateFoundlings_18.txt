appetite  and being now initiated into the family of   this lady  had no longer any care to take than to oblige her  a thing   not difficult  Melanthe being good natured  and strongly prepossessed in   favour of her new friend  for so she vouchsafed to call her  and to use   her accordingly       As a proof of it  she made her in a very short time the confident of her   dearest secrets  they were one day sitting together  when accidentally   some mention was made of the power of love  You are too young  Louisa    said Melanthe  to have experienced the wonderful effects of that passion   in yourself  and therefore cannot be expected to have much compassion   for what it can inflict on others       Indeed  madam  answered she  tho  I never have yet seen a man who gave   me a moment s pain on that score  yet I believe there are no emotions   whatever so strong as those of love  and that it is capable of   influencing people of the best sense to things which in their nature   they are most averse to       Well  my dear  resumed the other  since I find you have so just a notion   of it  I will confide in your discretion so far as to let you know  that   but for an ungrateful man  I had not looked on my native country as a   desart  and resolved to seek a cure for my ill treated and abused   tenderness in foreign parts       My quality  continued she  I need not inform you of  you have doubtless   heard that my family yields to few in antiquity  and that there is an   estate belonging to it sufficient to support the dignity of its title    but my father having many children  could not give very great portions   to the daughters  I was therefore disposed of  much against my   inclinations  to a nobleman  whom my unlucky charms had so much   captivated as to make him not only take me with no other dowry than my   cloaths and jewels  but also to settle a large jointure upon me  which    he being dead  I at present enjoy  I cannot say that all the obligations   he laid upon me could engage a reciprocal regard   I behaved with   indifference to him while living  and little lamented him when dead  not   that I was prepossessed in favour of any other man   my heart  entirely   free  was reserved to be the conquest of the too charming perfidious   Henricus  who arriving soon after my lord s decease  and bringing with   him all the accomplishments which every different court he had visited   could afford  join d to the most enchanting person nature ever formed    soon made me know I was not that insensible creature I had   thought myself       I happened to be at court when he came to kiss her majesty s hand on his   return  and whether it was that my eyes testified too much the   admiration this first sight of him struck me with  or that he really   discovered something more attractive in me than any lady in the presence   I know not  but he seemed to distinguish me in a particular manner  and   I heard him say to my lord G    n in a whisper  that I was the finest   woman he had ever seen  but what gave me more pleasure than even this   praise  was an agreement I heard made between him and the same lord to   go that evening to a raffle at mrs  C  rt s  r s  I was one of those who   had put in  tho  if I had not  I should certainly  have gone for a   second sight of him  who when he went out of the drawing room seemed to   have left me but half myself       In fine  I went  and had there wanted any thing to have entirely   vanquished me  my conqueror s manner of address had done it with a form   less agreeable   O Louisa  pursued she with a sigh  if you have never   seen or heard the charming Henricus  you can have no notion of what is   excellent in man  such flowing wit   such softness in his voice and   air   but there is no describing what he is  He seemed all transport at   meeting me there  among a number of ladies I alone engrossed him  he   scarce spoke to any other  and being so fortunate to win the raffle    which was a fine inlaid India cabinet  instead of sending it to his own   house  he privately ordered his servant to leave it at mine  lord G    n
