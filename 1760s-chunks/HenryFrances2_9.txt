does it very imperfectly  of which I shall give you two Instances  among many  He says    We are placed here  like a Centinel at his Post    c  and after going on  with a great deal of Common place  on that Head  concludes  from the supposed Analogy of human and divine Things  that Suicide must be a Page  32 Crime  But this is begging the Question  What Authority from Reason have we to say  that Man is placed here  as a Centinel  Or  what Certainty have we of this Analogy  In Metaphysics  indeed  we are obliged to give some Definitions of our Ideas  in order to help us to discourse intelligibly about them  but  in Reality  there may be no more Relation between the Things themselves  and our Ideas of them  than there is between Colours and Sounds  though a blind Man  to give us his Notion of Red  compared it to the Sound of a Trumpet  but yet  in true Philosophy  it comes as near the Sound of a Lute  And  indeed  the speculative Divines seem to me  generally  to reason  like this Man  with more Fancy than Logic     Another Piece of Reasoning  he makes use of  is this    That  though we cannot perceive any Relation  we are placed in  with Regard to this Life   as in some Instances may be the Case  which might make our Death a moral Evil  yet  perhaps  we may be appointed by God to influence some future Event  and so the Ends of Providence may be disappointed by one Man s Impatience   Now I think it extremely weak  perhaps impious  to imagine  that it can be in the Power of one Man  or Mankind united  to frustrate the least Scheme or Design of Providence  And a Thief  at the Gallows  may make use of such an Argument Page  33 with as much Reason as any body else  So that this Reasoning  by proving too much  proves nothing     Watts has  indeed  summed up all that has ever been said upon this Occasion  but  to tell the Truth  I never met with any thing satisfactory upon the Subject  which is owing to the cautious  but unfair Manner of arguing  upon this Head  used by the Divines  who  for Fear of giving the least Encouragement to desperate Men  will not admit of any Sort of Latitude in this Matter  Adieu   Henry   LETTER CXCI  FRANCES to HENRY   ON finding that my dear Harry s Letter had been opened before it came to my Hands  I began to apprehend that my Letters might have been intercepted  I know not how this Treatment affects you  but it has filled me with the highest Resentment  For sure it is the Extreme of Insolence and Cruelty to deprive us of the only Means left to soften the tedious  melancholy Hours of Absence  Nor can I believe that any Law  human or divine  has vested even a Parent with such a Power  What barbarous Tyranny then to assume it   Page  34I have often experienced the Uneasiness you mention  at reading any thing that pleased me when you was not with me  One finds but a vague Enjoyment in any Pleasure  unshared by the Person beloved   I think I have Reason to resent the Apology you make for writing upon Subjects above a tawdry Girl s Reflection  If you consider me in that Light  I must join with the World in condemning your Taste  But if  as you have flattered me  my Person has the least Share in your Affection  that you love my Mind  and would improve it  in order to render it capable of the highest Enjoyment  that of conversing with you  why need you make any Apology for taking the proper Method of rendering it worthy of your Regard  I have often told you  that no Subject can appear dull or abstruse to me  which you wrote on  Nay  I have gone farther  and sometimes fancied  that if you were to write in a Language I was wholly unacquainted with  I should certainly understand you  at least I am sure I should  if I was to hear and see you speak it   I have never met with any of Dr  Watts s Writings  but  from the Specimen you give  I take him to be a better Christian than Philosopher  Though I am sure there may be many stronger Arguments against Suicide  than those you quote from him  yet I am pleased at his Page  35 considering every Individual  though without visible Tye or Connection  as necessary to the Well being of the whole Species  for  as the Great Artificer made nothing in vain  the Wretch who finds not Happiness in his own Bosom  or in any outward Objects  may  from this Principle alone  conclude Self Murder to be a Crime   But  after all  what are all Arguments about this Matter  Only speculative Essays  For I am convinced  that no Person ever committed the Act  but an Atheist or a Madman  Then it would be in vain to reason
