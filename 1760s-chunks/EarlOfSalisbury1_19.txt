sword from the soldier who had seized it  and flew upon my  betrayer  but ere I could execute my just vengeance  his false heart was  pierced by another arm  My guard were at length wholly overpowered  a  few lay bleeding  the rest yielded their arms and were made prisoners   together with the wounded youth and his fair attendant almost expiring  with terror and astonishment     And now I learned from my deliverers some part of that distress  in  which I had involved the good Les Roches  and the danger which I had  escaped  Hear the story  as it was then  and afterwards unfolded  still  more clearly  The delay of our embarkation from the isle of Rh√® had  given the implacable Mal leon an opportunity of dispatching a messenger  to Lord Chauvigny  by whom he accused Les Roches  of practices against  his government  and of wresting from him a prisoner of so much  consequence as Salisbury  This Lord  fired at the supposed injury  offered to his friend  seized the castle of Les Roches  with the too  common violence of a neighbouring and more powerful Baron  and carried  off his only daughter  as a pledge for my surrender  if still in the  hands of Les Roches  or as a means of awakening my sense of honour and  gratitude  and thus obliging me to return  if already dismissed  Hence  the grief and confusion of the domesticks   at our arrival  and hence  the disorder of my friend  who  dreading my  impetuosity and well remembering how rashly I had resolved to deliver  myself to Count Mal leon  in order to gain his liberty  determined to  conceal from me the cause of this disorder  and to try what might be  effected by force of arms for the rescue of his daughter  D Aumont  with  whom he consulted  and to whom he spoke his fears of my precipitate  generosity  commended his resolution  and at he prepared for immediate  departure in order to collect his force  the false Frenchman proposed   that to himself should be committed the care of preventing me from  leaving the castle  in his absence How he abused this trust  thou haft  already heard  but heaven was pleased to make his treachery the means of  my preservation  Chauvigny who was still further informed of our  approach  and of the weakness of our retinue  determined to make  himself master both of mine  and of the person of my friend  and no  sooner had I departed from the castle  under the conduct of my  perfidious guide  than it was again seized by a force detached for that  purpose  whilst another body hastening to support their associates   accidentally encountred Les Roches  dispersed his followers  and were  only prevented from seizing him by the desperate valour of my seven  Englishmen  whose attendance he had required  and who now with  difficulty secured his retreat  A number of his followers thus  dispersed  fled with precipitate haste towards their private haunts  for  present security  and to collect new force for the deliverance of their  chief  and in their flight  proved my deliverers     They now submitted to my direction  and invited me to share their  fortune  and by my persuasion they dismissed the soldiers of Chauvigny   together with his wounded son  I embraced the youth at his departure   who seemed confounded and ashamed at the violence with which his father  pursued a stranger thus superior to revenge  His eyes were  turned on Jacqueline  whose looks and tears expressed all the anguish of  separation  But the daughter of my dearest friend was a treasure not to  be entrusted to the mercy of an enemy  and she was therefore detained  however reluctant  My deliverers  anxious for our security  conveyed us  with rapid speed to the fastness of an high and dreary mountain  where  an humble cottage received  and the kind offices of honest poverty  relieved us  And here  this maid  whose beauty created love and  reverence in the breast of every beholder  informed me freely of her  dangers and distress  Soon as she had been conveyed to the castle of  Poictiers  the young Chauvigny already no stranger to the charms of  Jacqueline  visited the fair prisoner  and endeavoured to allay her  sorrows  Beauty  when distressed  is doubly powerful  and when pity  unites with love  no heart can resist their impression  This the youth  experienced  His soul became totally subdued  nor could he conceal the  generous weakness  He pleaded  in all the most affecting accents of a  sincere and ardent passion  nor did he plead in vain  The maid  too  susceptible of tenderness  and too artless to conceal her sensibility   heard him with indulgence  approved his worth  nor frowned on his love   Yet still a greatness and elevation of soul  gave dignity to her female  softness  She demanded a strong  and to a lover a severe  proof of his  sincerity  Restore me to my father  said she  then speak thy
