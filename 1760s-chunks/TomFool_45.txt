indeed did I wish for any  I was just like a new celebrated Woman of Pleasure  every one wished to be in Company with me   As to the Woman of the Town  I visited all of them  and knew every Demirep  and fresh Face  and as it was not in my Power to be as generous to them as I had been  I resolved to be useful in helping them to several rich Bucks of my Acquaintance  who could not so conveniently have met together  had I not contrived it  I did it to serve my Friends  and looked upon it as a Point of Honour  so did the Girls  for tho  Prudes may say what they will  those Sort of Women have more Honour about them than People imagine  They   191always received me with open Arms  but a Man may be sick with Sweet meats  I was at last in that sickly Condition  which the modest Part of the female Sex have no Pity for   When I was tolerably well  an old Acquaintance of mine invited me down to his Country Seat for the Summer  This was a real Piece of Friendship  I told him so  when I consented to the Proposal  His Answer was  why  look ye  Borlace  you are a damn d droll Fellow  to be sure  and can keep it up as well as any Man in England  therefore you ll be quite in Character with me  for as the general Election is coming  such a Man as you among my Friends is worth a Thousand   Away we went  in tip top Spirits  Faith  I shan t tire you with the Tricks we played upon the Road  about our humming the Parsons  or frightening old Women  with telling them the French were landed  and our Fleets beat  nor alarming the Country Towns at Midnight  with crying Fire  It was indeed one of the highest Journies I ever travelled   After we had been some Time keeping open House  the Country Gentlemen came forty Miles round to see and   192hear me  I began to be so necessary to my Friend  for I could drink when he could not  and sing  he knew no Songs  and tell Stories  and he had no Humour  that at last he swore to me  as we sat over the Remains of a Bowl of Arrack  every one else had left us  it was about four o Clock in the Morning  he swore he would settle two hundred Pounds a Year upon me for Life  and make a Point of it  he swore  squeezing me heartily by the Hand at the same Time  that I was the cleverest Fellow in England  and should live independantly   But I was out of Luck  for it was but next Evening I gave Judgment against my Friend and Patron that was to be  about his holding a foul Card  He did hold it  to be sure  and I was half fuddled  and said he did  immediately he flung a Bottle at my Head  and ordered his Servants to turn me out of Doors  About four in the Morning I was set adrift  without a single Penny in my Pocket  or knowing where to raise one   However  I came to a Resolution to earn the Bread I should eat for the future  and let it be ever so mean an Employ  I was resolved to seek for a Livelihood  There were several Ways that I could   193maintain myself in  for  tis a very vulgar Error to say  a Gentleman is not brought up to any Thing   I was qualified as Coachman  or Cock feeder  or a Game keeper  or a Whipper in  or a riding Groom  but I could not get Business in any of those Employments  because those to whom I proffered myself  objected to my being a Gentleman  and I had no Body could give me a Character  at last  after having put myself into a proper Dress  I got myself hired to make Hay   In a Week s Time  I found a wonderful Alteration in myself for the better  in Respect of Health and Quiet  I fell asleep when Night came  without being obliged first to get drunk by way of Opiate  I waked next Morning neither sick  sorry  nor ashamed  by the bitter Remembrance of how much like a Madman I had behaved over Night  I soon lost a Hoarseness which long had plagued me  My Legs fell into their proper Shape  my Wind was mended  my Eyes ceased smarting  my Hands were steady at Breakfast Time  my Flesh grew firm  and I wanted no Wine and Bitters to make me eat my Dinner   Thus I liv d  Sir  for a whole Twelvemonth  employed in one Part or other   194of Country Business  till Providence conducted me to this House  it was fitting up for this Gentlewoman  I was Overseer of the Workmen  and since I am employed for her  Here we live retired  we have every Thing we wish for among ourselves  we have seen the World  and despise  heartily despise its Vices and Follies  and would not again be intoxicated with them  for more
