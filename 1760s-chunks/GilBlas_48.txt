lift  Holy Jacintha  replied Fabricio  it is enough for me to have been blessed with your pious notice  Twice have I been under this venerable roof with my master  Signor Manuel Ordonnez  governor of the hospital  Ah  just so  answered the lady chamberlain  I recollect  You are an old acquaintance  Well a day now  Your very belonging to Signor Ordonnez is enough to prove you a youth of merit and strict propriety  A servant is known by his place  and this lad could not have had a better sponsor  Come along with me  I will introduce you to Signor SÃ©dillo  I am sure he will be glad to engage a lad at your recommendation   We followed Dame Jacintha  The canon lived in the lower part of the house  in a comfortable suite of wainscotted apartments  She begged us to wait a moment in the anti chamber  while she went into the licentiate s room  After some private parley with him  merely that he might know what he was about  she came to tell us we might walk in  We kenned the old cripple  immersed in an elbow chair  with a pillow under his head  cushions under his arms  and his legs supported on a large stool  stuffed with down  We were no niggards of our bows as we advanced  and Fabricio  still taking the lead  not only repeated over again what he had said to the housekeeper  but set about extolling my merit  and expatiated in an especial manner on the honours I had gained in the schools under Doctor Godinez on all metaphysical questions  as if it was necessary for a prebendary s footman to be as learned as his master  However that might be  it served as a tub to the whale  Besides  Dame Jacintha did not look forbidding  and my surety received the following answer  Friend  I receive into my service the lad you recommend  I like him well enough  and as for his morals  they cannot be much amiss  since he presents himself under the wing of a domestic belonging to Signor Ordonnez   As soon as Fabricio saw me safe landed  he made a low bow to the prebendary  a still lower to the lady  and withdrew in high good humour  whispering in my ear that we should meet again  and that I had only to make good my footing  As soon as he had left the room  the licentiate inquired my name  why I had left my native place  and drew me on by his questions to relate my adventures before Dame Jacintha  They were both highly amused  above all by my last rencounter  Camilla and Don Raphael gave such play to their risible muscles  that I thought old chalkstone would have burst  for  as he laughed with all his might  so violent a cough laid hold of him  as went very near to have carried him off  His will was not made  What an alarm for the housekeeper  Trembling  distracted  off she flew to the good man s succour  and just like a nurse with a puking child  paddled about his forehead and tapped him on the back  Luckily it was a false alarm  the old gentleman left off coughing  and the housekeeper tormenting him  When it was over  I was for going on with my narrative  but Dame Jacintha  in awe of a second fit  set herself against it  She therefore took me with her out of the room to a ward robe  where  among several suits  was that of my predecessor  This I was to take  and leave my own in its room  which I was not sorry to see laid up safe  in the hope it might be of further use  After this  we went together to get dinner ready   I knew what I was about in the art of dressing meat  Dame Leonarda  with whom I had served my time  might have passed for a very decent plain cook  but a mere turnspit to dame Jacintha  The latter might almost have borne away the bell from the archbishop of Toledo s man  She was mistress of everything  gravy soups  of the most delicious texture and relish  and  for made dishes  she could season them up or soften them down to the most delicate or voluptuous palate  At dinner time we returned to his reverence s apartment  While I was arranging the grand concern close by his arm chair  the lady of all work crammed a napkin under the old boy s chin  and pinned it behind his back  Without losing a moment  in marched I with a stew  fit to be set before the first gourmand in Madrid  and two courses  to have tickled the gills of a viceroy  only that Dame Jacintha had touched the spice box with discretion  for fear of exasperating the gout  At the first glimpse of this goodly mess  my old master  whom I conceived to have lost the use of his limbs  made me to understand that his arms were exempted from the interdict He availed himself of their assistance  to get clear of his pillow and cushions  and proceeded gaily to the attack  His hand shook  to be sure  but somehow or other it contrived
