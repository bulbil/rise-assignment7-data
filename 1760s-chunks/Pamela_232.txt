 And how delighted   have I been  when the moving report I have made of a particular   distress  has augmented my good lady s first intentions in relief of it       This I recall with pleasure  because it is now  by the divine goodness    become my part to do those good things she was wont to do  And oh  let   me watch myself  that my prosperous state do not make me forget to look   up  with due thankfulness  to the Providence which has entrusted me   with the power  that so I may not incur a terrible woe by the abuse or   neglect of it       Forgive me these reflections  my dear parents  and let me have your   prayers  that I may not find my present happiness a snare to me  but   that I may consider  that more and more will be expected from me  in   proportion to the power given me  and that I may not so unworthily act    as if I believed I ought to set up my rest in my mean self  and think   nothing further to be done  with the opportunities put into my hand  by   the divine favour  and the best of men          Saturday  seven o clock in the evening       My master returned home to dinner  in compliment to me  though much   pressed to dine with Lady Jones  as he was  also  by Sir Simon  to dine   with him  But Mr  Peters could not conveniently provide a preacher for   his own church tomorrow morning  at so short a notice  Mr  Williams   being gone  as I said  to his new living  but believed he could for the   afternoon  and so he promised to give us his company to dinner  and to   read afternoon service  and this made my master invite all the rest  as   well as him  to dinner  and not to church  and he made them promise   to come  and told Mr  Peters  he would send his coach for him and his   family       Miss Darnford told him pleasantly  She would not come  unless he would   promise to let her be at his wedding  by which I find Mr  Peters has   kept the secret  as my master desired       He was pleased to give me an airing after dinner in the chariot  and   renewed his kind assurances to me  and  if possible  is kinder than   ever  This is sweetly comfortable to me  because it shews me he does not   repent of his condescensions to me  and it encourages me to look up to   him with more satisfaction of mind  and less doubtfulness       I begged leave to send a guinea to a poor body in the town  that I   heard  by Mrs  Jewkes  lay very ill  and was very destitute  He said    Send two  my dear  if you please  Said I  Sir  I will never do any thing   of this kind without letting you know what I do  He most generously   answered  I shall then  perhaps  have you do less good than you would   otherwise do  from a doubt of me  though  I hope  your discretion  and   my own temper  which is not avaricious  will make such doubt causeless       Now  my dear  continued he  I ll tell you how we will order this point    to avoid even the shadow of uneasiness on one side  or doubt on the   other       As to your father and mother  in the first place  they shall be quite   out of the question  for I have already determined in my mind about   them  and it is thus  They shall go down  if they and you think well of   it  to my little Kentish estate  which I once mentioned to you in such   a manner  as made you reject it with a nobleness of mind  that gave me   pain then  but pleasure since  There is a pretty little farm  and house    untenanted  upon that estate  and tolerably well stocked  and I will   further stock it for them  for such industrious folks won t know how   to live without some employment  And it shall be theirs for both their   lives  without paying any rent  and I will allow them 50l  per annum   besides  that they may keep up the stock  and be kind to any other of   their relations  without being beholden to you or me for small matters    and for greater  where needful  you shall always have it in your power   to accommodate them  for
