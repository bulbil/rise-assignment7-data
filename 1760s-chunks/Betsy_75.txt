may thank   Heaven  Madam  that our family happened to be in town  else I do not   know what mischief might have befallen you     Bless me   cried Miss   Betsy  and was going on  but the other interrupted her  saying  hastily    as she led her forward   Walk this way  my brother will tell you all     Miss Betsy then stopped short   What means all this   said she   Where   am I  pray  Miss  Who is your brother   To which the other replied  that   her brother was the Lord Viscount       and that he at present was the   owner of that house       The surprize Miss Betsy had been put in by this young lady s first   accosting her  was not at all dissipated by these words  but had now an   equal portion of curiosity added to it  she longed to know the meaning   of words  which at present seemed so mysterious to her  and with what   kind of mischief she had been threatened  that she readily accompanied   her young conductress into a magnificent parlour  at the upper end of   which sat the nobleman she had been told of   I am extremely happy     said he  as soon as he saw her enter   that Providence has put it in my   power to rescue so fine a lady  from the villainy contrived against   her        Miss Betsy replied  that she should always be thankful for any favours   conferred upon her  but desired to know of what nature they were  for   which she was indebted to his lordship  he then told her  that the   persons she had been with had the most base designs upon her  that he   had heard from a closet window  where he was sitting  two of them lay a   plot for carrying her off in a hackney coach  and added  that being   struck with horror at the foul intention  he had contrived  by the means   of his sister  to get her out of their power   For   said he   I know   one of them to be so bloody a villain  that had I gone out myself  I   must have fallen a sacrifice to their resentment        Miss Betsy was quite confounded  she knew not how to question the   veracity of a nobleman  who could have no view or interest to deceive   her  yet it was equally incongruous to her  that Mr  Bloomacre could   harbour any designs upon her of that sort his lordship mentioned  she   had several times been in company with that gentleman  and he had never   behaved towards her in a manner which could give her room to suspect he   had any dishonourable intentions towards her  but then  the treatment   she had received from the gentleman commoner at Oxford  reminded her    that men of an amorous complexion want only an opportunity to shew those   inclinations  which indolence  or perhaps indelicacy  prevents them from   attempting to gratify by assiduities and courtship       After having taken some little time to consider what she should say  she   replied that she was infinitely obliged to his lordship for the care he   took of her  but might very well be amazed to hear those gentlemen had   any ill designs upon her  two of whom were perfect strangers  and the   other often visited at the house where she was boarded  As for the   sending for a coach  she said it was by her own desire  if no chair   could be procured  and added  that if his lordship had no other reason   to apprehend any ill was meant to her  she could not  without injustice    forbear to clear up the mistake       Lord      was a little confounded at these words  but  soon recovering   himself  told her that she knew not the real character of the persons   she had been with  that Bloomacre was one of the greatest libertines in   the world  that  though she might agree to have a coach sent for  she   could not be sure to what place it would carry her  and that he heard   two of them  while the third was entertaining her  speak to each other   in a manner which convinced him the most villainous contrivance was   about to be practised on her       A loud knocking at the door now interrupted their discourse  both his   lordship and his sister seemed terribly alarmed  all the servants were   called  and charge given not to open the door upon any account  to bar   up the lower windows  and to give answers from those above  to whoever
