 she should  and when she came in to lay the cloth  Mrs  Jewkes perceived   it  and fell a rating at her most sadly  for she has too many faults   of her own  to suffer any of the like sort in any body else  if she can   help it  and she bid her get out of her sight  when we had supped  and   go to bed  to sleep off her liquor  before we came to bed  And so the   poor maid went muttering up stairs       About two hours after  which was near eleven o clock  Mrs  Jewkes and   I went up to go to bed  I pleasing myself with what a charming night I   should have  We locked both doors  and saw poor Nan  as I thought   but    oh   twas my abominable master  as you shall hear by and by   sitting   fast asleep  in an elbow chair  in a dark corner of the room  with her   apron thrown over her head and neck  And Mrs  Jewkes said  There is that   beast of a wench fast asleep  instead of being a bed  I knew  said she    she had taken a fine dose  I ll wake her  said I  No  don t  said she    let her sleep on  we shall he better without her  Ay  said I  so we   shall  but won t she get cold       Said she  I hope you have no writing to night  No  replied I  I will go   to bed with you  Mrs  Jewkes  Said she  I wonder what you can find to   write about so much  and am sure you have better conveniences of that   kind  and more paper than I am aware of  and I had intended to rummage   you  if my master had not come down  for I spied a broken tea cup with   ink  which gave me suspicion  but as he is come  let him look after you    if he will  and if you deceive him  it will be his own fault       All this time we were undressing ourselves  And I fetched a deep sigh    What do you sigh for  said she  I am thinking  Mrs  Jewkes  answered   I  what a sad life I live  and how hard is my lot  I am sure  the thief   that has robbed is much better off than I   bating the guilt  and I   should  I think  take it for a mercy  to be hanged out of the way    rather than live in these cruel apprehensions  So  being not sleepy  and   in a prattling vein  I began to give a little history of myself  as I   did  once before  to Mrs  Jervis  in this manner       Here  said I  were my poor honest parents  they took care to instill   good principles into my mind  till I was almost twelve years of age    and taught me to prefer goodness and poverty to the highest condition of   life  and they confirmed their lessons by their own practice  for they   were  of late years  remarkably poor  and always as remarkably honest    even to a proverb  for  As honest as goodman ANDREWS  was a byeword       Well then  said I  comes my late dear good lady  and takes a fancy to   me  and said  she would be the making of me  if I was a good girl  and   she put me to sing  to dance  to play on the spinnet  in order to divert   her melancholy hours  and also taught me all manner of fine needle work    but still this was her lesson  My good Pamela  be virtuous  and keep the   men at a distance  Well  so I was  I hope  and so I did  and yet  though   I say it  they all loved me and respected me  and would do any thing for   me  as if I was a gentlewoman       But  then  what comes next   Why  it pleased God to take my good lady    and then comes my master  And what says he   Why  in effect  it is  Be   not virtuous  Pamela       So here I have lived about sixteen years in virtue and reputation  and   all at once  when I come to know what is good  and what is evil  I must   renounce all the good  all the whole sixteen years  innocence  which    next to God s grace  I owed chiefly to my parents  and my lady
