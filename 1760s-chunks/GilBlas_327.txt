complaint  I am quite at your service to play second fiddle in all your laudable enterprises  but let us take especial care to conceal our good understanding  for fear your faithful  humble servant should be kicked out of doors  It will not be amiss  in my poor opinion  for you to affect an extreme antipathy against me  some good round of abuse would have a very pretty effect  you need not be nice  all the blackguard terms in the dictionary will come at your call  Nay  a box on the ear now and then  or a kick on the breech  will break no squares  on the contrary  the more you express your thorough dislike  the more Signor Balthasar will pin his faith upon my sleeve  My cue will be  apparently to avoid speaking to you if possible  In waiting at table  I shall perform my little attentions to you at arm s length  and whenever your honour may happen to be called over the coals by the shopmen  you must not take it amiss if I abuse you worse than a pick pocket   As plain as chalk from cheese  cried young Velasquez at this last hint  this is admirable  my friend  at your early age  it is uncommon to meet with such a talent for intrigue  I consider it as a most happy omen for my purpose  With such a performer to play up to me  I flatter myself the old codger will be pinched to the bone and left penniless  You really carry your good opinion of me beyond what my merit will justify  said I  some industry may fall to my share  but not such exalted genius  But I shall do my utmost  and if my honest endeavours fail  your candour most find excuses for my imbecility   It was not long before Gaspard had proof positive that I was to a hair s breadth the very man he wanted  and the following was precisely the first trick I played into his hand  Balthasar s strong box was in the good man s chamber  by his bed side  a sort of oratory  with a prayer book always lying upon it  Every time I looked that way  my eyes glistened with hope and pleasure  my heart chuckled over the very idea of what might happen  Fair  sweet  cruel box  will you for ever be coy to my addresses  May I never experience the heart felt delight of possessing all your charms for better  for worse  As I went into the room at pleasure  and only Gaspard was warned off the premises  it happened one day that I watched his father  The old gentleman  fancying himself unobserved of human eye  after having opened his treasury and closed it fast again  hid the key behind the hangings  I took an accurate observation of the place  and communicated the discovery to my young master  who said with an improving hug  Ah  my dear Scipio  what glorious news you bring  Our fortune is made  my dear fellow  I will furnish you with wax  you shall take the impression of the key  and then our business is done  There will be no difficulty in finding a benevolent locksmith in Cordova  where  to do the place justice  there are as many rogues as in any part of Spain   Well  but why  said I to Gaspard  do you want a false key  We may find our account in the proper one  Yes  answered he  but I am afraid lest my father  through mistrust or whim  should take a fancy to hiding it elsewhere  and the safest way is  to have one of our own  I commended his precaution  and falling in with all his principles  got ready for taking the impression of the key  this was effected one morning early  while my old master was paying a visit to Father Alexis  with whom he for the most part held very long conferences  I did not stop here  but availed myself of the key to open the strong box  wherein an ample range of large and small bags threw me into the most delightful perplexity imaginable  I did not know which to choose  there was such a family likeness among them  nevertheless  as the fear of being caught did not allow of any long deliberation  I laid hands  haphazard  on the largest  Then  locking the box carefully  and putting the key back again behind the hangings  I got away out of the chamber with my booty  and hid it under my bed  in a small closet where I lay   Having performed this exploit so successfully  I ran back as fast as my legs would carry me to young Velasquez  who was waiting at a house where he had given me notice to meet him  and his delight was extreme at the recital of what I had just done  He was so fully satisfied with me  as to lavish caresses without number  and to offer me thrice  in the fulness of his heart  half the contents of the bag  which I did thrice refuse  No  no  sir  said I  this first bag is yours and yours only  apply it to your own uses and occasions  I shall return
