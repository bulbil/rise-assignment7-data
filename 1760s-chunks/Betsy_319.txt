the immediate assistance of the person who had caused the extraordinary   emotions       Her fancy  indeed  strong as it was  had formed no visionary   appearance  it was the very identical Mr  Trueworth whom chance had   brought to make the discovery of a secret which  of all things in the   world  he had the least suspicion of       He was intimately acquainted with the person to whom the house adjoining   to that where Mrs  Munden lodged belonged  and  hearing where he was  on   his return from Oxfordshire  had come the evening before  intending to   pass a day or two with him in this agreeable recess       As he was never a friend to much sleeping  he rose that morning  and   went down into the garden before the greatest part of the family had   quitted their beds  he saw Mrs  Munden while at too great a distance to   know who she was  yet did her air and motion  as she walked  strike him   with something which made him willing to see what sort of face belonged   to so genteel a form  Drawing more near  his curiosity was gratified   with a sight he little expected  he was just about to accost her with   the salutation of the morning  when she went into the arbour  and seated   herself in the manner already described  The extreme pensiveness of her   mind had hindered her from perceiving that any one was near  but the   little covert under which she was placed being open on both sides  he   had a full view of every thing she did  Though she was in the most   negligent night dress that could be  she seemed as lovely to him as   ever  all his first flames rekindled in his heart  while gazing on her   with this uninterrupted freedom  he longed to speak to her  but durst   not  lest  by doing so  he should be deprived of the pleasure he now   enjoyed  till  observing she had something in her hand which she seemed   to look upon with great attention  and sometimes betrayed agitations he   had never seen in her before  he was impatient to discover  if possible    the motive  he therefore advanced as gently as he could towards the back   of the arbour  which having no wood work  and the leafy canopy only   supported by ozier boughs placed at a good distance from each other  he   had a full opportunity of beholding all that the reader has been told    But what was his amazement to find it was his own picture   that very   picture  which had been taken from the painter s  was the object of her   meditations  He heard her sighs  he saw her lovely hand frequently put   up to wipe away the tears that fell from her eyes while looking on it    he also saw her  more than once   though  doubtless  in those moments    not knowing what she did  press the lifeless image to her bosom with the   utmost tenderness  scarce could he give credit to the testimony of his   senses  near as he was to her  he even strained his sight to be more   sure  and  forgetting all the precautions he had taken  thrust himself   as far as he was able between the branches of which the arbour was   composed       On perceiving the effect this last action had produced  the gate  though   not above twenty paces off  seemed too slow a passage to fly to her   relief  and  setting his foot upon a pedestal of a statue  quick as   thought  or the flash of elemental fire  sprang over the myrtle hedge   that parted the garden from the walk   Ah  Madam   cried he  catching   her in his arms to hinder her from falling   what has the unhappy   Trueworth done to render his presence so alarming  How have I deserved   to appear thus dreadful in your eyes        That admirable presence of mind which Mrs  Munden had shewn on many   occasions  did not on this entirely leave her  the time he was speaking   those few words sufficed to enable her to recollect her scattered   spirits  and  withdrawing herself from the hold he had taken of her  and   removing a little farther on the bench  as if to give him room to sit     Sir   said she  with a voice pretty well composed   the obligations I   have to you demand other sort of sentiments than those you seem to   accuse me of  but I thought myself alone  and was not guarded against   the surprize of meeting you in this place     I ought  indeed   replied   he   to
