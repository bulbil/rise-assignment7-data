As my leave of absence had expired  I was afraid lest the minister should have superseded me in my lieutenancy  but he had not filled up the vacancy  and received my apologies very graciously   Thus am I  continued Cogollos  lieutenant of the Spanish guards  and my situation is exactly to my mind  The circle of my friends is respectable and pleasant  and I live at my ease among them  Would I could say as much  exclaimed Don Andrew  but I am very far from being satisfied with my lot  I have lost my appointment  which was not without its advantages  and have no friends of sufficient interest to procure me a better berth  Excuse me  Signor Don Andrew  cried I  with a sort of upbraiding smile  you have a friend in me who may chance to be better than no friend at all  I have told you already that I am a greater favourite with my lord duke than with the Duke of Lerma  and will you tell me to my face that you have no interest at court  Have you not already experienced the contrary  Recollect that  through the archbishop of Grenada s powerful recommendation  I procured you a nomination for Mexico  where you would have made your fortune  if love had not stepped in and marred it at Alicant  My means are now more extensive  since I have the ear of the prime minister  I give myself up to you then  replied Tordesillas  but do not send me into New Spain  though the first appointment in the colonies were at your disposal   Here we were interrupted by Donna Helena  who came into the room  and improved even upon the visions of my fancy by the reality of her charms  Cogollos introduced me as the companion who had solaced the tedious hours of his imprisonment  Yes  madam  said I to Donna Helena  my conversation did indeed soothe his sorrows  for it turned on you  The compliment was not thrown away  and I took my leave with repeated congratulations  With respect to Tordesillas  I assured him that within a week he should know how far my power as well as will extended   Nor were these mere words  On the very next day  the opportunity occurred  Santillane  said his excellency  the place of governor in the royal prison of Valladolid is vacant  it is worth more than three hundred pistoles a year  and is yours if you will accept of it  Not if it were worth ten thousand ducats  answered I  for it would carry me away from your lordship  But  replied the minister  you may fill it by deputy  and only visit occasionally  That is as it may be  rejoined I  but I shall only accept it on condition of resigning in favour of Don Andrew de Tordesillas  a brave and loyal gentleman  I should like to give him this place in acknowledgment of his kindness to me in the tower of Segovia   This plea made the minister laugh heartily  and say  As far as I see  Gil Blas  you mean to make yourself a general patron  Even so be it  my friend  the vacancy is yours for Tordesillas  but tell me unfeignedly what fellow feeling you have in the business  for you are not such a fool as to throw away your interest for nothing  My lord  answered I  Don Andrew charged me nothing for all his acts of friendship  and should not a man repay his obligations  You are become highly moral and self mortified  replied his excellency  rather more so than under the last administration  Precisely so  rejoined I  then evil communication corrupted my principles  bargain and sale were the order of the day  and I conformed to the established practice  now  all preferment is allotted on the footing of a meritorious free gift  and my integrity shall not be the last to fall in with the fashion       CH  XIV     Santillane s visit to the poet Nunez  the company and conversation   ONE day  after dinner  a fancy seized me to go and see the poet of the Asturias  feeling a sort of curiosity to know on what floor he lodged  I repaired to the house of Signor Don Bertrand Gomex Del Ribero  and asked for Nunez  He does not live here now  said the porter  but over the way  in apartments at the back of the house  I went thither  and crossing a small court  entered an unfurnished parlour  where my friend Fabricio was sitting at table  doing the honours to five or six guests from the hamlet and liberty of Parnassus   They were at the latter end of a feast  and of course at the beginning of an affray  but as soon as they perceived me  a dead silence succeeded to their obstreperous argumentation  Nunez rose from his seat with much pomp and circumstance of politeness to receive me  saying  Gentlemen  Signor de Santillane  He does me the honour to visit me under this humble roof  as the favourite of the prime minister  you will all join with me in tendering your humble services  At this introduction  the worshipful company got up and made their best bows
