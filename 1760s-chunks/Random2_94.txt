proposed  and carried my papers to a third  who assured me  that poetry was intirely out of his way  and asked  if I had got never a piece of secret history  thrown into a series of letters  or a volume of adventures  such as those of Robinson Crusoe  and Colonel Jack  or a collection of conundrums  wherewith to entertain the plantations —Being quite unfurnished for this dealer  I had recourse to another with as little success  and I verily believe was rejected by the whole trade   I was afterwards persuaded to offer myself as a translator  and accordingly repaired to a person  who was said to entertain numbers of that class in his pay  he assured me  he had already a great deal of that work on his hands  which he did not know what to do with  observed that translation was a meer drug  that branch of literature being overstocked by an inundation of authors from North Britain  and asked what I would expect per sheet  for rendering the Latin classicks into English —That I might not make myself too cheap  I determined to set a high price upon my qualifications  and demanded a guinea for every translated sheet —   A guinea    cried he  staring at me  then paused a little  and said  he had no occasion for my service at present —I found my error  and resolving to make amends  fell one half in my demand  upon which he stared at me again  and told me his hands were   284 full —I attempted others  without finding employment  and was actually reduced to a very uncomfortable prospect  when I bethought myself of offering my talents to the printers of halfpenny ballads  and other such occasional essays as are hawked about the streets —With this view  I applied to one of the most noted and vociferous of this tribe  who directed me to a person whom I found entertaining a whole crowd of them with gin  bread and cheese  he carried me into a little back parlour  very neatly furnished  where I signified my desire of being enrolled among his writers  and was asked  what kind of composition I professed —Understanding that my inclination leaned towards poetry  he expressed his satisfaction  telling me  one of his poets had lost his senses  and was confined in Bedlam  and the other was become dozed with drinking drams  so that he had not done any thing tolerable these many weeks —When I proposed  that we should enter into terms of agreement  he gave me to understand  that his bargains were always conditional  and his authors paid in proportion to the sale of their works     Having therefore settled these conditions  which  I do assure you  were not very advantageous to me  he assigned me a subject for a ballad  which was to be finished in two hours  and I retired to my garret in order to perform his injunction —As the theme happened to suit my fancy  I compleated a pretty sort of an ode  within the time prescribed  and brought it to him  big with hope of profit and applause  He read it in a twinkling  and to my utter astonishment  told me  it would not do  though indeed  he owned I wrote a good hand  and spelled very well  but my language   285 was too high flown  and of consequence not at all adapted to the capacity and taste of his customers —I promised to rectify that mistake  and in half an hour humbled my stile to the comprehension of vulgar readers  he approved of the alteration  and gave me some hopes of succeeding in time  though he observed  that my performance was very deficient in that quaintness of expression that pleases the multitude  However  to encourage me  he ventured the expence of printing and paper  and  if I remember a right  my share of the sale amounted to four pence halfpenny   From that day  I studied the Grub street manner with great diligence  and at length became such a proficient  that my works were in great request among the most polite of the chairmen  draymen  hackney coachmen  footmen and serving maids  Nay  I have enjoyed the pleasure of seeing my productions adorned with cuts  pasted upon the wall as ornaments in beer cellars and cobler s stalls  and have actually heard them sung in clubs of substantial tradesmen —But empty praise  you know  my dear friend  will not supply the cravings of nature —I found myself in danger of starving in the midst of all my fame  for of ten songs I composed  it was well if two had the good fortune to please —For this reason I turned my thoughts to prose  and during a tract of gloomy weather  published an apparition  on the substance of which I subsisted very comfortably a whole month  I have made many a good meal upon a monster  a rape has often afforded me great satisfaction  but a murder  well timed  was my never failing resource  What then  I was a most miserable slave to   286 my employers  who expected to be furnished at a minute s warning with prose and verse  just as they thought the circumstances of the times required  whether the inclination was
