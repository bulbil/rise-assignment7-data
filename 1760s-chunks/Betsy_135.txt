been called away to a milliner  who   was come with some things she had the day before ordered to be brought    and she had just dispatched this little affair  and got out of her   dishabille  when she had received the above mentioned message from Mr    Goodman       On her coming into the parlour  where dinner was that moment serving   up   I must request the favour of you  Miss Betsy   said Mr  Goodman     to do the honours of my table today     I shall do the best I can    Sir   replied Miss Betsy modestly   but am very sorry for the occasion   which obliges me to take upon me an office I am so little accustomed   to     You will be the better able to discharge it when it becomes   your duty   said Mr  Goodman  with a faint smile   but I believe this   is the only time I shall put you to it  I have a kinswoman  who I   expect will be so good as to take care of the affairs of my family   henceforward     O Sir   replied Miss Betsy  with a great deal of   concern   I hope Lady Mellasin has not for ever forfeited her place        Mr  Goodman was about to make some reply  when they heard the voice of   that lady whom Miss Betsy had just mentioned extremely loud upon the   stairs   I will not be used in this manner   cried she   if I must go    let him tell me so himself   On this  Mr  Goodman grew extremely red     Go   said he to the footman that waited at table   and tell Lady   Mellasin that I will not be disturbed     Hold   cried the lawyer     permit me  Sir  to moderate this matter   In speaking these words  he   rose hastily  and  without staying to hear what Mr  Goodman would say    ran to prevent Lady Mellasin from coming in  While he was gone   Yes    Miss Betsy   said Mr  Goodman   you will lose your companion  Miss   Flora  with her mother  leaves my house to night        Miss Betsy  who had gone out of Lady Mellasin s chamber before Mrs    Prinks brought her this piece of intelligence from Mr  Goodman  was   prodigiously surprized to hear him speak in this manner   It is a sudden   turn  indeed   pursued he   but the reasons which urge me to this   separation will hereafter appear such as I neither could nor ought to   have resisted   Miss Betsy only replying  that he was certainly the best   judge of what he did  no farther discourse happened on the subject  nor    indeed  on any other  for some moments       At last  however  Mr  Goodman taking notice that she looked more than   ordinarily serious   Perhaps   said he   you may think my house too   melancholy for you when they are gone  The relation I intend to bring   home  though a perfect good woman  is pretty far advanced in years  and    I believe  receives but few visits  especially from the younger sort    but as the house I have hired for Mr  Thoughtless will be ready in a day   or two  I should imagine he would be glad to have you with him till you   marry  but this   continued he   is at your own option  I do but mention   it  because I would have you entirely easy in this point  and consider   what it is will most contribute to make you so        Miss Betsy had only time to thank him for his goodness before the lawyer   came down  that gentleman had found a more difficult talk than he had   expected  in bringing Lady Mellasin to submit to the injunctions she had   received from her husband  not that she had the least spark of conjugal   affection for him  as the reader may very well suppose  or would have   wished ever to see him more  if she could have lived without him in the   same manner she did with him  but the thoughts of leaving her large and   richly appointed house  her fine side board of plate  her coach  her   equipage  and all those other ensigns of opulence and state she now   enjoyed  were insupportable to her  and  having in vain essayed what a   feigned penitence and tenderness could do  to work him to forgiveness    had now resolved to try the effect of a more haughty and imperious   deportment   I will make
