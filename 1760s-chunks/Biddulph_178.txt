I were to enter again into public life with a moderately genteel appearance only  nobody’s curiosity would be excited  as it might easily be supposed that my brother had enabled me to support a decent figure in the world —I soon found that I had made use of a wrong argument  which put my friend into a violent passion  A fiddle stick for you and your brother too  said he  do you think I will let that whelp have the credit of what I mean to do for you  no  no  set your heart at rest about that  what I do  all the world shall know  and my reasons for it too  I’ll have my own way  there is no hurt I hope in providing for a near kinswoman  that is left to starve by a still nearer relation  I make you my heir  look you  and I will spread it all    over the town  Is there any harm in that  God knows I have no more ill in my heart than one of your children  but I am a little resenting may be  so say no more of it  I found Mr Warner was pretty positive  therefore thought it the wisest way to insist no farther upon the argument  but told him I would submit intirely to his discretion  It will be best for you  said he  consider me as your father  and I will be a father to you  He then told me that he had been trying to get a house for me near my brother’s  that I might nose him as he called it  but that as there were none empty in the square  he had fixed on a very handsome one in an adjoining street  I did not like the furniture  said he  so I ordered it out  and have bespoke new of an upholder  who promises me  in a week or ten days at farthest  to have every thing completely fitted up  In the mean time I can’t bear to see you in this sorry room  poor soul  how long have you been here  I told him near four months  and that  with his permission  I would continue in these lodgings till the house was ready  as it was not worth while to change them for so short a time  Well  said he  you may do as you will for that  I’ll see that every thing is to your satisfaction  He took his leave with an affectionate shake by the hand   How miraculous is all this  my dear  this messenger of good tidings  is he not sent to me by providence  as I found he intended not to make a secret of his designs in my favour  I was in haste to divulge the joyful news to my friends  I have accordingly writ to my Lady V——  giving her an account of the wonderful revolution in my affairs  and I intend  as soon as I can fix upon some curious present worth her acceptance  to make her a large return for her favours  I have also acquainted Mrs Faulkland of the happy turn in my fortune  and I design a magnificent present for her as soon as I have time to prepare it  To neither of these ladies have I hinted at my brother’s behaviour  either to myself  or Mr Warner  I have made the good woman  with whom I lodge  stare wonderfully at the relation  I could get nothing from her but exclamations of astonishment  her hands and eyes lifted up  ‘Good God  Lord bless us  what strange things come about  what luck some people are born to  and this was your own  own cousin that you never set eyes on before  My goodness  what a swarthy gentleman he is  but tumbling in gold  I warrant him  It would be long before such good fortune would happen to me  though I have a cousin beyond seas too ’ I could plainly see that this poor woman envied my prosperity  though she tried to congratulate me  but it is the less to be wondered at  as she knew not that I was    born to any better prospect  than that of working for my bread in a two pair of stairs room   February 15  I have not seen my honest kinsman these four days  but he sent me a note to inform me that he was busy in seeing every thing put in order in my new house  and that he abstained from visiting me out of discretion  this word he marked  the more to impress his full meaning  He says I shall not see any thing till all is ready  neither has he yet so much as told me the street where I am to live  I find he will  as he himself says  have his own way   February 22  Now  my Cecilia  I may reasonably hope that my afflictions are at an end  as far as wealth can promote felicity  that felicity is mine   I have just settled with my landlady  and having paid her for her lodgings  made her a present  a little to reconcile her to my prosperity  when a new chariot most superbly gilt stopped at my door  a black and a white footman in rich laced
