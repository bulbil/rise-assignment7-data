Why should any man retire from society whilst he is capable of contributing to the pleasures of it  Wit  vivacity  good nature  and politeness  give an eternal youth  as stupidity and moroseness a premature old age  Without a thousandth part of your Lordship s shining qualities  I think myself much younger than half the boys about me  meerly because I have more good nature  and a stronger desire of pleasing       My daughter is much honored by your Lordship s enquiries  she is Bell Fermor still  but is addressed by a gentleman who is extremely agreable to me  and I believe not less so to her  I however know too well the free spirit of woman  of which she has her full share  to let Bell know I approve her choice  I am even in doubt whether it would not be good policy to seem to dislike the match  in order to secure her consent  there is something very pleasing to a young girl  in opposing the will of her father       To speak truth  I am a little out of humor with her at present  for having contributed  and I believe entirely from a spirit of opposition to me  to break a match on which I had extremely set my heart  the lady was the niece of my particular friend  and one of the most lovely and deserving women I ever knew  the gentleman very worthy  with an agreable  indeed a very handsome person  and a fortune which with those who know the world  would have compensated for the want of most other advantages       The fair lady  after an engagement of two years  took a whim that there was no happiness in marriage without being madly in love  and that her passion was not sufficiently romantic  in which piece of folly my rebel encouraged her  and the affair broke off in a manner which has brought on her the imputation of having given way to an idle prepossession in favor of another       Your Lordship will excuse my talking on a subject very near my heart  though uninteresting to you  I have too often experienced your Lordship s indulgence to doubt it on this occasion  your good natured philosophy will tell you  much fewer people talk or write to amuse or inform their friends  than to give way to the feelings of their own hearts  or indulge the governing passion of the moment       In my next  I will endeavor in the best manner I can  to obey your Lordship s commands in regard to the political and religious state of Canada  I will make a point of getting the best information possible  what I have yet seen  has been only the surface       I have the honor to be       My Lord   Your Lordship s  c   WILLIAM FERMOR     LETTER LXXXVIII   88   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Silleri  March 16  Monday   YOUR brother is come back  and has been here  he came after dinner yesterday  My Emily is more than woman  I am proud of her behaviour  he entered with his usual impatient air  she received him with a dignity which astonished me  and disconcerted him  there was a cool dispassionate indifference in her whole manner  which I saw cut his vanity to the quick  and for which he was by no means prepared       On such an occasion I should have flirted violently with some other man  and have shewed plainly I was piqued  she judged much better  I have only to wish it may last  He is the veriest coquet in nature  for  after all  I am convinced he loves Emily       He stayed a very little time  and has not been here this morning  he may pout if he pleases  but I flatter myself we shall hold out the longest   Nine o clock       He came to dine  we kept up our state all dinner time  he begged a moment s conversation  which we refused  but with a timid air that makes me begin to fear we shall beat a parley  he is this moment gone  and Emily retired to her apartment on pretence of indisposition  I am afraid she is a foolish girl   Half hour after six       It will not do  Lucy  I found her in tears at the window  following Rivers s carriole with her eyes  she turned to me with such a look in short  my dear    The weak  the fond  the fool  the coward woman   has prevailed over all her resolution  her love is only the more violent for having been a moment restrained  she is not equal to the task she has undertaken  her resentment was concealed tenderness  and has retaken its first form         I am sorry to find there is not one wise woman in the world but myself   Past ten       I have been with her again  she seemed a little calmer  I commended her spirit  she disavowed it  was peevish with me  angry with herself  said she had acted in a manner unworthy her character  accused herself of caprice  artifice  and
