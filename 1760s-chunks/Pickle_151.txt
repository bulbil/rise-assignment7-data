 had hired of certain Bohemians  who chanced to lodge at the inn  a  jackass adorned with bells  which  when everybody was retired to  rest  and the Hebrew supposed to be bedded with his mistress  they led  upstairs into a long thoroughfare  from which the chambers were detached  on each side  The painter  perceiving the lady s door ajar  according  to his expectation  mounted this animal  with intention to ride into the  room  and disturb the lovers in the midst of their mutual endearments   but the ass  true to its kind  finding himself bestrid by an unknown  rider  instead of advancing in obedience to his conductor  retreated  backward to the other end of the passage  in spite of all the efforts of  the painter  who spurred  and kicked  and pummeled to no purpose  It was  the noise of this contention between Pallet and the ass which invaded  the ears of Peregrine and his mistress  neither of whom could form the  least rational conjecture about the cause of such strange disturbance   which increased as the animal approached their apartment  At length  the bourrique s retrograde motion was obstructed by the door  which  it forced open in a twinkling  with one kick  and entered with such  complication of sound as terrified the lady almost into a fit  and threw  her lover into the utmost perplexity and confusion   The painter  finding himself thus violently intruded into the  bed chamber of he knew not whom  and dreading the resentment of the  possessor  who might discharge a pistol at him as a robber who had  broken into his apartment  was overwhelmed with consternation  and  redoubled his exertion to accomplish a speedy retreat  sweating all the  time with fear  and putting up petition to Heaven for his safety   but his obstinate companion  regardless of his situation  instead of  submitting to his conduct  began to turn round like a millstone  the  united sound of his feet and bells producing a most surprising concert   The unfortunate rider  whirling about in this manner  would have quitted  his seat  and left the beast to his own amusement  but the rotation was  so rapid  that the terror of a severe fall hindered him from attempting  to dismount  and  in the desperation of his heart  he seized one of his  ears  which he pinched so unmercifully  that the creature set up his  throat  and brayed aloud   This hideous exclamation was no sooner heard by the fair Fleming   already chilled with panic  and prepared with superstition  than   believing herself visited by the devil  who was permitted to punish her  for her infidelity to the marriage bed  she uttered a scream  and began    6 22 15  3 45 PM   to repeat her pater noster with a loud voice  Her lover  finding himself  under the necessity of retiring  started up  and  stung with the most  violent pangs of rage and disappointment  ran directly to the spot from  whence this diabolical noise seemed to proceed  There encountering the  ass he discharged such a volley of blows at him and his rider  that the  creature carried him off at a round trot  and they roared in unison all  the way  Having thus cleared the room of such disagreeable company   he went back to his mistress  and assuring her that this was only some  foolish prank of Pallet  took his leave  with a promise of returning  after the quiet of the inn should be re established   In the mean time  the noise of the bourrique  the cries of the painter   and the lady s scream  had alarmed the whole house  and the ass  in the  precipitation of his retreat  seeing people with lights before him  took  shelter in the apartment for which he was at first designed  just as  the Levite  aroused at the uproar  had quitted his dulcinea  and was  attempting to recover his own chamber unperceived  Seeing himself  opposed by such an animal  mounted by a tall  meagre  lantern jawed  figure  half naked  with a white nightcap upon his head which added to  the natural paleness of his complexion   the Jew was sorely troubled in  mind and believing it to be an apparition of Balaam and his ass  flew  backward with a nimble pace  and crept under the bed  where he lay   concealed  Mr  Jolter and the priest  who were the foremost of those  who had been aroused by the noise  were not unmoved when they saw such a  spectacle rushing into the chamber  whence the lady of pleasure began  to shriek  The governor made a full halt  and the Capuchin discovered no  inclination to proceed  They were  however  by the pressure of the crowd  that followed them  thrust forward to the door  through which the  vision entered  and there Jolter  with great ceremony  complimented his  reverence with the pas  beseeching him to walk in  The mendicant was  too courteous and humble to accept this
