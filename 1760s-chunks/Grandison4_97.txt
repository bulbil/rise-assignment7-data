her Moments of joy  And why  Because she then divests herself of all that is either painful or pleasurable to her in this life  For she says  that her cares for her Harriet  and especially now  are at least a balance for the delights she takes in her   You command me to acquaint you with what passes between me and the gentlemen in my neighbourhood  in your stile  m• fellows   Mr  Fenwick invited himself to breakfast with my aunt Selby yesterday morning  I would not avoid him   I will not trouble you with the particulars  You know well enough what men will say on the subject upon which you will suppose he wanted to talk to me  He was extremely earnest  I besought him to accept my thanks for his good opinion of me  as all the return I could make him for it  and this in so very serious a manner  that my heart was fretted  when he declared  with warmth his determined perseverance   Mr  Greville made us a tea visit in the afternoon  My uncle and he joined to railly us poor women  as usual  I left the defence of the Sex to my aunt and Lucy  How poor appears to me every conversation now with these men —But hold  saucy Harriet▪ was not your Uncle Selby one of the railliers —But he does not believe all he says  and therefore cannot wish to be so much regarded  on this topic  as he ought to be by me  on others   After the run of raillery was over  in which Mr  Greville made exceptions favourable to the women   242 present  he applied to every one for their interest with me  and to me to countenance his address  He set forth his pretensions very pompously  and mentioned a very considerable increase of his fortune  which before was a very handsome one  He offered our own terms  He declared his love for me above all women  and made his happiness in the next world  as well as in this  depend upon my favour to him   It was easy to answer all he said  and is equally so for you to guess in what manner I answered him  And he  finding me determined  began to grow vehement  and even affrontive  He hinted to me  that he knew what had made me so very resolute  He threw out threatnings against the man  be he whom he would  that should stand in the way of his success with me  at the same time intimating saucily  as I may say  for his manner had insult in it  that it was impossible a certain event could ever take place   My uncle was angry with him  so was my aunt  Lucy was still more angry than they  But I  standing up  said  Pray  my dear friends  take nothing amiss that Mr  Greville has said —He once told me  that he would set spies upon my conduct in town  If  Sir  your spies have been just  I fear nothing they can say  But the hints you have thrown out  shew such a total want of all delicacy of mind  that you must not wonder if my heart rejects you  Yet I am not angry  I reproach you not  every one has his peculiar way  All that is left me to say or to do  is to thank you for your favourable opinion of me  as I have thanked Mr  Fenwick  and to desire that you will allow me to look upon you as my neighbour  and only as my neighbour   I courtesied to him and withdrew   But my great difficulty had been before with Mr  Orme  His sister had desired that I would see her brother  He and she were invited by my aunt to dinner on Tuesday  They came  Poor man  He is   243 not well  I am sorry for it  Poor Mr  Orme is not well  He made me such honest compliments▪ as I may say  His heart was too much in his civilities to raise them above the civilities that justice and truth might warrant in favour of a person highly esteemed  Mine was filled with compassion for him  and that compassion would have shewn itself in tokens of tenderness  more than once  had I not restrained myself for his sake  How you  my dear Lady G  can delight in giving pain to an honest heart  I cannot imagine  I would make all God Almighty s creatures happy  if I could  and so would your noble brother  Is he not crossing dangerous seas  and ascending through almost perpetual snows  those dreadful Alps which I have heard described with such terror  for the generous end of relieving distress   I made Mr  Orme sit next me  I was assiduous to help him  and to do him all the little offices which I thought would light up pleasure in his modest countenance  and he was quite another man  It gave delight to his sister  and to all my friends  to see him smile  and look happy  I think  my dear Lady G  that when Mr  Orme looks pleasant  and at ease  he resembles a little the
