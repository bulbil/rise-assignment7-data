of pleasure and pain  the wretched must be repaid the balance of their sufferings in the life hereafter     MY friends  my children  and fellow sufferers  when I reflect on the distribution of good and evil here below  I find that much has been given man to enjoy  yet still more to suffer  Though we should examine the whole world  we shall not find one man so happy as to have nothing left to wish for  but we daily see thousands who by suicide shew us they  Page  152  have nothing left to hope  In this life then it appears that we cannot be entirely blest  but yet we may be completely miserable     Why man should thus feel pain  why our wretchedness should be requisite in the formation of universal felicity  why  when all other systems are made perfect only by the perfection of their subordinate parts  the great system should require for its perfection  parts that are not only subordinate to others  but imperfect in themselves  These are questions that never can be explained  and might be useless if known  On this subject providence has thought fit to elude our curiosity  satisfied with granting us motives to consolation     In this situation  man has called in the friendly assistance of philosophy  and heaven seeing the incapacity of that to console him  has given him the aid of religion   Page  153  The consolations of philosophy are very amusing  but often fallacious  It tells us that life is filled with comforts  if we will but enjoy them  and on the other hand  that though we unavoidably have miseries here  life is short  and they will soon be over  Thus do these consolations destroy each other  for if life is a place of comfort  its shortness must be misery  and if it be long  our griefs are protracted  Thus philosophy is weak  but religion comforts in an higher strain  Man is here  it tells us  fitting up his mind  and preparing it for another abode  When the good man leaves the body and is all a glorious mind  he will find he has been making himself a heaven of happiness here  while the wretch that has been maimed and contaminated by his vices  shrinks from his body with terror  and finds that he has anticipated the vengeance of  Page  154  heaven  To religion then we must hold in every circumstance of life for our truest comfort  for if already we are happy  it is a pleasure to think that we can make that happiness unending  and if we are miserable  it is very consoling to think that there is a place of rest  Thus to the fortunate religion holds out a continuance of bliss  to the wretched a change from pain     But though religion is very kind to all men  it has promised peculiar reward to the unhappy  the sick  the naked  the houseless  the heavy laden  and the prisoner  have ever most frequent promises in our sacred law  The author of our religion every where professes himself the wretch s friend  and unlike the false ones of this world  bestows all his caresses upon the forlorn  The unthinking have censured this as partiality  as a preference without  Page  155  merit to deserve it  But they never reflect that it is not in the power even of heaven itself to make the offer of unceasing felicity as great a gift to the happy as to the miserable  To the first eternity is but a single blessing  since at most it but encreases what they already possess  To the latter it is a double advantage  for it diminishes their pain here  and rewards them with heavenly bliss hereafter     But providence is in another respect kinder to the poor than the rich  for as it thus makes the life after death more desirable  so it smooths the passage there  The wretched have long familiarity with every face of terror  The man of sorrows lays himself quietly down  he has no possessions to regret  and but few ties to stop his departure  he feels only nature s pang in the final separation  and this is no way greater than he has often fainted under before  for after a certain degree of pain  every  Page  156  new breach that death opens in the constitution  nature kindly covers with insensibility     Thus providence has given the wretched two advantages over the happy in this life  greater felicity in dying  and in heaven all that superiority of pleasure which arises from contrasted enjoyment  And this superiority  my friends  is no small advantage  and seems to be one of the pleasures of the poor man in the parable  for though he was already in heaven  and felt all the raptures it could give  yet it was mentioned as an addition to his happiness  that he had once been wretched and now was comforted  that he had known what it was to be miserable  and now felt what it was to be happy     Thus  my friends  you see religion does what philsophy could never do  it shews the equal dealings of heaven to the happy  Page  157  and
