art going to fight for thy country  remember how thy brave grandfather fought for his sacred king  when loyalty among Britons was a virtue  Go  my boy  and immitate  Page  40  him in all but his misfortunes  if it was a misfortune to die with Lord Falkland  Go  my boy  and if you fall  tho  distant  exposed and unwept by those that love you  the most precious tears are those with which heaven bedews the unburied head of a soldier    The next morning I took leave of the good family  that had been kind enough to entertain me so long  not without several expressions of gratitude to Mr  Thornhill for his late bounty  I left them in the enjoyment of all that happiness which affluence and good breeding procure  and returned towards home  despairing of ever finding my daughter more  but sending a sigh to heaven to spare and to forgive her  I was now come within about twenty miles of home  having hired an horse to carry me  as I was yet but weak  and comforted myself with the hopes of soon seeing all I held dearest upon earth  But the night  Page  41  coming on  I put up at a little public house by the road side  and asked for the landlord s company over a pint of wine  We sate beside his kitchen fire  which was the best room in the house  and chatted on politics and the news of the country  We happened  among other topics  to talk of young  Squire Thornhill  whom the host assured me was hated as much as an uncle of his  who sometimes came down to the country  was loved  He went on to observe  that he made it his whole study to betray the daughters of such as received him to their houses  and after a fortnight or three weeks possession  he turned them out unrewarded and abandoned to the world  As we continued our discourse in this manner  his wife  who had been out to get change  returned  and perceiving that her husband was enjoying a pleasure in which she was not a sharer  she asked him  in an angry tone  what he did there  to which he only replied in an ironical way  by drinking her health      Mr   Page  42  Symmonds    cried she    you use me very ill  and I ll bear it no longer  Here three parts of the business is left for me to do  and the fourth left unfinished  while you do nothing but soak with the guests all day long  whereas if a spoonful of liquor were to cure me of a fever  I never touch a drop    I now found what she would be at  and immediately poured her out a glass  which she received with a curtesy  and drinking towards my good health    Sir    resumed she    it is not so much for the value of the liquor I am angry  but one cannot help it  when the house is going out of the windows  If the customers or guests are to be dunned  all the burthen lies upon my back  he d as lief eat that glass as budge after them himself  There now above stairs  we have a young woman who has come to take up her lodgings here  and I don t believe she has got any money by her over civility  I am certain  Page  43  she is very slow of payment  and I wish she were put in mind of it    —   What signifies minding her    cried the host    if she be slow  she is sure    —   I don t know that    replied the wife    but I know that I am sure she has been here a fortnight  and we have not yet seen the cross of her money    —   I suppose  my dear    cried he    we shall have it all in a lump    —   In a lump    cried the other    I hope we may get it any way  and that I am resolved we shall this very night  or out she tramps  bag and baggage    —   Consider  my dear    cried the husband    she is a gentlewoman  and deserves more respect    —   As for the matter of that    returned the hostess    gentle or simple  out she shall pack with a sassarara  Gentry may be good things where they take  but for my part I never saw much good of them at the sign of the Harrow    —Thus saying  she ran up a narrow flight of stairs  that went from the kitchen  Page  44  to a room over head  and I soon perceived by the loudness of her voice  and the bitterness of her reproaches  that no money was to be had from her lodger  I could hear her remonstrances very distinctly    Out I say  pack out
