lovely beyond description  and we were engaged in a very lively conversation  when  as we approached the temple  we saw Harry  who had just left us on pretence of writing letters  come out of it with the detestable Westbrook leaning familiarly on his arm  her pert eyes softened into languishment  and fixed eagerly on his  the forward creature started at seeing us  and attempted to fly  which Harry prevented  and  withdrawing his arm from hers  as if mechanically  advanced slowly towards us  with a look so confused  a mien so disordered  so different form that easy air which gives ten thousand graces to the finest form in the world  as convinced me          1 106       that this meeting was not accidental  Lady Julia stopt the moment she saw them  a deep blush overspread her face  she fixed her eyes on the ground  and waited their approach silent and unmoved as a statue  Not so the cit  the creature s assurance  and the ease with which she recovered herself and addressed Lady Julia  excited equally my astonishment and indignation  She told her  she came to wait on her Ladyship  and the fineness of the evening had tempted her to leave her coach at the entrance of the wood  that as she walked thro  she happened to meet Mr  Mandeville  quite by chance she assured her Ladyship  as he would testify  Harry disdain d to confirm her falshood even by an assenting look  his silence  the coldness of his manner  with the air of dignity and spirit Lady Julia assumed  almost disconcerted her  we walk d silently to the house  where the girl only stay d till her coach was order d round  and then left us  her eyes        1 107       ask d Harry s attendance  but he chose not to understand their language      This evening was the only unpleasant one I ever past at Belmont  a reserve  unknown before in that seat of sincere friendship  took place of the sweet confidence which used to reign there  and to which it owes its most striking charms  We retired earlier than common  and Lady Julia  instead of spending half an hour in my apartment  as usual  took leave of me at the door and passed on to her own        I am extremely alarmed for her    it would have been natural to have talked over so extraordinary an adventure with me  if not too nearly interested    There was a constraint in her behaviour to Harry all the evening    an assumed coldness    his assiduity seemed to displease her    she sighed often    nay once  when my eyes met hers  I observed a tear ready to start    she may          1 108       call this friendship if she pleases  but these very tender  these apprehensive  these jealous friendships  between amiable young people of different sexes  are exceedingly suspicious      It is an hour later than her usual time of appearing  and I hear nothing of her  I am determined not to indulge this tender melancholy  and have sent up to let her know I attend her in the saloon  for I often breakfast in my own apartment  it being the way here for every body to do whatever they like           Indeed  a letter from Lady Julia     a vindication     nay then     guilty upon my honor      Why imagine I suspect her     Oh  Conscience  Conscience        Her extreme fear of my supposing her in love with Harry is a convincing proof that she is  tho  such is her amiable sincerity           1 109       that I am sure she has deceived herself before she would attempt to deceive me  but the latter is not so easy  sitters by see all the game      She tells me  she cannot see me till she has vindicated herself from a suspicion which the weakness of her behaviour yesterday may have caused  That she is not sure she has resolution to mention the subject when present  therefore takes this way to assure me  that  tender and lively as her friendship for Mr  Mandeville is  it is only friendship  a friendship which his merit has hitherto justified  and which has been the innocent pleasure of her life  That born with too keen sensibilities  poor thing  I pity her sensibilities  the ill treatment of her friends wounds her to the soul  That zeal for his honor and the integrity of his character  which she thinks injured by the mysterious air of last night s adventure  her shock at a clandestine and          1 110       dissembled appointment  so inconsistent with that openness which she had always admired in him
