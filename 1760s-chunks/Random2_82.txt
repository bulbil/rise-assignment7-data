that I did not even know my own extraction —Though I expected all this  I could not hear it with temper  especially as truth was so blended with falshood in the assertion  that it would be almost impossible to separate the one from the other in my vindication —But I said nothing on this head  being impatient to know how Narcissa had been affected with the discovery —That generous creature  far from believing these imputations  was no sooner withdrawn with her confidante  than she inveighed with great warmth against the malevolence of the world  to which only she ascribed the whole of what had been said to my disadvantage  and calling every circumstance of my behaviour to her  into review before her  found every thing so polite  honourable and disinterested  that she could not harbour the least doubt of my being the gentleman I appeared to be —   I have indeed  said she  purposely forbore to ask the particulars of his life  lest the recapitulation of some misfortunes  which he has undergone  should give him pain  And as to the article of his fortune  I own myself equally afraid of inquiring into it  and   244 of discovering the situation of my own  lest we should find ourselves both unhappy in the explanation  for alas  my provision is conditional  and depends entirely on my marrying with my brother s consent      Thunderstruck with this intelligence  the light forsook my eyes  the colour vanished from my cheeks  and I remained in a state of universal trepidation —My female friend perceiving my disorder  encouraged me with assurances of Narcissa s constancy  and the hope of some accident favourable to our love  and as a further consolation let me know  that she had acquaintd my mistress with the out lines of my life  and that although she was no stranger to the present low state of my finances  her love and esteem were rather encreased than diminished by the knowledge of my circumstances —I was greatly comforted by this assurance  which saved me a world of confusion and anxiety  For I must have imparted my situation one day to Narcissa  and this I could not have done without shame and disorder   As I did not doubt that by this time  the scandalous aspersions of Melinda were diffused all over the town  I resolved to collect my whole strength of assurance  to brow beat the efforts of her malice  and to publish her adventure with the Frenchified barber  by way of reprisal —In the mean time  having promised to be at the garden gate about midnight  Miss Williams took her leave  bidding me repose myself entirely on the affection of my dear Narcissa  which was as perfect as inviolable —Before I went abroad I was visited by Freeman  who   245 came on purpose to acquaint me with the infamous stories  that were raised at my expence  I heard them with great temper  and in my turn informed him of every thing that had happened between Melinda and me  and among other things entertained him with the story of the barber  letting him know what share his friend Banter had in that affair  He was convinced of the injury my reputation had suffered  and no longer doubting the source from whence this deluge of slander had flowed upon me  undertook to undeceive the town in my behalf  and roll the stream back upon its origin  but in the mean time cautioned me from appearing in publick while the prepossession was strong against me  lest I should meet with some affront that might have bad consequences     246  CHAP  LIX    I receive an extraordinary message at the door of the long room  which I however enter  and affront the Squire  who threatens to take the law of me—I rebuke Melinda for her malice—She weeps with vexation—Lord Quiverwit is severe upon me—I retort his sarcasm—am received with the utmost tenderness by Narcissa  who desires to hear the story of my life—we vow eternal constancy to one another—I retire—am waked by a messenger  who brings a challenge from Quiverwit  whom I meet  engage  and vanquish   I Thanked him for his advice  which  however  my pride and resentment would not permit me to follow  for he no sooner left me  in order to do justice to my character among his friends and acquaintance  than I sallied out  and went directly to the long room —I was met at the door by a servant  who presented to me a billet without a subscription  importing that my presence was disagreeable to the company  and desiring I would take the hint without further disturbance  and bestow myself elsewhere for the future —This peremptory message filled me with indignation —I followed the fellow who delivered it  and seizing him by the collar  in presence of all   247 the company  threatned to put him instantly to death  if he did not discover the scoundrel who had charged him with such an impudent commission  that I might punish him as he deserved —The messenger  affrighted at my menaces and furious looks  fell upon his knees  and told me  that the gentleman who ordered him to deliver the letter was no other than Narcissa s brother  who at that time stood at the other end of the room  talking to Melinda —I went up to him immediately  and
