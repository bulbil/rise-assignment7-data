  insults that succeeded it  and when she reflected how much Melanthe   loved the count  and that she had already granted him all the favours in   her power  it seemed to her rather an act of cruelty than friendship  to   acquaint her with this ingratitude  and thereby anticipate a misfortune    which  perhaps  by his artifices and continued dissimulation  might be   for a long time concealed  therefore  for this reason  she exacted a   promise from monsieur du Plessis not to make any noise of this affair   at his return to Venice  unless the count  by some rash and precipitate   behaviour  should enforce him to it       This injunction discovered so forgiving a sweetness of disposition in   the person who made it  that monsieur du Plessis could not refrain   testifying his admiration by the most passionate exclamations  in which   perhaps he had continued longer  had not the eyes of the fair object   discovered a certain languishment  which reminded him  he should be   wanting in the respect he professed  to detain her any longer from that   repose  which  seemed necessary  after the extraordinary hurry of   spirits she had sustained  therefore having taken his leave of her for   that night  retired to a chamber he had ordered to be got ready for him    as did she to that where she had been so lately disturbed  but all those   who are in the least capable of any idea of those emotions  which   agitated the minds of both these amiable persons  will believe neither   of them slept much that night             CHAP  XVI        The Innkeepers scruples oblige Louisa to write to Melanthe  her   behavior on the discovery of the count s falshood  Louisa changes her   resolution and goes to Bolognia        Monsieur du Plessis  having found it impossible to dissuade Louisa from   going to England  now bent his whole thoughts to perform his promise of   conducting her to Leghorn  in the most commodious manner he could    accordingly he rose very early  and calling for the man of the house    desired he would provide a handsome post chaise  and if he knew any   fellows whose integrity might be relied on  he thought necessary to hire   two such  who  furnished with fire arms  might serve as a guard against   any attack the count might take it into his head to make       But the innkeeper had now entertained notions that forbid him to   correspond with the designs of monsieur  some of his neighbours  who had   heard of last night s accident  whispered it in his ears  that it would   not be safe for him to let these young people depart together  that he   could not be assured the person  who pretended to be the husband  might   not be so in reality  and if he should come again with proper officers   and proofs to claim his wife  it might be of dangerous consequence to   him to have favoured her escape  and that the only way he had to secure   himself from being brought into trouble  was to lay the whole affair   before the podestat  This advice seemed to him too reasonable not to be   complied with  he went directly to that magistrate  and while the lover   was speaking to him  officers came in to seize both him and Louisa  and   carry them before the podestat       Monsieur du Plessis was very much surprized and vexed at this   interruption  and the more so  as he feared it would terrify Louisa to a   greater degree than the nature of the thing required  but in this he did   injury to her courage  when she was called up and informed of the   business  she surrendered herself with all the dauntlessness of   innocence to the officers  and suffered them to conduct her  with du   Plessis  to the house of the podestat       Both of them flattered themselves with the belief  that when he should   come to hear the story  they would be immediately discharged  but he   happened to be one of those who are over wary in the execution of their   office  and he only told them  that what they said might be true  but he   was not to take things on the bare word of the parties themselves  and   that therefore they must be confined till either the person who claimed   the woman for his wife  should bring proofs she was so  or she should be   able to make out he had no right over her       That is easy for me to do  said Louisa  I am only concerned that this   gentleman  meaning du Plessis  should be detained on an account
