was well managed  while  on the other side  the French acted with the utmost timidity  it was in vain that their commander exhorted them to proceed  though a   229 breach was made  and lay open for fifteen days  not one of them dared to venture out to the assault  Beside this  they were ill supplied with provisions  and the arrival of a reinforcement in the garrison soon after  served to banish all hopes of success  After a brisk fire they raised the siege  and this miscarriage so intirely depressed the ardour of the enemy  that they appeared quite dispirited in almost every ensuing engagement  In this manner  therefore  their affairs went on declining  not less by land than by sea  There were several engagements between the two fleets  in which the French  though superior in number of ships and men  always declined a decisive engagement   But the French were not the only enemies the English had to fear in this part of the world  the jealousy of the Dutch was excited by our repeated success  and the late extension of our power  As this dispute  however trifling it may seem  may  one day  be of greater consequence than it appears at present  I shall be more particular in my relation of it   Under a pretence of reinforcing their garrisons in Bengal  the Dutch equipped an armament of seven ships  which was ordered to sail up the Ganges  and render their fort at a place called Chincura so formidable as to be able to bid defiance to the power of Britain  and thus secure to themselves the trade for salt petre  which this place afforded  This design  however  Colonel Clive thought incumbent on him  if possible  to defeat  and sending the Dutch commander a letter  he informed him that he could not permit his landing  and marching forces to Chincura  To this message the Dutchman replied  that he had no such designs as were imputed to him  and he only begged liberty to land his troops to refresh them  a request which was readily granted  He made these concessions  however  only till he knew that the ships which were to second his operations  were come up the river  and   230 then  throwing off the mask  he began his march to Chincura  and took several small vessels belonging to the English  to retaliate for the affront he pretended to have sustained in being denied permission to proceed  Whether  upon this occasion the Calcutta Indiaman was sent out to interrupt their progress  or was only pursuing its way homeward  is not clearly known  but certain it is  that the Dutch commander threatened to sink it  if it presumed to pass him  The English captain seeing them point their guns  as if they really resolved to put their threats in execution  returned to Calcutta  where two other India ships lay at anchor  and reported his adventure to Colonel Clive  who instantly ordered the three Indiamen to prepare for battle  The Dutch fleet were not remiss in advancing to meet them  After a few broadsides  however  the Dutch Commodore struck  and the rest of his fleet followed the example  The victory being thus obtained without any loss to the English  Captain Wilson  who commanded in the expedition  took possession of the prizes which had greatly suffered  and the crews were sent prisoners to the English fort  In the mean time their land forces  which amounted to eleven hundred men  were totally defeated by Colonel Ford  sent upon that duty by Clive  A considerable part were killed  and the rest were made prisoners of war  During this contest  the Nabob preserved a suspicious neutrality  ready  as it should seem  to join with the conquerors  Fortune  however  no sooner determined in favour of the English  than he offered them his services  and professed himself ready to demolish the Dutch fortification of Chincura  This contest was represented in very different lights to the respective governments at home  the Dutch declaimed against the English  oppressing all who attempted to trade in the Indies  while the English  on the other hand  reminded the Dutch of their   231 former cruelties  and of their desire of gain  even at the expence of every moral obligation  However  soon after a negotiation ensued  the Dutch wisely gave way to a power they were unable to withstand  A treaty was concluded  and peace was restored  seemingly to the satisfaction of both parties  Such is the present situation of this contest  which  probably  contains the seeds of future dissension  The Dutch will  upon all occasions  think it allowable to increase their power in India to whatsoever pitch they think proper  and the English will ever find it their interest to repel them  It may thus happen  that the amity of the two powers in Europe will not be sufficient to preserve unanimity in so distant a part of the world  In this manner  while Great Britain puts an end to one war  she often lays the foundation for another  for  extended Empire ever produces an increasing necessity to defend it   Our success against the French on the coast of Coromandel was not less conspicuous  our troops were headed by Colonel Coote
