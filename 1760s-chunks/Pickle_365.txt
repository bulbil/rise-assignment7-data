planned by a private person   a project  in the execution of which M   had the good of the public  and  the glory of putting in a flourishing condition the valuable branch of  our trade which gives employment to two great provinces and above two  hundred sail of ships  much more at heart than his own private interest   It was reasonable to expect  that a man whose debts M   had paid more  than once  whom he had obliged in many other respects  and whom he had  carried with him at a very considerable expense  on this expedition   merely with a view of bettering his fortune  would have acted with  common honesty  if not with gratitude  but such was the depravity  of this little monster s heart  that  on his deathbed  he left a  considerable fortune to mere strangers  with whom he had little or no  connection  without the least thought of refunding the money advanced    6 22 15  3 45 PM   for him by M    in order to prevent his rotting in a jail    When M   had once obtained a command of money  he  by his knowledge  in several branches of trade  as well as by the assistance of some  intelligent friends at Paris and London  found means to employ it to  very good purpose  and had he been a man of that selfish disposition   which too much prevails in the world  he might have been at this day  master of a very ample fortune  but his ear was never deaf to the voice  of distress  nor his beneficent heart shut against the calamities of his  fellow creatures  He was even ingenious in contriving the most  delicate methods of relieving modest indigence  and  by his industrious  benevolence  often anticipated the requests of misery    I could relate a number of examples to illustrate my assertions  in  some of which you would perceive the most disinterested generosity   but such a detail would trespass too much upon your time  and I do not  pretend to dwell upon every minute circumstance of his conduct  Let it  suffice to say  that  upon the declaration of war in Spain  he gave up  all his commercial schemes  and called in his money from all quarters   with a view of sitting down  for the rest of his life  contented with  what he had got  and restraining his liberalities to what he could spare  from his yearly income  This was a very prudential resolution  could  he have kept it  but  upon the breaking out of the war  he could not  without concern see many gentlemen of merit  who had been recommended  to him  disappointed of commissions  merely for want of money to satisfy  the expectations of the commission brokers of that time  and therefore  launched out considerable sums for them on their bare notes  great part  whereof was lost by the death of some in the unfortunate expedition  to the West Indies  He at length  after many other actions of the like  nature  from motives of pure humanity  love of justice  and abhorrence  of oppression  embarked in a cause  every way the most important that  ever came under the discussion of the courts of law in these kingdoms   whether it be considered in relation to the extraordinary nature of the  case  or the immense property of no less than fifty thousand pounds a  year  and three peerages that depended upon it    In the year 1740  the brave admiral who at that time commanded his  majesty s fleet in the West Indies  among the other transactions of his  squadron transmitted to the duke of Newcastle  mentioned a young man   who  though in the capacity of a common sailor on board one of the ships  under his command  laid claim to the estate and titles of the earl of  A    These pretensions were no sooner communicated in the public papers   than they became the subject of conversation in all companies  and the  person whom they chiefly affected  being alarmed at the appearance of a  competitor  though at such a distance  began to put himself in motion   and take all the precautions which he thought necessary to defeat  the endeavour of the young upstart  Indeed  the early intelligence he  received of Mr  A   s making himself known in the West Indies  furnished  him with numberless advantages over that unhappy young gentleman  for   being in possession of a splendid fortune  and lord of many manors in  the neighbourhood of the very place where the claimant was born  he  knew all the witnesses who could give the most material evidence of his  legitimacy  and  if his probity did not restrain him  had  by his power  and influence  sufficient opportunity and means of applying to the  passions and interests of the witnesses  to silence many  and gain over  others to his side  while his competitor  by an absence of fifteen  or sixteen years from his native country  the want of education and
