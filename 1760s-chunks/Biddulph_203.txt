I might open my design to the old gentleman  which I did in few words  How the good man was delighted with the happy prospect which his deservedly beloved daughter had before her  he has left the affair intirely to me  so that I hope to have the girl disposed of very much to all our satisfaction   May 18  I am charmed with Mr Warner’s noble behaviour  I claim an interest  said he  in these honest creatures that you have taken under your protection  I like the old fellow mightily  and admire the little girl so much  that  if you had not provided a better husband for her  I should have been half tempted to have taken her myself  but since it is as it    is  we must do handsomely by her   I told him I had enquired into the young man’s circumstances  and found that about a thousand pounds would set him forward extremely well  and that this was the portion I intended to give him with the young gentlewoman   Well said he  I believe that will do  but I must make the poor thing a present myself for wedding trinkets  And the old man too  must we not take care of him   Dear Sir  said I  how good you are  You would remind me of my duty  if I myself were forgetful of it  But I have already settled a hundred pounds a year on him   Is that enough  said he  will it make the good fellow easy   Oh  Sir  it exceeds his wishes  he intends to live with his daughter  as his growing infirmities require her tender care   Every thing is to be this day settled  Mr Price is exceedingly pleased with his son in law elect  and the wedding will be no longer delayed  than till Mr Main receives the answer to those letters which he has wrote to his friends in the country  to apprize them of his approaching marriage   May 26  I am sure my dear Cecilia will rejoice with her friend in the acquisition she has received to her own happiness by conferring so much on a worthy family  The bride is this day gone home to her own house  her delighted father with her  Their prayers and blessings  poured out from truly grateful and virtuous hearts  remain with me  A reward  my dear  and a rich one too  for the self satisfying part I have acted   My worthy Patty  whose merit alone raises her much above her station  I shall no longer consider as my servant  She has been my friend in the tenderest and most enlarged sense of the word  and she shall continue so  I have hired another maid to wait on me  and with a sort of merry ceremony enfranchised Patty on the day of her brother’s marriage  for I had her dressed elegantly as bride’s maid to her new sister  and she sat on her right hand at the wedding dinner  I look on her as my companion  but I cannot persuade her to forget that I was her mistress  She shews this by actions  not by words   Here follows an interval of thirteen months  in which nothing material to the thread of the story occurs  The journal contains only a    continued series of such actions  as shewed the noble and pious use which Mrs Arnold made of the great fortune which providence had blessed her with  The rest is filled up with a variety of little incidents  many of them relative to her brother and his lady  to Mr Warner  and several letters from Lady V——  with whom she constantly corresponded  At the end of that period the journal proceeds thus   June 28  1708 And shall I really be so blessed  my ever beloved Cecilia  as to see you at the time you mention  Oh  my dear  after an absence of five long years  how my heart bounds with joy at your approach  The two months that are to intervene before we meet will appear very tedious to me  But it is always so with happiness  that is within our view  Before I expected you  though I regretted your absence  yet did I patiently acquiesce under it  and could entertain my thoughts with other objects  but I am now  I cannot tell you how anxious and impatient to see you  And yet  my Cecilia  we shall have nothing new to say to each other  knowing as we both do every circumstance of each other’s life since we parted  Mine has been a strange one  but my lot is now fallen on a fair ground  where  I hope it will please heaven to continue me whilst I am to remain in this world  The noble  I may almost call it  princely fortune that my kinsman has settled on me  will enable me to leave my children greatly provided for  whenever it shall be God’s pleasure to call me away  Let me but live to embrace my Cecilia  and then  providence  thy will be done   June 29  Gracious God  for what I am yet reserved  My trembling hand can scarce hold my pen  but I will try to tell you the event which yesterday produced
