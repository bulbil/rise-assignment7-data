own defence  had actually withdrawn his garrisons from the frontier places  which were by this time peaceably occupied by the invading army of   133 Chinese and Coreans  that the few troops he had  were without cloaths  arms  and discipline  and that he had amused the court of Meaco with false musters  and a specious account of levies and preparations which had been made  In a word  though he could not learn the particulars  he comprehended the whole mystery of the secret negotiations  He upbraided the minister of Fumma with persidy  refused to assume the command of the Japonese auxiliaries when they arrived  and returning to Meaco  communicated his discoveries and suspicions to the new Cuboy  But he did not meet with that reception which he thought he deserved for intelligence of such importance  Yak strot affected to doubt  perhaps  he was not really convinced  or  if he was  thought proper to temporize  and he was in the right for so doing  A rupture with Fumma   134 at this juncture  would have forced the prince to declare openly for the enemies of Japan  in which case the inhabitants of Niphon would have lost the benefit of a very advantageous trade  They had already been great sufferers in commerce by the breach with the king of Corea  whose subjects had been used to take off great quantities of the Japonese manufactures  for which they payed in gold and silver  and they could ill bear such an additional loss as an interruption of the trade with Fumma would have occasioned  The Cuboy  therefore  continued to treat the prince of that country as a staunch ally  who had sacrificed every other consideration to his good faith  and  far from restricting himself to the number of troops and Fune stipulated in the treaty  sent over a much more numerous body of sorces and ships of war  declaring  at the same   135 time  he would support the people of Fumma with the whole power of Japan   Such a considerable diversion of the Japonese strength could not fail to answer  in some measure  the expectation of the two sovereigns of China and Corea  but it did not prevent the success of the expeditions which were actually employed against their colonies in the Indian ocean  It was not in his power  however  to protect Fumma  had the invaders been in earnest  but the combined army of the Chinese and Coreans had orders to protract the war  and  instead of penetrating to the capital  at a time when the Fummians  tho  joined with the auxiliaries of Japan  were not numerous enough to look them in the face  they made a full stop in the middle of their march  and quietly retired into summer quarters     136 The additional incumbrance of a new continental war  redoubled the Cuboy s desire of peace  and his inclination being known to the enemy  who were also sick of the war  they had recourse to the good offices of a certain neutral power  called Sab oi  sovereign of the mountains of Cambodia  This prince accordingly offered his mediation at the court of Meaco  and it was immediately accepted —The negotiation for peace  which had been broke off in the ministry of Taycho  was now resumed  an ambassador plenipotentiary arrived from Pekin  and Gotto mio was sent thither in the same capacity  in order to adjust the articles  and sign the preliminaries of peace   While this new treaty was on the carpet  the armament equipped against Fan yah under the command of the Quo Kep marl  and the brave   137 admiral  who had signalized himself in the sea of Kamtschatka  reduced that important place  where they became masters of a strong squadron of Fune belonging to the king of Corea  together with a very considerable treasure  sufficient to indemnify Japan for the expence of the expedition  This  though the most grievous  was not the only disaster which the war brought upon the Coreans  Their distant settlement of Lli nam was likewise taken by general Tra rep  and the inhabitants payed an immense sum in order to redeem their capital from plunder   These successes did not at all retard the conclusion of the treaty  which was indeed become equally necessary to all the parties concerned  Japan  in particular  was in danger of being ruined by her conquests  The war had destroyed so many   138 men  that the whole empire could not afford a sufficiency of recruits for the maintenance of the land forces  All those who had conquered Fatsisio and Fan yah  were already destroyed by hard duty and the diseases of those unhealthy climates  above two thirds of the Fune were rotten in the course of service  and the complements of mariners reduced to less than one half of their original numbers  Troops were actually wanting to garrison the new conquests  The finances of Japan were by this time drained to the bottom  One of her chief resources was stopped by the rupture with Corea  while her expences were considerably augmented  and her national credit was stretched even to cracking  All these considerations stimulated more and more the Dairo and his Cuboy to conclude the work of peace     139 Mean while the enemies of Yakstrot gave him no quarter nor respite  They vilified his parts  traduced his morals
