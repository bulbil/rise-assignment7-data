will not  indeed cannot  give one shilling     more for it          Then  let the other have it   I will not lose fivepence  much less   five hundred pounds  for him          But  please your grace  you know what grounds he has to expect   iton   besides  your promise  which oaimot well be broken through    it was so positive        â   My promise was only conditional  in my own intention  that he   should give me as much as another  and in no other sense will I   keep it  As for his grounds of expectations  I regard them not     let him make the most of them where he can          Just as your grace pleases  I only took the liberty of speaking   my own opinion  but always in submission to yours  Not but I   must own I am apprehensive of this gentleman s resentment  though   not immediately for myself  so much as for your grace s character    with which he may be provoked to make too free upon such an affair        Ah   that is liberty  boasted English liberty  to speak dis    respectfully of your superiors  But I despise whatever he can say    rior will I give up my own way for fear of his impertinence        â€¢ Very right   your grace is very right  It were by no means fit   that you should  Then it is to be considered whether this breach   of promise may not be attended with inconveniences that may   overbalance the advantage  as it may make others afraid to deal   with you at another time          I will venture that   none can come to me  but for their own   advantage  and while they can find that  they will scarce stay away   for punctilios  So  let me hear no more of this  but close with the   other directly          Will not your grace please to abate of your demand for that   place in Ireland   I really fear you rate it too high          Not a shilling   I will not abate a shilling  Surely I ought to     know the value of things in Ireland by this time   I have had sufficient     dealings thereto teachme   it has been my privy purse for many years         But what I fear is  that if your grace does not fix upon some one     directly  the lord deputy may  and that would disappoint you          160 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     for this place has ever been immediately in his gift  and it would   reflect a kind of dishonour on him to give it up          Dishonour  indeed   I am much concerned for his honour    certainly   and as for his naming anyone to contradict me  I believe   he will be cautious how he does that  The example of his prede    cessor will teach him          However  if your grace pleases to prevent any disputes  I will   wait on him and tell him that you have a friend whom you design   to recommend         With all my heart   you may  if you will  But as to the price    I will not abate one shilling  as I said before  Do not I know that   places in that country are either mere pensions  without anything   to do  or even necessity of ever governing there at all  or where that   cannot be dispensed with from the nature of the place  that no   learning  no abilities are requisite  If it was here  indeed  where   knowledge in a profession is absolutely necessary to a place in it    there might be something in higgling about the price   but for a   coward to scruple paying for being made a general  or a blockhead   a judge  there can be nothing more unreasonable  and I will not hear   another word about it  But what have you done about those titles   which I gave you to dispose of           Really  I do not know what to say to your grace about them     the bent of the people does not seem to incline to honours of late          No  I thought they were always as good as ready money  especi    ally with those who have more money than sense  and
