it is Hylib bib  in the evening  received repeated intelligence that he was within half a league of a Chinese    225 general  at the head of a body of troops greatly superior in number to the Japonese forces which he himself commanded  He still believed it was all illusion  and when he heard their drums beat  declared it was no more than a ridiculous inchantment  He thought proper  however  to retreat towards the seaside  but this he did with great deliberation  after having given the enemy fair notice by beat of drum  His motions were so slow  that he took seven hours to march three miles  When he reached the shore where the Fune were at anchor  he saw the whole body of the Chinese drawn up on a rising ground ready to begin the attack  He ordered his rearguard to face about on the supposition that the phantoms would disappear as soon as they shewed their faces  but finding himself mistaken  and perceiving some of his own people    226 to drop  in consequence of missiles that came from the enemy  he very calmly embarked with his van  leaving his rear to amuse the Chinese  by whom they were  in less than five minutes  either massacred or taken  From this small disgrace the general deduced two important corollaries  first  that the Chinese were actually material beings capable of impulsion  and secondly  that his engineer s nose was not altogether infallible  The people of Meaco did not seem to relish the experiments by which these ideas were ascertained  The monster was heard to grunt in different streets of the metropolis  and these notes of discontent produced the usual effect in the bowels of Fika kaka  but orator Taycho had his flowers of rhetoric and his bowl of mandragora in readiness  He assured them that Hylib bib should be employed for the    227 future in keeping sheep on the island of Xicoco  and the engineer be sent to hunt truffles on the mountains of Ximo  Then he tendered his dose  which the Hydra swallowed with signs of pleasure  and lastly  he mounted upon its back  and rode in triumph under the windows of the astonished Cuboy  who  while he shifted his trowsers  exclaimed in a rapture of joy     All hail  Taycho  thou prince of monster taming men  the Dairo shall kick thy posteriors  and I will kiss them in token of approbation and applause      END of the FIRST VOLUME
