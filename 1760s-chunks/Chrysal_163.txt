this time           How  my dearest  best friend     said the doctor  catching his   hand  and kissing it in ecstacy    is my life safe   Is not the   wound mortal           Mortal 1 no    nor even dangerous   if the surgeons do not make   it so  Give me leave to put a plaster to it  which I always have     M         178 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     in readiness in the house  in case of accidents  as gentlemen often   quarrel for their women in their liquor   and I ll engage that it   shall give you no further trouble  Many a guinea have I got   by it  for  when any such things happen  I immediately slip on   a full trimmed suit  a bag wig  and a sword  which a surgeon   once pawned to me for a debt of two guineas  and up I go  do   the job  take my fee  and come away as good a surgeon as the   best   Never fear  sir   I ll insure you from this scratch        The consolation which this news gave the doctor is not to be   expressed  He hugged and kissed his dear friend  till he made   him in as bloody a condition as himself  and in the joy of his   heart even forgave the cause of his fears  who had all this time   counterfeited a swoon  But Momus  who saw his sport with the   doctor thus cut short  soon brought her to herself  for  taking   a glass of brandy  as if to hold to her nose  in the affected   awkwardness of his hurry and confusion he spilled it all over   her face  and then taking a bit of burnt paper  to try what   that would do  he designedly neglected to blow it out  and so   holding it to her nose  set the brandy he had spilled upon her   face on fire  This instantly awoke her from her swoon  She   shrieked out  when he  in the same affected confusion  flung the   basin of bloody water  in which the doctor s wound had been   washed  fuU in her face  This  indeed  quenched the flame  but   then it put her in a condition as dirty and disagreeable as that   of my master or the doctor  the consequence of which was    that the doctor could not refrain from bursting out a laughing       Well  my friend   said he  taking her by the hand   it is but   just that you should share in the effects of your own rashness    But let there be no more of it  We have both been in fault    perhaps  and so let us only be more cautious for the future    What I have suffered was done by design  and had like to have   been attended with dreadful consequences   yours is all accidental   and trifling        While the doctor was thus piously making peace  my master was   cleaning himself  and setting the room to rights  Momus assisted   the matron to cram half a dozen napkins down her bosom  to dry   the water he had bathed her with  which he performed with so well   acted an anxiety and care  that even she was deceived  and   attributed all that had happened to her to his confusion  and   being glad to get so well off an affair that might have ended so   much worse  she complied with the doctor s advances to a general   reconciliation  and so all things were restored to their former   harmony  As to the doctor s wound  by a ready presence of mind    he found a way to make an advantage of it  by telling his congre    gation next day  that he had received it from some of Momus s   gang  who had attempted to assassinate him  in revenge of the   contempt in which he had brought their master      Matters being thus happily settled  the rest of the night was   devoted to mirth  and concluded with a song in character by each   of the company  of which Momus s was the most humorous  my   master s the grossest  the matron s the loosest  and the doctor s   the most daringly profane   perhaps to obUterate the remembrance         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 179     of his late religious qualms  After this  the company broke up    â  when the doctor  having occasion for some money early in the   morning  borrowed a couple of pieces from my
