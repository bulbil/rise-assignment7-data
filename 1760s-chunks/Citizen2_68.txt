and been flattered into beauty  They have been prostituted to the gay luxurious villain  and are now turned out to meet the severity of winter  Perhaps  now lying at the doors of their betrayers  they sue to wretches whose hearts are insensible  or debauchees who may curse  but will not relieve them     212Why  why was I born a man  and yet see the sufferings of wretches I cannot relieve  Poor houseless creatures  the world will give you reproaches  but will not give you relief  The slightest misfortunes of the great  the most imaginary uneasinesses of the rich  are aggravated with all the power of eloquence  and held up to engage our attention and sympathetic sorrow  The poor weep unheeded  persecuted by every subordinate species of tyranny  and every law  which gives others security  becomes an enemy to them   Why was this heart of mine formed with so much sensibility  or why was not my fortune adapted to its impulse  Tenderness  without a capacity of relieving  only makes the man who feels it more wretched than the object which sues for assistance  Adieu   LETTER CXV  Fum Hoam to Lien Chi Altangi  the discontented wanderer  by the way of Moscow   I HAVE been just sent upon an embassy to Japan  my commission is to be dispatched in f•ur days  and you can hardly conceive the pleasure I shall find upon revisiting my native country  I shall leave with joy this proud  barbarous  inhospitable region  where every object conspires to diminish my satisfaction  and encrease my patriotism     213But tho  I find the inhabitants savage  yet the Dutch merchants who are permitted to trade hither  seem still more detestable  They have raised my dislike to Europe in general  by them I learn how low avarice can degrade human nature  how many indignities an European will suffer for gain   I was present at an audience given by the Emperor to the Dutch envoy  who had sent several presents to all the courtiers some days previous to his admission  but he was obliged to attend those designed for the Emperor himself  From the accounts I had heard of this ceremony  my curiosity prompted me to be a spectator of the whole   First went the pressents  set out on beautiful enamelled tables  adorned with flowers  borne on mens shoulders  and followed by Japonese music and dancers  From so great respect paid to the gifts themselves  I had fancied the donors must have received almost divine honours  But about a quarter of an hour after the presents had been carried in triumph  the envoy and his train were brought forward  They were covered from head to foot with long black vails  which prevented their seeing  each led by a conductor  chosen from the meanest of the people  In this dishonourable manner having traversed the city of Jedo  they at length arrived at the palace gate  and after waiting half an hour  were admitted into the guard room  Here their eyes were uncovered  and in about an hour the gentleman usher introduced them into the hall of audience  The Emperor was at length shewn sitting in a kind of Alcove at the upper end of the room  and the Dutch envoy was conducted towards the throne     214As soon as he had approach d within a certain distance  the gentleman usher cried out with a loud voice  Holanda Capitan  upon these words the envoy fell flat upon the ground  and crept upon his hands and feet towards the throne  Still approaching  he rear d himself upon his knees  and then bowed his forehead to the ground  These ceremonies being over  he was directed to withdraw  still groveling on his belly  and going backward like a lobster   Men must be excessively fond of riches  when they are earned with such circumstances of abject submission  Do the Europeans worship Heaven it self with marks of more profound respect  Do they confer those honours on the Supreme of beings  which they pay to a barbarous king  who gives them a permission to purchase trinkets and porcelaine  What a glorious exchange  to forfeit their national honour  and even their title to humanity  for a screen or a snuff box   If these ceremonies essayed in the first audience appeared mortifying  those which are practised in the second are infinitely more so  In the second audience  the Emperor and the ladies of court were placed behind lattices in such a manner as to see without being seen  Here all the Europeans were directed to pass in review  and grovel and act the serpent as before  with this spectacle the whole court seemed highly delighted  The strangers were asked a thousand ridiculous questions  as their names  and their ages  They were ordered to write  to stand upright  to sit  to stop  to compliment each other  to be drunk  to speak the Japanese language  to talk   215 Dutch  to sing  to eat  in short  they were ordered to do all that could satisfy the curiosity of women   Imagine  my dear Altangi  a set of grave men thus transformed into buffoons  and acting a part every whit as honourable as that of those instructed animals which are shewn in the streets of Pekin
