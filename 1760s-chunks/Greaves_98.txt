the loose cohesion of those material particles which constitute the nervous substance  inasmuch as the quantity of every effect must be proportionable to its cause  now you ll please to take notice  sir  if the case were really what these words seem to import  all bodies  whose particles do not cohere with too great a degree of proximity  would be nervous  that is  endued with sensation  Sir  I shall order some cooling things to keep you in due temperature  and you ll do very well—sir  your humble servant    So saying  he retired  and our adventurer could not but think it was very hard that one man should not dare to ask the most ordinary question without being reputed mad  while another should talk nonsense by the hour  and yet be esteemed as an oracle   The master of the house finding Sir Launcelot so tame and tractable  indulged him after dinner with a walk in a little private garden  under the eye of a servant who followed him at a distance  Here he was saluted by a brother prisoner  a man seemingly turned of thirty  tall and thin  with staring eyes  a hook nose  and a face covered with pimples   The usual compliments having passed  the stranger  without further ceremony  asked him if he would oblige him with a chew of tobacco  or could spare him a mouthful of any sort of cordial  declaring he had not tasted brandy since he came to the house  The knight assured him it was not in his power to comply with his request  and began to ask some questions relating to the character of their landlord  which the stranger represented in very unfavourable colours  He described him as a ruffian  capable of undertaking the darkest scenes of villany  He said his house was a repository of the most flagrant iniquities  That it contained fathers kidnapped by their children  wives confined by their husbands  gentlemen of fortune sequestered by their relations  and innocent persons immured by the malice of their adversaries  He affirmed this was his own case  and asked if our hero had never heard of Dick Distich  the poet and satirist   Ben Bullock and I   said he   were confident against the world in arms—did you never see his ode to me beginning with  Fair blooming youth   We were sworn brothers  admired and praised  and quoted each other  sir  We denounced war against all the world  actors  authors  and critics  and having drawn the sword  threw away the scabbard—we pushed through thick and thin  hacked and hewed helter skelter  and became as formidable to the writers of the age as the Boeotian band of Thebes  My friend Bullock  indeed  was once rolled in the kennel  but soon       He vig rous rose  and from th  effluvia strong       Imbib d new life  and scour d and stunk along    Here is a satire  which I wrote in an alehouse when I was drunk—I can prove it by the evidence of the landlord and his wife  I fancy you ll own I have some right to say with my friend Horace        Qui me commorit   melius non tangere clamo         Flebit  et insignis tota cantabitur urbe    The knight  having perused the papers  declared his opinion that the verses were tolerably good  but at the same time observed that the author had reviled as ignorant dunces several persons who had writ with reputation  and were generally allowed to have genius  a circumstance that would detract more from his candour than could be allowed to his capacity    D—n their genius   cried the satirist   a pack of impertinent rascals  I tell you  sir  Ben Bullock and I had determined to crush all that were not of our own party  Besides  I said before  this piece was written in drink  — Was you drunk too when it was printed and published  — Yes  the printer shall make affidavit that I was never otherwise than drunk or maudlin  till my enemies  on pretence that my brain was turned  conveyed me to this infernal mansion —   They seem to have been your best friends   said the knight   and have put the most tender interpretation on your conduct  for  waiving the plea of insanity  your character must stand as that of a man who hath some small share of genius  without an atom of integrity  Of all those whom Pope lashed in his Dunciad  there was not one who did not richly deserve the imputation of dulness  and every one of them had provoked the satirist by a personal attack  In this respect the English poet was much more honest than his French pattern Boileau  who stigmatised several men of acknowledged genius  such as Quinault  Perrault  and the celebrated Lulli  for which reason every man of a liberal turn must  in spite of all his poetical merit  despise him as a rancorous knave  If this disingenuous conduct cannot be forgiven in a writer of his superior genius  who will pardon it in you whose name is not half emerged from obscurity
