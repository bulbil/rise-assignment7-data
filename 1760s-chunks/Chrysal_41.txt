    ADVENTURES OF 4 GUINEA 25     say that thou tookest thy sister s jewels only to make a peace   offering for thy sins   â€” and then to secrete thus the most valuable   part of them  This is defrauding the labourer of his hire   This   is defrauding the Church of her right  without making the proper   compensations   And what can be greater sacrilege         Just at these words  a knocking at the gate awoke the penitent   from his amaze  and made him apprehend that he had not a minute   to lose   he therefore  with the readiest presence of mind  replied       The cruciiix  father   you astonish me   Did I not give it you       And then putting his hand into his bosom and pulling it out  with   A look of surprise he reached it to him    Forgive  oh  father    said he      the crime of inadvertency  I meant not to have kept it from you    but only overlooked it in my confusion  Accept it â€” accept all I    am master of  and save my life           Son    replied the father  softening his voice and taking the cruci    fix    I am glad thou wast not intentionally guilty of so unpardonable    an offence  I believe and accept thy excuse  Be comforted  there    fore  my son  thy sins are forgiven          Oh  but  father  the officers of justice           What officers  what justice  dares attempt to show her face   Tvithin these walls   Thou art my penitent   I have absolved thee   and I will defend thee  Sit down and compose thy spirits  while   I repel this bold intrusion on the peace and privilege of these holy   walls        Saying thus  the father went to the gate of the convent  where   cstood the judge  displaying the guilt of the fugitive to the holy   fathers  to engage them to refuse him sanctuary and give him up   to justice  But my master soon stopped him    Cease    said he   with a low voice  and downcast  meditative look    disturb not the   peace of these holy walls  The man you seek is my penitent  He   has made satisfaction to the Church  and reconciled himself to   Heaven  I come this moment from giving him the seal of absolu    tion  Disturb not the raptures of his soul  that is now joining with   the angelic choirs in the hymns of joy raised in heaven for his   repentance  Depart in peace          How  father    exclaimed the judge   can a wretch guilty of such   crimes so soon have made his peace   He has deceived you  father     he has not told you half his guilt â€” rape  incest  adultery and   murder   Can they be thus forgiven   So easy pardons but encourage   vice          And who art thou  presumptuous man    replied the father    raising his voice  and putting on an air of authority    and who art   thou  that darest thus to call the power of God s Holy Church in   question   What faith  or rather  what heresy has taught thee   this presumption   Dost thou measure the Divine authority of   our unerring tribunal by the weak rules of thy blind law   Are   not the keys of heaven ours   and have we not the power to loose   as well as bind   But I shall not argue more with thee here  There   is a tribunal proper for such opinions as thine   there try if thy   knowledge of the laws will justify thy heresies   there thou art not   judge        The first mention of heresy had struck such a terror into the heart         26 ADVENTURES OF A OUINEA     of the poor judge that he was for some moments unable to reply    At last  recollecting himself a little     I submit  oh  father    said he      I am no heretic   I have no opinions but what I learn from the   Holy Church  whose power I acknowledge in all its divine plenitude           Tis well    replied the priest     tis well   depart in peace  and   to morrow I will visit thee
