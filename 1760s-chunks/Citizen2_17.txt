country becomes most wise and happy  in which they most serve for instructors  The countries where sacerdotal instruction alone is permitted  remain in ignorance  superstition  and hopeless slavery  In England  where there are as many new books published as in all the rest of Europe together  a spirit of freedom and reason reigns among the people  they have been often known to act like fools  they are generally found to think like men   The only danger that attends a multiplicity of publications  is that some of them may be calculated to injure  rather than benefit society  But where writers are numerous  they also serve as a check upon each other  and perhaps a literary inquisition is the most terrible punishment that can be conceived  to a literary transgressor   But to do the English justice  there are but few offenders of this kind  their publications in general aim at mending either the heart  or improving the common weal  The dullest writer talks of virtue  and liberty  and benevolence with   48 esteem  tells his true story  filled with good and wholesome advice  warns against slavery  bribery  or the bite of a mad dog  and dresses up his little useful magazine of knowledge and entertainment  at least with a good intention  The dunces of France  on the other hand  who have less encouragement  are more vicious  Tender hearts  languishing eyes  Leonora in love at thirteen  extatic transports  stolen blisses  are the frivolous subjects of their frivolous memoirs  In England  if a bawdy blockhead thus breaks in on the community  he sets his whole fraternity in a roar  nor can he escape  even though he should fly to nobility for shelter   Thus even dunces  my friend  may make themselves useful  But there are others whom nature has blest with talents above the rest of mankind  men capable of thinking with precision  and impressing their thought with rapidity  Beings who diffuse those regards upon mankind  which others contract and settle upon themselves  These deserve every honour from that community of which they are more peculiarly the children  to such I would give my heart  since to them I am indebted for its humanity  Adieu   LETTER LXXIII  From Hingpo to Lien Chi Altangi  by the way of Moscow   I Still remain at Terki  where I have received that money which was remitted here in order to release me from captivity  My fair companion still   49 improves in my esteem  the more I know her mind her beauty becomes more poignant  she appears charming  even among the daughters of Ci•cassia   Yet were I to examine her beauty with the art of a statuary  I should find numbers here that far surpass her  nature has not granted her all the boasted Circassian regularity of feature  and yet she greatly exceeds the fairest of the country  in the art of seizing the affections  Whence  have I often said to myself  this resistless magic that attends even moderate charms  though I regard the beauties of the country with admiration  every interview weakens the impression  but the form of Zelis grows upon my imagination  I never behold her without an encrease of tenderness and respect  Whence this injustice of the mind in preferring imperfect beauty to that which nature seems to have finished with care  whence the infatuation  that he whom a comet could not amaze  should be astonished at a meteor  When reason was thus fatigued to find an answer  my imagination pursued the subject  and this was the result   I fancied myself placed between two landscapes  this called the region of beauty  and that the valley of the graces  the one adorned with all that luxuriant nature could bestow  the fruits of various climates adorned the trees  the grove resounded with music  the gale breathed perfume  every charm that could arise from symmetry and exact distribution were here conspicuous  the whole •••ering a prospect of pleasure without end  The v•lley of the graces on the other hand  seemed by   50 no means so inviting  the streams and the groves appeared just as they usually do in frequented countries  no magnificent parterres  no consort in the grove  the rivulet was edged with weeds  and the rook joined its voice to that of the nightingale  All was simplicity and nature   The most striking objects ever first allure the traveller  I entered the region of beauty with encreased curiosity  and promised myself endless satisfaction in being introduced to the presiding goddess  I perceived several strangers  who entered with the same design  and what surprised me not a little  was to see several others hastening to leave this abode of seeming felicity   After some fatigue  I had at last the honour of being introduced to the goddess  who represented Beauty in person  She was seated on a throne  at the foot of which stood several strangers lately introduced like me  all regarding her form in extasy  Ah  what eyes  what lips  how clear her complexion  how perfect her shape  at these exclamations Beauty with downcast eyes  would endeavour to counterfeit modesty  but soon again looking round as if to confirm every spectator in his favourable sentiments  sometimes she would attempt to allure us by smiles
