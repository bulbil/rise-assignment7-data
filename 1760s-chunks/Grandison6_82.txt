strictest truth  Sir Charles Grandison  It is Lucy s observation  as well as mine  addresses himself to women  as women  not as goddesses  yet does honour to the persons  and to the sex  Other men  not knowing what better to say  make Angels of them  all at once  The highest things are ever said by men of the lowest understandings  and  their bolts once shot  the poor souls can go no further  So silly —Has not your Ladyship some of these in your eye  who make out the rest  by grinning in our faces  in order to convince us of their sincerity  Complimental men don t consider  that if the women they egregiously flatter were what they would have them believe they think them  they would not be seen in such company   But what do you think the elder sister of the three   204 said of your brother —She was sure  those eyes  and that vivacity and politeness  were not given him for nothing  Given him for nothing  What a phrase is that  In short  she said  that practice had improved his natural advantages  This I have a good mind to say of her—Either she had not charity  or her heart has paid for enabling its mistress to make such an observation  Practice  What meant she by the word —Indeed your brother was not quite so abstractedly inattentive  I thought  to the Beauty of Miss Clarkson  but he might give some little shadow of ground for observation to a censorious person   I sometimes think  that  free and open as his eyes are  his character might suffer  if one were to judge of his heart by them  Lord L  I remember  once said  that Ladies abroad used to look upon him as their own man  the moment they beheld him —Innocently so  no doubt  and in their conversation assemblies  Poor Lady Olivia  I suppose  was so caught  at an unhappy moment  perhaps when her caution was half asleep  and she was loth to have it too rudely awakened  But ought I  your Harriet  to talk of this —Where was my caution  when I suffered myself to be surprised —O but my gratitude was my excuse  Who knows what Olivia might have to plead —We have not her whole story  you know  Poor Lady  I pity her  To cross the seas  as she did —Ineffectually   But can you bear this pen prattling  the effects of a mind more at ease than it ever expected to be   I will go down  Can I be so long spared  I am just thinking  that were I one of the creatures called Coquettes  the best way to attract attention  when it grew languid  is  to do as I do from zeal in writing to you—Be always going out and returning  and not staying long enough in a place to tire one s company  or suffer them to turn their eyes upon any body else  Did you ever try such an experiment  Charlotte  But   205 you never could tire your company  Yet I think you have a spice of that character in yours  Don t you think so  yourself —But don t own it  if you do—Hey day  What s the matter with me  I believe by my flippancy I am growing quite well  and as saucy as I used to be—Poor Lady Clementina  I wish she were happy  Then should I be so   MY dear Lady G  we had a charming conversation this day  My grandmamma and your brother bore the principal parts in it  It began with dress  and fashion  and such like trifling subjects  but ended in the noblest  You know my grandmamma s chearful piety  Sir Charles seemed at first only designing to attend to her wisdom  but she drew him in  O my dear  he seems to be  yet not to know it  as good a man  as she is a woman  Yet years so different —But austerity  uncharitableness  on one hand  ostentation  affectation  on the other  these are qualities which can have no place in his heart  Such a glorious benevolence  Such enlarged sentiments —What a happy  thrice happy woman  thought I  several times  must she be  who shall be considered as a partaker of his goodness  Who shall be blest not only in him  but for him  and be his  and he hers  to all eternity   My aunt once  in the conclusion of this conversation  said  How happy would it be  if he could reform certain gentlemen of this neighbourhood  And as they were so fond of his company  she hoped he would attempt it   Example  he answered  and a silent one  would do more with such men than precept  They have Moses  and the prophets  They know when they do wrong  and what is right  They would be afraid of  and affronted at  a man pretending to instruct them  Decency  from such men  is as much as can be expected  We live in such an age  added he  that I believe more   206 good may be done by seeming to
