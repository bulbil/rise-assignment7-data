will give you between my Lord and Sir Thomas  on this important subject  for you must believe  Lord L  could not permit a matter of such consequence to his own happiness to go easily off  especially as neither of the two daughters were able to stand their father s continual raillery  which had banished from the cautious eyes  and apprehensive countenances  of both Ladies  all indications of Love  tho  it reigned with the more absolute power in the heart of Miss Caroline  for that concealment   In this conversation  my Lord began with a little more spirit than he finished the former  The Countess lent me my Lord s minutes of it  which he took for her to see  and to judge of all that passed at the time   On my Lord s lively  but respectful address to Sir Thomas on the occasion  the Baronet went directly into the circumstances of my Lord  and his expectations     154 Lord L  told him frankly  that he paid interest for 15000 l  for sisters fortunes  three of whom were living and single  That he believed two of them would soon be advantageously married  and he should wish to pay them their portions on the day  and was contriving to do so  by increasing the incumbrance that his father had left upon the finest part of his estate  to the amount of 5 000 l  which  and his sisters fortunes  were all that lay upon a clear estate of 5 000 l  a year  After he had thus opened himself  he referred the whole to Sir Thomas s consideration   My advice  my Lord  is this  said the Baronet  That you should by no means think of marriage till you are clear of the world  You will have 10 000 l  to pay directly  You will have the interest of 10 000 l  more to pay  And you men of title  on your marriages  whather you like ostentation or not  must be ostentatious  Your equis  your houses  your furniture—A certain increase of expence—By no means  my Lord L  think of marriage till you are quite clear of the world  unless you could meet with some rich widow or heiress  who could do the business at once   Lord L  could only  at first  urge his passion   He durst not his daughter s affection and the happiness of both  which were at stake   Sir Thomas opposed discretion to that plea  Poor passion  Lucy  would be ashamed to see the sun  if discretion were always to be attended to  in treaties of this kind   Afterwards he told Sir Thomas  that he would accept the Lady upon his own terms  He besought his consent to their nuptials  He would wait his own time and pleasure  He would be content  if he gave not Miss Caroline a single shilling   Sir Thomas was fretful—And so  Lover like  you would involve the girl you profess to love  in difficulties  I will ask her  if she wants for any thing with me  that a modest girl can wish for  But  to be serious  it is a plaguy thing for a man to be obliged  by the officious   155Love  as it is called  of a pretender to his daughters  to open his affairs  and expose his circumstances to strangers  I wish  my Lord  that you had let my girls alone  I wish you had not found them out in their country retirement  I should have carried them to town  as I told you  in a few months  Women so brought up  so qualified  and handsome girls  are such rarities in this age  and men worth having are so affrighted at the luxury and expensiveness of the modern women  that I doubted not but the characters of my girls would have made their fortunes  with very little of my help  They have family  my Lord  to value themselves upon  tho  but spinsters  And let me tell you  since I shall be thought a more unnatural man than I am  if I do not obey the present demand upon me to open my circumstances  I owe my son a great deal more than 30 000 l   I don t understand you  Sir Thomas   Why  thus  my Lord  I explain myself  My father left me what is called rich  I lessen d the ready money  which he had got together for a purchase he lived not to complete  a great deal  That I looked upon as a deodand  So was not answerable for it  And as I was not married  my son had no right in it  When I was married  and he was given me—  Forgive me  Sir Thomas  Your son a right—And had not your other children—  No  my Lord  They were girls—And as to them  had I increased my fortune by penuriousness  instead of living like a man  I was determined as to their fortunes—  But  as I was saying  when Lady Grandison died  I think  tho  every father does not  nor should I  were he not the best of sons  and did he expect
