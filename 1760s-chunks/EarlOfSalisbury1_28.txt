friend  and will repay the cruel deed  O  there is a  blessed angel ever ready to present the cries of infant innocence  before the throne of justice  and to implore for vengeance on the arm  that hath been lifted against it —Seeks he our love  Mistaken lord   little dost thou conceive the fatal consequences of extorting a feigned  consent  when the heart is still estranged  Cold indifference  distaste   aversion  and loathing  ever watch round the bridal bed  and fright away  all joy and social comforts—Seeks he our possessions  —Take them  enjoy  them freely  and let us retire to some seat of humble obscurity  where  no curious eye shall ever pierce through our recess  where the name of  Salisbury was never known or uttered by the voice of Fame  There shall  my child labour with the lowly peasant  and never shall his mother  betray the secret of his birth  But if his blood must be the horrid  purchase—O let Raymond secure his power and riches beyond the reach of  time or fortune  Let me too perish  Drive not all mercy from your  hearts  but spare me the dreadful sight of my child s blood  No  let me  be made the first victim of your cruelty         Pity and humanity for a moment assailed the ruthless heart of Grey  but  soon were they repelled  He sternly answered  that she and her son might  yet be happy  that the conditions were easy and honourable  but that  disdain and pride were no good proofs of a mother s tenderness  that the  fortune of this boy was in her power  and that should he suffer  she  herself would be the author of his sufferings —Then calling the  attendants  he commanded them to remove young  William  His mother fell upon her knees  stretching out her trembling  arms in expressive silence  To her bosom the boy fled for refuge from  his infant terrors  she rose  and clasped him to her breast  devouring  the dear object with eyes of frantic fondness  The ministers of cruelty  relented and hesitated  but Grey severely repeated his command  They  surrounded the distracted mother and her weeping son  soon conquered  her feeble efforts to detain him  and tore him from her struggling  grasp  Her shrieks echoed through the castle  and wounded the  affrighted ear  till nature  harassed and exhausted by contending with  the vast affliction  lost its powers  and the Countess lay pale and  lifeless upon the ground  The tumult in her apartment had already  reached the ear of Raymond  who flew to enquire the cause  and now came  to be a witness of her distress  He soon learned the cause  and far from  approving the cruelty of his minion  he received him with frowns and  reproof  He ordered the female attendants to convey their afflicted lady  to her couch  and with all tender cares to recall her dying senses   Thither he himself soon followed  to restore her dear son  and to calm  her terrors  but she now had no ear for comfort  The fever had already  seized upon her  enflamed her eye  and raged in her boiling veins  Her  disordered fancy tormented her with killing images of terror  and his  presence added new force to her delirium  Raymond felt all the violence  of love and distraction  and Grey stood aghast  This subtile minion  laboured  first  to appease the resentment of his lord  and then to  give him comfort  He himself appeared most sollicitous for the recovery  of the Countess  although his wicked heart secretly exulted in her  present danger  Should she live  and at length consent to accept of  Raymond for a husband  his insolence must then be remembered  and his  lord taught to detest the author of her sufferings  Should she still  refuse to give her hand to Raymond  this lord could not long continue  his oppression  but must soon resign his unjust pretensions  and thus  dash all his own hopes of rich  rewards  Nay  possibly his conduct might hereafter meet a severe  punishment  Thus he reasoned  and regarded her death as an event highly  to be wished  An infant heir might easily be disposed of  and Raymond  invested with his rights without controul or opposition  Every hour  flattered his hopes with desperate accounts of Ela and her alarming  situation  His art was exerted to the utmost  to divert the attention  of Raymond from her distress  to alienate his mind from a woman who had  presumptuously insuited his passion  and to dazzle him with the gay view  of those fortunes which were now ready to crown his wishes  To inflame  the pride of this lord  was his artifice and flattery principally  directed  And  when he had warmed his imagination with prospects of  riches and magnificence  when he had worked up his pliant mind to the  due pitch of insolence and fierceness  he even dared to hint at the  necessity of defeating all future claims  and with hardened calmness  and indifference declared  that
