 Peters to keep it private  even from his own family  for a few days  Has   my girl any objection       O  sir  answered I  you are so generous in all your ways  I can have   no objections   But I hope Lady Davers and you will not proceed to   irreconcilable lengths  and when her ladyship comes to see you  and to   tarry with you  two or three weeks  as she used to do  I will keep close   up  so as not to disgust her with the sight of me       Well  Pamela  said he  we will talk of that afterwards  You must do then   as I shall think fit  And I shall be able to judge what both you and I   ought to do  But what still aggravates the matter is  that she should   instigate the titled ape her husband to write to me  after she had so   little succeeded herself  I wish I had kept his letter  that I might   have shewn you how a man  that generally acts like a fool  can take upon   him to write like a lord  But I suppose it is of my sister s penning    and he  poor man  is the humble copier          Tuesday       Mr  Thomas is returned from you  my dear father  with the good news   of your health  and your proceeding in your journey to my dear mother    where I hope to hear soon you are arrived  My master has just now been   making me play upon the spinnet  and sing to it  and was pleased to   commend me for both  But he does so for every thing I do  so partial   does his goodness make him to me          One o clock       We are just returned from an airing in the chariot  and I have   been delighted with his conversation upon English authors  poets   particularly  He entertained me also with a description of some of   the curiosities he had seen in Italy and France  when he made what the   polite world call the grand tour  He said he wanted to be at his other   seat  for he knew not well how to employ himself here  having not   proposed to stay half the time  And when I get there  Pamela  said he    you will hardly be troubled with so much of my company  after we have   settled  for I have a great many things to adjust  And I must go to   London  for I have accounts that have run on longer than ordinary with   my banker there  And I don t know  added he  but the ensuing winter I   may give you a little taste of the diversions of the town for a month   or so  I said  His will and pleasure should determine mine  and I never   would  as near as I could  have a desire after those  or any other   entertainments that were not in his own choice       He was pleased to say  I make no doubt but that I shall be very happy   in you  and hope you will be so in me  For  said he  I have no very   enormous vices to gratify  though I pretend not to the greatest purity    neither  my girl  Sir  said I  if you can account to your own mind    I shall always be easy in whatever you do  But our greatest happiness   here  sir  continued I  is of very short duration  and this life  at the   longest  is a poor transitory one  and I hope we shall be so happy as   to be enabled to look forward  with comfort  to another  where our   pleasures will be everlasting       You say well  Pamela  and I shall  by degrees  be more habituated to   this way of thinking  as I more and more converse with you  but  at   present  you must not be over serious with me all at once  though   I charge you never forbear to mingle your sweet divinity in our   conversation  whenever it can be brought in a propos  and with such   a cheerfulness of temper  as shall not throw a gloomy cloud over our   innocent enjoyments       I was abashed at this  and silent  fearing I had offended  But he said    If you attend rightly to what I said  I need not tell you again  Pamela    not to be discouraged from suggesting to me  on every proper occasion    the pious impulses of your own amiable mind  Sir  said I  you will be   always indulgent
