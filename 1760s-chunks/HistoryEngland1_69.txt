swollen to such a degree  that the country  on both sides  was deluged  and even the tops of mountains covered with water  It held ten days  during which the Welch army could neither pass the river  nor subsist on the other side  where they found nothing but desolation  at length  compelled by hunger  after having suffered a thousand hardships  they all dispersed  and returned   202 home  notwithstanding the Duke s intreaties so the contrary  In this helpless situation  the Duke  after a moment s reflexion  thought the properest place of safety he could fix upon  was at the house of one Banister  who had been his servant  and who had received repeated obligations from his family  No maxim was ever more just  than  that there is no friendship among the wicked  Buckingham had himself been first false to his King  and after to Richard  the creature of his own power  how then could he expect fidelity from others  A large reward was set upon the Duke s head  the villain Banister  unable to resist so great a temptation  went and betrayed his master to the Sheriff of Shropshire  who  surrounding the house with armed men  seized the Duke in a peasant s dress  and conducted him to Shrewsbury  where he was beheaded  without the form of a trial  or delay   In the mean time  Richmond landed in England  but  finding his hopes frustrated  by the catastrophe of Buckingham  he hastily set sail again  and returned to Bretagne  Richard  thus freed from the impending danger  gave a loose to cruelty  the favourite passion of his breast  In order to expedite his revenge  he gave one Ashton an unbounded commission to condemn and execute  upon the spot  such as were deemed by him guilty  or even suspected of guilt  A cruel King never wants a bloody minister  Ashton executed his commission with the utmost rigour  putting husbands to death in presence of their own wives  and children before the eyes of their parents  It is said  that  this execrable wretch being sollicited by a beautiful woman to release her husband  who was a prisoner upon suspicion  he consented  upon   203 her promising to grant him a favour of another nature  scarce had the poor creature indulged his brutal desire  when he brought her out  and pointed to her husband  whom  in the mean time  he had given orders should be hanged upon a neighbouring tree   Still  however  the authority of a parliament was wanting  to give sanction to the injustice of Richard s proceedings  but  in these times of vice and servility  that was soon procured  The parliament approved his proceedings  confirmed the illegitimacy of Edward s children  passed an act of attainder against the Earl of Richmond  and all his adherents  and seemed  upon the whole  more disposed to slavery  than he to be a tyrant  One thing more was yet wanting to complete his security  the death of his rival  to effect this  he sent ambassadors to the Duke of Bretagne  with whom Richmond had taken shelter  seemingly upon business of a public nature  but  in reality  to treat with Laudais  that Prince s prime minister  and to induce him to deliver up Richmond  The minister was base enough to enter into the negotiation  but Richmond  having had timely notice  fled away into France  and had just reached the limits of that kingdom  when his pursuers came up with him   Richard  finding his design of seizing his enemy s person without success  as his power became more precarious  became  every day  more suspicious and more cruel  Lord Stanley  who was now married to the widow of Edward IV  fell strongly under his suspicion  and  to secure his fidelity  he took the son as an hostage for his father s good behaviour  He now also resolved to get rid of his present Queen  in order to marry his   204 own niece  a match from which he expected to derive several advantages  The Lady he was then married to was formerly the wife of the young Prince of Wales  that was murdered by him at Tewkesbury  It is no slight indication of the barbarity of the times to find a woman thus taking the murderer of her husband for her second lord  She felt  however  the consequences of her ingratitude to the deceased Prince  in the inhumanity of the present  Richard treated her with so much contempt and indifference  that she died of grief  according to his desire  But his wishes were not crowned with success in his applications to his niece  she treated his vile passion with retaliated contempt and just detestation   In the perplexity  caused by this unexpected refusal  it was  that he received the news of Richmond s being once more landed at Milford haven  with an intent to deprive him of the crown  but  being informed that he brought with him but two thousand men  he seemed to despise the effort  and issued orders to oppose him with the greatest coolness and intrepidity  Richard was possessed of courage and military conduct  and these were his only virtues  Having heard
