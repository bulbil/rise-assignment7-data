husbands   Again the good girl wept at her mother s remembered remorse—My guar—my guardian s goodness  my mother said  had awakened her to a sense of her wickedness  My poor mother did not spare herself  And I was all sorrow  for what could I say to her on such a subject —And all the way that I came home in the coach  I did nothing but cry  I had but just dried my eyes  and tried to look chearful  when you came in  And then  when you told me the good news  something struck me all at once  struck my very heart  I cannot account for it  I know not what to liken it to—And had I not burst into tears  I believe it would have been worse for me  But now I am myself  and if my poor mother could pacify her conscience  I should be a happy creature—because of Miss Byron s happiness  You look at each other  Ladies  But if you think I should not  bid me be gone from your presence for a false girl  and never see you more   Now  Harriet  this emotion of Emily appears to me as a sort of phaenomenon  Do you account for it as you will  but I am sure Emily is no hypocrite  She has no art  She believes what she says  that her sudden burst of tears was owing to her heart being affected by her mother s contrition  And I am also sure that she loves you above all the women in the world  Yet it is possible  that the subtle thief  ycleped Love  had got very near her heart  and just at the moment threw a dart into one angle of it  which was the something that struck her  all at once  as she phrased it  and made her find tears a relief  This I know  my dear  that we may be very differently affected by the same event  when judged of at a distance  and near  If you don t already  or if you soon will not  experience the truth of this observation in the great event before you  I am much mistaken     35 But you see  Harriet  what joy this happy declaration of my brother  and the kind reception it has met with from Northamptonshire  has given us all  We will keep your secret  never fear  till all is over  and  when it is  you shall let my brother know  from the Letters we have had the favour of seeing  as much as we do  Till he does  excellent as he thinks you  he will not know one half of your excellencies  nor the merit which your Love and your Suspenses have made you with him   But  with you  I long for the arrival of the next Letters from Italy  God grant that Lady Clementina hold her resolution  now that she sees it is almost impossible for her to avoid marrying  If she should relent  what would be the consequence  to my brother  to herself  to you  And how shall all we  his friends and yours  be affected  You think the Lady is obliged  in duty to her parents  to marry  Lady L  and I are determined to be wise  and not give our opinions till the events which are yet in the bosom of Fate  disclosing themselves  shall not leave us a possibility of being much mistaken  And yet  as to what the filial duty requires of her  we think she ought to marry  Mean time  I repeat     God grant that Lady Clementina now hold her mind      LADY L  sends up her name  Formality in her  surely  I will chide her  But here she comes —I love  Harriet  to write to the moment  that s a knack I had from you and my brother  And be sure continue it  on every occasion  No pathetic without it   Your servant  Lady L   And your servant  Lady G —Writing  To whom   To our Harriet—  I will read your Letter—Shall I   Take it  but read it out  that I may know what I have written     36 Now give it me again  I ll write down what you say to it  Lady L   Lady  L  I say you are a whimsical creature  But I don t like what you have last written   Charlotte  Last written— Tis down —But why so  Lady L    Lady L  How can you thus teaze our beloved Byron  with your conjectural evils   Ch  Have I supposed an impossibility —But  tis down—Conjectural evils   Lady L  If you are so whimsical  write—   My dear Miss Byron—     Ch  My dear Miss Byron— Tis down   Lady L   Looking over me     Do not let what this strange Charlotte has written  grieve you —     Ch  Very well  Caroline —grieve you —  Lady L  Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof    Ch  Well observed —Words of Scripture  I believe —Well—evil
