margin of a clear fountain  between Valladolid and Segovia  I was with a journeyman barber  We had some provisions with us which we clubbed with yours  and all three partook of a little rural feast  to which wit and anecdote gave additional relish  Zapata bethought him for a minute or two  and then answered  You tell me of a circumstance which often since came across my mind  I had then just been trying my fortune at Madrid  and was returning to Zamora  I recollect perfectly that my affairs were a little out at elbows  I recollect it too  replied I  by the token of a doublet which you wore  lined with play bills  Neither have I forgotten that you complained of having a wife cursed with incorruptible chastity  Oh  that misfortune has found its remedy long ago  said Zapata  shaking his ears  By all the powers of womanhood  the jade has effectually reformed that virtue  and given me a warmer lining to my doublet   I was going to congratulate him on his wife s having shewn so much sense  when he was obliged to leave me and go on the stage  Being curious to know what sort of an animal his wife was  I went up to an actor and desired him to point her out  He did so  saying at the same time  There she is  it is Narcissa  the prettiest of all our women except your sister  I concluded that this must be the actress in whose favour the Marquis de Marialva had declared before meeting with his Estella  and my conjecture was but too correct  After the play I attended Laura home  where I saw several cooks preparing a handsome entertainment  You may sup here  said she  I will do no such thing  answered I  the marquis perhaps will like to be alone with you  Not at all  replied she  he is coming with two of his own friends and one of our gentlemen  you will just make the sixth  You know that in our free and easy way there is no impropriety in secretaries sitting down at table with their masters  Very true  said I  but it is rather too soon to assume the privilege of a favourite  I must first get employed in some confidential commission  and then lay in my claim to that honourable distinction  Judging it to be so best  I went out of Laura s house  and got back to my inn  whither I reckoned on repairing every day  since my master had no regular establishment       CH  IX     An extraordinary companion at supper  and an account of their conversation   I REMARKED in the coffee room a sort of an old monk  habited in coarse grey cloth  at supper quite alone in a corner  I went and sat opposite to him out of curiosity  we exchanged a civil bow  and he shewed himself to be quite as well bred as I was  notwithstanding my lay education  My commons were brought me  and I fell to with a very catholic appetite  While I was eating  my tongue was mute  but my eyes glanced by snatches towards this singular character  and always caught his at the same employment  Liking better to stare than be stared at  I addressed my speech to him thus  Pray  father  have we ever by any chance met anywhere but here  You peer at me as if you scarcely knew whether I was an acquaintance or a stranger  He answered gravely  If I look at you with fixed attention  it is only to admire the prodigious variety of adventures which are chronicled in the features of your face  It should seem  said I in a joking tone  as if your reverence was something of a physiognomist  Far more deeply imbued in science than a mere physiognomist  answered the monk  I found prophecies on my observations which have never been belied by the event  My skill in palmistry is no less  and I will set my oracles against the surest of antiquity  after comparing the inspection of the hand with that of the face   Though this old man had all the appearance of profound wisdom  his talk was so like that of a madman  that I could not help laughing at him out right  So far from being offended at my want of manners  he smiled at it  and went on to the following effect  after running his eye round the coffee room  to be assured that there were no listeners  I am not surprised at finding you so prejudiced against two sciences which pass at this time of day for mere frivolity  the long and painful study they require disheartens the learned  who turn their backs upon them  and then swear that they are fables out of disgust at having missed their attainment  For my part  I am not to be frightened by the darkness which envelopes them  any more than by the difficulties which are perpetual stumbling blocks in the pursuit of chemical discoveries  and in the marvellous art of transmuting baser metals into gold   But I do flatter myself  pursued he  looking steadfastly at me  that I am addressing a young gentleman of good sense  to whom my systems will not appear altogether in the
