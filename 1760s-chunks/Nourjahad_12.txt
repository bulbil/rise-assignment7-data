social joys of friendship be unremitting  I considered the world as a flower garden  the product of which was to delight my senses for a certain season  The bloom is not made to last  thought I   Page  73  but it will be succeeded by a fresh blow  whose sweetness and variety will equal the former  and intirely obliterate them from my memory  I thought not  alas  that before the spring ended  a cruel blast might suddenly destroy my fairest flower     Would you  my lord  said Hasem  if it were in your power  absolve your genius from his promise  seeing your life must be perpetually subject to such misfortunes     Not so neither  answered ← Nourjahad →   time is a never failing remedy for grief  I shall get over this  and be better prepared against the next assault of evil     Page  74  In effect  ← Nourjahad → kept his word  and soon returned to his former way of living     He had the mortification  however  to find himself still a prisoner  Hasem told him that the sultan had not yet taken off the restraint  under which he had formerly laid him  and whether it was through forgetfulness or design  the guards still maintained their posts about his house  This ← Nourjahad → was himself convinced of  by seeing them from his windows     It is strange  said he  that Schemzeddin should retain his resentment against me for so long a time  especially  Page  75  as he might have been convinced of the truth of what I asserted  by the extraordinary state in which I have lain all this while  You forget  my lord  said Hasem  that this was an absolute secret  no one from under your own roof knowing a word of the matter  Such was Mandana s last injunctions  and your faithful servants never divulged a tittle of it     Did not my friends come to visit me  said ← Nourjahad →   during that interval in which I slept  Those whom you called your friends  answered Hasem  came as usual  during the first month of your dormant state  but being refused admittance  under pretence that your health was so much declined  that you were  Page  76  not in a condition to receive them  they soon desisted from their visits  and finding they could no more be entertained with feasting and jollity  they have never since inquired after you     Ungrateful wretches  said ← Nourjahad →   I cast them off for ever  Yet it is an irksome thing to live without friends  You Hasem are a prudent and honest man  but still you are my servant  I cannot therefore consider you on that footing of equality which friendship requires  There is one man  said Hasem  who has shewn himself grateful and compassionate  and those two virtues never come alone  but are ever found attended with many others  Oh name  Page  77  him  said ← Nourjahad →   It is Zamgrad  replied Hasem  that officer of the sultan s whom you once obliged by a trifling present of a ring  he never fails sending every day to enquire after your welfare  Nay  he has often called himself  and expressed an honest sorrow for the ill state of health to which I told him you were reduced  tenderly blaming the sultan for his rigorous confinement of you     Worthy Zamgrad  said ← Nourjahad →   thou  thou alone shalt be the chosen friend of my heart  the rest of my worthless acquaintance I from this minute discard     Page  78  I will write to Schemzeddin  pursued he  perhaps he may now relent and restore me to my liberty  I long to shift the scene  and remove to some place where Mandana s image may not be so often revived in my memory  Wert thou not  Hasem  about to procure for me a noble seat in the country  which I was going to take a view of that day on which the good Zamgrad came to carry me before the sultan  If I might but retire thither  I should think myself happy     Alas  my lord  replied Hasem  that fine seat cannot now be your s  You may remember I made only a conditional  Page  79  agreement with the owner of it  depending on your approbation of the place after your having seen it  I recollect it  said ← Nourjahad →   but may it not still be mine  By no means  answered Hasem  the owner has long since disposed of it to another     That is unlucky  said ← Nourjahad →   but we can easily find another  Be it your care to look out for one  whilst I endeavour to move the sultan in my favour     Hasem was not slow in executing his master s orders  In three days he told him he had seen a villa  which seemed to him to surpass all the descriptions of  Page  80  Eden in its primary state of beauty  It is but at the distance
