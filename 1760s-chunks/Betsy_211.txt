  pomp and splendour your superior beauty merits  but neither my        virtue  my honour  nor my religion  will permit it  the mystery is        this            Upon examining into the cause why we see so many jarring pairs        united in the sacred yoke of matrimony  I found it wholly owing to        the want of that true affection which  to make perfect happiness         ought to precede the nuptial ceremony  that sordid interest  the        persuasion of friends  or some such selfish view  either on the        one side or the other  had given the hand without the heart  and        inclination had no share in beckoning to the altar            Being convinced of this truth by innumerable examples  and resolved        to avoid the fate of others  I made a vow  and bound myself by the        most solemn imprecations  never to marry any woman  how dear soever        she might be to me  that would not assure me of her love  by flying        privately with me to the altar  without consulting friends  or        asking any advice but of her own soft desires            This  my adorable charmer  being the case  I am certain you have        too high a sense of the duty owing to all that s holy  to exact        from me a thing which you cannot but be certain  must entail        eternal perdition on my perjured soul            Let us haste  then  to tie the blissful knot  and surprize our        friends with a marriage they little dreamt of  As Phoebus each        night hurries himself into the lap of Thetis  to render his        appearance the more welcome the next day  so shall the next morning        after our marriage behold us shine forth at once no less gorgeous        than the bright ruler of the day  dazzling the eyes of the admiring        world            I am fired with the imagination  and am wrapped in extasies        unutterable  but will fly this evening to your divine feet  where I        hope to persuade you to delay our mutual happiness no longer than        to morrow  and exchange my present appellation of lover into that of        husband  assuring yourself  I shall then be  as now  with the most        consummate devotion to your all conquering charms  sweet goddess of        my hopes  your passionate adorer  and everlasting slave            F  FINEER            P S  I beseech you will give necessary orders for preventing any        impertinent intruder from breaking in upon our converse  for         exclusive of my vow  I should detest  as the poet says                  With noise and shew  and in a crowd to woo             For true felicity dwells in two            Once more  my dear divinity  adieu        Miss Betsy read this letter over several times  and made herself   mistress of the sense  as she thought  of every part of it  she had   always found  in every thing he said or did  a great deal of the   affected and conceited coxcomb  but in this she imagined she discovered   more of the designing knave  the vow he mentioned was an excuse too   shallow to pass on a discernment such as hers  but her vanity still   suggesting that he was really in love with her  and that if he intended   any villainy towards her  it was enforced by the violence of his   passion  it came into her head  that there was a possibility of his   being already married  or contracted to some lady whom he durst not   break with  but being bent on gaining her at all events  he had formed   this pretence of a vow  in order
