she sent to her brother    that being obliged to go to a lady  who had desired to see her  she   could not wait for his coming to call on her  but would not fail to meet   him at the place of sale  about the hour he had mentioned  This promise   she thought it would be easy for her to perform  as she designed to stay   no longer with Miss Mabel than would be sufficient to get some light   into a thing which at present gave her so much perplexity       She went about eleven o clock  but was strangely surprized  on her   coming to the house  to find all the windows shut up  and after the   chairman had knocked several times  the door was opened by Nanny  the   little prating wench  who had lived at Mr  Goodman s    Nanny   cried   Miss Betsy   bless me  do you live here     Yes  Madam   answered she     I have lived here ever since my master Goodman died     I am glad of   it   returned Miss Betsy   but  pray  is your lady at home     O  dear   Madam   said the girl   my lady   why  Madam  don t you know what s done   to day     Not I   replied she   pr ythee what dost mean  What   done     Lord  Madam   said Nanny   I wonder you should not know it   my   lady is married today     Married   cried Miss Betsy hastily   to   whom     To one Sir Bazil Loveit  Madam   replied the other   and Mr    Trueworth is married too  to one Miss Harriot  Sir Bazil s sister  my   old master gave both the brides away  I believe the ceremony is over by   this time  but as soon as it is  they all bowl away for Sir Bazil s seat   in Staffordshire  they say there will be open house kept there  and the   Lord knows what doings  All the servants are gone  none but poor me left   to look after the house     Mr  Trueworth married   cried Miss Betsy  in   the greatest confusion   I thought his mistress had been dead     No    no  Madam   said Nanny   you mean Mrs  Blanchfield  I know all that   story  I was told it by one who comes often here  Mr  Trueworth  I   assure you  never courted her  she was only in love with him  and on   hearing his engagement with Miss Harriot  took it to heart  poor soul    and died in a few days  and has left him half her fortune  and a world   of fine things to Miss Harriot        She was going on with this tittle tattle  but Miss Betsy was scarce in a   condition to distinguish what she said  she leaned her head back against   the chair  and was almost fainting away  The maid perceiving the change   in her countenance  cried out   Lord  Madam  you are not well   shall I   get you any thing  But  now I think on it  there is a bottle of drops my   lady left behind her in the dressing room  I ll run and fetch them   She   was going to do as she said  but Miss Betsy  recovering of herself    called to her to stay  saying she had no occasion for any thing   Lord    Madam   said she   I did not think the marriage of Mr  Trueworth would   have been such a trouble to you  or I would not have told you any thing   of it  I am sure you might have had him if you would  I remember well   enough how he fought for you with Mr  Staple  and how he followed you up   and down wherever you went  For that matter  Miss Harriot has but your   leavings     I give myself no trouble who has him   replied Miss Betsy    disdainfully   it is not him I am thinking of  I was only a little   surprized that Miss Mabel should make such a secret of her affairs to   me     You know  Madam   said Nanny   that my lady is a very close   woman  but I wonder  indeed  she should tell you nothing of it  for I   have heard her speak the kindest things of you     Well  it is no   matter   replied Miss Betsy   Farewel  Nanny   Then bid the chairmen
