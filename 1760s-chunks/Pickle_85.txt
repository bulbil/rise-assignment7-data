his remembering and insisting upon  discharging the obligation  after such an interval of time  when the  whole affair was in oblivion  would be the greatest compliment he could  pay to his own honour and integrity     6 22 15  3 45 PM   Thus persuaded  he took an opportunity of Gauntlet s being alone with  him to broach the affair  telling the young man that his father had  advanced a sum of money for him  when they sailed together  on account  of the mess  as well as to stop the mouth of a clamorous creditor at  Portsmouth  and that the said sum  with interest  amounted to about four  hundred pounds  which he would now  with great thankfulness  repay   Godfrey was amazed at this declaration  and  after a considerable pause   replied  that he had never heard his parents mention any such debt  that  no memorandum or voucher of it was found among his father s papers   and that  in all probability  it must have been discharged long ago   although the commodore  in such a long course of time and hurry of  occupation  might have forgotten the repayment  he therefore desired to  be excused from accepting what in his own conscience he believed was  not his due  and complemented the old gentleman upon his being so  scrupulously just and honourable   The soldier s refusal  which was matter of astonishment to Trunnion   increased his inclination to assist him  and  on pretence of acquitting  his own character  he urged his beneficence with such obstinacy  that  Gauntlet  afraid of disobliging him  was in a manner compelled to  receive a draft for the money  for which he subscribed an ample  discharge  and immediately transmitted the order to his mother  whom  at the same time he informed of the circumstances by which they had so  unexpectedly gained this accession of fortune   Such a piece of news could not fail of being agreeable to Mrs  Gauntlet   who by the first post wrote a polite letter of acknowledgment to the  commodore  another to her own son  importing that she had already sent  the draft to a friend in London  with directions to deposit it in the  hands of a certain banker  for the purchase of the first ensigncy to be  sold  and she took the liberty of sending a third to Peregrine  couched  in very affectionate terms  with a kind postscript  signed by Miss Sophy  and his charming Emily   This affair being transacted to the satisfaction of all concerned   preparations were set on foot for the departure of our hero  on whom his  uncle settled an annuity of eight hundred pounds  being little less than  one half of his whole income  By this time  indeed  the old gentleman  could easily afford to alienate such a part of his fortune  because he  entertained little or no company  kept few servants  and was remarkably  plain and frugal in his housekeeping  Mrs  Trunnion being now some  years on the wrong side of fifty  her infirmities began to increase  and  though her pride had suffered no diminution  her vanity was altogether  subdued by her avarice   A Swiss valet de chambre  who had already made the tour of Europe  was  hired for the care of Peregrine s own person  Pipes being ignorant of  the French language  as well as otherwise unfit for the office of  a fashionable attendant  it was resolved that he should remain in  garrison  and his place was immediately supplied by a Parisian lacquey  engaged at London for that purpose  Pipes did not seem to relish this  disposition of things  and though he made no verbal objections to it   looked remarkably sour at his successor upon his first arrival  but this  sullen fit seemed gradually to wear off  and long before his master s  departure  he had recovered his natural tranquility and unconcern     6 22 15  3 45 PM   CHAPTER XXXI   The two young Gentlemen display their talents for Gallantry  in the  course of which they are involved in a ludicrous circumstance of  Distress  and afterwards take Vengeance on the Author of their Mishap   Meanwhile our hero and his new friend  together with honest Jack  Hatchway  made daily excursions into the country  visited the gentlemen  in the neighbourhood  and frequently accompanied them to the chase   all three being exceedingly caressed on account of their talents  which  could accommodate themselves with great facility to the tempers and  turns of their entertainers  The lieutenant was a droll in his way   Peregrine possessed a great fund of sprightliness and good humour  and  Godfrey  among his other qualifications already recited  sang a most  excellent song  so that the company of this triumvirate was courted  in all parties  whether male or female  and if the hearts of our  young gentlemen had not been pre engaged  they would have met with  opportunities in abundance of displaying their address in the art of  love  not but that they gave loose to their gallantry without much  interesting their
