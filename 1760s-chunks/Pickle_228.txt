sister in law  who was  there with the princess  and  upon these occasions  I never failed to  attract the notice of the company  who were struck with the appearance  of such a young creature in weeds  Nor was I free from the persecution  of professed admirers  but  being dead to all joy  I was deaf to the  voice of adulation    About Christmas I repaired to my father s house  where my sorrows were  revived by every object that recalled the idea of my dear lamented lord   But these melancholy reflections I was obliged to bear  because I had  no other home or habitation  being left an unprovided widow  altogether  dependent on the affection of my own family  During this winter  divers  overtures were made to my father by people who demanded me in marriage   but my heart was not yet sufficiently weaned from my former passion to  admit the thoughts of another master  Among those that presented their  proposals was a certain young nobleman  who  upon the first news of Lord  W   s death  came post from Paris  in order to declare his passion  He  made his first appearance in a hired chariot and six  accompanied by a  big fat fellow  whom  as I afterwards learned  he had engaged to sound  his praises  with a promise of a thousand pounds  in lieu of which he  paid him forty  Whether it was with a view of screening himself from the  cold  or of making a comfortable medium in case of being overturned  and  falling under his weighty companion  I know not  but  certain it is  the  carriage was stuffed with hay  in such a manner  that  when he arrived   the servants were at some pains in rummaging and removing it  before  they could come at their master  or help him to alight  When he was  lifted out of the chariot  he exhibited a very ludicrous figure to the  view  He was a thin  meagre  shivering creature  of a low stature  with  little black eyes  a long nose  sallow complexion  and pitted with  the smallpox  dressed in a coat of light brown frieze  lined with  pink coloured shag  a monstrous solitaire and bag  and  if I remember  right  a pair of huge jack boots  In a word  his whole appearance was  so little calculated for inspiring love  that I had  on the strength of  seeing him once before at Oxford  set him down as the last man on earth  whom I would choose to wed  and I will venture to affirm  that he was in  every particular the reverse of my late husband    As my father was not at home  he stayed but one evening  and left his  errand with my mother  to whom he was as disagreeable as to myself  so  that his proposal was absolutely rejected  and I heard no more of him  during the space of three whole months  at the expiration of which I  went to town  where this mortifying figure presented itself again  and  renewed his suit  offering such advantageous terms of settlement  that  my father began to relish the match  and warmly recommended it to my  consideration    Lord W   s relations advised me to embrace the opportunity of making  myself independent  All my acquaintance plied me with arguments to the  same purpose  I was uneasy at home  and indifferent to all mankind  I  weighed the motives with the objections  and with reluctance yielded to  the importunity of my friends  In consequence of this determination   the little gentleman was permitted to visit me  and the manner of his    6 22 15  3 45 PM   address did not alter the opinion I had conceived of his character and  understanding  I was even shocked at the prospect of marrying a man whom  I could not love  and  in order to disburden my own conscience  took  an opportunity of telling him  one evening  as we sat opposite to  each other  that it was not in my power to command my affection  and  therefore he could not expect the possession of my heart  Lord W   s  indulgence having spoiled me for a wife  nevertheless  I would endeavour  to contract a friendship for him  which would entirely depend upon his  own behaviour    To this declaration he replied  to my great surprise  that he did  not desire me to love him  my friendship was sufficient  and next  day repeated this strange instance of moderation in a letter  which I  communicated to my sister  who laughed heartily at the contents  and  persuaded me  that since I could love no man  he was the properest  person to be my husband    Accordingly  the wedding clothes and equipage being prepared  the  day  the fatal day  was fixed  on the morning of which I went to the  house of my brother in law  duke H    who loved
