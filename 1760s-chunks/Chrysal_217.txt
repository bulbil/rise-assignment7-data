OBEMAIfY    AND EXPLAINS THE MOTIVES OF THE SEVERAL PASTIES ENGAGED   IN IT  AS ALSO OP THE NETTTEALITY OBSEEVBD BY SOME PAETICT7LAB   STATES     The Jesuit the next evening resumed the conversation  and  to   remove every doubt of success that might deter his brother from   joining in his designs  proceeded thus   â€”       My brother    said he    there is nothing so disgusting to a rational   man as the mistakes and blunders which passion  prejudice  pride    and ignorance produce in the conduct of all the courts in the world    even ours at Rome not being quite exempt from them  though the   freest of all others  As for this of Vienna  it is at present a scene   where every absurd  every destructive passion rules  Among these   must you seek for the sources of the present war that lays all Ger    many waste  Female pride   piqued by some slighting expressions   from one esteemed inferior in rank  and stimulated by a desire of   recovering by surprise what had been yielded  or rather extorted    by treaty  influenced this sagacious court in conjunction with that   of Saxony  to form designs against the King of Bulgaria  But the   vigilance of that monarch prevented their designs  of which he had   timely notice  and  before their schemes were ripe for execution    he boldly attacked them  and so anticipated the blow meditated   against him        So daring a step surprised all Europe  and influenced many who   were unacquainted with the motives of it to take part against him    while more did for private advantage  Of these  France was the   first who  concluding a league with her ancient enemy  in despite    of family animosity  has entered into a war that seems not to con    cern her at all  nor  indeed  does it in the obvious consequences of   it  But she has further designs in view  and in return for the   assistance she gives to crush this prince  is to receive from the house   of Austria those dominions in the Netherlands  which have cost the   greatest part of Europe such deluges of blood for above a century   to keep out of her hands  while this court  inattentive to the conse    quences that must attend France s getting possession of these long    contested places has blindly  basely  entered into a league with a   family that has been labouring her ruin for so many ages  and   betrayed the confidence of all the states who supported her in them    The other nations who have acceded to this alliance have acted   from motives merely mercenary in the first view  fighting for the   pay promised them by the Imperial and French Courts  the latter     1 The allies of the Empress Miiria Theresa against Frerlerick of Prussia   were  Louis XV of France  the Czarina Elizabeth  and the King of   Poland  Elector of Saxony   The Czarina  like Madame de Pompadour    bad been embittered against Frederick by the coarae jibes of that con    firmed woman hater          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 247     of whom haa stretched her generosity so far as to undertake support    ing her new ally with money as well as men        But it is not improbable that they may all be disappointed  and   the King of Bulgaria not only escape the ruin meditated against   him  but also retort it on the machinators  one of the principal of   whom the Saxon   has already had abundant cause to repent of his   undertaking  As for this court  it now fights pro oris et focis  as   may be said   for if that hero is victorious  nothing less is to be   expected here than the total loss of the imperial dignity  of whose   authority there want not many instances of the most flagrant abuse    to vindicate such a  revolution  But of all the effects of this un    natural combination  there is not one more base than the ingratitude   with which this court has behaved to that of England  whose blood   and treasure have often supported it against the very power of   France  when every other human assistance has deserted it  and   established it in its present grandeur  almost at the price of its own   ruin  But now all those benefits are forgot   and because England   will not tamely look on  if not  perhaps  assist  to see the fabric   which she has erected at so vast an expense  overturned to gratify   a blind caprice  and a prince  allied to her by blood and interest    sacrificed by avarice and pride  all her
