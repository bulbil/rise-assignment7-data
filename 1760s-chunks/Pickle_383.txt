 The warden  who was a sensible and humane man  could  not help applauding his resolution  and several rooms being at that time  unoccupied  he put him immediately in possession of a couple  which were  forthwith prepared for his reception   This affair being settled to his satisfaction  he despatched Pipes for  his portmanteau  and  returning to the coffee house  found Peregrine   with whom he spent the remaining part of the evening  Our hero  taking  it for granted that he proposed to set out for the garrison next day   wrote a memorandum of some books which he had left in that habitation   and which he now desired Jack to send up to town by the waggon  directed  for Mr  Crabtree  He cautioned him against giving the least hint of  his misfortune in the neighbourhood  that it might remain  as long as  possible  concealed from the knowledge of his sister  who  he knew   would afflict herself immoderately at the news  nor reach the ears of  the rest of his family  who would exult and triumph over his distress   Hatchway listened to his injunctions with great attention  and promised  to demean himself accordingly  Then the discourse shifted to an  agreeable recapitulation of the merry scenes they had formerly acted  together  And the evening being pretty far advanced  Peregrine  with  seeming reluctance  told him that the gates of the Fleet would in a few  minutes be shut for the night  and that there was an absolute necessity  for his withdrawing to his lodging  Jack replied  that he could not  think of parting with him so soon  after such a long separation  and  that he was determined to stay with him an hour or two longer  if he  should be obliged to take up his lodging in the streets  Pickle  rather  than disoblige his guest  indulged him in his desire and resolved to    6 22 15  3 45 PM   give him a share of his own bed  A pair of chickens and asparagus were  bespoke for supper  at which Pipes attended with an air of internal  satisfaction  and the bottle was bandied about in a jovial manner till  midnight  when the lieutenant rose up to take his leave  observing   that  being fatigued with riding  he was inclined to turn in  Pipes   upon this intimation  produced a lanthorn ready lighted  and Jack   shaking his entertainer by the hand  wished him good night  and promised  to visit him again betimes in the morning   Peregrine  imagining that his behaviour proceeded from the wine  which  he had plentifully drunk  told him  that  if he was disposed to sleep   his bed was ready prepared in the room  and ordered his attendant to  undress his master  upon which Mr  Hatchway gave him to understand  that  he had no occasion to incommode his friend  having already provided a  lodging for himself  and the young gentleman demanding an explanation   he frankly owned what he had done  saying   You gave me such a dismal  account of the place  that I could not think of leaving you in it  without company   Our young gentleman  who was naturally impatient  of benefits  and foresaw that this uncommon instance of Hatchway s  friendship would encroach upon the plan which he had formed for his own  subsistence  by engrossing his time and attention  so as that he should  not be able to prosecute his labours  closeted the lieutenant next day   and demonstrated to him the folly and ill consequences of the step he  had taken  He observed  that the world in general would look upon it as  the effect of mere madness  and  if his relations were so disposed  they  might make it the foundation for a statute of lunacy against him  that  his absence from the garrison must be a very great detriment to his  private affairs  and  lastly  that his presence in the Fleet would be  a very great hindrance to Pickle himself  whose hope of regaining his  liberty altogether depended upon his being detached from all company and  interruption   To these remonstrances Jack replied  that  as to the opinion of  the world  it was no more to him than a rotten net line  and if his  relations had a mind to have his upper works condemned  he did not doubt  but he should be able to stand the survey  without being declared unfit  for service  that he had no affairs at the garrison  but such as  would keep cold  and with regard to Pickle s being interrupted by his  presence  he gave him his word  that he would never come alongside of  him  except when he should give him the signal for holding discourse   In conclusion  he signified his resolution to stay where he was  at all  events  without making himself accountable to any person  whatsoever   Peregrine seeing him determined  desisted from any further importunity   resolving  however  to tire him out of his plan by reserve and
