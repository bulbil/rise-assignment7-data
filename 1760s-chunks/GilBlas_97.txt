I know what accident has befallen you  and am surprised  I own  at your forbearance  You are certainly acting a part  Sire  answered I  how can I know whom to challenge  I was attacked in the night by persons unknown  it is a misfortune of which I must make the best  No  no  replied the King  I am not to be duped by these evasive answers  The whole story has reached my ears  The Duke d Almeyda has touched your honour to the quick  You are nobly born  and a Castilian  I know what that double character requires  You cherish hostile designs  Admit me a party to your purposes  it must be so  Never fear the consequences of making me your confidant   Since your majesty commands it  resumed I  my sentiments shall be laid open without reserve  Yes  sir  I meditate a severe retribution  Every man  wearing such a name as mine  must account for its untarnished lustre with his family  You know the unworthy treatment I have experienced  and I purpose assassinating the Duke d Almeyda  as a mode of revenge correspondent to the injury  I shall plunge a dagger in his bosom  or shoot him through the head  and escape  if I can  into Spain  This is my design   It is violent  said the King  and yet I have little to say against it  after the provocation which the Duke d Almeyda has given you  He is worthy of the punishment you destine for him  But do not be in a hurry with your project  Leave me to devise a method of bringing you together again as friends  Oh  sir  exclaimed I with vexation  why did you extort my secret from me  What expedient can         If mine is not to your satisfaction  interrupted he  you may execute your first intention  I do not mean to abuse your confidence  I shall not implicate your honour  so rest contented on that head   I was greatly puzzled to guess by what means the King designed to terminate this affair amicably  but thus it was  He sent to speak with the Duke d Almeyda in private  Duke  said he  you have insulted Don Pompeyo de Castro  You are not ignorant that he is a man of noble birth  a soldier who has served with credit  and stands high in my favour  You owe him reparation  I am not of a temper to refuse it  answered the Duke  If he complains of my outrageous behaviour  I am ready to justify it by the law of arms  Some thing very different must be done  replied the King  a Spanish gentleman understands the point of honour too well to fight on equal terms with a cowardly assassin  I can use no milder term  and you can only atone for the heinousness of your conduct  by presenting a cane in person to your antagonist  and offering to submit yourself to its discipline  Oh heaven  exclaimed the Duke  what  sir  would you have a man of my rank degrade  debase himself before a simple gentleman  and submit to be caned  No  replied the monarch  I will oblige Don Pompeyo to promise not to touch you  Only offer him the cane  and ask his pardon  that is all I require from you  And that is too much  sir  interrupted the Duke d Almeyda warmly  I had rather remain exposed to all the secret machinations of his resentment  Your life is dear to me  said the king  and I should wish this affair to have no bad consequences  To terminate it with less disgust to yourself  I will be the only witness of the satisfaction which I order you to offer to the Spaniard   The King was obliged to stretch his influence over the Duke to the utmost  before he could induce him to so mortifying a step  However  the peremptory monarch effected his purpose  and then sent for me  He related the particulars of his conversation with my enemy  and inquired if I should be content with the stipulated reparation  I answered  yes  and gave my word that  far from striking the offender  I would not even accept the cane  when he presented it  With this understanding  the Duke and myself at a certain hour attended the King  who took us into his closet  Come  said he to the Duke  acknowledge your fault  and deserve to be forgiven by the humility of your contrition  Then my antagonist made his apology  and offered me the cane in his hand  Don Pompeyo  said the monarch unexpectedly  take the cane  and let not my presence prevent you from doing justice to your outraged honour  I release you from your promise not to strike the Duke  No  sir  answered I  it is enough that he has submitted to the indignity of the offer  an offended Spaniard asks no more  Well  then  replied the King  since you are content with this satisfaction  you may both of you at once assume the privilege of a gentlemanly quarrel  Measure your swords  and discuss the question honourably  It is what I most ardently desire
