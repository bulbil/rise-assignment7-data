s   wife and daughters a good sad coloured stuff  of their own spinning    enough to make me a gown and two petticoats  and I made robings and   facings of a pretty bit of printed calico I had by me       I had a pretty good camblet quilted coat  that I thought might do   tolerably well  and I bought two flannel undercoats  not so good as   my swanskin and fine linen ones  but what will keep me warm  if any   neighbour should get me to go out to help  em to milk  now and then  as   sometimes I used to do formerly  for I am resolved to do all your good   neighbours what kindness I can  and hope to make myself as much beloved   about you  as I am here       I got some pretty good Scotch cloth  and made me  of mornings and   nights  when nobody saw me  two shifts  and I have enough left for two   shirts  and two shifts  for you my dear father and mother  When I come   home  I ll make them for you  and desire your acceptance       Then I bought of a pedlar  two pretty enough round eared caps  a little   straw hat  and a pair of knit mittens  turned up with white calico  and   two pair of ordinary blue worsted hose  that make a smartish appearance    with white clocks  I ll assure you  and two yards of black riband for my   shift sleeves  and to serve as a necklace  and when I had  em all   come home  I went and looked upon them once in two hours  for two days   together  For  you must know  though I be with Mrs  Jervis  I keep my   own little apartment still for my clothes  and nobody goes thither but   myself  You ll say I was no bad housewife to have saved so much money    but my dear good lady was always giving me something       I believed myself the more obliged to do this  because  as I was turned   away for what my good master thought want of duty  and as he expected   other returns for his presents  than I intended to make him  so I   thought it was but just to leave his presents behind me when I went   away  for  you know  if I would not earn his wages  why should I have   them       Don t trouble yourself about the four guineas  nor borrow to make   them up  for they were given me  with some silver  as I told you  as a   perquisite  being what my lady had about her when she died  and  as I   hope for no wages  I am so vain as to think I have deserved all that   money in the fourteen months  since my lady s death  for she  good soul    overpaid me before  in learning and other kindnesses  Had she lived    none of these things might have happened   But I ought to be thankful    tis no worse  Every thing will turn about for the best  that s my   confidence       So  as I was saying  I have provided a new and more suitable dress  and   I long to appear in it  more than ever I did in any new clothes in   my life  for then I shall be soon after with you  and at ease in my   mind  But  mum  Here he comes  I believe   I am  etc                LETTER XXI         MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER       I was forced to break off  for I feared my master was coming  but it   proved to be only Mrs  Jervis  She said  I can t endure you should be   so much by yourself  Pamela  And I  said I  dread nothing so much as   company  for my heart was up at my mouth now  for fear my master was   coming  But I always rejoice to see dear Mrs  Jervis       Said she  I have had a world of talk with my master about you  I am   sorry for it  said I  that I am made of so much consequence as to be   talked of by him  O  said she  I must not tell you all  but you are of   more consequence to him than you think for          Or wish for  said I  for the fruits of being of consequence to him    would make me of none to myself  or any body else
