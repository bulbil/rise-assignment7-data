threw myself on the little bed  not so much for rest as meditation  O heaven  exclaimed I  was there ever a fate so dreadful as mine  it is determined then I am to take my leave of daylight  Beside this  as if it were not enough to be buried alive at eighteen  my misery is to be aggravated by being in the service of a banditti  by passing the day with highwaymen  and the night in a charnelhouse  These reflections  which seemed to me very dismal  and were indeed no better than they seemed  set me crying most bitterly  I could not conceive what cursed maggot my uncle had got in his head to send me to Salamanca  repented running away from Cacabelos  and would have compounded for the torture  But  considering how vain it was to shut the door when the steed was stolen  I determined  instead of lamenting the past  to hit upon some expedient for making my escape  What  thought I  is it impossible to get off  The cut throats are asleep  cooky and the black will be snoring ere long  Why cannot I  by the help of this lamp  find the passage by which I descended into these infernal regions  I am afraid  indeed  my strength is not equal to lifting the trap at the entrance  However  let us see  Faint heart never won fair lady  Despair will lend me new force  and who knows but I may succeed   Thus was the train laid for a grand attempt  I got up as soon as Leonarda and Domingo were likely to be asleep  With the lamp in my hand  I stole out of the vault  putting up my prayers to all the spirits in paradise  and ten miles round  It was with no small difficulty that I threaded all the windings of this new labyrinth  At length I found myself at the stable door  and perceived the passage which was the object of my search  Pushing on I made my way towards the trap with a light pair of heels and a beating heart  but  alas  in the middle of my career I ran against a cursed iron grate locked fast  with bars so close as not to admit a hand between them  I looked rather foolish at the occurrence of this new difficulty  which I had not been aware of at my entrance  because the grate was then open  However  I tried what I could do by fumbling at the bars  Then for a peep at the lock  or whether it could not be forced  When all at once my poor shoulders were saluted with five or six good strokes of a bull s pizzle  I set up such a shrill alarum  that the den of Cacus rang with it  when looking round  who should it be but the old negro in his shirt  holding a dark lanthorn in one hand  and the instrument of my punishment in the other  Oh  ho  quoth he  my merry little fellow  you will run away  will you  No  no  you must not think to set your wits against mine  I heard you all the while  You thought you should find the grate open  did not you  You may take it for granted  my friend  that henceforth it will always be shut  When we keep any one here against his will  he must be a cleverer fellow than you to make his escape   In the mean time  at the howl I had set up two or three of the robbers waked suddenly  and not knowing but the holy brotherhood might be falling upon them  they got up and called their comrades  Without the loss of a moment all were on the alert  Swords and carabines were put in requisition  and the whole posse advanced forward almost in a state of nature to the place where I was parleying with Domingo  But as soon as they learned the cause of the uproar  their alarm resolved itself into a peal of laughter  How now  Gil Blas  said the apostate son of the church  you have not been a good six hours with us  and are you tired of our company already  You must have a great objection to retirement  Why  what would you do if you were a Carthusian friar  Get along with you  and go to bed  This time you shall get off with Domingo s discipline  but if you are ever caught in a second attempt of the same kind  by Saint Bartholomew  we will flay you alive  With this hint he retired  and the rest of the party went back to their rooms  The old negro  taking credit to himself for his vigilance  returned to his stable  and I found my way back to my charnel house  where I passed the remainder of the night in weeping and wailing       CH  VII     Gil Blas  not being able to do what he likes  does what he can   FOR the first few days I thought I should have given up the ghost for very spite and vexation  The lingering life I led was nearly akin to death itself  but in the end my good genius whispered me to play the
