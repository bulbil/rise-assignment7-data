vent  and I felt at that moment so strong an affection for Don Alphonso  that I could willingly have turned my back on the archbishop and all the fine prospects that were opening to me  and have gone back to the castle of Leyva  had but a mortification taken place in the back of the scarecrow which had frightened me away  Don Ferdinand was not insensible to the emotions that agitated me  and felt himself so much obliged by them  that he took his leave with the assurance of the whole family always taking an anxious interest in my fate   Two months after this worthy gentleman had left us  in the luxuriant harvest of my highest favour  a lowering storm came suddenly over the episcopal palace  the archbishop had a stroke of apoplexy  By dint of immediate applications and good nursing  in a few days there was no bodily appearance of disease remaining  But his reverend intellects did not so easily recover from their lethargy  I could not help observing it to myself in the very first discourse that he composed  Yet there was not such a wide gap between the merits of the present and the former ones  as to warrant the inference that the sun of oratory was many degrees advanced in its post meridian course  A second homily was worth waiting for  because that would clearly determine the line of my conduct  Alas  and well a day  when that second homily came  it was a knock down argument  Sometimes the good prelate moved forward  and sometimes he moved backwards  sometimes he mounted up into the garret  and sometimes dipped down into the cellar  It was a composition of more sound than meaning  something like a superannuated schoolmaster s theme  when he attempts to give his boys more sense than he possesses of his own  or like a capuchin s sermon  which only scatters a few artificial flowers of paltry rhetoric over a barren desert of doctrine   I was not the only person whom the alteration struck  The audience at large  when he delivered it  as if they too had been pledged to watch the advances of dotage  said to one another in a whisper all round the church    Here is a sermon  with symptoms of apoplexy in every paragraph  Come  my good Coryphaeus of the public taste in homilies  said I then to myself prepare to do your office  You see that my lord archbishop is going very fast     you ought to warn him of it  not only as his bosom friend  on whose sincerity he relies  but lest some blunt fellow should anticipate you  and bolt out the truth in an offensive manner  In that case you know the consequence  you would be struck out of his will  where no doubt you have a more convertible bequest than the licentiate SÃ©dillo s library   But as reason  like Janus  looks at things with two faces  I began to consider the other side of the question  the hint seemed difficult to wrap up so as to make it palatable  Authors in general are stark mad on the subject of their own works  and such an author might be more testy than the common herd of the irritable race  but that suspicion seemed illiberal on my part  for it was impossible that my freedom should he taken amiss  when it had been forced upon me by so positive an injunction  Add to this  that I reckoned upon handling the subject skilfully  and cramming discretion down his throat like a high seasoned epicurean dish  After all my pro and con  finding that I risked more by keeping silence than by breaking it  I determined to venture on the delicate duty of speaking my mind   Now there was but one difficulty  a difficulty indeed  how to open the business  Luckily the orator himself extricated me from that embarrassment  by asking what they said of him in the world at large  and whether people were tolerably well pleased with his last discourse  I answered that there could be but one opinion about his homilies  but that it should seem as if the last had not quite struck home to the hearts of the audience  like those which had gone before  Do you really mean what you say  my friend  replied he  with a sort of wriggling surprise  Then my congregation are more in the temper of Aristarchus than of Longinus  No  may it please your grace  rejoined I  quite the contrary  Performances of that order are above the reach of vulgar criticism  there is not a soul but expects to be saved by their influence  Nevertheless  since you have made it my duty to be sincere and unreserved  I shall take the liberty of just stating that your last discourse is not written with quite the overpowering eloquence and conclusive argument of your former ones  Does not your grace feel just as I do on the subject   This ignorant and stupid frankness of mine completely blanched my master s cheek  but he forced a fretful smile  and said    Then  good Master Gil Blas  that piece does not exactly hit your fancy  I did not mean to say that  your grace  interrupted I  looking very foolish  It is very far superior to what any one else could produce
