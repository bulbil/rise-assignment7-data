being in possession of a large estate  was determined to have the handsomest mistress that could be met with  and for that reason rejoiced at this fortunate rencounter     30Miss ELLIOT  whose person and disposition were entirely formed for a lady of pleasure  and who was remarkable for never remaining long in one place  without gaining a particular admirer  could not fail of engaging the heart of Sir THOMAS—  who from that time took her into keeping   He hired her a house near St  James s square  where they lived in great splendor  She frequented all the public places  sometimes with her keeper  and sometimes with a female acquaintance  for she was acquainted with several  who were all of her own profession  She had several frolics in gallantry unknown to Sir THOMAS  who did not confine himself to her alone  but frequently passed an evening with some other lady of his acquaintance  It was certainly noble and generous in him to indulge his mistress  while he did so himself  as well as acting perfectly conformable to the golden rule     31Miss ELLIOT took care to make good use of her liberty  and  for frolic s sake  would sometimes disguise herself in boy s cloaths  and in that habit go into public places  Thus dressed  she had the air of a complete petit maitre  and with the greatest ease imaginable assumed their tone and manner  Happening to go to the opera one evening  she met with a young musqueteer  who wore a gold laced hat with a white feather in it  and was dressed in a suit of white and gold  He seemed struck with her person  and both before the curtain was drawn up  and between the acts  addressed himself to her with an affected air of politeness  The piece being ended  he invited her to his lodgings  where they had not been long  before by some accident or other  he became acquainted with her sex  however  he was far from availing himself of this discovery  according to her expectations  she soon found that he was one of those fribbles  who have neither power nor spirit to enjoy what constitutes the chief pleasure of the more manrly part of the creation     32Of this insignificant race there are many who profe•s the highest c••tempt for women  and are enamoured of their dear selves alone  yet in despising women they may be said to despise themselves  as seemingly they want nothing but the dress to be complete females  yet despicable as these beings are  there are too many of them in this great metropolis   Miss ELLIOT had not long lived in this round of pleasures  before a period was put to them by the death of Sir Thomas  who was killed in a duel by a French gentleman  whom he had provoked by asserting the superiority of the English over the French  in point of government and political administration   She was afterwards kept by a Dutch merchant  whose constant jealousy was altogether insupportable to her  and the confined manner in which she lived with him  made her regret the liberty she had enjoyed even at a bagnio  Though he had nothing engaging in him  she was under a necessity of being true to him  as she   33 dreaded his furious temper  should he detect her in an affair with any other person  She therefore resolved on leaving him as soon as fortune should throw some other more agreeable lover in her way   Miss ELLIOT  whose charms were too engaging to suffer her to remain long without a lover  soon found one  who excepting the deficiency of the one thing necessary  viz  a large fortune  was endued with every qualification capable of rendering any woman completely blest  This gentleman s name was M—y  he was about thirty  genteel both in his person and address  He became so passionately fond of Miss ELLIOT  that every hour which was not spent in her company was to him an age  her vivacity and natural good breeding had inspired him with an irresistable passion for her  he indulged her in every thing that could pamper female pride  or inslame her vanity  Her new keeper being an actor at one of the theatres  she constantly frequented the playhouse   till at length she began to entertain a conceit of her dramatic talents  and being not a little humoured in the   34 same by her acquaintance  she determined to apply herself to the study of acting  in order to submit her capacity to the determination of the managers   To qualify herself for the arduous task  she attended particularly to the manner  action  and emphasis used by the most celebrated performers in their capital parts  and as soon as she returned home  would repeat the most striking passages  and endeavour to imitate what she had just seen represented  Her keeper also assisted in perfecting her for this new undertaking  and he succeeded so well  that she at last became one of the most eminent in her profession  and the part of MARIA  in the c••••rated farce THE CITIZEN  was wrote on purpose for her  which she filled with a degree of applause fearce ever bestowed on any stage heroine   But to proceed regularly  When she imagined she had sufficiently qualified herself  and
