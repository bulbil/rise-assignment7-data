 I bore my misfortune like a British man  and a  Christian  For why  He s no better than a fresh water sailor  who knows  not how to stem the current of mischance    Pickle being waked from a pleasant dream  in which the fair Emilia was  principally concerned  and hearing this strange preamble  sat up in his  bed  and unsealed the letter  in a state of mortification and disgust   But what were the emotions of his soul  when he read the following  intimation       6 22 15  3 45 PM        Dear Brother   It hath pleased God to take your father       suddenly off by a fit of apoplexy  and as he has died       intestate  I give you this notice  that you may  with all       speed  come down and take possession of your right  in       despite of Master Gam and his mother  who  you may be sure        do not sit easy under this unexpected dispensation of       Providence  I have  by virtue of being a justice of the       peace  taken such precautions as I thought necessary for       your advantage  and the funeral shall be deferred until       your pleasure be known  Your sister  though sincerely       afflicted by her father s fate  submits to the will of       Heaven with laudable resignation  and begs you will set       out for this place without delay  in which request she is       joined by  sir  your affectionate brother  and humble       servant                           Charles Clover    Peregrine at first looked upon this epistle as a mere illusion of the  brain  and a continuation of the reverie in which he had been engaged   He read it ten times over  without being persuaded that he was actually  awake  He rubbed his eyes  and shook his head  in order to shake off  the drowsy vapours that surrounded him  He hemmed thrice with great  vociferation  snapped his fingers  tweaked his nose  started up from his  bed  and  opening the casement  took a survey of the well known  objects that appeared on each side of his habitation  Everything seemed  congruous and connected  and he said within himself   Sure this is the  most distinct dream that ever sleep produced   Then he had recourse  again to the paper  which he carefully perused  without finding any  variation from his first notion of the contents   Hatchway  seeing all his extravagances of action  accompanied with a  wild stare of distraction  began to believe that his head was at length  fairly turned  and was really meditating means for securing his person   when Pickle  in a tone of surprise  exclaimed   Good God  am I or am I  not awake     Why look ye  cousin Pickle   replied the lieutenant   that  is a question which the deep sea line of my understanding is not long  enough to sound  but howsomever  thof I can t trust to the observation  I have taken  it shall go hard but I will fall upon a way to guess  whereabouts we are   So saying  he lifted up a pitcher full of cold  water  that stood behind the outward door  and discharged it in the face  of Peregrine without ceremony or hesitation  This remedy produced the  desired effect  Unpalatable as it was  the young gentleman no sooner  recovered his breath  which was endangered by such a sudden application   than he thanked his friend Jack for the seasonable operation he had  performed  Having no longer any just reason to doubt the reality of  what appeared so convincingly to his senses  he shifted himself on the  instant  not without hurry and trepidation  and  putting on his morning  dress  sallied forth to the Bare  in order to deliberate with himself on  the important intelligence he had received   Hatchway  not yet fully convinced of his sanity  and curious to know the  purport of the letter  which had affected him in such an extraordinary  manner  carefully attended his footsteps in this excursion  in hope  of being favoured with his confidence  in the course of their  perambulation  Our hero no sooner appeared at the street door  than he  was saluted by the messenger  who having posted himself in the way for  that purpose   God bless your noble honour  Squire Pickle   cried he     6 22 15  3 45 PM    and give you joy of succeeding to your father s estate   These words  had scarce proceeded from his mouth
