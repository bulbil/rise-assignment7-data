 as was said  to attack the French fleet  then supposed to be lying near that place  but before we arrived they had sailed for Europe  having first dispatched an advice boat to Carthagena with an account of our being in these seas  as also of our strength and destination —We loitered here some days longer  taking in wood  and brackish water  in the use whereof  however  our admiral seemed to consult the health of the men  by restricting each to a quart a day —At length we set sail  and arrived in a bay to the windward of Carthagena  where we came to an anchor  and lay at our ease ten days longer —Here again  certain malicious people take occasion to blame the conduct of their superiors  by saying  this was not only throwing away time  which was very precious considering the approach of the rainy season  but also giving the Spaniards time to recollect   281 themselves  and recover from the consternation they were thrown into at the approach of an English fleet  at least three times as numerous as ever appeared in that part of the world before  But if I might be allowed to give my opinion of the matter  I would ascribe this delay to the generosity of our chiefs  who scorned to take any advantage that fortune might give them  even over an enemy  At last  however  we weighed  and anchored again somewhat nearer the harbour s mouth  where we made shift to land our marines  who encamped on the beach  in despite of the enemy s shot  which knocked a good many of them on the head —This piece of conduct in chusing a camp under the walls of an enemy s fortification  which I believe never happened before  was practised  I presume  with a view of accustoming the soldiers to stand fire  who were not as yet much used to discipline  most of them having been taken from the plough tail a few months before —This again has furnished matter for censure against the Ministry  for sending a few raw recruits on such an important enterprize  while so many veteran regiments lay inactive at home  But surely our governours had their reasons for so doing  which possibly may be disclosed with other secrets of the deep  Perhaps they were loth to risk their best troops on such desperate service  or  may be the colonels and field officers of the old corps  who  generally speaking  enjoyed their commissions as sine cures or pensions  for some domestick services tendered to the court  refused to embark in such a dangerous and precarious undertaking  for which  no doubt  they are to be much commended     282  CHAP  XXXII   Our land forces being disembarked  erect a faschine battery—our ship is ordered with four more  to batter the fort of Bocca Chica—Mackshane s cowardice—the chaplain s phrenzy—honest Rattlin lases one hand—his heroism and reflections on the battle—Crampley s behaviour to me during the heat of the fight   OUR forces being landed and stationed as I have already mentioned  set about erecting a faschine battery to cannonade the principal fort of the enemy  and in something more than three weeks  it was ready to open  That we might do the Spaniards as much honour as possible  it was determined in a council of war  that five of our largest ships should attack the fort on one side  while the battery plyed it on the other  strengthened with two mortars  and twenty four cohorns   Accordingly  the signal for our ship to engage  among others  was hoisted  we being advertised the night before  to make every thing clear for that purpose  and in so doing  a difference happened between captain Oakhum and his well beloved cousin and counsellor Mackshane  which had well nigh terminated in an open rupture —The doctor  who had imagined there was no more danger of being hurt by the enemy s shot in the   283 cockpit than in the center of the earth  was lately informed that a surgeon s mate had been killed in that place  by a cannon ball from two small forts  that were destroyed before the disembarkation of our soldiers  and therefore insisted upon having a platform raised for the convenience of the sick and wounded  in the after hold  where he deemed himself more secure than on the deck above —The captain  offended at this extraordinary proposal  accused him of pusilanimity  and told him there was no room in the hold for such an occasion  or if there was  he could not expect to be indulged more than the rest of the surgeons of the navy  who used the cockpit for that purpose  Fear rendering Mackshane obstinate  he persisted in his demand  and shewed his instructions  by which it was authorised  The captain swore these instructions were dictated by a parcel of lazy poltroons who were never at sea  but was obliged to comply  and sent for the carpenter to give him orders about it  But before any such measure could be taken  our signal was thrown out  and the doctor compelled to trust his carcase in the cockpit  where Morgan and I were busy in putting our instruments and dressings in order   Our ship  with the others destined for this service  immediately weighed  and in less than half
