great shock  insomuch that the wheels were locked  and it was not   without some difficulty  and the assistance of several people  who   seeing what had happened  ran out of their shops and houses  that the   coachmen were able to keep their horses from going on  which  had they   done  both the machines must inevitably have been torn to pieces  there   were two gentlemen in the chariot  who immediately jumped out  Miss   Betsy screaming  and frighted almost to death  was also helped out of   the coach by a very civil tradesman  before whose door the accident had   happened  he led her into his shop  and made her sit down  while his   wife ran to fetch a glass of water  and some hartshorn drops       Her extreme terror had hindered her from discovering who was in the   chariot  or whether any one was there  but the gentlemen having crossed   the way  and come into the same shop  she presently knew the one to be   Sir Bazil Loveit  and the other Mr  Trueworth  her surprize at the sight   of the latter was such as might have occasioned some raillery  if it had   not been concealed under that which she had sustained before  Sir Bazil   approached her with a very respectful bow  and made a handsome apology   for the fault his man had committed  in not giving way when a lady was   in the coach  to which she modestly replied  that there could be no   fault where there was no design of offending  Mr  Trueworth then   drawing near  with a very cold and reserved air  told her he hoped she   would receive no prejudice by the accident        I believe the danger is now over   said she  struck to the very heart   at finding herself accosted by him in a manner so widely different from   that to which she had been accustomed  scarce had she the fortitude to   bear the shock it gave her  but  summoning to her aid all that pride and   disdain could supply her with  to prevent him from perceiving how much   she was affected by his behaviour   I could not  however   pursued she    with a tone of voice perfectly ironical   have expected to receive any   consolation under this little disaster from Mr  Trueworth  I imagined    sir  that some weeks ago you had been reposing yourself in the   delightful bowers  and sweet recesses  of your country seat  How often   have I heard you repeat with pleasure these lines of Mr  Addison s             Bear me  ye gods  t Umbraia s gentle seats        Or hide me in sweet Bayia s soft retreats         Yet still I find you in this noisy  bustling town   She concluded these   words with a forced smile  which Mr  Trueworth taking no notice of    replied with the same gravity as before   I purposed  indeed  Madam  to   have returned to Oxfordshire  but events then unforeseen have detained   me        While they were speaking  Sir Bazil recollecting the face of Miss Betsy    which till now he had not done  cried   I think  Madam  I have had the   honour of seeing you before this     Yes  Sir Bazil   replied she    knowing very well he meant at Miss Forward s   you saw me once in a   place where neither you  nor anyone else  will ever see me again  but I   did not then know the character of the person I visited   To which Sir   Bazil only replying  that he believed she did not  Mr  Trueworth   immediately rejoined  that the most cautious might be  once  deceived       The emphasis with which he uttered the word once  made Miss Betsy see   that he bore still in his mind the second error she had been guilty of   in visiting that woman  but she had no time to give any other answer   than a look of scorn and indignation  Sir Bazil s footman telling him   the chariot was now at liberty  and had received no damage  on which the   gentlemen took their leave of her  Mr  Trueworth shewing no more concern   in doing so  than Sir Bazil himself  or any one would have done  who   never had more than a mere cursory acquaintance with her       She would not be persuaded to go into the coach again  much less could   she think of going on her intended visit  but desired a chair to be   called  and went directly home  in order to give vent to those emotions   which
