was concerned  and  entreated Mr  Pickle to be the bearer of a challenge  which he would  instantly commit to writing   The mischievous fomenter highly applauded this manifestation of courage   by which he was at liberty to cultivate his friendship and society   but declined the office of carrying the billet  that his tenderness of  Pallet s reputation might not be misinterpreted into an officious desire  of promoting quarrels  At the same time  he recommended Tom Pipes  not  only as a very proper messenger on this occasion  but also as a trusty  second in the field  The magnanimous painter took his advice  and   retiring to his chamber  penned a challenge in these terms           Sir   When I am heartily provoked  I fear not the devil       himself  much less  I will not call you a pedantic coxcomb        nor an unmannerly fellow  because these are the hippethets of       the vulgar  but  remember  such as you are  I nyther love you       nor fear you  but  on the contrary  expect satisfaction for your       audacious behaviour to me on divers occasions  and will  this       evening  in the twilight  meet you on the ramparts with sword       and pistol  where the Lord have mercy on the soul of one of us        for your body shall find no favour with your incensed defier       till death                                          Layman Pallet    This resolute defiance  after having been submitted to the perusal  and  honoured with the approbation of our youth  was committed to the charge  of Pipes  who  according to his orders  delivered it in the afternoon   and brought for answer  that the physician would attend him at the    6 22 15  3 45 PM   appointed time and place  The challenger was evidently discomposed at  the unexpected news of this acceptance  and ran about the house in  great disorder  in quest of Peregrine  to beg his further advice and  assistance  but understanding that the youth was engaged in private with  his adversary  he began to suspect some collusion  and cursed himself  for his folly and precipitation  He even entertained some thoughts  of retracting his invitation  and submitting to the triumph of his  antagonist  but before he would stoop to this opprobrious condescension   he resolved to try another expedient  which might be the means of saving  both his character and person  In this hope he visited Mr  Jolter  and  very gravely desired he would be so good as to undertake the office  of his second in a duel which he was to fight that evening with the  physician   The governor  instead of answering his expectation  in expressing  fear and concern  and breaking forth into exclamations of  Good God   gentlemen  what d ye mean  You shall not murder one another while it is  in my power to prevent your purpose  I will go directly to the governor  of the place  who shall interpose his authority  I say    instead  of these and other friendly menaces of prevention  Jolter heard the  proposal with the most phlegmatic tranquility  and excused himself from  accepting the honour he intended for him  on account of his character  and situation  which would not permit him to be concerned in any such  rencontres  Indeed  this mortifying reception was owing to a previous  hint from Peregrine  who  dreading some sort of interruption from his  governor  had made him acquainted with his design  and assured him  that  the affair should not be brought to any dangerous issue   Thus disappointed  the dejected challenger was overwhelmed with  perplexity and dismay  and  in the terrors of death or mutilation   resolved to deprecate the wrath of his enemy  and conform to any  submission he should propose  when he was accidentally encountered by  our adventurer  who  with demonstrations of infinite satisfaction  told  him in confidence  that the billet had thrown the doctor into an agony  of consternation  that his acceptance of his challenge was a mere effort  of despair  calculated to confound the ferocity of the sender  and  dispose him to listen to terms of accommodation  that he had imparted  the letter to him with fear and trembling  on pretence of engaging him  as a second  but  in reality  with a view of obtaining his good offices  in promoting a reconciliation   but  perceiving the situation of his  mind   added our hero   I thought it would be more for your honour to  baffle his expectation  and therefore I readily undertook the task of  attending him to the
