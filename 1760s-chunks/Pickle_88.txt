had heard of    6 22 15  3 45 PM   her own husband s death  She even tortured her invention to propagate  calumnies against the reputation of her own daughter  whom she slandered  in all companies  she exclaimed against the commodore as an old  ruffian  who spirited up rebellion among her children  and imputed the  hospitality of his wife  in countenancing them  to nothing else but her  inveterate enmity to their mother  whom they had disobliged  She now  insisted  in the most peremptory terms  upon her husband s renouncing  all commerce with the old lad of the castle and his adherents  and Mr   Gamaliel  having by this time contracted other friendships  readily  submitted to her will  nay  even refused to communicate with the  commodore one night  when they happened to meet by accident at the  public house   CHAPTER XXXII   The Commodore sends a Challenge to Gamaliel  and is imposed upon by a  waggish invention of the Lieutenant  Peregrine  and Gauntlet   This affront Trunnion could by no means digest  he advised with the  lieutenant upon the subject  and the result of their consultation was a  defiance which the old commander sent to Pickle  demanding that he would  meet him at such a place on horseback with a brace of pistols  and give  satisfaction for the slight he had put upon him  Nothing could have  afforded more pleasure to Jack than the acceptance of this challenge   which he delivered verbally to Mr  Gamaliel  who was called out from  the club at Tunley s for that purpose  The nature of this message had an  instantaneous effect upon the constitution of the pacific Pickle  whose  bowels yearned with apprehension  and underwent such violent agitation  on the spot  that one would have thought the operation proceeded from  some severe joke of the apothecary which he had swallowed in his beer   The messenger  despairing of a satisfactory answer  left him in this  woeful condition  and being loath to lose any opportunity of raising the  laugh against the commodore  went immediately and communicated the whole  affair to the young gentlemen  entreating them  for the love of God   to concert some means of bringing old Hannibal into the field  The  two friends relished the proposal  and after some deliberation  it was  resolved that Hatchway should tell Trunnion his invitation was accepted  by Gamaliel  who would meet him at the place appointed  with his second   to morrow in the twilight  because  if either should fall  the other  would have the chance of escaping in the dark  that Godfrey should  personate old Pickle s friend  and Peregrine represent his own father   while the lieutenant should take care in loading the pistols to keep out  the shot  so that no damage might be done in the rencounter   These circumstances being adjusted  the lieutenant returned to his  principal with a most thundering reply from his antagonist  whose  courageous behaviour  though it could not intimidate  did not fail to  astonish the commodore  who ascribed it to the spirit of his wife   which had inspired him  Trunnion that instant desired his counsellor to  prepare his cartridge box  and order the quietest horse in the stable to  be kept ready saddled for the occasion  his eye seemed to lighten with    6 22 15  3 45 PM   alacrity and pleasure at the prospect of smelling gunpowder once more  before his death  and when Jack advised him to make his will  in case of  accident  he rejected his counsel with disdain  saying   What  dost thou  think that Hawser Trunnion  who has stood the fire of so many floating  batteries  runs any risk from the lousy pops of a landman  Thou shalt  see  thou shalt see  how I ll make him lower his topsails    Next day Peregrine and the soldier provided themselves with horses at  the public house  from whence  at the destined hour  they rode to the  field of battle  each of them being muffed in a great coat  which  with  the dimness of the light  effectually shielded them from the knowledge  of the one eyed commander  who  having taken horse  on pretence of  enjoying the fresh air  soon appeared with Hatchway in his rear  When  they came within sight of each other  the seconds advanced  in order to  divide the ground  and regulate the measures of the combat  when it was  determined by mutual consent  that two pistols should be discharged on  each side  and that if neither should prove decisive  recourse must  be had to the broad swords  in order to ascertain the victory  These  articles being settled  the opponents rode forward to their respective  stations  when Peregrine  cocking his pistol  and presenting   counterfeited his father s voice  bidding Trunnion take care of his  remaining eye   The commodore took his advice  being unwilling to hazard his daylight   and very deliberately opposed the patched side of his face to the muzzle  of his antagonist s
