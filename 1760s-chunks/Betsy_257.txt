joy amidst this little company  Mr  Munden expressed  and indeed    felt  an infinity of transport  on having triumphed over so many   difficulties  which had for a long time continually risen to impede his   wishes  The two Mr  Thoughtlesses were extremely overjoyed  on thinking   a period was put to all their cares in relation to their sister  Lady   Trusty also  and Sir Ralph  looking on this marriage  as things were   circumstanced  highly convenient for Miss Betsy  were very much pleased    so that it must necessarily follow  that an event  which cost so much   pains to bring about  must occasion a general content in the minds of   all those who had so strenuously laboured for it       Amidst this scene of joy  Miss Betsy herself was the only person whose   countenance discovered the least pensiveness  nor was hers any more than   what might be attributed to the modesty of a virgin bride       Lady Trusty  however  who had observed her all day with an attentive   eye  thought it proper to give her some admonitions concerning her   future behaviour  before she took her leave       To this end  she drew her into another room  apart from the company  and   having told her she had something of moment to say to her  began to   entertain her in the following manner        My dear child   said she   you are now  I fear  more through your   compliance with the desires of your friends than through your own   inclination  entered into a state  the happiness of which greatly   depends on the part you act in the first scenes of it  there are some   women who think they can never testify too much fondness for their   husbands  and that the name of wife is a sufficient sanction for giving   a loose to the utmost excesses of an extravagant and romantick passion    but this is a weakness which I am pretty certain you will stand in no   need of my advice to guard against  I am rather apprehensive of your   running into a contrary extreme  equally dangerous to your future peace    as to that of your husband  A constant and unmoved insensibility will in   time chill the most warm affection  and  perhaps  raise suspicions in   him of the cause  which would be terrible indeed  beware  therefore  I   conjure you  how you affect to despise  or treat with any marks of   contempt  or even of too much coldness  a tenderness which he has a   right to expect you should return in kind  as far  at least  as modesty   and discretion will permit you to bestow        As to your conduct in family affairs   continued this good lady   I   would have you always confine yourself to such things as properly   appertain to your own province  never interfering with such as belong to   your husband  be careful to give to him all the rights of his place    and  at the same time  maintain your own  though without seeming to be   too tenacious of them  If any dispute happen to arise between you   concerning superiority  though in matters of the slightest moment    rather recede a little from your due than contend too far  but let him   see you yield more to oblige him than because you think yourself bound   to do so        Mr  Munden  I flatter myself  has every qualification to make you   happy  and to shew that your friends  in advising you to marry him  have   not misled your choice  but as perfection is not to be found on this   side the grave  and the very best of us are not exempt from the   frailties of human nature  whatever errors he may happen to fall into    as it does not become you to reprimand him  I wish you would never take   notice you have observed them  A man of the strictest honour and good   sense may sometimes slip  be guilty of some slight forgetfulness  but   then he will recover of himself  and be ashamed of his mistake  whereas   reproaches only serve to harden the indignant mind  and make it rather   chuse to persevere in the vices it detests  than to return to the   virtues it admires  if warned by the remonstrances of another        But  above all things   added she   I would wish you to consider that   those too great gaieties of life you have hitherto indulged  which    however  innocent  could not escape censure while in a single state    will now have a much worse aspect in a married one        Mistake me not  my
