he   that to every act of   this immaterial and immortal part  the Father of spirits  from whom it   proceeds  is present  when I behold the busy multitudes that crowd the   metropolis of Persia  in the persuit of business and projects infinitely   complicated and various  and consider that every idea which passes over   their minds  every conclusion  and every purpose  with all that they   remember of the past  and all that they imagine of the future  is at   once known to the Almighty  who without labour or confusion weighs every   thought of every mind in His balance  and reserves it to the day of   retribution  my follies cover me with confusion  and my soul is humbled   in the dust        ALMORAN  though he appeared to listen with attention  and offered   nothing against the reasoning of OMAR  yet secretly despised it as   sophistry  which cunning only had rendered specious  and which he was   unable to confute  merely because it was subtil  and not because it was   true  he had been led  by his passions  first to love  and then to adopt   different opinions  and as every man is inclined to judge of others by   himself  he doubted  whether the principles which OMAR had thus laboured   to establish  were believed even by OMAR himself       Thus was the mind of ALMORAN to the instructions of OMAR  as a rock   slightly covered with earth  is to the waters of heaven  the craggs are   left bare by the rain that washes them  and the same showers that   fertilize the field can only discover the sterility of the rock       OMAR  however  did not yet disclose his suspicions to HAMET  because he   did not yet see that it could answer any purpose  To remove ALMEIDA from   her apartment  would be to shew a distrust  for which there would not   appear to be any cause  and to refuse ALMORAN access to her when he   desired it  might precipitate such measures as he might meditate  and   engage him in some desperate attempt  he  therefore  contented himself   with advising HAMET  to conceal the time of his marriage till the   evening before he intended it should take place  without assigning the   reason on which his advice was founded       To the council of OMAR  HAMET was implicitly obedient  as to the   revelations of the Prophet  but  like his instructions  it was neglected   by ALMORAN  who became every moment more wretched  He had a graceful   person  and a vigorous mind  he was in the bloom of youth  and had a   constitution that promised him length of days  he had power which   princes were emulous to obey  and wealth by which whatever could   administer to luxury might be bought  for every passion  and every   appetite  it was easy for him to procure a perpetual succession of new   objects  yet was ALMORAN  not only without enjoyment  but without peace    he was by turns pining with discontent  and raving with indignation  his   vices had extracted bitter from every sweet  and having exhausted   nature for delight in vain  he was repining at the bounds in which he   was confined  and regretting the want of other powers as the cause of   his misery       Thus the year of mourning for Solyman was compleated  without any act of   violence on the part of ALMORAN  or of caution on the part of HAMET  but   on the evening of the last day  HAMET  having secretly prepared every   thing for performing the solemnity in a private manner  acquainted   ALMORAN by a letter  which OMAR  undertook to deliver  that he should   celebrate his marriage on the morrow  ALMORAN  who never doubted but he   should have notice of this event much longer before it was to happen    read the letter with a perturbation that it was impossible to conceal    he was alone in his private apartment  and taking his eye hastily from   the paper  he crushed it together in his hand  and thrusting it into his   bosom  turned from OMAR without speaking  and OMAR  thinking himself   dismissed  withdrew       The passions which ALMORAN could no longer suppress  now burst out  in a   torrent of exclamation   Am I then  said he   blasted for ever with a   double curse  divided empire and disappointed love  What is dominion  if   it is not possessed alone  and what is power  which the dread of rival   power perpetually controuls  Is it for me to listen in silence to the   wrangling of slaves  that I may at last apportion to them what  with a
