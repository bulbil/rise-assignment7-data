former war  and now occupied at a very great expence  as a place of the utmost importance    84 to the commerce of the empire  Repeated advices of the enemy s design were sent from different parts  to the m—y of Japan  but they seemed all overwhelmed by such a lethargy of infatuation  that no measures of prevention were concerted   Such was the opinion of the people  but the truth is  they were fast asleep  The Japonese hold with the antient Greeks and modern Americans  that dreams are from heaven  and in any perplexing emergency  they  like the Indians  Jews  and natives of Madagascar  have recourse to dreaming as to an oracle  These dreams or divinations are preceded by certain religious rites analagous to the ceremony of the ephod  the urim and the thummim  The rites were religiously performed in the council of Twenty Eight  and a deep sleep overpowered the Dairo and all his counsellors      85 Got hama baba the emperor  who reposed his head upon the pillowy sides of Quamba cun dono  dreamed that he was sacrificing in the temple of Fakkubasi  and saw the deity of the White Horse devouring pearls by the bushel at one end  and voiding corruption by the ton at the other  The Fatzman dreamed that a great number of Chinese cooks were busy buttering his brains  Gotto mio dreamed of lending money and borrowing sense  Sti phi rum poo thought he had procured a new law for clapping padlocks upon the chastity of all the females in Japan under twenty  of which padlocks he himself kept the keys  Nin kom poo po dreamed he was metamorphosed into a sea lion  in pursuit of a shoal of golden gudgeons  One did laugh in s sleep  and one cried murder  The first was Soo san sin o  who had precisely the same vision that disturbed the imagination of the Cuboy     86 He thought he saw the face of a right reverend prelate of the Bonzas  united with and growing to the posteriors of the minister  Fika kaka underwent the same disagreeable illusion  with this aggravating circumstance  that he already felt the teeth of the said Bonza  The president laughed aloud at the ridiculous phaenomenon  the Cuboy exclaimed in the terror of being encumbered with such a monstrous appendage  It was not without some reason he cried     Murder    Foksi roku  who happened to sleep on the next chair  dreamed of money bags  places  and reversions  and in the transport of his eagerness  laid fast hold on the trunk breeches of the Cuboy  including certain fundamentals  which he grasped so violently as to excite pain  and extort the exclamation from Fika kaka  even in his sleep     The council being at last waked    78 by the clamours of the people  who surrounded the palace  and proclaimed that Motao was in danger of an invasion  the sea Sey seo gun Nin kom poo po  was ordered to fit out a fleet of Fune for the relief of that island  and directions were given that the commander of these Fune should  in his voyage  touch at the garrison of Foutao  and take on board from thence a certain number of troops  to reinforce the Japonese governor of the place that was in danger  Nin kom poo po for this service chose the commander Bihn goh  a man who had never signalized himself by any act of valour  He sent him out with a squadron of Fune ill manned  wretchedly provided  and inferior in number to the fleet of China  which was by this time known to be assembled in order to support the invasion of the island of Motao  He sailed  nevertheless  on this expedition  and touched at the garrison of Foutao to    88 take in the reinforcement  but the orders sent for this purpose from Nob o di  minister for the department of war  appeared so contradictory and absurd  that they could not possibly be obeyed  so that Bihngoh proceeded without the reinforcement towards Motao  the principal fortress of which was by this time invested  He had been accidentally joined by a few cruisers  which rendered him equal in strength to the Chinese squadron which he now descried  Both commanders seemed afraid of each other  The fleets  however  engaged  but little damage was done to either  They parted as if by consent  Bihn goh made the best of his way back to Foutao  without making the least attempt to succour  or open a communication with Fi de ta da  the governor of Motao  who  looking upon himself as abandoned by his country  surrendered his fortress     89 with the whole island  to the Chinese general  These disgraces happening on the back of the Fatsissian disasters  raised a prodigious ferment in Japan  and the ministry had almost sunk under the first fury of the people s resentment  They not only exclaimed against the folly of the administration  but they also accused them of treachery  and seemed to think that the glory and advantage of the empire had been betrayed  What increased the commotion was the terror of an invasion  with which the Chinese threatened the islands of Japan  The terrors of Fika ka had already cost him two pair of trunk
