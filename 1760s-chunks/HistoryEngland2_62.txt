which the principal strength of the kingdom lay  induced the new ministry to divert the attention of the public to a war  which might be carried on by land  The King s attachment to his Electoral dominions contributed still more to turn the current of British indignation that way  and an army was therefore now prepared to be sent into Flanders  the war with Spain being become an object of secondary consideration   To have a clear  yet concise  idea of the origin of the troubles on the continent  it will be expedient to go back  for some years  and trace the measures of the European republic to that period where we formerly left them  After the Duke of Orleans  who had been regent of France  died  Cardinal Fleury undertook to settle that confusion in which the former had left the kingdom  His moderation was equal to his prudence  he was sincere  frugal  modest  and simple  Under him France repaired her losses  and inriched herself by commerce  he only left the state to its own natural methods of thriving  and saw it daily assuming its former health and vigour  During the long interval of peace  which his councils had procured for Europe  two powers  unregarded  now   167 began to attract the notice  and the jealousy of their neighbouring states  Peter the Great had already civilized Russia  and this new extensive empire began to influence the councils of other Princes  and to give laws to the North  The other power was that of Prussia  whose dominions were compact and populous  and whose forces were well maintained  and ready for action  The Empire continued under Charles VI  who had been placed upon the throne by the treaty of Utrecht  Sweden languished  being not yet recovered from the destructive projects of Charles XII  Denmark was powerful  and part of Italy subject to the masters which had been imposed upon it by foreign treaties  All  however  continued to enjoy a profound peace  till the death of Augustus  King of Poland  again kindled up the general flame  The Emperor Charles VI  assisted by the arms of Russia  declared for the Elector of Saxony  son to the deceased King  On the other hand  France declared for Stanislaus  who had been long since elected King of Poland by Charles XII  and whose daughter had been since married to the French King  Stanislaus repaired to Dantzick in order to support his election  ten thousand Russians appearing  the Polish nobility dispersed  and their new elected Monarch was shut up  and besieged by so small a number of forces  the city was taken  and the King scaped with the utmost difficulty  being made a prioner  and fifteen hundred Frenchmen that were sent o his assistance were made prisoners of war  He ad now no hopes left but in the assistance of France  which accordingly resolved to give him powerful sucours  by distressing the house of Austria  The views f France were seconded by Spain and Sardinia  oth hoped to grow more powerful by a division of he spoils of Austria  and France had motives of …liance and revenge  A French army therefore soon ver ran the empire under the conduct of old Marshal   168 Villars  the Duke of Montemar  the Spanish general  was equally victorious in the kingdom of Naples  and the Emperor  Charles VI  had the mortification of seeing himself deprived of the greatest part of Italy  for having attempted to give a King to Poland  These rapid successes of France and its allies soon compelled the Emperor to demand a peace  By this treaty Stanislaus  upon whose account the war was undertaken  was obliged to renounce all right to the throne of Poland  and France made some valuable acquests of dominion  particularly the Duchy of Lorrain  In the year 1740  the death of the Emperor gave the French another opportunity of exerting their ambition  Regardless of treaties  particularly the pragmatic sanction  as it was called  which settled upon the daughter of the Emperor the reversion of all his dominions  they caused the Elector of Bavaria to be crowned Emperor  Thus the daughter of Charles VI  descended from an illustrious line of Emperors  saw herself stripped of her inheritance  and  for an whole year  without hopes of succour  She had scarce closed her father s eyes  when she lost Silesia  by an irruption of the young King of Prussia  who seized the opportunity of her defenceless state  to renew his ancient pretensions to that province of which it must be owned his ancestors had been unjustly deprived  France  Saxony  and Bavaria  attacked the rest of her dominions  In this forlorn situation she found a powerful ally in Britain  Sardinia and Holland soon after came to her assistance  and  last of all  Russia joined in her cause  It may be demanded  What part Britain had in these continental measures  The interests of Hanover  the security and aggrandizement of that Electorate  depended upon the proper regulation of the empire  Lord Carteret had now taken that place in the royal confidence which had formerly been possessed by Walpole  and  by pursuing these measures   169 he soothed the wishes of his master  and opened a more extensive field for his own ambition  He expected honour from victories
