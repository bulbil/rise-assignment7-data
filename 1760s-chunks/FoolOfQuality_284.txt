  pray  what do   you think of the entertainment they afford      As of the dullest of all dull farces  answered the knight  All the   courts that I have seen are nearly of the same cast  Conceive to   yourself  sir  a stage or theatre of comedians without auditors or   spectators  They are all actors  and all act nearly the same part   of solemn complaisance and nauseous grimace  Each intends to   impose  and yet no one is imposed upon   where professions are   taken to imply the very reverse of what they express      What do you say to this  Harry  said Mr  Fenton  I have very   little to say  sir  in favour of the actors   but the actresses  as I   take it  afford better entertainment  Here Sir William and Mr    Fenton laughed   and Harry  upon a wink  stepped out to bring in   Homely  as it were by accident      Sir William  said Mr  Fenton  there is a man come to this house   who once saved my life at the risk of his own  It is a great many   years ago  and I have not seen him since the action till very lately    I have sent Harry for him  that you may learn the particulars  and   advise with me what recompense he ought to receive      If the recompense is to be proportioned to the value of the life   he saved  my honoured sir  I should not know where to fix the   bounds of retribution  And in truth  Mr  Fenton  from my   knowledge of you this day  I also hold myself very highly his   debtor      At this instant Harry led in Homely by the hand  and left him   standing directly opposite to the baronet      Homely gazed with all his eyes  and stood mute through astonish    ment  At length he exclaimed Bless me   mercy upon me as   sure as I hope for heaven it is I think it is my dear young   master           THE FOOL OF QUALITY  307     Sir William  at the voice  lifted up his eyes to Homely  and    remembering his marked man  rose quickly  and springing forward    embraced him with much familiar affection   while Mr  Fenton sat    and his Harry stood beside him  both wrapped in their own   delicious sensibilities      My dear Homely  my old companion and brother sportsman    cried Sir William  how in the world comes this about   so joyfully    so unexpectedly  to meet you here   How is your wife and pretty   babes  I hope you left  all well at home      Yes  please your honour  they are all well wonderfully well in   this house  I assure you   for  indeed  your Homely has no other   home upon earth      What you tell me is quite astonishing  replied the knight   no   home for you within the manor or demesne of your friend    What misfortunes  what revolutions  could bring this wonder to         Sit down  said Mr  Fenton  pray be seated  Mr  Homely  and   give your lord a succinct but deliberate account of the inimitable   pair  Sir Freestone and his coadjutor      As soon as Homely had told his tale  from the commencement of   his distresses to his arrival at the hovel  he stopped short  and   said I have something more to impart   but I hope your honour   will pardon me  I am loth to deprive your friends of your   company   but then my Peggy and my boys will be so transported   to see your dear face again  that I cannot but beseech you to   indulge them  a minute or two  with that blessing      Sir William rose with a troubled humanity in his countenance    and followed to a back apartment  where Homely again stopped   him short   and  before he would take him to his Peggy  he gave   him a minute detail of all his obligations to what he called this   wonderful family  But pray  sir  continued he  let them know very   little of what I have told you   for nothing puts them to so much   pain as any kind of acknowledgments      After a short visit to Peggy and her children  Sir William   returned to his friends  with such an inward awe and veneration for   their characters  as for a while sunk his spirits  and solemnized his   features  This poor man  sir
