home  So that  finding his person in danger at London  he had been  obliged to escape into the country  skulking about from one village to  another  till  being quite destitute of all support  he had undertaken  his present office  to save himself from starving   Peregrine listened with compassion to his lamentable tale  which too  well accounted for his not appearing in the Fleet  with offers of  service to his master in distress  a circumstance that Pickle had all  along imputed to his avarice and ingratitude  He assured him  that  as  he had been the means of throwing in his way the temptation to which  he fell a sacrifice  he would charge himself with the retrieval of his  affairs  In the meantime  he made him taste of his bounty  and desired  him to continue in his present employment until he should return from  the garrison  when he would consider his situation  and do something for  his immediate relief   Hadgi attempted to kiss his shoe  and wept  or affected to weep  with  sensibility at this gracious reception  he even made a merit of his  unwillingness to exercise his new occupation  and earnestly begged that  he might be allowed to give immediate attendance upon his dear master   from whom he could not bear the thoughts of a second parting  His  entreaties were reinforced by the intercession of his two friends  in  consequence of which the Swiss was permitted to follow them at his own  leisure  while they set forward after a slight repast  and reached the  place of their destination before ten o clock at night   Peregrine  instead of alighting at the garrison  rode straightway to  his father s house  and no person appearing to receive him  not even a  servant to take care of his chaise  he dismounted without assistance   Being followed by his two friends  he advanced into the hall  where  perceiving a bell rope  he made immediate application to it in such a  manner as brought a couple of footmen into his presence  After having    6 22 15  3 45 PM   reprimanded them  with a stern look  for their neglect in point of  attendance  he commanded them to show him into an apartment  and as they  seemed unwilling to yield obedience to his orders  asked if they did not  belong to the family   One of them  who took upon himself the office of spokesman  replied with  a sullen air  that they had been in the service of old Mr  Pickle  and  now that he was dead  thought themselves bound to obey nobody but their  lady  and her son Mr  Gamaliel  This declaration had scarce proceeded  from his mouth  when our hero gave them to understand  that since  they were not disposed to own any other master  they must change  their quarters immediately  He ordered them to decamp without further  preparation  and  as they still continued restive  they were kicked  out of doors by the captain and his friend Hatchway  Squire Gam  who  overheard everything that passed  and was now more than ever inflamed  with that rancour which he had sucked with his mother s milk  flew to  the assistance of his adherents  with a pistol in each hand  bellowing   Thieves  Thieves   with great vociferation  as if he had mistaken the  business of the strangers  and actually believed himself in danger of  being robbed  Under this pretence he discharged a piece at his brother   who luckily escaped the shot  closed with him in a moment  and  wresting  the other pistol from his grip  turned him out into the courtyard  to  the consolation of his two dependents   By this time  Pipes and the two postilions had taken possession of  the stables  without being opposed by the coachman and his deputy  who  quietly submitted to the authority of their new sovereign  But the noise  of the pistol had alarmed Mrs  Pickle  who  running downstairs  with the  most frantic appearance  attended by two maids and the curate  who still  maintained his place of chaplain and ghostly director in the family   would have assaulted our hero with her nails  had not she been  restrained by her attendants  Though they prevented her from using her  hands  they could not hinder her from exercising her tongue  which she  wagged against him with all the virulence of malice  She asked  if he  were come to butcher his brother  to insult his father s corpse   and triumph in her affliction  She bestowed upon him the epithets of  spendthrift  jail bird  and unnatural ruffian  she begged pardon of God  for having brought such a monster into the world  accused him of having  brought his father s grey hairs with sorrow to the grave  and affirmed   that were he to touch the body  it would bleed at his approach   Without pretending to refute the articles of this ridiculous charge  he  allowed her to ring out her alarm  and then calmly replied  that
