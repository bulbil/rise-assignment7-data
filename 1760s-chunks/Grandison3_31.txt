 if you will rid me of this plague   Well  then  my Lord  you will leave it to me to do the best I can with her  But it cannot be the best on your side  for your honour s sake  if we do her not that justice that the law would  or ought to do her  In a word  my Lord  you must forgive me for saying  that you shall not resume that dignity to distress this woman  which you laid aside when you entered into treaty with her   Well  well  I refer myself to your management  Only this 100l  a year—Once again  I say  it would hurt me to reward a woman for plaguing me  And 150l  a year is two thirds more than ever she  or any of her family  were intitled to   The worst and meanest are intitled to justice  my Lord  and I hope your Lordship will not refuse to perform engagements that you entered into with your eyes open  You must not  if I take any concern in this affair   Just then the woman sent in  to beg the favour of an audience  as she called it  of me   She addressed me in terms above her education  There is something  said she  in your countenance  Sir  so terrible  and yet so sweet  that one must fear your anger  and yet hope for your forgiveness  when one has offended  I was too free in speaking of my Lord to his nephew—And then she made a compliment to my character  and told me  She would be determined by my pleasure  be it what it would   How seldom are violent spirits true spirits  When over awed  how tame are they  generally  in their   76 submission  Yet this woman was not without art in hers  She saw  that  displeased as she apprehended I was with her  I had given her hopes of the payment of the hundred pounds a year penalty  and this made her so acquiescent   I was indeed displeased with you  Mrs  Giffard  and could not  from what you said  but conclude in your disfavour  in justification of my Lord s complaints against you   Will you give me leave  Sir  to lay before you the true state of every thing between my Lord and me  Indeed  Sir  you don t know—  When two persons  who have lived in familiarity  differ  the fault is seldom wholly on one side  But thus far I judge between you  and desire not to hear particulars  The man who dispenses with a known duty  in such a case as this before us  must render himself despicable in the eyes of the very person whom he raises into consequence by sinking his own  Chastity is the crown and glory of a woman  The most profligate of men love modesty in the sex  at the very time they are forming plots to destroy it in a particular object  When a woman has submitted to put a price upon her honour  she must appear  at times  despicable in the eyes even of her seducer  and when these two break out into animosity  ought either to wish to live with the other   Indeed  indeed  Sir  I am struck with remorse  I see my error  And she put her handkerchief to her eyes  and seemed to weep   I proceeded  You  Mrs  Giffard  doubted the continuance of my Lord s passion  You made your terms  therefore  and proposed a penalty besides  My Lord submitted to the terms  and by that means secured his right of dismissing you  at his pleasure  the only conveniency  that a man dishonouring himself by despising marriage  can think he has  Between him and you  what remains to be said  tho  you are both   77 answerable at a tribunal higher than your own  but that you should have separated long ago  Yet you would not consent to it  You would not leave him at liberty to assert the right he had reserved to himself  Strange weakness in him  that he would suffer that to depend upon you  But one weakness is the parent of another   She then visibly wept   You found it out  that you could torment your Lord in an higher degree  than he could torment you  and how  acting upon such principles  you have lived together for some time past  you have let every one see   She  on her knees  besought my pardon for the freedom of that expression  not from motives of contrition  as I apprehend  but from those of policy   She was strong enough to raise herself  without my assistance  She did  unbidden  on seeing me step backward a pace or two  to give her an opportunity to do so  and looked very silly  and the more  for having missed my assisting hand  By which I supposed  that she had usually better success with my Lord  whenever she had prevailed on herself to kneel to him   It is easy  my good Dr  Bartlett  from small crevices  to discover day in an
