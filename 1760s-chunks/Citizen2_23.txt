such hands should the administration of justice be entrusted  but to those who know how to reward as well as to punish  it was a fine saying of Nangfu the emperor  who being told that his enemies had raised an insurrection in one of the distant provinces  Come then  my friends  said he  follow me  and I promise you that we shall quickly destroy them  he marched forward  and the rebels submitted upon his approach  All now thought that he would take the most signal revenge  but were surprized to see the captives   67 treated with mildness and humanity  How  cries his first minister  is this the manner in which you fulfil your promise  your royal word was given that your enemies should be destroyed  and behold you have pardoned all  and even caressed some  I promised  replied the emperor  with a generous air  to destroy my enemies  I have fulfilled my word  for see they are enemies no longer  I have made friends of them   This  could it always succeed  were the true method of destroying the enemies of a state  well it were if rewards and mercy alone could regulate the common wealth  but since punishments are sometimes necessary  let them at least be rendered terrible  by being executed but seldom  and let justice lift her sword rather to terrify than revenge   Adieu   LETTER LXXVIII  From the same   I HAVE as yet given you but a short and imperfect description of the Ladies of England  Woman  my friend  is a subject not easily understood  even in China  what therefore can be expected from my knowledge of the sex in a country where they are universally allowed to be riddles  and I but a stranger   To confess a truth  I was afraid to begin the description  lest the sex should undergo some new revolution before it was finished  and my picture   68 should thus become old before it could well be said to have ever been new  To day they are lifted upon stilts  to morrow they lower their heels and raise their heads  their cloaths at one time are bloated out with whalebone  at present they have laid their hoops aside and are become as slim as mermaids  All  all is in a state of continual fluctuation  from the Mandarine s wife  who rattles through the streets in her chariot  to the humble sempstress  who clatters over the pavement in iron shod pattens   What chiefly distinguishes the sex at present is the train  As a Lady s quality or fashion was once determined here by the circumference of her hoop  both are now measured by the length of her tail  Women of moderate fortunes are contented with tails moderately long  but ladies of true taste and distinction set no bounds to their ambition in this particular  I am told the Lady Mayoress  on days of ceremony  carries one longer than a bell wether of Bantam  whose tail you know is trundled along in a wheel barrow   Sun of China  what contradictions do we find in this strange world  not only the people of different countries think in opposition to each other  but the inhabitants of a single island are often found inconsistent with themselves  would you believe it  this very people  my Fum  who are so fond of seeing their women with long tails  at the same time dock their horses to the very rump     But you may easily guess that I am no way displeased with a fashion which tends to encrease a demand for the commodities of the East  and is so   69 very beneficial to the country in which I was born  Nothing can be better calculated to encrease the price of silk than the present manner of dressing  A lady s train is not bought but at some expence  and after it has swept the public walks for a very few evenings  is fit to be worn no longer  more silk must be bought in order to repair the breach  and some ladies of peculiar oeconomy are thus found to patch up their tails eight or ten times in a season  This unnecessary consumption may introduce poverty here  but then we shall be the richer for it in China   The man in black  who is a professed enemy to this manner of ornamenting the tail  assures me  there are numberless inconveniencies attending it  and that a lady dressed up to the fashion is as much a cripple as any in Nankin  But his chief indignation is levelled at those who dress in this manner  without a proper fortune to support it  He assures me  that he has known some  who would have a tail  though they wanted a petticoat  and others  who  without any other pretensions  fancied they became ladies merely from the addition of three superfluous yards of ragged silk  I know a thrifty good woman  continues he  who thinking herself obliged to carry a train like her betters  never walks from home without the uneasy apprehensions of wearing it out too soon  every excursion she makes gives her new anxiety  and her train is every bit as importunate  and wounds her peace as much as the bladder we sometimes see tied to the tail of a cat   Nay
