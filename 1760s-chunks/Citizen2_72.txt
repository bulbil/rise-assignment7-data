acknowledged as Duke of Brentford  Lunenburg  or Lincoln  the observer revolts at this mixture of important and paltry claims  and forgets the Emperor in his familiarity with the Duke or the Deputy   I remember a similar instance of this inverted ambition  in the illustrious King of Manacabo  upon his first treaty with the Portuguese  Among the presents that were made him by the ambassador of that nation  was a sword  with a brass hilt  which he seemed to set a peculiar value upon  This he thought too great an acquisition to his glory  to be forgotten among the number of his titles  He therefore gave orders  that his subjects should style him for the future  Talipot  the immortal Potentate of Manacabo  Messenger of Morning  Enlightener of the Sun  Possessor of the the whole Earth  and mighty Monarch of the Brass handled Sword   This method of mixing majestic and paltry titles  of quartering the arms of a great Empire  and an obscure province  upon the same medal here  had its rise in the virtuous partiality of their late Monarchs  Willing to testify an affection to their native country  they gave its name and ensigns a   225 place upon their coins  and thus in some measure enobled its obscurity  It was indeed but just  that a people which had given England up their King  should receive some honorary equivalent in return  but at present these motives are no more  England has now a Monarch wholly British  and it has some reason to hope for British titles upon British coins   However  were the money of England designed to circulate in Germany  there would be no flagrant impropriety in impressing it with German names and arms  but though this might have been so upon former occasions  I am told there is no danger of it for the future  as England therefore designs to keep back its gold  I candidly think Lunenburg  Oldenburgh  and the rest of them  may very well keep back their titles   It is a mistaken prejudice in Princes  to think that a number of loud sounding names can give new claims to respect  The truly great have ever disdained them  When Timur the Lame had conquered Asia  an orator by profession came to compliment him upon the occasion  He began his harrangue  by styling him the most omnipotent  and the most glorious object of the creation  the Emperor seemed displeased with his paltry adulation  yet still he went on  complimenting him  as the most mighty  the most valiant  and the most perfect of beings  Hold there  my friend  cries the lame Emperor  hold there  till I have got another leg  In fact  the feeble or the despotic alone find pleasure in multiplying these ants of vanity  but strength and freedom have nobler aims    226 and often find the finest adulation in majestic simplicity   The young Monarch of this country has already testified a proper contempt for several unmeaning appendages on royalty  cooks and scullions have been obliged to quit their fires  gentlemens gentlemen  and the whole tribe of necessary people  who did nothing  have been dismissed from further services  A youth  who can thus bring back simplicity and frugality to a court  will soon probably have a true respect for his own glory  and while he has dismissed all useless employments  may disdain to accept of empty or degrading titles  Adieu   LETTER CXVII  From the same   WHENEVER I attempt to characterize the English in general  some unforeseen difficulties constantly occur to disconcert my design  I hesitate between censure and praise  when I consider them as a reasoning philosophical people  they have my applause  but when I reverse the medal  and observe their inconstancy and irresolution  I can scarcely persuade my self that I am observing the same people   Yet upon examination this very inconstancy  so remarkable here  flows from no other source than   227 their love of reasoning  The man who examines a complicated subject on every side  and calls in reason to his assistance  will frequently change  will find himself distracted by opposing probabilities and contending proofs  every alteration of place will diversify the prospect  will give some latent argument new force  aad contribute to maintain an anarchy in the mind   On the contrary  they who never examine with their own reason  act with more simplicity  Ignonance is positive  instinct perseveres  and the human being moves in safety within the narrow circle of brutal uniformity  What is true with regard to individuals  is not less so when applied to states A reasoning government like this  is in continual fluctuation  while those kingdoms where men are taught not to controvert but obey  continue always the same  In Asia  for instance  where the monarch s authority is supported by force  and acknowledged through fear  a change of government is entirely unknown  All the inhabitants seem to wear the same mental complection  and remain contented with hereditary oppression  The sovereign s pleasure is the ultimate rule of duty  every branch of the administration is a perfect epitome of the whole  and if one tyrant is deposed  another starts up in his room to govern as his predecessor  The English  on the contrary  instead of being led
