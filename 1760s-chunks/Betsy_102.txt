 desired she should   do  but she locked them carefully in her cabinet  resolving to consider   the purport of them more seriously before she returned any answer                CHAPTER V       Serves as a supplement to the former          The next morning Miss Flora opened her lips almost as soon as she did   her eyes  to talk to Miss Betsy on the design that had been agreed upon   between them the day before  in relation to Mr  Staple  She told her she   had employed her whole thoughts about it ever since  and that she had   found out a way of introducing the discourse so as to give him no   suspicion that she came from her  yet  at the same time  take away all   his apprehensions of her being in love with Mr  Trueworth  and added    that she would go to his lodgings immediately after breakfast        Indeed   replied Miss Betsy  sullenly   you shall do no such thing  I   do not care what his apprehensions are  or any one else s  The men may   all think and do as they will  I shall not fill my mind with any stuff   about them     Hey day   cried Miss Flora  a good deal shocked at this   sudden turn   what whim has got possession of you now     The whim you   endeavoured to possess me with   said Miss Betsy  scornfully   would   have been a very ridiculous one  I am sure  but I have considered better   on it  and despise such foolish fancies     Good lack   returned the   other   you are grown wonderous wise  methinks  at least  imagine   yourself so  but I shall go to Mr  Staple for all this  I cannot bear   that he should think you are in love with Mr  Trueworth     I know no   business   said Miss Betsy  in a haughty tone   you have either with my   love or hate  and I desire  for the future  you will forbear troubling   your head in my affairs        Miss Flora then told her  that what she had offered was merely in regard   to her reputation  and than ran over again all the arguments she had   urged  in order to prevail on her to come into the measures she   proposed  but whatever she said  either in the wheedling or   remonstrating accent  was equally ineffectual  the other remained firm   in her resolution  and behaved in a manner so different from what Miss   Flora had ever seen her do before  that she knew not what to think of   it  Having her own reasons  however  to bring her  if possible  to a   less grave way of thinking  she omitted nothing in the power of   artifice  that she imagined might be conducive to that end  All the time   they were rising  all the time they were dressing  did she continue to   labour on this score  without being able to obtain any other answers to   what she said  than such as were peremptorily in the negative       It is certain  that Miss Betsy was of so soft and tractable a   disposition  that half the arguments Miss Flora had alledged  would  at   another time  have won her to consent to things of much greater   consequence than this appeared to be  but the discovery she had the day   before made of her deceit  and the little good will she had towards her    gave her sufficient reason to apprehend  that she had some farther   designs than she pretended in this project  though of what nature it   could be was not in her power to conceive  The thing in dispute seemed   to her extremely trifling in itself  but the eagerness with which she   was pressed to it by a person  of whose treachery she had so flagrant a   proof  convinced her  that she ought not  on any account  to acquiesce       Miss Flora  on the other hand  was disconcerted  beyond measure  at this   unexpected change in Miss Betsy s humour  of which she was as little   able to divine the cause  as the other was to guess the design she had   formed  but  determining to accomplish her point  if possible  at any   rate  she endeavoured all she could to dissemble her chagrin  and still   affected a mighty regard for the honour of Miss Betsy  telling her she   was resolved to serve her  whether she would or not  and that  how much   soever she disapproved it  she should pursue her first intention
