 The fruits of his sagacity soon appeared  The new general Abra moria  having reconnoitred a post of the enemy  which was found    213 too strong to be forced  attacked it without hesitation  and his troops were repulsed and routed with considerable slaughter  It was lucky for Taycho that the tidings of this disaster were qualified by the news of two other advantages which the arms of Japan had gained —A separate corps of troops  under Yaf frai and Ya loff  reduced a strong Chinese fortress in the neighbourhood of Fatsisio  and a body of Japonese  headed by a factor called Ka liff  obtained a considerable victory at Fla sao  in the farther extremity of Tartary  where a trading company of Meaco possessed a commercial settlement  The Hydra of Meaco began to shake its numerous heads and growl  when it heard of Abramoria s defeat  At that instant  one of its leaders exclaimed     Bless thy long ears  It was not Taycho that recommended Abra moria to this    214 command  He was appointed by the Fatz man    This was true  It was likewise true  that Taycho had allowed him quietly to succeed to the command  without knowing any thing of his abilities —it was equally true  that Taycho was an utter stranger to Yaf frai and Ya loff  who took the fortress  as well as to the factor Ka liff  who obtained the victory at the farther end of Tartary —Nevertheless  the beast cried aloud   Hang Abra moria  and a fig for the Fatz man  But let the praise of Taycho be magnified  It was Taycho that subdued the fortress in the Isle Ka frit o  It was Taycho that defeated the enemy at Fla sao —Yaf frai has slain his thousands —Ya loff has slain his five thousands —but Taycho had slain his ten thousands     Taycho had credit not only for the success of the Japonese arms  but likewise    215 for the victories of Brut an tiffi  who had lately been much beholden to fortune  I have already observed what a noise that Tartar made when the Fatz man of Japan found himself obliged to capitulate with the Chinese general  In consequence of that event  the war was already at an end with respect to the Japonese  on the continent of Tartary  The emperor of China took possession of the farm of Yesso  the peasants quietly submitted to their new masters  and those very free booting Tartar chiefs  who had sold their subjects as soldiers to serve under the Fatz man  had already agreed to send the very same mercenaries into the army of China  It was at this juncture that Brut an tiffi exalted his throat  In the preceding campaign he had fought with various success  One of his generals had given battle to the Mantchoux Tartars  and each side claimed    216 the victory Another of his leaders had been defeated and taken by the Ostrog  The Chinese had already advanced to the frontiers of Brut antiffi s dominions  In this dilemma he exerted himself with equal activity and address  he repulsed the Chinese army with considerable loss  and in the space of one month after this action  gained a victory over the general of the Ostrog  These advantages rendered him insufferably arrogant  He exclaimed against the Fatz man  he threatened the Dairo  and  as I have taken notice above  a new army was raised at the expence of Japan  to defend him from all future invasions of the Chinese  Already the Tartar general Bron xi tic  who was vested at his desire with the command of the mercenary army of Japan  had given a severe check to a strong body of the Chinese  and even threatened to carry the war into the empire of    217 China  but his progress was soon stopt  and he was forced to retreat in his turn towards the farm of Yesso —But from nothing did orator Taycho reap a fuller harvest of praise  than from the conquest of Tzin khall  a settlement of the Chinese on the coast of Terra Australis  which conquest was planned by a Banyan merchant of Meaco  who had traded on that coast  and was particularly known to the king of the country  This royal savage was uneasy at the neighbourhood of the Chinese  and conjured the merchant  whose name was Thum Khumm qua  to use his influence at the court of Meaco  that an armament should be equipped against the settlement of Tzin khall  he himself solemnly promising to co operate in the reduction of it with all his forces —Thum Khumm qua  whose zeal for the good of his country got the better of all his    218 prudential maxims  did not fail to represent this object in the most interesting points of view  He demonstrated to Taycho the importance of the settlement  that it abounded with slaves  ivory  gold  and a precious gum which was not to be found in any other part of the world  a gum in great request all over Asia  and particularly among the Japonese  who were obliged to purchase it in time of war at second hand from their enemies the Chinese  at an exorbitant price  He demonstrated that the loss of this settlement would be a terrible wound to the emperor of China  and proved that the conquest
