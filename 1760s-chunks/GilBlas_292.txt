the acrimony of my ridicule  So so  good master doctor  said I  you are fairly caught in the fact  You a wine  bibber  you  who have entered the lists like a knight errant against that unauthenticated fermentation  you  who reached your grand climacteric on the strength of the pure element  How long have you been so at odds with yourself  Your time of life can be no excuse for the alteration  since  in one passage of your writings  you define old age to be a natural consumption  which withers and attenuates the system  and as an inference from that position  you reprobate the ignorance of those writers who dignify wine with the appellation of old men s milk  What can you say  therefore  in your own defence   You belabour me most unjustly  answered the old physician  If I drank neat wine  you would have a right to treat me as a deserter from my own standard  but your eyes may convince you that my wine is well mixed  Another heresy  my dear apostle of the wells and fountains  replied I  Recollect how you rated the canon SÃ©dillo for drinking wine  though plentifully dashed with the salubrious fluid  Own modestly and candidly that your theory was unfounded and fanciful  and that wine is not a poisonous liquor  as you have so falsely and scandalously libelled it in your works  any further than  like any other of nature s bounties  it may be abused to excess   This lecture sat rather uneasily on our doctor s feelings  as a candidate for consistency  He could not deny his inveteracy against the use of wine in all his publications  but pride and vanity not allowing him to acknowledge the justice of my attack on his apostasy  he was left without a word to say for himself  Not wishing to push my sarcasm beyond the bounds of good humour  I changed the subject  and after a few minutes  longer stay  took my leave  gravely exhorting him to maintain his ground against the new practitioners  Courage  Signor Sangrado  said I  never be weary of setting your wits against kermes  and deafen the health  dispensing tribe with your thunders against the use of bleeding in the feet  If  spite of all your zeal and affection for medical orthodoxy  this empiric generation should succeed in supplanting true and legitimate practice  it will be at least your consolation to have exhausted your best endeavours in the support of truth and reason   As my secretary and myself were walking to the inn  making our observations in high glee on the doctor s entertaining and original character  n man from fifty five to sixty years of age happened to pass near us in the street  walking with his eyes fixed on the ground  and a large rosary in his hand  I conned over the distinctive cut of his appearance most cunningly  and was rewarded in the recognition of Signor Manuel Ordonnez  that faithful trustee for the affairs of the hospital  of whom so honourable mention is made in the first volume of these true and instructive memoirs  Accosting him with the most profound and unquestionable tokens of respect  I paid my compliments in due form and order to the venerable and trust worthy Signor Manuel Ordonnez  the man of all the world in whose hands the interests of the poor and needy are most safely and beneficially placed  At these words he looked me steadfastly in the face  and answered that my features were not altogether strange to him  but that he could not recollect where he had seen me  I used to go backwards and forwards to your house  replied I  when one of my friends  by name Fabricio Nunez  was in your service  Ah  I recollect the circumstance at once  rejoined the worthy director with a cunning leer  and have good reason to do so  for you were a brace of pleasant lads  and were by no means backward in the little scape  grace tricks of youth and inexperience  Well  and what is become of poor Fabricio  Whenever he comes across my thoughts  I cannot help feeling a little uneasy about his temporal and eternal welfare   It was to relieve your mind upon that subject  said I to Signor Manuel  that I have taken the liberty of stopping you in the street  Fabricio is settled at Madrid  where he employs himself in publishing miscellanies and collections  What do you mean by miscellanies and collections  replied he  I mean  resumed I  that he writes in verse and prose  from epic poems and the highest branches of philosophy  down to plays  novels  epigrams  and riddles  In short  he is a lad of universal genius  and most exemplary benevolence  sometimes modestly taking to himself the credit of his own compositions  and sometimes lending out his talents to the literary ambition of those noblemen who write for their own amusement  but wish their names to be concealed  except from a chosen circle  By traffic like this he sits at the very first tables  But how does he sit at his own  said the director  upon what terms does he live with his baker  Not quite so confidentially as with people of fashion  answered I  for between ourselves  I take him to
