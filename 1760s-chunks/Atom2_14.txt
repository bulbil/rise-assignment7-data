no other than a mark of friendship  nor is it more dishonourable to be cuffed and cudgelled  Every body knows that the alapa or box o  the ear  among the Romans  was a particular mark of favour by which their slaves were made free  and the favourite gladiator  when he obtained his dismission from the service  was honoured with a found cudgelling  this being the true meaning of the phrase rude donatus  In the times of chivalry  the knight when dubbed  was well thwacked across the shoulders by his   79 god father in arms —Indeed  dubbing is no other than a corruption of drubbing  It was the custom formerly here and elsewhere  for a man to drub his son or apprentice as a mark of his freedom  and of his being admitted to the exercise of arms  The Paraschistes  who practised embalming in Aegypt  which was counted a very honourable profession  was always severely drubbed after the operation  by the friends and relations of the defunct  and to this day  the patriarch of the Greeks once a year  on Easter eve  when he carries out the sacred fire from the holy sepulchre of Jerusalem  is heartily cudgelled by the infidels  a certain number of whom he hires for that purpose  and he thinks himself very unhappy and much disgraced  if he is not beaten into all the colours of the rain bow  You know the Quakers of this country think it no dishonour   80 to receive a slap o  the face  but when you smite them on one cheek  they present the other  that it may have the same salutation  The venerable father Lactantius falls out with Cicero for saying     A good man hurts no body  unless he is justly provoked    nisi lacessitur injuria  O   cries the good father  quam simplicem veramque sententiam duorum verborum adjectione corrupit —non minus enim mali est  referre injuriam  quam inferre  The great philosopher Socrates thought it no disgrace to be kicked by his wife Xantippe  nay  he is said to have undergone the same discipline from other people  without making the least resistance  it being his opinion that it was more courageous  consequently more honourable  to bear a drubbing patiently  than to attempt any thing either in the way of self defence or retaliation —The judicious and learned Puffendorf  in   81 his book De Jure Gentium   Naturali  declares  that a man s honour is not so fragile as to be hurt either by a box on the ear  or a kick on the breech  otherwise it would be in the power of every saucy fellow to diminish or infringe it —It must be owned  indeed  Grotius De Jure Belli   Pacis  says  that charity does not of itself require our patiently suffering such an affront  The English have with a most servile imitation  borrowed their punto  as well as other modes  from the French nation  Now kicking and cuffing were counted infamous among those people for these reasons  A box on the ear destroys the whole oeconomy of their frisure  upon which they bestow the greatest part of their time and attention  and a kick on the breech is attended with great pain and danger  as they are generally subject to the piles  This is so truly the case  that they have   82 no less than two saints to patronize and protect the individuals afflicted with this disease  One is St  Fiacre  who was a native of the kingdom of Ireland  He presides over the blind piles  The other is a female saint  Hoemorrhoissa  and she comforts those who are distressed with the bleeding piles  No wonder  therefore  that a Frenchman put to the torture by a kick on those tender parts  should be provoked to vengeance  and that this vengeance should gradually become an article in their system of punctilio     But  to return to the thread of my narration —Whatever inclination the Dairo and Yak strot had to restore the blessings of peace  they did not think proper as yet to combat the disposition and schemes of Orator Taycho  in consequence of whose remonstrances  the tributary treaty was immediately renewed with Brut an tiffi  and Gio gio declared in the   83 assembly of the people  that he was determined to support that illustrious ally  and carry on the war with vigour —By this time the Chinese were in a manner expelled from their chief settlements in Fatsisio  where they now retained nothing but an inconsiderable colony  which would have submitted on the first summons  but this Taycho left as a nest egg to produce a new brood of disturbance to the Japonese settlements  that they might not rust with too much peace and security  To be plain with you  Peacock  his thoughts were entirely alienated from this Fatsisian war  in which the interest of his country was chiefly concerned  and converted wholly to the continent of Tartary  where all his cares centered in schemes for the success of his friend Brut an tiffi  This freebooter had lately undergone strange vicissitudes of fortune  He had seen   84 his chief village possessed and plundered by the enemy  but he found means  by surprize  to beat up their quarters in the beginning of winter  which always proved his best ally
