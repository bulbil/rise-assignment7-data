now so implacably incensed  If she is not satisfied       with the pangs of remorse and disappointment  the transports       of madness I have undergone  let her prescribe what further       penance she thinks I ought to endure  and when I decline her       sentence  let me be the object of her eternal disdain        I commit myself  dear madam  dear Sophy  dear partner of my       Friend  to your kind interposition  I know you will manage       my cause  as a concern on which my happiness entirely       depends  and I hope everything from your compassion and       beneficence  while I fear everything from her rigour and       barbarity  Yes  I call it barbarity  a savageness of delicacy       altogether inconsistent with the tenderness of human nature        and may the most abject contempt be my portion  if I live       under its scourge  But I begin to rave  I conjure you by your       own humanity and sweetness of disposition  I conjure you by       your love for the man whom Heaven hath decreed your protector        to employ your influence with that angel of wrath  in behalf       of your obliged and obedient servant               P  PICKLE    This epistle was immediately transmitted by Godfrey to his wife  who  perused it with marks of the most humane sympathy  and  carrying it  into her sister s chamber   Here is something   said she  presenting the  paper   which I must recommend to your serious attention   Emilia  who  immediately guessed the meaning of this address  absolutely refused to  look upon it  or even to hear it read  till her brother  entering her  apartment  reprimanded her sharply for her obstinacy and pride  accused  her of folly and dissimulation  and entered so warmly into the interests  of his friend  that she thought him unkind in his remonstrances  and   bursting into a flood of tears  reproached him with partiality and  want of affection  Godfrey  who entertained the most perfect love and  veneration for his sister  asked pardon for having given offence  and   kissing the drops from her fair eyes  begged she would  for his sake   listen to the declaration of his friend   Thus solicited  she could not refuse to hear the letter  which  when he  had repeated  she lamented her own fate in being the occasion of so much  uneasiness  desired her brother to assure Mr  Pickle that she was not  a voluntary enemy to his peace  on the contrary  she wished him all  happiness  though she hoped he would not blame her for consulting her  own  in avoiding any future explanation or connection with a person    6 22 15  3 45 PM   whose correspondence she found herself under a necessity to renounce  In  vain did the new married couple exhaust their eloquence in attempting  to prove  that the reparation which our hero had offered was adequate to  the injury she had sustained  that in reconciling herself to a penitent  lover  who subscribed to her own terms of submission  her honour would  be acquitted by the most scrupulous and severe judges of decorum   and that her inflexibility would be justly ascribed to the pride  and insensibility of her heart  She turned a deaf ear to all their  arguments  exhortations  and entreaties  and threatened to leave the  house immediately  if they would not promise to drop that subject of  discourse   Godfrey  very much chagrined at the bad success of his endeavours   returned to his friend  and made as favourable a report of the affair   as the nature of his conversation with Emilia would permit  but as he  could not avoid mentioning her resolution in the close  Peregrine was  obliged to drink again the bitter draught of disappointment  which put  his passions into such a state of agitation  as produced a short ecstasy  of despair  in which he acted a thousand extravagances  This paroxysm   however  soon subsided into a settled reserve of gloomy resentment   which he in secret indulged  detaching himself  as soon as possible   from the company of the soldier  on pretence of retiring to rest   While he lay ruminating upon the circumstances of his present situation   his friend Pipes  who knew the cause of his anxiety  and firmly believed  that Emilia loved his master at her heart  howsoever she might attempt  to disguise her sentiments  I say  Thomas was taken with a conceit  which he thought would set everything to rights  and therefore put it in  execution without further delay  Laying aside his hat  he ran
