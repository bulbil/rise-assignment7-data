my brother she meant  who is a surgeon  and I believe  madam  she has mentioned him to you  as one that is reckoned pretty skilful in his business  One of the gentlemen immediately said  by all means let him be sent for directly  My brother was soon fetched  and he thought proper to bleed my master in the arm  He would not take the dressings off his head  as the other surgeon had declared the skull was not touched  but said  he would be present when the wound was dressed the next day  and would watch all night by my master   My lady was not to be removed from the bed side  nor could we persuade her to take any sustenance the whole day  My poor master was in a high fever all night  and I thought he strove to stifle his groans  that my lady might not hear them  She did for all that  and I    am sure every one of them was worse than a dagger to her heart  She stole out of the room several times for a minute  and I could hear her bursting into tears as soon as she was without side the door  then she would come in again  and sit by him  till her heart was again so full  she was forced to go out to give it vent  The whole night passed over in this dismal way   When my master’s head was examined the next day  my brother found that the skull was not touched where he had received the cut  but that it was broke in two other places  and in so dangerous a way  that it was impossible to save his life  as it was not in a part where he could be trepanned  The other surgeon  who found he had been mistaken at first  now joined with my brother in opinion that the world could not save my master’s life  Oh  madam  if you had seen my lady when this was declared to her  I shall never forget her looks  I remember a piece of fine painting at your house  which I used to hear your family commend mightily  It was the picture of despair  My lady put me in mind of this piece  she had the very countenance of it  but I think  if she had then sat to a painter  he could have made a stronger and more heart breaking look even than that picture has   Such another dismal day and night I believe never was passed in this house  My brother staid with us  though he could do but little service  except to watch my poor master  for he was between whiles quite out of his reason— No rest did my lady take all last night  She could not be got out of the room  she has tasted nothing these two days  nor slept a wink these two nights—She will destroy herself—What will become of us —I have wrote to my lady Bidulph  to let her know the deplorable condition we are all in—My God  what will become of the poor children  if my lady goes on at this rate  She cannot hold out to be sure  such a load of sorrow at her heart  without nourishment or sleep—Oh  my good madam  I am not able to go on with my task—We have not the least hopes in the world—My master grows worse and worse every hour  he has his reason now  and is sensible that he is dying  Heaven knows  if I could lay down my life to save his  how gladly would I do it  I should be no loss  but he will be a grievous one—  Lord help me  I am not able to go on—I have writ this by bits and scraps—   Mr Main in continuation      May 16  Three o’clock in the Morning   Mr Arnold had been delirious the greatest part of yesterday  but about six o’clock in the evening  having come a little to his senses  he was conscious that he was going fast  and desired that prayers might be read by him  His lady sent for the minister of the parish  but he was gone to London  the gentleman whom he had left to do his duty  was taken ill the night before  and was not able to leave his bed  He sent the messager that went for him  to another clergyman  who lived about four miles farther off  to request he would attend in his stead  but he was engaged on the same duty in his own parish  and could not come  he said  till next morning  The servant had wasted above two hours on this errand  it was nine o’clock when he returned  Mr Arnold during this interval had had several ramblings  but was now again a little composed  though apparently worse  I whispered the apothecary  who just then came in  that he could not live ’till morning  Mrs Arnold observed me  and begged to know what I said  I told her tenderly  that I feared Mr Atkins  that was the clergyman’s name  would arrive too late  if he deferred his visit ’till next day   She made me no answer  but seemed to study a little  then went composedly to Mr Arnold’s
