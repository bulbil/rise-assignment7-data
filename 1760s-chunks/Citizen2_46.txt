more deference to the sex than you seem to imagine  As you of Europe say grace  upon sitting down to dinner  so it is the custom in China to say grace  when a man goes to bed to his wife  And may I die  returned my companion  but a very pretty ceremony  for seriously  Sir  I see no reason why a man should not he as grateful in one situation as in the other  Upon honour  I always find myself much   140 more disposed to gratitude  on the couch of a fine woman  than upon sitting down to a sirloin of beef   Another ceremony  said I  resuming the conversation  in favour of the sex amongst us  is the bride s being allowed after marriage  her three days of freedom  During this interval a thousand extravagancies are practised by either sex  The lady is placed upon the nuptial bed  and numberless monkey tricks are played round to divert her  One gentleman smells her perfumed handkerchief  another attempts to untie her garters  a third pulls off her shoe to play hunt the slipper  another pretends to be an ideot  and endeavours to raise a laugh by grimacing  in the mean time  the glass goes briskly about  till ladies  gentlemen  wife  husband  and all are mixed together in one inundation of arrack punch    Strike me dumb  deaf  and blind  cried my companion  but very pretty  there s some sense in your Chinese ladies condescentions  but among us  you shall scarce find one of the whole sex that shall hold her good humour for three days together  No later than yesterday I happened to say some civil things to a citizen s wife of my acquaintance  not because I loved  but because I had charity  and what do you think was the tender creature s reply  Only that she detested my pigtail wig  high heeled shoes  and sallow complexion  That is all  Nothing more  Yes  by the heavens  though she was more ugly than an unpainted actress  I found her more insolent than a thorough bred woman of quality      141He was proceeding in this wild manner  when his invective was interrupted  by the man in black  who entered the apartment  introducing his neice  a young lady of exquisite beauty  Her very appearance was sufficient to silence the severest satyrist of the sex  easy without pride  and free without impudence  she seemed capable of supplying every sense with pleasure  her looks  her conversation were natural and unconstrained  she had neither been taught to languish nor ogle  to laugh without a jest  or sigh without sorrow  I found that she had just returned from abroad  and had been conversant in the manners of the world  Curiosity prompted me to ask several questions  but she declined them all  I own I never found myself so strongly prejudiced in favour of apparent merit before  and could willingly have prolonged our conversation  but the company after some time withdrew  Just  however  before the little beau took his leave he called me aside  and requested I would change him a twenty pound bill  which as I was incapable of doing  he was contented with borrowing half a crown   Adieu   LETTER XCVII  From Lien Chi Altangi to Hinpgo  by the way of Moscow   FEW virtues have been more praised by moralists  than generosity  every practical treatise of Ethics tends to encrease our sensibility of the distresses of others  and to relax the grasp of frugality    142 Philosophers that are poor  praise it because they are gainers by its effects  and the opulent Seneca himself has written a treatise on benefits  though he was known to give nothing away   But among the many who have enforced the duty of giving  I m surprised there are none to inculcate the ignominy of receiving  to shew that by every favour we accept  we in some measure forfeit our native freedom  and that a state of continual dependance on the generosity of others is a life of gradual debasement   Were men taught to despise the receiving obligations with the same force of reasoning and declamation that they are instructed to confer them  we might then see every person in society filling up the requisite duties of his station with chearful industry  neither relaxed by hope  nor sullen from disappointment   Every favour a man receives  in some measure sinks him below his dignity  and in proportion to the value of the benefit  or the frequency of its acceptance  he gives up so much of his natural independance  He therefore  who thrives upon the unmerited bounty of another  if he h•• any sensibility  suffers the worst of servitude  the shackled slave may murmur without reproach  but the humble dependant is taxed with ingratitude upon every symptom of discontent  the one may rave round the walls of his cell  but the other lingers in all the silence of mental confinement  To encrease his distress  every new obligation but adds to the former load which kept the vigorous mind from rising  till at last  elastic no   143 longer  it shapes itself to constraint  and puts on habitual servility   It is thus with the feeling mind  but there
