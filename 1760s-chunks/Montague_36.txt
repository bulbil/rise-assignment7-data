can t think how comfortable we feel at Silleri  out of the way       My father says  the politics of Canada are as complex and as difficult to be understood as those of the Germanic system       For my part  I think no politics worth attending to but those of the little commonwealth of woman  if I can maintain my empire over hearts  I leave the men to quarrel for every thing else       I observe a strict neutrality  that I may have a chance for admirers amongst both parties  Adieu  the post is just going out   Your faithful  A  FERMOR     LETTER XLVI   46   To Miss MONTAGUE  at Silleri   Montreal  Dec  18   THERE is something  my dear Emily  in what you say as to the delicacy of your situation  but  whilst you are so very exact in acting up to it on one side  do you not a little overlook it on the other       I am extremely unwilling to say a disagreable thing to you  but Miss Fermor is too young as well as too gay to be a protection the very particular circumstance you mention makes Mr  Melmoth s the only house in Canada in which  if I have any judgment  you can with propriety live till your marriage takes place       You extremely injure Sir George in supposing it possible he should fail in his engagements  and I see with pain that you are more quicksighted to his failings than is quite consistent with that tenderness  which  allow me to say  he has a right to expect from you  He is like other men of his age and fortune  he is the very man you so lately thought amiable  and of whose love you cannot without injustice have a doubt       Though I approve your contempt of the false glitter of the world  yet I think it a little strained at your time of life  did I not know you as well as I do  I should say that philosophy in a young and especially a female mind  is so out of season  as to be extremely suspicious  The pleasures which attend on affluence are too great  and too pleasing to youth  to be overlooked  except when under the influence of a livelier passion       Take care  my Emily  I know the goodness of your heart  but I also know it s sensibility  remember that  if your situation requires great circumspection in your behaviour to Sir George  it requires much greater to every other person  it is even more delicate than marriage itself       I shall expect you and Miss Fermor as soon as the roads are such that you can travel agreably  and  as you object to Sir George as a conductor  I will entreat Captain Fermor to accompany you hither       I am  my dear   Your most affectionate  E  MELMOTH    LETTER XLVII   47   To Mrs  MELMOTH  at Montreal   Silleri  Dec  26   I ENTREAT you  my dearest Madam  to do me the justice to believe I see my engagement to Sir George in as strong a light as you can do  if there is any change in my behaviour to him  it is owing to the very apparent one in his conduct to me  of which no one but myself can be a judge  As to what you say in regard to my contempt of affluence  I can only say it is in my character  whether it is generally in the female one or not       Were the cruel hint you are pleased to give just  be assured Sir George should be the first person to whom I would declare it  I hope however it is possible to esteem merit without offending even the most sacred of all engagements       A gentleman waits for this  I have only time to say  that Miss Fermor thanks you for your obliging invitation  and promises she will accompany me to Montreal as soon as the river St  Lawrence will bear carriages  as the upper road is extremely inconvenient       I am    My dearest Madam       Your obliged            and faithful  EMILY MONTAGUE     LETTER XLVIII   48   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Silleri  Dec  27   AFTER a fortnight s snow  we have had near as much clear blue sky and sunshine  the snow is six feet deep  so that we may be said to walk on our own heads  that is  speaking en philosophe  we occupy the space we should have done in summer if we had done so  or  to explain it more clearly  our heels are now where our heads should be       The scene is a little changed for the worse  the lovely landscape is now one undistinguished waste of snow  only a little diversified by the great variety of ever greens in the woods  the romantic winding path down the side of the hill to our farm  on which we used to amuse ourselves with seeing the beaux serpentize  is now a confused  frightful  rugged precipice  which one trembles at the idea of ascending
