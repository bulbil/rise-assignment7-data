to take   notice of me  Pray  sir  if I have not been worse than others  why   should I suffer more than others  and why should I not be turned away    and there s an end of it  For indeed I am not of consequence enough for   my master to concern himself  and be angry about such a creature as me       Do you hear  Mrs  Jervis  cried he again  how pertly I am interrogated   by this saucy slut  Why  sauce box  says he  did not my good   mother desire me to take care of you  And have you not been always   distinguished by me  above a common servant  And does your ingratitude   upbraid me for this       I said something mutteringly  and he vowed he would hear it  I begged   excuse  but he insisted upon it  Why  then  said I  if your honour must   know  I said  That my good lady did not desire your care to extend to   the summer house  and her dressing room       Well  this was a little saucy  you ll say  And he flew into such a   passion  that I was forced to run for it  and Mrs  Jervis said  It was   happy I got out of the way       Why what makes him provoke one so  then   I m almost sorry for it  but   I would be glad to get away at any rate  For I begin to be more fearful   now       Just now Mr  Jonathan sent me these lines   Bless me  what shall I do         Dear Mrs  Pamela  Take care of yourself  for Rachel heard my master say   to Mrs  Jervis  who  she believes  was pleading for you  Say no more    Mrs  Jervis  for by G  d I will have her  Burn this instantly        O pray for your poor daughter  I am called to go to bed by Mrs  Jervis    for it is past eleven  and I am sure she shall hear of it  for all this   is owing to her  though she did not mean any harm  But I have been  and   am  in a strange fluster  and I suppose too  she ll say  I have been   full pert       O my dear father and mother  power and riches never want advocates  But    poor gentlewoman  she cannot live without him  and he has been very good   to her       So good night  May be I shall send this in the morning  but may be not    so won t conclude  though I can t say too often  that I am  though with   great apprehension                            Your most dutiful DAUGHTER                LETTER XXV         MY DEAR PARENTS       O let me take up my complaint  and say  Never was poor creature so   unhappy  and so barbarously used  as poor Pamela  Indeed  my dear father   and mother  my heart s just broke  I can neither write as I should do    nor let it alone  for to whom but you can I vent my griefs  and keep my   poor heart from bursting  Wicked  wicked man   I have no patience when   I think of him   But yet  don t be frightened  for  I hope  I hope  I am   honest   But if my head and my hand will let me  you shall hear all   Is   there no constable  nor headborough  though  to take me out of his   house  for I am sure I can safely swear the peace against him  But    alas  he is greater than any constable  he is a justice himself  Such a   justice deliver me from   But God Almighty  I hope  in time  will right   me  For he knows the innocence of my heart       John went your way in the morning  but I have been too much distracted   to send by him  and have seen nobody but Mrs  Jervis or Rachel  and   one I hate to see or be seen by and indeed I hate now to see any body    Strange things I have to tell you  that happened since last night  that   good Mr  Jonathan s letter  and my master s harshness  put me into such   a fluster  but
