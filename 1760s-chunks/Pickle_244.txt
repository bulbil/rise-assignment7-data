without  emotion  but time  company  amusements  and change of place  in a great  measure dissipated these ideas  and enabled me to bear my fate with  patience and resignation    On my last arrival at Paris  I was surrounded by a crowd of professed  admirers  who sighed and flattered in the usual forms  but  besides  that my heart was not in a condition to contract new engagements  I was  prepossessed against them all  by supposing that they presumed upon  the knowledge of my indiscretion with S    and therefore rejected their  addresses with detestation and disdain  for  as I have already observed   I was not to be won but by the appearance of esteem  and the most  respectful carriage  and though  by a false step  I had  in my own  opinion  forfeited my title to the one  I was resolved to discourage the  advances of any man who seemed deficient in the other    In this manner my lovers were one by one repulsed  almost as soon as  they presented themselves  and I preserved the independence of my heart   until I became acquainted with a certain peer  whom I often saw at the  house of Mrs  P    an English lady then resident at Paris  This young  nobleman professed himself deeply enamoured of me  in a style so  different from that of my other admirers  that I heard his protestations  without disgust  and  though my inclinations were still free  could not  find in my heart to discountenance his addresses  which were preferred  with the most engaging modesty  disinterestedness  and respect    By these never failing arts  he gradually conquered my indifference   and gained the preference in my esteem from Lord C   and the prince of  C    who were at that time his rivals  But what contributed more than  any consideration to his success was his declaring openly  that he would  marry me without hesitation  as soon as I could obtain a divorce from  my present husband  which  in all probability  might have been easily  procured  for  before I left England  Lord    had offered me five  thousand pounds if I would consent to such a mutual release  that he  might be at liberty to espouse one Miss W    of Kent  to whom he then  made love upon honourable terms  but I was fool enough to refuse his  proposal  by the advice of S    And whether or not his lordship  finding  it impracticable to wed his new mistress  began to make love upon  another footing  I know not  but  certain it is  the mother forbade  him the house  a circumstance which he took so heinously ill  that  he appealed to the world in a public advertisement  beginning with   Whereas  for some time  I have passionately loved Miss W    and  upon  my not complying with the mother s proposals  they have turned me out of  doors  this is to justify   etc    This declaration  signed with his name  was actually printed in a  number of detached advertisements  which he ordered to be distributed to  the public  and afterwards  being convinced by some of his friends    6 22 15  3 45 PM   that he had done a very silly thing  he recalled them at half a guinea  apiece  A copy of one of them was sent to me at Paris  and I believe my  father has now one of the originals in his possession  After this wise  vindication of his conduct  he made an attempt to carry off the lady  from church by force of arms  but she was rescued by the neighbours   headed by her brother  who  being an attorney  had like to have made his  lordship smart severely for this exploit    Meanwhile my new admirer had made some progress in my heart  and  my  finances being exhausted  I was reduced to the alternative of returning  to Lord    again  or accepting Earl B   s love  When my affairs were  brought to an issue  I made no hesitation in my choice  putting myself  under the protection of a man of honour whom I esteemed  rather than  suffer every sort of mortification from a person who was the object of  my abhorrence and contempt  From a mistaken pride  I chose to live in  Lord B   s house  rather than be maintained at his expense in another  place  We spent several months agreeably in balls and other diversions   visited Lord B    who lived at the distance of a few leagues from Paris   and stayed some days at his house  where the entertainment was  in all  respects  delightful  elegant  and refined  Their habitation was the  rendezvous of the best company in France  and Lady B   maintained  the same superiority in her own sex  for which her lord is so justly  distinguished among the men
