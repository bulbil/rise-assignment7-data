will  I hope  by my care of him  to be an humble means of prolonging his life  at least of making his latter days chearful   What a happy season has this been to scores of people in our neighbourhood  but most to ourselves  as the giver is more blessed than the receiver  Such admirable management  Such good order —But I told you  that all was left to Dr  Bartlett s direction  What a blessing is he to us  and all around him   Sir Charles has a Letter from Mr  Lowther  who is on his return from Bologna  By the date it should have arrived a fortnight ago  So that he may be every day expected     63 Mr  Lowther lets him know  that the family at Bologna are all in spirits  on the prospect they have of carrying their point with Lady Clementina  who  however  for the present  declines the visits of the Count of Belvedere  and they humour her in that particular   Mr  Lowther is afraid  he says  that all is not quite right as to her mind  Poor Lady  He judges so  from the very great earnestness she continues to express to make a visit to England   She received  he says  with great intrepidity  the news of Sir Charles s marriage  She besought a blessing upon him and his bride  but since has been thoughtful  reserved  and sometimes is found in tears  When challenged  she ascribed  once  her grief to her apprehensions that her malady may possibly return   The physicians have absolutely given their opinion  that she should marry   The General is expected from Naples to urge the solemnity  and vows  that he will not return till she is actually Countess of Belvedere   She begs  that she may be allowed again to pass the Apennines  and visit Mrs  Beaumont at Florence  in order to settle her mind   She dreads to see the General   How I am grieved for her —Sir Charles must be afflicted too  Why  why  will they not leave to time  the pacifier of every woe  the issue of the event upon which they have set their hearts   Mr  Lowther writes  that Signor Jeronymo is in a fine way   Mr  Lowther in his Letter acquits Sir Charles of all obligation to himself  He returns him bills for the sum he had advanced  and declares  that he never will enter into his presence  if he refuses to accept of his acquittance  The family  he tells him  have nobly rewarded him   Dr  Bartlett applauds Mr  Lowther s spirit on this   64 occasion  As Sir Charles  he says  is not an ostentatious man  but judges of every thing  according to the rules of right and prudence  he has no doubt  tho  he might not expect this handsome treatment  but he will acquiesce with it  This  however  lessens not the comparative merit of Mr  Lowther  There are men  I believe  who having succeeded so well  would have accepted of a reward from both parties  Yet  on recollection  Sir Charles stipulated with Mr  Lowther  that he should receive no fee  but from himself  And his present to the worthy man was the ampler on that account   I have two charming Letters from the Countess of D  By her permission  I have shewn to Sir Charles the correspondence between that good Lady and me  He greatly admires her  She desires  that he will be acquainted with her son  and declares  she will always look upon me as her daughter  and call me so  Sir Charles bids me tell her  that he cannot consent to her calling me so  unless she will look upon him as her son  and unless my Lord will allow him to call him brother  He bid me express his wishes of a friendship with both  answerable to that desirable relation   My uncle says  he knows not such a place as Selby house  Shirley manor indeed he loves for the sake of the dear mistress of it  But  as long as he has with him his Dame  his Harriet  Mr  Deane  and Sir Charles  he is happy  Yet my aunt now and then gets upon a rising ground in the park  and asks  pointing  Does not Northamptonshire lie off there   Emily is very good in the main  Dear girl  I do pity her  Her young heart  so early to be tried and tormented by the stings of hopeless Love —Her eyes just now were fixed for several minutes  so much Love in them  on the face of her guardian  that his modest eye sell under them   I will give you  on this occasion  the particulars   65 of a conversation  that passed between us  which  at the conclusion  let in a little dawn of hope  that the dear girl may be happy in time   I had more than once been apprehensive  that her eyes would betray her to her guardian  who at present imputes all her reverence for him to gratitude  and as soon as he was withdrawn
