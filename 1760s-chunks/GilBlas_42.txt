by twenty or thirty wax candles  Several servants were in waiting  of whom the lady inquired whether Don Raphael was come  They answered  No  She then addressed herself to me  Signor Gil Blas  I am waiting for my brother s return from a country seat of ours  about two leagues distant  What an agreeable surprise will it be to him to find a man under his roof to whom our family is so much indebted  At the very moment she had finished this pretty speech we heard a noise  and were informed at the same time that it was occasioned by the arrival of Don Raphael  This spark soon made his appearance  He was a young man of portly figure and genteel manners  I am in ecstacy to see you back again  brother  said the lady  you will assist me in doing the honours to Signor Gil Blas of Santillane  We can never do enough to show our sense of his kindness to our kinswoman  Donna Mencia  Here  read this letter I have just received  Don Raphael opened the envelope  and read aloud as follows   My dear Camilla  Signor Gil Blas of Santillane  the saviour of my honour and my life  has just set out for court  He will of course pass through Valladolid  I conjure you by our family connection  and still more by our indissoluble friendship  to give him an hospitable reception  and to detain him for some time as your guest  I flatter myself that you will so far oblige me  and that my deliverer will receive every kind of polite attention from yourself  and my cousin  Don Raphael  Your affectionate cousin   DONNA MENCIA   Burgos   What  cried Don Raphael  casting his eyes again over the letter  is it to this gentleman my kinswoman owes her honour and her life  Then heaven be praised for this happy meeting  With this sort of language  he advanced to wards me  and squeezing me tightly in his arms  What joy to me is it  added he  to have the honour of seeing Signor Gil Blas of Santillane  My cousin the marchioness had no need to press the hospitality  Had she only told us simply that you were passing through Valladolid  that would have been enough  My sister Camilla and I shall be at no loss how to conduct ourselves towards a young gentleman who has conferred an obligation  not to be repaid  on her of all our family most tenderly beloved by us  I made the best answer I could to these speeches  which were followed by many others of the same kind  and interlarded with a thousand bows and scrapes  But Lord bless me  he has his boots on  The servants were ordered in  to take them ofF   We next went into another room  where the cloth was lain  Down we sat at table  the brother  sister  and myself  They paid me a hundred compliments during supper  Not a word escaped me  but they magnified it into an admirable hit  It was impossible not to observe the assiduity with which they both helped me out of every dish  Don Raphael often pledged me to Donna Mencia s health  I could not refuse the challenge  and it looked a little as if Camilla  who was a very good companion  ogled at me with no questionable meaning  I even thought I could perceive that she watched her opportunity  as if she was afraid of being detected by her brother  An oracle could not have convinced me more firmly that the lady was caught  and I looked forward to a little delicate amusement from the discovery  during the short time I was to stay at Valladolid  That hope was my tempter to comply with the request they made me  of condescending to pass a few days with them  They thanked me kindly for indulging them with my company  and Camilla s restrained  but visible transport  confirmed me in the opinion that I was not altogether disagreeable in her eyes   Don Raphael  finding I had made up my mind to be his guest for a few days  proposed to take me to his country house  The description of it was magnificent  and the round of amusements he meditated for me was not to be described  At one time  said he  we will take the diversion of the chase  at another that of fishing  and whenever you have a mind for a saunter  we have charming woods and gardens  In addition  we shall have agreeable society  I flatter myself you will not find the time hang heavy on your hands  I accepted the invitation  and it was agreed that we should go to this fine country house the following day  We rose from the table with this pleasant scheme in our mouths  Don Raphael seemed in ecstacy  Signor Gil Blas  said he  embracing me  I leave you with my sister  I am going presently to give the necessary orders  and send invitations round to the families I wish to be of the party  With these words he sallied forth from the room where we were sitting  I went on chatting with the lady  whose topics of discourse did not bely the glances of her expressive eyes  She took me by the hand
