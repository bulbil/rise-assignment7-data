lively Emblems of yourself  sensible  philosophic  affectionate  and polite   I am always sincerely pleased  when any little Error or Weakness of mine gives my ever dear Page  113 Preceptor an Opportunity of setting his little Pupil right  And the Trouble you have taken  on this Occasion  is doubly kind  for  as all the present and past Actions of your Life  toward me  may fully justify the Excess of my Affection for you  another Man might have thought it needless to satisfy the nice Scruples of a weak or delicate Mind  but thou  the dear Dispenser of all Heaven s Bounty to me  hast convinced me  that it is both my Duty and Happiness  as well as it was my Inclination  to indulge that tender  chaste  and inviolable Affection  which I feel for thee  thou most deserving of thy Sex  Nor would change even those Pains thy Absence gives me  for the dull Insensibility in which the common Race of Mortals pass their Lives  though I confess these Pains imbitter every Hour of Life  for even while you are with me  my Thoughts are continually filled with the sad Idea of our Parting —and  indeed  it is dreadful to think of passing the Morn of Life  the Season for tender Converse  domestic Happiness  and social Joys  the Remembrance of which should gild the down hill Path  the Evening Tide of Life  in a State of Separation from all we love  to have the fleeting Days of Youth pass  like a Dream  unmarked by any pleasing Aera  or interesting Event  Not but I agree with Milton and Shaftsbury  that they know not their own Interest  who wish never to be separated from Page  114 those they truly love    for Solitude is sometimes best Society  and short Retirement urges sweet Return   But mine is  I think  a perpetual State of Banishment  for the Months you are from me appear like Centuries  and the few Days you are with me fly away like the Moments of a dying Man  who knows he has but one short Hour to live  or seem  at best  but like the wretched Exile s Interval of taking Leave for Life     However  I will  henceforward  remember that Happiness is reserved for Immortality  and learn to consider those Anxieties  which the Tenderness of my Affection sometimes occasions  as the Purchase of that Felicity  which it has  and I hope will still continue to produce  I mean the redoubled Joys of meeting   What you say  with Regard to the Resentment I express d upon Tom s Behaviour  is very just  but I own my Nature is warm  and impatient of Injuries  especially when they are loaded with the vile Weight of Ingratitude  but  believe me  Harry  I have a Heart as tender  and a Hand as open to soft Compassion  and to melting Charity  even as your generous Self  but I confess  with a Kind of Pride not to be described  that  in the stoical Habitude of subduing the first Impulse of Passion  and attending to the Dictates of Reason and Humanity  you have  as in every thing else  a considerable Advantage Page  115 over me  You are  indeed  the steady Rock  that keeps one even Course  and I the unsettled Cloud below  liable to the Gust of every varying Wind  which veers it from it s purposed Bearing   There is really something singular in my Affection for you  which makes me triumph at every Mark of your Superiority in Sense or Virtue  even over myself  and I feel a more exulting Pleasure at being excelled by you  than I should in being superior to all the World beside  Perhaps this may be owing to my having placed my chief Merit and Happiness in the Tenderness and Excess of my Love   and there alone I will not yield the Prize  even to you   and as every new Proof of your Worth confirms and justifies the ruling Passion of my Soul  I am doubly pleased and grateful for it   I will not yet despair of your Success with your petrified Patronymic  for I depend on your Perseverance  and constant Dropping wears at length the Marble  Besides  you find that the Proposal you made him  two Months ago  has at last made it s Way  and penetrated into his most obdurate Brain  So I take it for granted  that your last Offer is travelling the same round about Road  and may  in the same Time  arrive  much fatigued with the tedious Barrenness of the Way  at the same Inn  and truly I think an Inn a proper Simile for his Brain  where neither Page  116 Sense nor Science take up their Rest  where every thing passes in dull Rotation  and leaves no more Impression than   the Remembrance of a Guest  who tarrieth but a Night   If I were Genie of the Black Isles  mentioned in the Arabian Tales  I would certainly take Measure of him  with my Wand  for a compleat Suit of Marble  his Wig  at least  should  eternal buckle take in Parian Stone     I should have been glad to have known
