upper house  they seemed resolutely bent upon punishing him  and a day was appointed for trying him before the Lords at Westminster Hall  Mean while  the Tories  who  one and all  approved his principles    104 were as violent in his defence as the parliament had been in his prosecution  The eyes of the kingdom were turned upon this extraordinary tryal  the Queen herself was every day present as a private spectator  His tryal lasted some days  and vast multitudes attended him each day  as he went to the hall  shouting  and praying for his success  The body of the people espoused his cause  They destroyed several meeting houses  and plundered the dwellings of Dissenters  and the Queen herself could not but relish those doctrines which contributed to extend her prerogative  The Lords were divided  they continued undetermined for some time  but  at length  after much obstinate dispute and virulent altercation  Sacheverel was found guilty by a majority of seventeen voices  He was prohibited from preaching  for the term of three years  his two sermons were ordered to be burnt by the hands of the common hangman  The lenity of this sentence was considered  by the Tories  as a victory  and  in fact  their faction took the lead all the remaining part of this reign   The King of France  long persecuted by fortune  and each hour fearing for his capital  once more petitioned for peace  Godolphin and Marlborough  who had  since the beginning of the war  enjoyed the double advantage of extending their glory  and increasing their fortunes  were intirely averse to any negotiation which tended to diminish both  The Tories  on the other hand  willing to humble the general  and his partner Godolphin  were sincerely desirous of a peace  as the only measure to attain their ends  A conference was  at length  begun at Gertruydenberg  under the influence of Marlborough  Eugene  and Zinzendorf  all three entirely averse to the treaty  The French ministers were subjected to every species of mortification  their conduct narrowly watched  their master insulted  and their letters   105 opened  They offered to satisfy every complaint that had given rise to the war  they consented to abandon Philip IV  in Spain  to grant the Dutch a large barrier  they even consented to grant a supply towards dethroning Philip  but even this offer was treated with contempt  and at length the conference was broken off  while Lewis resolved to hazard another campaign   The designs of the Dutch  and the English general  were too obvious not to be seen  and properly explained by their enemies in England  The writers of the Tory faction  who were men of the first rank of literary merit  displayed the avarice of the Duke and the self interested conduct of the Dutch  they insisted  that  while England was exhausting her strength in foreign conquests  she was losing her liberty at home  that her ministers were not contented with sharing the plunder of an impoverishing state  but were resolved upon destroying its liberties also  To these complaints were added the real pride of the then prevailing ministry  and the insolence of the Duchess of Marlborough  who hitherto had possessed more real power than the whole privy council united  Mrs  Masham  who had first been recommended to the Queen s favour by the Duchess  now fairly supplanted her patroness  and  by a steady attention to please the Queen  had gained all that confidence which she had reposed in her former confidante  It was too late that the Duchess perceived this alienation of the Queen s favour  and now began to think of repairing it by demanding an audience of her Majesty  in order to vindicate her character from every suspicion  but formal explanations ever widen the breach   Mr  Hill  brother to the new favourite  was appointed by the Queen to be colonel of a regiment  this the Duke of Marlborough could by no means approve  He expostulated with his sovereign  he   106 retired in disgust  the Queen  by a letter  gave him eave to dispose of the regiment as he should think proper  but  before it came to his hands  he had sent a letter to the Queen  desiring she would permit him to retire from his employments  This was the conjuncture which the Tories had long wished for  and which the Queen herself was internally pleased with  She now perceived herself set free from an arbitrary combination  by which she had been long kept in dependance  The Earl of Godolphin  the Duke s son in law  was divested of his office  and the treasury submitted to Harley  the antagonist of his ambition  Lord Somers was dismissed from being president of the council  and the Earl of Rochester appointed in his room  In a word  there was not one Whig left in any office of state  except the Duke of Marlborough  he retained his employments for a short time  unsupported and alone  an object of envy and factious reproach  till at length be found his cause irretrievable  and was obliged  after trying another campaign  to resign  as the rest of his party had done before   As war seemed to have been the desire of the Whig party
