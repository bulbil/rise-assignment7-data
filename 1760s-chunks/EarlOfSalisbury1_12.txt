threatened  to defeat it s own purpose  By his persuasion it was determined to act  with secrecy and caution  to wait until darkness might conceal their  motions  and to chuse the dead hour of midnight  to surprize my guards   and to snatch me from the cruel malice of my enemy  Eternal goodness   that directed their hearts  and guided their steps  be witness for me   with what gratitude I received my miraculous preservation  No longer the  helpless victim of fell revenge  no longer crouching under the ruthless  arm of a russian  I felt my afflictions no more  they vanished like a  frightful dream  which the chearful beams of morning had dissipated   And I now appeared as indeed a soldier  encompassed by a hardy band  in  the gay trim of war  to which the rising light gave new lustre  still  farther irritated by the black design of murder  loudly encouraging me  to rely on their protection  and to bid defiance to the ungenerous cruel  Count  Nor was this confidence slightly founded  for I learned that by  their revolt Mal leon was deprived of a force  which fully equalled all  that yet remained under his command                  SECT  V     THEY now marched on  publickly disclaiming all obedience but to their  chief Les Roches  not as intending hostilities  but determined to retire  from the island  and to demonstrate the sincerity of their declarations   the guards lately overpowered were already freed and courteously  dismissed  nor was even the surviving ruffian detained  Count Savour√®  could not look with unconcern at so alarming a defection in his troops   All his remaining force was instantly collected  and soon we were  confronted by a considerable body led by the proud Count  that stopped  our farther progress  and while each party drew up in formidable array   each was possessed with anxiety and expectation  On our side  a firm  resolution to support our purpose to the last  was unalterably fixed in  every heart  yet with humane concern and generous reluctance against  shedding the blood of countrymen  endeared by natural affection  and a  long social intercourse  The little armies stood for a while in a state  of sullen inaction lowering upon each other  a delay which seemed to  declare that neither presumed on any superiority  and that both  expected  and desired a parly  This was at length proposed by my friend   and readily accepted     The commanders on each side advanced with a few attendants  and first  Mal leon proudly demanded the reason of this appearance of disloyalty  and hostility  Les Roches repelled his accusation by recounting the  injuries that had been offered to his honour and independance  urged the  ungrateful returns made  to his free and faithful services  by a vile unprovoked imprisonment   and declared that his sole purpose was to withdraw his arms from a Lord   who had loaded him with wrongs and disgrace  To this the Count replied   that the present appearance discovered clearly the necessity and the  justice of his late conduct  that it now plainly appeared  that Les  Roches had united with his enemy and the enemy of his country  to tear  the island from him  and that far from having oppressed or injured him   nothing but his own mistaken lenity had enabled a false Frenchman to  proceed in this traiterous design  For this had he rescued from him the  man who had basely stolen upon his territory  to corrupt his  dependants  and to arm them against their Lord  for this he had murdered  his officer  who gallantly opposed his unjust attempt  and for this he  now stood in arms  ready to sacrifice his kinsmen and countrymen to the  treacherous purpose of an Englishman  who did not dare to meet him  bravely in the field  but laboured to destroy him by the secret  practices of fraud and circumvention     To this my friend answered with a generous warmth  That as my soul was  incapable of a base design  so my manner of coming into the island  plainly removed all suspicions of any attempt against his government   that  cast as I was upon his shore  helpless and unattended by any  numbers that could create the least fear  my endeavours had solely been  exerted to elude his search  and to regain my native country  that all  his own offence had been an endeavour  tho  fruitless  to favour the  secret retreat of a noble enemy to whom he owed his life and liberty   nor could he repent of his grateful efforts  when no ransom was to be  accepted  no captivity or restraint was deemed sufficiently severe  for  a noble  generous  and unhappy Lord  when the ruffian had been hired to  shed his blood  and in the dead hour of night dared to lift the  murderous dagger against his unoffending  unsuspecting innocence       Suspicion  grief and indignation now raised a confused murmur among the  attendants of Mal leon  the same
