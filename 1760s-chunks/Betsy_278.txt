 Mi da l ardir amor        The attention Mrs  Munden gave to the musick  preventing her from   speaking  the mercer said he was sorry she was obliged to wait so long     I rather ought to thank you  Sir  for detaining me  since I have an   entertainment more elegant than I could have expected elsewhere         The lady sings and plays well indeed  Madam   said he   she is a   customer of mine  and sometimes does my wife the favour of passing an   hour with her        The lady still continued playing  and Mrs  Munden expressing a more than   ordinary pleasure in hearing her  the complaisant mercer asked her to   walk into the parlour  to which she replied  she would gladly accept his   offer  provided it would be no intrusion  he assured her it would not be   accounted so in the least  and with these words conducted her into the   room       A few words served to introduce her to his wife  who being a very   genteel  pretty sort of woman  received her with great civility  but   the fair musician was no sooner told the effects her accents had   produced on Mrs  Munden  than  though she was a foreigner  and spoke   very broken English  she returned the compliment made her by that lady   on the occasion  in a manner so perfectly free  and withal so noble  as   discovered her to have been bred among  and accustomed to converse with    persons in the highest stations in life       Vain as Mrs  Munden was of her perfections  she was always ready to   acknowledge and admire those she found in others of her sex  There was   something in this lady  that attracted her in a peculiar manner  she   took as much delight in hearing her talk  as she had done in hearing her   sing  she longed to be of the number of her acquaintance  and made her   several overtures that way  which the other either did not  or would   not  seem to understand       The mercer s man returning with the silks his master had mentioned  Mrs    Munden thought  after the obliging entertainment she had received  she   could do no less than become a purchaser of something  accordingly she   bought a piece of silk for a night gown  though at the time she had not   the least occasion for it  nor  on her coming into the shop  had any   intention to increase her wardrobe       Having now no longer a pretence to stay  she gave the mercer directions   where to send home the silk  and then took her leave  but could not do   it without telling the lady  that she should think herself extremely   happy in having the opportunity of a much longer conversation with her       On her speaking in this manner  the other appeared in very great   confusion  but having  after a pretty long pause  a little recovered   herself   It is an honour  Madam   said she   I would be extremely   ambitious of  and had certainly taken the liberty to request it of you    if there were not a cruel peculiarity in my fate  which deprives me of   all hopes of that  and many other blessings  I could wish to enjoy        Mrs  Munden was so much surprized at these words  that she could only   reply  she was sorry a lady  who appeared so deserving  should be denied   any thing she thought worthy of desiring       It might well  indeed  seem a little strange that a lady so young    beautiful  and accomplished  should have any motive to induce her to   speak in the terms she had done  Mrs  Munden had a good deal of   curiosity in her composition  she thought there was something   extraordinarily mysterious in the circumstances of this stranger  and   was very desirous of penetrating into the secret       About an hour after she came home  the mercer s man brought the silk    she enquired of him the name  condition  and place of abode  of the   young lady she had seen at his master s  but received not the least   information from him as to any of the questions she had put to him  He   told her  that though she often bought things at their shop  yet his   master always carried them home himself  and he was entirely ignorant of   every thing relating to her       This a little vexed her  because she doubted not but that  if she once   found out her name
