stay in the country    but Sir Ralph and Lady Trusty would not consent to his departure  and   all he could obtain from them was  permission to send back his coach    with one servant to take care of the horses       No proposals having yet been made concerning a settlement for Mrs    Munden  by way of dowry  Mr  Trueworth took Sir Ralph aside the next   morning  and desired he would send for a lawyer  which he immediately   did  a gentleman of that profession happening to live very near  and  on   his coming  received such instructions from Mr  Trueworth for drawing up   the writings  as convinced Sir Ralph both of the greatness of his   generosity  and the sincerity of his love  to the lady he was about to   make his wife       Expedition having been recommended to the lawyer  he returned soon   after dinner with an instrument drawn up in so judicious a manner    that it required not the least alteration  While Sir Ralph and Mr    Trueworth were locked up with him in order to examine it  Mrs    Munden received no inconsiderable addition to the present satisfaction   of her mind by the arrival of her brother Frank  After the first   welcome being given   You are come  captain   said Lady Trusty   just   time enough to be a witness of your sister s marriage  which is to be   celebrated to morrow     Marriage   cried he   and without acquainting   either of her brothers with her intentions  But I hope   continued he     it is not to disadvantage  as your ladyship seems not displeased at   it     I assure you  captain   resumed Lady Trusty   I knew nothing of   the affair till yesterday  nor had ever seen before the gentleman your   sister has made choice of  but love and destiny   added she   are not to   be resisted   These words  and the serious air she assumed in speaking   them  giving him cause to fear his sister was going to throw herself   away  he shook his head  and seemed in a good deal of uneasiness  but   had not an opportunity to testify what he felt any otherwise than by his   looks  Sir Ralph and Mr  Trueworth in that instant entering the room    The extreme surprize he was in at the sight of the latter  was such as   prevented him from paying his respects to either in the manner he would   have done if more master of himself  but Mr  Trueworth  guessing the   emotions of his mind  locked him in his arms  saying   Dear Frank  I   shall at last be so happy as to call you brother     Heavens  is it   possible   cried he   Am I awake  or is this illusion   Then running to   Mrs  Munden   Sister   said he   is what I hear a real fact  Are you    indeed  to be married to Mr  Trueworth     You hear I am   answered she    smiling   and hear it from a mouth not accustomed to deceit   He then   flew to Mr  Trueworth  crying   My dear  dear Trueworth  I little hoped   this honour   Then  turning to Lady Trusty   Oh  Madam   said he   how   agreeably have you deceived me     I knew it would be so   replied she     but I told you nothing but the truth        The extravagance of the young captain s joy being a little over  Mr    Trueworth presented Mrs  Munden with the parchment he had received from   the lawyer   What is this   demanded she   Take it  take it   cried Sir   Ralph   it is no less than a settlement of eight hundred pounds a year   on you in case of accidents     I accept it  Sir   said Mrs  Munden to   Mr  Trueworth   as a fresh proof of your affection  but Heaven forbid I   should ever live to receive any other advantage from it   He kissed her   hand with the most tender transports on these obliging words  after   which they all seated themselves  and never was there a joy more perfect   and sincere than what each of these worthy company gave demonstrations   of in their respective characters  The next morning compleated the   wishes of the enamoured pair  and the satisfaction of their friends       An account of this event was dispatched the next post to all who had any   welfare in the interest of the new wedded lovers  Mr  Thoughtless
