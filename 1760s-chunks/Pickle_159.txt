priest  had defrauded him of his  money  He denounced vengeance against the mendicant  whom he swore he  would destroy if ever he should set eyes on him again   The painter unluckily appearing during this paroxysm of rage  he seized  him by the throat  saying he was ruined by his accursed folly  and in  all likelihood poor Pallet would have been strangled had not Jolter  interposed in his behalf  beseeching his pupil to have mercy upon the  sufferer  and  with infinite anxiety  desiring to know the cause of  this violent assault  He received no answer but a string of incoherent  curses  When the painter  with unspeakable astonishment  took God to  witness that he had done nothing to disoblige him  the governor began to  think  in sad earnest  that Peregrine s vivacity had at length risen to  the transports of actual madness  and was himself almost distracted with  this supposition  That he might the better judge what remedy ought to  be applied  he used his whole influence  and practised all his eloquence  upon the youth  in order to learn the immediate cause of his delirium   He employed the most pathetic entreaties  and even shed tears in the  course of his supplication  so that Pickle  the first violence of the  hurricane being blown over  was ashamed of his own imprudence  and  retired to his chamber in order to recollect his dissipated thoughts   there he shut himself up  and for the second time perusing the fatal    6 22 15  3 45 PM   epistle  began to waver in his opinion of the author s character and  intention  He sometimes considered her as one of those nymphs  who   under the mask of innocence and simplicity  practise upon the hearts and  purses of unwary and inexperienced youths  this was the suggestion of  his wrath inflamed by disappointment  but when he reflected upon the  circumstances of her behaviour  and recalled her particular charms to  his imagination  the severity of his censure gave way and his heart  declared in favour of her sincerity   Yet even this consideration aggravated the sense of his loss  and he was  in danger of relapsing into his former distraction  when his passion was  a little becalmed by the hope of seeing her again  either by accident  or in the course of a diligent and minute inquiry  which he forthwith  resolved to set on foot  He had reason to believe that her own heart  would espouse his cause in spite of her virtue s determination  and did  not despair of meeting with the Capuchin  whose good offices he knew he  could at any time command  Comforted with these reflections  the tempest  of his soul subsided  In less than two hours he joined his company with  an air of composure  and asked the painter s forgiveness for the freedom  he had taken  the cause of which he promised hereafter to explain   Pallet was glad of being reconciled on any terms to one whose  countenance supported him in equilibrio with his antagonist the doctor   and Mr  Jolter was rejoiced beyond measure at his pupil s recovery   CHAPTER LIX    Peregrine meets with Mrs  Hornbeck  and is consoled for his Loss  His  Valet de chambre is embroiled with her Duenna  whom  however  he finds  means to appease   Everything having thus resumed its natural channel  they dined together  in great tranquility  In the afternoon  Peregrine  on pretence of  staying at home to write letters  while his companions were at  the coffee house  ordered a coach to be called  and  with his  valet de chambre  who was the only person acquainted with the present  state of his thoughts  set out for the promenade  to which all the  ladies of fashion resort in the evening during the summer season  in  hopes of seeing his fugitive among the rest   Having made a circuit round the walk  and narrowly observed every female  in the place  he perceived at some distance the livery of Hornbeck upon  a lacquey that stood at the back of a coach  upon which he ordered his  man to reconnoitre the said carriage  while he pulled up his glasses   that he might not be discovered before he should have received some  intelligence by which he might conduct himself on this unexpected  occasion  that already began to interfere with the purpose of his coming  thither  though it could not dispute his attention with the idea of his  charming unknown   His Mercury  having made his observations  reported that there was  nobody in the coach but Mrs  Hornbeck and an elderly woman  who had all  the air of a duenna  and that the servant was not the same footman who    6 22 15  3 45 PM   had attended them in France  Encouraged by this information  our hero  ordered himself to be driven close up to that side of their convenience  on which his old mistress sat  and accosted her with the usual  salutation  This lady no sooner beheld her gallant than her cheeks  reddened with a double
