of it to themselves  had this happy influence over the   rest of the ship s company  that it kept them  if not easy  at least   quiet  from aU murmurings and complaints of bad provisions    short weights  and such like imaginary grievances  which the   restless temper of seamen is too apt to make the cause of much   trouble to the purser  and disturbance to the captain  when these   happen not to agree between themselves  But  as the contrary   was the case here  their common interest animated the assiduity   of my master  and made him go directly to the several officers and   contractors with whom his business lay  to prepare everything in   proper order for public inspection      On my first going to these public offices  everything gave me   pleasure  There was such an appearance of regularity in all the   proceedings  of ease and affluence in the officers  that I could not   help saying to myself    Happy state  whose meanest servants are   gentlemen   whose business is reduced to a system  above danger   of confusion or abuse   But a nearer view showed things in   another Ught  The first person my master went to was the   gentleman who supplied him with those kinds of clothing for the   seamen  which are by these merry poor fellows emphatically   caUed slops  As he was just going to dinner  my master accepted   of his invitation  and sat down with him  A round or two of   loyal toasts to the success of the navy  and continuance of the   war  having washed down their fare  and refreshed their spirits   after the fatigue of a full meal  they proceeded to business        I come  sir    said my master    to settle the account of the last   cruise  Here it is  You see most of the articles have pone off   pretty well  but I must tell you  that you are more obUged to   some of your friends for that than you are aware of perhaps   for   if I had not prevailed on the captain to let the alehouse  keepers   and gin women come on board  and keep the slop sellers off  when   the men received their pay  on going out  you would have had   but a blank list of it  But by this management the fellows spent   all their money in drink  and then necessity drove them to me   for clothes          Here is to the captain s good health    answered the other  â€¢ and   that I may soon see him at the head of the navy  I am very much   obliged to you and him  and shall consider your friendship   properly  But is there no way of preventing those pedlars from   intruding thus upon us   I am resolved I will try  I believe I can   make an interest  you understand me  that will procure me an   order to exclude them   at least  if I cannot do that  I will insist   on raising my terms  for every branch of business is now so   loaded with presents and perquisites  that there is scarce anything   to be got  A man who goes to a public office to receive money         32 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     runs the gauntlet through bo many of them  that  if he does nofc   make up his accounts in a very masterly manner indeed  he will   have but little to show for his pains  in the end          Very true    replied my master    I have had experience of   what you say this very morning  You know it is some years since    I have been in town before   I was therefore quite surprised at   the gay appearance of every clerk in the offices  Our midshipmen   on the paying off of a ship are nothing to them   so  thought I to   myself  this is very well   Such fine gentlemen as these will never   stoop to take the little perquisites which their shabby predecessors   were so eager for   they cannot want them  Accordingly  as soon   as I had done my business  I was preparing to make a handsome   speech  and a leg  and so walk oS  but I was soon undeceived    and found  to my no small astonishment  that  if the case wa    altered  it was no way for the better for me   the present fine    gentlemen being to the full as rapacious as the former shabby   fellows   and with this addition to the evil  that their expectations   were raised in proportion to their appearance
