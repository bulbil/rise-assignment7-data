 In this state of half refinement  the Saxons were at the time in which the Britons were thus distressed  This virtuous and warlike people had conquered wherever they came  and to them the wretched remains of this forlorn people had recourse for protection   As the conquest of this island is generally imputed to the Saxons as a piece of treachery  and an invasion of those rights they were only called to protect  I shall give the invitation they received   31 from the Britons  as it hath been left us by Wittichindus  a cotemporary historian of credit  and from hence it may be judged  what little right the Britons had afterwards to complain     The poor and distressed Britons  almost worn out by hostile invasions  and harrassed by continual incursions  are humble suppliants to you  most valiant Saxons  for succour  We are possessed of a wide  extended  and a fertile country  this we yield wholly to be at your devotion and command  Beneath the wing of your valour  we seek for safety  and shall willingly undergo whatever services you may hereafter be pleased to impose      The Saxons were one branch of those Gothic nations  which  swarming from the northern hive  came to give laws and liberty to the rest of Europe  A branch of these  under the name of Suevi  had  some time before Caesar s invasion of Gaul  subdued and possessed an extensive empire in Germany  These  for their strength and valour  were grown formidable to all the German nations  The Suevi were reckoned  by their neighbours  a people for whom the very immortal Gods were not a match in war  They were after divided into several nations  and each became famous for subduing the country which it invaded  France  Germany  and England  were among the number of their conquests   The Saxons were far more polished than the ancient inhabitants of Britain  tho  their acquirements were much inferior to the boasted refinements of Rome  They dressed with some degree of elegance  a luxury which was unknown to the Britons  the women used linen garments  trimmed and striped with purple  their hair was bound in   32 wreaths  or fell in curls upon their shoulders  their arms were bare  and their bosoms uncovered  Fashions which  in some measure  seem peculiar to the ladies of Britain to this day  Their governments were entirely elective  and nearly republican  their commanders were chosen by merit  and dismissed from duty when their authority was no longer needful  The custom of trying by twelve men is of Saxon original  slavery  and base submissioin  was unknown among them  and they preferred death to a shameful existence  We 〈…〉  by Marcellinus  that a body of them being taken prisoners by Symmachus  the Roman  he designed to exhibit them  in the amphitheatre  as gladiators  for the entertainment of the citizens of Rome  The morning  however  on which they were expected to perform  they were every one found dead in his prison  each chusing rather a voluntary death  than to be the ignominious instruments of brutal satisfaction to their conquerors  The chastity of this people is equally remarkable  and to be without children was to be without praise  but  in war  they chiefly excelled  they had  in some measure  learned discipline from the Romans  whom they had often conquered  it was their maxim to esteem fortune as a doubtful advantage  but courage as a certain good  A nation  however  entirely addicted to war  must  consequently  be addicted to cruelty  and those terrors  which a man is taught not to fear himself  he is seldom afraid of inflicting on society  The Saxons are represented as a cruel nation  but their enemies alone have drawn the picture   Vortigern  who had been elected King of the distressed Britons  easily induced these conquerors to lend him assistance  They came over into Britain   33 in great numbers  commanded by Hengist and Horsa  of the race of Odin  They marched against the Picts  and  in conjunction with the British arms  defeated them in several encounters  obliging them to retreat into the most northern parts of the province  The Saxons  thus finding themselves evidently the most powerful people upon the island  seemed resolved to reward themselves with those parts of it which were most to their liking  They first obtained consent from the Britons to send over for more forces  under a pretence of guarding their frontier  These seated themselves in the northern provinces  and repressed the incursions of the Picts and Scots with great bravery and success  Those nations were  therefore  obliged to bound their territories with the rough and mountainous countries that lie between the two seas  and such have  ever since  continued the boundaries of England and Scotland   The province thus secured from the common enemy  dissensions began to arise between the Britons and their new allies  The Saxons valued too highly the assistance they had given  and the Britons  perhaps  under rated what they had received  In a contest of this nature  it is natural to imagine  that the stronger nation alwas imposes laws on the weaker  The Saxons  allured by the
