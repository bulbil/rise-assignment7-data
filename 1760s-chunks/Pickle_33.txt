   Trunnion was overjoyed at the receipt of this letter  which he looked  upon as one of the greatest efforts of human genius  and as such  communicated the contents to his lady  whom he had disturbed for the  purpose in the middle of her devotion  by sending a message to her  closet  whither it was her custom very frequently to retire  She was  out of humour at being interrupted  and therefore did not peruse this  specimen of her nephew s understanding with all the relish that the  commodore himself had enjoyed  on the contrary  after sundry paralytical  endeavours to speak  for her tongue sometimes refused its office   she  observed that the boy was a pert jackanapes  and deserved to be severely  chastised for treating his betters with such disrespect  Her husband    6 22 15  3 45 PM   undertook his godson s defence  representing with great warmth that he  knew Keypstick to be a good for nothing pimping old rascal  and that  Perry showed a great deal of spirit and good sense in desiring to be  taken from under his command  he therefore declared that the boy  should not live a week longer with such a shambling son of a b    and  sanctioned this declaration with abundance of oaths   Mrs  Trunnion  composing her countenance into a look of religions  demureness  rebuked him for his profane way of talking  and asked  in  a magisterial tone  if he intended never to lay aside that brutal  behaviour  Irritated at this reproach  he answered  in terms of  indignation  that he knew how to behave himself as well as e er a woman  that wore a head  bade her mind her affairs  and with another repetition  of oaths gave her to understand that he would be master in his own  house   The insinuation operated upon her spirits like friction upon a glass  globe  her face gleamed with resentment  and every pore seemed to emit  particles of flame  She replied with incredible fluency of the bitterest  expressions  he retorted equal rage in broken hints and incoherent  imprecations  she rejoined with redoubled fury  and in conclusion he was  fain to betake himself to flight  ejaculating curses against her  and  muttering something concerning the brandy bottle  which  however  he  took care should never reach her ears   From his own house he went directly to visit Mrs  Pickle  to whom  he imparted Peregrine s epistle  with many encomiums upon the boy s  promising parts  and  finding his commendations but coolly received   desired she would permit him to take his godson under his own care   This lady  whose family was now increased by another son  who seemed to  engross her care for the present  had not seen Perry during a course  of four years  and  with regard to him  was perfectly weaned of  that infirmity known by the name of maternal fondness  she therefore  consented to the commodore s request with great condescension  and a  polite compliment to him on the concern he had all along manifested for  the welfare of the child   CHAPTER XIII   The Commodore takes Peregrine under his own care  The Boy arrives at  the Garrison  Is strangely received by his own Mother  Enters into a  Confederacy with Hatchway and Pipes  and executes a couple of waggish  Enterprises upon his Aunt   Trunnion having obtained this permission  that very afternoon despatched  the lieutenant in a post chaise to Keypstick s house  from whence in two  days he returned with our young hero  who being now in the eleventh  year of his age  had outgrown the expectation of all his family  and was  remarkable for the beauty and elegance of his person  His godfather was  transported at his arrival  as if he had been actually the issue of  his own loins  he shook him heartily by the hand  turned him round and    6 22 15  3 45 PM   round  surveyed him from top to bottom  bade Hatchway take notice how  handsomely he was built  and squeezed his hand again  saying    D   ye   you dog  I suppose you don t value such an old crazy son of a b   as me  a rope s end  You have forgot how I was wont to dandle you on my knee   when you was a little urchin no bigger than a davit  and played a  thousand tricks upon me  burning my  bacco pouches and poisoning my  rumbo  O  d   ye  you can grin fast enough I see  I warrant you have  learnt more things than writing and the Latin lingo    Even Tom Pipes expressed uncommon satisfaction on this joyful occasion   and  coming up to Perry  thrust forth his fore paw  and accosted him  with the salutation of  What cheer  my young master  I am glad to see  thee with all my heart   These compliments being passed  his uncle  halted to the door of his wife s chamber  at which he
