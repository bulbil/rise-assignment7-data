the care of Providence  and pursue the traitors to the farthest extremities of the earth  He practised a much more easy  certain  and effectual method of revenge  by instituting a process against them  which  after writs of capias  alias et pluries  had been repeated  subjected them both to outlawry  Mr  Sycamore  and his friend  being thus deprived of the benefit of the law by their own neglect  would likewise have forfeited their goods and chattels to the King  had not they made such submissions as appeased the wrath of Sir Launcelot and Captain Crowe  then they ventured to return  and  by dint of interest  obtained a reversal of the outlawry  But this grace they did not enjoy till long after our adventurer was happily established in life   While the knight waited impatiently for the expiration of Aurelia s minority  and in the meantime consoled himself with the imperfect happiness arising from her conversation  and those indulgences which the most unblemished virtue could bestow  Captain Crowe projected another plan of vengeance against the conjurer  whose lying oracles had cost him such a world of vexation  The truth is  the captain began to be tired of idleness  and undertook this adventure to keep his hand in use  He imparted his design to Crabshaw  who had likewise suffered in spirit from the predictions of the said offender  and was extremely well disposed to assist in punishing the false prophet  He now took it for granted that he should not be hanged for stealing a horse  and thought it very hard to pay so much money for a deceitful prophecy  which  in all likelihood  would never be fulfilled   Actuated by these motives  they set out together for the house of consultation  but they found it shut up and abandoned  and  upon inquiry in the neighbourhood  learned that the conjurer had moved his quarters that very day on which the captain had recourse to his art  This was actually the case  He knew the fate of Sir Launcelot would soon come to light  and he did not choose to wait the consequence  He had other motives for decamping  He had run a score at the public house  which he had no mind to discharge  and wanted to disengage himself from his female associate  who knew too much of his affairs to be kept at a proper distance  All these purposes he had answered by retreating softly  without beat of drum  while his sibyl was abroad running down prey for his devouring  He had not  however  taken his measures so cunningly  but that this old hag discovered his new lodgings  and  in revenge  gave information to the publican  This creditor took out a writ accordingly  and the bailiff had just secured his person  as Captain Crowe and Timothy Crabshaw chanced to pass by the door in their way homewards  through an obscure street  near the Seven Dials   The conjurer having no subterfuge left  but a great many particular reasons for avoiding an explanation with the justice  like the man between the devil and the deep sea  of two evils chose the least  and beckoning to the captain  called him by his name  Crowe  thus addressed  replied with a  Hilloah   and looking towards the place from whence he was hailed  at once recognised the necromancer  Without farther hesitation  he sprang across the street  and  collaring Albumazar  exclaimed   Aha  old boy  is the wind in that corner  I thought we should grapple one day—now will I bring you up by the head  though all the devils in hell were blowing abaft the beam    The bailiff seeing his prisoner so roughly handled before  and at the same time assaulted behind by Crabshaw  who cried   Show me a liar  and I ll show you a thief—who is to be hanged now   I say  the bailiff  fearing he should lose the benefit of his job  began to put on his contentious face  and  declaring the doctor was his prisoner  swore he could not surrender him without a warrant from the Lord Chief Justice  The whole group adjourning into the parlour  the conjurer desired to know of Crowe whether Sir Launcelot was found  Being answered   Ey  ey  safe enough to see you made fast in the bilboes  brother   he told the captain he had something of consequence to communicate for his advantage  and proposed that Crowe and Crabshaw should bail the action  which lay only for a debt of three pounds   Crowe stormed  and Crabshaw grinned at this modest proposal  but when they understood that they could only be bound for his appearance  and reflected that they need not part with him until his body should be surrendered unto justice  they consented to give bail  and the bond being executed  conveyed him directly to the house of our adventurer   The boisterous Crowe introduced him to Sir Launcelot with such an abrupt unconnected detail of his offence  as the knight could not understand without Timothy s annotations  These were followed by some questions put to the conjurer  who  laying aside his black gown  and plucking off his white beard  exhibited to the astonished spectators the very individual countenance of the empirical politician Ferret  who had
