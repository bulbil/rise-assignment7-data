prisoners at discretion  The Pretender  being returned to Scotland  proceeded to Glasgow  from which city he exacted severe contributions  Advancing to Stirling  he was joined by Lord Lewis Gordon  at the head of some forces which had been   180 assembled in his absence  Other Clans  to the number of two thousand  came in likewise  Spain sent him some supplies of money  and  in one or two skirmishes with the loyalists  his Generals came off with victory  so that his affairs once more seemed to wear an aspect of success  Being joined by John Lord Drummond  he invested the castle of Stirling  commanded by General Blakeney  but his forces being unused to sieges  consumed much time to no purpose  General Hawley  who commanded a considerable body of forces near Edinburgh  undertook to raise the siege  He advanced towards the rebel army  and rendezvoused his whole force at Falkirk  while the rebels lay incamped at no great distance  After two days  mutually examining each other s strength  the rebels  on the seventeenth day of January  came on in full spirits to attack the King s army  The Pretender  who stood in the front line  gave the signal to fire  and the first volley served to put Hawley s forces into confusion  The horse retreated with precipitation  and fell in upon their own infantry  the rebels followed their blow  and the greatest part of the royal army fled with the utmost precipitation  They retired in confusion to Edinburgh  leaving the field of battle  with part of their tents and artillery  to the rebels   This was the end of all their triumphs  A new scene of conduct was now going to open  for the Duke of Cumberland  at that time the favourite of the English army  had put himself at the head of the troops at Edinburgh  which consisted of about fourteen thousand men  He resolved therefore to come to a battle as soon as possible  and marched forward  while the young adventurer retired at his approach  The Duke advanced to Aberdeen  where he was joined by the Duke of Gordon  and some other Lords  attached to his family and cause  After having refreshed his troops here for some time  he renewed   181 his march  and  in twelve days  came upon the banks of the deep and rapid river Spey  This was a place where the rebels might have disputed his passage  but they seemed now totally void of all counsel and subordination  without conduct  and without expectation  The Duke still proceeded in his pursuit  and  at length  had advice that the enemy had advanced from Inverness to the Plain of Culloden  which was about nine miles distant  and there intended to give him battle  On this Plain the Highlanders were drawn up in order of battle  to the number of eight thousand men  in thirteen divisions  supplied with some pieces of artillery  The battle began about one o clock in the afternoon  the canon of the King s army did dreadful execution among the enemy  while theirs  being but ill served  was ineffectual  One of the great errors in all the Pretender s warlike measures  was his subjecting undisciplined troops to the forms of artful war  and thus repressing their native ferocity  from which alone he could hope for success  After they had stood the English fire for some time  they  at length  became impatient for closer engagement  and about five hundred of them attacked the English left wing  with their accustomed fierceness  The first line being disordered by this onset  two battalions advanced to support it  and galled the enemy by a terrible and close discharge  At the same time the dragoons under Hawley  and the Argyleshire militia  pulling down a park wall that guarded the enemy s flank  and which the rebels had left but feebly defended  fell in among them  sword in hand  with great slaughter  In less than thirty minutes they were totally routed  and the field covered with their wounded and slain  to the number of above three thousand men  Civil war is in itself terrible  but still more so when heightened by cruelty  How guilty soever men may be  it is ever the business of a soldier to remember    182 that he is only to fight an enemy that opposes him  and to spare the supplicant  This victory was in every respect complete  and humanity to the conquered would even have made it glorious  The conquerors often refused mercy to wretches who were defenceless or wounded  and soldiers were seen to anticipate the base employment of the executioner   Thus sunk all the hopes  and the ambition of the young adventurer  one short hour deprived him of imaginary thrones and sceptres  and reduced him from a nominal King to a distressed forlorn out cast  shunned by all mankind  except such as sought to take his life  To the good natured  subsequent distress often atones for former guilt  and while reason would repress humanity  yet our hearts plead in the favour of the wretched  The Duke  immediately after the decisive action at Culloden  ordered six and thirty deserters to be executed  the conquerors spread terror wherever they came  and  after a short time  the
