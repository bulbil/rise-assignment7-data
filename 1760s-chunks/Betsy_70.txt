   Lady Mellasin  to what her daughter had said  added many obliging   things  in order to prevail on him either to return  or renew his visits   hereafter  but the captain was obstinate  and  persisting in his   resolution of coming there no more  took his leave  and Miss Flora lost   all hope of receiving any benefit from his being rejected by Miss   Betsy                CHAPTER XIX       Will make the reader little the wiser          The greatest part of the time that Mr  Trueworth and Mr  Staple staid   with Miss Betsy  was taken up with talking of Captain Hysom  his   passion  his behaviour  and the manner in which he received his   dismission  afforded  indeed  an ample field for conversation  Lady   Mellasin and Miss Flora  relating the answers he had given them on their   pressing him to come back  Mr  Trueworth said  that it must be owned    that he had shewn a strength of resolution which few men in love could   boast of        Love  Sir  according to my notions of that passion   replied Mr    Staple   is not one to be felt by every heart  many deceive themselves   in this point  and take for it what is in reality no more than a bare   liking of a beautiful object  the captain seems to me to have a soul  as   well as form  cast in too rough a mould to be capable of those refined   and delicate ideas  which alone constitute and are worthy to be called   love         Yet   said Lady Mellasin   I have heard Mr  Goodman give him an   excellent character  and  above all  that he is one of the best natured   men breathing     That may be  indeed  Madam   resumed Mr  Staple   and   some allowances ought to be made for the manner in which he has been   bred  though   added he   I have known many commanders  not only of   Indiamen  but of other trading vessels  who have all their life time   used the sea  yet have known how to behave with politeness enough when   on shore        Mr  Trueworth agreed with Mr  Staple  that though the amorous   declarations of a person of the captain s age  and fashion of bringing   up  to one of Miss Betsy s  exposed him to the deserved ridicule of as   many as knew it  yet ought not his particular foible to be any   reflection on his occupation  which merited to be held in the greatest   veneration  as the strength and opulence of the nation was owing to its   commerce in foreign parts       This was highly obliging to Mr  Staple  whose father had been a   merchant  and Mr  Trueworth being the first who took his leave    perceiving the other staid supper  he said abundance of handsome things   in his praise  and seemed to have conceived so high esteem of him  that   Miss Betsy was diverted in her mind to think how he would change his way   of speaking  when once the secret of his rivalship should come out  as   she knew it could not fail to do in a short time       But as easy as Mr  Staple was at present on this occasion  Mr  Trueworth   was no less anxious and perplexed  he was convinced that the other   visited Miss Betsy on no other score than that of love  and it appeared   to him equally certain  by the freedom with which he saw him treated by   the family  that he was likewise greatly encouraged  if not by Miss   Betsy herself  at least by her guardian       His thoughts were now wholly taken up with the means by which he might   gain the advantage over a rival  whom he looked upon as a formidable   one  not only for his personal accomplishments  but also for his having   the good fortune to address her before himself  All he could do was to   prevent  as much as possible  all opportunities of his entertaining Miss   Betsy in private  till the arrival of Mr  Francis Thoughtless  from   whose friendship  and the influence he had over his sister  he hoped   much       He waited on her the next day very early  Mr  Goodman happening to dine   that day later than ordinary  on account of some friends he had with   him  and the cloth not being drawn  Miss Betsy went and received him in   another room  Having this favourable opportunity  he
