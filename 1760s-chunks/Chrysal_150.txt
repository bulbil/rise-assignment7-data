think it easier   to buy than earn honour by merit  An Irish title was the constant   refuge of those sons of fortune who  not being bom in the rank of   gentlemen  or having forfeited it by their villanies  were desirous of   changing their names for sonorous titles  to hide their disgrace  as it   were  under an heap of honours  which  in reality only make them   the more exposed to the view  and consequently to the censure of   the world  But I find even that imaginary sense of honour is gone   out of fashion  and the shadow is in no more request than the sub    stance at present  But since they are grown such a drug  even   make the most you can of them   sell them to whoever wiU buy     I shall take no exceptions to persons          I shall certainly do the best I can for your grace  though they   have been so oddly given away of late  that I verily believe people   are ashamed of taking them  for fear of being laughed at  Rattles   are given to children  but titles to old men  to divert them   to some    in reward for not doing the very worst possibly in their power  and   to others  for doing nothing at all  But pray  has your grace   seen the old colonel yet   He got his commission yesterday   I   wish he may mean your grace fairly          Why   Sure you do not imagine he can have the assurance to   think of plajdng me a trick           I do not positively say so  but his behaviour has been very   mysterious        Just then a servant let her grace know that the very colonel of   whom they were talking desired leave to wait upon her        I thought so    said she    show him up   I thought he would not   dare to trifle with me           ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 161         CHAPTER L     THE COLONEL PUTS THE OLD SOLDIEE trPON HEB GEACE HEK EAGE   AND RESENTMENT PALL TTPON HEB AGENT â€” HEB JTTDICIOirS AP    PLICATION OE THE bishop s CHAEITY  WITH HEB TENDEE CONOEEN   FOB HEB EBIENDS ABBOAD     The colonel advanced to her grace â  with the assurance of conscious   virtue sparkling in hia eye  though sharpened by a oast of indigna    tion    I come    said he    please your grace  to return you my   thanks for your favours   I have got my commission  and had the   honour  just now  to kiss his majesty s hand upon it  As your   recommendation was more efiectual to procure me this reward than   the labours of a life which has not been undistinguished in the   service  I thought it my duty to make your grace this acknowledg    ment  and to offer you any service in the power of an honest heart    and no bad hand in return          Colonel    repUed her grace    I am glad it has been in my power   to serve a man of your character  and I do not desire any such   return          I am much obliged to your grace for your good opinion    returned   he    which I hope I shall never forfeit  I thank God my character   will not disgrace your recommendation   nor shall you ever have   reason to blush at the mention of my name  I have the honour to   be your grace s most humble servant          But colonel    said the gentleman  the agent  who stood by      though her grace has no occasion for such a return as you offer    having no quarrels to be fought  there is a return of another nature   which you should not forget  especially as you promised it  too          Why  look you  sir    replied the colonel    as to that matter  it   is most certain that I did something like  promise some such thing     but when I have told the whole affair honestly to her grace  I am   sure she will be above demanding it          Sir    said her grace    I do not desire to hear anything more   about it   and I must tell you that you have behaved like an old   knave
