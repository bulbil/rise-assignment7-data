 and expressed their satisfaction in three  cheers  which were returned by the company within  as soon as they were  instructed in the nature of the salute by Trunnion  who  by this time   had entered into all the jollity of his new friends  and was indeed more  than half seas over  The lieutenant was introduced to all present as his  sworn brother  and had something tossed up for his dinner  Tom Pipes and  the crew were regaled in another room  and  a fresh pair of horses being  put to the coach  about six in the evening the commodore  with all his  attendants  departed for the garrison  after having shook hands with  every individual in the house   Without any further accident  he was conveyed in safety to his own  gate before nine  and committed to the care of Pipes  who carried him  instantly to his hammock  while the lieutenant was driven away to the  place where the bride and her friends remained in great anxiety   which vanished when he assured them that his commodore was safe  being  succeeded by abundance of mirth and pleasantry at the account he gave of  Trunnion s adventure   Another day was fixed for the nuptials  and in order to balk the  curiosity of idle people  which had given great offence  the parson was  prevailed upon to perform the ceremony in the garrison  which all  that day was adorned with flags and pendants displayed  and at night    6 22 15  3 45 PM   illuminated  by the direction of Hatchway  who also ordered the  patereroes to be fired  as soon as the marriage knot was tied  Neither  were the other parts of the entertainment neglected by this ingenious  contriver  who produced undeniable proofs of his elegance and art in  the wedding supper  which had been committed to his management and  direction  This genial banquet was entirely composed of sea dishes  a  huge pillaw  consisting of a large piece of beef sliced  a couple of  fowls  and half a peck of rice  smoked in the middle of the board  a  dish of hard fish  swimming in oil  appeared at each end  the sides  being furnished with a mess of that savoury composition known by the  name of lub s course  and a plate of salmagundy  The second course  displayed a goose of a monstrous magnitude  flanked with two  Guinea hens  a pig barbacued  a hock of salt pork  in the midst of  a pease pudding  a leg of mutton roasted  with potatoes  and another  boiled  with yams  The third service was made up of a loin of fresh  pork  with apple sauce  a kid smothered with onions  and a terrapin  baked in the shell  and last of all  a prodigious sea pie was presented   with an infinite volume of pancakes and fritters  That everything  might be answerable to the magnificence of this delicate feast  he had  provided vast quantifies of strong beer  flip  rumbo  and burnt brandy   with plenty of Barbadoes water for the ladies  and hired all the fiddles  within six miles  which  with the addition of a drum  bagpipe  and Welsh  harp  regaled the guests with a most melodious concert   The company  who were not at all exceptions  seemed extremely well  pleased with every particular of the entertainment  and the evening  being spent in the most social manner  the bride was by her sister  conducted to her apartment  where  however  a trifling circumstance had  like to have destroyed the harmony which had been hitherto maintained   I have already observed  that there was not one standing bed within the  walls  therefore the reader will not wonder that Mrs  Trunnion was out  of humour  when she found herself under the necessity of being confined  with her spouse in a hammock  which  though enlarged with a double  portion of canvas  and dilated with a yoke for the occasion  was at  best but a disagreeable  not to say dangerous situation  She accordingly  complained with some warmth of this inconvenience  which she imputed  to disrespect  and  at first  absolutely refused to put up with the  expedient  but Mrs  Pickle soon brought her to reason and compliance   by observing that one night will soon be elapsed  and next day she might  regulate her own economy   Thus persuaded  she ventured into the vehicle  and was visited by her  husband in less than an hour  the company being departed to their own  homes  and the garrison left to the command of his lieutenant and mate   But it seems the hooks that supported this swinging couch were not  calculated for the addition of weight which they were now destined to  bear  and therefore gave way in the middle of the night  to the no small  terror of Mrs  Trunnion  who perceiving herself falling  screamed aloud   and by that exclamation brought Hatchway with a light into the chamber   Though she had received no injury by the fall  she was extremely
