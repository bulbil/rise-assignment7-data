was abroad  asked who was above  and this question   occasioned the man  who was then dressing him  to give an account  as   far as was in his power to do  of the last night s accident       This a little surprized him  yet not enough to keep him from the Park    where he constantly walked every day an hour or two before dinner  but   on his return  he immediately interrogated his wife concerning her new   guest  on which she told him  without the least reserve  every   circumstance of this transaction  he listened attentively to what she   said  but testified neither any dislike or approbation of her conduct in   this respect  he said no more to her after she had done speaking  but   behaved with the same sullen silence he had always done since her   adventure with Lord       and as soon as dinner was over  went out to   pass the remainder of the day  and best part of the night  according to   custom       Mrs  Munden s good nature would not suffer her to go abroad the whole   afternoon  she passed all the hours  till bed time  with Mademoiselle   Roquelair  and did every thing in her power both to comfort her in the   affliction she was under  and to fortify her in the good resolution she   seemed to have taken  the next morning she received  as she expected    the following billet from her brother             To Mrs  Munden            Dear Sister            In compliance with your desires  and to be certain of getting        eternally rid of the sight of a woman who has so much abused the        kindness I had for her  I consent to grant her request of being        enabled to go into a monastery  a friend of mine has great dealings        with a merchant at Bologne  I will see him this afternoon  and pay        into his hands the sum which I am told is sufficient for that        purpose  If you give yourself the trouble to call on me to morrow        morning  I will give you his order for her receiving it on her        arrival  I cannot think of entering your house while she is in it         but am always  dear sister  your affectionate brother            T  THOUGHTLESS        Mrs  Munden having imparted the contents of this letter to Mademoiselle   de Roquelair  she seemed as much contented as a person in her   circumstances could be  she dined below that day  and Mr  Munden treated   her with the same politeness and complaisance he always used towards   persons over whom he had no power       The next morning did not fail of carrying his fair wife to her brother s   about the hour in which she imagined he would expect her  but on the   moment of her entrance  she had the mortification of being accosted by   him in these terms   My dear sister   said he   I was just going to send   to you  to prevent your giving yourself this needless trouble  The   gentleman I went to is out of town  and will not return these two days    so nothing can be done in this woman s affair till he comes back   She   told him she was extremely sorry   Because   said she   delays are   sometimes dangerous  but I hope  my dear brother  no second   considerations will make you frustrate the good intentions of this   unhappy penitent     No  no   cried he   I wish she may persevere in   them as steadfastly as I shall to the promise I have made   Satisfied   with this assurance  she made her leave  little suspecting  while she   was labouring with all her might in this good office  that cruel and   ungenerous return which was about to be made for her compassion       Mr  Munden had seen Mademoiselle de Roquelair no more than once  but   that once was sufficient to make him become enamoured  her beauty fired   him  the known wantonness of her inclinations encouraged him  he scarce   doubted of success  but in case of a failure  and if she should even   acquaint his wife with his attempt  her character furnished him with the   pretence of having made it only to try how far her conversion was   sincere
