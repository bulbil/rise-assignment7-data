the evening  Away went I on my errand  muttering to myself    So  so  now I have discovered the minister s infallible receipt for the cure of all evils  Faith and troth  he is in the right  and to all appearance he may draw as copiously as he pleases from the spring  without exhausting the source  I can easily guess what bag those pistoles come from  but after all  is it not the order of nature that the parent should nurture and maintain the child  The Count de Lemos  at our parting  said to me in a low voice    Farewell  my good and worthy friend  The Prince of Spain has a little hankering after the women  we must have a little conversation on that subject one of these days  I foresee that your agency will be very applicable on that head  I returned with my head full of this last hint  which it was impossible to misinterpret  Neither did I wish to do so  for it suited my talents to a nicety  What the devil is to happen next  said I  Behold me on the point of becoming pimp to the heir of the monarchy  Whether pimping was a virtue or a vice  I did not stop to inquire  the coarse surtout of morality would have worn but shabbily while the passions of so exalted a gallant were in the glare and glow of all their newest gloss  What a promotion for me to be the provider of pleasure to a great prince  Fair and softly  Master Gil Blas  some one may say  after all  you will be but second minister  May be so  but at bottom the honour of both these posts is equal  the difference lies in the profit only   While executing these honourable commissions  and getting forward daily in the good graces of the prime minister  what a happy being should I have been  if statesmen were born with a set of intestines to turn the chameleon s diet into chyle  It was more than two months since I had got rid of my grand lodging  and had taken up my quarters in a little room scarcely good enough for a banker s clerk  Though this was not quite as it should be  yet since I went out betimes in the morning  and never returned at night before bed time  there was not much to quarrel about on that score  All day I was the hero of my own stage  or rather of the duke s  It was a principal part that I was playing  But when I retired from this brilliant theatre to my own cockloft  the great lord vanished  and poor Gil Blas was left behind  without a royal image in his pocket  and what was worse  without the means of conjuring up his glorious resemblance  Besides that it would have wounded my pride to have divulged my necessities  there was not a creature of my acquaintance who could have assisted me but Navarro  and him I had too palpably neglected since my introduction at court  to venture on soliciting his benevolence  I had been obliged to sell my wardrobe article by article  There was nothing more left than was absolutely necessary to make a decent appearance  I no longer went to the ordinary  because I had no longer wherewithal to pay my score  How then did I make shift to keep body and soul together  There was every morning  in our offices  a scanty breakfast set out  consisting of a little bread and wine  this was the whole of our commons on the minister s establishment  I never knew what it was to exceed this stint during the day  and at night I most frequently went supperless to bed   Such was the fare of a man who made a splendid figure at court  but his illustrious fortunes  like those of other courtiers  were more a subject of pity than of grudge  I could no longer resist the pressure of my circumstances  and ultimately resolved on their disclosure at a seasonable opportunity  By good luck such an occasion offered at the Escurial  whither the king and the Prince of Spain removed some days afterwards       CH  VI     Gil Blas gives the Duke of Lerma a hint of his wretched condition  That minister deals with him accordingly   WHEN the king kept his court at the Escurial  all the world was at free quarters  under such easy circumstances I did not feel where the saddle galled  My bed was in a wardrobe near the duke s chamber  One morning that minister  having got up according to his cursed custom at daybreak  made me take my writing apparatus  and follow him into the palace gardens  We went and sat down under an avenue of trees  myself  as he would have it  in the posture of a man writing on the crown of his hat  his attitude was with a paper in his hand  and any one would have supposed he had been reading  At some distance  we must have looked as if the scale of Europe was to turn upon our decision  but between ourselves  who partook of it  the talk was miserably trifling   For more than an hour had I been tickling his excellency s fancy with
