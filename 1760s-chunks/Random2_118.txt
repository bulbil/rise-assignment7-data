Diana choros  —  The doctor and Banter were   356 surpriz d to hear my man speak Latin  but when my father led Narcissa into the room  the object of their admiration was soon changed  as appear d in the countenances of both —Indeed they must have been the most insensible of all beings  could they have beheld without emotion the divine creature that approached  She was dressed in a sack of white sattin  embroidered on the breast with gold  the crown of her head was covered with a small French cap  from whence descended her beautiful hair in ringlets that waved upon her snowy neck  which dignified the necklace I had given her  her looks glowed with modesty and love  and her bosom  thro  the veil of gauze that shaded it  afforded a prospect of Elyzium —I received this inestimable gift of providence as became me  and in a little time the clergyman did his office  my uncle  at his own earnest request  acting the part of a father to my dear Narcissa  who trembled very much  and had scarce spirits sufficient to support her under this great change of situation —Soon as she was mine by the laws of heaven and earth  I printed a burning kiss upon her lips  my father embraced her tenderly  my uncle hugged her with great affection  and I presented her to my friend Banter  who saluted her in a very polite manner  Miss Williams hung round her neck  and wept plentifully  while Strap fell upon his knees  and begged to kiss his lady s hand  which she presented with great affability —I shall not pretend to describe my own feelings at this juncture  let it suffice to say  that after having supped and entertained ourselves  till ten a clock  I cautioned my Narcissa against exposing her health by sitting up too late  and she   357 was prevailed upon to withdraw with her maid to an apartment destin d for us  When she left the room  her face was overspread with a blush that set all my blood in a state of fermentation  and made every pulse beat with tenfold vigour  She was so cruel as to let me remain in this condition a full half hour  when  no longer able to restrain my impatience  I broke from the company  burst into her chamber  pushed out her confidante  locked the door  and found her—O heav n and earth  a feast  a thousand times more delicious than my most sanguine hope presaged —But let me not profane the chaste mysteries of hymen—I was the happiest of men     In the morning I was awaked by three or four drums  which Banter had placed under the window  upon which I withdrew the curtain  and enjoyed the unspeakable satisfaction of contemplating those angelic charms  which were now in my possession  Beauty  which whether sleeping or awake  shot forth peculiar graces —The light darting upon my Narcissa s eyes  she awoke also  and recollecting her situation  hid her blushes in my bosom —I was distracted with joy  I could not believe the evidence of my senses  and looked upon all that had happened  as the fictions of a dream  In the mean time my uncle knocked at the door  and bid me turn out  for I had had a long spell —I got up accordingly  and sent Miss Williams to her mistress  myself receiving the congratulation of captain Bowling  who rallied me in his sea phrase  with great success —In less than an hour  Don Rodriguez led my wife in to breakfast  where she received the compliments   358 of the company on her looks  which  they said  if possible  were improved by matrimony —As her delicate ears were offended with none of those indecent ambiguities  which are too often spoke on such occasions  she behaved with dignity  unaffected modesty  and ease  and as a testimony of my affection and esteem  I presented her  in presence of them all  with a deed  by which I settled the whole fortune I was possessed of  on her and her heirs for ever —She accepted it with a glance of most tender acknowledgment  observed  that she could not be surprized at any thing of this kind I should do  and desired my father to take the trouble of keeping it  saying     Next to my own Mr  Random  you are the person in whom I ought to have the greatest confidence    Charm d with her prudent and ingenuous manner of proceeding  he took the paper  and assured her that it should not lose its value while in his custody     As we had not many visits to give and receive  the little time we stayed in town was spent in going to publick diversions  where I have the vanity to think Narcissa seldom was eclipsed —One night in particular  we had sent our footman to keep one of the stage boxes  which we no sooner entered  than we perceived in the opposite box the Squire and his lady  who seem d not a little surprised at seeing us  I was pleased at this opportunity of confronting them  the more  because Melinda was robbed of all her admirers by my wife  who happened that night to outshine her sister both in beauty and dress
