all that is dutiful  brave  pious  worthy  And would sometimes add  God reward him  I cannot  But when he mentioned the word dutiful  he would look at them  as if he had in his thoughts their resisting him in his intention of reinstating their governess  the only time  they could recollect  that they had given him the shadow of displeasure   The Ladies went on  and said  that Sir Thomas  in all companies  gloried in his son  And once Lord W  who himself  on his Lady s death  openly indulged himself in liberties which before he was only suspected to take  O my Lucy  how rare a character  in this age  is that of a virtuous man   told some gentlemen  who wonder d that Sir Thomas Grandison could permit a son so beloved to be absent from him so many years  that the reason Sir Thomas gave was  that his son s morals and his own were so different  that he should not be able to bear his own consciousness  if he consented to his return to England  The unhappy man was so habituated to vice  that he could talk familiarly of his gaieties to his intimates  seeming to think them too well known for him to endeavour to conceal them  but  however  would add sometimes  I intend to set about altering my course of life  and then will I send for my son  But  alas  Sir Thomas went on from year to year  only intending  He lived not to begin the promised alteration  nor to see his son   Yet one awakener he had  that made him talk of beginning the alteration of his way of living out of hand  and of sending for his son  which last act was to be the fore runner of his reformation   It happen d  that Mrs  Farnborough the woman he lived with when in town  was struck with the smallpox  in the height of her gaiety and pleasure  for she   147 was taken ill at the opera  on seeing a Lady of her acquaintance there  whose face bore too strongly the marks of the distemper  and who  it seems  had made her first visit to that place  rather than to a better  The malady  aided by her terror  proved mortal  and Sir Thomas was so much affected with the warning  that he left town  and  in pursuance of his temporary good resolutions  went down to his daughters  talked of sending for his son  and  for some few months  lived like the man of sense and understanding he was known to be   LETTER XIV  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   LORD L  returned from his travels about the time that Mrs  Farnborough was taken ill  He had brought some presents to Sir Thomas from his son  who took all opportunities to send him over curiosities  some of considerable value  which served at the same time to shew his oeconomy  and his duty  He forgot not  in this way  his sisters  tho  his accompanying letters were short  and merely polite  and such as required no other answer than thanks  Only they could discover by them  that he had warm wishes to be allowed to return to England  but such a submission to his father s pleasure  as entirely to give up his own   Sir Thomas seemed fond of Lord L  And  setting out  on Mrs  Farnborough s death  for Grandisonhall gave him an invitation to visit him there  for he would listen with pleasure  an hour together  to him  or to any one  who would talk  and give him some account of his son  How predominant must those passions  those habits  be in his heart  which could take place of a Love so laudably paternal   In pursuance of this invitation  Lord L  attended   148 him at the Hall  and there fell in Love with the eldest of the young Ladies  He revealed his passion to her  She referred herself wholly to her father  Sir Thomas could not be blind to their mutual affection  Every body saw it  Lord L s passion was of the ardent kind  and he was too honest to wish to conceal it  But yet Sir Thomas would not see it  He behaved  however  with great freedom and civility to my Lord  so that the heart of the young Lady was insensibly engaged  but he avoided several opportunities which the Lover had lain in wait for  to open his mind  and make proposals   At last  my Lord desired an audience of Sir Thomas  as upon a subject of the last importance  The Baronet  after some little delays  and not without some inauspicious reluctance  granted it  And then my Lord revealed his passion to him   Sir Thomas asked him  if he had made it known to his daughter  And yet must have seen  on an hundred occasions  at breakfast  at dinner  at tea  at supper  how matters stood with both the Lovers  if Miss Grandison s pleasant account of the matter may be depended upon   Lord L  owned he had  and that he
