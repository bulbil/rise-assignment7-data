which it appeared that he was really a gentleman of fashion and fortune  and they resolved to compromise the affair without the intervention of his worship  Accordingly  the serjeant repaired to the constable s house  where the knight was lodged  and humbled himself before his honour  protesting with many oaths  that  if he had known his quality  he would have beaten the drummer s brains about his ears  for presuming to give his honour or his horse the least disturbance  thof the fellow  he believed  was sufficiently punished in being a cripple for life    Sir Launcelot admitted of his apologies  and taking compassion on the fellow who had suffered so severely for his folly  resolved to provide for his maintenance  Upon the representation of the parties to the justice  the warrant was next day discharged  and the knight returned to his own house  attended by the serjeant and the drummer mounted on horseback  the recruits being left to the corporal s charge    The halberdier found the good effects of Sir Launcelot s liberality  and his companion being rendered unfit for his majesty s service  by the heels of Gilbert  is now entertained at Greavesbury Hall  where he will probably remain for life    As for Crabshaw  his master gave him to understand  that if he did not think him pretty well chastised for his presumption and flight  by the discipline he had undergone in the last two adventures  he would turn him out of his service with disgrace  Timothy said he believed it would be the greatest favour he could do him to turn him out of a service in which he knew he should be rib roasted every day  and murdered at last    In this situation were things at Greavesbury Hall about a month ago  when I crossed the country to Ferrybridge  where I met my uncle  Probably  this is the first incident of their second excursion  for the distance between this here house and Sir Launcelot s estate does not exceed fourscore or ninety miles              CHAPTER SIX  IN WHICH THE READER WILL PERCEIVE THAT IN SOME CASES MADNESS IS CATCHING   Mr  Clarke having made an end of his narrative  the surgeon thanked him for the entertainment he had received  and Mr  Ferret shrugged up his shoulders in silent disapprobation  As for Captain Crowe  who used at such pauses to pour in a broadside of dismembered remarks  linked together like chain shot  he spoke not a syllable for some time  but  lighting a fresh pipe at the candle  began to roll such voluminous clouds of smoke as in an instant filled the whole apartment  and rendered himself invisible to the whole company  Though he thus shrouded himself from their view  he did not long remain concealed from their hearing  They first heard a strange dissonant cackle  which the doctor knew to be a sea laugh  and this was followed by an eager exclamation of  Rare pastime  strike my yards and topmasts —I ve a good mind—why shouldn t— many a losing voyage I ve—smite my taffrel but I wool —  By this time he had relaxed so much in his fumigation  that the tip of his nose and one eye reappeared  and as he had drawn his wig forwards  so as to cover his whole forehead  the figure that now saluted their eyes was much more ferocious and terrible than the fire breathing chimera of the ancients  Notwithstanding this dreadful appearance  there was no indignation in his heart  but  on the contrary  an agreeable curiosity  which he was determined to gratify   Addressing himself to Mr  Fillet   Pr ythee  doctor   said he   canst tell  whether a man  without being rated a lord or a baron  or what d ye call um  d ye see  may n t take to the highway in the way of a frolic  d ye see —Adad  for my own part  brother  I m resolved as how to cruise a bit in the way of an arrant—if so be as I can t at once be commander  mayhap I may be bore upon the books as a petty officer or the like  d ye see     Now  the Lord forbid   cried Clarke  with tears in his eyes   I d rather see you dead than brought to such a dilemma    Mayhap thou wouldst   answered the uncle   for then  my lad  there would be some picking—aha  dost thou tip me the traveller  my boy   Tom assured him he scorned any such mercenary views   I am only concerned   said he   that you should take any step that might tend to the disgrace of yourself or your family  and I say again I had rather die than live to see you reckoned any otherwise than compos  — Die and be d—ned  you shambling half timber d son of a——   cried the choleric Crowe   dost talk to me of keeping a reckoning and compass —I could keep a reckoning  and box my compass long enough before thy keelstone was laid—Sam Crowe is not come here to ask thy counsel how to steer his course    Lord  sir
