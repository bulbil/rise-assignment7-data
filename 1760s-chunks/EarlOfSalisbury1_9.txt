commanded him to conduct me to the prison where Les  Roches lay confined  The poor man  who was no stranger to my quality or  to my hazardous situation  expressed the utmost horror and  astonishment  and in language rude and unrefined  yet such as denoted an  honest and a tender affection  attempted to remonstrate against such a  perilous design  I shewed him gold  but this had no effect  I then drew  my sword  and threatened him with the utmost severity of vengeance   unless he instantly obeyed my command  Terror seemed to have a greater  influence than entreaties or promises  He changed his course and called  on me to follow  Thus  directed  I eagerly took the path which I supposed would lead me to my  friend  filled with the high thoughts of obtaining his freedom by a free  resignation of my own  But after long traversing the gloomy and tedious  way  I found too late that either fear and darkness had misled my  conductor  or that he had purposely deceived my expectations  for when  the dawn began to appear  we found ourselves suddenly prevented from all  farther progress by a deep and rapid current  The peasant trembled  but  I had no power  however irritated  to punish his error  or his mistaken  tenderness  Exhausted as I was  with fatigue and inward agitation  my  arm with difficulty took the casque from my forehead  I dipped it in  the stream  and drank deeply  then resigning my feeble limbs to the  dank ground  insensible of all danger  and indifferent to my fate  I  funk into a profound sleep  nor did I awaken till the meridian fun  slashed upon me with it s beams and roused me by the full force of their  heat and brightness  I called on the peasant  but he had deferted me  I  arose  and wandered slowly along the banks of the river  without purpose  or direction  and so freely did I indulge the wandering of my thoughts   so far was I lost to recollection  that I never once perceived the found  of approaching feet  till I was encompassed by fix armed men  who  proved  as I at once supposed  the guards of Count Mal leon —But  my  friend  why should I abuse thy indulgence  by this minute detail  Night  steals fast from us  Let me not forget what thy age demands    No    replied Randolph   think not of me  my soul is all attention to the  misfortunes of my leader  Haste and give to my impatience the story of  thy deliverance  that I too  in my turn  may relate the things which  demand thy serious ear  —The Earl then proceeded                    SECT  IV     THE soldiers required my name  my purpose  and destination  and as I had  long since resigned all hopes of escape  I discovered myself without  reserve or difficulty  Two of them were instantly dismissed with a nod   and departed with the most precipitate speed  Whilst the remaining  number  with that courtesy and respect  which bespoke them the brave and  generous sons of honourable war  conducted me to a cottage that lay at  some small distance  fast by the margin of the current  Here I was  treated  not with imperious insolence  the effects of base and  dishonourable enmity  but with all humane and kind regards due to a  brave unfortunate  This encouraged me to attempt some conference with  my keepers  who  on their part  discovered no reluctance to gratify  their prisoner  From them I learned that my guide had really mistaken  the way  and that I now lay within one hour s distance from the castle  of their Lord  I earnestly enquired after the fate of Les Roches  and  heard with a mixture of joy  and vexation at my own precipitate conduct   that on the preceding night  he had been released from his captivity   When I expressed my surprize and satisfaction at this event  I was told  that immediately after that the surviving Englishmen had been ransomed  by the bounty of Les Roches  and suffered  at his intercession  to  depart  Count Savourè had received information that one of them had  rashly discovered  that the Lord of Salisbury  their leader  was still  in the isle of Rhè  This instantly kindled up a flame of passion in his  breast  He affected to regard the tale of their distress as vain and  fictitious  and expressed strong apprehensions of a conspiracy formed by  his enemies in concert with his officer to seize the island  In this  sudden and violent fit of rage  he had commanded Les Roches to prison   and ordered astrict guard to watch round the coast  The Frenchman   conscious  of his own innocence  exclaimed loudly against the severity of his  commander  mentioned the inconsiderable number of the Englishmen that  had appeared  and enlarged on the unreasonable nature of the Count s  suspicions
