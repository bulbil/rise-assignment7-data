pardon of Heaven for all his sins  as he intended to devote one of his daughters to a conventual life as an expiation       This way of being virtuous by proxy  is certainly very easy and convenient to such sinners as have children to sacrifice       By Colonel Rivers  who leaves us in a few days  I intend myself the honor of addressing your Lordship again       I have the honor to be  Your Lordship s   c   WM  FERMOR     LETTER CLIII   153   To the Earl of —    Silleri  June 9   YOUR Lordship will receive this from the hands of one of the most worthy and amiable men I ever knew  Colonel Rivers  whom I am particularly happy in having the honor to introduce to your Lordship  as I know your delicacy in the choice of friends  and that there are so few who have your perfect esteem and confidence  that the acquaintance of one who merits both  at his time of life  will be regarded  even by your Lordship  as an acquisition        Tis to him I shall say the advantage I procure him  by making him known to a nobleman  who  with the wisdom and experience of age  has all the warmth of heart  the generosity  the noble confidence  the enthusiasm  the fire  and vivacity of youth       Your Lordship s idea  in regard to Protestant convents here  on the footing of that we visited together at Hamburgh  is extremely well worth the consideration of those whom it may concern  especially if the Romish ones are abolished  as will most probably be the case       The noblesse have numerous families  and  if there are no convents  will be at a loss where to educate their daughters  as well as where to dispose of those who do not marry in a reasonable time  the convenience they find in both respects from these houses  is one strong motive to them to continue in their ancient religion       As I would however prevent the more useful  by which I mean the lower  part of the sex from entering into this state  I would wish only the daughters of the seigneurs to have the privilege of becoming nuns  they should be obliged  on taking the vow  to prove their noblesse for at least three generations  which would secure them respect  and  at the same time  prevent their becoming too numerous       They should take the vow of obedience  but not of celibacy  and reserve the power  as at Hamburgh  of going out to marry  though on no other consideration       Your Lordship may remember  every nun at Hamburgh has a right of marrying  except the abbess  and that  on your Lordship s telling the lady who then presided  and who was young and very handsome  you thought this a hardship  she answered with great spirit   O  my Lord  you know it is in my power to resign        I refer your Lordship to Colonel Rivers for that farther information in regard to this colony  which he is much more able to give you than I am  having visited every part of Canada in the design of settling in it        I have the honor to be   My Lord   c   WM  FERMOR       Your Lordship s mention of nuns has brought to my memory a little anecdote on this subject  which I will tell you        I was  a few mornings ago  visiting a French lady  whose very handsome daughter  of almost sixteen  told me  she was going into a convent  I enquired which she had made choice of  she said   The General Hospital         I am glad  Mademoiselle  you have not chose the Ursulines  the rules are so very severe  you would have found them hard to conform to         As to the rules  Sir  I have no objection to their severity  but the habit of the General Hospital        I smiled        Is so very light         And so becoming  Mademoiselle        She smiled in her turn  and I left her fully convinced of the sincerity of her vocation  and the great propriety and humanity of suffering young creatures to chuse a kind of life so repugnant to human nature  at an age when they are such excellent judges of what will make them happy     LETTER CLIV   154   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   Silleri  June 9   I SEND this by your brother  who sails to morrow       Time  I hope  will reconcile me to his and Emily s absence  but at present I cannot think of losing them without a dejection of mind which takes from me the very idea of pleasure       I conjure you  my dear Lucy  to do every thing possible to facilitate their union  and remember  that to your request  and to Mrs  Rivers s tranquillity  they have sacrificed every prospect they had of happiness
