measure to see the mystery so easily unfolded  The joy that now diffused itself in the hearts of our lovers  is more easily conceived than described  but  in order to give a stability to this mutual satisfaction  it was necessary that Aurelia should be secured from the tyranny of her uncle  whose power of guardianship would not otherwise expire for some months   Dr  Kawdle and his lady having entered into their deliberations on the subject  it was agreed that Miss Darnel should have recourse to the protection of the Lord Chancellor  but such application was rendered unnecessary by the unexpected arrival of John Clump with the following letter to Mrs  Kawdle from the steward of Anthony Darnel  dated at Aurelia s house in the country —   MADAM —It hath pleased God to afflict Mr  Darnel with a severe stroke of the dead palsy —He was taken ill yesterday  and now lies insensible  seemingly at the point of death  Among the papers in his pocket I found the enclosed  by which it appears that my honoured young lady  Miss Darnel  is confined in a private madhouse  I am afraid Mr  Darnel s fate is a just judgment of God upon him for his cruelty to that excellent person  I need not exhort you  madam  to take immediately upon the receipt of this  such measures as will be necessary for the enlargement of my poor young lady  In the meantime  I shall do the needful for the preservation of her property in this place  and send you an account of any further alteration that may happen  being very respectfully  madam  your most obedient humble servant  RALPH MATTOCKS    Clump had posted up to London with this intimation on the wings of love  and being covered with clay from the heels to the eyes upwards  he appeared in such an unfavourable light at Dr  Kawdle s door  that the footman refused him admittance  Nevertheless  he pushed him aside  and fought his way upstairs into the dining room  where the company was not a little astonished at such an apparition   The fellow himself was no less amazed at seeing Aurelia and his own sweetheart Mrs  Dolly Cowslip  He forthwith fell upon his knees  and in silence held out the letter  which was taken by the doctor  and presented to his wife  according to the direction  She did not fail to communicate the contents  which were far from being unwelcome to the individuals who composed this little society  Mr  Clump was honoured with the approbation of his young lady  who commended him for his zeal and expedition  bestowed upon him a handsome gratuity in the meantime  and desired to see him again when he should be properly refreshed after the fatigue he had undergone   Mr  Thomas Clarke being consulted on this occasion  gave it as his opinion  that Miss Darnel should  without delay  choose another guardian for the few months that remained of her minority  The opinion was confirmed by the advice of some eminent lawyers  to whom immediate recourse was had  and Dr  Kawdle being the person pitched upon for this office  the necessary forms were executed with all possible despatch   The first use the doctor made of his guardianship was to sign a power  constituting Mr  Ralph Mattocks his attorney pro tempore for managing the estate of Miss Aurelia Darnel  and this was forwarded to the steward by the hands of Clump  who set out with it for the seat of Darnel Hill  though not without a heavy heart  occasioned by some intimation he had received concerning the connexion between his dear Dolly and Mr  Clarke  the lawyer             CHAPTER THE LAST  WHICH  IT IS TO BE HOPED  WILL BE  ON MORE ACCOUNTS THAN ONE  AGREEABLE TO THE READER   Sir Launcelot  having vindicated the liberty  confirmed the safety  and secured the heart of his charming Aurelia  now found leisure to unravel the conspiracy which had been executed against his person  and with that view commenced a lawsuit against the owner of the house where he and his mistress had been separately confined  Mr  Shackle was  notwithstanding all the submissions and atonement which he offered to make  either in private or in public  indicted on the statute of kidnapping  tried  convicted  punished by a severe fine and standing in the pillory  A judicial writ ad inquirendum being executed  the prisons of his inquisition were laid open  and several innocent captives enlarged   In the course of Shackle s trial  it appeared that the knight s confinement was a scheme executed by his rival Mr  Sycamore  according to the device of his counsellor  Dawdle  who  by this contrivance  had reconciled himself to his patron  after having deserted him in the day of battle  Our hero was so incensed at this discovery of Sycamore s treachery and ingratitude  that he went in quest of him immediately  to take vengeance on his person  accompanied by Captain Crowe  who wanted to balance accounts with Mr  Dawdle  But those gentlemen had wisely avoided the impending storm  by retiring to the continent  on pretence of travelling for improvement   Sir Launcelot was not now so much of a knight errant as to leave Aurelia to
