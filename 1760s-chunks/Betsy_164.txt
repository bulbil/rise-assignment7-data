himself     I told him  Madam   resumed Mrs  Modely   that it would not   be well taken from me  but he was quite mad  would listen to no reason    till I bethought myself of a strategem  which I fancy you will not   disapprove  I made him believe that there was no need of my going to   you  that you were to call upon me about a gown this afternoon  that I   would persuade you to stay and drink tea  and he might come into the   room  as if by chance  and entertain you with what discourse he thought   proper  Now  I would fain have you come   pursued she   for if you do   but like his person  such an offer is not to be rejected         I do not regard this offer   said Miss Betsy   but I do not know but I   may come just to divert myself a little     That is a dear good lady     cried the other   About five  I believe  will be a proper time     Aye    thereabout   replied Miss Betsy   but  dear Modely  don t let him know   you have spoke a word to me concerning him     No  no   said she   I   shall not tell him I have seen you        During the whole time this woman staid   which was  indeed  much longer   than might have been expected from a person of that extraordinary   business she pretended  nothing was talked of but Sir Frederick Fineer    she told Miss Betsy  that to her certain knowledge  he was of one of the   best families in Cornwall  that he had a great estate in possession  and   another in reversion  and  besides  was the next of kin to a coronet    that he kept company with nothing but lords and dukes  and that they   were always courting his company       Though Miss Betsy affected to treat all she said with indifference  yet   she had given an attentive ear to it  and  after she was gone  began to   rummage over all her ornaments  tried one  and then another  to see   which would become her best  in order to secure a victory  which she   imagined would afford so much triumph   Whether I marry him or not     said she to herself   the addresses of a man of his rank will make me of   some consideration in the world  and if ever I do become a wife  I   should like to be a woman of quality  they may say what they will  but a   title has prodigious charms in it  the name Fineer also becomes it     Lady Fineer s servants there  Lady Fineer s coach to the door   would   sound vastly agreeable at the play or opera        She also pleased herself with the thought  that being courted by a   person of Sir Frederick s quality and estate would immediately put to   silence all the reproaches and remonstrances she might otherwise have   expected to be persecuted with by her brother Frank  on Mr  Trueworth s   account  and this imagination was of itself sufficient to give her an   infinite satisfaction  in fine  she found so much in this new effect of   her charms  to elevate and delight both her vanity and convenience  that   she longed with as much impatience for a sight of her admirer as Mrs    Modely had told her he was under for a second interview with her       Some part of the tedious moments were  however  taken up in a manner she   was far from expecting  she was scarce risen from her toilette  when   word was brought her that a young lady  who called herself Miss Flora   Mellasin  was come to wait upon her  As she had never seen her since her   being driven from Mr  Goodman s  the visit a little surprized her  and   she would have been glad if common civility had dispensed with her   receiving it  for though the pity she then had felt for her misfortunes   had greatly effaced the memory of the injurious treatment she had met   with from her  yet she never desired to continue any correspondence   with her after they were once parted  besides  as she had no reason to   look upon her coming as any proof of her friendship or good will  but   rather with a design of doing her some private prejudice  she resolved   to behave entirely reserved towards her       Her conjectures were not groundless  that complication of every worst   passion that can fill the human heart  could not be perfectly satisfied
