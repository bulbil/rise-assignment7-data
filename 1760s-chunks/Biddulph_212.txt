own life  but Sir George a little quieted my fears  by shewing me his sword  which still lay on the table  and which  at my desire  he put out of the way   My brother approached the closet door  and in the most soothing language beseeched him to open it  but he could get no other answer from Mr Faulkland than to beg he would leave him to himself   I found this was not a time for arguing  I told my brother  we had better suffer him to vent his passion alone  and that  perhaps  when he had time to reflect a little on what had been said  he would permit his cooler reason to govern him   Sir George was very unwilling to leave him in such a distracted state of mind  he renewed his efforts to persuade him to come out of the closet  but to no purpose   I beseech you to leave me  Sir George  said he  I am not in a condition to talk—I cannot bear the sight of Mrs Arnold—let me recover myself—another time perhaps I may be better able to    discourse with you   Will you promise me then  replied my brother  that you will in the interim do nothing that may be injurious to your life or health  Indeed  my dear Faulkland  you distress my sister and me more than you can imagine  Name the hour when you will permit me to come to you again  and for heaven’s sake think of your own immediate preservation  that once secured  there is nothing which my sister and I will not afterwards do to make you happy—Can I rely on you  Faulkland  do you promise me not to be rash  You have my sword in your possession  answered Mr Faulkland   still speaking within the closet  I have no other weapon about me—leave me  Sir George—I cannot talk   Say but that you wish to see me again  replied my brother  and I will go  and give you no further trouble  Mr Faulkland sighed deeply  Say  I wish to see you  he repeated  ah  Bidulph  and his voice seemed choaked  My brother could not refrain from tears  I will come to you in the evening  Faulkland—You will find me your true friend —I should be loath to lay you under any restraint here  in the house of my friend  do but say there is no need of it  Promise me—the slightest word will suffice  I know my dear Faulkland will not break his word   Well—I will not attempt my life  cried he impatiently  let that satisfy you—leave me  and let me not be exposed to any insults here   I leave you  answered my brother  and hope to find you more composed a few hours hence  Mrs Arnold too begs you will be calm  and think of preserving a life which is so dear to us both   Mr Faulkland was silent  and my brother and I withdrew  he thought it best I should not speak to him   Sir George left me at home  and said he would call again on Mr Faulkland in the afternoon  and bring me word how he should find him  My brother is exceedingly affected with his situation  and says he knows not what to advise  He is fearful that Mr Faulkland’s phrenzy is not to be calmed  but by consenting to marry him  and circumstanced as he now is  that thought is terrible  Yet  if I persist in my refusal  I drive the noblest of minds to desperation  Oh  my Cecilia  is this the return I ought to make to the most generous of men  whose fervent love for me has been a constant source of torment to him for so many years  Yet how can I yield him my hand  All my former scruples  weighty as they appeared to me  were light to the dreadful bar that now interposes     Had that ill fated woman died the common way  with what joy  what exultation could I have rewarded his honest persevering love  all my duties fulfilled  obedience to my mother  justice to the woman I thought injured  reverence to the memory of my husband  the respect due to my own character  Should I not  my Cecilia  after thus being acquitted of all other obligations  have been to blame  if  after a series of misfortunes  all brought on by my strict adherence to those duties  should I not have been to blame for refusing at length to do justice to the most deserving of men  When I reflect on the past  when I survey the present  and my foreboding heart whispers to me the future sufferings of our dear unhappy Mr Faulkland  all my philosophy forsakes me  I have borne up under my own sorrows—his quite subdue me—I must lay by my pen—my eyes are brimful of tears     Ah  my dear  what will become of us  I am almost dead with apprehension  Rash  rash  unhappy Mr Faulkland  He has fled from the house where my brother had concealed him  I know not what I am writing  my fears distract me  ’Tis but two hours since we left him  Sir George relying on his promise
