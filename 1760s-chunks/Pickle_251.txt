passion I  had felt for S    my fidelity was inviolable  and I never harboured the  most distant thought of any other person  till after I had resolved  to leave him  when  I own  I afforded some small encouragement to the  addresses of a new admirer by telling him  that I should  in a little  time  be my own mistress  though I was not now at my own disposal    I enjoyed my new house as a little paradise  It was accommodated with  all sorts of conveniences  everything was new  and therefore pleasing   and the whole absolutely at my command  I had the company of a relation   a very good woman  with whom I lived in the most amicable manner  was  visited by the best people in town  I mean those of the male sex  the  ladies having long ago forsaken me  I frequented all reputable places of  public entertainment  and had a concert at home once a week  so that  my days rolled on in happiness and quiet  till all my sweets were  embittered by the vexatious behaviour of my husband  who began to  importune me again to live with him  and by the increasing anxiety of  Lord B    who  though I still admitted his visits  plainly perceived  that I wanted to relinquish his correspondence  This discovery raised  such tempests of jealousy and despair within his breast  that he kept  me in continual alarm  He sent messages to me every hour  signed his  letters with his own blood  raved like a man in ecstasy of madness   railed at my ingratitude  and praised my conduct by turns  He offered  to sacrifice everything for my love  to leave the kingdom forthwith  and  live with me for ever in any part of the world where I should choose to  reside    These were generous and tempting proposals  but I was beset with  counsellors who were not totally disinterested  and who dissuaded me    6 22 15  3 45 PM   from embracing the proffers of my lover  on pretence that Lord    would  be highly injured by my compliance  I listened to their advice  and  hardened my heart against Lord B   s sorrow and solicitations  My  behaviour on this occasion is altogether unaccountable  this was the  only time that ever I was a slave to admonition  The condition of Lord  B   would have melted any heart but mine  and yet mine was one of the  most sensible  He employed his cousin as an advocate with me  till that  gentleman actually refused the office  telling him candidly  that his  own inclinations were too much engaged to permit him to perform the task  with fidelity and truth  He accordingly resolved to avoid my presence   until my lord and I should come to some final determination  which was  greatly retarded by the perseverance of his lordship  who would not  resign his hopes  even when I pretended that another man had engaged my  heart  but said  that in time my affection might return    Our correspondence  however  gradually wore off  upon which Mr   B   renewed his visits  and many agreeable and happy hours we passed  together  Not that he  or any other person whom I now saw  succeeded to  the privilege of a fortunate lover  I knew he loved me to madness  but  I would not gratify his passion any other way than by the most profound  esteem and veneration for his virtues  which were altogether amiable and  sublime  and I would here draw his character minutely  but it would  take up too much time to set forth his merit  the only  man living of  my acquaintance who resembles him  is Lord F    of whom I shall speak in  the sequel    About this time I underwent a very interesting change in the situation  of my heart  I had sent a message to my old lover S    desiring he would  allow my picture  which was in his possession  to be copied  and he  now transmitted it to me by my lawyer  whom he directed to ask  if I  intended to be at the next masquerade  This curiosity had a strange  effect upon my spirits  my heart fluttered at the question  and my  imagination glowed with a thousand fond presages  I answered in the  affirmative  and we met by accident at the ball  I could nut behold him  without emotion  when he accosted me  his well known voice made my heart  vibrate  like a musical chord  when its unison is struck  All the ideas  of our past love  which the lapse of time and absence had enfeebled and  lulled to sleep  now awoke  and were reinspired by his appearance  so  that his artful excuses were easily admitted  I forgave him all that  I had suffered on his account  because he was the natural lord of my  affection  and our former correspondence was renewed    I thought myself
