another person  whom he settled in the same business under my nose  Being thus disabled from making punctual payments  my commodities spoiling  and my wife breaking her heart  I grew negligent and careless  took to drinking  and my affairs went to wreck  Being one day in liquor  and provoked by the fleers and taunts of the man who had set up against me  I struck him at his own door  upon which I was carried before the justice  who treated me with such insolence  that I became desperate  and not only abused him in the execution of his office  but also made an attempt to lay violent hands upon his person  You know  sir  when a man is both drunk and desperate  he cannot be supposed to have any command of himself  I was sent hither to jail  My creditors immediately seized my effects  and  as they were not sufficient to discharge my debts  a statute of bankruptcy was taken out against me  so that here I must lie  until they think proper to sign my certificate  or the parliament shall please to pass an act for the relief of insolvent debtors    The next person who presented himself in the crowd of accusers was a meagre figure  with a green apron  who told the knight that he had kept a public house in town for a dozen years  and enjoyed a good trade  which was in a great measure owing to a skittle ground  in which the best people of the place diverted themselves occasionally  That Justice Gobble  being disobliged at his refusing to part with a gelding which he had bred for his own use  first of all shut up the skittle ground  but  finding the publican still kept his house open  he took care that he should be deprived of his licence  on pretence that the number of ale houses was too great  and that this man had been bred to another employment  The poor publican being thus deprived of his bread  was obliged to try the staymaking business  to which he had served an apprenticeship  but being very ill qualified for this profession  he soon fell to decay and contracted debts  in consequence of which he was now in prison  where he had no other support but what arose from the labour of his wife  who had gone to service   The next prisoner who preferred his complaint against the unrighteous judge was a poacher  at whose practices Justice Gobble had for some years connived  so as even to screen him from punishment  in consideration of being supplied with game gratis  till at length he was disappointed by accident  His lady had invited guests to an entertainment  and bespoke a hare  which the poacher undertook to furnish  He laid his snares accordingly overnight  but they were discovered  and taken away by the gamekeeper of the gentleman to whom the ground belonged  All the excuses the poacher could make proved ineffectual in appeasing the resentment of the justice and his wife at being thus disconcerted  Measures were taken to detect the delinquent in the exercise of his illicit occupation  he was committed to safe custody  and his wife  with five bantlings  was passed to her husband s settlement in a different part of the country   A stout squat fellow  rattling with chains  had just taken up the ball of accusation  when Sir Launcelot was startled with the appearance of a woman  whose looks and equipage indicated the most piteous distress  She seemed to be turned of the middle age  was of a lofty carriage  tall  thin  weather beaten  and wretchedly attired  her eyes were inflamed with weeping  and her looks displayed that wildness and peculiarity which denote distraction  Advancing to Sir Launcelot  she fell upon her knees  and  clasping her hands together  uttered the following rhapsody in the most vehement tone of affliction —   Thrice potent  generous  and august emperor  here let my knees cleave to the earth  until thou shalt do me justice on that inhuman caitiff Gobble  Let him disgorge my substance which he hath devoured  let him restore to my widowed arms my child  my boy  the delight of my eyes  the prop of my life  the staff of my sustenance  whom he hath torn from my embrace  stolen  betrayed  sent into captivity  and murdered  Behold these bleeding wounds upon his lovely breast  see how they mangle his lifeless corse  Horror  give me my child  barbarians  his head shall lie upon his Suky s bosom—she will embalm him with her tears  Ha  plunge him in the deep —shall my boy then float in a watery tomb  Justice  most mighty emperor  justice upon the villain who hath ruined us all  May Heaven s dreadful vengeance overtake him  may the keen storm of adversity strip him of all his leaves and fruit  may peace forsake his mind  and rest be banished from his pillow  so that all his days shall be filled with reproach and sorrow  and all his nights be haunted with horror and remorse  may he be stung by jealousy without cause  and maddened by revenge without the means of execution  may all his offspring be blighted and consumed  like the mildewed ears of corn  except one that shall
