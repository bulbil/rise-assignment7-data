for landing the troops  and formed a plan for that   purpose          You have discovered  sir     interrupted the general  haughtily      Pray  when and how did you make this notable discovery           Just now  sir    returned the officer  too intent upon the object   he had in view to take notice of the manner of his reception    The   transport in which I was  happening to stretch away ahead  I got   out a boat  and have carefully reconnoitered a great part of the   coast  in the thick of the enemy s fire          And pray  sir    interrupted the general again  determined not   to let him explain himself    who gave you orders to reconnoitre in   this manner           No  one  sir    answered the officer warmly  and hurt at the   manner in which the general spoke    I never wait for orders to         304 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     do anything in which my own safety is concerned  when I think it   for the advantage of the service          When you think     retorted the general sternly    I should be   glad to know who has appointed you to judge of those things     At this rate  the whole army will be generals by and by  and every   one will be out reconnoitering  forsooth  when they should be at   their posts  But I ll put a stop to such contempt of discipline    and make you know that it is your duty to wait for orders  not to   go rambling thus  wherever you please    Saying which  he called   one of his aides de camp  and putting the officer in arrest  sent him   away  bursting with indignation and resentment  to his ship      When he was gone â€”   I am very sorry    said my master    that   your engagement to that other man laid you under a necessity of   treating this officer so harshly  I have conceived a very good   opinion of him  He appeared to be actuated by true zeal  and   spoke with a confidence that showed he was convinced of what he   said  for which reason I am resolved to reconnoitre that place   myself  and don t doubt but I shall find his account of it to be just        Nor do T in the least  He has a head to plan  and a heart to   execute the most important enterprises  and I am as sorry for what   I have been forced to do as you  But  as soon as I have it in my   power to reward his merit  I ll give him every opportunity of dis    playing it  till when this affair will keep him out of the way        I see you are anxious to know the sequel of this officer s story    To avoid breaking the thread of my narrative with it  therefore    at another time  I will conclude it here      My master  as he said  went that very night  and reconnoitered   the place pointed out by the officer  whose account of it proved so   just  that he repaired to him directly  and inquiring into his plan   for landing the troops  found it so judicious  that he immediately   adopted the whole  and carried it into execution with success    After some days  when the officer s impatience of being idle thus in   the midst of action had in a great measure got the better of hia   resentment  and the severe loss sustained in the siege made the   worth of men more attended to  my master attacked him on his   foible  his passion for glory and zeal for the service of his country    and prevailed on him to return to his duty  on the general s making   an apology for what he had done  which he attributed to his anxiety    and apprehension of the enemy s being put on their guard by h5s   reconnoitering in that daring manner   and  to cancel the disgrace   of the arrest  treated him with particular attention   and as he   was now at liberty to do justice to his merit  the other  who had   been imposed upon him  being provided for   gave him the first   opportunity he could of signalizing himself  which he did in a manner   that amply justified the opinion my master had conceived of him    The afiiair was this  The general had resolved to make an
