door  and  presently after  the maid came to tell her  that a foreign gentleman s servant waited below with a message to deliver   20 to her from his master  Miss ELLIOT ordered her to show him up stairs directly  and at his entrance he acquainted her    That his master  the Marquis de MARIVEAUX  desired the favour of permission to pay his respects to her  which he should esteem equally a pleasure and an honour     This polite message made Miss ELLIOT S countenance glow with vanity  but being then in an undress  she returned for answer    that she should be proud of the honour of seeing the Marquis the next morning     He accordingly came between eleven and twelve the next day  and the first complimentary salutations being over  they entered into discourse as freely as though they had known each other for many years  After some time spent in this manner he took his leave  desiring the favour of being permitted to renew his visit another opportunity  and she in return assured him  that she should always look on it as doing her a very great honour    21 He then politely withdrew  leaving his charmer vastly exhilerated at the pleasure of receiving a visit from so accomplished a gentleman   The pretended Marquis was of a very amorous complexion  and had met with pretty good success among the ladies  though having never been in London before  he had not found any opportunity of engaging in intrigues  From his conversation with English gentlemen  he had acquired a tolerable knowledge of the tongue  and could converse on most topics pretty freely   To these accomplishments  if an exquisite knowledge of play be added  especially of the sharping part  to which he now owed his chief support  it will be easily perceived that he was very well qualified to make a fashionable appearance in the world  to undertake any scheme how ever imprudent or presumptuous   At his first visit he plainly saw that she was also a forune hunter like himself  though of a different kind  and as the   22 fortune of a gamester is very precarious  he resolved to keep her company  hoping to convert to his own use what her other lovers bestowed on her with so great profusion   Miss ELLIOT  who had penetration enough to see that she appeared very agreeable in the eyes of the Marquis  took an opportunity  one evening when he was at supper with her  to enter into discourse concerning love  and thereupon asked him   What he thought of the English ladies   He answered    that the chief part of those he had seen  were so very beautiful as not to be equalled in the world  but he had hitherto been so unfortunate as never to be engaged in company with any besides herself  otherwise he certainly should have lost his heart       Oh  Sir  answered she  if our English beauties are so engaging  and your heart so ready to be disposed of  I think I have a prior claim to it   Monsieur seemed charmed with this repartee  and Miss promised herself mighty advantages from his aquaintance  insomuch that    23 warmed with wine  they mutually agreed to sacrifice to Venus as to Bacchus  and the amorous enconter was so spirited on both sides  the first night  that they determined to pass a second together before they parted     Though Miss ELLIOT neither demanded  nor received any pecuniary reward at this interview  she vainly flattered herself she should be taken into keeping by the Marquis  and entertained in a manner agreeable to his present pompous appearance  but those hopes were soon banished  for the presumptuous MARRIVEAUX  not only arrogated to himself a title to be rewarded for his services  but  on her denial  availed himself of an opportunity of paying himself the wages he thought his due   His mistress indeed began to suspect the fallacy of his apparent dignity  yet she was so pleased with him as a gallant  that she denied not her embraces whenever it was convenient  though she now found a way to be introduced to the best company in town     24Amongst other valuable things she possessed  she had been presented by Mr  BROWN with a very fine brilliant solitaire  valued at two hundred guineas  the price of one night s lodging   which she generally wore about her neck  tied to a black ribbon  on this the noble Marquis had fixed his eye  and laid many schemes to get it in his possession  till the following at length succeeded  in the fondest moment of dalliance  under pretence of kissing her snowy bosom  he made shift to bite the solitaire from the ribbon as it hung about her neck  without her perceiving the fraud  and fold it to a jeweller in the city  who looked upon MARIVEAUX as a nobleman  since he bore the title  and maintained the appearance of one   But the event proved  that the artful Frenchman was deceived in his prize  for having dressed himself one day in his gaiest apparel in order to visit an English lady of character and fortune  just as he was stepping into his chariot  a waiting job   he was arrested
