town  A shocking and most terrible        composition for a wife  Yet such will she very speedily be made by        the poor infatuated Mr  Saving  if you  Sir  in your paternal        wisdom  do not find some way to put a stop to his intentions  The        original of the picture I have been representing  is called Miss        Betsy Thoughtless  a name well known among the gallant part of the        town  I hope you will take the above intelligence in good part  as        it is meant  with the greatest sincerity  and attachments to your        interests  by  Sir  your most humble  but unknown servant            A  Z            P S  Sir  your son is every day at Mr  Goodman s  and if you will        take the trouble to set a watch over him  or send any person to        enquire in the neighbourhood  it will be easy for you to satisfy        yourself in the truth of what I have related        The consternation Miss Betsy was in on reading this cruel invective  was   such as for some moments deprived her of the power of speaking  Mr    Saving could neither wonder at  nor blame  so just a resentment  yet    to mitigate it in part  he confessed to her a secret  which  till then    she had been wholly ignorant of        Though nothing  Madam   said he   can excuse the crime she has been   guilty of towards you  yet permit me to acquaint you  that the malice is   chiefly levelled against me  and you are only wounded through my sides         How can that be   cried she   She does justice to your character  while   she defames mine in the most barbarous manner     Mere artifice  Madam     answered he   to work my father to her purpose  as I will presently   convince you        He then told her  that before he ever had the honour of seeing her  he   had treated Miss Flora with some gallantries   Which   said he   her   vanity made her take as the addresses of a serious passion  till those   she found I afterwards made to you convinced her to the contrary  This   Madam   continued he   I am well assured of by her laying hold of every   opportunity to reproach my inconstancy  as she has termed it  Finding   how little I regarded all she said to me on that score  and still   persisted in my devoirs to you  she doubtless had recourse to this most   wicked strategem to cut me off from all hope  even though it had been in   my power to have inclined you to favour my suit        Miss Betsy found this supposition so reasonable  and so conformable to   the temper of Miss Flora  that she agreed with Mr  Saving in it  She did   not now wonder at her wishing to be revenged on him  but could not brook   with patience the method she took for being so  and said  that if Mr    Goodman did not do her justice on the author of so infamous a libel  she   would immediately quit the house  and chuse another guardian        Hold  Madam   said he   I must intreat you will give me leave to remind   you of the consequences that may possibly attend your taking such a   step  I own  with you  that treachery and calumny  such as hers  cannot   be too severely exposed and punished  but  Madam  consider  that in   order to do this  the accident which brought the letter into my   possession  and the opportunity you have allowed me of presenting it to   you  must be made known  the latter of which  you may be confident  she   would not fail to make such representations of  as would not only hurt   me  both with my father and my wife  but also furnish the malicious   world  too apt to judge by appearances  with some pretence for casting a   blemish on your own reputation        These remonstrances has some part of the effect they were intended for   on the mind of Miss Betsy  yet  having an aversion to dissimulation  and   not knowing whether she could be able to conceal either her resentment
