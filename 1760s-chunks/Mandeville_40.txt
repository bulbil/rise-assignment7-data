        1 206       Tuesday  August l7th      To Miss Howard      HOW  my sweet Emily  shall I bear his absence  an absence embittered by the remembrance of those lively impassioned hours which love alone can give  What joy have I found in owning the sentiments of my soul to one so worthy of all my tenderness  Yes  Emily  I love him    words can but ill paint what I feel    he  he alone     yet he leaves Belmont    leaves it by my command  leaves it this very hour  leaves it perhaps for ever    Great Heaven  can I support that thought        If you love  if you pity your unhappy friend  return immediately to Belmont  let me repose my sorrows in that faithful breast  Lady Anne is tenderly my friend  but the sprightliness of her character intimidates me  I do not hope to find in her          1 207       that sweet indulgence to all my faults  as in the gentle soul of my Emily      I have entreated him to take no leave of me  I shall only see him with the family  The moment draws near    my fluttering heart    How shall I hide my concern     Lady Anne is coming to my apartment  I must go with her to the saloon  where he only waits to bid us adieu  his chaise is in the court  Oh  Emily  my emotion will betray me           He is gone  the whole house is in tears  never was a man so adored  never man so infinitely deserved it  He pressed my hand to his lips  his eyes spoke unutterable love  I leaned almost fainting on Lady Anne  and hid my tears in her bosom  she hurried me to my apartment  and left me to give vent to my full heart  She sees my weakness  land kindly strives to hide it from others  whilst her delicacy          1 208       prevents her mentioning it to myself  she has a tender and compassionate heart  and my reserve is an injury to her friendship      Lady Anne has sent to ask me to air  I shall be glad to avoid all eyes but hers  perhaps I may have courage to tell her    she merits all my confidence  nor is it distrust but timidity which prevents    she is here    I am ashamed to see her  Adieu  my dearest  my beloved friend            1 209         To Col  Bellville   Friday Night      WE have lost our lovely Harry  he left us this morning for Lord T     s  Poor Lady Julia  how I adore her amiable sincerity  she has owned her passion to me as we aired  and mentioned hopes which are founded in madness  I ventured gently to remonstrate  but there is no reasoning with a heart in love  Time and absence may effect a cure  I am the confidente of both  I am perplexed how to proceed  I must either betray the trust reposed in me  or abuse my Lord Belmont s friendship and hospitality        In what a false light do we see every thing through the medium of passion  Lady Julia is heiress to 14 000 L   a year  yet          1 210       thinks Harry s merit may raise him to a situation which will justify his pretending to her  and that this stupendous rise may be brought about in a twelvemonth  he too thinks it possible  nay the scheme is his  Heaven and earth  yet they are not fools  and Harry has some knowledge of mankind      At present there is no talking reasonably to either of them  I must soothe them  to bring them off this ruinous inclination by degrees        As idleness is the nurse of love  I will endeavour to keep Lady Julia continually amused  a new lover might do much  but there is nobody near us that is tolerable  indeed the woman who has loved Harry Mandeville  will be somewhat hard to please            1 211          Chance favors my designs  my Lord has proposed a visit of a fortnight to a neighbouring nobleman  Lord Rochdale  whose house is generally full of gay people  his son too  Lord Melvin  with whom I was acquainted abroad  and who is only inferior to Harry Mandeville  is hourly expected from his travels        Since I wrote the last paragraph  an idea has struck me  from a very particular expression in a letter I
