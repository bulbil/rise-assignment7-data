Lady Trusty  the two Mr    Thoughtlesses  and Mrs  Munden  The husband of that lady had also   received an invitation to be one of the guests  but he pretended a   previous engagement would not permit him to accept the favour intended   him       He made his excuse  however  in terms so polite  and seemingly sincere    that none of the company  excepting those who were in the secret of the   disagreement between him and his wife  had any apprehensions that his   absence was occasioned by any other motive that what his message had   expressed       Sir Ralph Trusty and his lady  who were the only persons who had the   least suspicion of the truth of this affair  could not help being a good   deal concerned at it  but they forbore taking any notice  till the   latter  perceiving Mrs  Munden had retired to a window at the farther   end of the room  in order to give herself a little air  stept hastily   towards her  and  in a low voice  accosted her in these terms        I see plainly  my dear   said she   through the excuse your husband has   made for not complying with Mr  Goodman s invitation  and am heartily   sorry to find this fresh proof of the disunion between you  It is high   time something should be attempted to put things on a better footing  I   will desire Sir Ralph to send for Mr  Munden to morrow  and we will try   what can be done         Your ladyship is extremely good   replied the other   and I shall be   always ready to submit to whatever you shall think proper for me  but I   am determined to be entirely passive in this affair  and shall continue   to live with Mr  Munden in the same manner I do at present  till a very   great alteration in his behaviour shall oblige me to think I ought  in   gratitude  to make some change in mine        Lady Trusty would not prolong the conversation  for fear of being   observed  and they both rejoined the company  After this  there passed   nothing of sufficient moment to acquaint the reader with  so that I   shall only say  that  after a day  and great part of the ensuing night    spent in feasting  merriment and all that could exhilarate the spirits   and excite good humour  every one retired to their respective dwellings    highly satisfied with the manner in which they had been entertained by   the younger merchant       Lady Trusty was far from being forgetful of the promise she had made to   her fair friend  and  after a serious consultation with Sir Ralph in   what manner it was most proper to proceed  prevailed upon that   gentleman  who was little less zealous than herself in doing good   offices  to write the following billet to Mr  Munden             To George Munden  Esq            Sir            A business which  I am perfectly well assured  is of the utmost        consequence both to your present and future happiness  obliges me        to intreat the favour of seeing you this morning at my house  it        not being so proper  for reasons I shall hereafter inform you of         for me to wait on you at yours            As I have no other interest in what I have to impart  than merely        the pleasure I shall take in doing you a service  and discharging        what I think the duty of every honest man  I flatter myself you        will not fail of complying immediately with my request  and  at the        same time  believe me to be  what I am  with the greatest        sincerity  Sir  your well wisher  and most humble and most obedient        servant            RALPH TRUSTY        This letter being sent pretty early in the morning  Mr  Munden was but   just out of bed when he received it  a breakfast much less pleasing to   him than his chocolate  He doubted not but his wife had made Lady Trusty   acquainted with the whole secret of his family affairs  and therefore   easily guessed on what score he was sent for in this pressing manner by   Sir Ralph  and
