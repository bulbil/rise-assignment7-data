 murders  punishments  and devastation  the Duke of Orleans was assassinated by the Duke of Burgundy  and he  in his turn  fell by the treachery of the Dauphin  while the son  desiring to revenge his father s death  acknowledged Henry as lawful heir to the crown  and a treaty was concluded between Henry and the young Duke of Burgundy at Troyes  by which he was acknowledged heir to the crown of France  after the death of Charles  who still reigned  though  by his diseases  rendered totally incapable of business  Catharine  the French King s daughter  was given to Henry in marriage  and it was resolved  that the Dauphin should be brought to an account for the murder of the late Duke of Burgundy  Things being adjusted in this manner  Henry entered the city of Paris without opposition  and there conducted the government at his pleasure  while the feeble Charles was attended as a King indeed  but with scarce even the liberty of a subject   The Dauphin  in the mean time  wandered about  a stranger in his own dominions  while Henry returned to London  to raise new subsidies and new troops  to secure his late conquests  His presence  as might be expected  inspired his subjects with joy  but they  at the same time  could not be much pleased with a conquest  which seemed likely to transfer the seat of empire from among them  The parliament  upon various pretences    168 refused him a supply equal to his demands  however  he again set sail with a new raised army  and the Dauphin  upon his appearance  thought fit again to retire  Henry then enters Paris  and  while Charles had but a small court  he was attended with a very magnificent one  On Whitsunday they dined together in public  the two Kings and the two Queens  with their crowns on their heads  Charles  indeed  receiving apparent homage  but Henry commanding with absolute authority  After this he prepared to stop the progress of the enemy  who had already taken some towns  but  whilst he flattered himself with a speedy victory  he was attacked with a fistula  which the physicians were  at that time  too unskilful to treat with judgment  He died at the castle of Vincennes  with the same intrepidity with which he lived  and was buried at Westminster abbey  His reign  during the short time he lived  which was but thirty four years  was rather splendid than serviceable  the treasures of his native country were lavished upon conquests  that to them were unprofitable  His military fame acquired him the reputation of every other good quality  he favoured the clergy  and they have returned the debt to his memory  in general  the good or the erroneous conduct of a Prince appears rather after his death than during his life time  and the successors of imprudent Kings are often taxed with errors not their own  as we shall presently see  He died  however  fortunate  by falling in the midst of his triumphs  and leaving his subjects happy  Charles  who died two months after him  finished a wretched reign  long past in phrenzy  and by all France branded with contempt  leaving the most miserable subjects upon earth   I am   c     169  LETTER XXIII   OUR triumphs  at this time  in France  produced scarce any good effects at home  as we grew warlike  we became brutal  and  panting after foreign possessions  we forgot the arts of cultivating those that lay nearer home  Our language  instead of improving  was daily becoming more barbarous  Langland and Chaucer  about a century before  seemed to have drawn it from obscurity  and enriched it with new terms and combinations  but it was now relapsed into its former grossness  and no poet or historian of note was born in this calamitous period   Henry VI  successor to Henry V  was not quite a year old when he came to the throne  and his relations began  soon after  to dispute the government during his minority  The Duke of Bedford was appointed  by parliament  Protector of England  Defender of the Church  and First Counsellor of the King  his brother  the Duke of Gloucester  was to govern in his absence  while he conducted the French war  but several others aspired at this post as well as he  The second rank in every kingdom  as being the most powerful  is generally the most envied situation  the first step his enemies took to render the Duke of Gloucester odious  was to accuse his wife  the Duchess  of witchcraft  She was charged with conversing with one Sir Roger Bolingbroke  a priest and reputed necromancer  and one Mary Gurdemain  who was said to be a witch  it was asserted  that  with their assistance  she made a figure of the King in wax  this the accusers said was placed before a gentle fire  and  as the wax dissolved  the King s strength was   170 wasted  and  upon its total dissolution  his life would be at an end  This charge Bolingbroke utterly denied  but the Duchess confessed that she had desired
