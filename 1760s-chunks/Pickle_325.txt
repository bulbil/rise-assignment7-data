come to that issue  I  will use my whole interest with the coroner to bring in his verdict  lunacy  that your carcase may have Christian burial    So saying  he withdrew  very well satisfied with the revenge he had  taken  which operated so violently upon Crabtree  that  if it had  not been for the sole consideration mentioned above  he would  in  all probability  have had recourse to the remedy proposed  But his  unwillingness to oblige and entertain his fellow creatures hindered him  from practising that expedient  till  by course of post  he was happily  undeceived with regard to the situation of his affairs  and that  information had such an effect upon him  that he not only forgave our  hero for the stratagem  which he immediately ascribed to the right  author  but also made him a tender of his purse  so that matters for the  present were brought to an amicable accommodation   Meanwhile Peregrine never slacked in his attendance upon the great  he  never omitted to appear upon every levee day  employed his industry and  penetration in getting intelligence of posts that were unfilled  and  every day recommended himself to the good offices of his patron  who  seemed to espouse his interest with great cordiality  nevertheless  he  was always too late in his application  or the place he demanded chanced  to be out of the minister s gift  These intimations  though communicated  in the most warm professions of friendship and regard  gave great  umbrage to the young gentleman  who considered them as the evasions  of an insincere courtier  and loudly complained of them as such to  his lordship  signifying  at the same time  an intention to sell his  mortgage for ready money  which he would expend to the last farthing in  thwarting his honour  in the very first election he should patronize   His lordship never wanted a proper exhortation upon these occasions  He    6 22 15  3 45 PM   did not now endeavour to pacify him with assurances of the minister s  favour  because he perceived that these medicines had  by repeated use   lost their effect upon our adventurer  whose menaces he now combated  by representing that the minister s purse was heavier than that of  Mr  Pickle  that  therefore  should he make a point of opposing his  interest  the youth must infallibly fail in the contest  in which case  he would find himself utterly destitute of the means of subsistence  and  consequently precluded from all hope of provision   This was an observation  the truth of which our young gentleman could  not pretend to doubt  though it did not at all tend to the vindication  of his honour s conduct  Indeed  Pickle began to suspect the sincerity  of his own patron  who  in his opinion  had trifled with his impatience   and even eluded  by sorry excuses  his desire of having another  private audience of the first mover  His lordship also began to be less  accessible than usual  and Peregrine had been obliged to dun the steward  with repeated demands  before he could finger the last quarter of his  interest  Alarmed by these considerations  he went and consulted the  nobleman whom he had obliged in the affair of his son  and had the  mortification to hear but a very indifferent character of the person in  whom he had so long confided  This new adviser  who  though a courtier   was a rival of the other  gave our adventurer to understand  that he had  been leaning upon a broken reed  that his professed patron was a man of  shattered fortune and decayed interest  which extended no farther than  a smile and a whisper  that  for his own part  he should have been proud  of an opportunity to use his influence with the minister in behalf of  Mr  Pickle   But  since you have put yourself under the protection of  another peer   said he   whose connections interfere with mine  I cannot  now espouse your cause  without incurring the imputation of seducing  that nobleman s adherents  a charge which  of all others  I would most  carefully avoid  However  I shall always be ready to assist you with my  private advice  as a specimen of which  I now counsel you to insist upon  having another interview with Sir Steady Steerwell himself  that you  may in person explain your pretensions  without any risk of being  misrepresented  and endeavour  if possible  to draw him into some  particular promise  from which he cannot retract  with any regard to  his reputation  for general profession is a necessary armour worn by all  ministers in their own defence  against the importunity of those whom  they will not befriend  and would not disoblige    This advice was so conformable to his own sentiments  that our  adventurer seized the first opportunity to demand a hearing  and plainly  told his patron  that  if he could not be indulged with that favour  he  should look upon his lordship s influence to be
