confirms me in the same opinion   though I am quite ignorant of the affair  the particulars of which I  should be glad to learn  as well as the genuine account of his own life   many circumstances of which are by his enemies  I believe  egregiously  misrepresented     Sir   answered the priest   that is a piece of satisfaction which I am  glad to find myself capable of giving you  I have had the pleasure of  being acquainted with Mr  M   from his youth  and everything which I  shall relate concerning him  you may depend upon as a fact which hath  fallen under my own cognizance  or been vouched upon the credit of  undoubted evidence    Mr  M   s father was a minister of the established church of Scotland   descended from a very ancient clan  and his mother nearly related to a  noble family in the northern part of that kingdom  While the son was  boarded at a public school  where he made good progress in the Latin  tongue  his father died  and he was left an orphan to the care of an  uncle  who  finding him determined against any servile employment  kept  him at school  that he might prepare himself for the university  with a  view of being qualified for his father s profession    Here his imagination was so heated by the warlike achievements he found  recorded in the Latin authors  such as Caesar  Curtius  and Buchanan   that he was seized with an irresistible thirst of military glory  and  desire of trying his fortune in the army  His Majesty s troops taking  the field  in consequence of the rebellion which happened in the year  seventeen hundred and fifteen  this young adventurer  thinking no life  equal to that of a soldier  found means to furnish himself with a fusil  and bayonet  and  leaving the school  repaired to the camp near Stirling  with a view of signalizing himself in the field  though he was at that  time but just turned of thirteen  He offered his service to several  officers  in hope of being enlisted in their companies  but they would  not receive him  because they rightly concluded  that he was some  schoolboy broke loose  without the knowledge or consent of his  relations  Notwithstanding this discouragement  he continued in camp   curiously prying into every part of the service  and such was the    6 22 15  3 45 PM   resolution conspicuous in him  even at such a tender age  that  after  his small finances were exhausted  he persisted in his design  and   because he would not make his wants known  actually subsisted for  several days on hips  haws  and sloes  and other spontaneous fruits   which he gathered in the woods and fields  Meanwhile  he never failed  to be present  when any regiment or corps of men were drawn out to be  exercised and reviewed  and accompanied them in all their evolutions   which he had learned to great perfection  by observing the companies  which were quartered in the place where he was at school  This eagerness  and perseverance attracted the notice of many officers  who  after  having commended his spirit and zeal  pressed him to return to his  parents  and even threatened to expel him from the camp  if he would not  comply with their advice    These remonstrances having no other effect than that of warning him to  avoid his monitors  they thought proper to alter their behaviour towards  him  took him into their protection  and even into their mess  and  what  above all other marks of favour  pleased the young soldier most   permitted him to incorporate in the battalion  and take his turn of  duty with the other men  In this happy situation he was discovered by a  relation of his mother  who was a captain in the army  and who used all  his authority and influence in persuading M   to return to school  but   finding him deaf to his admonitions and threats  he took him under his  own care  and  when the army marched to Dumblane  left him at Stirling  with express injunctions to keep himself within the walls    He temporized with his kinsman  fearing that  should he seem  refractory  the captain would have ordered him to be shut up in the  castle  Inflamed with the desire of seeing a battle  his relation no  sooner marched off the ground  than he mixed in with another regiment   to which his former patrons belonged  and proceeded to the field   where he distinguished himself  even at that early time of life  by his  gallantry  in helping to retrieve a pair of colours belonging to M  n s  regiment  so that  after the affair  he was presented to the duke of  Argyll  and recommended strongly to Brigadier Grant  who invited him  into his regiment  and promised to provide for him with the first  opportunity  But that gentleman in a
