Mrs  Jewkes s letter  and mine of thanks to Mr  B      Things  I   hope  must be better than you expect  Providence will not desert such   piety and innocence  and be this your comfort and reliance  Which is the   best advice that can at present be given  by                                     Your most faithful humble servant           N  B  The father s letter was as follows           My DEAREST DAUGHTER        Our prayers are at length heard  and we are overwhelmed with joy  O   what sufferings  what trials  hast thou gone through  Blessed be   the Divine goodness  which has enabled thee to withstand so many   temptations  We have not yet had leisure to read through your long   accounts of all your hardships  I say long  because I wonder how you   could find time and opportunity for them  but otherwise they are the   delight of our spare hours  and we shall read them over and over  as   long as we live  with thankfulness to God  who has given us so virtuous   and so discreet a daughter  How happy is our lot in the midst of our   poverty  O let none ever think children a burden to them  when the   poorest circumstances can produce so much riches in a Pamela  Persist    my dear daughter  in the same excellent course  and we shall not envy   the highest estate  but defy them to produce such a daughter as ours        I said  we had not read through all yours in course  We were too   impatient  and so turned to the end  where we find your virtue within   view of its reward  and your master s heart turned to see the folly of   his ways  and the injury he had intended to our dear child  For  to be   sure  my dear  he would have ruined you  if he could  But seeing your   virtue  his heart is touched  and he has  no doubt  been awakened by   your good example        We don t see that you can do any way so well  as to come into the   present proposal  and make Mr  Williams  the worthy Mr  Williams  God   bless him   happy  And though we are poor  and can add no merit  no   reputation  no fortune  to our dear child  but rather must be a disgrace   to her  as the world will think  yet I hope I do not sin in my pride  to   say  that there is no good man  of a common degree   especially as your   late lady s kindness gave you such good opportunities  which you have   had the grace to improve   but may think himself happy in you  But  as   you say  you had rather not marry at present  far be it from us to offer   violence to your inclination  So much prudence as you have shewn in all   your conduct  would make it very wrong in us to mistrust it in this  or   to offer to direct you in your choice  But  alas  my child  what can we   do for you   To partake our hard lot  and involve yourself into as hard   a life  would not help us  but add to your afflictions  But it will be   time enough to talk of these things  when we have the pleasure you now   put us in hope of  of seeing you with us  which God grant  Amen  amen    say  Your most indulgent parents  Amen         Our humblest service and thanks to the worthy Mr  Williams  Again we   say  God bless him for ever        O what a deal we have to say to you  God give us a happy meeting    We understand the  squire is setting out for London  He is a fine   gentleman  and has wit at will  I wish he was as good  But I hope he   will now reform           O what inexpressible comfort  my dear father  has your letter given   me   You ask  What can you do for me   What is it you cannot do for your   child   You can give her the advice she has so much wanted  and still   wants  and will always want  You can confirm her in the paths of virtue    into which you first initiated her  and you
