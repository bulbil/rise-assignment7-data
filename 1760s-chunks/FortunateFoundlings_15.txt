 sooner missed her  than he enquired with a good deal of earnestness for   her  and on mrs  C    ge s telling him she was gone away from her house    became so impatient to know where  and on what account she had left her    that this woman thinking it would be of advantage to her to own the   truth   for she did nothing without that view  turned off the imposition   with a smile  and said  that perceiving the inclinations he had for her    she had sent her upstairs that no other addresses might be a hindrance   to his designs   This pleased him very well  and he ran directly to the   room where he was informed she was  and after some little discourse    which he thought was becoming enough from a person of his condition to   one of her s  began to treat her with freedoms which she could not help   resisting with more fierceness than he had been accustomed to from women   of a much higher rank  but as he had no great notion of virtue    especially among people of her sphere  he mistook all she said or did   for artifice  and imagining she enhanced the merit of the gift only to   enhance the recompence  he told her he would make her a handsome   settlement  and offered  as an earnest of his future gratitude  a purse   of money  The generous maid fired with a noble disdain at a proposal    which she looked on only as an additional insult  struck down the purse   with the utmost indignation and cried  she was not of the number of   those who thought gold an equivalent for infamy  and that mean as she   appeared  not all his wealth should bribe her to a dishonourable action    At first he endeavoured to laugh her out of such idle notions as he   called them  and was so far from being rebuffed at any thing she said    that he began to kiss and toy with her more freely than before  telling   her he would bring her into a better humour  but he was wholly deceived   in his expectations  if he had any of the nature he pretended  for she   became so irritated at being treated in this manner  that she called out   to the servants to come to her assistance  and protected she would not   stay an hour longer in the house if she could not be secured from such   impertinencies  on which he said she was a silly romantic fool  and   flung out of the room       Mrs  C    ge hearing there had been some bustle  came up soon after and   found Louisa in tears  she immediately complained  of mr  B    n s   behaviour to her  and said  tho  she acknowledged herself under many   obligations to her for the favours she had conferred on her  she could   not think of remaining in a place where  tho  she could not say her   virtue had any severe trials  because she had a natural detestation to   crimes of the kind that gentleman and some others had mentioned  yet her   person was liable to be affronted  The milliner  who was surprized to   hear her talk in this manner  but who understood her trade perfectly   well  answered  that he was the best conditioned civil gentleman in the   world   that she did not know how it happened   that she was certain   indeed he loved her  and that it was in his power to make her a very   happy woman if she were inclined to accept his offers   but she would   perswade her to nothing       These kind of discourses created a kind of abhorrence in Louisa  as they   plainly shewed her  what before she had some reason to believe  that she   was in the house of one who would think nothing a crime that she found   it her own interest to promote  However  she thought it would be   imprudent to break too abruptly with her  and contented herself for the   present with encasing her promise that neither mr  B    n  nor any other   person should for the future give her the least interruption of the   like sort       From this day  however  she was continually ruminating how she should   quit her house  without running the risque of disobliging her so far as   not to be employed by her  for tho  she found herself at present free   from any of those importunities to which both by nature and principles   she was so averse  yet she could not answer to herself the continuing in   a place where virtue was treated as a thing of little or no consequence    and where she knew not how soon she might again be subjected
