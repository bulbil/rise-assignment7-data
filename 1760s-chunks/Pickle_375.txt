estate  were now firmly united in an association  against this unfortunate gentleman  mutual deeds were executed among  them  by which many great lordships and estates were given up by the  uncle to persons who had no right to possess them  in order to engage  them to side with him against his nephew  in withholding the unjust  possession of the remainder    These confederates having held several consultations against their  common enemy  and finding that his cause gathered daily strength since  the trial  by the accession of many witnesses of figure and reputation   who had not been heard of before  and that the only chance they had  to prevent the speedy establishment of his right  and their own  destruction  was by stripping Mr  M   of the little money that yet  remained  and by stopping all further resources whereby he might be  enabled to proceed  they therefore came to a determined resolution to  carry that hopeful scheme into execution  and  in pursuance thereof   they have left no expedient or stratagem  how extraordinary or  scandalous soever  unpractised  to distress Mr  A   and that  gentleman  For that end  all the oppressive arts and dilatory expensive  contrivances that the fertile invention of the lowest pettifoggers  of the law could possibly devise  have with dexterity been played off  against them  in fruitless quibbling  and malicious suits  entirely  foreign to the merits of the cause  Not to mention numberless other acts  of oppression  the most extraordinary and unprecedented proceeding  by  means whereof this sham writ of error hath been kept on foot ever since  November  1743  is to me   said the doctor   a most flagrant instance  not only of the prevalency of power and money  when employed  as in the  present case  against an unfortunate helpless man  disabled  as he is   of the means of ascertaining his right  but of the badness of a cause  that hath recourse to so many iniquitous expedients to support it    In a word  the whole conduct of Lord A   and his party  from the  beginning to this time  hath been such as sufficiently manifests that  it could proceed from no other motives than a consciousness of Mr   A   s right  and of their own illegal usurpations  and from a terror of  trusting the merits of their case to a fair discussion by the laws  of their country  and that the intention and main drift of all their  proceedings plainly tends to stifle and smother the merits of the  case from the knowledge of the world  by oppressive arts and ingenious  delays  rather than trust it to the candid determination of an honest  jury  What else could be the motives of kidnapping the claimant  and  transporting him when an infant  of the various attempts made upon his  life since his return  of the attempts to divest him of all assistance  to ascertain his right  by endeavouring so solicitously to prevail on    6 22 15  3 45 PM   Mr  M   to abandon him in the beginning  of retaining an army of counsel  before any suit had been commenced  of the many sinister attempts to  prevent the trial at bar  of the various arts made use of to terrify any  one from appearing as witness for the claimant  and to seduce those who  had appeared  of the shameless  unprecedented  low tricks now practised   to keep him out of the possession of that estate for which he had  obtained the verdict  thereby to disable him from bringing his cause to  a further hearing  and of the attempts made to buy up Mr  M   s debts   and to spirit up suits against him  Is it not obvious from all these  circumstances  as well as from the obstruction they have given to the  attorney general s proceeding to make a report to his majesty on the  claimant s petition to the king for the peerage  which was referred  by his majesty to that gentleman  so far back as 1743  that all their  efforts are bent to that one point  of stifling  rather than suffering  the merits of this cause to come to a fair and candid hearing  and that  the sole consideration at present between them and this unfortunate man  is not whether he is right or wrong  but whether he shall or shall not  find money to bring this cause to a final determination    Lord A   and his confederates  not thinking themselves safe with all  these expedients  while there was a possibility of their antagonist s  obtaining any assistance from such as humanity  compassion  generosity   or a love of justice  might induce to lay open their purses to his  assistance in ascertaining his right  have  by themselves and their  numerous emissaries  employed all the arts of calumny  slander  and  detraction against him  by traducing his cause  vilifying his person   and most basely and cruelly tearing his character to pieces  by a  thousand misrepresentations  purposely invented and industriously  propagated
