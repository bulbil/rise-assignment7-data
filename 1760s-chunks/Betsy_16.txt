no  I ll warrant you they would have found some way or   other to come together before now  and the boy might have been ruined    if I had not been informed by other hands how things were carried on    and put it out of the power of any of you to impose upon me  The girl   may spread her nets to catch some other woodcock  if she can  Thanks to   Heaven  and my own prudence  my son is far enough out of her reach        Mr  Goodman  though one of the best natured men in the world  could not   keep himself from being a little ruffled at the alderman s discourse    and told him  that though he had been far from encouraging Mr  Saving s   inclinations  and should always think it the duty of a son to consult   his father in every thing he did  especially in so material a point as   that of marriage  yet he saw no reason for treating Miss Betsy with   contempt  as she was of a good family  had a very pretty fortune of her   own  and suitable accomplishments        You take a great deal of pains to set her off   said the alderman   and   since you married a court lady not worth a groat  have got all the   romantick idle notions of the other end of the town as finely as if you   had been bred there  A good family   Very pleasant  i faith  Will a good   family go to market  Will it buy a joint of mutton at the butcher s  or   a pretty gown at the mercer s   Then  a pretty fortune  you say  Enough    it may be  to squander away at cards or masquerades for a month or two    She has suitable accomplishments too   Yes  indeed  they are suitable   ones  I believe   I suppose she can sing  dance  and jabber a little   French  but I ll be hanged if she knows how to make a pye  or a pudding    or to teach her maid to do it        The reflection on Lady Mellasin  in the beginning of this speech  so   much incensed Mr  Goodman  that he could scarce attend to the latter   part of it  he forbore interrupting him  however  but  as soon as he had   done speaking  replied in terms which shewed his resentment  In fine    such hot words passed between them  as  had they been younger men  might   have produced worse consequence  but the spirit of both being equally   evaporated in mutual reproaches  they grew more calm  and at last talked   themselves into as good harmony as ever  Mr  Goodman said he was sorry   that he had been prevailed upon  by the young man s intreaties  to keep   his courtship to Miss Betsy a secret  and the alderman begged pardon  in   his turn  for having said any thing disrespectful of Lady Mellasin       On this they shook hands  another half pint of sherry was called for    and  before they parted  the alderman acquainted Mr  Goodman  that to   prevent entirely all future correspondence between his son and Miss   Betsy  he had sent him to Holland some days ago  without letting him   know any thing of his intentions till every thing was ready for his   embarkation   I sent   said he   the night before he was to go  his   portmanteau  and what other luggage I thought he would have occasion   for  to the inn where the Harwich stage puts up  and  making him be   called up very early in the morning  told him he must go a little way   out of town with me upon extraordinary business  He seemed very   unwilling  said he had appointed that morning to meet a gentleman  and   begged I would delay the journey to the next day  or even till the   afternoon  What caused this backwardness I cannot imagine  for I think   it was impossible he could know my designs on this score  but  whatever   was in his head  I took care to disappoint it  I listened to none of his   excuses  nor trusted him out of my sight  but forced him to go with me   to the coach  in which I had secured a couple of places  He was horribly   shocked when he found where he was going  and would fain have persuaded   me to repeal his banishment  as he called it  I laughed in my sleeve    but took no notice of the real motive I had for sending him away  and   told him there was an absolute necessity for his departure  that I had a   business of the greatest
