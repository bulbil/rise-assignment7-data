rest of his wealthy relations   would have suffered him to languish in obscurity and distress  and by  turning his misfortune into reproach  made it a plea for their want of  generosity and friendship   Peregrine  understanding the situation of his friend s affairs  would  have accommodated him upon the instant with a sum to accelerate the  passage of his commission through the offices  but  being too well  acquainted with his scrupulous disposition  to manifest his benevolence  in that manner  he found means to introduce himself to one of the  gentlemen of the War Office  who was so well satisfied with the  arguments used in behalf of his friend  that Godfrey s business was  transacted in a very few days  though he himself knew nothing of his  interest being thus reinforced   By this time  the season at Bath was begun  and our hero  panting with  the desire of distinguishing himself at that resort of the fashionable  world  communicated his design of going thither to his friend Godfrey   whom he importuned to accompany him in the excursion  and leave of  absence from his regiment being obtained by the influence of Peregrine s  new quality friends  the two companions departed from London in a  post chaise  attended  as usual  by the valet de chambre and Pipes  who  were become almost as necessary to our adventurer as any two of his own  organs   At the inn  when they alighted for dinner  Godfrey perceived a person  walking by himself in the yard  with a very pensive air  and  upon  observing him more narrowly  recognised him to be a professed gamester   whom he had formerly known at Tunbridge  On the strength of this  acquaintance  he accosted the peripatetic  who knew him immediately   and  in the fulness of his grief and vexation  told him  that he was  now on his return from Bath  where he had been stripped by a company  of sharpers  who resented that he should presume to trade upon his own  bottom   Peregrine  who was extremely curious in his inquiries  imagining that  he might learn some entertaining and useful anecdotes from this artist     6 22 15  3 45 PM   invited him to dinner  and was accordingly fully informed of all the  political systems at Bath  He understood that there was at London one  great company of adventurers  who employed agents in all the different  branches of imposition throughout the whole kingdom of England  allowing  these ministers a certain proportion of the profits accruing from their  industry and skill  and reserving the greatest share for the benefit of  the common stock  which was chargeable with the expense of fitting  out individuals in their various pursuits  as well as with the loss  sustained in the course of their adventures  Some whose persons and  qualifications are by the company judged adequate to the task  exert  their talents in making love to ladies of fortune  being accommodated  with money and accoutrements for that purpose  after having given their  bonds payable to one or other of the directors  on the day of marriage   for certain sums  proportioned to the dowries they are to receive   Others versed in the doctrine of chances  and certain secret  expediences  frequent all those places where games of hazard are  allowed  and such as are masters in the arts of billiards  tennis   and bowls  are continually lying in wait  in all the scenes of  these diversions  for the ignorant and unwary  A fourth class attend  horse races  being skilled in those mysterious practices by which the  knowing ones are taken in  Nor is this community unfurnished with those  who lay wanton wives and old rich widows under contribution  and extort  money  by prostituting themselves to the embraces of their own sex   and then threatening their admirers with prosecution  But their most  important returns are made by that body of their undertakers who  exercise their understandings in the innumerable stratagems of the card  table  at which no sharper can be too infamous to be received  and even  caressed by persons of the highest rank and distinction  Among other  articles of intelligence  our young gentleman learned  that those  agents  by whom their guest was broke  and expelled from Bath  had  constituted a bank against all sporters  and monopolized the advantage  in all sorts of play  He then told Gauntlet  that  if he would put  himself under his direction  he would return with them  and lay such a  scheme as would infallibly ruin the whole society at billiards  as he  knew that Godfrey excelled them all in his knowledge of that game   The soldier excused himself from engaging in any party of that kind  and  after dinner the travellers parted  but  as the conversation between  the two friends turned upon the information they had received  Peregrine  projected a plan for punishing those villainous pests of society   who prey upon their fellow creatures  and it was put in execution by  Gauntlet in the following manner   CHAPTER LXIX   Godfrey executes a
