of attending you  madam  and this happy family  at tea in the morning —My good Mr  Selby  I had a design upon you  and Mr  Deane  and upon you  young gentleman  to my cousin James  as I told you on the road  but it is now too late  Adieu  till to morrow —He bowed to each  to me profoundly  kissing my hand  and went to his chariot   My uncle whispered my aunt  as we all attended him to that door of the hall which leads into the court yard  to invite him to stay  Hang punctilio  he said   My aunt wanted to speak to Sir Charles  yet  she owned  she knew not what to say  Such a conscious aukwardness had indeed possession of us both  as made us uneasy  We thought all was not right  yet knew not that we were wrong  But when Sir Charles s chariot drove away with him  and we took our seats  and supper was talked of  we all of us shewed dissatisfaction  and my uncle was quite out of humour  He would give a thousand pounds  he said  with all his heart and soul  to find in the morning  Sir Charles  instead of coming hither to breakfast  had set out on his return to London   For my part  Lady G  I could not bear these recriminations  I begged to be excused sitting down to supper  I was not well  and this odd situation added uneasiness to my indisposition  A dissatisfaction  that I find will mingle with our highest enjoyments  Nor   65 were the beloved company I left  happier  They canvassed the matter  with so much good natured earnestness  that the supper was taken away  as it was brought  at a late hour   What  my dear Lady G  in your opinion  should we have done  Were we right  or were we wrong  Over delicacy  as I have heard observed  is underdelicacy  You  my dear  your Lord  our Emily  and Dr  Bartlett  all standing in so well known a degree of relation to Sir Charles Grandison  were our most welcome guests  And was not the brother to be received with equal warmth of respect —O no  Custom  it seems  tyrant custom  and the apprehended opinion of the world obliged us  especially as so much bustle had been made about me  by men so bold  so impetuous  to shew him—Shew him what —In effect  that we had expectations upon him  which we could not have upon the brother and sister  and therefore  because we hoped he would be more near  we were to keep him at the greater distance —What an indirect acknowledgment was this in his favour  were there room for him to doubt  Which  however  there could not be  What would I give  said my aunt to me  this moment  to know his thoughts of the matter   Lucy and Nancy will be here at dinner  so will my grandmamma  She has  with her usual enquiries after my health  congratulated me by this line  sealed up      I long  my best love  to embrace you  on the joyful occasion  I need say no more  than that I think myself at this instant  one of the happiest of women  I shall dine with you to day  Adieu  till then  joy of my heart  my own Harriet      Lucy  in a Billet just now brought  written for herself and Nancy  on the intelligence sent her of Sir Charles s arrival  expresses herself thus     66     Our joy is extreme  Blessings on the man  Blessings attend our Harriet  They must  Sir Charles Grandison brings them with himself  Health now will return to our lovely cousin  We long to see the man of whom we have heard so much  We will dine with you  Tell Sir Charles  before we come  that you love us dearly  It shall make us redouble our endeavours to deserve your love  Your declared friendship  and love of us  will give consequence to     LUCY SELBY    NANCY SELBY   We are now in expectation—My aunt and I  tho  early risers  hurried ourselves to get every thing  that however is never out of order  in higher order  Both of us have a kind of consciousness of defect  where yet we cannot find reason for it  If we did  we should supply it  Yet we are careful that every thing has a natural  not an extraordinary appearance—Ease  with propriety  shall be our aim  My aunt says  that were the King to make us a visit  she is sure she could not have a greater desire to please —I will go down  that I may avoid the appearance of parade and reserve  when he comes   Here  in her closet  again  is your poor Harriet  Surely the determined single state is the happiest of lives  to young women  who have the greatness of mind to be above valuing the admiration and flatteries of the other Sex
