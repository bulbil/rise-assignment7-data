 They said a thousand good things  such as showed at once the sharpness of their wits and the profligacy of their morals  They were all on the broad grin except myself  It was impossible to be butt and marksman too  They each of them shot their bolt at me  and the captain said  Faith  Gil Blas  I would advise you as a friend not to set your wit a second time against the church  the biter may be bit  for you must live some time longer among us  before you are a match for them       CH  IX     A more serious incident   WE lounged about the wood for the greater part of the day  without lighting on any traveller to pay toll for the friar  At length we were beginning to wear our homeward way  as if confining the feats of the day to this laughable adventure  which furnished a plentiful fund of conversation  when we got intelligence of a carriage on the road drawn by four mules  They were coming at a hard gallop  with three outriders  who seemed to be well armed  Rolando ordered the troop to halt  and hold a council  the result of whose deliberations was to attack the enemy  We were regularly drawn up in battle array  and marched to meet the caravan  In spite of the applause I had gained in the wood  I felt an oozing sort of tremour come over me  with a chill in my veins and a chattering in my teeth that seemed to bode me no good  As it never rains but it pours  I was in the front of the battle  hemmed in between the captain and the lieutenant  who had given me that post of honour  that I might lose no time in learning to stand fire  Rolando  observing the low ebb of my animal spirits  looked askew at me  and muttered in a tone more resolute than courtly  Hark ye  Gil Blas  look sharp about you  I give you fair notice  that if you play the recreant  I shall lodge a couple of bullets in your brain  I believed him as firmly as my catechism  and thought it high time not to neglect the hint  so that I was obliged to lay an embargo on the expression of my fears  and to think only of recommending my soul to God in silence   While all this was going on  the carriage and horsemen drew near  They suspected what sort of gentry we were  and guessing our trade by our badge  stopped within gun shot  They had carabines and pistols as well as ourselves  While they were preparing to give us a brisk reception  there jumped out of the coach a well  looking gentleman richly dressed  He mounted a led horse  and put himself at the head of his party  Though they were but four against nine  for the coachman kept his seat on the box  they advanced towards us with a confidence calculated to redouble my terror  Yet I did not forget  though trembling in every joint  to hold myself in readiness for a shot  but  to give a candid relation of the affair  I blinked and looked the other way in letting off my piece  so that from the harmlessness of my fire  I was sure not to have murder to answer for in another world   I shall not give the particulars of the engagement  though present  I was no eye witness  and my fear  while it laid hold of my imagination  drew a veil over the anticipated horror of the sight  All I know about the matter is  that after a grand discharge of musquetry  I heard my companions hallooing Victory  Victory  as if their lungs were made of leather  At this shout the terror which had made a forcible entry on my senses was ejected  and I beheld the four horse men stretched lifeless on the field of battle  On our side  we had only one man killed  This was the renegade parson  who had now filled the measure of his apostasy  and paid for jesting with scapularies and such sacred things  The lieutenant received a slight wound in the arm  but the bullet did little more than graze the skin   Master Rolando was the first at the coach door  Within was a lady of from four to five and twenty  beautiful as an angel in his eyes  in spite of her sad condition  She had fainted during the conflict  and her swoon still continued  While he was fixed like a statue on her charms  the rest of were in profound meditation on the plunder  We began by securing the horses of the defunct  for these animals  frightened at the report of our pieces  had got to a little distance  after the loss of their riders  For the mules  they had not wagged a hair  though the coachman had jumped from his box during the engagement to make his escape  We dismounted for the purpose of unharnessing and loading them with some trunks tied before and behind the carriage  This settled  the captain ordered the lady  who had not yet recovered her faculties  to be set on horseback before the best mounted of the robbers  then  leaving
