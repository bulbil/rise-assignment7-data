hose  which were defiled by sudden sallies or irruptions from the postern of his microcosm  and these were attended with such noisome effluvia  that the Bonzas could not perform the barbal abstersion without marks of abhorrence  The emperor himself was seen to stop his nose  and    90 turn away his head  when he approached him to perform the pedestrian exercise   Here I intended to insert a dissertation on trousers or trunk breeches  called by the Greeks 〈 in non Latin alphabet 〉    〈 in non Latin alphabet 〉  by the Latins braccae laxae  by the Spaniards bragas anchas  by the Italians calzone largo  by the French baut de chausses  by the Saxons braecce  by the Swedes brackor  by the Irish briechan  by the Celtae brag  and by the Japonese bra ak  I could make some curious discoveries touching the analogy between the 〈 in non Latin alphabet 〉 and 〈 in non Latin alphabet 〉  and point out the precise time at which the Grecian women began to wear the breeches  I would have demonstrated that the cingulum muliebre was originally no other than the wife s literally wearing the husband s trousers at certain orgia  as a mark of dominion transferred pro tempore  to the female  I would have drawn a curious    91 parallel between the 〈 in non Latin alphabet 〉 of the Greek  and the shim or middle cloth worn by the black ladies in Guinea  I would have proved that breeches were not first used to defend the central parts from the injuries of the weather  inasmuch as they were first worn by the Orientals in a warm climate  as you may see in Persius  Braccatis illita medis—porticus  I would have shewn that breeches were first brought from Asia to the northern parts of Europe  by the Celtae sprung from the antient Gomanaus  that trousers were wore in Scotland long before the time of Pythagoras  and indeed we are told by Jamblychus  that Abaris  the famous Highland philosopher  cotemporary  and personally acquainted with the sage of Crotona  wore long trousers  I myself can attest the truth of that description  as I well remember the person and habit of that learned mountaineer  I would have explained    92 the reasons that compelled the posterity of those mountaineers to abandon the breeches of their forefathers  and expose their posteriors to the wind  I would have convinced the English antiquaries that the inhabitants of Yorkshire came originally from the Highlands of Scotland  before the Scots had laid aside their breeches  and wore this part of dress  long after their ancestors  as well as the southern Britons were unbreeched by the Romans  From this distinction they acquired the name of Brigantes  quasi Bragantes  and hence came the verb to brag or boast contemptuously  for the neighbours of the Brigantes being at variance with that people  used  by way of contumelious defiance  when they saw any of them passing or repassing  to clap their hands on their posteriors  and cry Brag Brag —I would have drawn a learned comparison between the shield of Ajax and the seven fold    93 breeches of a Dutch skipper  Finally  I would have promulgated the original use of trunk breeches  which would have led me into a discussion of the rites of Cloacina  so differently worshipped by the southern and northern inhabitants of this kingdom  These disquisitions would have unveiled the mysteries that now conceal the orgin  migration  superstition  language  laws  and connexions of different nations—sed nunc non erit his locus  I shall only observe  that Linschot and others are mistaken in deriving the Japonese from their neighbours the Chinese  and that Dr  Kempfer is right in his conjecture  supposing them to have come from Media immediately after the confusion of Babel  It is no wonder  therefore  that being Braccatorum filii  they should retain the wide breeches of their progenitors      94 Having dropped these hints concerning the origin of breeches  I shall now return to the great personage that turned me into this train of thinking  The council of Twenty Eight being assembled in a great hurry  Fika kaka sat about five seconds in silence  having in his countenance  nearly the same expression which you have seen in the face and attitude of Felix on his tribunal  as represented by the facetious Hogarth in his print done after the Dutch taste  After some pause he rose  and surveying every individual of the council through a long tube  began a speech to this effect     Imperial Got hama baba  my ever glorious master  and you  ye illustrious nobles of Japan  Quanbukus  Quos  Days  and Daygos  my fellows and colleagues in the work of administration  it is well known to you all  and they are rascals that deny it  I    95 have watched and fasted for the public weal —By G—d  I have deprived myself of two hours of my natural rest  every night for a week together —Then  I have been so hurried with state affairs  that I could not eat a comfortable meal in a whole fortnight  and what rendered this misfortune the greater  my chief cook had dressed an olio a la Chine —I say an olio  my Lords  such an olio as never appeared before upon a table in Japan—by the Lord
