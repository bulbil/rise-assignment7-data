a fixed and drooping regard   and   again lift his head on high  and open his horrible throat  and prolong   a roar as of distant thunder  for several minutes together      They attempted  but in vain  to convey the carcase from him     he watched it perpetually  and would suffer nothing to touch it    The keeper then endeavoured to tempt him with variety of victuals    but he turned from all that was offered with loathing  They then   put several living dogs into his cage  and these he instantly tore   piecemeal  but left their members on the floor  His passion   being thus inflamed  he would dart his fangs into the boards  and   pluck away large splinters  and again grapple at the bars of his   cage  and seem enraged at his restraint from tearing the world   to pieces      Again  as quite spent  he would stretch himself by the remains   of his beloved associate  and gather him in with his paws  and put         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  319     him to his bosom   and then utter under roars of such terrible   melancholy as seemed to threaten all around  for the loss of his   little playfellow  the only friend  the only companion  that he had   upon earth      For five days he thus languished  and gradually declined  with    out taking any sustenance  or admitting any comfort  till one   morning he was found dead  with his head lovingly reclined on the   carcase of his little friend  They were both interred together    and their grave plentifully watered by the tears of the keeper and   his loudly lamenting family  But to return      When our company were on their way from the Tower to their   lodgings Sir  said Harry  what we have just seen reminds me of   the opinion of my friend Peter Patience  that one who is fearless   cannot be provoked  You saw how that little  teasing  petulant   wretch had the insolence to fly in the face of his benefactor  with    out offending or exciting in him any kind of resentment  True    Harry  for the lion was sensible that his testy companion was little   and impotent  and depended upon him  and had confidence in his   clemency  and therefore he loved him with all his faults  Anger    however  in some cases is not only allowable  but becomes a duty    The scripture says   Be angry  but sin not   We ought to feel   and fear for others   and lust  violence  and oppression of every   sort will excite the indignation of a generous and benevolent   person  though he may not fear for himself      After supper  Harry appeared to ruminate  and said How comes   it  sir  that creatures not endued with reason or conscience shall   yet  in the affections that are peculiarly called humane  exceed even   most of the human species   You have seen that it was the case   between the lion and the little dog      It was the opinion  my Harry  of an ancient philosopher  that   God was the soul and spirit of brutes   and this he judged from   observing that what we call instinct was incomparably wiser  more   sagacious  and more accomplishing for attaining its ends  through    out its sphere of action  than the most perfect human reason  Now   had this philosopher  instead of saying that God was the soul of   brutes  barely alleged that he ruled and dictated within them  he   would not have gone a tittle wide of the truth      God  indeed  is himself the beauty and the benefit of all his   works  As they cannot exist but in him and by him  so his im    pression is upon them  and his impregnation is through them      Though the elements  and all that we know of nature and crea    ture  have a mixture of natural and physical evil  God is  however    throughout  an internal  though often a hidden principle of good    and never wholly departs from his right of dominion and operation   in his creatures   but is  and is alone  the beauty and beneficence    the whole glory and graciousness that can possibly be in them      As the apostle says    The invisible things of God are made mani    fest by the things that are seen   He is the secret and central   light that kindles up the sun  his dazzling representative   and he   lives  enlightens  and comforts in the diffusion of his beams      His
