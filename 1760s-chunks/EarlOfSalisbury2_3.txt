The silence of Reginhald  gave her an occasion of repeating and enforcing her discourse  but her  discourse was directed to an unfriendly ear  The wicked Monk had fixed  his eyes upon an object  which totally diverted his attention from the  Countess  Near her couch there stood a table  on which  among some  female ornaments  was deposited a ring  an ancient and precious jewel   which had long been the distinguishing ornament of her noble house  and  bore its ensigns armorial curiously impressed  The sight of this  instantly suggested a treacherous purpose to the Monk  for which it was  necessary to possess himself of the jewel  His situation was  convenient for seizing it  unnoticed by Ela or her attendant  He watched  a favourable moment to convey it to his bosom  and  having once secured  his prize  he was more at leisure to answer the discourse of the  Countess  to assume some appearance of gravity  and to affect the  dignity and spiritual authority of his function  He declared  that   within their walls  her son could not suffer wrong  but that it was  necessary to send him thither for protection  Nature and the royal  pleasure pointed to his noble kinsman Raymond as his true protector —  The Countess prepared to express her indignation  but with an insolence  which he mistook for grave authority  he warned her to beware of froward  pride       Their liege Lord  he said  had graciously considered her widowed state   and provided relief and comfort — Her hand  her affection  and her  obedience were now due to Lord Raymond  such was the King s command   Heaven had approved his kind purpose  and would not fail to punish that  obstinacy and haughty perverseness  which rejected its blessings         —And darest thou  abandoned and hateful wretch  —thus did the Countess  suffer her virtuous anger to break forth       Darest thou profane the name of heaven  art thou devoted to its service   and dost thou flatter the baseness  and wouldst thou promote the lewd  purposes of him who hath renounced its laws  and defies its vengeance         — Thy obstinacy be upon thine own head   This was the reply of  Reginhald  who was hardened against all reproof  and impatient to seek  his brother  He turned away in sullen disdain  and left the Countess in  wonder and just resentment at his brutal insolence  nor did this  interview tend to allay the fears and suspicions of a fond mother       If the oppression of Lord Raymond could have its ministers and  favourers among the professed votaries of religion  where might  innocence find refuge  or where seek its just redress         She now dreaded that the sacred privileges of sanctaury might not find  the due regard  as her enemy seemed to have corrupted the reverend  brethren  and to have gained them over to his wicked purposes   She wished she had contended with her malady  and accompanied her son   again she wished she had not rashly entrusted him to false and  treacherous guardians       Her presence might have proved a sufficient protection to him  Raymond  could not dare openly to have raised his arm against him  and surely the  outrage and usurpation of this Lord could not long be concealed         —Thus did she condemn her conduct  and torment her soul with gloomy and  terrible imaginations  tho  yet unacquainted with the dangers and  distress now prepared for herself and her son                  SECT  II     REGINHALD had sought his brother  and recounted all his interview with  Ela  Grey still accused him of violence and turbulence  and urged the  necessity of well timed dissimulation  of art  caution  and smooth  address  The Monk was provoked at this affectation of superior wisdom   and instead of retorting his reproof  displayed the stolen jewel  in  silent and contemptuous triumph  Grey was too well versed in the arts of  fraud and mischief  not to conceive at once  that this ring was to be  used for deceiving the brethren of the monastery  or abusing Oswald  as  occasions might require  by pretended orders and directions from the  Countess  He viewed it eagerly  and regarded it   not without reason  as  an instrument of his purposes  too important to be intrusted wholly to  the violent hands of Reginhald  He commended his zeal and address  which  he  confidently promised  should  in due time  meet their full reward   he invited him to refreshment  reminded him of his satigue  and that the  hour of rest approached  he promised that by the dawn of morning  he  himself would be ready to accompany him to the monastery  where he made  no doubt of happily accomplishing their purposes  and laying a firm  foundation of their future fortunes  Reginhald yielded
