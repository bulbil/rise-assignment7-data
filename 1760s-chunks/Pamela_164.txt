    Wednesday morning       My master sent me a message just now  that he was so much better  that   he would take a turn  after breakfast  in the chariot  and would have me   give him my company  I hope I shall know how to be humble  and comport   myself as I should do  under all these favours       Mrs  Jewkes is one of the most obliging creatures in the world  and I   have such respects shewn me by every one  as if I was as great as Lady   Davers  But now  if this should all end in the sham marriage   It cannot   be  I hope  Yet the pride of greatness and ancestry  and such like    is so strongly set out in Lady Davers s letter  that I cannot flatter   myself to be so happy as all these desirable appearances make for me    Should I be now deceived  I should be worse off than ever  But I shall   see what light this new honour will procure me   So I ll get ready  But   I won t  I think  change my garb  Should I do it  it would look as if I   would be nearer on a level with him  and yet  should I not  it might be   thought a disgrace to him  but I will  I think  open the portmanteau    and  for the first time since I came hither  put on my best silk   nightgown  But then that will be making myself a sort of right to the   clothes I had renounced  and I am not yet quite sure I shall have no   other crosses to encounter  So I will go as I am  for  though ordinary    I am as clean as a penny  though I say it  So I ll e en go as I am    except he orders otherwise  Yet Mrs  Jewkes says  I ought to dress   as fine as I can   But I say  I think not  As my master is up  and at   breakfast  I will venture down to ask him how he will have me be       Well  he is kinder and kinder  and  thank God  purely recovered   How   charmingly he looks  to what he did yesterday  Blessed be God for it       He arose  and came to me  and took me by the hand  and would set me down   by him  and he said  My charming girl seemed going to speak  What would   you say   Sir  said I   a little ashamed   I think it is too great an   honour to go into the chariot with you  No  my dear Pamela  said he  the   pleasure of your company will be greater than the honour of mine  and so   say no more on that head       But  sir  said I  I shall disgrace you to go thus  You would grace a   prince  my fair one  said the good  kind  kind gentleman  in that dress    or any you shall choose  And you look so pretty  that  if you shall not   catch cold in that round eared cap  you shall go just as you are  But    sir  said I  then you ll be pleased to go a bye way  that it mayn t be   seen you do so much honor to your servant  O my good girl  said he  I   doubt you are afraid of yourself being talked of  more than me  for I   hope by degrees to take off the world s wonder  and teach them to expect   what is to follow  as a due to my Pamela       O the dear good man  There s for you  my dear father and mother   Did   I not do well now to come back   O could I get rid of my fears of this   sham marriage   for all this is not yet inconsistent with that frightful   scheme   I should be too happy       So I came up  with great pleasure  for my gloves  and now wait his kind   commands  Dear  dear sir  said I to myself  as if I was speaking to him    for God s sake let me have no more trials and reverses  for I could not   bear it now  I verily think       At last the welcome message came  that my master was ready  and so I   went down as fast as I could  and he  before all the servants  handed me   in  as if I was a lady  and then came in himself  Mrs  Jewkes begged he
