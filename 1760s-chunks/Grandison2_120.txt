way  and lively she was  notwithstanding her trial so lately over  led me into talking of the detested masquerade  She put me upon recollecting the giddy scene  which those dreadfully interesting ones that followed it  had made me wish to blot out of my memory   I spared you at the time  Harriet  said she  I asked you no questions about the masquerade  when you flew to us first  poor frighted bird  with all your gay plumage about you   I coloured a deep crimson  I believe  What were Sir Charles s first thoughts of me  Lucy  in that fantastic  that hated dress  The simile of the bird too  was his  you know  and Charlotte looked very archly   My dear Miss Grandison  spare me still  Let me   300 forget  that ever I presumptuously ventured into such a scene of folly   Do not call it by harsh names  Miss Byron  said Sir Charles  We are too much obliged to it   Can I  Sir Charles  call it by too harsh a name  when I think  how fatal  in numberless ways  the event might have proved  But I do not speak only with reference to that  Don t think  my dear Miss Grandison  that my dislike to myself  and to this foolish diversion  springs altogether from what befel me  The same shocking villainy might have been attempted by the same vile man from a more laudable and reasonable diversion  I had on the spot the same contempts  the same disdain of myself  the dislike of all those who seemed capable of joy on the light  the foolish occasion   My good Charlotte  said Sir Charles smiling  is less timorous than her younger sister  She might be persuaded  I fancy  to venture—  Under your conduct  Sir Charles  You know  Lady L  and I  who have not yet had an opportunity of this sort  were trying to engage you against the next subscription ball   Indeed  said Lady L  our Harriet s distress has led me into reflexions I never made before on this kind of diversion  and I fancy her account of it  will perfectly satisfy my curiosity   Sir Ch  Proceed  good Miss Byron  I am as curious as your sisters  to hear what you say of it  The scene was quite new to you  You probably expected entertainment from it  Forget for a while the accidental consequences  and tell us how you were at the time amused   Amused  Sir Charles —Indeed I had no opinion of the diversion  even before I went  I knew I should despise it  I knew I should often wish myself at home before the evening were over  And so indeed I did  I whispered my cousin Reeves more than once  O madam    301 this is sad  This is intolerable stuff  This place is one great bedlam  Good Heaven▪ Could there be in this one town so many creatures devoid of reason  as are here got together  I hope we are all here   Yet you see  said Miss Grandison  however Lady L  is  or seems to be  instantaneously informed  there were two  who would gladly have been there  The more  you may be sure  for its having been a diversion prohibited to us  at our first coming to town  Sir Charles lived long in the land of masquerades—Oh  my dear  we used to please ourselves with hopes  that when he was permitted to come over to England  we should see golden days under his auspices   Sir Ch   smiling  Will you accompany us to the next subscription ball  Miss Byron   I  Sir Charles  should be inexcusable  if I thought—  Miss Gr   interrupting  and looking archly  Not under our brother s conduct  Harriet   Indeed  my dear Miss Grandison  had the diversion not been prohibited  had you once seen the wild  the senseless confusion  you would think just as I do  And you would have one stronger reason against countenancing it by your presence  for who  at this rate  shall make the stand of virtue and decorum  if such Ladies as Miss Grandison and Lady L  do not —But I speak of the common masquerades  which I believe are more disorderly  I was disgusted at the freedoms taken with me  tho  but the common freedoms of the place  by persons who singled me from the throng  hurried me round the rooms  and engaged me in fifty idle conversations  and to whom  by the privilege of the place  I was obliged to be bold  pert  saucy  and to aim at repartee and smartness  the current wit of that witless place  They once got me into a country dance  No prude could come  or if she came  could be a prude  there   Sir Ch  Were you not pleased  Miss Byron  with the first coup d oeil of that gay apartment     302 A momentary pleasure  but when I came to reflect  the bright light  striking on my tinsel dress  made me seem to myself the more conspicuous fool
