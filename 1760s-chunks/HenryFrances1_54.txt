to communicate their Ideas  rather by Intuition than Converse     Your Expression of amorous to retain is fine  and one Instance  among many in your Writings  of that poetical Elegance  which you allude to   I am not prepared to enter into a Treatise upon the Subject you have started  but shall throw together a few unconnected Hints  after the Manner of a Common Place Book  which is the only Way I can have Patience to write in   Religion may be considered but as moral Virtue  reduced to Method  as human Laws are but a Compendium of Equity  Moral Virtue  its Truth  and Beauty  like the Rays of the Sun  are too weak and diffuse for many  the best Purposes of Life  but Religion  like a Burning Glass  collects those scattered Rays  giving them united Force  and more particular Direction   From the Light of Nature a few ingenious Philosophers might have deduced  perhaps  the Whole of revealed Ethics  but their Writings could have but a flight and confined Influence over the Generality of Mankind  Reasoning may convince our Minds  but human Nature requires Authority to govern and controul its Actions  Rewards and Punishments are not clear from the Light of Nature  tho  they may   186 be presumed from the Analogy running thro  all the Works of Providence  The Time  at least  could not be ascertained   till Revelation denounced it to be immediately consequent of our Death  so that  before that Revelation  Men might  perhaps  presume upon the Possibility of some farther State of Probation  Nay  what Certainty of an Hereafter  upon any Terms  could we have  without Revelation   One great Comfort  in this frail mortal Life  was wanting from the Reasonings of Natural Religion  which the Christian System has assured us of  namely  Remission upon Repentance  and this has  not only  informed us of one darling Attribute more in the Godhead  but has saved Sinners from the Misery and Danger of Despair   Why the great God has thought proper to make his Revelations so partially  both with Regard to Time and Place  in such and such a Manner  the Mystery of the Incarnation  the Passion  with other Articles of Faith  are too abstruse to enter into here  Besides  they more properly belong to  what they call  systematical Divinity  and I shall let them rest   till I am at Leisure to recommend proper Books for your Reading  to instruct you in such speculative Subjects  So having sufficiently answered as much of this Matter  as your Letter required  I shall only add this short Prayer    That we   187 may both live in Hope  that we may die in Certainty     Adeiu   LETTER CIII   My dear CONFESSOR   I Received your s  but it has not answered my Expectations  tho  you say it has answered my Letter  Now I forget how fully I expressed myself there  but I know I had more in Contemplation  when I wrote  than you have taken Notice of  and pray observe  there is a great Difference between answering a Question  and solving a Difficulty   I remember La Bruyere gives the Character of a famous French Wit  who made it a Rule with himself  never to seem posed  upon any Occasion whatsoever  and being asked  a little abruptly  once  What was the Difference between Dryads and Hamadryads  answered very readily    You have heard of your Bishops and Archbishops     I had this Story from yourself some Time ago  upon somewhat a similar Occasion  and I must therefore confess the Pertness of my Re application  and  by Way of Apology for it  I shall add the old Proverb  That a Fool may ask more Questions  than a wise Man can answer  However  I acknowledge  that you have said   188 enough to loosen the Difficulty  tho  not intirely to resolve it  and  for the rest  I am satisfied to throw myself upon Faith   Adieu   Frances   LETTER CIV   Dear FANNY   I Have read Tom Jones at your Request  and return it to you with my Opinion upon it  which you likewise require   The Novel is a true Copy of human Life  the Characters thoroughly kept up to  the Story well told  the Incidents humourous  the Sentiments noble  and the Reflections just and moral   The only Fault I find with the Author is  the ill judged Attempts he often makes to be witty  which being by no Means his Talent  and  in a Work of this Kind  wholly unnecessary  he is therefore inexcusable  if it should turn out  as it frequently does here  in poor Allusions  bald Conceits  or wretched Puns   Adieu   Henry   LETTER CV  HENRY to FRANCES   MY not hearing from you these two Posts shall be no Reason for my not writing to   189 you  for I do it for the Pleasure I have in addressing you  after any Manner  not because I think myself under a Necessity of answering you   You may remember
