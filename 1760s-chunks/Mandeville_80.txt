          2 174         To Col  Bellville   Tuesday Morning      YOUR letter  my dear Bellville  gave me all the consolation it is possible to receive amidst such a scene of wretchedness and despair  the tender sympathy of pitying friendship is the best balm for every woe        The delicacy with which you decline mentioning a subject so improper for the time  would encrease my esteem for you  if that was possible  I know the goodness  the tender sensibility of your heart  too well  to doubt your approving my resolution to give six months to the memory of my angelic friend  and the sad task of endeavoring to soften the sorrows of her parents  Her dying voice adjured me not          2 175       to leave them to their despair  I will not forget the sad task her friendship imposed      The agony of Lady Belmont s grief begins to give place to a sorrow more reasonable  though  perhaps  not less exquisite  The violence of her emotions abates  she still weeps  but her air is more calm  she raises her eyes to Heaven  but it is with a look of patient resignation  which  whilst it melts my soul to behold  gives me hopes she will not sink under her afflictions  Lord Belmont struggles with his own grief  lest it should encrease hers  he attempts to comfort her  he begs her  with an irresolute air  to consider the hand from whence the stroke proceeded  unable to go on  his voice trembles  his bosom swells with unutterable anguish  he rises  he leaves the room  the tears trickle down his reverend cheeks            2 176          These  Bellville  these are the scenes I have perpetually before my eyes        Colonel Mandeville indulges his sorrow alone  shut up continually in his apartment  a prey to silent distress  he seems to fly from all human converse  if entreated  he joins our sad party a moment  he enters with a dejected air  his eyes are bent earnestly to the ground  he sits motionless  inattentive  absorbed in reflexion on his own misery  then  starting up  exclaims   All else I could have borne   and retires to give himself up to his despair        I am now convinced Emily Howard deserved that preference Lady Julia gave her over me in her heart  of which I once so unjustly complained  I lament  I regret  but am enough myself to reason  to reflect  Emily Howard can only weep            2 177          Far from being consoled for the loss of her lovely friend  by the prospect of inheriting Lord Belmont s fortune  to which after Colonel Mandeville she is intitled  she seems incapable of tasting any good in life without her  Every idea of happiness her gentle mind could form included Lady Julia s friendship  with her she wished to spend all her days  she was all to her tender Emily  without her she finds the world a desart        She is changed beyond conception by her grief  a grief which has not a moment s intermission  the almost dying paleness of her cheeks is a witness of the excess of her affliction  yet this very paleness has a thousand charms  her distress has something in it unspeakably lovely  adorned by sorrow  she puts me in mind of what Young describes woman in general           2 178              So properly the object of affliction  That Heaven is pleased to make distress become her  And dresses her most amiably in tears    Tuesday Evening      Bellville  I have been walking in a little wilderness of flowering shrubs once peculiarly happy in Lady Julia s favor  there is a rose which I saw planted by her hand  it still flourishes in youthful bloom  whilst she  the fairest flower Heaven ever formed  lies cropped by the cruel hand of Death        What force has the imagination over the senses  How different is the whole face of nature in my eyes  The once smiling scene has a melancholy gloom  which strikes a damp through my inmost soul  I look in vain for those vivid beauties which once charmed me  all beauty died with Lady Julia            2 179          In this spot  where we have so often walked together  I give way to all the voluptuousness of sorrow  I recall those happy days which are never to return  a thousand tender ideas rush on my memory  I recollect those dear moments of confidence and friendship engraved for ever on my heart  I still hear the sweet accents of that voice  still behold
