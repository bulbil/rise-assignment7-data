beautiful Cashmirian  She was alone with an old slave devoted to her wishes  They helped each other to unroll their precious bale of goods  and Farrukhnaz  at the sight of her consignment  set up such an alarm of delight  as exhibited the woman of the East  without for getting her prurient propensities  With all my natural bias towards adventure  I could not recognize myself as at once transported into the private apartment of the women  without something like an inauspicious damp upon my joy  The lady was aware of my feelings  and anxious to dissipate the unpleasant part of them  Young man  said she  you have nothing to fear  Soliman is just gone to his country house  he is safely lodged for the day  so that we shall be able to entertain one another here at our ease   Hints like these rallied my scattered spirits  and gave a cast to my countenance which confirmed the speculation of the favourite  You have won my heart  pursued she  and it is in my contemplation to soften the severity of your bondage  You seem to be worthy of the sentiments which I have conceived for you  Though disguised under the garb of a slave  your air is noble  and your physiognomy of a character to recommend you to the good graces of a lady  Such an exterior must belong to one above the common  Unbosom yourself to me in confidence  tell me who you are  I know that captives of superior condition and family disguise their real circumstances  to be redeemed at a lower rate  but you have no inducement to practise such a deception on me  and it would even be a precaution revolting to my designs in your favour  since I here pledge myself for your liberty  Deal with sincerity  therefore  and own to me at once that you are a youth of illustrious rank  In good earnest then  madam  answered I  it would ill become me to repay your generous partiality with dissimulation  You are absolutely bent upon it  that I should entrust you with the secret of my quality  and commands like yours are not to be questioned or resisted  I am the son of a Spanish grandee  And so it might actually have been  for anything that I know to the contrary  at all events  the sultana gave me credit for it  so that with considerable self congratulation  at having fixed her regard on a gentleman of some little figure in the world  she assured me that it only depended on herself  whether or no we should meet pretty often in private  In fact  we were no niggards of our mutual good will at the very first approaches  I never met with a woman who was more what a man wishes her to be  She was besides an expert linguist  above all in Castilian  which she spoke with fluency and purity  When she conceived it to be time for us to part  I got by her order into a large osier basket  with an embroidered silk covering of her own manufacture  then the two slaves who had brought me in were called  to carry me out as a present from the favourite to her deluded lord  for under this pretence it is easy to screen any amorous exports from the inspection of the officers entrusted with the superintendence of the women   As for Farrukhnaz and myself  we were not slack in other devices to bring us together  and that lovely captive inspired me by degrees with as much love as she herself entertained for me  Our good understanding was kept a profound secret for full two months  notwithstanding the extreme difficulty in a seraglio of veiling the mysteries of love for any length of time from those uninitiated  whose eyes are jaundiced by their own disqualification  Neither was the discovery made at last by the means of envious spies  An unlucky chance disconcerted all our little arrangements  and the features of my fortune were at once aggravated into a frown  One day when I had been introduced into the presence of the sultana  in the body of an artificial dragon  invented as a machine for a spectacle  while we were parleying most amicably together  Soliman  to whom we had given credit for having gone out of town  made his unwelcome appearance  He entered so abruptly into his favourite s apartment  as scarcely to leave time for the old slave to give us notice of his approach  Still less was there any opportunity to conceal me  Thus therefore  with all my enormities on my head  was I the first object which presented itself to the astonished eyes of the bashaw   He seemed considerably startled at the sight  and his countenance flashed with indignation on the instant  I considered myself as a wretch just hovering on the brink of the grave  and death seemed arrayed in all the paraphernalia of torture  As for Farrukhnaz  it was very evident  in good truth  that she was miserably frightened  but instead of owning her crime and imploring pardon  she said to Soliman  My lord  before you pronounce my sentence  be pleased to hear my defence  Appearances  doubtless  condemn me  and it must strike you that I have committed an act of treason  worthy the most dreadful punishments  It is true  I have
