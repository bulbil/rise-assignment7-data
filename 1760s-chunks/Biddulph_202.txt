 but I am afraid he will never recover the use of his hand  though  as it is not painful  it seems not to give him any uneasiness — April 10 I am infinitely charmed with the conversation of this couple  for the girl is very sensible  and prettily accomplished  I wish she were married to some honest man that knew her value  for I find she has still terrors on Mr Ware’s account  nor is her father without his apprehensions   He said to me to day  if I were to die  Madam  I would conjure    you as my last request to take my daughter into your service  With such a pattern before her she must be virtuous  and with such a protector I am sure she would be safe   I told him he might rely on me  but that I hoped he would live long enough to see her happily disposed of in marriage   If I could see that day  said he  I should then have no other worldly care to disturb me   Here  my dearest Cecilia  I will close my very long narrative  The pacquet is already swelled to an enormous size  but you never think them too large   May 14  After so many trifles  my dear  as my journal for nearly a month past contained  you will be glad of something a little more serious  I mentioned in my last week’s journal  that I had cast my eyes on a young man  who I thought would make a suitable match for Miss Price  if he were approved of by her  and her father  This person is a linen draper in the Strand  a second brother of my Patty’s  You can’t have forgot Harry Main  my dear  whom we both knew as a boy  remarkable for his sober behaviour  modesty  and sweetness of temper  He is just now out of his time  and his eldest brother has set him up in a handsome shop  You may be sure I am his customer  ’Tis on this lad then that I have turned my thoughts  as a fit husband for the amiable girl  I went yesterday morning to buy some linen for Miss Price  and carried her with me  as I had done once or twice before  After we made our markets  I told young Main  with a freedom which a long acquaintance gave me  that I thought he was so well settled  he wanted nothing but a good wife to complete his happiness  He replied  he should think himself very happy if he could light on some good young woman as a partner for life  Why do you not look out for one  said I  They are not so hard to be come at  I believe  Madam  he answered  I must get some one else to do it for me  my friends laugh at me and say I am too bashful to speak for myself  but I fancy were I to meet with a person that really touched my heart  I should make a shift to find courage enough to tell her so   And have you never yet seen such a person  said I  He blushed  and by an involuntary motion his eyes were turned on Miss Price  of whom I concluded his sister Patty  as she often visits him  had given him the history  He said if I commanded him to tell his secret  I should know it another time     This was enough  I asked in a jocose way  would he take a wife of my chusing  Sooner than of any body’s in the world  Madam  he replied   We took our leave  and I asked Patty when I went home  whether she had ever mentioned any thing about Miss Price to her brother  Poor Patty coloured for fear she had committed a fault  but owned directly she had told him every circumstance of her story  her brother having been very inquisitive about her  from the first time he had seen her with me  and added  that she believed he was down right in love with her   I told her if Miss Price liked her brother  and her father did not disapprove the match  I saw no reason why they might not make each other happy  as I should give Miss Price a fortune worth a young man’s acceptance   Patty said  she was sure her brother would rejoice at the offer  and that she herself could not wish him to make a better choice   It only remained now to know how the young lady herself stood affected towards him  I put Patty  for whom Miss Price had conceived a great affection  upon this task  I thought she would speak her mind with less reserve to her  as I feared the obligation she thought herself under to me  might have such an influence on her gratitude  as to prevent that freedom which I wished her to use  for I was resolved not to put the least shadow of constraint on her inclinations   Patty succeeded so well  that without seeming to have any design in it  she drew a confession from Miss Price very much in her brother’s favour   Being now sure that the young people liked each other  I thought
