complaints from my lips  to you only  my second self  shall I utter them  to you I am bound by solemn promise  and reciprocal confidence  to disclose the inmost secrets of my soul  and with you they are as safe as in my own breast — I am once more composed  and determined on my behaviour  I have not a doubt remaining of Mr Arnold’s infidelity  but let me not aggravate my own griefs  nor to a vicious world justify my husband’s conduct  by bringing any reproach on my own  The silent sufferings of the injured  must  to a mind not ungenerous  be a sharper rebuke than it is in the power of language to inflict   But this is not all  I must endeavour  if possible  to skreen Mr Arnold from censure  I hope his own imprudence may not render these endeavours ineffectual  I am resolved not to drop my acquaintance with Mrs Gerrarde  While we continue upon a footing of seeming intimacy  the frequent visits  which I am sure Mr Arnold makes at her house  will be less taken notice of   How Sir George would triumph at the knowlege of Mr Arnold’s deviating from virtue  How my poor mother would be amazed and afflicted  But I will  as far as lies in my power  disappoint the malice of my stars  my mother shall have no cause to grieve  nor my brother to rejoice  the secret shall die with me in my own bosom  and I will wait patiently  till the hand of time applies a remedy to my grief —Mrs Gerrarde sent a message to enquire how I did  Conscious woman  she would not come herself  though she knew not I had discovered her   My dear good lady V—— hurried to see me the instant she had breakfasted  Mr Faulkland had told her of my disaster  and her tenderness soothed and comforted me much  She sat by my bed side two hours  and her discourse alleviated the pain both of my mind and body  but now she has left me  I must again recur to the subject that wrings my heart  Mr Arnold is enslaved to one of the most artful of her sex  I look upon his attachment to be the more dangerous  as I believe it is the first of the kind he ever had  and no woman was ever more formed to please and to deceive  than she who now holds him in her chains  Into what hands am I fallen  Mrs Gerrarde must have heard my story  and by the hint I heard her drop  what cruel misrepresentations may she have made to Mr Arnold  Mr Faulkland     she can have no enmity to  but me she certainly hates  for she has injured me   ’Tis noon  I have not seen Mr Arnold since morning  he has been abroad ever since he rose  Good God  is this the life I am condemned to lead   A new scene of affliction is opened to me  surely my fate is drawing towards a crisis  Mr Arnold has just left me  What conversation have we had   After entering my room  he walked about for some minutes without speaking  at last stopping short  and fixing his eyes upon me  How long have you  said he  been acquainted with Mr Faulkland  I told him my acquaintance began with him some months before I was married  He was once your lover I am informed  He was  and a treaty of marriage was concluded on between us  You would have been happier perhaps  madam  if it had taken place  I do not think so Mr Arnold  you have no reason to suppose I do  I had a very great objection to Mr Faulkland  and obeyed my mother willingly  when she forbid me to see him  I ask not what that objection was  said he  but I suppose  madam  you will without reluctance obey me  if I make the same request to you  Most chearfully  you cannot make a request with which I should more readily comply  But let me beseech you  Mr Arnold  to tell me  what part of my behaviour has given you cause to think such a prohibition necessary  I do not say  answered Mr Arnold  that I have any suspicion of your virtue  but your acquiescence in this particular is necessary to my peace and your own honour  A lady’s being married does not cut off the hopes of a gay man  You give me your promise that you will not see him any more  I do  said I  I will give up lady V——  whose acquaintance I so much esteem  I will go no more to her house while Mr Faulkland continues there  and I know of no other family  where I visit  that he is acquainted with   My pride would not suffer me to enquire where he had got his information  I already knew it too well  and fearing he would rather descend to an untruth than tell me his author  I declined any farther questions  He seemed satisfied with my promise  but quickly left me  as if the whole end of his visit to me was accomplished in having obtained it   September 8  What painful minutes
