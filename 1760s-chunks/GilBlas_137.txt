the effects of his other ablutions  and the labours of the toilette were to be closed  by pencilling every remaining hair in the disforested domain of his whiskers  pericranium  and eyebrows  No old dowager  with a purse to buy a second husband  ever took more pains to assure herself by the cultivation of her charms  that the person and not the fortune should be the object of attraction  The assassin stab of time was parried by the quart and tierce of art  Just as he had done making himself up  in came another old fogram of his acquaintance  by name the Count of Asumar  This genius made no secret of his grey locks  leant upon a stick  and seemed to plume himself on his venerable age instead of wishing to appear in the hey day of his prime  Signor Pacheco  said he as he came in  I am come to take pot luck with you to day  You are always welcome  count  rejoined my master  No sooner said than done  they embraced with a thousand grimaces  took their seats opposite to one another  and began chatting till dinner was served   Their conversation turned at first upon a bull feast which had taken place a few days before  They talked about the cavaliers  and who among them had displayed most dexterity and vigour  whereupon the old count  like another Nestor  whom present events furnish with a topic of expatiating on the past  said with a deep drawn sigh  Alas  where will you meet with men now a days  fit to hold a candle to my contemporaries  The public diversions are a mere bauble  to what they were when I was a young man  I could not help chuckling in my sleeve at my good lord of Asumar s whim  for he did not stop at the handywork of human invention  Would you believe it  At table  when the fruit was brought in  at the sight of some very fine peaches  this ungrateful consumer of the earth s produce exclaimed  In my time  the peaches were of a much larger size than they are now  but nature sinks lower and lower from day to day  If that is the case  said Don Gonzales with a sneer  Adam s hot house fruit must have been of a most unwieldy circumference   The Count of Asumar staid till quite evening with my master  who had no sooner got rid of him  than he sallied forth with me in his train  We went to Euphrasia s  who lived within a stone s throw of our house  and found her lodged in a style of the first elegance  She was tastefully dressed  and for the youthfulness of her air might have been taken to be in her teens  though thirty bonny summers at least had poured their harvests in her lap  She had often been reckoned pretty  and her wit was exquisite  Neither was she one of your brazen faced jilts  with nothing but flimsy balderdash in their talk  and a libertine forwardness in their manners  here was modesty of carriage as well as propriety of discourse  and she threw out her little sallies in the most exquisite manner  without seeming to aspire beyond natural good sense  Oh heaven  said I  is it possible that a creature of so virtuous a stamp by nature should have abandoned herself to vicious courses for a livelihood  I had taken it for granted  that all women of light character carried the mark of the beast upon their foreheads  It was a surprise therefore to see such apparent rectitude of conduct  neither did it occur to me that these hacks for all customers could go at any pace  and assume the polish of well bred society  to impose upon their cullies of the higher ranks  What if a lively petulance should be the order of the day  they are lively and petulant  Should modesty take its turn in the round of fashion  nothing can exceed their outward show of prudent and delicate reserve  They play the comedy of love in many masks  and are the prude  the coquette  or the virago  as they fall in with the quiz  the coxcomb  or the bully   Don Gonzales was a gentleman and a man of taste  he could not stomach those beauties who call a spade a spade  Such were not for his market  the rites of Venus must be consummated in the temple of Vesta  Euphrasia had got up her part accordingly  and proved by her performance that there is no comedy like that of real life  I left my master  like another Numa with his Egeria  and went down into a hall  where whom should fortune throw in my way but an old abigail  whom I had formerly known as maid of all  work to an actress  The recognition was mutual  So  well met once more  Signor Gil Blas  said she  Then you have turned off Arsenia  just as I have parted with Constance  Yes  truly  answered I  it is a long while ago since I went away  and exchanged her service for that of a very different lady  Neither the theatre nor the people about it are to my taste  I gave myself my own discharge  without condescending to the slightest explanation with Arsenia
