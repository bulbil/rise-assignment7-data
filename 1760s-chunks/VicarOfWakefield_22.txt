not knowing what to say —   What only pretty well    returned she    I think it is very well  Suppose the girls should come to make acquaintances of taste in town  And this I am assured of  that London is the only place in the world for all manner of husbands  Besides  my dear  stranger things happen every day  and as ladies of quality are so taken with my daughters  what will not men of quality be  Entre nous  I protest I like my Lady Blarney vastly  so very obliging  However  Miss Carolina Wilelmina Amelia Skeggs has my warm heart  But yet  when they came to talk of places in town  you saw at once how I nailed them  Tell me  my dear  don t you think I did for my children there    —   Ay    returned I  not knowing well what to think of the matter    heaven grant they may be both the better for it this day three months    This was one of those observations I usually made to impress my wife with an opinion of my sagacity  for if the  Page  113  girls succeeded  then it was a pious wish fulfilled  but if any thing unfortunate ensued  then it might be looked upon as a prophecy  All this conversation  however  was only preparatory to another scheme  and indeed I dreaded as much  This was nothing less than  that as we were now to hold up our heads a little higher in the world  it would be proper to sell the Colt  which was grown old  at a neighbouring fair  and buy us an horse that would carry single or double upon an occasion  and make a pretty appearance at church or upon a visit  This at first I opposed stoutly  but it was as stoutly defended  However  as I weakened  my antagonist gained strength  till at last it was resolved to  part with him     As the fair happened on the following day  I had intentions of going myself  but my wife persuaded me that I had got a cold  and nothing could prevail upon her to permit me from home    No  my dear    said she    our son Moses is a discreet boy   Page  114  and can buy and sell to very good advantage  you know all our great bargains are of his purchasing  He always stands out and higgles  and actually tires them till he gets a bargain      As I had some opinion of my son s prudence  I was willing enough to entrust him with this commission  and the next morning I perceived his sisters mighty busy in fitting out Moses for the fair  trimming his hair  brushing his buckles  and cocking his hat with pins  The business of the toilet being over  we had at last the satisfaction of seeing him mounted upon the Colt  with a deal box before him to bring home groceries in  He had on a coat made of that cloth they call thunder and lightning  which  though grown too short  was much too good to be thrown away  His waistcoat was of gosling green  and his sisters had tied his hair with a broad black ribband  We all followed him several paces from the door  bawling after him  Page  115  good luck  good luck  till we could see him no longer   He was scarce gone  when Mr  Thornhill s butler came to congratulate us upon our good fortune  saying  that he overheard his young master mention our names with great commendations   Good fortune seemed resolved not to come alone  Another footman from the same family followed  with a card for my daughters  importing  that the two ladies had received such a pleasing account from Mr  Thornhill of us all  that  after a few previous enquiries more  they hoped to be perfectly satisfied    Ay    cried my wife    I now see it is no easy matter to get into the families of the great  but when one once gets in  then  as Moses says  they may go sleep    To this piece of humour  for she intended it for wit  my daughters assented with a loud laugh of pleasure  In short  such was her satisfaction at this message  that she actually put her hand to her  Page  116  pocket  and gave the messenger seven pence halfpenny     This was to be our visiting day  The next that came was Mr  Burchell  who had been at the fair  He brought my little ones a pennyworth of gingerbread each  which my wife undertook to keep for them  and give them by letters at a time  He brought my daughters also a couple of boxes  in which they might keep wafers  snuff  patches  or even money  when they got it  My wife was usually fond of a weesel skin purse  as being the most lucky  but this by the bye  We had still a regard for Mr  Burchell  though his late rude behaviour was in some measure displeasing  nor could we now
