was treated with the utmost tenderness by my mistress and her daughter    169 who vied one with the other in their care and attendance of him  but Lavement himself could not forbear expressing his joy  by several malicious grins  while he ordered me to prepare an unguent to anoint him with —As to myself  no body can doubt my gratification  when I had every day an opportunity of seeing my revenge protracted on the body of my adversary  by the sores and ulcers I had been the cause of  and indeed I not only enjoyed the satisfaction of having flead him alive  but another also which I had not foreseen —The story of his being attacked and stript in such a place  having been inserted in the news  gave information to those who found his cloaths next day  whither to bring them  and accordingly he retrieved every thing he had lost  except a few letters  among which was that which I had wrote to him in the name of the apothecary s wife —This and the others  which  it seems  were all on the subject of love   for this Hibernian hero was one of those people who are called fortune hunters  fell into the hands of a certain female author  famous for the scandal she has published  who  after having embellished them with some ornaments of her own invention  gave them to the town in print —I was very much shocked on reflecting  that I might possibly be the occasion of a whole family s unhappiness  on account of the letter I had written  but was eased of that apprehension  when I understood that the Chelsea apothecary had commenced a law suit against the printer for defamation  and looked upon the whole as a piece of forgery  committed by the author  who had disappeared —But whatever might be his opinion of the matter  our two ladies seemed to entertain a   170 different idea of it  for  as soon as the pamphlet appeared  I could perceive their care of their patient considerably diminish  until at last it ended in total neglect —It was impossible for him to be ignorant of this change  any more than of the occasion of it  but as he was conscious to himself of having deserved worse than contempt at their hands  he was glad to come off so cheaply  and contented himself with muttering curses and threats against the apothecary  who  as he imagined  having got an inkling of the appointment with his wife  had taken revenge of him in the manner described —By that time he had got a new scarf skin  his character was become so notorious  that he thought it high time for him to decamp  which he performed one night without beat of drum  after having robbed his own servant of every thing that belonged to him except the cloaths he had on his back —A few days after he disappeared  Mr  Lavement  for his own security  took into custody a large old trunk which he had left  and as it was very heavy  made no question of the contents being sufficient to indemnify him for what Odonnel owed in lodging —But a month being elapsed without hearing any tidings of this adventurer  and my master being impatient to know what the trunk contained  he ordered me to break it open in his presence  which I performed with the pestle of our great mortar  and discovered  to his inexpressible astonishment and mortification  a heap of stones   About this time  my friend Strap informed me of an offer he had to go abroad with a gentleman in quality of valet de chambre  and at the same time assured me  that whatever advantage he   171 might propose to himself from this prospect  he could not bear the thoughts of parting from me  so much was he attached to my fortune —In spite of all the obligations I owed this poor honest fellow  ingratitude is so natural to the heart of man  that I began to be tired of his acquaintance  and now  that I had contracted other friendships which appeared more creditable  I was even ashamed to see a journey man barber enquiring after me with the familiarity of a companion —I therefore  on pretence of consulting his welfare  insisted upon his accepting the proposal  which he at last determined to embrace  with great reluctance  and in a few days took his leave of me  shedding a flood of tears  which I could not behold without emotion —I now began to look upon myself as a gentleman in reality  learned to dance of a Frenchman whom I had cured of a fashionable distemper  frequented plays during the holidays  became the oracle of an ale house  where every dispute was referred to my decision  and at length contracted an acquaintance with a young lady  who found means to make a conquest of my heart  and upon whom I prevailed  after much attendance and solicitation  to give me a promise of marriage —As this beautiful creature passed for a rich heiress  I blessed my good fortune  and was actually on the point of crowning all my wishes  by matrimony  when one morning  I went to her lodgings  and her maid being abroad  took the privilege of a bridegroom to enter her chamber  where to my utter confusion I found her in bed with a man —Heaven
