converse with him  because I knew from experience the nature of his  conversation  which was so disagreeable and tormenting  that I would  have exchanged it at any time for a good beating  and thought myself  a gainer by the bargain  However  he persisted in his importunities to  such a degree  that I assented to his proposal  on condition that the  duke of L   should be present at the interview  and he immediately sent  a message for his grace  while I  in peace  ate my breakfast  conveyed  in a basket  which was hoisted up to the window of my bedchamber    The duke was so kind as to come at my lord s request  and  before I  would open the door  gave me his word  that I should be protected from  all violence and compulsion  Thus assured  they were permitted to enter     6 22 15  3 45 PM   My little gentleman  sitting down by my bedside  began to repeat the old  hackneyed arguments he had formerly used  with a view of inducing me  to live with him  and I  on my side  repeated my former objections  or  pretended to listen to his representations  while my imagination was  employed in contriving the means of effecting an escape  as the duke  easily perceived by my countenance    Finding all his remonstrances ineffectual  he quitted the chamber  and  left his cause to the eloquence of his grace  who sat with me a whole  half hour  without exerting himself much in behalf of his client   because he knew I was altogether obstinate and determined on that score   but joked upon the behaviour of his lordship  who  though jealous of  most people  had left him alone with me in my bedchamber  observing   that he must neither have great confidence in his virtue  or a very  bad opinion of him otherwise  In short  I found means to defer the  categorical answer till next day  and invited the duke and his lordship  to dine with me to morrow  My wise yoke fellow seemed to doubt the  sincerity of this invitation  and was very much disposed to keep  possession of my house  But  by the persuasion of his grace  and the  advice of H    who was his chief counsellor and back  he was prevailed  upon to take my word  and for the present left me    They were no sooner retired  than I rose with great expedition  packed  up my clothes  and took shelter in Essex for the first time  Next day   my lord and his noble friend came to dinner  according to appointment   and being informed of my escape by my woman  whom I left in the house   his lordship discovered some signs of discontent  and insisted upon  seeing my papers  upon which my maid produced a parcel of bills which  I owed to different people  Notwithstanding this disappointment  he sat  down to what was provided for dinner  and with great deliberation ate up  a leg of lamb  the best part of a fowl  and something else  which I do  not now remember  and then very peaceably went away  giving my maid an  opportunity of following me to the place of my retreat    My intention was to have sought refuge  as formerly  in another  country  but I was prevented from putting my design in execution by a  fit of illness  during which I was visited by my physician and some of  my own relations  particularly a distant cousin of mine  whom my lord  had engaged in his interests  by promising to recompense her amply  if  she could persuade me to comply with his desire  In this office she was  assisted by the doctor  who was my friend  and a man of sense  for whom  I have the most perfect esteem  though he and I have often differed  in point of opinion  In a word  I was exposed to the incessant  importunities of all my acquaintance  which  added to the desperate  circumstances of my fortune  compelled me to embrace the terms that were  offered  and I again returned to the domestic duties of a wife    I was conducted to my lord s house by an old friend of mine  a  gentleman turned of fifty  of admirable parts and understanding  he  was a pleasing companion  cheerful and humane  and had acquired a great  share of my esteem and respect  In a word  his advice had great weight  in my deliberations  because it seemed to be the result of experience  and disinterested friendship  Without all doubt  he had an unfeigned  concern for my welfare  but  being an admirable politician  his scheme  was to make my interest coincide with his own inclinations  for I had   unwittingly  made an innovation upon his heart  and as he thought I  should hardly favour his passion while I was at liberty to converse with    6 22 15  3 45 PM   the rest of
