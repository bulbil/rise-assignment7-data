room   I am grieved at my heart for her  I never knew a more excellent young creature   She is very attentive at her devotions  and as constant in them as she used to be  Every good habit she preserves  yet  at other times  rambles much   She is often for writing Letters to you  but when what she writes is privately taken from her  she makes no enquiry about it  but takes a new sheet  and begins again   Sometimes she draws  But her subjects are generally    370 Angels and Saints  She often meditates in a map of the British dominions  and now and then wishes she were in England   Lady Juliana de Sforza is earnest to have her with her at Urbino  or at Milan  where she has also a noble palace  but I hope it will not be granted  That Lady professes to love her  but she cannot be persuaded out of her notion of harch methods which will never do with Clementina   I shall not be able to stay long with her  The discomposure of so excellent a young creature affects me deeply  Could I do her either good her pleasure  I should be willing to deny myself the society of my dear friends at Florence  But I am persuaded  and have hinted as much  that one interview with you would do more to settle her mind  than all the methods they have taken   I hope  Sir  to see you before you leave Italy  It must be at Florence  not at Bologna  I believe  It is generous of you to propose the latter   I have now been here a week  without hope  The doctors they have consulted are all for severe methods  and low diet  The first  I think  is in compliment to some of the family  She is so loth to take nourishment  and when she does  is so very abstemious  that the regimen is hardly necessary  She never  or but very seldom  used to drink any thing but water   She took it into her poor head several times this day  and perhaps it will hold  to sit in particular places  to put on attentive looks  as if she were listening to somebody  She sometimes smiled  and seemed pleased  looked up  as if to somebody  and spoke English  I have no doubt  though I was not present when she assumed these airs  and talked English  but her disordered imagination brought before her her tutor instructing her in that tongue   You desired me  Sir  to be very particular  I have been so  but at the expence of my eyes  And I shall   371 not wonder if your humane heart should be affected by my sad tale   God preserve you  and prosper you in whatsoever you undertake   HORTENSIA BEAUMONT   Mrs  Beaumont staid at Bologna twelve days  and then left the unhappy young Lady   At taking leave  she asked her  What commands she had for her —Love me  said she  and pitty me  that is one  Another is  whispering her   you will see the Chevalier  perhaps  tho  I must not —Tell him  that his poor friend Clementina is sometimes very unhappy —Tell him  that she shall rejoice to sit next him in Heaven —Tell him  that I say he cannot go thither  good man as he is  while he shuts his eyes to the truth —Tell him  that I shall take it very kindly of him  if he will not think of marrying till he acquaints me with it  and can give me assurance  that the Lady will love him as well as Somebody else would have done —O Mrs  Beaumont  should the Chevalier Grandison marry a woman unworthy of him  what a disgrace would that be to me   Mr  Grandison by this time had prepared everything for his journey to Paris  The friend he honoured with his Love  was arrived from the Levant  and the Archipelago  Thither  at his patron s request  he had accompanied Mr  Beauchamp  the amiable friend of both  and at parting  engaged to continue by Letter what had been the subject of their daily conversations  and transmit to him as many particulars as he could obtain of Mr  Grandison s sentiments and behaviour  on every occasion  Mr  Beauchamp proposing him as a pattern to himself  that he might be worthy of the Credential Letters he had furnished him with to every one whom he had thought deserving of his own acquaintance  when he was in the parts which Mr  Beauchamp intended to visit     372 To the care of the person so much honoured by his confidence  Mr  Grandison left his agreeable ward  Miss Jervois  requesting the assistance of Mrs  Beaumont  who kindly promised her inspection  and with the goodness for which she is so eminently noted  performed her promise in his absence   He then made an offer to the Bishop to visit Bologna once more  but that not being accepted  he set out for Paris   It was not long before his father s death called him to England  and when he had been there a few weeks
