unhappy woman  therefore  neither knew on what foundation the   accusation against her was built  nor what evidences could be produced   to prove it  she might very well be bewildered in her thoughts  and not   know what course to take  yet  amidst all these matters of astonishment    oppressed with grief  and struck with horror at the near prospect of   approaching infamy  she had courage  and presence enough of mind  to   enable her to do every thing that was necessary for her defence in so   bad a cause       Mr  Goodman s indisposition putting a stop to the process  she had time   to consult with those whom she found most qualified for the purpose  Her   chief agent was a pettifogger  or understrapper in the law  one who knew   all those quirks and evasions  which are called the knavish part of it    and as the extreme indigence of his circumstances made him ready to   undertake any thing  though ever so desperate  provided it afforded a   prospect of advantage  so he had impudence and cunning enough to go   through with it  even to the hazard of his ears       This man kept up her spirits  by assuring her  he would find ways and   means so to puzzle the cause  that nothing should be clearly proved   against her  but there was no opportunity for him to exercise his   abilities in this way  for Mr  Goodman s death soon after furnished him   with another  Lady Mellasin was no sooner informed  by spies she kept   continually about Mr  Goodman s house  that his life was despaired of    than they set about making his will  the first article of which  after   the prelude usual in such writings  was this             Imprimis  I give and bequeathe to my dear and well beloved wife         Margaret  Lady Mellasin Goodman  the full sum of thirty thousand        pounds of lawful money of Great Britain  over and above what        otherwise she might lay claim to as my widow  in consideration of        the great wrong I have done her  through the insinuations of        malicious and evil minded persons  which I now heartily repent me        of  and hope that God and she will forgive me for it        Then followed some other legacies to several of his kindred  and those   of his friends  whom he had been known to have been the most intimate   with  but the sums to each were very trifling  and did not amount  in   the whole  to above seven or eight hundred pounds  As everyone who had   the least acquaintance with Mr  Goodman  was very well convinced that he   had always intended his nephew for his heir  the pretended will went on   in this manner             Item  I give and bequeathe to my dear nephew  Edward Goodman  the        son of Nathanial Goodman  and of Catherine his wife  late of Bengal        in the East Indies  the whole residue of my effects  whatsoever and        wheresoever they shall be found at my demise  provided that he  the        said Edward Goodman  shall take to be his lawful wife  Flora        Mellasin  only daughter and remaining issue of Sir Thomas Mellasin         and of the above mentioned Margaret his wife  but in case that        either party shall refuse to enter into such marriage  then that        he  the said Edward Goodman  shall be obliged to pay to the said        Flora Mellasin the full sum of five thousand pounds of lawful money        of Great Britain  in consideration of the misfortunes she has        suffered by the injury I have done her mother        This impudent piece of forgery was signed Samuel Goodman  in a character   so like that gentleman s  that  when compared with other papers of his   own hand writing  the difference could not be distinguished by those who   were best acquainted with it  two persons also  of the lawyer s   procuring  set their names as witnesses       Notwithstanding the flagrancy of this attempt  Lady Mellasin flattered   herself with the hopes of it s success  and  on Mr  Goodman s death    threw in a caveat against the real will  and set up this pretended one
