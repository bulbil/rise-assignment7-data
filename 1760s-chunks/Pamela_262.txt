that I may   not impute to myself  and be proud  my inexpressible happiness       The company were so kindly pleased with our concern  and my dear   master s goodness  that he  observing their indulgence  and being   himself curious to know the further particulars of what had passed   between my lady and me  repeated his question  What she had called me   besides wench and creature  And I said  My lady  supposing I was wicked    lamented over me  very kindly  my depravity and fall  and said  What a   thousand pities it was  so much virtue  as she was pleased to say  was   so destroyed  and that I had yielded  after so noble a stand  as she   said       Excuse me  gentlemen and ladies  said I  you know my story  it seems    and I am commanded  by one who has a title to all my obedience  to   proceed       They gave all of them bows of approbation  that they might not interrupt   me  and I continued my story  the men servants withdrawing  at a motion   of Mr  B      on my looking towards them  and then  at Lady Darnford s   coming in  I proceeded       I told her ladyship  that I was still innocent  and would be so  and   it was injurious to suppose me otherwise  Why  tell me  wench  said   she  But I think I must not tell you what she said  Yes  do  said my   master  to clear my sister  we shall think it very bad else       I held my hand before my face  Why  she said  Tell me  wench  hast thou   not been  hesitating  a very free creature with thy master  That she   said  or to that effect  And when I said  She asked strange questions    and in strange words  she ridiculed my delicacy  as she called it  and   said  My niceness would not last long  She said  I must know I was not   really married  that my ring was only a sham  and all was my cunning to   cloak my yielding  and get better terms  She said  She knew the world as   much at thirty two  as I did at sixteen  and bid me remember that       I took the liberty to say   but I got a good way off   that I scorned   her ladyship s words  and was as much married as her ladyship  And then   I had certainly been cuffed  if her woman had not interposed  and told   her I was not worthy her anger  and that I was as much to be pitied for   my credulity  as despised for my vanity       My poor Pamela  said my master  this was too  too hard upon you  O sir    said I  how much easier it was to me than if it had been so   That would   have broken my heart quite   For then I should have deserved it all  and   worse  and these reproaches  added to my own guilt  would have made me   truly wretched       Lady Darnford  at whose right hand I sat  kissed me with a kind of   rapture  and called me a sweet exemplar for all my sex  Mr  Peters said   very handsome things  so did Mr  Perry and Sir Simon  with tears in his   eyes  said to my master  Why  neighbour  neighbour  this is excellent    by my troth  I believe there is something in virtue  that we had not   well considered  On my soul  there has been but one angel come down for   these thousand years  and you have got her       Well  my dearest  said my master  pray proceed with your story until  we   have done supper  since the ladies seem pleased with it  Why  sir  said   I  her ladyship went on in the same manner  but said  one time   and   held me by the hand   she would give me an hundred guineas for one   provoking word  or  if I would but say I believed myself married  that   she might fell me at her foot  But  sir  you must not be angry with her   ladyship  She called me painted dirt  baby face  waiting maid  beggar s   brat  and beggar born  but I said  As long as I knew my innocence  I was   easy in every thing  but to have my dear parents abused  They were never   beggars  nor beholden
