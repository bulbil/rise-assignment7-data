interdicts against the superannuated archbishop  The devil a bit  he did neither the one thing nor the other  But his countenance fell  and his whole air was that of an absent man  the rest of his dinner was bolted down without the garnish of intermediate talk about Maecenas  as soon as he had done  he hurried from table without minding grace or gratitude  wished me good day with a cold and distant air  and got off as fast as possible  The unfeeling scoundrel  perceiving that I was no longer in a situation for him to pump anything out of me  would not even take the trouble to draw a decent veil over his dirty principles  But such a blackguard could excite no other sensation than contempt and laughter  Looking at him with derision  the fittest chastisement for fellows like these  I called after him loud enough to be heard by the whole room  Stop there  you nun s priest  Go and put those two bottles in ice against Maecenas comes to the Sabine farm  Be sure they are rich  genuine  and old  or they will be a farce to Falernian       CH  VI     Gil Blas goes to the play at Grenada  His surprise at seeing one of the actresses  and what happened thereupon   No sooner had Garcias rid the room of his presence  than two gentlemen came in  extremely well dressed  and took their seats close by me  They began talking about the players of the Grenada company  and about a new piece which just then had a great run  According to their account  it was quite the town talk  Nothing would do for me  but to go and see it that very day  I had never been at the play since my residence at Grenada  As I had lived nearly the whole time in the archbishop s palace  where all such profane shews were condemned as uncanonical  I had been cut off from every recreation of that sort  All my knowledge of men and manners was drawn from homilies   I repaired therefore to the theatre at the appointed hour  and found a very full house  All around me  discussions were going on about the piece before the curtain drew up  and there was not a soul in the numerous assembly but had some remark to make upon it  One liked it  another could not bear it  Do not you think the dialogue is particularly happy  said a candid critic on my right  Was there ever such miserable stuff  cried a snarling critic on my left  In good truth  if bad authors abound  it must be admitted that the public are at variance about what is good and what is bad  but the bad judges have a right to be pleased for their money  and as they far outnumber the good ones  their favourite writers can never want employment  When one only considers through what an ordeal dramatic poets have to pass  it is a matter of wonder that any should be found hardy enough at once to contend against the ignorance of the multitude  and the random shot of those self created guides in matters of taste  who always pretend to lead the blindness of the public judgment  and too frequently push it into the mire of absurdity   At length the buffoon of the piece came forward by way of prologue  As soon as his grotesque countenance was visible  there was a general clapping of hands  a sure indication of his being one of those spoiled actors  who are allowed to take any liberties with the pit  and to be applauded through thick and thin  in fact  this player neither opened his lips  nor moved a muscle  without exciting the most extravagant raptures  He would have performed better  had he been less conscious what a favourite he was  But he presumed on that circumstance most abominably  I observed that he sometimes forgot what was set down for him  and took the licence of adding to his part out of his own free fancy  a common cause of complaint against low comedians  which  though it make the unskilful laugh  cannot but make the judicious grieve  Would the audience but receive such mirth with hisses  instead of crying bravo  they might restrain the absurd practice  and purge the stage from barbarism   Some of the other performers were greeted with the usual tokens on their entrance  and particularly an actress who played the chambermaid  There was something about her which more than usually attracted my attention  and language must sink under the labour of expressing my astonishment at tracing the features of Laura  that fair  that chaste  that inexpressible she  whom I supposed to be still at Madrid  warbling in one key  with hands  sides  voice  and mind incorporate with Arsenia  But there could be no doubt of her identity  The kick in her gallop  the leer in her eye  and the tripping pertness of her tongue  all conspired in evidence that there could be no mistake  Yet  as if I had refused belief to the affidavit of my own eyes and ears  I asked her name of a gentleman who was sitting beside me  What the deuce  Why  where do you come from  said he  You
