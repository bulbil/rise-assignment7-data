had a mind     ALL   Oh  no  to be sure  no  to be sure     First GOSSIP   Now  ladies  give me leave to ask you  whether  as Adam never was born  as other people have been sence  that is  no lady was ever brought to bed  or with child of him  could he have a navel     ALL   No  no  no  to be sure  no     Third GOSSIP   My brother  ladies  we all know is a great writer  and once wrote a whole news paper himself  He is so great a genus at handling his pen  that I was tould by the waiter at Ronelor  how he mought have wrote a song  and it would have been sung before the grand company there  and that you know  madam  wou d be the vastest honour imaginable  because the quality cou d recommend him  you know  to be poet larum song maker to the rial familly  but he has gone and disobliged my husband  and all his friends  for he has hired himself to a club of philosophers  and so be is to publish a book  to prove  how far free will acts upon the load stone  and he says  he don t doubt but he ll get a penshum for t     Page  132  Mrs  Murdock  the nurse  then began a discourse upon ethics  to determine the identical spot of Satan s demesnes  or where hell fire was  She affirmed it to be seated in the middle of the sun—but Madam Celery  the green grocer s lady  denied that  and said it was in the middle of the earth     Miss Shred  who was always a systemist  supposed there were several hells  and that every comet contained one  — The Bible was quoted by Jenny Douglass  but when it was asked what Bible  because Mrs  Murdock observed  there were so many histories of the Bible  published at six pence per month  she cou dn t tell what to say to it  for she didn t suppose they could be all good  because the blue paper covers said so     Madam Llwhyddwhuydd observed  that she supposed they were all true translations  and explications  or else  to be sure  the bishops would not suffer such things to be published     Mrs  MURDOCK   Well  there are so many religions  and so many religious opinions  and so many books about religion  and so many disputes  and so many sort of preachers  that they are not all to be trusted     First GOSSIP   No  Madam  why an t they all christians     Mrs  MURDOCK   Christians  no  Madam — why some are Presbyterians  and some are Methodists     Page  133  Miss SHRED   As to Methodists  Madam Murdock  you must excuse me  because they are the only christians  for they are regenerated  and no body can be a sincere christian  until being regenerated  but there are a great many people in the world that are of no religion     Mrs  MURDOCK   And that s better  than not being of the true one for its a shame to see how parents use their children  here the poor innocents are soused over head and ears  or else they are circumscised  or else made Quakers  or else one thing done to them  or else another  and so they are bound prentice to this  or to that teligion  without ever knowing if they can like it  — And that makes so many different opinions in the world  when they grow up to be men and women  because it don t signify whether they were made Jews or Christians  you see Jews behave as Christians  and Christians as Jews  and there s no telling one from to ther  I think     This conversation determined Madam Llwhyddwhuydd  that as there were such disputes about religion  her son should not undergo any spiritual ceremony  until he came to years of discretion  then he might chuse which religion he liked best  and that was the reason  our Master Neddy was never christened     Page  134  SCENE  ISLINGTON   Thus far the Editor compiled of the MSS  and attended on the appointed Sunday at Mr  WARNER S  who is a very good sort of a man  and one to whom the putter together of these historical paragraphs has been very much obliged     This would not have been mentioned  but to convince the world all authors are not so ingrateful  as to forget the friends  who formerly filled their bellies     I have composed Drolls for Mr  Warner s booth  and by his recommendation  I have wrote several dramas for the proprietors of puppet shows  in which  I used to adhere entirely to the strict rules of Aristotle  Rapin  and Bossu  The chastity of taste among English audiences at that time was so pure  they would not bear the smallest
