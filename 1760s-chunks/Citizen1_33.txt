was obliged to preserve the appearance of ill nature before me  and yet relieve himself by relieving the sailor  Casting therefore a furious look upon some bundles of chips which the fellow carried in a string at his back  my friend demanded how he sold his matches  but not waiting for a reply  desired  in a surly tone  to have a shilling s worth  The sailor seemed at first surprised at his demand  but soon recollecting himself  and presenting his whole bundle  Here  master  says he  take all my cargo  and a blessing into the bargain   It is impossible to describe with what an air of triumph my friend marched off with his new purchase  he assured me that he was firmly of opinion that those fellows must have stolen their goods  who could thus afford to sell them for half value  he informed me of several different uses to which those chips might be applied  he expatiated largely upon the savings that would result from lighting candles with a match instead of thrusting them into the fire  He averred  that he would as soon have parted with a tooth as his money to those vagabonds  unless for some valuable consideration  I cannot tell how long this panegyric upon frugality and matches might have continued  had not his attention been called off by another object more distressful than either of the former  A woman in rags  with one child in her arms  and another on her back  was attempting to sing ballads  but with such a mournful voice that it was difficult to determine whether she was singing or crying  A wretch  who  in the deepest distress still aimed at good humour  was an object my friend was by no means capable of withstanding  his vivacity  and his discourse were instantly   103 interrupted  upon this occasion his very dissimulation had forsaken him  Even  in my presence  he immediately applied his hands to his pockets  in order to relieve her  but guess his confusion  when he found he had already given away all the money he carried about him to former objects  The misery painted in the woman s visage  was not half so strongly expressed as the agony in his  He continued to search for some time  but to no purpose  till  at length  recollecting himself  with a face of ineffable good nature  as he had no money  he put into her hands his shilling s worth of matches   LETTER XXVI  To the same   AS there appeared something reluctantly good in the character of my companion  I must own it surprized me what could be his motives for thus concealing virtues which others take such pains to display  I was unable to repress my desire of knowing the history of a man who thus seemed to act under continual restraint  and whose benevolence was rather the effect of appetite than reason   It was not however till after repeated solicitations he thought proper to gratify my curiosity    If you are fond  says he  of hearing hair breadth  scapes  my history must certainly please  for I have been for twenty years upon the very verge of starving  without ever being starved     104My father  the younger son of a good family  was possessed of a small living in the church  His education was above his fortune  and his generosity greater than his education  Poor as he was  he had his flatterers still poorer than himself  for every dinner he gave them  they returned him an equivalent in praise  and this was all he wanted  the same ambition that actuates a monarch at the head of an army  influenced my father at the head of his table  he told the story of the ivy tree  and that was laughed at  he repeated the jest of the two scholars and one pair of breeches  and the company laughed at that  but the story of Taffy in the sedan chair was sure to set the table in a roar  thus his pleasure encreased in proportion to the pleasure he gave  he loved all the world  and he fancied all the world loved him   As his fortune was but small  he lived up to the very extent of it  he had no intentions of leaving his children money  for that was dross  he was resolved they should have learning  for learning  he used to observe  was better than silver or gold  For this purpose he undertook to instruct us himself  and took as much pains to form our morals  as to improve our understanding  We were told that universal benevolence was what first cemented society  we were taught to consider all the wants of mankind as our own  to regard the human face divine with affection and esteem  he wound us up to be mere machines of pity  and rendered us incapable of withstanding the slightest impulse made either by real or fictitious distress  in a word  we were perfectly instructed in the art of giving   105 away thousands  before we were taught the more necessary qualifications of getting a farthing   I cannot avoid imagining  that  thus refined by his lessons out of all my suspicion  and divested of even all the little cunning which nature had given me  I resembled  upon my
