my father s spirits in relation to this choice —To say nothing of the natural workings of humanity and justice —or of the yearnings of parental and connubial love  all which prompted him to leave as little to hazard as possible in a case of this kind —he felt himself concern d in a particular manner  that all should go right in the present case —from the  Page  102  accumulated sorrow he lay open to  should any evil betide his wife and child in lying in at Shandy Hall —He knew the world judged by events  and would add to his afflictions in such a misfortune  by loading him with the whole blame of it — Alas o day —had Mrs  Shandy  poor gentlewoman  had but her wish in going up to town just to lye in and come down again —which  they say  she begg d and pray d for upon her bare knees —and which  in my opinion  considering the fortune which Mr  Shandy got with her —was no such mighty matter to have complied with  the lady and her babe might both of  em have been alive at this hour    This exclamation  my father knew was unanswerable —and yet  it was not merely to shelter himself —nor was  Page  103  it altogether for the care of his offspring and wife that he seem d so extremely anxious about this point —my father had extensive views of things —and stood  moreover  as he thought  deeply concern d in it for the publick good  from the dread he entertained of the bad uses an ill fated instance might be put to   He was very sensible that all political writers upon the subject had unanimously agreed and lamented  from the beginning of Queen Elizabeth s reign down to his own time  that the current of men and money towards the metropolis  upon one frivolous errand or another —set in so strong —as to become dangerous to our civil rights —tho   by the bye —a current was not the image he took most delight in —a distemper was  Page  104  here his favourite metaphor  and he would run it down into a perfect allegory  by maintaining it was identically the same in the body national as in the body natural  where blood and spirits were driven up into the head faster than they could find their ways down —a stoppage of circulation must ensue  which was death in both cases   There was little danger  he would say  of losing our liberties by French politicks or French invasions —nor was he so much in pain of a consumption from the mass of corrupted matter and ulcerated humours in our constitution —which he hoped was not so bad as it was imagined —but he verily feared  that in some violent push  we should go off  all at once  in a state apoplexy —and  Page  105  then he would say  The Lord have mercy upon us all   My father was never able to give the history of this distemper —without the remedy along with it    Was I an absolute prince  he would say  pulling up his breeches with both his hands  as he rose from his arm chair   I would appoint able judges  at every avenue of my metropolis  who should take cognizance of every fool s business who came there —and if  upon a fair and candid hearing  it appeared not of weight sufficient to leave his own home  and come up  bag and baggage  with his wife and children  farmers sons   c   c  at his backside  they should be all sent back  from constable to constable  like vagrants  Page  106  as they were  to the place of their legal settlements  By this means I shall take care  that my metropolis totter d not thro  its own weight —that the head be no longer too big for the body —that the extreams  now wasted and pin d in  be restored to their due share of nourishment  and regain  with it  their natural strength and beauty —I would effectually provide  That the meadows and corn fields  of my dominions  should laugh and sing —that good chear and hospitality flourish once more —and that such weight and influence be put thereby into the hands of the Squirality of my kingdom  as should counterpoise what I perceive my Nobility are now taking from them   Page  107   Why are there so few palaces and gentlemen s seats  he would ask  with some emotion  as he walked a cross the room   throughout so many delicious provinces in France  Whence is it that the few remaining Chateaus amongst them are so dismantled —so unfurnished  and in so ruinous and desolate a condition  —Because  Sir   he would say   in that kingdom no man has any country interest to support —the little interest of any kind  which any man has any where in it  is concentrated in the court  and the looks of the Grand Monarch  by the sun shine of whose countenance  or the clouds which pass a cross it  every French man lives or dies    Another political reason which prompted my father so strongly to guard against  Page  108  the least evil accident in my mother s lying in in the country —was  That any such instance
