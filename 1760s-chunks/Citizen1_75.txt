 where we talked of nothing else  I fancy you forget  sir  cried I  you told us but this moment of your dining yesterday in town  Did I say so  replied he  cooly  to be sure if I said so  it was so—Dined in town  egad now I do remember  I did dine in town  but I dined in the country too  for you must know  my boys  I eat two dinners  By the bye  I am grown as nice as the Devil in my eating  I ll tell you a pleasant affair about that  we were a select party of us to dine at Lady Grogram s  an affected piece  but let it go no farther  a secret  well  there happened to be no Assa foetida in the sauce to a turkey  upon which  says I  I ll hold a thousand guineas  and say done first  that—But dear Dry bone  you are an honest creature  lend me half a crown for a minute or two  or so  just till—But hearkee  ask me for it the next time we meet  or it may be twenty to one but I forget to pay you   When he left us  our conversation naturally turned upon so extraordinary a character  His very dress cries my friend  is not less extraordinary than his conduct  If you meet him this day you find him in rags  if the next in embroidery  With those persons of distinction  of whom he talks so familiarly  he has scarce a coffee house acquaintance  However  both for interests of society  and perhaps for his own  heaven has made him poor  and while all the world perceive his wants  he fancies   237 them concealed from every eye  An agreeable companion because he understands flattery  and all must be pleased with the first part of his conversation  though all are sure of its ending with a demand on their purse  While his youth countenances the levity of his conduct  he may thus earn a precarious subsistance  but when age comes on  the gravity of which is incompatible with buffoonery  then will he find himself forsaken by all  Condemned in the decline of life to hang upon some rich family whom he once despised  there to undergo all the ingenuity of studied contempt  to be employed only as a spy upon the servants  or a bug bear to fright the children into obedience  Adieu   LETTER LIII  To the same   I AM apt to fancy I have contracted a new acquaintance whom it will be no easy matter to shake off  My little beau yesterday overtook me again in one of the publick walks  and slapping me on the shoulder  saluted me with an air of the most perfect familiarity  His dress was the same as usual  except that he had more powder in his hair  wore a dirtier shirt  a pair of temple spectacles  and his hat under his arm   As I knew him to be an harmless amusing little thing  I could not return his smiles with any degree of severity  so we walked forward on terms of the utmost intimacy  and in a few minutes discussed   238 all the usual topics preliminary to particular conversation   The oddities that marked his character  however  soon began to appear  he bowed to several well dressed persons  who  by their manner of returning the compliment  appeared perfect strangers  At intervals he drew out a pocket book  seeming to take memorandums before all the company  with much importance and assiduity  In this manner he led me through the length of the whole walk  fretting at his absurdities  and fancying myself laughed at not less than him by every spectator   When we were got to the end of our procession  Blast me  cries he  with an air of vivacity  I never saw the park so thin in my life before  there s no company at all to day  Not a single face to be seen  No company  interrupted I peevishly  no compapany where there is such a crowd  why man  there s too much  What are the thousand that have been laughing at us but company  Lord  my dear  returned he  with the utmost good humour  you seem immensely chagrined  but  blast me  when the world laughs at me  I laugh at the world  and so we are even  My Lord Trip  Bill Squash  the Creolian  and I sometimes make a party at being ridiculous  and so we say and do a thousand things for the joke sake  But I see you are grave  and if you are for a fine grave sentimental companion  you shall dine with me and my wise to day  I must insist on t  I ll introduce you to Mrs  Tibbs  a Lady of as elegant qualifications as any in nature  she was bred  but that s between ourselves  under the inspection of the Countess of All night  A charming body of voice  but no more   239 of that  she shall give us a song  You shall see my little gi•l t•o  Carolina Wilhelma Amelia Tibbs  a sweet pretty creature  I design her for my Lord Drumstick s
