brought them about me to know what the deuce was the matter  I informed them that I had a swinging fit of the gripes  and to humour the idea  gnashed my teeth  made all manner of wry faces till I looked like a bedlamite  and twisted my limbs as if I had been going to be delivered of a heathen oracle  Then I became calm all at once  as if my pains had abated  The next minute I flounced up and down upon my bed  and threw my arms about at random  In a word  I played my part so well that these more experienced performers  knowing as they were  suffered themselves to be thrown off their guard  and to believe that my malady was real  All at once did they busy themselves for my relief  One brought me a bottle of brandy  and forced me to gulp down half of it  another  in spite of my remonstrances  applied oil of sweet almonds in a very offensive manner  a third went and made a napkin burning hot  to be clapped upon my stomach  In vain did I cry mercy  they attributed my noise to the violence of my disorder  and went on inflicting positive evil by way of remedy for that which was artificial  At last  able to bear it no longer  I was obliged to swear that I was better  and entreat them to give me quarter  They left off killing me with kindness  and I took care not to complain any more  for fear of experiencing their tender attentions a second time   This scene lasted nearly three hours  After which the robbers  calculating it to be near day break  prepared for their journey to Mansilla  I was for getting up  as if I had set my heart on being of the party  but that they would not allow  No  no  Gil Blas  said Signor Rolando  stay here  my lad  your colic may return  You shall go with us another time  to day you are not in travelling condition  I did not think it prudent to urge my attendance too much  for fear of being taken at my word  but only affected great disappointment with so natural an air  that they all went off without the slightest misgiving of my design  After their departure  for which I had prayed most fervently  I said to myself  Now is your time  Gil Blas  to be firm and resolved  Arm yourself with courage to go through with an enterprise so propitiously begun  Domingo is tied by the leg  and Leonarda may show her teeth  but she cannot bite  Pounce down upon opportunity while it offers  you may wait long enough for another  Thus did I spirit myself up in soliloquy  Having got out of bed  I laid hold of my sword and pistols  and away I went to the kitchen  But before I made my appearance I stopped to hear what Leonarda was talking about to the fair incognita  who was come to her senses  and  on a view of her misfortune in its extremity  took on most desperately  That is right  my girl  said the old hag  cry your eyes out  sob away plentifully  you know the good effect of woman s tears  The sudden shock was too much for you  but the danger is over now the engines can play  Your grief will abate by little and little  and you wilt get reconciled to living with our gentlemen  who are very good sort of people  You will be better off than a princess  You do not know how fond they will be of you  Not a day will pass without your being obliged to some of them  Many a woman would give one of her eyes to be in your place   I did not allow Leonarda time to go on any longer with this babbling  In I went  and putting a pistol to her breast  insisted with a menacing air on her delivering up the key of the grate  She did not know what to make of my behaviour  and  though almost in the last stage of life  had such a propensity to linger on the road as not to venture on a refusal  With the key in my hand I directed the following speech to the distressed object of my compassion  Madam  Heaven sends you a deliverer in me  follow  and I will see you safe whithersoever you wish to be conducted  The lady was not deaf to my proposal  which made such an impression on her grateful heart that she jumped up with all the strength she had left  threw herself at my feet  and conjured me to save her honour  I raised her from the ground  and assured her she might rely on me  I then took some ropes which were opportunely in the kitchen  and with her assistance tied Leonarda to the legs of a large table  protesting that I would kill her if she only breathed a murmur  After that  lighting a candle  I went with the incognita to the treasury  where I filled my pockets with pistoles  single and double  as full as they could hold  To encourage the lady not to be scrupulous  I begged she would think herself at home  and
