Some instantly were slain with a thousand wounds  Catesby  Piercy  and Winter  standing back to back  fought long and desperately  till  in the end  the two first fell covered with blood  and the other was taken alive  Such as survived the slaughter were tried and convicted  several fell just victims to justice  and others experienced the King s mercy  Two Jesuits  Garnet and Oldcorn  who were privy to the plot  suffered with the rest  the King maintained  that they were punished justly  but  by their own party  they were regarded as martyrs to religion  tho  without ground  for James was too humane to condemn any upon such slight motives  as those of opinion   The discovery and extinction of this conspiracy  which was entirely owing to the wisdom of the King  gained him the love of his subjects  though it had but little influence over his parliament  in   306 extoring supplies  His desire of peace with foreign states diminished his authority at home  for  though he talked boldly of his prerogative in parliament  yet  unlike some of his predecessors  he had no standing army to back his pretensions  his speeches  which were rather arguments in favour of royal authority than directions or advice  only put both houses upon arguing with him in his own way  but not upon complying with his requests  and they refused him supplies  when they knew it could be done with impunity  His liberality and his indigence often forced him to condescensions  which  when once granted  could never be again recalled  thus  while he thought himself enlarging the royal prerogative  he was  in reality  abridging it on every side   Perhaps the opposition this King met with from his parliament  was the motive of his encouraging favourites  who might help him to reduce them to his measures  his first choice was fixed upon Robert Carr  who  from a private gentleman  was brought up  through all the gradations of preferment  till created Earl of Somerset  An amour between this gentleman and the Countess of Essex  one of the lewdest  yet finest  women of her time  at last terminated in his disgrace  his friend  Sir Thomas Overbury  had declared against his marrving this lady  who was espoused to another  this advice procured the resentment of Somerset  and the hatred of the Countess  The King  by false pretences  was instigated to confine Sir Thomas in the Tower  and here the Earl and the Countess caused him to be poisoned  When this transaction came to the King s knowledge  he delivered him to public justice  by which he was   307 condemned  but he received the royal pardon  tho  he ever after continued in disgrace   His next  and greatest favourite  was George Villars  afterwards Duke of Buckingham  whose person and beauty first drew the King s attention and regard  This nobleman was the first who was ever created a Duke in England  without being allied to the royal family  it may be reckoned among the most capricious circumstances of this reign  that a King  who was bred a scholar  should chuse  for his favourites  the most illiterate of his courtiers  that he  who trembled at a drawn sword  should lavish favours on one who promised to be the hero of a romance  Buckingham first inspired young Prince Charles  who was afterwards famous for his misfortunes and death  with a desire of going disguised into Spain  to court the Infanta  their adventures in this romantic expedition could fill novels  and have actually been made the subject of many  Charles was the knight errant  and Buckingham served under him as  squire  they set out post  and travelled through France under the names of Jack and Tom Smith  they appeared at Paris in large bushy perriwigs  which shadowed their faces  They were received in Spain with all possible respect  but Buckingham filled the whole court with intrigues  adventures  serenades  and jealousy  To make the folly complete  he fell in love with the Duchess of Olivarez  the prime minister s wife  and insulted the prime minister  These levities were not to be endured at such a court as that of Spain  where jealousy is so prevalent  and decorum so necessary  the match was broke off  and the Prince was permitted to return in safety     308 A match for this Prince was soon after negotiated with Henrietta  the daughter of Henry IV  of France  and this met with better success than the former  Charles had seen this Princess  when he passed through that kingdom in disguise  he admired her beauty  and from every quarter was informed of her senfe and discretion  A dispensation was got from the Pope for her marrying a Protestant Prince  but King James died before the consummation of the nuptials   Were we to take the character of this Monarch as described by Rapin  we should consider him as one of the worst of Princes  even while he pretends to defend him  It is this injudicious historian s method  wherever he finds a good character among our Kings  to load it with reproach  wherever he meets a bad one  to extenuate its guilt  so
