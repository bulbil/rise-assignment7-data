bid the chairmen stop when they had got out of the croud  till Lady Betty s chair  and mine  and my wife s  joined them   I saw her chair move  and Wilson with his lighted slambeaux before it  and the four masques who follow d her to the chair return into the house     162 When our servants could not find that her chair had stopt  we supposed that in the hurry  the fellow heard not my orders  and directed our chairmen to proceed  not doubting but we should find her got home before us   We had before agreed to be carried directly home  declining Lady Betty s invitation to resume our own dresses at her house  where we dressed for the Ball   We were very much surprised at finding her not arrived  But concluding that  by mistake  she was carried to Lady Betty s  and was there expecting us  we sent thither immediately   But  good God  what was our consternation  when the servants brought us word back  that Lady Betty had not either seen or heard of her   Mr  Greville  as I apprehend—  But let me give you all the lights on which I ground my surmises   Last night Lady Betty Williams had an hint given her  as she informed me at the Masquerade  that Mr  Greville  who took leave of my cousin on Tuesday evening in order to set out for Northamptonshire the next morning  was neither gone  nor intended to go  being  on the contrary  resolved to continue in town perdue  in order to watch my cousin s visitors   He had indeed told her  that she would have half a dozen spies upon her  and threw out some hints of jealousy of two of her visitors   Sir Hargrave Pollexfen in an Harlequin dress was at the Ball  He soon discover d our lovely cousin  and  notwithstanding his former ill nature on being rejected by her  addressed her with the politeness of a man accustomed to public places   He found me out at the side board a little before we went off  and ask d me  if I had not seen Mr  Greville there  I said  No   He ask d me  If I had not observed a mask distinguished by a broad brim d half slouched hat  with a   163 high flat crown  a short black cloak  a dark lantern in his hand  holding it up to every one s masque  and who  he said  was saluted by every body as Guido Vaux  That person he said was Mr  Greville   I did indeed observe this person  but recollected not  that he had the air of Mr  Greville  but thought him a much more bulky man  But that  as he intended to have it supposed he had left the town  might be easily managed   Mr  Greville  you know  is a man of enterprize   He came to town  having professedly no other material business but to give obstruction to my cousin s visitors  He saw she had two new ones  He talk d at first of staying in town  and partaking of its diversions  and even of bespeaking a new equi   But all of a sudden  tho  expecting Mr  Fenwick would come up  he pretended to leave the town  and to set out directly for Northamptonshire  without having obtained any concession from my cousin in his favour   Laying all these circumstances together  I think it is hardly to be doubted  but Mr  Greville is at the bottom of this black affair   You will therefore take such steps on these lights as your prudence will suggest to you  If Mr  Greville is not come down—If Mr  Fenwick—What would I say   The less noise  however  the affair makes  till we can come at certainty  the better   How I dread what that certainty may be —Dear creature   But I am sure you will think it adviseable to keep this dreadful affair from her poor grandmother  And I hope your good lady—Yet her prudent advice may be necessary   I have six people out at different parts of the town  who are to make enquiries among chairmen  coachmen   c     164 Her new servant cannot be a villain—What can one say —What can one think   We have sent to his sister  who keeps an inn in Smithfield  She has heard nothing of him   I have sent after the chairmen who carried her to this cursed Masquerade  Lady Betty s chairmen  who had provided the chairs  know them  and their number  They are traced with a fare from White s to Berkeley square   Something may be discovered by means of those fellows  if they were tamper d with  They are afraid  I suppose  to come to demand their but half earned money  Woe be to them if they come out to be rascals   I had half a suspicion of Sir Hargrave  as well from the character given us of him by a friend of mine  as because of his unpolite behaviour to the dear creature on her rejecting him  And sent to his house in Cavendish square
