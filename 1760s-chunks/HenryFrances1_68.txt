all the liquid Fields of Air  to contemplate the Glories of its own Essence  in the immediate Presence of that Almighty Being  from whom it sprung  Perhaps it longs to be again restored to the dear Converse of some much loved and long lamented Friend  On the Contrary  a Person in this World  who is separated from those  he has loved long  and well  bears the worst Kind of Death  a living one  and may be considered in the same State  as I should suppose an angelick Being  if banished from his Creator s Presence  compelled to take a human Form  and live on Earth  among the Sons of Men  It is retaining a strong Idea of the Happiness  he had once enjoyed  must double every Distress  and his Desire to be restored to the Converse  he was deprived of  must render all other painful to him   Let me now ask you  if you suppose  that any rational Being would voluntarily rush into such a Scene of Misery  as I have described  Yet this must be the End of all that Love  that Constancy and Truth  I have preserved inviolable   236 to you—painful Reflection  this last Paragraph has sunk my Spirits so very low  that I must quit the Subject —Oh  that my Heart could shut it out for ever   I think it is Cowley says    a Man must intirely be divested of all Affections  as well as Passion  before he can enjoy the Pleasures of Solitude  For  if his Mind be possessed with either  he had better been in a Fair  than a Wood  for our Passions may  like petty Thieves  pick our Pockets in the Midst of Company  but  like Robbers  they use to strip  bind  or murder us  when they catch us alone  This is but to retreat from Men  and fall into the Hands of the Devil   I therefore congratulate you  and should endeavour to condole myself  did not your Happiness always appear of more Moment to me  than my own  but as I have not so entirely subdued my Passions  as you seem to have done  I can only pretend to assure you  from the Sincerity of my Heart  that I would prefer your Company to that of any Person  who does  or ever did exist  I do not except any one of the first  or last Augustan Age —And I may go farther  by assuring you  that  if I know my own Heart  I would prefer you to all of them  and live in Shades  with thee  and Love alone  or  to use the Words of the Author I have already quoted —    237With thee  for ever  I in Woods could rest   c —    Your remembering any Sentiment of mine  affords the highest Triumph both to my Love  and Vanity  For you  and you only  can raise either  I don t wonder at all  that you should prefer Communing with your own Heart  to any other Conversation  this World can afford  it surely must be a Kind of Anticipation of those celestial Joys  we are to suppose the Portion of the Blessed  as it must continually fill your Mind with the highest Sentiments of Gratitude and Rapture to the Divine Being  who has been graciously pleased to bring you so much nearer his infinite Perfection  than your Fellow creatures  He has  indeed  my dearest Harry  blessed you with such uncommon Talents  as render it impossible for you to be negatively good  and must either make you an Ornament  or Disgrace to that Rank of Beings  you are placed in   I thank you heartily for your very elegant Compliment  but I am well convinced  both from Reason and Experience  that you must have less Understanding  or I more  before you can possibly prefer my Company to your own   I received your Essay  and am excessively angry that you have left me nothing to say on the Occasion  it is so like Conviction  which I hate  because it destroys Argument  How was it possible for you to find Words to demonstrate the undoubted Truths  which you have proved    238 For I look upon this to be the most difficult Species of Writing   Now for myself  which  by just Gradation  I mention last  I have been very ill with constant Cholicks  ever since you left Town  I grow worse every Day  and am at last  prevailed on to take an Emetick  which disagreeable Operation I shall set about  the Moment I have finished this abominable Scrawl  I absolutely don t know what I write  My Aunt has been talking to me ever since I took up the Pen  I am really ashamed to let such a Collection of Blots  Blunders  and Tautologies go out of my Hands  but  if I ever had any Talent for Writing  it is intirely worn out  and I set about it with as much Reluctance  as I do Eating  when I have no Appetite  merely because I know it is necessary to my supporting Life   You are not  sent a banished Man  to roam
