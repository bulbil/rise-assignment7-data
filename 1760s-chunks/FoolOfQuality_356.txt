  the sweet compunctions and emotions of the human heart  by Jesus   forming it to divine      The truth is  that people live incomparably more by impulse and   inclination than by reason and precept  Keason and precept are   not always within our beck   to have their due influence  they   require frequent inculcation and frequent recollection   but impulse   and inclination are more than at hand  they are within us  and   from the citadel rule the outworks of man at pleasure      When the apostle  speaking of Christ  affirms that   there is no   other name under heaven whereby a man may be saved   and   again  when he affirms that    those who had not received the law    are a law unto themselves     he intends one and the same thing    He intends that Christ  from the fall of man  is a principle of re    demption in the bosoms of all living   that he is not an outward but   an inward redeemer  working out our salvation by   the change of   our depraved nature   that in and from him alone arise all the   sentiments and sensibilities that warm the heart with love  that   expand it with honour  that wring it with compunction  or that   heave it with the story of distant distress   and that he alone can   be qualified to be judge at the last day  who from the first day to   the last was internally a co operator and witness of all that ever   passed within the bosoms of all men      Hence it is  that although the Christian countries have received         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  395     the two tables of the laws of Christ  his external as well as internal   revelation  each witnessing to the other that the God of our gospel   is the God of our nature   the nations  however  who are strangers   to his name  yet acknowledge his influence  they do not indeed   hear  but they feel the precepts of  that light which lighteth   every man who cometh into the world       My dearest brother  said the earl  my conceptions are quite clear   with respect to the omnipresence of Christ s divinity  but as his   body is circumscribed by external features and lineaments  I can   form no notion of its being in several places at once   how then   will it be  I pray you  at and after the last day  Will he be   present to  and approachable only  by a select number of his saints     or will he go certain journeys and circuits through the heavens    blessing all in rotation with his beatific presence       Is not the body of yonder sun circumscribed  my lord  Most   certainly  It is now  said Mr  Clinton  at a distance of many   millions of leagues from you   and yet you see it as evidently    and feel its influence as powerfully  as if it were within your reach    Nay  it is more than within your reach  it is within your existence     it supplies comfort and life to your animal body and life   and   you could not survive an hour without its influence and operations      Now this is no other than the apt type and prefiguring promise   of what Christ will be to his new begotten in the resurrection      when corruption shall be swallowed up of glory  and mortal of   immortality   The same blessed body which  for the redemption   of commiserated sinners  went through the shameful and bloody   process of scourges  thorns  spittings  and buftetings   which hung   six agonizing hours on the cross   which descended into the grave    and thence opened the way through death into life  and through   time into eternity   even this body shall then shine forth in ineffable   beauty and beatitude  in essentially communicative grace and glory    through the height and through the depth  through the length   and through the breadth  beaming wide beyond the universe  from   infinity to infinity       Father  Son  and Holy Spirit will then become co embodied in   this divine body   they will be the repletion of it   they will operate   all things by it  To bring the Creator nearer to his creatures  the   invisible Godhead will then become visible  the infinite circum    scribed  the unapproachable accessible  and the incomprehensible   comprehended  within the humanity of our Christ      Then will his cross be exalted  for an ensign to the circling    bending  and worshipping universe  his wreath
