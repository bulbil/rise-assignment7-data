prince  recovering a little from his disorder by an effort of courage  resumed the discourse  and said to Blanche with a sigh    Madam  what have you done  You have destroyed me  and involved yourself in the same ruin by your credulity   Blanche was offended at the seeming reproaches of the king  when the strongest grounds of complaint were apparently on her side  What  my lord  answered she  do you add dissimulation to infidelity  Would you have me reject the evidence of my own eyes and ears  so as to believe you innocent in spite of their report  No  my lord  I will own to you such an effort of abstraction is not in my power  And yet  madam  replied the king  these witnesses by whose testimony you have been so fully convinced  are but impostors  They have been in a conspiracy to betray you  It is no less the fact that I am innocent and faithful  than it is true that you are married to the constable  What is it you say  my lord  replied she  Did I not overhear you confirming the pledge of your hand and heart to Constance  Have you not bound yourself to the nobility of the realm  and undertaken to comply with the will of the late king  Has not the princess received the homage of your new subjects as their queen  and in quality of bride to Prince Enriquez  Were my eyes then fascinated  Tell me  tell me rather  traitor  that Blanche was weighed as dust in the balance of your heart  when compared with the attractions of a throne  Without lowering yourself so far as to assume what you no longer feel  and what perhaps you never felt  own at once that the crown of Sicily appeared a more tenable possession with Constance than with the daughter of Leontio  You are in the right  my lord  My title to an illustrious throne  and to the heart of a prince like you  stands on an equally precarious footing  It was vanity in the extreme to prefer a claim to either  but you ought not to have drawn me on into error  You well recollect what alarms were my portion at the very thought of losing you  of which I had almost a supernatural foreboding  Why did you lull my apprehensions to sleep  To what purpose was that delusive mockery  I might else have accused fate rather than yourself  and you would at least have retained an interest in my heart  though unaccompanied by a hand which no other suitor could ever have obtained  As we are now circumstanced  your justification is out of season  I am married to the constable  To relieve me from the continuance of an interview  which casts a shade over my purity hitherto unsullied  permit me  my lord  without failing in due respect  to with draw from the presence of a prince to whose addresses I am no longer at liberty to listen   With these words  she darted away from Enriquez in as hurried a step as the agitation of her spirits would allow  Stop  madam  exclaimed he  drive not to despair a prince  inclined to overturn a throne  which you reproach him for having preferred to yourself  rather than yield to the importunities of his new subjects  That sacrifice is under present circumstances superfluous  rejoined Blanche  The bond must be broken between the constable and me  before any effect can be produced by these generous transports  Since I am not my own mistress  little would it avail that Sicily should be embroiled  nor does it concern me to whom you give your hand  If I have betrayed my own weakness  and suffered my heart to be surprised  at least shall I muster fortitude enough to suppress every soft emotion  and prove to the new king of Sicily  that the wife of the constable is no longer the mistress of Prince Enriquez  While this conversation was passing  they reached the park gate  With a sudden spring she and Nisa got within the walls  As they took care to fasten the wicket after them  the prince was left in a state of melancholy and stupefaction  He could not recover from the stunning sensation  occasioned by the intelligence of Blanche s marriage  Unjust may I well call you  exclaimed he  You have buried all remembrance of our solemn engagement  Spite of my protestations and your own  our fates are rent asunder  The long cherished hope of possessing those charms was an empty phantom  Ah  cruel as you are  how dearly have I purchased the distinction  of compelling you to acknowledge the constancy of my love   At that moment his rival s happiness  heightened by the colouring of jealousy  presented itself to his mind in all the horrors of that frantic passion  So arbitrary was its sway over him for some moments  that he was on the point of sacrificing the constable  and even Siffredi  to his blind vengeance  Reason  however  calmed by little and little the violence of his transports  And yet the obvious impossibility of effacing from the mind of Blanche her natural conviction of his infidelity  reduced him to despair  He flattered himself with weaning her from her prejudices  could he but converse with her secure from
