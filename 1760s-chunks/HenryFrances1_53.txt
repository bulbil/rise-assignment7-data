now to blaze into a Flame  and the Extravagance of your Passion seems to have spent itself to  The calm Lights of mild Philosophy   and  like the pure aetherial Spirit  can subsist without Matter  And here I must impose another Latin Sentence upon you  from Ovid   Quod nunc ratio est  impetus ante fuit     Your saying that you rejoice now in fine Weather  tho  all Seasons are equal to those who live in Town  because you know the Pleasure I receive from it  in the Country  puts me in Mind of a Pair of romantic Lovers  who agreed  at Parting  that  at such an Hour of the Night  they would each take a solitary Walk by Moonlight  enjoying a whimsical Kind of Happiness  in that they were both employed in contemplating the same Object  at the same Time  Such Instances as these  to Persons who never were in Love  may  perhaps  appear very ridiculous  but the charming Caprices of this delightful Passion  like the Taste  which Men of a refined Genius have for the politer Arts and Sciences  are as incomprehensible to Persons of   182 an ordinary Capacity  as the Objects of a sixth Sense   My lovely  loving  and beloved Fair one   farewell   Henry   LETTER CI   Dear HARRY   I Have entered upon the Study you prescribed to me  and have read Tully s Offices almost thro   and I profess myself both pleased and surprized  at finding to what a noble Height of virtuous Sentiment an uninlightened Pagan has carried the Point of Morals  Truth  and Justice  There are some extreme nice Cases put  in dealing between Man and Man  in which Cicero has determined so differently from the general Practice  and allowed Opinions of the mercantile World  that a Person must have a very refined and abstracted Speculation  who will readily join Issue with his Reasonings   I see now  more than ever  the Disadvantage in Morals  which People must labour under  who have not had the Happiness of a liberal and academic Education  who have not secured a thorough Knowledge of Books  before they venture upon any Acquaintance  or Commerce with the World  For it is in early Youth  before Ideas are crowded  or complexed  while the Fancy is lively  quick to receive  and amorous   183 to retain  the delicate Sensations  that the moral Beauty of abstract Virtue can be able to impress its Image on the Mind  and you might as well attempt to give a Man of Thirty a Taste for the nice and inexpressible Graces of Poetry  Painting  or Music  as to teach a Merchant a Relish for the Refinements of Cicero   However  I must confess  that the more I am pleased with this Author  and others of the same heathen Class  the more alarmed I find myself on Account of the Christian Religion  which  tho  allowed to be the finest and noblest System of Ethics that ever was framed  I really can t perceive any thing more in  than was said  wrote  and practised  before the Augustan Period  I have often heard Hints of the same Kind upon this Subject in Conversation  but they never made the least Impression on me before  because they never came from any Person  whom I did not observe to be deficient either in Sense or Virtue  Now  do not imagine  from any thing I say  that I am  in the least  staggered with Regard to my Faith in our holy Religion  but  as we should  upon all Occasions  be ready to give an Account of the Faith that is in us  I shall be obliged  if you will take the Trouble  to render me the Reason  or Necessity  for that Revelation  which  without having ever inquired about  I most stedfastly and implicitly believe in  Your Hours of Retirement and   184 Leisure have not been unemploy d upon these Subjects  and you are my Abelard  my only Orthodoxy in speculative Points   LETTER CII   My dear HELOISE   I Received your clever Letter upon those Subjects  which I left you conversant about  And  tho  I have already given you every Book from my Study  which I presumed might adorn a Lady s Library  I believe  I shall soon be obliged to thin my Shelves farther  and call in Aid from the Cotton Musaeum  to supply you   Your Criticism upon Taste is fine  and puts me in Mind of a very judicious Remark  I have somewhere met with  upon Julius Scaliger  who was allowed to be a Man of great Learning  and deep Erudition  but is observed to be but an heavy Commentator upon the inimitable Elegancies of the Classics    for that he applied himself to his Studies  somewhat too late in Life   There are in moral Virtue certain Graces  which it is not in the Power of Ethic Rules to prescribe  analogous to the Je ne sçay quoi of natural Beauty  which the most descriptive Poetry cannot express  and which a Person can be only capable of perceiving  from a sort of Sympathy of Soul  as refined   185 Spirits are supposed
