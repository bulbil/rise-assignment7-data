the temple of Fakku basi  In the course of experiments  he found that all black beards were electrical in the same degree  and being ignorant of philosophy  ascribed it to some supernatural virtue  in consequence of which they were promoted as the holiest of the Bonzas  But you and I know  that such a phosphorus is obtained from the most worthless and corrupted materials  such as rotten wood  putrefied veal  and stinking whiting      44 Fika kaka  such as I described him  could not possibly act in the character of Cuboy  without the assistance of counsellors and subalterns  who understood the detail of government and the forms of business  He was accordingly surrounded by a number of satellites  who reflected his lustre in their several spheres of rotation  and though their immersions and emersions were apparently abrubt and irregular  formed a kind of luminous belt as pale and comfortless as the ring of Saturn  the most distant  cold  and baleful of all the planets   The most remarkable of these subordinates  was Sti phi rum poo  a man  who  from a low plebeian origin  had raised himself to one of the first offices of the empire  to the dignity of Quo  or nobleman  and a considerable share of the Dairo s personal regard  He owed his whole success to his industry  assiduity  and circumspection     45 During the former part of his life  he studied the laws of Japan with such severity of application  that though unassisted by the least gleam of genius  and destitute of the smallest pretension to talent  he made himself master of all the written ordinances  all the established customs  and forms of proceeding in the different tribunals of the empire  In the progress of his vocation  he became an advocate of some eminence  and even acquired reputation for polemical eloquence  though his manner was ever dry  laboured  and unpleasant—Being elevated to the station of a judge  he so far justified the interest by which he had been promoted  that his honesty was never called in question  and his sentences were generally allowed to be just and upright  He heard causes with the most painful attention  seemed to be indefatigable in his researches after truth  and though he was forbidding in his aspect  slow    46 in deliberation  tedious in discussion  and cold in his address  yet I must own  he was also unbiassed in his decisions—I mean  unbiassed by any consciousness of sinister motive  for a man may be biassed by the nature of his disposition  as well as by prejudices acquired  and yet not guilty of intentional partiality  Sti phi rum poo was scrupulously just  according to his own ideas of justice  and consequently well qualified to decide in common controversies  But in delicate cases  which required an uncommon share of penetration  when the province of a supreme judge is to mitigate the severity  and sometimes even deviate from the dead letter of the common law  in favour of particular institutions  or of humanity in general  he had neither genius to enlighten his understanding  sentiment to elevate his mind  nor courage to surmount the petty inclosures of ordinary practice  He was accused of avarice and cruelty  but  in    47 fact  these were not active passions in his heart  The conduct which seemed to justify these imputations  was wholly owing to a total want of taste and generosity  The nature of his post furnished him with opportunities to accumulate riches  and as the narrowness of his mind admitted no ideas of elegance or refined pleasure  he knew not how to use his wealth so as to avoid the charge of a sordid disposition  His temper was not rapacious but retentive  he knew not the use of wealth  and therefore did not use it at all  but was in this particular neither better nor worse than a strong box for the convenience and advantage of his heir  The appearance of cruelty remarkable in his counsels  relating to some wretched insurgents who had been taken in open rebellion  and the rancorous pleasure he seemed to feel in pronouncing sentence of death by self    48 exenteration   was in fact the gratification of a dastardly heart  which had never acknowledged the least impulse of any liberal sentiment  This being the case  mankind ought not to impute that to his guilt which was  in effect  the consequence of his infirmity  A man might  with equal justice  be punished for being purblind  Sti phi rum poo was much more culpable for seeking to shine in a sphere for which nature never intended him  I mean for commencing statesman  and intermeddling in the machine of government  yet even into this character he was forced  as it were  by the opinion and injunctions of Fika kaka  who employed him at first in making speeches for the Dairo  which that prince used to pronounce in public  at certain    49 seasons of the year  These speeches being tolerably well received by the populace  the Cuboy conceived an extraordinary opinion of his talents  and thought him extremely well qualified to ease him of great part of the burthen of government  He found him very well disposed to engage heartily in his interests  Then he was admitted to the osculation a posteriori
