the  sober part of mankind feel to be extravagant outrages against the  laws of their country  and the peace of their fellow subjects  Having  staggered up to the table  the senior  who undertook to be spokesman   saluted Cadwallader with   How dost do  old Capricorn  Thou seem st  to be a most venerable pimp  and  I doubt not  hast abundance of  discretion  Here is this young whoremaster  a true chip of the old  venereal block his father  and myself  come for a comfortable cast  of thy function  I don t mean that stale pretence of conjuring  d    futurity  let us live for the present  old Haly  Conjure me up a couple  of hale wenches  and I warrant we shall get into the magic circle in a  twinkling  What says Galileo  What says the Reverend Brahe  Here is a  purse  you pimp  Hark  how it chinks  This is sweeter than the music of  spheres    Our necromancer  perplexed at this rencontre  made no reply  but  taking  up his wand  waved it around his head in a very mysterious motion  with    6 22 15  3 45 PM   a view of intimidating these forward visitants  who  far from being awed  by this sort of evolution  became more and more obstreperous  and even  threatened to pull him by the beard  if he would not immediately comply  with their desire  Had he called his associate  or even Hadgi  to his  aid  he knew he could have soon calmed their turbulence  but  being  unwilling to run the risk of a discovery  or even of a riot  he  bethought himself of chastising their insolence in another manner  that  would be less hazardous  and rather more effectual  In consequence of  this suggestion  he pointed his wand towards the door of the  apartment in which the ladies had taken sanctuary  and the two rakes   understanding the hint  rushed in without hesitation   The females  finding their place of retreat taken by assault  ran about  the room in great consternation  and were immediately taken prisoners  by the assailants  who  pulling them towards the windows  opened the  shutters at the same instant of time  when  strange to tell  one of the  heroes discovered in the prize he had made  the very wife of his bosom   and his companion perceived that he had stumbled in the dark upon  his own mother  Their mutual astonishment was unspeakable at this  eclaircissement  which produced a universal silence for the space  of several minutes  During this pause  the ladies having recollected  themselves  an expostulation was begun by the elder of the two  who  roundly took her son to task for his disorderly life  which laid her  under the disagreeable necessity of watching his motions  and detecting  him in such an infamous place   While the careful mother thus exercised her talent for reprehension   the hopeful young gentleman  with a hand in each fob  stood whistling  an opera tune  without seeming to pay the most profound regard to his  parent s reproof  and the other lady  in imitation of such a consummate  pattern  began to open upon her husband  whom she bitterly reproached  with his looseness and intemperance  demanding to know what he had to  allege in alleviation of his present misconduct  The surprise occasioned  by such an unexpected meeting  had already  in a great measure   destroyed the effects of the wine he had so plentifully drunk  and  the first use he made of his recovered sobriety  was to revolve within  himself the motives that could possibly induce his wife to give him  the rendezvous in this manner  As he had good reason to believe she  was utterly void of jealousy  he naturally placed this rencontre to the  account of another passion  and his chagrin was not at all impaired by  the effrontery with which she now presumed to reprimand him  He listened  to her  therefore  with a grave  or rather grim  aspect  and to the  question with which she concluded her rebuke  answered  with great  composure   All that I have to allege  madam  is  that the bawd has  committed a mistake  in consequence of which we are both disappointed   and so  ladies  your humble servant   So saying  he retired  with  manifest confusion in his looks  and  as he passed through the  audience chamber  eyeing the conjurer askance  pronounced the epithet  of precious rascal  with great emphasis  Meanwhile  the junior  like  a dutiful child  handed his mamma to her chair  and the other client   after having reviled the necromancer  because he could not foresee this  event  went away in a state of mortification   The coast being clear  Peregrine came forth from his den  and  congratulated his friend upon the peaceable issue of the adventure   which he had overheard  but  that he might not be exposed to such  inconvenience for
