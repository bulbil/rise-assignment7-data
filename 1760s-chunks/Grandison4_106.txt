Or when he would return  And see  now  how angry he looks   He traversed the room—I went on—Did he not shake off my hand  when I laid it  smiling  on his arm  Would he answer me a question  which I kindly put to him  fearing he had not dined  and might be sick for want of eating  Was I not forced to apply to Lady L  for an answer to my careful question  on his scornfully turning from me in silence —Might we not  if he had not gone out so abruptly  nobody knows where  have made the appearance his heart is so set upon —But now  indeed  it is too late   Oons  madam  said he  and he kemboed his arms  and strutted up to me  Now for a cuff  thought I  I was half afraid of it  But out of the room again capered he   Lord bless me  said I  What a passionate creature is this   Lord and Lady L  both turned from me with indignation    264 But no wonder if one  that they both did  They are a silly pair  and I believe have agreed to keep each other in countenance in all they do   But Emily affected me  She sat before in one corner of the room  weeping  and just then ran to me  and  wrapping her arms about me  Dear  dear Lady G  said she  for Heaven s sake  think of what our Miss Byron said     Don t jest away your own happiness    I don t say who is in fault  But  my de•r Lady  do you condescend  It looks pretty in a 〈◊〉 man to condescend  Forgive me  I will run to my Lord  and I will beg of him—    Away she ran  without waiting for an answer—and  bringing in the passionate wret•h  hanging on his arm—You must not  my Lord  indeed you must not be so passionate  Why  my Lord  you highted me  indeed you did  Such a word I never heard from your Lordship s mouth —  Why  my Lord  said I  you give yourself pretty airs▪ Don t you  and use pretty words  that a ch•ld shall be terrified at them  But come  come  ask my pardon  for leaving me to dine without you   Was not that tender —Yet out went Lord and Lady L  To be sure they did right  if they withdrew in hopes these kind words would have been received as reconciliatory ones  and not in displeasure with me  as I am half afraid they did  For their good nature  worthy souls  does sometimes lead them into misapprehensions  I kindly laid my hand on his arm again —He was ungracious —Nay  my Lord  don t once more reject me with disdain—If you do—I then smiled most courteously  Carry not your absurdities  my Lord  too far  And I took his hand  There  Harriet  was condescension    I protest  Sir  if you give yourself any more of these airs  you will not find me so condescending —Come  come  tell me you are sorry  and I will forgive you   Sorry  madam  sorry —I am indeed sorry  for our provoking airs     265 Why that s not ill said—But kemboed arms  my Lord  are you not sorry for such an air  And Oons  are you not sorry for such a word  and for such looks too  and for quarrelling with your dinner —I protest  my Lord  you make one of us look like a child who flings away his bread and butter because it has not glass windows upon it —  Not for one moment forbear  madam —  Pr ythee  pr ythee— I profess I had like to have said honest friend  No more of these airs  and  I tell you  I will forgive you   But  madam  I cannot  I will not—  Hush  hush▪ no more in that strain  and so loud  as if we had le•t each other in a wood —If you will let us be frien••  say so—In an instant—If not  I am gone—gone this moment—casting off from him  as I may say  intending to mount up stairs   Angel  or Demon  shall I call you  said he —Yet I receive your hand  as offered  But  for God s sake  madam  let us be happy  And he kissed my hand  but not so cordially as it became him to do  and in came Lord and Lady L  with countenances a little ungracious   I took my seat next my own man  with an air of officiousness  hoping to oblige him by it  and he was obliged  And another day  not yet quite agreed upon  this parade is to be made   And thus began  proceeded  and ended  this doughty quarrel  And who knows  but before the day is absolutely resolved upon  we may have half a score more  Four  five  six days  as it may happen  is a great space of time for people
