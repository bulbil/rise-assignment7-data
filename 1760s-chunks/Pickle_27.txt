seeing Lady Stately s equipage  arrive  she suddenly fainted away  Her husband  whose vanity had never  been so perfectly gratified as with this promised harvest of his own  sowing  took the alarm immediately  and in order to prevent relapses of  that kind  which might be attended with fatal consequence to his hope   gave her leave to bespeak a coach  horses  and liveries  to her own  liking  Thus authorized  she in a very little time exhibited such a  specimen of her own taste and magnificence as afforded speculation to  the whole country  and made Trunnion s heart quake within him  because  he foresaw no limits to her extravagance which also manifested itself in  the most expensive preparations for her lying in   Her pride  which had hitherto regarded the representative of her  father s house  seemed now to lose all that hereditary respect  and  prompt her to outshine and undervalue the elder branch of her family   She behaved to Mrs  Pickle with a sort of civil reserve that implied a  conscious superiority  and an emulation in point of grandeur immediately  commenced between the two sisters  She every day communicated her  importance to the whole parish  under pretence of taking the air in    6 22 15  3 45 PM   her coach  and endeavoured to extend her acquaintance among people of  fashion  Nor was this an undertaking attended with great difficulty  for  all persons whatever capable of maintaining a certain appearance  will  always find admission into what is called the best company  and be  rated in point of character according to their own valuation  without  subjecting their pretensions to the smallest doubt or examination  In  all her visits and parties she seized every opportunity of declaring her  present condition  observing that she was forbid by her physicians to  taste such a pickle  and that such a dish was poison to a woman in her  way  nay  where she was on a footing of familiarity  she affected to  make wry faces  and complained that the young rogue began to be very  unruly  writhing herself into divers contortions  as if she had been  grievously incommoded by the mettle of this future Trunnion  The husband  himself did not behave with all the moderation that might have been  expected  At the club he frequently mentioned this circumstance of his  own vigour as a pretty successful feat to be performed by an old fellow  of fifty five  and confirmed the opinion of his strength by redoubled  squeezes of the landlord s hand  which never failed of extorting a  satisfactory certificate of his might  When his companions drank to the  Hans en kelder  or Jack in the low cellar  he could not help displaying  an extraordinary complacence of countenance  and signified his intention  of sending the young dog to sea as soon as he should be able to carry a  cartridge  in hopes of seeing him an officer before his own death   This hope helped to console him under the extraordinary expense to  which he was exposed by the profusion of his wife  especially when he  considered that his compliance with her prodigality would be limited to  the expiration of the nine months  of which the best part was by this  time elapsed  yet  in spite of all this philosophical resignation  her  fancy sometimes soared to such a ridiculous and intolerable pitch of  insolence and absurdity  that his temper forsook him  and he could  not help wishing in secret that her pride might be confounded in the  dissipation of her most flattering hopes  even though he himself should  be a principal sufferer by the disappointment  These  however  were no  other than the suggestions of temporary disgusts  that commonly subsided  as suddenly as they arose  and never gave the least disturbance to the  person who inspired them  because he took care to conceal them carefully  from her knowledge   Meanwhile she happily advanced in her reckoning  with the promise of a  favourable issue  the term of her computation expired  and in the middle  of the night she was visited by certain warnings that seemed to bespeak  the approach of the critical moment  The commodore got up with great  alacrity  and called the midwife  who had been several days in the  house  the gossips were immediately summoned  and the most interesting  expectations prevailed  but the symptoms of labour gradually vanished   and as the matrons sagely observed  this was no more than a false alarm   Two nights after they received a second intimation  and as she was  sensibly diminished in the waist  everything was supposed to be in a  fair way  yet this visitation was not more conclusive than the former   her pains wore off in spite of all her endeavours to encourage them   and the good women betook themselves to their respective homes  in  expectation of finding the third attack decisive  alluding to the  well known maxim  that  number three is always fortunate   For once   however  this apophthegm failed  the next call was altogether as  ineffectual as the former  and moreover  attended with a phenomenon
