answer  in person  to the complaint which was brought against him by the merchant  Upon subjects equally trivial he sent six different summons  at different times  in one year  so that the Scotch King soon perceived himself only possessed of the name  without the authority  Willing  therefore  to shake off so troublesome a master  Baliol revolted  and procured the Pope s absolution for the infraction of his former oaths of homage  Edward now offered the crown to Bruce  who accepted it with joy  and thus a strong party of the Scotch was added in strengthening the English King to subdue their native country  Edward  at the head of a numerous army  marched into the country  numberless were the victories gained on one side and the other  in which the conquerors acquired much honour  but either country lost the bravest of its subjects  But wars like these  though minutely related by every historian  are scarce worth treasuring in any memory  but that of an herald or antiquarian  The whole may be comprized in the following short description  one barbarous nation meets another in some plain  generally by mutual appointment  little art  evolution  evasion  or subterfuge  was practised or known  they rushed upon each other  and numbers and tumult generally decided the victory  the revolutions of the government  and not the description of battles fought in these reigns  serve to adorn the  of   112 history  At one season Scotland was brought to the lowest degree of humiliation  and Edward had laid a plan  which probably he ever had in view  of uniting  it as a conquest  to the crown of England  But his scheme proved abortive  the time of that kingdom s deliverance was at hand  they found safety in despair  and  upon the King s return to England  they once more sallied down from their mountains upon the English army which he had left  and gained a complete victory   This was terrible news to Edward  who had already built upon that kingdom as his own  He was now implacably exasperated against the Scots  and resolved to take a signal vengeance  to this purpose  he summoned all the vassals of the crown  without distinction  to be ready at a time and place particularly appointed  His intention was  to march into the heart of that kingdom  and destroy it  to use his own expression  from sea to sea  He soon saw himself at the head of the finest army England had ever produced  the Scotch trembled at his approach  but death stopped the course of his intended devastations   As soon as he perceived that his disorder was to be fatal  he sent for the Prince his son  whom he had appointed to succeed him  and  taking him by the hand  earnestly recommended  with his dying breath  three things  he first enjoined him not to recal Gavestone  a flatterer  who he knew would poison his principles  he next desired  that his heart might be sent to the holy sepulchre  and  thirdly  he recommended him to prosecute the war with the Scotch  till he had entirely subdued them  desiring his bones might be carried about at the head of the army  the more effectually to strike terror into an enemy he had so often subdued     113 England began to grow truly formidable under this reign  the opposition of the barons was but feeble and ill supported  the Monarch was  in some measure  absolute  though he was prudent enough never to exert his power  he is accused of severity  and it is probable he might have exerted justice with too heavy an hand  yet it should be particularly remarked  that he was the first who began to dispense indiscriminate justice  Before him  the people who rose in insurrections were punished in the most severe manner  by the sword or the gibbet  while the nobility  who were almost always refractory  were treated with a degree of lenity which encouraged future disobedience  a small fine  which  in fact  only fell upon their poor dependants  generally wiped off their offences  He punished both with equal severity   However  you ought to remark the alterations in the spirit of the times  the English  now incorporated with their fierce Norman conquerors  were no longer the tame consenting people they formerly appeared  and always were prepared to elude that authority which they could not resist  With this spirit of opposition a spirit of cruelty also seemed to enter  regardless of their own lives  the people did not seem very sollicitous about the lives of others  The penal laws now began to assume more rigour  in the times of William the Conqueror  it was a law  that no man should be punished with death  but that law was at present quite laid aside  and several crimes were rendered capital   But what gave the reign of Edward a true value with posterity  was the degree of power the people began to assume during this period  The clergy and the barons he considered  in some measure  as rivals  and  to weaken their force  he gave authority   114 to the commons  a law was enacted  by which no tax could be levied without their consent
