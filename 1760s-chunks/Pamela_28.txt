 but said  I don t know how it is  but I see with different eyes from   other people  for I have heard much more talk of her prettiness  than   I think it deserves  She is well enough  as I said  but her greatest   excellence is  that she is humble  and courteous  and faithful  and   makes all her fellow servants love her  My housekeeper  in particular    doats upon her  and you know  ladies  she is a woman of discernment    And  as for Mr  Longman  and Jonathan  here  if they thought themselves   young enough  I am told  they would fight for her  Is it not true    Jonathan  Troth  sir  said he  an t please your honour  I never knew   her peer  and all your honour s family are of the same mind  Do you hear   now  said my master   Well  said the ladies  we will make a visit to   Mrs  Jervis by and by  and hope to see this paragon       I believe they are coming  and will tell you the rest by and by  I wish   they had come  and were gone  Why can t they make their game without me       Well  these fine ladies have been here  and are gone back again  I would   have been absent  if I could  and did step into the closet  so they saw   me when they came in       There were four of them  Lady Arthur at the great white house on the   hill  Lady Brooks  Lady Towers  and the other  it seems  a countess  of   some hard name  I forget what       So Mrs  Jervis  says one of the ladies  how do you do  We are all come   to inquire after your health  I am much obliged to your ladyships    said Mrs  Jervis  Will your ladyships please to sit down  But  said   the countess  we are not only come to ask after Mrs  Jervis s health   neither  but we are come to see a rarity besides  Ah  says Lady Arthur    I have not seen your Pamela these two years  and they tell me she is   grown wondrous pretty in that time       Then I wished I had not been in the closet  for when I came out  they   must needs know I heard them  but I have often found  that bashful   bodies owe themselves a spite  and frequently confound themselves more    by endeavouring to avoid confusion       Why  yes  says Mrs  Jervis  Pamela is very pretty indeed  she s but in   the closet there   Pamela  pray step hither  I came out all covered with   blushes  and they smiled at one another       The countess took me by the hand  Why  indeed  she was pleased to say    report has not been too lavish  I ll assure you  Don t be ashamed    child   and stared full in my face   I wish I had just such a face to be   ashamed of  O how like a fool I looked       Lady Arthur said  Ay  my good Pamela  I say as her ladyship says  Don t   be so confused  though  indeed  it becomes you too  I think your good   lady departed made a sweet choice of such a pretty attendant  She would   have been mighty proud of you  as she always was praising you  had she   lived till now       Ah  madam  said Lady Brooks  do you think that so dutiful a son as our   neighbour  who always admired what his mother loved  does not pride   himself  for all what he said at table  in such a pretty maiden       She looked with such a malicious sneering countenance  I can t abide   her       Lady Towers said with a free air   for it seems she is called a wit     Well  Mrs  Pamela  I can t say I like you so well as these ladies do    for I should never care  if you were my servant  to have you and your   master in the same house together  Then they all set up a great laugh       I know what I could have said  if I durst  But they are ladies  and   ladies may say any thing       Says Lady Towers  Can the pretty image speak  Mrs  Jervis  I vow she has   speaking eyes  O you little rogue  said she  and tapped me on
