      Let me write  and bewail my miserable hard fate  though I have no hope   how what I write can be conveyed to your hands   I have now nothing to   do  but write and weep  and fear and pray  But yet what can I hope for    when I seem to be devoted  as a victim to the will of a wicked violator   of all the laws of God and man   But  gracious Heaven  forgive me my   rashness and despondency  O let me not sin against thee  for thou best   knowest what is fittest for thy poor handmaid   And as thou sufferest   not thy poor creatures to be tempted above what they can bear  I will   resign myself to thy good pleasure  And still  I hope  desperate as my   condition seems  that as these trials are not of my own seeking  nor   the effects of my presumption and vanity  I shall be enabled to overcome   them  and  in God s own good time  be delivered from them       Thus do I pray imperfectly  as I am forced by my distracting fears and   apprehensions  and O join with me  my dear parents   But  alas  how can   you know  how can I reveal to you  the dreadful situation of your poor   daughter  The unhappy Pamela may be undone  which God forbid  and sooner   deprive me of life   before you can know her hard lot       O the unparalleled wickedness  stratagems  and devices  of those who   call themselves gentlemen  yet pervert the design of Providence  in   giving them ample means to do good  to their own everlasting perdition    and the ruin of poor oppressed innocence       But now I will tell you what has befallen me  and yet  how shall you   receive it  Here is no honest John to carry my letters to you  And    besides  I am watched in all my steps  and no doubt shall be  till my   hard fate may ripen his wicked projects for my ruin  I will every day    however  write my sad state  and some way  perhaps  may be opened to   send the melancholy scribble to you  But  alas  when you know it  what   will it do but aggravate your troubles  For  O  what can the abject poor   do against the mighty rich  when they are determined to oppress       Well  but I must proceed to write what I had hoped to tell you in a few   hours  when I believed I should receive your grateful blessings  on my   return to you from so many hardships       I will begin with my account from the last letter I wrote you  in which   I enclosed my poor stuff of verses  and continue it at times  as I have   opportunity  though  as I said  I know not how it can reach you       The long hoped for Thursday morning came  when I was to set out  I had   taken my leave of my fellow servants overnight  and a mournful leave   it was to us all  for men  as well as women servants  wept much to   part with me  and  for my part  I was overwhelmed with tears  and the   affecting instances of their esteem  They all would have made me little   presents  as tokens of their love  but I would not take any thing from   the lower servants  to be sure  But Mr  Longman would have me accept of   several yards of Holland  and a silver snuff box  and a gold ring  which   he desired me to keep for his sake  and he wept over me  but said  I am   sure so good a maiden God will bless  and though you return to your   poor father again  and his low estate  yet Providence will find you out    Remember I tell you so  and one day  though I mayn t live to see it  you   will be rewarded       I said  O  dear Mr  Longman  you make me too rich  and too mody  and   yet I must be a beggar before my time for I shall want often to be   scribbling   little thinking it would be my only employment so soon     and I will beg you  sir  to favour me with some paper  and  as soon as I   get home  I will write you a letter  to thank you for all your kindness   to me  and a letter to good Mrs  Jervis too       This was lucky  for I should have had none else  but at
