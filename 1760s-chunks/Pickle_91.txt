be upon his guard against the fair weather of the  French politesse  which was no more to be trusted than a whirlpool at  sea  He observed that many young men had gone to Paris with good cargoes  of sense  and returned with a great deal of canvas  and no ballast  at all  whereby they became crank all the days of their lives  and  sometimes carried their keels above water  He desired Mr  Jolter to keep  his pupil out of the clutches of those sharking priests who lie in wait  to make converts of all young strangers  and in a particular manner  cautioned the youth against carnal conversation with the Parisian dames   who  he understood  were no better than gaudy fire ships ready primed  with death and destruction   Peregrine listened with great respect  thanking him for his kind  admonitions  which he faithfully promised to observe  The halted and  breakfasted at the end of the stage  where Jolter provided himself with  a horse  and the commodore settled the method of corresponding with his  nephew  The minute of parting being arrived  the old commander wrung his  godson by the hand  saying   I wish thee a prosperous voyage and good  cheer  my lad  my timbers are now a little crazy  d ye see  and God  knows if I shall keep afloat till such time as I see thee again  but  howsomever  hap what will  thou wilt find thyself in a condition to keep  in the line with the rest of thy fellows   He then reminded Gauntlet  of his promise to call at the garrison in his return from Dover  and  imparted something in a whisper to the governor  while Jack Hatchway   unable to speak  pulled his hat over his eyes  and  squeezing Peregrine  by the hand  gave him a pistol of curious workmanship  as a memorial  of his friendship  Our youth  who was not unmoved on this occasion   received the pledge  which he acknowledged with the present of a  tobacco box bought for this purpose  and the two lads of the castle  getting into the coach  were driven homewards  in a state of silent  dejection   Godfrey and Peregrine seated themselves in the post chaise  and Jolter   the valet de chambre  and lacquey  bestriding their beasts  they  proceeded for the place of their destination  at which they arrived in  safety that same night  and bespoke a passage in the packet boat which  was to sail next day   CHAPTER XXXIV   He adjusts the Method of his Correspondence with Gauntlet  meets by  accident with an Italian Charlatan  and a certain Apothecary  who proves  to be a noted Character   There the two friends adjusted the articles of a future correspondence   and Peregrine  having written a letter to his mistress  wherein he  renewed his former vows of eternal fidelity  it was intrusted to the    6 22 15  3 45 PM   care of her brother  while Mr  Jolter  at the desire of his pupil   provided an elegant supper  and some excellent Burgundy  that they might  spend this eve of his departure with the greater enjoyment   Things being thus disposed  and a servant employed in laying the cloth   their ears were of a sudden invaded by a strange tumultuous noise in the  next room  occasioned by the overthrow of tables  chairs  and glasses   with odd unintelligible exclamations in broken French  and a jargon of  threats in the Welsh dialect  Our young gentlemen ran immediately into  the apartment from whence this clamour seemed to proceed  and found a  thin  meagre  swarthy figure  gasping  in all the agony of fear  under  the hands of a squat  thick  hard featured man  who collared him with  great demonstrations of wrath  saying   If you was as mighty a magician  as Owen Glendower or the witch of Entor  look you  ay  ay  or as Paul  Beor himself  I will meke pold  by the assistance of Got  and in his  majesty s name  to seize and secure  and confine and confront you  until  such time as you suffer and endure and undergo the pains and penalties  of the law  for your diabolical practices  Shentlements   added he   turning to our adventurers   I take you to witness  that I protest  and  assert  and avow  that this person is as pig a necromancer as you would  desire to behold  and I supplicate  and beseech  and entreat of you   that he may be prought pefore his petters  and compelled to give an  account of his compact and commerce with the imps of darkness  look you   for  as I am a Christian soul  and hope for joyful resurrection  I have  this plessed evening seen him perform such things as could not be done  without the aid and instruction and connivance of the tevil    Gauntlet seemed to enter into the sentiments of this Welsh reformer   and actually laid hold on the delinquent s shoulder
