reason  You promised me a good situation provided I abjured poetry  but I have found a very excellent one  on condition of keeping my talents in constant play  I accepted the latter alternative  as squaring best with my own humour  A friend of mine got me an employment under Don Bertrand Gomez Del Ribero  treasurer of the king s galleys  This Don Bertrand  wanting to have a wit in his pay  and finding my turn for poetical composition very much in unison with his own sense of what is excellent  has chosen me in preference to five or six authors who offered themselves as candidates for the place of his private secretary   I am delighted at the news  my dear Fabricio  said I  for this Don Bertrand must be very rich  Rich indeed  answered he  they say that he does not know himself how much he is worth  However that may be  my business under him is as follows  He prides himself on his turn for gallantry  at the same time wishing to pass for a man of genius  he therefore keeps up an epistolary intercourse of wit with several ladies who have an infinite deal  and borrows my brain to indite such letters as may amplify the opinion of his sprightliness and elegance  I write to one for him in verse  to another in prose  and sometimes carry the letters myself  to prove the agility of my heels as well as the ingenuity of my head   But you do not tell me  said I  what I most want to know  Are you well paid for your epigrammatic cards of compliment  Yes  most plentifully  answered he  Rich men are not always open handed  and I know some who are downright curmudgeons  but Don Bertrand has behaved in the most handsome manner  Besides a salary of two hundred pistoles  I receive some little occasional perquisites from him  sufficient to set me above the world  and enable me to live on an equal footing with some choice spirits of the literary circles  who are willing  like myself  to set care at defiance  But then  resumed I  has your treasurer critical skill enough to distinguish the beauties of a performance from its blemishes  The least likely man in the world  answered Nunez  a flippant tongued smatterer  with a miserable assortment of materials for judging  Yet he gives himself out for chief justice and lord president of Apollo s tribunal  His decisions are adventurous  if not always lucky  while his opinions are maintained in so high a tone and with so bullying a challenge of infallibility  that nine times out of ten the issue of an argument is silence  though not conviction  on the part of the opponent  as a measure of precaution against the gathering storm of foul language and contemptuous sneers   You may readily suppose  continued he  that I take especial care never to contradict him  though it almost exceeds human patience to forbear  for  to say nothing of the unpalatable phrases that might be hailed down on my defenceless head  I should stand a very good chance of being shoved by the shoulders out of doors  I therefore am discreet enough to approve what he praises  and to condemn without mitigation or appeal whatever he is pleased to find fault with  By this easy compliance  for poets are compelled to acquire a knack of knocking under to those by whom they live  not even excepting their booksellers  I have gained the esteem and friendship of my patron  He has employed me to write a tragedy on a plot of his own  I have executed it under his inspection  and if the piece succeeds  a percentage on the laud and honour must accrue to him   I asked our poet what was the title of his tragedy  He informed me that it was  The Count of Saldagna   and that it would come out in two or three days  I told him that I wished it all possible success  and thought so favour ably of his genius  as to entertain considerable hopes  So do I  said he  but hope never tells a more flattering tale than in the ear of a dramatic author  You might as well attempt to fix the wind by nailing the weathercock  as speculate on the reception of a new piece with an audience   At length  the day of performance arrived  I could not go to the play  being prevented by official business  The only thing to be done was to send Scipio  that he might bring me back word how it went off  for I was sincerely interested in the event  After waiting impatiently for his return  in he came with a long face which boded no good  Well  said I  how was  The Count of Saldagna  welcomed by the critics  Very roughly  answered he  never was there a play more brutally handled  I left the house in high anger at the injustice and insolence of the pit  It serves him right  rejoined I  Nunez is no better than a madman  to he always running his head against the stone walls of a theatre  If he was in his senses  could he have preferred the hisses and catcalls of an unfeeling mob  to the ease and dignity he might
