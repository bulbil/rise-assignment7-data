In like manner  from the same defects in understanding  some of us women act as if we thought coyness and modesty the same thing  and others  as if they were sensible  that if they were not insolent  they must drop into the arms of a Lover upon his first question   But Miss Grandison  in her behaviour to Lord G  is governed by motives of archness  and  I may say  downright roguery of temper  Courtship is play to her  She has a talent for raillery  and in no instance is so successful  yet so improper  as on that subject  She could not spare her brother upon it  tho  she suffered by it   Yet had she a respect for Lord G  she could not treat him ludicrously  Cannot a witty woman find her own consequence  but by putting a fool s coat on the back of a friend —Sterling wit  I imagine  requires not a foil to set it off   She is indeed good natured  and this is all Lord G  has to depend upon—Saving a little reliance that he may make upon the influence her brother has over her  I told her  just now  that were I Lord G  I would not wish to have her mine  on any consideration  She called me silly creature  and asked me  If it were not one of the truest signs of Love  when men were most fond of the women who were least fit for them  and used them worst  These men  my dear  said she  are very sorry creatures  and know no medium  They will either  spaniel like  fawn at your feet  or be ready to leap into your lap   She has charming spirits  I wish I could borrow   233 some of them  But I tell her  that I would not have a single drachm of those over lively ones which I see she will play off upon Lord G  Yet he will be pleased  at present  with any treatment from her  tho  he wants not feeling  as I can see already—Don t  Charlotte  said I to her  within this half hour  let him find his own weight in your levity  He admires your wit  but don t let it wound him   But perhaps she is the sprightlier  in order to give me  and Lord and Lady L  spirits  They are very good to me  and greatly apprehensive of the story  which takes up  in a manner  my whole attention  So is Miss Grandison  And my sweet Emily  as often as she may  comes up to me when I am alone  and hangs upon my arm  my shoulder  and watches  with looks of Love  every turn of my eyes   I have opened my whole heart to her  for the better guarding of hers  and this history of Clementina affords an excellent lesson for the good girl  She blesses me for the lectures I read her on this subject  and says  that she sees Love is a very subtile thing  and  like water  will work its way into the banks that are set up to confine it  if it be not watched  and damned out in time   She pities Clementina  and prettily asked my leave to do so  I think  said she  my heart loves her  but not so well as it does you  I long to know what my guardian will do about her  How good is it in her father and mother to love her so dearly  Her two elder brothers one cannot dislike  but Jeronymo is my favourite  He is a man worth saving  i n t he  madam  But I pity her father and mother  as well as Clementina   Charming young creature  What an excellent heart she has   Sir Charles is to dine with Sir Hargrave and his friends to morrow  on the forest  in his way to Grandison hall  The doctor says  he expects to hear from him  when there  What  will he go by this house    234 and not call in —With all my heart—We are only sisters  Miss Grandison says  she ll be hanged  that is her word  if he is not afraid of me  Afraid of me  A sign  if he is  he knows not what a poor forward creature I am  But as he seems to be pre engagged—Well  but I shall soon know every thing  as to that  But sure he might call in  as he went by   The doctor says  he longs to know how he approves of the decorations of his church  and of the alterations that are made and making  by his direction  at the Hall  It is a wonder  methinks  that he takes not Dr  Bartlett with him  Upon my word  I think he is a little unaccountable  such sisters as he has  Should you like it  Lucy  were he your brother  I really think his sisters are too acquiescent   He has a great taste  the doctor tells us  yet not an expensive one  for he studies situation and convenience  and pretends not to
