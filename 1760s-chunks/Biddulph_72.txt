 I found my mother at the house in St James’s street  where I now am  she got here late last night  and my letter had thrown her into agonies  from which she had not yet recovered  What have you wrote to me  said she  as she held me in her arms  your dreadful letter has almost killed me—Sure  sure  my dear child  it cannot be true that you have left your husband  What is the cause  What have you done  or  What has he done  I begged my mother to compose herself a little  and then related to her every circumstance  in the same manner you have had them as they occurred  Her lamentations pierced my heart  she wrung her hands in bitterness of anguish  Why did not the grave hide me  said she  before I saw shame and sorrow heaped upon my child  I came to die in peace with you—You might have lengthened my days for a while—But you cut them off—My eyes will close in affliction—A wounded spirit who can bear  Had you died in your cradle  we had both been happy  My child would now have been a cherub  an angel you would have been in my eyes  and I am punished for it  but that was my crime  not your’s  But you are a martyr to the crimes of others   My mother wept not all this time  I wished she had  her passionate looks and tones affected me more than tears could  My eyes began to run over  her’s soon accompanied me  and it a little relieved the vehemence of her grief   She then began to reproach herself for having listened to lady Grimston’s suggestions in favour of Mr Arnold  and for her own solliciting this fatal marriage  But I stopped her  on a subject which I knew would so much torment her thoughts  I conjured her not to reflect on it in that manner  I told her I knew she had acted for the best  and that nothing but an extraordinary fatality  which could neither be foreseen nor avoided  had made me unhappy  I said I was sure Mr Arnold had been seduced by the wiles of a wicked woman  for that he was by nature a good man  and that he had more of my pity than of my resentment     I found it necessary to reconcile my mother to herself on this head  she seemed willing to lay hold on the hint  and turned all her indignation against Mrs Gerrarde  A practised sinner  she called her  for whom nothing could be said in extenuation of her crime   We now turned our thoughts towards fixing on some other abode  You may be sure Mr Arnold’s house is no place for us  and my mother declared she would not stay another night in it  accordingly we have dispatched her maid to take us lodgings immediately   September 21  We have quickly shifted the scene  my dear Cecilia  and are settled  at least for the present  in very handsome lodgings in St Alban’s street  We came to them last night  and my mother seems a little less disturbed than she was  I pray God spare her life  but I fear I shall not long enjoy that blessing  She is sadly altered since I last saw her  a dropsical complaint is stealing on her fast  her legs are swelled  and she has intirely lost her appetite  yet if her mind were a little more at ease  I should hope  that by the assistance she can have here  she might be enabled to hold out against this disorder for a good while  I endeavour to suppress my own grief  that I may not increase her’s     VOLUME II      September 21  I was surprized to day by a visitor to my mother  Miss Burchell came to pay her respects to her  I have told you they corresponded  My mother  it seems  had given her notice of the time she intended being in town  the young lady had been to wait on her in St James’s Street  and was from thence directed by the servant  who kept the house  to our new lodgings   She is really a very lovely young woman  and there is something so insinuating in her manner  that there is no seeing her without being prejudiced in her favour  She changed colour when my mother presented me to her by my name  but  at the same time  surveyed me with a scrutinous eye  My mother asked her  had she seen Mr Faulkland since his return to England  She answered  No  with a sigh  but that she believed he had been to Putney  To see his son  said my mother  without reflecting  that Miss Burchell had avoided mentioning that circumstance  and stopped upon naming the place where the child was at nurse  Yes  she replied  in a timorous accent  and stealing a look at me  The woman told me  that a young gentleman had been there about six weeks ago  who said he came from the child’s father abroad  and made her a handsome present  As I did not then know Mr Faulkland was returned to England  I should not have suspected it was
