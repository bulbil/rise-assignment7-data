I was on the brink of forfeiting all pretensions to their regard  by  committing another fatal error  which could not possibly be retrieved   and that  for his part  whatever pangs it might cost him  he was  resolved to banish me from his sight for ever    While he uttered this declaration  the tears trickled down his cheeks   and he seemed overwhelmed with the keenest sorrow and mortification   so it may be easily conceived what were the impressions of my grief   reinforced with the affliction of a father whom I dearly loved  and the  consciousness of being the cause of all his disquiet  I was struck dumb  with remorse and woe  and  when I recovered the use of speech  I told  him how sensible I was of his great goodness and humanity  and owned  how little I deserved his favour and affection  that the sense of my own  unworthiness was one cause of my present distraction  for such was the  condition of my fate  that I must either see S   or die  I said   though I could not expect his forgiveness  I was surely worthy of his  compassion  that nothing but the most irresistible passion could have  misled me at first from my duty  or tempted me to incur the least degree  of his displeasure  that the same fatal influence still prevailed  and  would  in all probability  continue to the grave  which was the only  abode in which I hoped for peace    While I expressed myself in this manner  my dear good father wept with  the most tender sympathy  and  saying I might do as I pleased  for he  had done with me  quitted the room  leaving me to the cruel sensations  of my own heart  which almost burst with anguish  upbraiding me with a  fault which I could not help committing  I immediately hired a    6 22 15  3 45 PM   chariot and six  and would have set out by myself  had not my father s  affection  which all my errors could not efface  provided an attendant   He saw me quite delirious and desperate  and therefore engaged a  relation of my own to accompany and take care of me in this rash  expedition    During this journey  which lasted two days  I felt no remission  of grief and anxiety  but underwent the most intolerable sorrow and  suspense  At last we arrived at a little house called the Hut  on  Salisbury Plain  where  in the most frantic agitation  I wrote a letter  to S    describing the miserable condition to which I was reduced by  his unkindness  and desiring to see him  with the most earnest  solicitations  This billet I committed to the care of my attendant  and  laid strong injunctions upon him to tell Mr  S    my injuries were so  great  and my despair so violent  that  if he did not favour me with a  visit  I would go to him  though at his sister s house  where he then  was    He received my message with great coldness  and told my friend  that   if I would return to London without insisting upon the interview I  demanded  he would  in a little time  follow me to town  and everything  should be amicably adjusted  but when the messenger assured him  that  I was too much transported with grief to hear of such a proposal  he  consented to meet me in the middle of Salisbury Plain  that we might  avoid all observation  And though I was little able to walk  I set  out for the place of assignation  my companion following at a small  distance    When I saw him leading his horse down the hill  I collected all my  fortitude  and advanced to him with all the speed I could exert  but  when I made an effort to speak  my tongue denied its office  and so  lively was the expression of unutterable sorrow in my countenance  that  his heart  hard as it was  melted at the sight of my sufferings  which  he well knew proceeded from the sincerity of my love  At length I  recovered the use of speech enough to tell him  that I was come to take  my leave  and  when I would have proceeded  my voice failed me again   But  after a considerable pause  I found means  with great difficulty   to let him know how sensible I was of my own incapacity to retrieve  his lost affections  but that I was willing  if possible  to retain  his esteem  of which could I be assured  I would endeavour to compose  myself  that I was determined to leave the kingdom  because I could not  bear the sight of those places where we had been so happy in our mutual  love  and that  till my departure  I hoped he would visit me sometimes   that I might  by degrees  wean myself from his company  for I should not
