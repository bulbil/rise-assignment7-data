he lay dreaming of cows   with wings and cooks with horns  and such like wonderful works   of nature  tiU the arrival of his learned friends at noon  As soon   as their arrival was announced  he rose directly  and without wait    ing to visit his cock  to whom he had given a sufficiency of pro    visions before he left him  went to meet them  After several   impatient inquiries into the cause of so sudden and peremptory   a summons  the virtuoso  in all the mysterious importance which   so inestimable an acquisition gave him  produced his own learned   labours of that morning  and when they had sufficiently studied   and examined them  introduced them to a sight of the unparalleled   subject        There  gentlemen    said he  in conscious exultation    there   my friends  behold the most uncommon  unnatural  and inestimable   curiosity that ever enriched the collection of a philosopher  There   behold an indisputable proof of their error  who assert that nature   has placed an immovable boundary between the quadruped and   winged creations  There  behold a sufficient encouragement to   urge your indefatigable search for monsters  and to mix the whole   animal creation in coition  for the production of mermaids  griffins    centaurs  harpies  and homed cooks  and all that beautiful con    fusion which 3 ield such inexpressible delight to an inquisitive    philosophic mind        While he was making this harangue  the company approached   the gilded cage that contained this inestimable prodigy  and stoop    ing down to contemplate him  were surprised to find one of his horns   faUen off  and the other moved considerably from the situation   in which it had been described to them   for doleful to relate  the   cock  which was of the right game breed  had  unfortunately  taken   ofienoe at the visage of the owl his neighbour  and in his struggles   to come at him through the bars of the cage  had rubbed off one   and displaced the other of his horns  When this deplorable mis    fortune was mentioned to the owner  it is impossible to describe   his astonishment and confusion  He stooped hastily to be satisfied   of the truth of it  and beholding the irreparable ruin of his pride    gave one dismal groan  and fell at his length on the floor in a swoon      While his servants  who were summoned upon the occasion  were         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 51     fetching him to himself  one of the philosophers opened the cage    and  taking out the bird  they all entered into a discussion of so   strange a phenomenon  After many learned and ingenious solutions    one of them declared that it had always been his opinion  in which   the present case abundantly confirmed him  that all cornuted   animals cast their horns every year like the stag  and that the present   case was no more than that   of which he was perfectly convinced   as he could plainly feel with his finger the growing horn  which had   thus thrust off the old one     So that  my lord    said he  addressing   himseK to the owner  who by this time was recovered  and attend    ing to their remarks    instead of being vexed at such an event    you have reason to rejoice  as it explains a very difficult point  and   you will now have an opportunity of tracing the growth of this   beautiful prodigy        The sage solution administered some consolation to the virtuoso    who immediately took the bird in his own hands  and feeling the   lump of wax  which had fastened on the fictitious horn  was con    vinced of the truth of his friend s accurate observation  which he   himself further confirmed by taking notice that as no blood followed   the avulsion  it was evident the horn was of itself ready to fall ofi   without the assistance of the cock s struggling  for they had caught   him at that work  as the dislocation of the other horn showed that   that was not in the same state of ripeness  and  therefore  it had   resisted that force  Consciousness of the sagacity of this remark    in some degree  restored his spirits  and he was going to proceed   when one of the company  who had taken up and examined the   fallen horn  and had not given any opinion on the matter  interrupted   him dryly  and said that the hjrpothesis was certainly very in    genious  but he believed the affair might be solved a readier way    for upon examination of the supposed horn
