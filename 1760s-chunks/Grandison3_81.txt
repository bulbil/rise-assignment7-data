them  O Lucy  what a great deal depends upon the answer to this article  as it may happen —But no more suspense  I beseech you  Sir Charles Grandison  No more suspense  I pray you  Dr  Bartlett  My heart sickens at the thought of farther suspense  I cannot bear it     199 Adieu  Lucy  Lengthening my Letter would be only dwelling longer  for I know not how to change my subject  on weaknesses and follies that have already given you too much pain for  Your HARRIET BYRON   LETTER XXII  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   Colnebrooke  Monday  Mar  27   DR  Bartlett  seeing our impatience  asked leave to take the assistance of his nephew in transcribing from Sir Charles s Letters the passages that will enable him to perform the task he had so kindly undertaken  By this means  he has already presented us with the following transcripts  We have eagerly perused them  When you have done so  be pleased to hasten them up  that my cousin Reeves s may have the same opportunity  They are so good as to give chearfully the preference to the venerable circle  as my cousin  who dined with us yesterday  bid me tell you  O my Lucy  what a glorious young man is Sir Charles Grandison  But he had the happiness of a Dr  Bartlett  as he is fond of owning  to improve upon a foundation that was so nobly laid  by the best and wisest of mothers   Dr  Bartlett s first Letter   MY task  my good Miss Byron  will be easy  by the assistance you have allowed me  For what is it  but to transcribe parts of Sir Charles s Letters  adding a few lines here and there  by way of connexion  And I am delighted with it  as it will make known the heart of my beloved patron in all the lights which the most interesting circumstances can throw upon it  to so many worthy persons as are permitted a share in this confidence   The first of your commands runs thus—     200  I should imagine  say you  that the debates Sir Charles mentions  between himself and Signor Jeronymo  and his companions  at their first acquaintance  must be not only curious  but edifying     They are  my good Miss Byron  But as I presume that you Ladies are more intent upon being obeyed in the other articles  See  Lucy  I had better not have dissembled   I will only at present transcribe for you  with some short connexions  two Letters  by which you will see how generously Mr  Grandison sought to recover his friend to the paths of virtue and honour  when he had formed schemes  in conjunction with  and by the instigation of  other gay young men of rank  to draw him in to be a partaker in their guilt  and an abettor of their enterprizes   You will judge from these Letters  madam  without shocking you by the recital  what were the common place pleas of those libertines  despisers of marriage  of the laws of society  and of WOMEN  but as they were subservient to their pleasures   To the Barone della Porretta    WILL my Jeronymo allow his friend  his Grandison  the liberty he is going to take with him  If the friendship he professes for him be such a one  as a great mind can  on reflexion  glory in  he will  And what is this liberty  but such as constitutes the essence of true friendship  Allow me  on this occasion  to say  that your Grandison has seen more of the world than most men  who have lived no longer in it  have had an opportunity to see  I was sent abroad for improvement  under the care of a man who proved to be the most intriguing and profligate of those to whom a youth was ever entrusted  I saw in him  the inconvenience  the odiousness  of libertinism  and  by the assistance of an excellent monitor  with whom   202 I happily became acquainted  and  would it not be false shame  and cowardice  if I did not say  by the Divine assistance  I escaped snares that were laid to corrupt my morals  Hence my dearest friend will the more readily allow me to impart to him some of the lessons that were of so much use to myself   I am the rather encouraged to take this liberty  as I have often flattered myself  that I have seen my Jeronymo affected by the arguments urged in the course of the conversations that have been held in our select meetings at Padua  and at Rome  in which the cause of virtue and true honour has been discussed and pleaded   I have now no hopes of influencing any one of the noble youths  whom  at your request  I have of late so often met  But of you I still have hopes  because you continue to declare  that you prefer my friendship to theirs  You think that I was disgusted at the ridicule with which they generally treated the arguments they could not answer  But  as far as I innocently could  I
