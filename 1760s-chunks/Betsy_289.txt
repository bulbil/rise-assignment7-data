  of my cousin s company  and your wife  it seems  did not think herself   safe with me        These last words  and the contemptuous tone in which they were   expressed  put him into the extremest consternation   I hope  my lord     cried he   that Mrs  Munden cannot have so far forgot herself as to have   acted in any manner unbecoming of the respect due to your   lordship     Fine women will have their caprices   resumed the peer     but no matter  let no more be said of it        Mr  Munden then proceeded to repeat what Mr  W     had said to him  but   his lordship took no notice  and seemed entirely unconcerned all the   time he was speaking  till the other adding  that  if his lordship   thought proper  he would attend him in the morning  in order to be at   hand in case the event should require his presence  the peer replied   peevishly   No  no  you need not come  I believe there will be no   occasion  if there be  I can send for you        After this  Mr  Munden  easily perceiving his company was rather   troublesome than agreeable  made a low obeisance  and withdrew  almost   distracted in his mind at this sudden turn of temper in his patron  and   no less impatient to hear what his wife had to say on that account       It was not in one of the best of humours  as the reader may easily   imagine  that he now came home  nor did he find Mrs  Munden in one very   proper to alleviate his vexation  She was extremely pensive  and when   he asked her  in somewhat of an imperious voice  the reason of having   left Lord      in so abrupt a manner   When you   said she   forsook the   guardianship of my honour  it was time for me to take the defence of it   upon myself  which I could do no other way than by flight         What is it you mean   cried he   I am certain my lord has too much   friendship for me to offer any rudeness to you     Be not too certain     answered she   of the friendship of that base great man   She then began   to repeat the discourse with which his lordship had entertained her    after being left alone with him  but had gone through a very small part   of it before her husband interrupted her  saying  with a kind of   malicious sneer  that he was positive there was nothing at all in what   she apprehended  that it was impossible for the noble lord to be in   earnest when he talked to her in such terms  that she had been deceived   by her own vanity  to mistake for a serious design upon her virtue what   was only meant for mere gallantry  and then added  with more passion    that he feared her idle resentment had lost him all his interest with   the best of friends        Good Heavens   cried she   defend me  and all virtuous women  from such   gallantries  But know  Sir   continued she  with a great deal of   vehemence   that  but for that idle resentment  as you are pleased to   call it  my ruin and your dishonour would have been compleated by this   best of friends         How   said Mr  Munden  eagerly   he did not  sure  proceed to action     Perceiving he was now in a disposition to listen with more attention to   what she said  than hitherto he had done  she hesitated not to acquaint   him with every particular of his lordship s behaviour to her  and the   means by which she had defended herself       During this recital  Mr  Munden bit his lips  and appeared in very great   emotions  He spoke not a word  however  till his fair wife  pitying the   anxieties she saw him under  desired him to think no more of this   accident  since it was so happily got over   It may be so in your   opinion   answered he fiercely   but not in mine  I foresee the   consequences  though you  perhaps  think not of them  It is true  my   lord s behaviour is not to be justified  nor can yours in regard to me   be so  you ought to have considered the dependence I had on him  and not   have carried things with so high an hand
