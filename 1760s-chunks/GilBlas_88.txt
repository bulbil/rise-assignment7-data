the thing genteelly  he called the landlord  and said to him    Master tapster  give us ten bottles of your very best wine  and  as you have an happy knack of doing  make the gentlemen up stairs believe that they have drank them  With all my heart  answered the landlord  but  Master Gaspard  you know that Signor Don Ferdinand owes me for a good many dinners already  If through your kind intervention I could get some little matter on account         Oh  interrupted the valet  do not be at all uneasy about your debt  I will take it upon myself  put it down to me  It is true that some unmannerly creditors have preferred legal measures to a reliance on our honour  but we shall take the first opportunity of obtaining a replevy  and will pay you without looking at your bill  To have my master on your books is like so many ingots of gold  The landlord brought us the wine  in spite of unmannerly creditors  and we drank to a speedy replevy  It was as good as a comedy to see us drinking each other s health every minute  under our masters  titles  Don Antonio s servant called Don Ferdinand s plain Gamboa  and Don Ferdinand s servant called Don Antonio s Centell√©s  they dubbed me Silva  and we kept pace in drunkenness  under these borrowed names  with the noblemen to whom they properly belonged   Though my wit was less conspicuous than that of the other guests  they lost no opportunity of testifying their pleasure in my acquaintance  Silva  said one of our merriest soakers  we shall make something of you  my friend  I perceive that you have wit at will  if you did but know how to draw upon it  The fear of talking absurdly prevents you from throwing out at all  and yet it is only by a bold push that a thousand people now a days set themselves up for good companions  Do you wish to be bright  You have only to give the reins to your loquacity  and to venture indiscriminately on whatever comes uppermost  your blunders will pass for the eccentricities of genius  Though you should utter an hundred extravagances  let but a single good joke be packed up in the bundle  the nonsense shall be all forgotten  the witticism bandied about  and your talent be puffed into high repute  This is the happy method our masters have devised  and it ought to be adopted by all new candidates  Besides that I had but too strong a wish to pass for a clever fellow  the trick they taught me appeared so easy in the performance  that it ought not to be buried in obscurity  I tried it at once  and the fumes of the wine contributed to my success  that is to say  I talked at random  and had the good luck to strike out of much absurdity some flashes of merriment  very acceptable to my audience  This first essay inspired me with confidence  I redoubled my sprightliness  to sparkle in repartee  and chance gave a successful issue to my endeavours   Well done  said my fellow servant who had addressed me in the street  do not you begin to shake off your rustic manners  You have not been two hours in our company  and you are quite another creature  your improvement will be visible every day  This it is to wait on people of quality  It causes an elevation  which the mind can never attain under a plebeian roof  Doubtless  answered I    and for that reason I shall henceforth dedicate my little talents to the nobility  That is bravely said  roared out Don Ferdinand s servant  half seas over  commoners are not entitled to possess such a fund of superior genius as exists in us  Come  gentlemen  let us make a vow never to colleague with any such beggarly fellows  let us swear to that by Styx  We laughed heartily at Gaspard s conceit  the proposal was received with applause  and we took this mock oath with our glasses in our hands   Thus sat we at table till our masters were pleased to get up from it  This was at midnight  an outrageous instance of sobriety  in the opinion of my colleagues  To be sure  these noble lords left the tavern so early only to visit a celebrated wanton  lodging in the purlieus of the court  and keeping open house night and day for the votaries of pleasure  She was a woman from five and thirty to forty  still in the height of her charms  entertaining in her discourse  and so perfect a mistress in the art of pleasure  that she sold the waste and refuse of her beauty at a higher price than the first sample of the unadulterated article  She had always two or three other pieces of damaged goods in the house  who contributed not a little to the great concourse of nobility resorting thither  The afternoon was spent in play  then supper  and the night passed in drinking and making merry  Our masters staid till morning  and so did we  without thinking the time long  for  while they were toying with the mistresses  we attacked the maids  At length  we
