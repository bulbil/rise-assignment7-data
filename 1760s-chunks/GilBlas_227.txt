least temptation to carry my dangerous valour such a length  I had not even the heart to go and bid farewell to Laura  for fear she should insist on me keeping up the farce  I could easily conceive that so excellent an actress might get out of the scrape with flying colours  but there seemed to be nothing for me short of a swingeing castigation  and I was not so far gone in love as to stand by my sweetheart at the risk of my own person  I thought of nothing but a precipitate retreat with my household gods  or rather goods  if such a trumpery collection of individual property might be called so  I disappeared from the playhouse in the twinkling of an eye  and in less time than it would have taken to confess my sins  was my portmanteau carried off and safely lodged with a muleteer who was to set out for Toledo at three o clock next morning  I could have wished myself already with the Count de Polan  whose hospitable roof seemed my only safe asylum  But I was not there yet  and it was impossible to think without dread of the time remaining to be passed in a town where I was afraid they would hunt me out without giving me a night s law   The smell of supper drew me to my inn notwithstanding  though I was as uneasy as a debtor who knows that a writ is out against him  My stomach  I believe  was not sufficiently well knit that evening for my supper to play its part as it should do  The miserable sport of fear  I watched all the people who came into the coffee room  and whenever by chance they carried a gallows in their physiognomy  which is no uncommon ensign in such places of resort  I shuddered with horrid forebodings  After having supped the supper of the damned  I got up from table and returned to my carrier s house  where I threw myself on some clean straw till it was time to set out   My patience was well tried during that interval  for a thousand unpleasant thoughts attacked me in all directions  If I dozed now and then  the enraged marquis stood before me  pounding Laura s fair face to a jelly with his fist  and turning her whole house out at window  or to come nearer home  I heard him giving directions for my death under the operation of a cudgel  At such a vision I started out of my sleep  and waking  which is usually so pleasant after a frightful dream  inspired me with more horror than even the fictions of my entranced fancy   Happily the muleteer delivered me from so dire a purgatory  by coming to acquaint me that his mules were ready  I was immediately on my legs  and set out radically cured  for which heaven has my best thanks  of Laura and the occult sciences  As we got farther from Grenada  my mind recovered its tone  I began chatting with the muleteer  laughed at his droll stories  and insensibly lost all my apprehensions  I slept undisturbed at Ubeda  where we lay the first night  and on the fourth day we got to Toledo  My first care was to inform myself of the Count de Polan s residence  whither I repaired under the full persuasion that he would not suffer me to lodge elsewhere  But I reckoned without my host  There was no one at home but a person to take care of the house  who told me that his master was just gone to the castle of Leyva  having been sent for on account of Seraphina s dangerous illness   The count s absence was altogether unexpected  here was no longer any inducement to stay at Toledo  and all my plans were changed at once  Finding myself so near Madrid  I resolved to go thither  It came into my head that I might make my way at court  where talents of the first order  as I had heard  were not absolutely necessary to fill situations of the first consequence  On the very next morning I took advantage of back carriage  to be set down in the renowned capital of Spain  Fortune took me kindly by the hand  and introduced me to a higher cast of parts than those I had hitherto filled       CH  XII     Gil Blas takes lodgings in a ready furnished house  He gets acquainted with Captain Chinchilla  That officer s character and business at Madrid   ON my first arrival at Madrid  I fixed my head quarters in a lodging house  where resided  among other persons  an old captain  who was come from the distant part of New Castile  to solicit a pension at court  and he thought his claims but too well founded  His name was Don Annibal de Chinchilla  It was not without much staring that I saw him for the first time  He was a man about sixty  of gigantic stature  and of anatomical leanness  His whiskers were like brushwood  fencing off the two sides of his face as high as his temples  Besides that  he was short in his reckoning by an arm and a leg  there was a vacancy for an eye  which Polypheme would have supplied as he did  had patches of green silk been
