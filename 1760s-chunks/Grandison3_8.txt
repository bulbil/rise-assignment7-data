t  pray don t  my dear grandmamma  call it by a severer name  They did not  I am sure they did not  mean to hurt me so much  as I really was hurt  So let it pass  Humour and raillery are very difficult things to rein in  They are ever curveting like a prancing horse  and they will often throw the rider who depends more upon his skill in managing them  than he has reason to do   My uncle was charmed with the scene  and thinks the two ladies did just as he would have done  He means it a compliment to their delicacy  I presume  But I am of my aunt Selby s opinion  that their generous  19 brother would not have given them thanks for their raillery to the poor frighted Harriet  I am very happy  however  that my behaviour and frankness on the occasion are not disapproved at Selby house  and Shirley manor  and by you  my Lucy  And here let that matter rest   Should I not begin to think of going back to you all  my Lucy  I believe I blush ten times a day  when alone  to find myself waiting and waiting as if for the gracious motion  yet apprehending that it never will  never can  be made  and all you  my friends  indulging an absence  that your goodness makes painful to you  in the same hope  It looks—Don t it  Lucy —so like a design upon—I don t know how it looks —But at times  I can t endure myself  And yet while the love of virtue  a little too personal  perhaps  is the foundation of these designs  these waitings  these emotions  I think  I am not wholly inexcusable   I am sure I should not esteem him  were he not the good man he is —Pray  let me ask you—Do you think he could not be put upon saying something affronting to me  upon doing something unworthy of his character —O then I am sure I should hate him  All the other instances of his goodness would then be as nothing  I will be captious  I think  and study to be affronted  whether he intends to affront me  or not —But what a multitude of foolish notions comes into the head of a silly girl  who  little as she knows  knows more of any thing  or of any body  than she knows of herself   I WISH my godfather had not put it in my head  that Emily is cherishing  perhaps unknown to herself  a flame that will devour her peace  For to be sure this young creature can have no hope that—Yet 50 000l  is a vast fortune  But it can never buy her   20 guardian  Do you think such a man as Sir Charles Grandison has a price —I am sure he has not   I watch the countenance  the words  the air of the girl  when he is spoken of  And with pity I see  that he cannot be named  but her eyes sparkle  Her eye is taken off her work or book  as she happens to be engaged in either  and she seems as if she would look the person through who is praising her guardian  For the life of her  she cannot work and hear  And then she sighs—Upon my word  Lucy  there is no such thing as proceeding with his praises before her—the girl so sighs—So young a creature —Yet how can one caution the poor thing   But what makes me a little more observant of her  than I should otherwise perhaps have been  additional to my godfather s observation  is an hint given me by Lady L  which perhaps she has from Miss Grandison  and she not unlikely from the stolen letter  For Miss Grandison hinted at it  but I thought it was only to excite my curiosity  When one is not in good humour  how one s very stile is encumbred    The hint is this  That it is more than probable  it will be actually proposed to me  to take down with me to Northamptonshire this young lady—I  who want a governess myself  to be—But let it be proposed   In a conversation that passed just now  between us women  on the subject of Love  a favourite topic with all girls   this poor thing gave her opinion unasked  and  for a young girl  was quite alert  I thought  She used to be more attentive than talkative   I whispered Miss Grandison once  Don t you think Miss Jervois talks more than she used to do  madam   I think she does  madam  re whispered the arch lady   I beg your pardon—Charlotte  then   You have it  Harriet  then —But let her prate  She is not often in the humour     21 Nay  with all my heart  I love Miss Jervois  But I can t but watch when habits begin to change  And I am always afraid of young creatures exposing themselves when they are between girls and women   I don t love whispering  said Miss Jervois  more pertly than ever  But my guardian loves me  and you  ladies
