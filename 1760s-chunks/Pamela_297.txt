  The poor fellow came in  with so much confusion  that I have never seen   a countenance that expressed so lively a consciousness of his faults    and mingled joy and shame  How do you do  John  said I  I hope you are   very well   The poor fellow could hardly speak  and looked with awe upon   my master  and pleasure upon me  Said my master  Well  John  there is   no room to say any thing to a man that has so much concern already  I   am told you will serve me whether I will or not  but I turn you over   altogether to my spouse here  and she is to do by you as she pleases    You see  John  said I  your good master s indulgence  Well may I   forgive  that have so generous an example  I was always persuaded of   your honest intentions  if you had known how to distinguish between your   duty to your master  and your good will to me  You will now have no more   puzzles on that account  from the goodness of your dear master  I shall   be but too happy I said the poor man  God bless your honour  God bless   you  madam   I now have the joy of my soul  in serving you both  and I   will make the best of servants  to my power  Well  then  John  said I    your wages will go on  as if you had not left your master  May I not say   so  sir  said I  Yes  surely  my dear  replied he  and augment them too    if you find his duty to you deserves it  A thousand millions of thanks    said the poor man  I am very well satisfied  and desire no augmentation    And so he withdrew  overjoyed  and Mrs  Jervis and Mr  Longman were   highly pleased  for though they were incensed against him for his   fault to me  when matters looked badly for me  yet they  and all his   fellow servants  always loved John       When Mr  Longman and Mrs  Jervis had dined  they came in again  to know   if he had any commands  and my dear master  filling a glass of wine    said  Longman  I am going to toast the happiest and honestest couple in   England  my dear Pamela s father and mother   Thank you  dear sir  said   I       I think  continued he  that little Kentish purchase wants a manager  and   as it is a little out of your way  Longman  I have been purposing  if I   thought Mr  Andrews would accept it  that he should enter upon Hodge s   farm that was  and so manage for me that whole little affair  and we   will well stock the farm for him  and make it comfortable  and I think    if he will take that trouble upon him  it will be an ease to you  and a   favour to me       Your honour  said he  cannot do a better thing  and I have had some   inkling given me  that you may  if you please  augment that estate  by   a purchase  of equal amount  contiguous to it  and as you have so much   money to spare  I can t see your honour can do better  Well  said he    let me have the particulars another time  and we will consider about   it  But  my dear  added he  you ll mention this to your father  if you   please       I have too much money  Longman  continued he  lies useless  though  upon   this occasion  I shall not grudge laying out as much in liveries   and other things  as if I had married a lady of a fortune equal  if   possible  to my Pamela s merit  and I reckon you have a good deal in   hand  Yes  sir  said he  more than I wish I had  But I have a mortgage   in view  if you don t buy that Kentish thing  that I believe will answer   very well  and when matters are riper  will mention it to your honour       I took with me  to Lincolnshire  said my master  upwards of six hundred   guineas  and thought to have laid most of them out there   Thank God    thought I  you did not  for he offered me five hundred of them  you   know   but I have not laid out above two hundred and fifty of them  so   two hundred I left there in my escritoire  because I shall go again for
