The girl  brought up by a severe duenna  under the spiritual conduct of Father Alexis  walked in the high road of virtue  but her brother  Gaspard Velasquez  though no pains had been spared to make a good man of him  picked out for himself all the vices of a young profligate  Sometimes he stayed away from home two or three days together  and if  on his return  his father ventured to remonstrate in the least against his proceedings  Gaspard shut his mouth at once  with a haughty toss of the head  and an impertinent answer   Scipio  said the old man one day  my son is the plague of my life  He is over head and ears in all kinds of debauchery  and yet there is no accounting for it  since his education was by no means neglected  I have given him the very best masters  and my friend Father Alexis has done his utmost to train him up in the way he should go  but there was no breaking him in  Master Gaspard ran restive  and bolted into downright libertinism  You may perhaps tell me  that I spared the rod and spoiled the child  Quite otherwise  he was punished whenever the occasion seemed to demand it  for  though good tempered at bottom  I am not to be played upon  I have even gone so far as to lock him up  but that only made hint more headstrong than before  In short  he is one of those impracticable beings  on whom good example  good advice  and a good horsewhip  are equally thrown away  If ever he makes any figure in the world  it must be by a miracle from heaven   Though my heart was not grievously wrung by the sorrows of this unhappy father  sympathy was expected from me  and I condoled with him accordingly  How much to be pitied you are  sir  said I  Virtues like yours deserved to have been handed down in your progeny  The event is quite the reverse  my good lad  answered he  Heaven heard my prayer  and gave me a son  but converted the blessing into an affliction  Among other grounds of complaint against Gaspard  I may tell you in confidence  there is one which gives me a great deal of uneasiness  a vast longing to rob his old father  which he too often finds the means of satisfying  in spite of all my caution  Your predecessor played into his hands  and was turned away in consequence  As for you  I flatter myself that my son will never be able to tamper with your honesty  You will take my side of the question  for doubtless Father Alexis has given you your lesson on that head  You may rest assured of that  said I  for a good long hour did his reverence lecture me on doing your will and pleasure without let or hindrance  but I can assure you  there was no need of his saying anything about the matter  I feel within myself a sort of call to serve you faithfully  and I promise to do it with a zeal beyond all the temptations of the world to shake or lessen   He who only hears one side is in danger of deciding partially  Young Velasquez  a mixture of the fribble and the braggart  concluding from the cut of my countenance that I was made up of mortal frailty like my dear predecessor  drew me aside to a snug corner  and there talked to me after this fashion  Now mind what is said to you  my dear fellow  you may think I do not know that you are set as a spy upon me by my father  but take especial care how you proceed  for I can assure you most sincerely  that the office is not without very considerable inconvenience to those who undertake it  If ever I find that you tell tales out of school  I will give you such a basting as you never had in your life  but if you will make common cause with me  and a fool of my father  you may buy golden returns of gratitude from your humble servant  Do you wish me to deal with you upon the nail  You shall go snacks in at that we can squeeze out of the old fellow  You have only to take your choice  fall at once into the ranks either of father or son  for neutrals will come worse off  where the contending parties fight for their existence   Sir  answered I  you make the shoe pinch very tight  it is self  evident that there is nothing for me to do but to enlist under your banners  though in my conscience it seems like a crying sin to betray Signor Velasquez  That is no concern of yours  rejoined Gaspard  he is an old hunks  who wants to keep me under his thumb  a curmudgeon who refuses me the rights of nature  in refusing to stand to the expenses and repairs of my pleasures  for pleasures are the necessaries of life at five and twenty  It is in this point of view that you must form your opinion of my father  If that is the case  so be it  sir  said I  there is no standing against so just a subject of
