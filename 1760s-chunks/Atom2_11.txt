Yesso was exposed  produced such apprehensions and chagrin in the mind of the Dairo Got hama baba  that his health began to decline  He neglected his food and his rattle  and no longer took any pleasure in kicking the Cuboy  He frequently muttered ejaculations about the farm of Yesso  nay  once or twice in the transports of his impatience  he pulled the bandage from his eyes  and cursed Taycho in the Tartarian language  At length he fell into a lethargy  and even when roused a little by blisters and caustics  seemed insensible of every thing   61 that was done about him  These blisters were raised by burning the moxa upon his scalp  The powder of menoki was also injected in a glyster  and the operation of acupuncture  called Senkei  performed without effect  His disorder was so stubborn  that the Cuboy began to think he was bewitched  and suspected Taycho of having practised sorcery on his sovereign  He communicated this suspicion to Muraclami  who shook his head  and advised that  with the Orator s good leave  the council should be consulted  Taycho  who had gained an absolute empire over the mind of the Dairo  and could not foresee how his interest might stand with his successor  was heartily disposed to concur in any seasible experiment for the recovery of Got hama baba  he therefore consented that the mouths of the council should be unpadlocked   62pro hac vice  and the members were assembled without delay  with this express proviso  however  that they were to confine their deliberations to the subject of the Dairo and his distemper  By this time the physicians had discovered the cause of the disorder  which was no other than his being stung by a poisonous insect produced in the land of Yesso  analogous to the tarantula  which is said to do so much mischief in some parts of Apuglia  as we are told by Aelian  Epiphanius Ferdinandus  and Baglivi  In both cases the only effectual remedy was music  and now the council was called to determine what sort of music should be administered  You must know  Peacock  the Japonese are but indifferently skilled in this art  tho   in general  they affect to be connoisseurs  They are utterly ignorant of the theory  and in the practice are excelled by all their neighbours    63 the Tartars not excepted  For my own part  I studied music under Pythagoras at Crotona  He found the scale of seven tones imperfect  and added the octave as a fixed  sensible  and intelligent termination of an interval  which included every possible division  and determined all the relative differences of sounds  besides  he taught us how to express the octave by ½   c   c  But why should I talk to thee of the antient digramma  the genera   c  of music  which with their colours  were constructed by a division of the diatessaron  Thou art too dull and ignorant to comprehend the chromatic species  the construction of the tetrachord  the Phrygian  the Lydian  and other modes of the antient music  and for distinction of ear  thou mightest be justly ranked among the braying tribe that graze along the ditches of Tottenham court or Hockley i the hole    64 I know that nothing exhilarates thy spirits so much as a sonata on the salt box  or a concert of marrow bones and cleavers  The ears of the Japonese were much of the same texture  and their music was suited to their ears  They neither excelled in the melopoeia  and rythm or cadence  nor did they know any thing of the true science of harmony  compositions in parts  and those combinations of sounds  the invention of which  with the improvement of the scale  is erroneously ascribed to a Benedictine monk  The truth is  the antients understood composition perfectly well  Their scale was founded upon perfect consonances  they were remarkably nice in tempering sounds  and had reduced their intervals and concords to mathematical demonstration   But  to return to the council of Twenty eight  they convened in the   65 same apartment where the Dairo lay  and as the business was to determine what kind of music was most likely to make an impression upon his organs  every member came provided with his expedient  First and foremost  Mr  Orator Taycho pronounced an oration upon the excellences of the land of Yesso  of energy  as the Cuboy said  sufficient to draw the moon from her sphere  it drew nothing  however  from the patient but a single groan  then the Fatzman caused a drum to beat  without producing any effect at all upon the Dairo  tho  it deprived the whole council of their hearing for some time  The third essay was made by Fika kaka  first with a rattle  and then with tongs and gridiron  which last was his favourite music  but here it failed  to his great surprize and consternation  Stiphi rum poo brought the crier of his   66 court to promulgate a decree against Yesso  in a voice that is wont to make the culprit tremble  but the Dairo was found Ignoramus  Nin com poo po blew a blast with a kind of boatswain s whistle  which discomposed the whole audience without affecting the emperor  Fokh—si—rokhu said he
