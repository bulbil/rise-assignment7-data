gushed out  and  endeavouring to get my hand from him  but in   vain  I said  I can expect no better  Your behaviour  sir  to me  has   been just of a piece with these words  Nay  I will say it  though you   were to be ever so angry   I angry  Pamela  No  no  said he  I have   overcome all that  and as you are to go away  I look upon you now as   Mrs  Jervis s guest while you both stay  and not as my servant  and so   you may say what you will  But I ll tell you  Pamela  why you need not   take this matter in such high disdain   You have a very pretty romantic   turn for virtue  and all that   And I don t suppose but you ll hold   it still  and nobody will be able to prevail upon you  But  my child     sneeringly he spoke it   do but consider what a fine opportunity you   will then have for a tale every day to good mother Jervis  and what   subjects for letter writing to your father and mother  and what pretty   preachments you may hold forth to the young gentlemen  Ad s my heart  I   think it would be the best thing you and she could do       You do well  sir  said I  to even your wit to such a poor maiden as me    but  permit me to say  that if you was not rich and great  and I poor   and little  you would not insult me thus   Let me ask you  sir  if you   think this becomes your fine clothes  and a master s station  Why so   serious  my pretty Pamela  said he  Why so grave  And would kiss me  but   my heart was full  and I said  Let me alone  I will tell you  if you was   a king  and insulted me as you have done  that you have forgotten to   act like a gentleman  and I won t stay to be used thus  I will go to the   next farmer s  and there wait for Mrs  Jervis  if she must go  and I d   have you know  sir  that I can stoop to the ordinariest work of your   scullions  for all these nasty soft hands  sooner than bear such   ungentlemanly imputations       I sent for you  said he  in high good humour  but it is impossible to   hold it with such an impertinent  however  I ll keep my temper  But   while I see you here  pray don t put on those dismal grave looks  Why    girl  you should forbear them  if it were but for your pride sake  for   the family will think you are grieving to leave the house  Then  sir    said I  I will try to convince them of the contrary  as well as your   honour  for I will endeavour to be more cheerful while I stay  for that   very reason       Well  replied he  I will set this down by itself  as the first time that   ever what I had advised had any weight with you  And I will add  said   I  as the first advice you have given me of late  that was fit to be   followed   I wish said he   I am almost ashamed to write it  impudent   gentleman as he is   I wish I had thee as quick another way  as thou art   in thy repartees  And he laughed  and I snatched my hand from him  and I   tripped away as fast as I could  Ah  thought I  married  I am sure it is   time you were married  or  at this rate  no honest maiden ought to live   with you       Why  dear father and mother  to be sure he grows quite a rake  How easy   it is to go from bad to worse  when once people give way to vice       How would my poor lady  had she lived  have grieved to see it  but may   be he would have been better then  Though it seems he told Mrs  Jervis    he had an eye upon me in his mother s life time  and he intended to let   me know as much  by the bye  he told her  Here is shamelessness for you    Sure the world must be near at an end  for all the gentlemen about are   as bad as he almost  as far as I can hear   And see the fruits of   such bad examples  There is  Squire Martin in the grove  has
