  although I have taken this step  I will  by all that s good and   holy  use you honourably  Suffer not your fears to transport you to   a behaviour that will be disreputable to us both  for the place where   you ll receive this  is a farm that belongs to me  and the people civil    honest  and obliging        You will  by this time  be far on your way to the place I have allotted   for your abode for a few weeks  till I have managed some affairs  that   will make me shew myself to you in a much different light  than you may   possibly apprehend from this rash action  And to convince you  that I   mean no harm  I do assure you  that the house you are going to  shall be   so much at your command  that even I myself will not approach it without   leave from you  So make yourself easy  be discreet and prudent  and a   happier turn shall reward these your troubles  than you may at present   apprehend        Meantime I pity the fatigue you will have  if this come to your hand in   the place I have directed  and will write to your father to satisfy him    that nothing but what is honourable shall be offered to you  by                     Your passionate admirer   so I must style myself                                                                                    Don t think hardly of poor Robin  You have so possessed all my servants   in your favour  that I find they had rather serve you than me  and  tis   reluctantly the poor fellow undertook this task  and I was forced to   submit to assure him of my honourable intentions to you  which I   am fully resolved to make good  if you compel me not to a contrary   conduct           I but too well apprehended that the letter was only to pacify me for the   present  but as my danger was not so immediate as I had reason to dread    and he had promised to forbear coming to me  and to write to you  my   dear parents  to quiet your concern  I was a little more easy than   before and I made shift to eat a little bit of boiled chicken they had   got for me  and drank a glass of my sack  and made each of them do so   too       But after I had so done  I was again a little flustered  for in came   the coachman with the look of a hangman  I thought  and madamed me up   strangely  telling me  he would beg me to get ready to pursue my journey   by five in the morning  or else he should be late in  I was quite   grieved at this  for I began not to dislike my company  considering how   things stood  and was in hopes to get a party among them  and so to put   myself into any worthy protection in the neighbourhood  rather than go   forward       When he withdrew  I began to tamper with the farmer and his wife  But    alas  they had had a letter delivered them at the same time I had  so   securely had Lucifer put it into his head to do his work  and they only   shook their heads  and seemed to pity me  and so I was forced to give   over that hope       However  the good farmer shewed me his letter  which I copied as   follows  for it discovers the deep arts of this wicked master  and how   resolved he seems to be on my ruin  by the pains he took to deprive me   of all hopes of freeing myself from his power           FARMER NORTON        I send to your house  for one night only  a young gentlewoman  much   against her will  who has deeply embarked in a love affair  which   will be her ruin  as well as the person s to whom she wants to betroth   herself  I have  to oblige her father  ordered her to be carried to one   of my houses  where she will be well used  to try  if by absence  and   expostulation with both
