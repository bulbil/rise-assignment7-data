 and cry d    O  Mr  Melmoth  this barbarous brother will break my heart  he has planted daggers here  putting her hand upon her bosom —but you know the whole affair I suppose  as I am   125 sensible that  of all his friends  you possess the highest place in his confidence     I bowed  and was silent    What think you  Sir   says she   of this new exploit  Can you say any thing to defend him now  Would to God that you could  Yet  O  Mr  Melmoth  an attempt to extenuate his guilt would no less disgrace your good sense  than injure your humanity  But tell me  Sir  has he sent you an account of particulars  has he made you acquainted with every thing     I again bowed  and was silent    And well  Mr  Melmoth   says she    what can we do to save his life  to save the honour of the dear unhappy   126 girl  and to restore the peace of a worthy  innocent family     I replied  that you were still at Reading  and would remain there for a day or two  that I was convinced nobody had so great an influence over you as her ladyship  and advised her to exert that influence in such a manner as she should judge most conducive to those salutary purposes    Ay  but  Sir   interrupted lady Haversham    do you know that poor Miss Mildmay is turned out of doors  that she is now a wanderer  an outcast from her father s house  and that her disgrace must inevitably become public before any letter or message can possibly reach him  Her unhappy mother sends me a bleeding account of particulars  I suppose  after your cruel friend had quitted the house    127 Miss Mildmay  between her consciousness on account of the past  and her despair on account of the future  revealed the whole matter to the venerable lady  Here  Mr  Melmoth  we keep no secrets from you  here is Mrs  Mildmay s letter  and  if you can read it with dry eyes  you have either more philosophy or less feeling than I could wish any person  whom I really regard  to possess     I took the letter  and shall not scruple to acknowledge that I cried very heartily at several of the passages  The elevation of sentiment  which the young lady shews in never once attempting to upbraid you  though she had such an undoubted occasion for reproach  gives me a very favourable idea of her character  and the generosity of her self accusation  is such an argument in support of her candour  as must  I think  entirely remove those unmanly apprehensions   128 upon which you grounded your rejection   Though I am by many years the oldest man  you know the sex infinitely better than I  and know also better than I what is essential to the promotion of your own happiness  yet  in the present case  my dear Harold  I think you excessively in fault  Through the whole of Miss Mildmay s behaviour  there has been much tenderness  but no levity  and her error was an excess of love  not a vehemence of constitution  had it been the latter  like the generality of women  she would have kept her secret to herself  or meanly crouched under your indignities  in such a manner as had prevented the likelihood of a separation  but still alive to the sharpest nicety of sentiment  she neither could stoop to put up with an insult to retain you  nor  when a separation took place  attempt   129 to conceal  by any duplicity of conduct  the fatal occasion of her loss  In whatsoever light I view her conduct  I see a woman of exalted principle  though I find that woman unhappily in love  and in love with a fellow too  who  instead of making any allowances on account of her passion  makes use of that very passion as an argument for involving her in equal distress and disgrace   I have here  at lady Haversham s request  enclosed Mrs  Mildmay s letter  as your sister is  in consequence of this unhappy affair  so very much indisposed  that she doubts her own ability to write to day  she has charged me  however  in her name  to tell you  that  with all her tenderness for you  if you give up Miss Mildmay  you must give up her also  she considers herself as a partner in the injury  which that unfortunate   130 young lady has sustained  and is  besides apprehensive of those consequences which naturally result from the dishonour of a considerable family—You understand me—Colonel Mildmay and you  must inevitably have a meeting  and though I know you as successful in in your weapons  and am sensible you have as much courage  as any man in England  it must nevertheless be a disagreeable circumstance to a man of your sensibility  to expose Mr  Mildmay s house to fresh misfortunes  when the injury which you have already done it  exceeds the power of reparation
