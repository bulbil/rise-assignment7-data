had so justly conceived against her  without seeming to do so  gave   her a most exquisite satisfaction                CHAPTER VII       Is the better for being short          Miss Flora retired to her chamber  indeed  not to employ herself in the   manner she pretended  but to give a loose to passions more inordinate   and outrageous than it would naturally be believed could have taken   possession of so young a heart       But it is now high time to let the reader see into the secret springs   which set her wicked wit in motion  and induced her to act in the manner   she had done       Through the whole course of the preceding pages  many hints have been   given  that the inclinations of this young lady were far from being   unblameable  and it will not seem strange  that a person of the   disposition she has all along testified  should envy and malign those   charms she every day saw so much extolled  and preferred above her own    but we do not ordinarily find one  who  all gay and free like her  and   who various times  and for various objects  had experienced those   emotions which we call love  should all at once be inspired with a   passion no less serious than it was violent  for a person who never made   the least addresses to her on that account       Yet so in effect it was  Mr  Trueworth had been but a very few times in   her company  before she began to entertain desires for the lover of her   fair friend  Whenever she had an opportunity of speaking to him alone    she made him many advances  which he either did not  or would not    interpret in the sense she meant them  This coldness  instead of   abating  did but the more inflame her wishes  and  looking on the   passion he had for Miss Betsy  as the only impediment to the   gratification of her inclinations  she cursed his constancy  and the   beauties which excited it  So true is that observation of Mr  Dryden             Love various minds does variously inspire        He stirs in gentle natures gentle fire        Like that of incense on the altar laid        But raging flames tempestuous souls invade        A fire which every windy passion blows        With pride it mounts  and with revenge it glows        Miss Flora was not of a temper  either to bear the pangs of hopeless   love in silent grief  or to give way too readily to despair  In spite of   the indifference she found herself treated with by Mr  Trueworth  she   was not without hope  that if she could by any means occasion a disunion   between him and Miss Betsy  he would then be brought to cast his eyes on   her  and return her flame with some degree of ardency       It was for this end she had taken so much pains in endeavouring to   persuade Miss Betsy either to write  or suffer her to go  to Mr  Staple    in order  as she pretended  to undeceive that gentleman in his opinion    that she was in love with Mr  Trueworth  but her intentions  in reality    were to make him believe that he himself was the favoured person  and   had much the advantage over his rival in the affections of his mistress    This she doubted not  would make him quit his resolution of going into   the country  and encourage him to renew his courtship with the same   fervency as ever  The pride she knew Miss Betsy took in a multiplicity   of lovers  and the equality with which she had carried herself between   him and Mr  Trueworth  and which probably she would continue  seemed to   afford her a fair prospect of giving Mr  Trueworth so much cause of   discontent  as to make him break off with a woman who  after what had   passed  made no distinction between him and the person he had twice   vanquished in the field  She knew it would  at least  create a great   deal of perplexity among them  and delay  if not totally prevent  the   completion of what she so much dreaded       But this scheme being rendered abortive  by the seasonable discovery   Miss Betsy had made of her perfidiousness  she set her wits to work for   some other new invention  and  believing that Miss Betsy s pride would   immediately take fire on the least suspicion of any insult
