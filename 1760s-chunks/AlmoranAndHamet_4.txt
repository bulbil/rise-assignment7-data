says he   make the   most of the power that is now put into my hand  and wait till some   favourable opportunity shall offer to increase it  Let me dissemble my   jealousy and disappointment  that I may not alarm suspicion  or put the   virtues of HAMET upon their guard against me  and let me contrive to   give our joint administration such a form  as may best favour my   design        Such were the reflections  with which ALMORAN soothed the anguish of his   mind  while HAMET was busied in speculations of a very different kind    If he was pleased at reflecting  that he was raised from a subject to a   prince  he was pleased still more  when he considered his elevation as a   test of his father s affection to his person  and approbation of his   conduct  he was also delighted with the thought  that his brother was   associated with him in the arduous talk which he was now called to   perform   If I had been appointed to govern alone   said he   I should   have had no equal  and he who has no equal  though he may have faithful   servants  can have no friend  there cannot be that union of interests    that equal participation of good  that unrestrained intercourse of mind    and that mutual dependence  which constitutes the pure and exalted   happiness of friendship  With ALMORAN  I shall share the supreme delight   of wresting the innocent and the helpless from the iron hand of   oppression  of animating merit by reward  and restraining the unworthy   by fear  I shall share  with ALMORAN  the pleasures of governing a   numerous  a powerful  and a happy people  pleasures which  however   great  are  like all others  increased by participation        While HAMET was thus enjoying the happiness  which his virtue derived   from the same source  from which the vices of ALMORAN had filled his   breast with anguish and discontent  OMAR was contriving in what manner   their joint government could best be carried into execution       He knew that Solyman  having considered the dispositions of his sons    was of opinion  that if they had been blended in one person  they would   have produced a character more fit to govern in his stead  than either   of them alone  ALMORAN  he thought  was too volatile and warm  but he   suspected  that HAMET would sink into inactivity for want of spirit  he   feared alike ALMORAN S love of enterprize  and HAMET S fondness for   retirement  he observed  in HAMET  a placid easiness of temper  which   might suffer the reins of government to lie too loose  and  in ALMORAN    a quickness of resentment  and jealousy of command  which might hold   them too tight  he hoped  therefore  that by leaving them a joint   dominion  he should blend their dispositions  at least in their effects    in every act of government that should take place  or that  however they   should agree to administer their government  the public would derive   benefit from the virtues of both  without danger of suffering from their   imperfections  as their imperfections would only operate against each   other  while  in whatever was right  their minds would naturally concur    as the coincidence of rectitude with rectitude is necessary and eternal    But he did not consider  that different dispositions operating   separately upon two different wills  would appear in effects very unlike   those  which they would concur to produce in one  that two wills  under   the direction of dispositions so different  would seldom be brought to   coincide  and that more mischiefs would probably arise from the contest    than from the imperfections of either alone       But Solyman had so long applauded himself for his project before he   revealed it to OMAR  that OMAR found him too much displeased with any   objection  to consider its weight  and knowing that peculiar notions are   more rarely given up  than opinions received from others  and made our   own only by adoption  he at length acquiesced  lest he should by farther   opposition lose his influence  which on other occasions he might still   employ to the advantage of the public  and took a solemn oath  that he   would  as far as was in his power  see the will carried into execution       To this  indeed  he consented without much reluctance  as he had little   less reason to fear the sole government of ALMORAN  than a joint   administration  and if a struggle for superiority should happen  he   hoped the virtues HAMET would obtain the suffrages of the people in his   favour  and establish him upon
