order to eat by themselves —As they retired together  I perceived that Miss had got more twists from nature  than I had before observed  being bent sideways into the figure of an S  so that her progression very much resembled that of a crab —The prude also chose the captain for her mess mate  and ordered breakfast for two only to be brought into another separate room  while the lawyer and I  deserted by the rest of the company  were fain to put up with one another  I was a good deal chagrined at the stately reserve of Mrs  Snapper  who I thought did not use me with all the complaisance I deserved  and my companion declared  that he had been a traveller these twenty years  and never knew the stage coach rules so much infringed before  As for the honourable gentlewoman  I could not conceive the meaning of her attachment to the lieutenant  and asked the lawyer if he knew for which of the soldier s virtues she admired him  The counsellor facetiously replied     I suppose the lady knows him to be an able conveyancer  and wants him to make a settlement intail  —  I could not help laughing at the archness of the   199 barrister  who entertained me during breakfast  with a great deal of wit of the same kind  at the expence of our fellow travellers  and among other things said  he was sorry to find the young lady saddled with such incumbrances     When we had made an end of our repast  and paid our reckoning  we went into the coach  took our places  and bribed the driver with six pence  to revenge us on the rest of his fare  by hurrying them away in the midst of their meal —This he performed to our satisfaction  after he had disturbed their enjoyment with his importunate clamour —The mother and daughter obeyed the summons first  and coming to the coach door  were obliged to desire the coachman s assistance to get in  because the lawyer and I had agreed to shew our resentment by our neglect —They were no sooner seated  than the captain appeared as much heated as if he had been pursued a dozen of miles by an enemy  and immediately after him came the lady  not without some marks of disorder —Having helped her up  he entered himself  growling a few oaths against the coachman for his impertment interruption  and the lawyer comforted him  by saying  that if he had suffered a nisi prius through the obstinacy of the defendant  he would have an opportunity to join issue at the next stage  This last expression gave offence to the grave gentlewoman  who told him  if she was a man  she would make him repent of such obscenity  and thanked God she had never been in such company before —At this insinuation  the captain thought himself under a necessity of espousing the lady s cause  and accordingly threatned to cut the lawyer s ears out of his head  if he should give his tongue any such   200 liberties for the future —The poor counsellor begged pardon  and universal silence ensued   CHAP  LV    I resolve to ingratiate myself with the mother  and am favoured by accident—the precise lady finds her husband  and quits the coach—the captain is disappointed of his dinner—we arrive at Bath—I accompany Miss Snapper to the long room  where she is attacked by beau N—h  and turns the laugh against him—I make love to her  and receive a check—I squire her to an assembly  where I am blest with a sight of my dear Narcissa  which discomposes me so much  that Miss Snapper observing my disorder  is at pains to discover the cause—is picqued at the occasion  and in our way home  pays me a sarcastic compliment—I am met by Miss Williams  who is maid and confidante of Narcissa—she acquaints me with her lady s regard for me while under the disguise of a servant  and describes the transports of Narcissa on seeing me at the assembly  in the character of a gentleman—I am surprized with an account of her aunt s marriage  and make an appointment to meet Miss Williams next day   DURING this unsocial interval  my pride and interest maintained a severe conflict    201 on the subject of Miss Snapper  whom the one represented as unworthy of my notice  and the other proposed as the object of my whole attention  The advantages and disadvantages attending such a match  were opposed to one another by my imagination  and at length  my judgment gave it so much in favour of the first  that I resolved to prosecute my scheme  with all the address in my power —I thought I perceived some concern in her countenance  occasioned by my silence  which she no doubt imputed to my disgust at her mother s behaviour  and as I believed the old woman could not fail of ascribing my muteness to the same motive  I determined to continue that sullen conduct towards her  and fall upon some other method of manifesting my esteem for the daughter  nor was it difficult for me to make her acquainted with my sentiments by the expression of my looks  which I modelled into the characters of humility and love  and which were answered by her with all the sympathy and approbation I could desire  But
