 and with more than my offered hand  at the moment of his departure  I thought I read in his eyes a concern  for the first time  that called for a pity which I imagined I myself wanted not  Yet I had a pang at parting—When the door shut out the agreeable man  never again  thought I  to be opened to give him entrance  I sighed at the reflexion  But who perceived it —I never could be insensible in a parting scene  with less agreeable friends  It was the easier for me to attribute to the gentleness of my heart  the instant sensibility  My father clasped me to his bosom  My mother embraced me  without mortifying me by saying for what  My brother  the bishop  called me twenty fond names  all my friends complimented me  but only on my chearfulness  and said  I was once more their own Clementina  I went to rest  pleased that I had so happily acquitted myself  and that possibly I contributed to the repose of dear friends  whose repose I had been the cause of disturbing   But  alas  this conduct was too great for the poor Clementina to maintain  My soul was too high set —You know the rest  and I am lost to the joys of this life  For I never  never  will be the wife of a man  if I might  who by his religion is an enemy to the faith I never wavered in  nor would ever change  were an earthly crown on the head of the man I love to be the reward  and a painful death  in the prime of my life  the contrary   A flood of tears prevented farther speech  She hid her face in my bosom  She sighed—Dear Lady  How she sighed     251 This  madam  is the account I have to give of what has passed between your beloved Clementina and me  Never was there a more noble struggle between duty and affection  tho  her heart was too tender  and  in short  the man s merits too dazling  to allow it to be effectual  She is unwilling that I should send you the particulars  She shall be ashamed  she says  to look her father  her mother  in the face  and she dreads still more  if possible  her confessor s being made acquainted with the state of her heart  and the cause of her disorder  But I tell her  it is absolutely necessary for her mother to know everything that I know  in order to attempt a cure   This cure  madam  I am afraid will never be effected  but by giving her in marriage to the happy man  I must think him so  who will be intitled  by general consent  to so great a blessing   You  madam  will act in this affair as you judge proper  But if you can at Bologna  at Urbino  and Naples  get over your family objections  you will perhaps find yourselves obliged  such are the young Lady s own scruples  on the score of religion  to take pains to persuade her to pursue her inclination  and accept Mr  Grandison for an husband   Be this as it may  I would humbly recommend a gentle and soothing treatment of her  She never knew yet what the contrary was  and were she to experience that contrary now upon an occasion so very delicate  and in which her Judgment and her Love are  as she hints  at variance  I verily think  she would not be able to bear it—That God direct you for the best  whom you and yours have always served with signal devotion   I will only add  That since the secret which had so long preyed upon her fine spirits  is revealed  she appears to be much more easy than before  but yet she dreads the reception she shall meet with on her return to Bologna  She begs of me  when that return   252 shall be ordered  to accompany her  in order to enable her  as she says  to support her spirits  She is very desirous to enter into a nunnery  She says  She never can be the wife of any other man  and she thinks she ought not to be his  on whom her heart is fixed   A word of comfort on paper  from your honoured hand  I know  madam  would do a great deal towards healing her wounded heart   I am  madam  with the greatest veneration and respect   Your Ladyship s Most faithful humble servant  HORTENSIA BEAUMONT   LET me add  my good Miss Byron  that the Marchioness sent an answer to this Letter expressing the highest obligation and gratitude to Mrs  Beaumont  and inclosed a Letter to her daughter  filled with tender and truly motherly consolation  inviting her back to Bologna out of hand  and her amiable friend with her  Promising  in the name of her father and brothers  a most indulgent welcome  and assuring her  that every thing should be done that could be done  to make her happy in her own way   LETTER XXV  Miss BYRON  To Miss SELBY    Wedn  Night
