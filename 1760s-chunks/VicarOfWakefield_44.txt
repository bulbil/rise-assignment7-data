own cloaths  and then I was admitted to his table upon the footing of half friend  half underling  My business was to attend him at auctions  to put him in spirits when he sate for his picture  to take the left hand in his chariot when not filled by another  and to assist at tattering a kip  as the phrase was  when we had a mind for a frolic  Beside this  I had twenty other little employments in the family  I was to do many small things without bidding  to carry the cork screw  to stand godfather  Page  13  to all the butler s children  to sing when I was bid  to be never out of humour  always to be humble  and  if I could  to be happy    In this honourable post  however  I was not without a rival  A captain of marines  who seemed formed for the place by nature  opposed me in my patron s affections  His mother had been laundress to a man of quality  and thus he early acquired a taste for pimping and pedigree  As this gentleman made it the study of his life to be acquainted with lords  though he was dismissed from several for his stupidity  yet he found many of them who permitted his assiduities  being as dull as himself  As flattery was his trade  he practised it with the easiest address imaginable  but it came aukward and stiff from me  and as every day my patron s desire of flattery encreased  so every hour being better acquainted with his defects  I became more unwilling to give  Page  14  it  Thus I was once more fairly going to give up the field to the captain  when my friend found occasion for my assistance  This was nothing less than to fight a duel for him  with a gentleman whose sister it was pretended he had used ill  I readily complied with his request  and tho  I see you are displeased at my conduct  yet as it was a debt indispensably due to friendship  I could not refuse  I undertook the affair  disarmed my antagonist  and soon after had the pleasure of finding that the lady was only a woman of the town  and the fellow her bully and a sharper  This piece of service was repaid with the warmest professions of gratitude  but as my friend was to leave town in a few days  he knew no other method to serve me  but by recommending me to his uncle Sir William Thornhill  and another nobleman of great distinction  who enjoyed a post under the government  When he was gone  my first care was to carry his recommendatory  Page  15  letter to his uncle  a man whose character for every virtue was universal  yet just  I was received by his servants with the most hospitable smiles  for the looks of the domestics ever transmit their master s benevolence  Being shewn into a grand apartment  where Sir William soon came to me  I delivered my message and letter  which he read  and after pausing some minutes  Pray  Sir  cried he  inform me what you have done for my kinsman  to deserve this warm recommendation  But I suppose  Sir  I guess at your merits  you have fought for him  and so you would expect a reward from me  for being the instrument of his vices  I wish  sincerely wish  that my present refusal may be some punishment for your guilt  but still more  that it may be some inducement to your repentance —The severity of this rebuke I bore patiently  because I knew it was just  My whole expectations now  therefore  lay in my letter to the great man   Page  16  As the doors of the nobility are almost ever beset with beggars  all ready to thrust in some sly petition  I found it no easy matter to gain admittance  However  after bribing the servants with half my worldly fortune  I was at last shewn into a spacious apartment  my letter being previously sent up for his lordship s inspection  During this anxious interval I had full time to look round me  Every thing was grand  and of happy contrivance  the paintings  the furniture  the gildings  petrified me with awe  and raised my idea of the owner  Ah  thought I to myself  how very great must the possessor of all these things be  who carries in his head the business of the state  and whose house displays half the wealth of a kingdom  sure his genius must be unfathomable  During these awful reflections I heard a step come heavily forward  Ah  this is the great man himself  No  it was only a chambermaid  Another foot was heard soon after  This  Page  17  must be He  No  it was only the great man s valet de chambre  At last his lordship actually made his appearance  Are you  cried he  the bearer of this here letter  I answered with a bow  I learn by this  continued he  as how that—But just at that instant a servant delivered him a card  and without taking farther notice  he went out of the room  and left
