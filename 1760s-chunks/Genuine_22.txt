the admiralty  so irritated those on whom his greatest interest was founded  that they procured his dismission  and he was reduced to half pay   He had also the mortification to perceive  upon examining into the state of his affairs  that he was indebted much more than he had any reasonable view of paying  so that he was obliged to apply to a relation to assist him with his service and interest in obtaining the protection of the board of green cloth   A separation was now deemed absolutely necessary  and accordingly Miss ELLIOT set out for London  where being arrived  she took genteel lodgings near Cavendish square  and lived in great splendor  till the D— of C— returned to England  which happened in about a month after her last adventure     105Her illustrious lover  whom an absence of three months had not in the least altered in respect of fondness  gave her such convincing proofs that his love for her was rather increased than diminished  and accordingly he constantly administered with greater prodigality to her extravagance than he had ever done before  He was however soon tired of this profuse way of bestowing his favours  and he at last resolved to abandon her entirely on that account  which he did by giving her to understand  that the last favour she was to expect from him  was what was enclosed in the billet he sent her  namely  a five hundred pounds bank note   Being thus abandoned  the first lover that presented himself at the shrine of her beauty  was the count de Guerchy  This gentleman  by birth a Frenchman  was the more agreeable to Miss ELLIOT  as his complaisance flattered her pride  and the great encomiums he passed on her beauty  He made a long introduction to her on the subject of her wealth  and having harrangued a long while on that subject  he assured her  he had no other intention    106 than to make her eternally happy  and even went so far as to offer marriage  provided she was willing to accept of him as a husband  This she absolutely refused  but suffered him to court her as close and assiduously as if he had been wooing her to matrimony  he made several valuable presents  which she suffered herself to be prevailed on to accept  though not without great difficulty   Gradually she suffered all his other importunities  and when he made a proposal of a compliment or appointment to her for a settlement  he said  there was not less due from him  to acknowledge the favours he received  than if our heroine had been in the greatest necessity  He added  he would make her life perfectly easy  by doing every thing in his power to please her  and immediately signed a paper which intitled her to 500l  a year   Thus they lived happy in the enjoyment of each other about nine months  during which time Miss ELLIOT had several other private intrigues  particularly  〈◊〉 captain R—rts  who was doatingly   107 fond of her  and made her many valuable presents  This intercourse with the captain drew on her the resentment of a young lady  much remarked for her beauty and other female accomplishments  and had well nigh produced an open rupture between her and the French count  who  excepting a small tincture of jealousy in his temper  was the most affable good natured man in the world  As we shall have occasion to say something about the lady kept by captain R—rts  it will be proper to give the following sketch of her life   She derived her extraction from parents in the most eligible situation in life  being happily exempt from those perplexing difficulties  which attend redundant wealth on the one hand  and those corroding cares that accompany meagre want on the other  Her father enjoyed an estate of about five hundred pounds a year in the west riding of Yorkshire  where he lived happy in himself and spouse  beloved by his friends  and respected by all within the circle of his acquaintance     108She had received a good education from her parents  and at the age of fourteen years began to feel more sensibly those longings for pleasure of the animal kind  which principally influenced her future conduct  Her first amour was carried on in the following manner   A young getleman  who was distantly related to her mother  happening to call as he passed by their house  was pressed by her father to stay with them a few weeks  To many personal charms  were added a deportment peculiarly easy and polite  and something uncommonly sweet and insinuating in his address  therefore it is no wonder that a girl  so susceptible of love as the young lady was  could not see him with an indifferent eye  Every word and gesture of his gave her great pleasure  but when he addressed his conversation to her  she felt an inward transport not easily to be described   It soon appeared that her lover thought he had made a conq•est of her  for in a short time she received a letter from him filled with expressions of love  This gave   109 her such extreme pleasure  that in her answer  she gave him the strongest proofs that she approved of his passion  After these mutual declarations  she had soon the happiness of
