where they found him in an easy   chair  leaning on a table  with papers and a standish before him  They   perceived he had been writing  for the pen was not out of his hand when   they entered the room  he threw it down  however  as soon as he saw   them  and rose to receive them with a great deal of politeness  though   accompanied with an air  which  in spite of his endeavours to conceal   it  discovered he laboured under an extraordinary dejection of spirits        I am glad   said Mr  Chatfree  pointing to the pen   to see you are   able to make use of that weapon  as I feared your arm had been too much   prejudiced by another     I have found some difficulty  indeed  in doing   it   replied the wounded gentleman   but something  which seemed to me a   case of necessity  obliged me to exert my utmost efforts for that   purpose        After the first civilities were over  and they were all seated  Mr    Goodman and Mr  Chatfree began to open the business upon which they   came  Mr  Goodman represented to him  in the most pathetick terms  the   deep concern he had been in  for having ever encouraged his addresses to   Miss Betsy  and excused himself for having done so  by his ignorance  at   the time  that Mr  Trueworth had been previously recommended by her   brother  He then gave him some hints  that the civilities Miss Betsy had   treated him with  he feared  were rather owing to that little vanity   which is generally the companion of youth and beauty  than to that real   regard which his passion and person merited from her  and said  he   heartily wished to see him withdraw his affections from an object  where   he could not now flatter him with the least hope of a suitable return        No  no   cried Mr  Chatfree  interrupting him hastily   you may take my   word  she is as much in love as a girl of her temper can be with Mr    Trueworth  and I do not doubt but you will all see the effects of it as   soon as her brother comes to town   Mr  Goodman  on this  took an   opportunity of telling Mr  Staple  that the ascendant that young   gentleman had over his sister  and the zeal he expressed for the   interest of his friend  would certainly go a great way in determining   the point  and added  that if it were true  as his friends suggested    that she really had an inclination for Mr  Trueworth  she would then   avow it  and make a merit of it to her brother  as if done merely in   regard to him       Many other arguments were urged by these two gentlemen  in order to   convince Mr  Staple of the little probability there was in succeeding   with Miss Betsy  all which he listened to attentively  never   interrupting what either of them said  till  perceiving they had ended   all they had to offer on the subject  he made them this reply        Gentlemen   said he   I am infinitely obliged to you both for this   visit  and the friendly purpose of it  which  I perceive  was to give me   that advice which you might reasonably think I wanted  I have heard  and   I believe have not lost one word  at least  I am sure  no part of the   meaning  of what you have delivered  I own there is a great justice in   every thing you have alledged  and am pleased to think the arguments you   bring  are such as  before your coming here  I had myself brought   against the folly of my own unhappy passion for Miss Betsy  But    gentlemen  it is not that I am capable of being deterred from   prosecuting it  by any thing I might have to apprehend  either by her   own inclinations or her brother s persuasions  but for other reasons    which at present  perhaps  you may be ignorant of  yet are such as to   conceal I should but half be just  Be pleased  Sir   he continued    addressing himself to Mr  Goodman  and giving him a paper   to read that   letter  and see what my resolutions are  and the motives I have for   them        Mr  Goodman was beginning to look over the paper  but Mr  Staple   requested he would read it aloud  as he desired that Mr  Chatfree should   be partaker of the contents  on which he
