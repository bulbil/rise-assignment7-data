  Ah  sister   replied he   do not let your vanity deceive you on this   score  I see very plainly that Mr  Trueworth regards you with too much   indifference to retain resentment for any treatment you have given him    that he once loved you  I am well assured  that he no longer does so  is   owing to yourself  but I shall mention him no more  the passion he had   for you is extinguished  I believe  beyond all possibility of reviving    nor would I wish you to attempt it  I would only have you remember what   Mr  Goodman uttered concerning you with almost his dying breath  for my   own part  I have not been a witness of your conduct  since the unhappy   brul√©e I fell into on your account at Oxford  which I then hoped would   be a sufficient warning for your future behaviour        If Miss Betsy had been less innocent  it is probable she would have   replied in a more satisfactory manner to her brother s reproaches  but   the real disdain she always had for whatever had the least tendency to   dishonour  made her zealous in defending herself only in things of which   she was not accused  and silent in regard of those in which she was   judged blame worthy        What avails your being virtuous   said Mr  Francis   I hope  and   believe  you are so  but your reputation is of more consequence to your   family  the loss of the one might be concealed  but a blemish on the   other brings certain infamy and disgrace on yourself and all belonging   to you        On this she assumed the courage to tell him his way of reasoning was   neither just nor delicate   Would you   said she   be guilty of a base   action  rather than have it suspected that you were so     No   answered   he   but virtue is a different thing in our sex to what it is in yours    the forfeiture of what is called virtue in a woman is more a folly than   a baseness  but the virtue of a man is his courage  his constancy  his   probity  which if he loses  he becomes contemptible to himself  as well   as to the world         And certainly   rejoined Miss Betsy  with some warmth   the loss of   innocence must render a woman contemptible to herself  though she should   happen to hide her transgression from the world     That may be   said   Mr  Francis   but then her kindred suffer not through her fault  the   remorse  and the vexation for what she has done  is all her own  Indeed    sister   continued he   a woman brings less dishonour upon a family by   twenty private sins  than by one publick indiscretion         Well   answered she   I hope I shall always take care to avoid both the   one and the other  for my own sake  As to indulging myself with the   innocent pleasures of the town  I have the example of some ladies of the   first quality  and best reputation  to justify me in it        Mr  Thoughtless was about to make some reply  which  perhaps  would have   been pretty keen  but was prevented by the coming in of her maid  who   delivering a letter to her  and saying   From Sir Frederick Fineer    Madam   she hastily broke it open  and having read it  bid the maid let   Sir Frederick s servant know she would be at home        There  brother   said she  giving him the letter   read that  and be   convinced I have not lost every good offer in losing Mr  Trueworth     I   wish you have not   answered he sullenly  He took the paper  however    and read the contents of it  which were these             To the divine arbitress of my fate  the omnipotently lovely        Miss Betsy Thoughtless            O Goddess  more cruel than the avenging Nemisis  what have I done         that  like Ixion  I must still be tortured on the wheel of        everlasting hopes and fears  I hoped yesterday to have approached        the shrine of your resplendent charms  but you had quitted the        sacred dome which you inhabit  and vouchsafed to bless some happier
