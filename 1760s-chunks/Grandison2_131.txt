I wish to stand in with you  is owing more to your brother s distinction of me  than to your own hearts   Lord L  I see not why we may not talk to my brother directly on this head  Whence is it that we are all three insensibly drawn in  by each other s example  to this distance between him and us —It is not his fault  Did we ever ask him a question  that he did not directly answer  and that without shewing the least affectation or reserve   Miss Gr  He came over to us all at once so perfect  after an eight or nine years absence  with so much power  and such a will  to do us good  that we were awed into a kind of reverence for him   Lady L  Too great obligations from one side  will indeed create distance on the other  Grateful hearts will always retain a sense of favours heaped upon them   Dr  B  You would give pain to his noble heart  did he think  that you put such a value upon what he has done  I do assure you▪ that he thinks he has hardly performed his duty  by his sisters  And  as occasions may still offer  you will find he thinks so  But let me beg of you to treat him without reserve or diffidence  and that you would put to him all those questions which you would wish to be answered  You will find him  I dare say  very candid  and very explicit   Miss Gr  That shall be my task  when I next see him  But  dear Doctor Bartlett  if you love us  communicate to us all that is proper for us to see  of the correspondence that passes between him and you   The Doctor  it seems  bowed  but answered not   So you see  Lucy  upon the whole  that I have no great reason to build so much  as my uncle  in his last Letter  imagines I do  on the interest of these Ladies and my Lord L  with their brother  Two or three  328intricate affairs on his hands  One of them still in suspense  of which for that reason he makes a secret  He is not quite happy  Greatly distinguished by the favour of worthy women  Who would wonder at that —But has paid dear for the distinction —What can one say  What can one think  He once said himself  That his life was a various life  and that some unhappy things had befallen him  If the prudence of such a man could not shield him from misfortune  who can be exempted from it —And from worthy women too —That s the wonder —But is this Olivia one of the worthy women —I fancy he must despise us all  I fancy he will never think of incumbering himself with one of a Sex  that has made him pay so dear for the general distinction he has met with from it  As to his politeness to us  a man may afford to shew politeness to those he has resolved to keep at distance   But  ah  Lucy —There must be one happy woman  whom he wishes not to keep at distance  This is the affair  that hangs in suspence  and of which  therefore  he chooses to say nothing   I HAVE had the pleasure of a visit from my godfather Deane  He dined with us this day in his way to town  The Ladies  Doctor Bartlett  and my Lord L  are charmed with him  Yet I had pain mingled with my pleasure  He took me aside  and charged me so home—He was too inquisitive  I never knew him to be so very urgent to know my heart  But I was frank  Very frank  I should hardly have been excuseable  if I had not  to so good a man  and so dear a friend  Yet he scarce knew how to be satisfied with my frankness   He will have it  that I look thinner and paler than I used to do  That may very well be  My very soul  at times—I know not how I am—Sir Charles is in suspense too  from somebody abroad  From my heart I   329 pity him  Had he but some faults  some great blemishes  I fancy I should be easier about him  But to hear nothing of him  but what is so greatly praiseworthy  and my heart so delighted with acts of beneficence—And now  my godfather Deane  at this visit  running on in his praises  and commending  instead of blaming me  for my presumptuous thoughts  nay  exalting me  and telling me  That I deserve him—that I deserve Sir Charles Grandison —Why did he not chide me  Why did he not dissuade me —Neither fortune nor merit answerable —A man who knows so well what to do with fortune —The Indies  my dear  ought to be his  What a king would he make  Power could not corrupt such a mind as his  Caesar  said Dr  Bartlett  speaking of him before Mr  Deane and all of us  was not quicker to destroy  than Sir Charles Grandison is to relieve  Emily s eye  at the
