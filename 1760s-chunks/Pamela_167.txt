linen of it for yourself and me       Then  sir  if you will sometimes indulge me with your company  I will   take an airing in your chariot now and then  and when you shall return   home from your diversions on the green  or from the chase  or where   you shall please to go  I shall have the pleasure of receiving you with   duty  and a cheerful delight  and  in your absence  count the moments   till you return  and you will  may be  fill up some part of my time  the   sweetest by far  with your agreeable conversation  for an hour or two   now and then  and be indulgent to the impertinent overflowings of my   grateful heart  for all your goodness to me       The breakfasting time  the preparations for dinner  and sometimes to   entertain your chosen friends  and the company you shall bring home with   you  gentlemen  if not ladies  and the supperings  will fill up a great   part of the day in a very necessary manner       And  may be  sir  now and then a good humoured lady will drop in  and    I hope  if they do  I shall so behave myself  as not to add to the   disgrace you will have brought upon yourself  for  indeed  I will be   very circumspect  and try to be as discreet as I can  and as humble too    as shall be consistent with your honour       Cards   tis true  I can play at  in all the usual games that our sex   delight in  but this I am not fond of  nor shall ever desire to play    unless to induce such ladies  as you may wish to see  not to abandon   your house for want of an amusement they are accustomed to       Music  which our good lady taught me  will fill up some intervals  if I   should have any       And then  sir  you know  I love reading and scribbling  and though all   the latter will be employed in the family accounts  between the servants   and me  and me and your good self  yet reading  at proper times  will   be a pleasure to me  which I shall be unwilling to give up  for the best   company in the world  except yours  And  O sir  that will help to polish   my mind  and make me worthier of your company and conversation  and    with the explanations you will give me  of what I shall not understand    will be a sweet employment  and improvement too       But one thing  sir  I ought not to forget  because it is the chief  My   duty to God will  I hope  always employ some good portion of my time    with thanks for his superlative goodness to me  and to pray for you and   myself  for you  sir  for a blessing on you  for your great goodness   to such an unworthy creature  for myself  that I may be enabled to   discharge my duty to you  and be found grateful for all the blessings   I shall receive at the hands of Providence  by means of your generosity   and condescension       With all this  sir  said I  can you think I shall be at a loss to pass   my time  But  as I know  that every slight to me  if I come to be so   happy  will be  in some measure  a slight to you  I will beg of you    sir  not to let me go very fine in dress  but appear only so  as that   you may not be ashamed of it after the honour I shall have of being   called by your worthy name  for well I know  sir  that nothing so   much excites the envy of my own sex  as seeing a person above them in   appearance  and in dress  And that would bring down upon me an hundred   saucy things  and low born brats  and I can t tell what       There I stopped  for I had prattled a great deal too much so early  and   he said  clasping me to him  Why stops my dear Pamela   Why does she not   proceed  I could dwell upon your words all the day long  and you shall   be the directress of your own pleasures  and your own time  so sweetly   do you choose to employ it  and thus shall I find some of my own bad   actions atoned for by your exemplary goodness  and God will bless me for   your sake
