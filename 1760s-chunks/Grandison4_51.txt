was insisted upon that we should have a dance  tho  we were engaged in a conversation  that I thought infinitely more agreeable   Lord G  began with dancing a minuet with his bride  She danced charmingly  But on my telling her so afterwards  she whispered me  that she should have performed better  had she danced with her brother  Lord G  danced extremely well   Lord L  and Lady Gertrude  Mr  Beauchamp and Mrs  Reeves  Mr  Reeves and Lady L  danced all of them very agreeably   The Earl took me out  But we had hardly done  when  asking pardon for disgracing me  as he too modestly expressed himself  he and all but my cousins and Emily  called out for Sir Charles to dance with me   I was abashed at the general voice calling upon us both  But it was obeyed   He deserved all the praises that Miss Gran—Lady G  I would say  gave him in her Letter to me  and had every one s silent applause  while we danced  so silent  that a whisper must have been heard  And when he lead me to my seat  every one clapt their hands  as at some well performed part  or fine sentiment  in a play—Lord bless me  my dear  this man is every thing  But his conversation has ever been among the politest people of different nations   Lord W  wished himself able  from his gout  to take out Miss Jervois  The Bridegroom was called upon by Sir Charles  and he took out the good girl  who danced very prettily  I fansied  that he chose to call out Lord G  rather than Mr  Beauchamp  He is the most delicate and considerate of men   Sir Charles was afterwards called upon by the Bride herself  And she danced then with a grace indeed  I was pleased that she could perform so well at her own wedding   Once more he and I were called upon  He  whisperingly    128 as if all the approbation so loudly given before  when we danced together  was due to me  and none to himself  condition d for me  with every one  that no notice should be taken of my performance  For he saw that I could hardly stand the applauses given on our dancing before   Sir Charles  when we had done  called me  inimitable  The word was caught by every mouth  and I sat down with reason enough for pride  if their praises could have elevated me  But I was not proud  My spirits were not high—I fansy  Lucy  that Lady Clementina is a fine dancer   Supper was not ready till twelve  Mr  Reeves s coach came about that hour  but we got not away till two  Perhaps the company would not have broke up so soon  had not the Bride been perverse  and refused to retire  Was she not at home  she asked Lady L  who was put upon urging her  And should she leave her company   She would make me retire with her  She took a very affectionate leave of me   Marriage  Lucy  is an awful rite  It is supposed to be a joyful solemnity  But on the woman s side it can be only so  when she is given to the man she loves above all the men in the world  and even to her  the anniversary day  when doubt is turned into certainty  must be much happier than the day itself  What a victim must that woman look upon herself to be  who is compelled  or even over persuaded  to give her hand to a man who has no share in her heart  Ought not a parent or guardian  in such a circumstance  especially if the child has a delicate  an honest mind  to be chargeable with all the unhappy consequences that may follow from such a cruel compulsion   But this is not the case with Miss Grandison  Early she cast her eye on an improper object  Her pride convinced her in time of the impropriety  And this  as she owns  gave her an difference to all men  She   129 hates not Lord G  There is no man whom she prefers to him  And in this respect  may perhaps  be upon a par with eight women out of twelve  who marry  and yet make not bad wives  As she played with her passion till she lost it  she may be happy  if she will  And since she intended to be  some time or other  Lady  G  her brother was kind in persuading her to shorten her days of coquetting and teazing  and allow him to give her to Lord G  before he went abroad   LETTER XVII  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   Wednesday  April 12   DR  Bardett was so good as to breakfast with my cousins and me this morning  He talks of setting out for Grandison hall on Saturday or Monday next  We have settled a correspondence  and he gives me hope  that he will make me a visit in Northamptonshire  I know you will all rejoice to see him   Emily came in
