for talking to you in this free manner  in   respect to your conduct  which I am sensible concerns only yourself     but as the errors you too have fallen into appear to have arisen merely   from inadvertency and mistake  I think it my duty to caution you   against the danger of them  particularly in your present situation    with which I have had the opportunity of being much better ac    quainted than you possibly can be  I was in the service long  very   long  before you were born  and have been intimate with many   chaplains  but never one who prostituted his character to humour   his company  who was not neglected by them when they had it   in their power to have served him   as  on the contrary  I have   known many instances of those who have reaped the happy fruits   of a regular and virtuous conduct  by which they acquired an   esteem that proved the foundation of their fortune   and if all   have not been equally successful  their disappointment must be   attributed to some other cause  I would not by this be under    stood to advise you to a morose distance and stiffness of behaviour    or asperity of reproof upon every occasion  They seldom  if ever    do good in any situation   in yours they will certainly do hurt  by   piquing false pride to act in opposition to them  without regard to   the consequences  An obliging temper  and a uniformly decent   conduct  lead insensibly to imitation  where contradiction or direct   admonition would be held impertinent  These hints are so obvious   that they may seem unnecessary   but it is want of attention to   them which has made so many chaplains miscarry in life  and   indeed has brought the very character into disrepute      ij  The chaplain  who wanted neither natural good sense  nor virtu    ous inclination  was struck with the justice and force of this rebuke    He thanked my master in the most ingenuous manner  and promised   to regulate his future conduct by his advice  Such a change at first   naturally exposed him to the merriment of his companions   but as   my master took his part  and showed them the injustice of such         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 339     behaviour  it soon wore off  and he had the heartfelt satisfaction   to find himself treated with friendly respect and confidence by   those whose gross familiarity had before often given him pain    as it evidently implied contempt          CHAPTER II     CHEYSAL DESCRIBES TBTTE COMPASSION   AND SHOWS THE GENERAL   CONSEQUENCE 01  A MAN s ACKNOWLEDGING DISTRESS  WITH THE   REASONS OF IT â€” CHBYSAL s MASTER IS PREVAILED UPON BT HIS   CAPTAIN TO TELL HIM THE CAUSE OF HIS MELANCHOLY  WHICH   IS REMOVED BY AN ACT OP UNCOMMON GENEROSITY â€” CHEYSAL   ENTERS INTO A NEW SERVICE     As the captain maintained the most friendly intercourse with   his officers  he soon observed that my master laboured under some   heavy distress of mind  This naturally raised his compassion     and as real compassion never sees distress which it is not desirous   of alleviating  he frequently took occasion  when they were by   themselves  to turn his discourse upon such subjects as he thought   might lead him to open himself   but finding that modesty or   reserve  contracted from long acquaintance with misfortune    and observation that the knowledge of a man s being in distress   always sinks him in the esteem of his companions  by cutting   off their hopes of service from him  and alarming their appre    hensions of his expecting assistance from them  prevented his   taking the hint  he resolved to break through forms and ask him   directly      Seeing him  therefore  one day walking the quarter deck in a   mood of deepest melancholy  he called him into the great cabin    and desiring him to sit down  after a little general chat    I fear    sir    said he    that something hangs upon your spirits  If it is   proper to be communicated  let me know what it is  and depend   upon every assistance in my power to make you easy  I ask not   from idle or impertinent curiosity         Sir    answered my master  struck with the manner in which   he spoke    I believe you above the influence of such motives  and   shall therefore obey your kind commands without scruple  It is   too true that I am unhappy   and I fear my unhappiness is too   common  I have devoted my life to a profession in which I
