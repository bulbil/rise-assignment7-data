her expense  and in so  doing applauded his own unmannerly ridicule  This supposition could not  fail of raising and reviving her indignation  while Peregrine highly  resented the indignity  with which he supposed himself treated  in their  attempting to make him the dupe of such a gross and ludicrous artifice   This being the situation of their thoughts  their mirth was succeeded by  a mutual gloominess of aspect  and the judge  addressing herself to Mr   Pickle  asked if he had anything to offer why sentence should not be  pronounced   Madam   answered the culprit   I am sorry to find myself  so low in the opinion of your cousin as to be thought capable of being  deceived by such shallow contrivance     Nay  sir   said Emilia   the  contrivance is your own  and I cannot help admiring your confidence in    6 22 15  3 45 PM   imputing it to me     Upon my honour  Miss Emily  resumed our hero   you  wrong my understanding  as well as my love  in accusing me of having  written such a silly  impertinent performance  The very appearance and  address of it is so unlike the letter which I did myself the honour  to write  that I dare say my man  even at this distance of time  will  remember the difference    So saying  he extended his voice  and beckoned to Pipes  who immediately  drew near  His mistress seemed to object to the evidence  by observing  that to be sure Mr  Pipes had his cue  when Peregrine  begging she would  spare him the mortification of considering him in such a dishonourable  light  desired his valet to examine the outside of the letter  and  recollect if it was the same which he had delivered to Miss Gauntlet  about two years ago  Pipes  having taken a superficial view of it   pulled up his breeches  saying   Mayhap it is  but we have made so many  trips  and been in so many creeks and corners since that time  that I  can t pretend to be certain  for I neither keep journal nor log book of  our proceedings   Emilia commended him for his candour  at the same  time darting a sarcastic look at his master  as if she thought he had  tampered with his servant s integrity in vain  and Peregrine began to  live and curse his fate for having subjected him to such mean suspicion   attesting heaven and earth in the most earnest manner  that far from  having composed and conveyed that stupid production  he had never seen  it before  nor been privy to the least circumstance of the plan   Pipes  now  for the first time  perceived the mischief which he had  occasioned  and  moved with the transports of his master  for whom he  had a most inviolable attachment  frankly declared he was ready to make  oath that Mr  Pickle had no hand in the letter which he delivered  All  three were amazed at this confession  the meaning of which they could  not comprehend  Peregrine  after some pause  leaped upon Pipes  and  seizing him by the throat  exclaimed  in an ecstasy of rage   Rascal   tell me this instant what became of the letter I entrusted to your  care   The patient valet  half strangled as he was  squirted a  collection of tobacco juice out of one corner of his mouth  and with  great deliberation replied   Why  burnt it  you wouldn t have me to give  the young woman a thing that shook all in the wind in tatters  would  you   The ladies interposed in behalf of the distressed squire  from  whom  by dint of questions which he had neither art nor inclination to  evade  they extorted an explanation of the whole affair   Such ridiculous simplicity and innocence of intention appeared in the  composition of his expedient  that even the remembrance of all the  chagrin which it had produced  could not rouse their indignation  or  enable the to resist a third eruption of laughter which they forthwith  underwent  Pipes was dismissed  with many menacing injunctions to beware  of such conduct for the future  Emilia stood with a confusion of joy and  tenderness in her countenance  Peregrine s eyes kindled into rapture   and  when Miss Sophy pronounced the sentence of reconciliation  advanced  to his mistress  saying   Truth is mighty  and will prevail   then  clapping her in his arms  very impudently ravished a kiss  which she had  not power to refuse  Nay  such was the impulse of his joy  that he took  the same freedom with the lips of Sophy  calling her his kind mediatrix  and guardian angel  and behaved with such extravagance of transport  as  plainly evinced the fervour and sincerity of his love   I shall not pretend to repeat the tender protestations that were uttered    6 22 15  3 45 PM   on one side  or describe the bewitching glances of
