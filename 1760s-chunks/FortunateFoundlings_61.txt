was rather inclined to   serious than the contrary  and that  joined with the reflections which   her good understanding was perpetually presenting her with  on the   uncertainty of her birth  the precariousness of her dependance  and her   enforced quitting the only person from whom she could expect the means   of any solid establishment in the world  had rendered her sometimes   extremely thoughtful  even in the midst of those pleasures that are   ordinarily most enchanting to one of her sex and age  But as she never   was elated with the respect paid to her supposed condition  so she never   was mortified with the consciousness of her real one  to a behaviour   such as might have degraded the highest birth  neither appearing to   expect it  or be covetous of honours  nor meanly ashamed of accepting   them when offered  And while by this prudent management she secured   herself from any danger of being insulted whenever it should be known   who she was  she also gave no occasion for any one to make too deep an   enquiry into her descent or fortune       But now the time was arrived when those deficiencies gave her more   anxiety than hitherto they had done  and love in one moment filled her   with those repinings at her fate  which neither vanity or ambition would   ever have had power to do       Melanthe here  as at Vienna  received the visits of all whose birth    fortune  or accomplishments  gave them a pretence  but there was none   who paid them so frequently  or which she encouraged with so much   pleasure as those of the count de Bellfleur  a French nobleman belonging   to the above mentioned prince of Conti  she often told Louisa  when they   were alone  that there was something in the air and manner of behaviour   of this count  which had so perfect a resemblance with that of Henricus    that tho  it reminded her of that once dear and perfidious man  she   could not help admiring and wishing a frequent sight of him  This was   spoke at her first acquaintance with him  but after some little time she   informed her  that he had declared a passion for her  He is not only   like Henricus in his person  said she  but appears to have the same   inclinations also   he pretends to adore me  continued she with a sigh    and spares no vows nor presents to assure me of it   something within   tempts me to believe him  and yet I fear to be a second time betrayed       Ah  madam  cried Louisa  in the sincerity of her heart  I beseech you to   be cautious how you too readily give credit to the protestations of a   sex  who  by the little observations I have made  take a pride in   deceiving ours   besides  the count de Bellfleur is of a nation where   faith  I have heard  is little to be depended on       Those who give them that character  replied Melanthe  do them an   infinite injustice   in politics  I allow  they have their artifices    their subterfuges  as well as in war  but then they put them in practice   only against their enemies  or such as are likely to become   so   wherever they love  or have a friendship  their generosity is   beyond all bounds         She pursued this discourse with a long detail of all she had ever read   or heard in the praise of the French  and did not forget to speak of the   prince of Conti as an instance of the gallant spirit with which that   people are animated       Louisa knew her temper  and that it would be in vain to urge any thing   in contradiction to an inclination she found she was resolved to   indulge  but she secretly trembled for the consequence  the count having   said many amorous things to herself before he pretended any passion for   Melanthe  and tho  he had of late desisted on finding how little she was   pleased with them  yet that he had done so was sufficient to convince   her he was of a wavering disposition  Melanthe was not  however  to be   trusted with this secret  she loved him  and jealousy  added to a good   share of vanity  would  instead of engaging any grateful return for a   discovery of that nature  have made her hate the person he had once   thought of as worthy of coming in any competition with herself  She   therefore indeed thought it best not to interfere in the matter  but   leave the event wholly to chance       The evening on the day in which this discourse had past between them    they went
