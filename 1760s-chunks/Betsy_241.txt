his addresses to herself  she   wished  at least  to make the experiment  and  to that end  resolved to   give no promise to Mr  Munden  yet would she not allow herself to think   she loved the other  but only that she would give him the preference  as   he was a match of more advantage       Nothing is more certain  nor  I believe  more obvious to the reader    than that this young lady  almost from the time of Mr  Trueworth s   quitting her  had entertained a growing inclination for him  which the   late service he had rendered had very much increased  but this her pride   would not suffer her to own  even to herself  as the comick poet truly   says             For whatso er the sages charge on pride        The angels fall  and twenty faults beside        On earth   tis sure   mong us of mortal calling        Pride saves man oft  and woman too  from falling                 CHAPTER XXI       Presents the reader with some prognosticks  on events in futuro          The reader will easily suppose that  in the present disposition of Miss   Betsy s heart  Mr  Munden met with but an indifferent reception from   her  she avoided his company as much as possible  and  when obliged to   receive a visit from him  could not bring herself to treat him with any   thing more than a cold civility  He complained of her cruelty  told her   he had expected better things from her after her brothers had approved   his flame  he pressed her  in the most pathetick terms he was master of    to let him know when the happy day would arrive  which should put an end   to the long series of his hopes and fears       It is certain  that if this gentleman had loved with that warmth and   sincerity which some men have done  he must have been very unhappy   during his courtship to Miss Betsy  but he was altogether insensible of   the delicacies of the passion he professed  he felt not the pains he   affected to languish under  he could support the frowns  or even the   slights  of his mistress  without any other anxiety than what his pride   inflicted       It was  therefore  rather owing to this last propensity in his nature    than any emotions of a real tenderness for Miss Betsy  which had made   him persevere in his addresses to her  All his acquaintance knew he had   courted her a long time  some of them had been witness of her treatment   of him  and he was unwilling it should be said of him  that he had made   an offer of his heart in vain       He had  at first  indeed  a liking for her person  he had considered her   beauty  wit  and the many accomplishments she was possessed of  were   such as would render his choice applauded by the world  The hopes of   gaining her in a short time  by the encouragement she had given his   addresses  had made him pursue her with vigour  but the delays  the   scruples  the capriciousness of her humour  the pretences she of late   had made to avoid giving him a definitive answer  had  at length  palled   all the inclination he once had for her  and even desire was deadened in   him  on so many disappointments       It is  therefore  a very ill judged thing in the ladies  to keep too   long in play the man they ever design to marry  and  with all due   deference to that great wit and poet  Sir John Suckling  there are very   few examples which verify his maxim  that              Tis expectation makes the blessing dear        According to my opinion  which is founded on observation  another   author  who wrote much about the same time with Sir John  has given us a   more true idea of what a tedious courtship may produce  especially on   the side of the man  In a matrimonial dialogue  he makes the husband   excuse the coldness complained of by his wife  in these terms             Unequal lengths  alas  our passions run        My love was quite worn out  ere yours begun        This being the case with Mr  Munden  it rendered Miss Betsy little less
