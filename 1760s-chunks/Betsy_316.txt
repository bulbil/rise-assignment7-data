 that she imagined she had only fled his   presence because she could not bear a man who had courted her so long   should see her thus unhappy by the choice she had made of another        I am well assured   cried she   that he has too much generosity to   triumph in my misfortune  and too much complaisance to remind me of the   cause  yet would his eyes tacitly reproach my want of judgment  and   mine  too  might perhaps  in spite of me  confess  as the poet says    that             I  like the child  whose folly prov d it s loss        Refus d the gold  and did accept the dross        This naturally leading her into some reflections on the merits of Mr    Trueworth  she could not help wondering by what infatuation she had been   governed when rejecting him  or  what was tantamount to rejecting him    treating him in such a manner as might make him despair of being   accepted    What  though my heart was insensible of love   said she   my   reason  nay  my very pride  might have influenced me to embrace a   proposal which would have rendered me the envy of my own sex  and   excited the esteem and veneration of the other   Thinking still more   deeply   O God   cried she with vehemence   to what a height of   happiness might I have been raised  and into what an abyss of   wretchedness am I now plunged   Irretrievably undone  married without   loving or being beloved  lost in my bloom of years to every joy that   can make life a blessing        Nothing so much sharpens the edge of affliction as a consciousness of   having brought it upon ourselves  to remember that all we could wish   for  all that could make us truly happy  was once in our power to be   possessed of  and wantonly shunning the good that Heaven and fortune   offered  we headlong run into the ills we mourn  rendering them doubly   grievous       This being the case with our heroine  how ought all the fair and young   to guard against a vanity so fatal to a lady  who  but for that one   foible  had been the happiest  as she was in all other respects the most   deserving  of her sex  But to return       A just sensibility of the errors of her past conduct  joined with some   other emotions  which the reader may easily guess at  though she as yet   knew not the meaning of herself  gave her but little repose that night    and  pretty early the next morning  she received no inconsiderable   addition to her perplexities       The time in which Mr  Munden had promised to give his answer to the   lawyer was now near expired  yet he was as irresolute as ever  loath he   was to have the affair between him and his wife made publick  and   equally loath to comply with her demands  Before he did either  it   therefore came into his head to try what effect menaces would produce    and accordingly wrote to her in these terms             To Mrs  Munden            Madam            Though your late behaviour has proved the little affection you have        for me  I still retain too much for you to be able to part with        you  No  be assured  I never will forego the right that marriage        gives me over you  will never yield to live a widower while I am a        husband  and  if you return not within four and twenty hours  shall        take such measures as the law directs  to force you back to my        embraces  By this time to morrow you may expect to have such        company at your levee as you will not be well pleased with  and        from whose authority not all your friends can screen you  but  as I        am unwilling to expose you  I once more court you to spare yourself        this disgrace  and me the pain of inflicting it  I give you this        day to consider on what you have to do  The future peace of us both        depends on your result  for your
