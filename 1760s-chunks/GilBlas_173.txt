ever work yourself up to the formidable resolution of marrying  I have heard you say a hundred times  in my childhood  that there was no benefit of clergy for a pretty woman who could commit such an offence as to take up with a husband  Times and seasons ebb and flow  my son  rejoined she  Men of the most resolute character may be shaken in their purposes  and do you require that a woman should be inflexible in hers  But I will now relate to you the story of my life since your departure from Madrid  She then began the following recital  which will never be obliterated from my memory  I will not withhold from you so curious a narrative   It is nearly thirteen years  if you recollect  said my mother  since you left young Leganez  Just at that time  the Duke of Medina Coeli told me that he had a mind to sup with me one evening in private  The day was fixed  I made preparations for his reception  he came  and I pleased him  He required from me the sacrifice of all his rivals  past  present  and to come  I came into his terms  in the hope of being well paid for my complaisance  There was no deficiency on that score  On the very next morning  I received presents from him  which were followed up by a long train of kindred attentions  I was afraid of not being able to hold in my chains a man of his exalted rank  and this apprehension was the better founded  because it was a matter of notoriety  that he had escaped from the clutches of several celebrated beauties  whose chains he had worn  only for the purpose of breaking  But for all that  so far from surfeiting on the relish of my kindness  his appetite grew by what it fed on  In short  I found out the secret of entertaining him  and impounding his heart  naturally roving  so that it should not go astray according to its usual volatility   He had now been my admirer for three months  and I had every reason to flatter myself that the arrangement would be lasting  when a lady of my acquaintance and myself happened to go to an assembly  where the duchess his wife was of the party  We were invited to a concert of vocal and instrumental music  We accidentally seated ourselves too near the duchess  who took it into her head to be affronted  that I should exhibit my person in a place where she was  She sent me word by one of her women  that she should take it as a favour if I would quit the room immediately  I sent back an answer  just as saucy as the message  The duchess  irritated to fury  laid her wrongs before her husband  who came to me in person  and said  Retire  Lucinda  Though noblemen of the first rank attach themselves to pretty playthings like yourself  it is highly unbecoming in you to forget your proper distance  If we love you better than our wives  we honour our wives more than you  whenever  therefore  your insolence shall go so far as to set yourselves up for their rivals under their very noses  you will always be mortified  and made to know your places   Fortunately the duke held his cruel language to me in so low a tone of voice as not to have been overheard by the people about us  I withdrew in deep confusion  and cried with vexation at having incurred such an affront  At once  to crown my shame and aggravate my chastisement  the actors and actresses got hold of the story on the very same evening  To do them justice  these gentry must contrive to entertain a familiar spirit  whose business is to fly about  and whisper in the ear of one whatever falls out amiss to the other  Suppose  for instance  that an actor gets drunk and makes a fool of himself  or an actress gets hold of a rich cully and makes a fool of him  The green room is sure to ring with all the particulars  and a few more than are true  All my kindred of the sock and buskin were informed at once of what had happened at the concert  and a blessed life they led me with their quips and quiddities  Never was there charity like theirs  Without beginning at home  heaven only knows where it ends  But I held myself too high to be affected by their jibes and jeers  nor did even the loss of the Duke de Medina Coeli hang heavy on my spirits  for true it was  I never saw him more at my toilette  but learned  a very short time after  that he had got into the trammels of a little warbler   When a theatrical lady has the good luck to be in fashion  she may change her lover as often as her petticoat  and one noble fool  should he even recover his wits at the end of three days  serves excellently well for a decoy to his successor  No sooner was it buzzed about Madrid  that the duke had raised the siege  than a new host of would be conquerors appeared before the trenches  The very rivals whom I had sacrificed to his
