suffer any one to   go in my company  for fear of putting the poor man or his family to   shame      Harry had not advanced fifty paces toward the hovel  when his   ears were struck with the sound of sudden and joint lamentation     and turning  he perceived that the inquisitive crowd had gathered   at his heels  My friends  says he  I entreat  I beseech you to leave   me for the present  I would not choose any witnesses to what I   am about  Pray  oblige me so far as to depart on your own   occasions      Hereupon  being loth to offend him  they retired a few steps  and   stood together aloof  attentive to the event of this uncommon   adventure      Mean while the cry continued with a bitterness that thrilled   through every nerve of our hero   and  as he now approached the   place  he did his utmost to restrain himself  and quell the feelings   within him  and he drew his hat over his eyes to prevent the parties   from seeing the emotion that they caused      The hovel was of mud walls  without any roofing  but  as   there was an opening where a door had once been  Harry stole   to the entrance  casting an under eye of observation about   him          286 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      Hereupon a woman turned  She had been fearfully peering over   the wall at the crowd which had not yet dispersed   but  having   notice of Hariy s entrance  she looked toward him  and dropped on   her knees      sir   she cried  if you are the gentleman who owned the loaf    for Christ his sake I pray you to have mercy upon us   Money  in    deed  we have not  but we have these shreds remaining  and we   will strip ourselves of our covering to make you a recompense    Alas   alas   could we have guessed how my husband came by it    we would have famished a thousand times rather than touch a   morsel  But he  dear good man  did it all for our sakes  for the   sake of the heavy burden with which he is overladen  Ah  I would   to heaven we were all dead  hanged  or drowned  out of his way     He might then walk the world at large  and be happy  as he   deserves      Here again she set up her wailing  which was accompanied by   her seven children  in such a woful concert as the heart of Harry   could not sustain  neither suffer him for a season to interrupt or   appease      At length he said with a faltering voice Pray  be not alarmed    madam  for I discern that you are a gentlewoman  though in a very   unhappy disguise  The affair of the loaf is settled to your satis    faction   and here are ten guineas  it is all that I have about me    and it is only to show you for the present that you are not quite so   friendless in the world as you thought  Mean time I request that   you will all come with me to Hampstead  where we will try to do   something better for you      Here the woman looked with an earnest and eager rapture at   him  May Jesus Christ  she cried  be your portion  fair angel   and   he is already your portion   he is seen in your sweet face  and   breaks out at your eyes in pity to poor sinners      Harry was now stepping forth  and the rest prepared to follow   him  when the poor man  who for shame had not yet uttered a   syllable  gently stayed him at the opening  Turn  generous master    said he   pray turn  and hear a small apology for my transgression    I am a very unhappy man  I have seen better times  but I am   driven by cruel usage from house  and home  and maintenance  I   was going to London to apply to the law for relief  when my   youngest child  who was on the breast  fell desperately sick about   four days ago  As we had no money to hire lodging  and had   begged the means of life for the two foregoing days  we were com    pelled to take up with this shelterless hovel  From hence I fre    quented the road  and for the last three days begged as much as   sustained us in coarse bread and water  But this morning my boy   died  and his brothers
