triangle   He was ashamed  however  to fail in his undertaking  and persevered with  great industry  until he had finished the first four books  acquired  plane trigonometry  with the method of algebraical calculation  and  made himself well acquainted with the principles of surveying  But no  consideration could prevail upon him to extend his inquiries farther  in this science  and he returned with double relish to his former  avocations  like a stream  which  being dammed  accumulates more force   and  bursting over its mounds  rushes down with double impetuosity   Mr  Jolter saw with astonishment and chagrin  but could not resist the  torrent  His behaviour was now no other than a series of license and  effrontery  prank succeeded prank  and outrage followed outrage with  surprising velocity  Complaints were every day preferred against him  in  vain were admonitions bestowed by the governor in private  and menaces  discharged by the masters in public  he disregarded the first  despised  the latter  divested himself of all manner of restraint  and proceeded  in his career to such a pitch of audacity  that a consultation was held  upon the subject  in which it was determined that this untoward spirit  should be humbled by a severe and ignominious flogging for the very next  offence he should commit  In the mean time  Mr  Jolter was desired to  write in the masters name to the commodore  requesting him to remove Tom  Pipes from the person of his nephew  the said Pipes being a principal  actor and abettor in all his malversations  and to put a stop to the  monthly visitations of the mutilated lieutenant  who had never once  failed to use his permission  but came punctual to a day  always fraught  with some new invention  Indeed  by this time Mr  Hatchway was as well  known  and much better beloved  by every boy in the school than the  master who instructed him  and always received by a number of scholars   who used to attend Peregrine when he went forth to meet his friend  and  conduct him to his lodging with public testimonies of joy and applause   As for Tom Pipes  he was not so properly the attendant of Peregrine   as master of the revels of the whole school  He mingled in all their  parties  and superintended the diversions  deciding between boy and boy   as if he acted by commission under the great seal  He regulated their  motions by his whistle  instructed the young boys in the games of  hustle cap  leap frog  and chuck farthing  imparted to those of a more  advanced age the sciences of cribbage and all fours  together with the  method of storming the castle  acting the comedy of Prince Arthur  and  other pantomimes  as they commonly exhibited at sea  and instructed  the seniors  who were distinguished by the appellation of bloods  in  cudgel playing  dancing the St  Giles s hornpipe  drinking flip  and  smoking tobacco  These qualifications had rendered him so necessary and  acceptable to the scholars  that exclusive of Perry s concern in the  affair  his dismission  in all probability  would have produced some  dangerous convulsion in the community  Jolter  therefore  knowing his    6 22 15  3 45 PM   importance  informed his pupil of the directions he had received  and  very candidly asked how he should demean himself in the execution   for he durst not write to the commodore without this previous notice   fearing that the young gentleman  as soon as he should get an inkling of  the affair  would follow the example  and make his uncle acquainted  with certain anecdotes  which it was the governor s interest to keep  concealed  Peregrine was of opinion that he should spare himself the  trouble of conveying any complaints to the commodore  and if questioned  by the master  assure him he had complied with his desire  at the same  time he promised faithfully to conduct himself with such circumspection  for the future  that the masters should have no temptation to revive  the inquiry  But the resolution attending this extorted promise was too  frail to last  and in less than a fortnight our young hero found himself  entangled in an adventure from which he was not extricated with his  usual good fortune   CHAPTER XVII   He is concerned in a dangerous Adventure with a certain  Gardener  Sublimes his Ideas  commences Gallant  and becomes acquainted  with Miss Emily Gauntlet   He and some of his companions one day entered a garden in the suburbs   and  having indulged their appetites  desired to know what satisfaction  they must make for the fruit they had pulled  The gardener demanded  what  in their opinion  was an exorbitant price  and they with many  opprobrious terms refused to pay it  The peasant  being surly and  untractable  insisted upon his right  neither was he deficient or  sparing in the eloquence of vulgar abuse  His guests attempted to  retreat  a scuffle ensued  in which Peregrine lost his cap  and the  gardener
