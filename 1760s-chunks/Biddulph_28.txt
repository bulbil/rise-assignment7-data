guilt  and perhaps  poor easy creature  blames her own weakness only for the error which a concealed train of cunning and perfidy might have led her into   But even supposing Miss B  were generous and candid enough  and great indeed must be her candour and generosity  to justify this guilty man  What would it avail  Did not my mother tell me she conceived a sort of horror at the bare idea of an union between Mr Faulkland and me  This arises from the strong impression made on her by the unlucky event which blasted her own early love  Strong and early prejudices are almost insurmountable   My mother’s piety  genuine and rational as it is  is notwithstanding a little tinctured with superstition  it was the error of her education  and her good sense has not been able to surmount it  so that I now the universe would not induce her to change her resolution in regard to Mr Faulkland  She thinks he ought to marry miss B  and she will ever think so  I wish he would  for I am sure he never can be mine  The bell rings for breakfast  I must run down  My mother came up to dress just now  and stepped into my room  I returned her the letter  and she asked me  What I thought of Mr Faulkland’s request  madam  you are a better judge of the propriety of it than I am  I shall have no objection to seeing the unhappy lady  said she  since it seems he has apprised her of my knowlege of her affairs  I am glad he has the grace to shew even so much compassion for her  perhaps it may be the beginning of repentance  and time may work a thorough reformation in him  if God spares him his life and his senses  You see which way my good mother’s thoughts tended  I did not  she added  intend to return to London again  but this occasion  I think  calls upon me  and I believe I shall go for a while  in order to see and comfort this poor young creature  She cannot yet be near lying in  and I suppose she will not come to the house Mr Faulkland speaks of  till she can no longer remain undiscovered at home  so that a month or two hence will be full soon enough for me to think of going to town     I saw my mother rested her compliance with Mr Faulkland’s request  merely on one point  that of compassion to the girl  As for the other motive  said she  the hearing him justified from the Lady’s own mouth  I am not such a novice in those matters  but that I know when a deluding man has once got an ascendency over a young creature  he can coax her into any thing  Too much truth I doubt there is in this observation of my mother’s   But it is time to say something of lady Grimston  My Cecilia has never seen her  though I believe she has often heard my mother speak of her  They are nearly of an age  and much of the same cast of thinking  though with this difference  that lady Grimston is extravagantly rigid in her notions  and precise in her manner  She has been a widow for many years  and lives upon a large jointure at Grimston hall  with as much regularity and solemnity  as you would see in a monastery  Her servants are all antediluvians  I believe her coach horses are fifty years of age  and the very house dog is as grey as a badger  She herself  who in her youth never could have been handsome  renders herself still a more unpleasing figure  by the oddity of her dress  you would take her for a lady of Charles the first’s court at least  She is always dressed out  I believe she sleeps in her cloaths  for she comes down ruffled  and towered  and flounced  and fardingal’d  even to breakfast  My mother has a very high opinion of her  and says  she knows more of the world than any one of her acquaintance  It may be so  but it must be of the old world  for lady Grimston has not been ten miles from her seat these thirty years  ’Tis nine years since my mother and she met before  and there was a world of compliments passed between them  though I am sure they were sincerely glad to see each other  for they seem to be very fond  They were companions in youth  that season wherein the most durable friendships are contracted  I believe her really a very good woman  she is pious and charitable  and does abundance of good things in her neighbourhood  though I cannot say I think her amiable  There is an austerity about her that keeps me in awe  notwithstanding that she is extremely obliging to me  and told my mother  I promised to make a fine woman  Think of such a compliment to one of almost nineteen  My mother and she call one another by their christian names  and you would smile to hear the two old ladies  begging their pardons   Lettying and Dollying one another  This accounts to me for lady Grimston’s thinking me still a child  for I suppose
