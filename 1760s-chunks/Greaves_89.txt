 throw up his eyes to heaven in the most emphatic silence  then convey the child hastily to his mother s arms  pull his hat over his eyes  stalk out into the common walk  and  finding himself alone  break out into tears and lamentation    Ah  little did this unhappy couple know what further griefs awaited them  The smallpox broke out in the prison  and poor Tommy Clewline was infected  As the eruption appeared unfavourable  you may conceive the consternation with which they were overwhelmed  Their distress was rendered inconceivable by indigence  for by this time they were so destitute  that they could neither pay for common attendance  nor procure proper advice  I did on that occasion what I thought my duty towards my fellow creatures  I wrote to a physician of my acquaintance  who was humane enough to visit the poor little patient  I engaged a careful woman prisoner as a nurse  and Mr  Norton supplied them with money and necessaries  These helps were barely sufficient to preserve them from the horrors of despair  when they saw their little darling panting under the rage of a loathsome pestilential malady  during the excessive heat of the dog days  and struggling for breath in the noxious atmosphere of a confined cabin  where they scarce had room to turn on the most necessary occasions  The eager curiosity with which the mother eyed the doctor s looks as often as he visited the boy  the terror and trepidation of the father  while he desired to know his opinion  in a word  the whole tenor of their distress baffled all description    At length the physician  for the sake of his own character  was obliged to be explicit  and  returning with the captain to the common walk  told him  in my hearing  that the child could not possibly recover  This sentence seemed to have petrified the unfortunate parent  who stood motionless  and seemingly bereft of sense  I led him to my apartment  where he sat a full hour in that state of stupefaction  then he began to groan hideously  a shower of tears burst from his eyes  he threw himself on the floor  and uttered the most piteous lamentation that ever was heard  Meanwhile  Mrs  Norton being made acquainted with the doctor s prognostic  visited Mrs  Clewline  and invited her to the lodge  Her prophetic fears immediately took the alarm   What   cried she  starting up with a frantic wildness in her looks   then our case is desperate—I shall lose my dear Tommy —the poor prisoner will be released by the hand of Heaven —Death will convey him to the cold grave   The dying innocent hearing this exclamation  pronounced these words   Tommy won t leave you  my dear mamma  if death comes to take Tommy  papa shall drive him away with his sword   This address deprived the wretched mother of all resignation to the will of Providence  She tore her hair  dashed herself on the pavement  shrieked aloud  and was carried off in a deplorable state of distraction    That same evening the lovely babe expired  and the father grew frantic  He made an attempt on his own life  and  being with difficulty restrained  his agitation sunk into a kind of sullen insensibility  which seemed to absorb all sentiment  and gradually vulgarised his faculty of thinking  In order to dissipate the violence of his sorrow  he continually shifted the scene from one company to another  contracted abundance of low connexions  and drowned his cares in repeated intoxication  The unhappy lady underwent a long series of hysterical fits and other complaints  which seemed to have a fatal effect on her brain as well as constitution  Cordials were administered to keep up her spirits  and she found it necessary to protract the use of them to blunt the edge of grief  by overwhelming reflection  and remove the sense of uneasiness arising from a disorder in her stomach  In a word  she became an habitual dram drinker  and this practice exposed her to such communication as debauched her reason  and perverted her sense of decorum and propriety  She and her husband gave a loose to vulgar excess  in which they were enabled to indulge by the charity and interest of some friends  who obtained half pay for the captain    They are now metamorphosed into the shocking creatures you have seen  he into a riotous plebeian  and she into a ragged trull  They are both drunk every day  quarrel and fight one with another  and often insult their fellow prisoners  Yet they are not wholly abandoned by virtue and humanity  The captain is scrupulously honest in all his dealings  and pays off his debts punctually every quarter  as soon as he receives his half pay  Every prisoner in distress is welcome to share his money while it lasts  and his wife never fails  while it is in her power  to relieve the wretched  so that their generosity  even in this miserable disguise  is universally respected by their neighbours  Sometimes the recollection of their former rank comes over them like a qualm  which they dispel with brandy  and then humorously rally one another on their mutual degeneracy  She often stops me in the walk  and  pointing to the captain
