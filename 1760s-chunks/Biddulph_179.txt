liveries behind it  One of these brought me a note from Mr Warner  who informed  me that he had sent my own equipage to carry me home  where I should find him waiting to welcome me to my own house   Patty seemed to have got wings to her feet  she flew up to me with the welcome notice  and begged of me to observe from the window  that the servants were in our own family livery  with this difference  that the lace was silver instead of what we used to give   On expressing my surprise at this  Patty told me that Mr Warner had  at his second visit  enquired of her  as she let him out  what liveries we used to give  but bid her not mention it to me  which she said she would not do  as she guessed he meant to surprise me  But this was not all  he had been so minutely correct  as to have the Arnold arms in a lozenge elegantly painted on the doors  what these were  he was at the pains of informing himself elsewhere  My Patty almost frantick with joy hurried the two children down stairs  and stuck them up in the chariot  telling them both it was their own as she put them into it  but the poor babes fell a crying  and were not to be pacified by the novelty or finery of the thing till I came to them  She staid behind to send our little baggage after us  and I drove to my new house in Pall mall  where I found my generous benefactor waiting  as he had promised  to receive me     Oh my dear he is a princely man  such grandeur  such elegance  he led me thro’ every room  where wealth and magnificence were displayed even to profusion  From top to bottom there is not the smallest article wanting that luxury itself can imagine  The carpets  skreens  cabinets  and an abundance of fine china  are beyond comparison more beautiful than any thing of the kind I have ever seen  ’Tis but eleven days since my kinsman mentioned his design to me  and you must believe he has been indefatigable in his diligence  since he has left nothing for me to do  but at once to take possession of this splendid mansion  All the necessary domesticks are hired  and ready in their respective stations  and I am already as much settled in a few hours  as if I had lived here so many years   Mr Warner told me that as a trifle would not be sufficient to keep up every thing in proportionable state about me  he intended to allow me three thousand pounds a year  This appointment  said he  you are to consider as your own property  and just call upon me as you would on your steward  I am sure you will employ it well  you gave me a proof of that in your five shillings  You need not be afraid of being too profuse in your charities  when I die you will find yourself possessed of the means of continuing them   Dear Sir  said I  long may you live to feel and rejoice in the blessings which your bounty will  through me  I hope  draw down on us both  I leave you to enjoy yourself  said he  but I am impatient till your brother knows what he has lost by his hard heartedness  He cannot long be ignorant of it  Sir  replied I  but indeed I flatter myself that he is not quite so much to blame in regard to me  as we have both imagined  You see he seemed to know nothing of my situation when you enquired after me  and even threw out something like a reproach for my having withdrawn myself without acquainting him where I was  I am very sure lady Sarah never informed him of my having applied to her —It was his duty to have enquired you out  said he  did he not know you were poor  He knew  said I  that my circumstances were very much streighten’d  but he did not know how much  Well  well  answered Mr Warner  it is good in you to excuse him  but I know him to be a narrow hearted poltroon  He took his leave  and said he would see me soon again  having taken lodgings for himself in my neighbourhood   February 23  I begin to doubt  my Cecilia  whether I am really awake or not  ’Tis    all enchantment  I am afraid my old kinsman is a wizard     I have been talking to  and examining my servants  to see if they are real living people  or only phantoms  I look at  and handle the rich furniture of my apartments to try if it be substantial —’Tis all so—every thing real—I beg my cousin’s pardon for suspecting him of sorcery  I believe he deals in no charms  but that all powerful one—money   Now  my sister  what a spacious field is there opened before me  Three thousand pounds a year  how many hearts will it be in my power to make glad  and I will make many glad   ‘O Lord God  who hast showered down thy blessings in abundance on my head
