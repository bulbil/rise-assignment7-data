to my writings   the sea which   flows around that island being not more unsteady than the minds of   the inhabitants  nor more liable to be ruffled by the winds of heaven    than they are by every breath of popular rumour  I proceeded   thus for some time with various success  till  happening to disclose   some secret transactions  which were known there only to the persons   concerned  and had been communicated to me from abroad  in   order to sow dissension between the people and their governors    to the ruin of both  the conscious parties were alarmed  and my   intelligence traced so secretly  that I had difficulty to escape by   flight from an ignominious death  which the resentment of those    whose ruinous machinations I had thus discovered to their country    would certainly have brought me to  My failing in this attempt    in which thousands had failed before me  was no prejudice to my   character  nor in the least lessened me in the opinion of the order    On the contrary  the efforts I had made were so daring  so deeply   laid  and so well conducted   that I was now judged a proper person   to be employed in greater matters        I was therefore sent the next year to what is called the Spanish   world  but is really the Jesuits  heaven in America  where matters of   the highest moment were just ripe for execution  When I came   there  I found things in a forwardness too great for their foundation    the eagerness of some of our people hurrying on events before proper   preparation had ensured their success  In short  they were ready   to revolt from Spain and Portugal before they had made provision   to support themselves in such an attempt  They wanted European   officers  soldiers  arms  and ammunition  for on the natives there is   no dependence   but  above all  the time was unfavourable  The   powers they meant to attack in this vital part were at peace with   all the world  and consequently at liberty to turn their whole force   against them        I therefore counselled them to moderate their zeal  and wait   till better preparations and a more favourable minute should make   their success more probable  But they would not hearken to my         244 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     advice  but attributed it to envy or want of resolution  on which I   left them to their own ill fortune  and hasted home to provide a   remedy for evils which I could not prevent            CHAPTER XXVI     CONTINUATrON OF THE JESUIt s DISCOURSE â€” HE SHOWS THE PKOMIS    ING SITUATION OF HIS AFFAIRS AT PRESENT â€” THE CONCISE METHOD   BY WHICH SPAIN AND PORTUGAL ARE TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE   WAR WITH ENGLAND â€” HE PROPOSES TO HIS BROTHER TO JOIN IN   THE GENERAL  THAT HE MAY ACCOMPLISH HIS PARTICULAR DESIGN       The event has confirmed my opinion   by striking too soon  the   blow has been ineffectual  However  things  though disconcerted   by this precipitancy  are not quite ruined  and care may yet repair   the effects of their folly        In this cause I now labour in concert with others of my brethren   in every court of Europe  and I have the satisfaction to think that   we have a prospect of success  The only obstacle that retards us   at present is the difficulty of making the courts of Spain and Portugal    enter into the war against England  Could we bring this to bear    our work would be easy  The mighty naval power of England will   not only prevent their sending over forces to oppress us before we   can establish our power  but will also assist us to carry on the war    to share in the spoil  and distress our enemies  But while the   present kings are on the thrones of those kingdoms  it will be scarcely   possible to bring our designs to perfection  they are so utterly averse   to hazarding the consequences of a war with a nation from whose   alliance they receive such advantages  The first thing  therefore    which we do  must be to remove them  The former has already   swallowed his death  though the process will be so slow as to escape   suspicion  With the other  such caution is not necessary  nor is   there time for it   the arm is already lifted up against him  for a   stroke that will terrify the world   V Tien these obstacles are re    moved  the execution of our designs will meet with no further delay    The successors to these princes we have secured such
