help thinking  my Cecilia  that there is a sort of fatality has attended Mr Faulkland’s attachment to me  By what a strange accident did we come to the knowledge of Miss Burchell’s affair  How strong were my mother’s prepossessions against Mr Faulkland  and how many little circumstances concurred her to encourage in this disposition  His letter from Bath to my brother helped to confirm her in her dislike of his conduct  Miss Burchell’s letter to Mr Faulkland  though meant very differently  was a strong motive of condemnation  The only means of justification left for him  my mother did not apply to  till it was too late  and then that very circumstances of it’s being too late to serve him  Miss Burchell acknowleges  was the reason that the very method which he had proposed for his defence  was turned to his condemnation   Rooted  as my mother’s prejudices were  she engages herself  she engages me  in a promise  to use my endeavours to promote Miss Burchell’s marriage with Mr Faulkland  Does this not look as if some unseen power  who guides our actions  had set a stamp of disapprobation on the union between this man and me   I wish I had seen that letter which Mr Faulkland wrote to my brother from Bath  my mother said  she did not read it through  He treated the subject lightly  and there was one circumstance in    particular in it that shocked her  and yet surely  if the whole might not have borne a favourable construction  Sir George would not have shewn her that account  by way of justifying his friend  This reflection comes too late  Why did it not occur sooner to my mother or to me  We drew no other inference from Sir George’s disclosing this letter  than that as Mr Faulkland treated the affair ludicrously  it was therefore expected  both by him and my brother  that we should consider it so too  That could not have been the case  Miss Burchell’s confession has opened my eyes —Poor Mr Faulkland  What wayward fate is thine  But let me beware of relenting  that might be fatal  There is still one indelible blot remains upon his conduct  Miss Burchell  blameable as she acknowleges herself  was still betrayed  and though not by Mr Faulkland  yet sure his having paid the price of her innocence to the wicked aunt  renders him so far guilty  as that he owes her a great reparation  This was a particular I durst not touch upon  the unhappy girl herself being ignorant of it  There is a wide gulph fixed between Mr Faulkland and me  How many things are leagued against him  Alas  he thinks the principal bar to his hopes is removed  and that if Miss Burchell has been just  he ought to be forgiven  But he little knows thy Sidney’s heart  critically delicate as my situation is  in regard him  I am removed a thousand times farther than ever from his wishes  Neither knows he the engagements I am under to Miss Burchell  which alone would put an ever lasting bar between us  Unhappy Miss Burchell  She has bound me to her by stronger ties than ever  She has been ingenuous  she has owned her weakness to me  she declares she would have done this sooner  if it could have promoted my happiness  perhaps she would  shall I not then endeavour to promote her’s  I will  I must  my word is given  Yet Faulkland deserves—oh  he deserves a worthier lot     VOLUME III      June 22  I now send you  my Cecilia  my second Letter to Mr Faulkland   ‘Why do you compel me  Sir  noble and disinterested as your conduct has been towards me  to accuse you now of unkindness  You call me insensible—oh  it is from my too great sensibility that all my sorrows have sprung  Destitute as I am of happiness myself  or even of a possibility of ever attaining it here  I look for no other comfort in this life  but what must arise from seeing those whom I most esteem in possession of that tranquillity of mind  which I can never hope to enjoy  If Mr Faulkland were happy  if Miss Burchell were happy  I should be less miserable  Remember  Sir  it was not this lady’s fault that you were disappointed in your former hope  She did not try  by female wiles  to engage a heart which you refused her  She used no ungenerous arts to cross your wishes  Loving you as she did  almost to distraction  she yielded you up in silent anguish to a rival  a rival superior to herself in nothing  I acknowlege  Sir  I was to have been yours  and with my own consent  but was it not also with my own consent those bonds were cancelled  by which we were to have been united  I was then convinced Miss Burchell had a prior claim  I think so still  and ever shall  Miss Burchell’s family is not mean  her fortune is considerable  her beauty and personal accomplishments inferior to none  and  but for Mr Faulkland  she had been innocent  Yet do not imagine I would aggravate your fault  Miss Burchell’s candor could not suffer
