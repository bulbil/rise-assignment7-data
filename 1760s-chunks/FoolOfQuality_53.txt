 For some time after his arrival at the mansion house  Harry   appeared thoughtful and greatly dejected  which they ascribed to   his parting with his old friend   but Harry had schemes in his head   that they were little able to fathom or guess at  Having peeped   about for some time  he found a knife in a window  which he   instantly seized upon  and then stole up  with all possible privacy    to his apartment      There he stripped himself in a hurry  and falling as quickly to   work  began to cut and rip and rend away the lacings of his suit    without sparing cloth or seam  While lie was thus in the heat   and very middle of his business  he heard himself repeatedly called         22 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      on the stairs   and hurrying on his clothes to obey the summons  he   ran down to the parlour  with half the trimmings hanging in   fritters and tatters about him      The droll and very extraordinary figure that he cut  struck all   the company into utter amazement  Having gazed on him for   some time in a kind of silent stupor Why  Harry  cries my lady    what s all this for  Who abused you  my child who put you in   this pickle  Come hither  and tell me who spoiled your clothes    I did  madam  You did  sirrah  cried my lady  giving him a shake     and how dare you spoil them   Why  because they wanted to spoil   me  said Harry  And who told you they would spoil you  sirrah    I won t tell  said Harry  I ll lay a wager  cried my lady  it   was that old rogue with the beard  but I ll have him whipped   for a fool and a knave out of the parish  Pray  my dear  be patient   a little  said his lordship  Come here  Harry  and tell me the truth   stoutly  and no harm shall happen to you  or your dada with the   beard  Come  speak  what fault did he find with your clothes    Why  sir  he said they would poison me  Poison you  my dear     pray  how was that  Why  sir  he told me there was a little   master called Hercules  and he was a mighty good boy  and was   cold and hungry  and almost naked  and did not matter so as he   could do good to every body   and every body loved him with   all their heart  And then  he told me  he got a mighty fine coat    and looked here and looked there  and minded nothing but his   coat   and how his coat poisoned him  and would not let him do any   more good  and how all the boys then hated him  and scorned him    sir and how I believe that s all  sir       Here my lord and lady took such a chink of laughing  that it   was some time before they could recover  while Harry looked   abashed and disconcerted  But my lord recollecting himself  took   the child on his knee  and warmly pressing him to his bosom I   must tell you  my Harry  said he  how you are a mighty good boy    and how your dada with a beard is a mighty good dada  and has   told you all that is right and true   and that I will go myself  one   of these days  and thank him in person  Thank you  sir  says   Harry      Well  Harry  said my lord  I promise that no one shall poison   you any more with my consent  Whereupon another new suit was   immediately appointed  of a kind that should fear no weather   nor    in case of dirt or damage  draw upon Harry the resentment or   admonitions of his mamma      Just as dinner was served up  Mr  Meekly entered and took his   seat  He came in order to conciliate a late difference between the   earl and Sir Standish Stately   and in this he found no manner of   difficulty  as my lord was by nature of a kindly disposition  and   required no more than a first advance to be reconciled to any man      During the entertainment  Harry kept his eyes fixed on Mr    Meekly  and  as soon as the cloth was off  he rose  went over to   him  looked fondly in his face  and took hold of his hand with the   familiarity of an old acquaintance      e Mr  Meekly
