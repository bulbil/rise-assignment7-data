conquest which  at another time  perhaps  would have been the highest gratification to my vanity  now served only to wound my sensibility  and to fill me with the most poignant distress   The wretched Louisa still continuing fixed with her elbows on her knees  her head supported by her two hands  and her face covered with her handkerchief  I walked over to her chair in a state of united anguish and irresolution—bleeding for what I saw her suffer  yet fearing to offer her the smallest consolation—However  instinctively dropping upon one knee  I begged she would be composed    70 and assured her that what had happened rather enhanced than lessened my affection  and that  as I was her husband in every thing but the ceremony  there was no offence whatsoever committed against virtue—Form  I observed  was alone what we had violated  and  as the secret was entirely confined to ourselves  there was little occasion either for confusion or regret   We are all of us  my dear Melmoth  ready enough to believe what we wish may be true  and poor Louisa  though she could not be convinced by the force of my reasonings  nevertheless attempted to be chearful  she wiped her charming eyes therefore  and seemed delighted at the respectful attitude in which she beheld me  for I still continued on my knee  and endeavoured  by all the little tendernesses in my power  to raise her   71 into credit with herself—I talked familiarly about the wedding day  called her my wife in the most melting accent I could possibly assume  and  at intervals  took the liberty of chiding her anxiety as an equal doubt of my honour and my love—At last  I succeeded pretty well in re assuring her  she ventured to look up with an air of some confidence  condescended to play with my fingers  and even once went so far as to honour my hand with her lips—I need scarcely inform you what the consequence was—The tide of passion was in an instant swelled up to the customary height—and every impulse of recollection was again swept away upon the couch   Such  Melmoth  is the present situation of affairs between Louisa and your unfortunate friend  what to do I know not—You are not to be told how romantically delicate I am in my notions   72 about women —It is with me a fixed principle  that the same woman who suffers even the man she doats upon to distraction  to take advantage of an unguarded moment  will have her unguarded moments with other people—Passion will  in all probability  often supply the want of inclination  and the same warmth of constitution which originally betrayed her into an indiscretion with him  is but too likely to make her guilty of indiscretions with every body else  How frequently  Charles  in the keeness of appetite  have I  where more agreeable dishes were not immediately at hand  fallen greedily upon such fare as actually turned my stomach when I came to consider it  Women  like ourselves  are only flesh and blood—desires are as natural to them as to us  and who can take upon him to say  when the favourite object of their wishes is at any distance  but   73 what necessity may immediately metamorphose a piece of coarse beef into an absolute ortolan   This  you will possibly observe  is bringing a general charge against the sex  and supposing that there is no such thing as virtue existing in any individual of the whole—An opinion of such a nature is what I am neither base enough nor weak enough to adopt—Coxbomb as I may be in some respects  and greatly as my vanity has been flattered by success among the ladies  still I was never one of those fellows who thought the sex universally depraved—On the contrary  I dare say there are thousands who are capable of resisting the deepest subtleties of the most plausible design—But where we have ourselves experienced the frailty of a woman  it is natural enough to form an idea upon what we know  and reasonable enough   74 to judge  from her behaviour in one or two circumstances  what her conduct is likely to be in all   After a declaration of this kind  you may probably imagine that I do not intend marrying Miss Mildmay  notwithstanding the treaty has been carried so far between the two families  you are  however  much mistaken  Greatly as this unhappy affair has sunk her in my opinion  I shall nevertheless pay a rigid attention to the sanctity of my word—But though I shall behave with justice  I shall also act with candour —I shall inform her how utterly impossible it will be for her ever to recover my confidence after what has past  and if she is weak enough to accept my hand while I make a positive avowal of my contempt  why  she must abide by the consequence   This morning she came down to breakfast with an encreased degree of   75 beauty  if it is possible for such beauty to admit of an encrease—The delightful consciousness that flushed upon her cheek  enlighted her complexion into an absolute blaze of perfection  while the speaking sensibility of a down cast eye threw such a modesty over her features  as rendered her the finest picture which fancy could conceive of the softest innocence and love  Her father  charmed with her appearance  turned round
