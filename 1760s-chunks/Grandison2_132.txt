time  ran over with joy at the expression  and  drying them  she looked proudly round on us all  as if she had said  This is my guardian   But what do you think  Lucy  My godfather will have it  that he sees a young passion in Miss Jervois for her guardian —God forbid —A young Love may be conquered  I believe  but who shall caution the innocent girl  She must have a sweet pleasure in it  creeping  stealing  upon her  How can so unexperienced an heart  the object so meritorious  resist or reject the indulgence  But  O my Emily  sweet girl  do not let your Love get the better of your gratitude  lest it make you unhappy  and  what would be still more affecting to a worthy heart  make the generous object of a passion that cannot be gratified  unhappy  and for that very reason  because he cannot reward it  See you not already  that  with all his goodness  he is not quite happy  He is a sufferer from worthy women —O my Emily  do not you add to the infelicity of a man  who can make but one  330 woman happy  yet wishes to befriend all the world—But  hush  selfish adviser  Should not Harriet Byron have thought of this in time —Yet she knew not  that he had any preivous engagements  And may death lay his cold hand upon her heart  before she become an additional disturbance to his  He knows not  I hope he guesses not  tho  Dr  Bartlett has found me out as well as the sisters  that I am captivated  heart and soul  by his merits  May he never know it  if the knowledge of it would give him the shadow of uneasiness   I owned to Mr  Deane  that my Lord L  and the Ladies were warmly interested in my favour  Thank God for that  he said  All must happen to his wish  Nay  he would have it  that Sir Charles s goodness would be rewarded in having such a wife  But what wife can do more than her duty to any husband who is not absolutely a savage  How then can all I could do  reward such a man as this   But  Lucy  don t you blush for me  on reading this last  of my writing  You may  since I blush myself on re perusing it  For shame  Harriet Byron  put a period to this Letter —I will  nor subscribe to it so much as the initials of my name   LETTER XXXIV  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  To Dr  BARTLETT   Inclosed in the preceding    Friday  Mar  17   LAST night I saw interred the remains of my worthy friend Dr  Danby  I had caused his two nephews and his niece to be invited  But they did not attend   As the will was not to be opened till the funeral   331 was over  about which the good man had given me verbal directions  apprehending  I believe  expostulations from me  had I known the contents  I sent to them this morning to be present at the opening   Their Attorney  Mr  Sylvester  a man of character  and good behaviour  brought me a Letter  signed by all three  excusing themselves on very slight pretences  and desiring that he might be present for them  I took notice to him  that the behaviour of his principals over night and now  was neither respectful to the memory of their uncle  nor civil  with regard to me  He honestly owned  that Mr  Danby having acquainted his two nephews  a little before he died  that he had made his will  and that they had very little to expect from him  they  who had been educated by his direction  and made merchants  at his expence  with hopes given them  that he would  at his death  do very handsomely for them  and had never disobliged him  could not be present at the opening of a will  the contents of which they expected to be so mortifying to them   I opened it in presence of this gentleman  The preamble was an angry one  giving reasons for his resentment against the father of these young persons  who  tho  his brother  had once  as I hinted to you at Colnebrooke  made a very shocking attempt upon his life  I was hurt  however  to find a resentment carried so far as against the innocent children of the offender  and into the last will of so good a man  that will so lately made  as within three weeks of his death  and he given over for three months before   Will the tenderness due to the memory of a friend permit me to ask  where would that resentment have stopt  had the private man been a monarch  which he could carry into his last will   But see we not  on the other hand  that these   332 children  had they power  would have punished their uncle  for disposing  as he thought fit  of his own fortune  no part of which came to him by inheritance
