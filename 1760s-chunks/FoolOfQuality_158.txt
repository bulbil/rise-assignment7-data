by the chariot of his malefactor  They   chatted  as they went  about the prices of cattle and improvement   of lands  the fall and rise of grain  the necessity of industry  and    above all  of the advantage of good enclosures  which  as the   sergeant observed  were emblems of the English laws  and secured   every man s property from question or encroachment      While thus they beguiled the way  Walter led his respectable   patron through this field and that field  and through yon gate   and the other gate  and now went ahead like a fox  and now   doubled like a hare   till  having mazed it and circled it for the   space of three hours  he finally conducted the sergeant to the   very gate at which he had first entered      How  how   exclaims the sergeant  methinks we are just where   we set out   we have not gained an inch of ground by the many   miles we have travelled       Quite as much  replied Walter  in a journey of three hours  as   your honour gained for me in a journey of thirteen years   and I   leave you as you left me just where you found me      Your story  cried Mr  Fenton  is as pleasant as it is apt   and   reminds me of an observation made by Henry IV  of France  that is   equally pertinent to the subject      A certain judge of a court of law in that kingdom had grown   aged on the bench  and honoured by the innumerable sentences   which he had passed  and which were all deemed conformable to   the most perfect measure and dispensation of equity  The gainers   of the several suits applauded his discernment and justice to the   skies  and even the losers allowed that they had no right to com    plain  The fame of his wisdom and integrity reached the throne    The monarch was curious to see and judge of so peculiar a cast   and character  and he sent for him under colour of thanking him   for the great honours which he had done to his regency      After a most gracious reception  and some compliments at the   levee  the prince took him apart  and in confidence said        My lord judge  the infinite complaints that come before me   from all parts of the kingdom  respecting the erroneous or   iniquitous sentences daily passed by your fraternity  cast the   highest lustre on the singularity of your conduct  and give me an   eager curiosity to know by what measures you have been enabled         THE FOOL OF QUALITY          153         to content all parties  I adjure you  then  by all that you re    verence  to disguise nothing from me on this head  You have not   any thing to fear from my censure of means that have proved   so very successful  and you have all things to hope from my   approbation       The judge thereupon cast himself at the feet of his prince  and   rising  addressed him thus         To you  my sovereign  as to heaven  I will open my whole soul    In the first place  in order to enable myself to give a guess whether   the judgments to be pronounced might be right or wrong  I gave   all possible attention to the merits of each case during the   process   I daily took minutes of the pleadings on either side   I   enlarged and commented on those minutes while matters were   fresh in my memory   and I never interrupted any cause till it   had run itself out of breath through the circuit of forms and due   course of law        In the next place  may it please your majesty  I never took   bribe or present of any land  or from any hand  lest favour or incli    nation should insensibly tempt me to cog  or give a partial turn   to the final cast        Thus prepared  as soon as matters were ripe for a decree that   is to say  as soon as the respective lawyers had agreed among them    selves that nothing more was to be said  or any thing more to be   got  on either side of the question I summoned up the repugnant   merits so equally and impartially  with respect to circumstance    evidence  and ordinance of law  as induced both parties  now   wearied and wishing for rest  to think that the decree must in    evitably be given against themselves  and  having
