last  This parliament began with redressing grievances  they proceeded to reform the state  and ended in totally destroying the constitution   I am   c     16  LETTER  III   IN treating of a subject  in which almost every Englishman is partial  it is no easy matter to avoid falling into their errors  but  I have laboured to view this part of our history  without receiving any biass from party  and our constitution is now sufficiently established  whatever we may think of this Monarch s equity  or his subjects resolution  Our laws  at present  differ both from what Charles endeavoured to maintain  and what his parliaments pretended to enact  we now are all agreed  that the unlimited power arrogated on one side  and the tumultuous freedom introduced on the other  are both intolerable  yet  of the two  perhaps  despotism is superior  In a republic  the tyrant is in our village  in our family  perhaps  in a monarchy  he lives at a distance  the oppressions of a Monarch are generally exerted only in the narrow sphere round him  the oppressions of the governors of a republic  though not so flagrant  are more universal  the Monarch is apt to commit great enormities  but they seldom reach the multitude at humble distance from the throne  the republican Despot oppresses the multitude that lies within the circle of his influence  the Monarch terrifies me with great evils which I may never feel  the Despot actually loads me with submissions  which I am constantly obliged to sustain  and  in my opinion  it is much better to be in danger of having my head chopped off  with an ax  once in my life  than to have my leg gauled with a continual fetter   Whatever were the reasonings of the King  upon this subject  it is certain  his actions were intended for the benefit of his subjects  but he continued to rule them  upon the maxims of former princes  at a time that the principles of the subjects were totally changed  The house of commons seemed now to have thrown off all subordination  they not only arraigned   17 and attained almost all the King s ministers  particularly Laud  Strafford  Finch  and Windebanck  but passed an act to make that parliament continual  until all grievances should be redressed  The King complied with every measure  yet all his compliance only served to increase their demands  The Earl of Strafford first fell a victim to their popular fury  the commons exhibited an accursation  of twenty eight articles against him  the substance of which was  That he had attempted to extend the King s authority at home  and had been guilty of several exactions in Ireland  These received the name of high treason  and the people without demanded justice  The managers for the house of commons pleaded  with vehemence  against him at the bar of the house of Lords  who were his Judges  they insisted  that  though each article seperately did not amount to a proof  yet  the whole taken together carried conviction  This is a method of arguing frequently used in the English courts of justice  even to this day  and  perhaps  none can be more erroneous  for almost every falshood may thus be defended by a multiplicity of weak reasons  In this tumult of aggravation and clamour  the Earl himself  whose parts and wisdom had long been respected and acknolwedged  stood unmoved  He defended his innocence with all the presence of mind  judgment  and temper  that could be expected from innocence and ability  His little children were placed near him  as he was thus defending his own cause  and that of his master  after he had  with a long and eloquent speech  delivered extempore  confuted the accusation of his enemies  he thus drew to a conclusion    But  my Lords  I have troubled you too long  longer than I should have done  but  for the sake of those dear pledges  a saint  in heaven  has left me —  Upon this he paused  dropped a tear  looked upon his children  and then proceeded —What I   18 forfeit  for myself  is a trifle  that my indiscretions should reach my posterity  wounds me to the heart  Pardon my infirmity —Something I should have added  but am not able  therefore  let it pass  And now  my Lords  for myself  I have long been taught   that the affictions of this life are overpaid by that eternal weight of glory  which awaits the innocent  and so  my Lords  even so  with the utmost tranquility I submit myself to your judgment  Whether that judgment be life  or death  TE DEUM LAUDAMUS   His eloquence and innocence seemed to influence his Judges  the King himself went to the house of Lords  and spoke in his defence  but the spirit of the people was excited  and nothing  but his blood  would give them satisfaction  He was condemned by both houses  and nothing now remained  but for the King to give his consent to the bill of attainder  But his consent seemed of little consequence  the limits of royalty were
