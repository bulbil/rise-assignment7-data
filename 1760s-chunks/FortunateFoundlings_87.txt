like him  to hear a mouth   accustomed to the greatest reserve  utter exclamations so soft  so   engaging  so convincing to him that he was no less dear to her than he   could even wish to be   He threw himself at her feet  and even thought   that posture not humble enough to testify  as it deserved  his gratitude   and joy  But she not suffering him to continue in it  he took the hand   that raised him  kissed off the tears which had fallen from her eyes   upon it  with speechless extacies  and seemed almost beside himself at   the concern she could not yet overcome  on the bare imagination of   losing him in the way he mentioned  If you love me  said she tenderly    you will endeavour to preserve yourself   I have now put myself under   your protection  by consenting to do as you would have me  and have no   other from whom I would receive those favours I expect from you   think   not  therefore  that I will perform my promise  unless you give me   yours  not to be so covetous of fame as to court dangers  nor  in too   eager a pursuit of glory  to lose the remembrance of what you owe   to love       Oh thou divinest softness  cried he  be assured I will put nothing to   the venture that might take me from Louisa   Your kindness  my angel    has shewed me the value of life  and almost made a coward of your   lover   no farther will I go than the duties of my post oblige me  and   that honour  which to forfeit  would render me unworthy of your care       Louisa now found herself so much at ease  in having discovered a secret   she had so long laboured with  and suffered an infinity of pain in the   concealing of  that nothing could be more chearful than her looks and   behaviour  He  on the other hand  was all rapture  yet did it not make   him in the least forgetful of the rules he had prescribed himself  or   give her modesty any room to repent the confession she had made in   favour of his passion   the conversation between them was all made up of   innocence and love  and every hour they passed together  rendered them   still dearer to each other       Monsieur du Plessis having thus gained the point his soul was let on    began to consider in what part of Italy it would be best to place his   dear Louisa  as Bolognia was a free country  under the jurisdiction of   the Pope  he thought she would there be the least subject to alarms  on   account of the army s continual marches and countermarches thro  most   other parts of Italy  He therefore got a post chaise  and by easy   journeys conducted her thither  and having made an agreement with the   lady abbess of the Augustines  she was welcomed into the convent by the   holy sisterhood with all imaginable good nature and politeness       It would be endless to recite the farewels of these equally sincere  and   passionate lovers  so I shall only say that never any parting was more   truly touching  and the grief  which both of them endured  was only   alleviated by the confidence they had in each other s affection  and the   mutual promises of communicating the assurances of persevering in it  by   letters as often as opportunity would permit       Melanthe being recovered of the indisposition of her body  tho  not of   her mind  was informed of every particular of her perfidious lover s   conduct as he had quitted Venice before she did her chamber  was obliged   to bear the load of discontent her too easy belief had brought upon her    without even the poor ease of venting it in reproaches on him  The   carnival soon after ending  and finding that change of place was no   defence from misfortunes of the kind she had sustained  without she   could also change her way of thinking  took the first convenience that   offered  and returned to England  rather in worse humour than she   had left it             CHAP  XVII        Horatio arrives at Warsaw  sees the coronation of Stanislaus and his   queen  his reception from the king of Sweden  his promotion  follows   that prince in all his conquests thro  Poland  Lithuania and Saxony  The   story of count Patkul and madame de Eusilden        While these things were transacting in Italy  Horatio  animated by love   and glory  was pursuing his journey to Poland  His impatience was so   great
