 she regards not whether it is a China cup  or a cork  that she pats and tosses about  But her sport will certainly be the death of Lord G s happiness  Pity that Sir Charles  who only has power over her  is obliged to go abroad so soon  But she has principles  Lady Grandison s daughter  Sir Charles Grandison s sister  must have principles  The solemnity of the occasion  the office  the church  the altar —must strike her  The vow—Will she not regard the vow she makes in circumstances so awful  Could but my Lord G  assume dignity  and mingle raillery with it  and be able to laugh with her  and sometimes at her  she would not make him her sport  She would find somebody else  A butt she must have to shoot at  But I am afraid he will be too sensible of her smartness  And she will have her jest  let who will suffer by it   Some of the contents of your last are very agreeable to me  Lucy  I will begin in earnest to think   105 of leaving London  Don t let me look silly in your eyes  my dear  when I come  It was not so very presumptuous in me  was it  to hope —When all his relations—When he himself—Yet what room for hope did he  could he  give me  He was honest  and I cheated myself  But then all you  my dearest friends  encouraged the cheat  Nay  pointed my wishes▪ and my hopes  by yours  before I had dared  shall I say  o• condescended   to own them to myself   You may let that Greville know  if your please  that there is no room for his If s  nor  of consequence  any for his menaces  You may own  that I shall soon be in Northamptonshire  This may prevent his and Fenwick s threatened journey to town   But  Lucy  tho  my heart has been ever dutifully  as I may say  open to the venerable domestic circle  tho  it would not have been an honest heart  could it  circumstanced as I was  have concealed itself from Lady D   and must have been an impenetrable one indeed  if it could have been disguised to the two sisters here—yet  I beseech you  my dear  almost on my knees I beseech you  let not the audacious  the insulting Greville  have ground given him to suspect a weakness in your Harriet  which indelicate minds know not how to judge of delicately  For sex sake  for examplesake  Lucy  let it not be known to any but the partial  friendly few  that our grandmamma Shirley s child  and aunt Selby s niece  has been a volunteer in her affections  How many still more forward girls would plead Mrs  Shirley s approbation of the hasty affection  without considering the circumstances  and the object  So the next girl that run away to a dancing master  or an ensign  would reckon herself one of Harriet s school   Poor Mr  Orme  I am sorry he is not well  It is cruel in you  Lucy  at this time  to say  so undoubtingly  that his illness is owing to his love of me    106 You knew that such a suggestion would pain me  Heaven restore Mr  Orme   But I am vex d  as it cannot be to purpose  that Sir Charles Grandison and I have been named together  and talked of  in your neighbourhood —He will be gone abroad  I shall return to Northamptonshire  And shall look so silly  So like a refused girl    Every body gives me to him  you say —So much the worse  I wonder what business this every body has to trouble itself about me   One consolation  however  I shall have in my return  and that is  in my Nancy s recover d health  which was so precarious when I set out for London   But I shall have nothing to entertain you with when I am with you  Sir Charles Grandison  Lord and Lady L  Lady G   as now in three or four days she will be  my dear Miss Jervois  Dr  Bartlett  will be all my subject  And have I not exhausted that by pen and ink  O no  The doctor promises to correspond with me  and he makes no doubt but Sir Charles will correspond with him  as usual   What can the unusually tender friendship be called which he professed for me  and  as I may say  claimed in return from me  I know that he has no notion of the Love called Platonic  Nor have I  I think it  in general  a dangerous allowance  and  with regard to our sex  a very unequal one  since while the man has nothing to fear  the woman has every thing  from the privileges that may be claimed  in an acknowleged confidence  especially in presence  Miss Grandison thus interprets what he said  and strengthens her opinion by some of Dr  Bartlett s late intimations  that he really loves me  but not being at
