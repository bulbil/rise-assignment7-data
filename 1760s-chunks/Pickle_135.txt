of manners and taste  Pickle pretended to acquiesce in the truth  of their mutual severity  which  indeed  was extremely just  and by  malicious insinuations blew up their contention  with a view of bringing  it to open hostility  But both seemed so averse to deeds of mortal  purpose  that for a long time his arts were baffled  and he could  not spirit them up to any pitch of resentment higher than scurrilous  repartee   Before they reached Arras  the city gates were shut  so that they  were obliged to take up their lodgings at an indifferent house in the  suburbs  where they found a couple of French officers  who had also rode  post from Paris so far on their way to Lisle  These gentlemen were about  the age of thirty  and their deportment distinguished by such an air  of insolence  as disgusted our hero  who  nevertheless  accosted them    6 22 15  3 45 PM   politely in the yard  and proposed that they should sup together  They  thanked him for the honour of his invitation  which  however  they  declined upon pretence of having ordered something for themselves   but promised to wait upon him and his company immediately after their  repast   This they accordingly performed  and  after having drunk a few glasses  of Burgundy  one of them asked  if the young gentleman would  for  pastime  take a hand at quadrille  Peregrine easily divined the meaning  of this proposal  which was made with no other view than that of  fleecing him and his fellow travellers  for he well knew to what shifts  a subaltern in the French service is reduced  in order to maintain the  appearance of a gentleman  and had reason to believe that most of them  were sharpers from their youth  but  as he depended a good deal upon his  own penetration and address  he gratified the stranger s desire  and a  party was instantly formed of the painter  the physician  the proposer   and himself  the other officer having professed himself utterly ignorant  of the game  in the course of the play  he took his station at the back  of Pickle s chair  which was opposite to his friend  on pretence of  amusing himself with seeing his manner of conducting the cards  The  youth was not such a novice but that he perceived the design of this  palpable piece of behaviour  which  notwithstanding  he overlooked for  the present  with a view of flattering their hopes in the beginning   that they might be the more effectually punished by their disappointment  in the end   The game was scarce begun  when  by the reflection of a glass  he  discerned the officer at his back making signs to his companion  who   by preconcerted gestures  was perfectly informed of the contents of  Peregrine s hand  and  of consequence  fortunate in the course of play   Thus they were allowed to enjoy the fruits of their dexterity  until  their money amounted to some louis  when our young gentleman  thinking  it high time to do himself justice  signified in very polite terms to  the gentleman who stood behind him  that he could never play with ease  and deliberation when he was overlooked by any bystander  and begged  that he would have the goodness to be seated   As this was a remonstrance which the stranger could not  with my show  of breeding  resist  he asked pardon  and retired to the chair of the  physician  who frankly told him  that it was not the fashion of his  country for one to submit his hand to the perusal of a spectator  and  when  in consequence of this rebuff  he wanted to quarter himself upon  the painter  he was refused by a wave of the hand  and shake of the  head  with an exclamation of pardonnez moi  which was repeated with such  emphasis  as discomposed this effrontery  and he found himself obliged  to sit down in a state of mortification   The odds being thus removed  fortune proceeded in her usual channel   and though the Frenchman  deprived of his ally  endeavoured to practise  divers strokes of finesse  the rest of the company observed him with  such vigilance and caution  as baffled all his attempts  and in a very  little time he was compelled to part with his winning  but  having  engaged in the match with an intention of taking all advantages   whether fair or unfair  that his superior skill should give him over the  Englishman  the money was not refunded without a thousand disputes  in  the course of which he essayed to intimidate his antagonist with high  words  which were retorted by our hero with such interest as convinced    6 22 15  3 45 PM   him that he had mistaken his man  and persuaded him to make his retreat  in quiet  Indeed  it was not without cause that they repined at the  bad success of their enterprise  because  in all likelihood  they had  nothing to depend upon
