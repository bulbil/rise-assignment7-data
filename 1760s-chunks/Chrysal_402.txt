and at length   to fly from it  when he found it could not be any longer prevented    by such finesses  from bursting on his head  Such a flight was an   implicit acknowledgment of his guilt  He was  therefore  deprived   of his part in the legislature  and consequently of all the immunities   annexed to it  and given up to the common course of the laws  for   that and others matters  whenever he should be found within the   reach of their power  Nor was this all   To show still stronger   â  disapprobation of his conduct  the breach of those immunities    upon which tlie magistrate had founded his discharge from con    finement  was overlooked  and such offences as his excluded from   their protection for the future      You cannot be surprised at his meeting such a fate  The tools   of a statesman  however successful they may have been  are always   thrown aside with neglect the moment they have done their work    but when they fail  however blamelessly  or run into any error    though onlj  from excess of zeal  the weight of the neglect is made still   heavier  by heaping all the blame upon them  But what will you   think  when I tell you that  uneqiial as he must appear to have been   to such an attempt  in consequence  cliaracter  and abilities  he raised   so threatening a storm that the minister thought proper to retire   out of its way   as all his friends apprehended they should have   been obliged to follow him  a success for which lie was in great   measure indebted to the assistance of my late master  who repre    sented their private characters in such colours  in his satirical   writings  as will make their memories pay a dear price for their   power  the poetical merit of his works  in which their names are   branded with indelible infamy  ensuring their immortality  Such    is the basis upon which statesmen found their greatness  and so   easily is a jealous populace led away by anything that flatters   their present humour      I say not this  as deciding upon the merit of the disputes in which   he was concerned  I think too meanly of human politics in general   to give my opinion in favour of any one scheme of them  in prefer    ence to another  They are all alike a jumble of villany and blunders    All I intend is to show on what a sandy foundation men who value   themselves upon their wisdom wear out their lives in anxious toils   and dangers  to build their hopes   and what unworthy means are   often made use of to overturn them  and work ends  reputed great   on purpose  perhaps  to humble man in his own eyes  As for   my master  he was no sooner removed out of the sight of the mob   whose idol he had been in such an extravagant degree  than he was   entirely out of their mind  and the storm he had raised subsided   so totally as to leave no other trace behind it but his ruin      I have observed your anxiety to know whether he ever obtained   redress for the injustice done him in his property  and the injurious   treatment he received when he was first apprehended  as I said         486 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     that the fellowa employed to take him  had  under the sanction   of authority  committed all the outrages of lawless ruffians  The   interest you take in the cause of such a man can arise from nothing   but your love of justice  which should not be violated in the person   of the most unjust  It will  therefore  give you pleasure to be   informed that the laws of your country never shone with brighter   lustre than in this instance  In despite of every artifice and effort   which power and chicane could make use of to evade  or intimidate   from the execution of them  a striking instance of the latter of   which was depriving his patron of every degree of power and honour    of which he could be deprived without regard to his great services   and personal consequences  only for appearing in his cause   an able   and upright magistratei supported them with such resolution and   judgment  that he obtained exemplary redress for all he had suffered   that could be redressed  as did several others  who had been involved   in the sa me circumstances  as having been employed by him      In gratification to your curiosity  I have thus given you the   general heads of his story  To have dwelt on the minute cir    cumstances  however curious in themselves  would have led me too
