  lover  and also with some other particulars          Though Lady Mellasin had seemed to blame Miss Betsy for not having   communicated to Mr  Goodman what her brother wrote to her in relation to   Mr  Trueworth  yet in her heart she was far from being averse to her   receiving a plurality of lovers  because whenever that young lady should   fix her choice  there was a possibility some one or other of those she   rejected might transmit his addresses to her daughter  who she was   extremely desirous of getting married  and had never yet been once   solicited on honourable terms  she therefore told her husband  that he   ought not to hinder Miss Betsy from hearing what every gentleman had to   offer  to the end she might accept that which had the prospect of most   advantage to her       Mr  Goodman in this  as in every thing else  suffered himself to be   directed by her judgment  and the next morning  when Miss Betsy came   down  talked to her with his usual pleasantry   Well   said he   have   you forgiven my ill humour last night  I was a little vexed to think my   friend Staple had so poor a chance for gaining you  and the more so    because Frank Thoughtless will take it ill of me that I have done any   thing in opposition to the person he recommends  but you must act as you   please  for my part I shall not meddle any farther in these affairs         Sir   replied Miss Betsy very gravely   I shall always be thankful to   my friends for their advice  and whenever I think seriously of a   husband  shall not fail to intreat yours in my choice  but   continued   she   one would imagine my brother  by writing so pressingly to you    wanted to hurry me into a marriage whether I would or no  and though I   have as much regard for him as a sister can or ought to have  yet I   shall never be prevailed upon by him to enter into a state to which at   present I have rather an aversion than inclination         That is   said Mr  Goodman   you have rather an aversion than an   inclination to the persons who address you on that score     No  Sir     answered she   not at all  the persons and behaviour both of Mr    Trueworth and Mr  Staple appear to me to be unexceptionable  but sure   one may allow a man to have merit  and be pleased with his conversation    without desiring to be tacked to him forever  I verily believe I shall   never be in love  but if I am  it must be a long length of time  and a   series of persevering assiduities must make me so        Mr  Goodman told her these were only romantick notions  which he doubted   not but a little time would cure her of  What reply Miss Betsy would   have made is uncertain  for the discourse was interrupted by a footman   delivering a letter to her  in which she found these lines             To Miss Betsy Thoughtless            Fair creature            I am no courtier  no beau  and have hitherto had but little        communication with your sex  but I am honest and sincere  and you        may depend on the truth of what I say  I have  Heaven be praised         acquired a very large fortune  and for some time have had thoughts        of marrying  to the end I might have a son to enjoy the fruits of        my labours  after I am food either for the fishes or the worms  it        is no great matter which of them  Now I have been wished to several        fine  women  but my fancy gives the preference to you  and if you        can like me as well  we shall be very happy together  I spoke to        your guardian yesterday   for I love to be above board  but he        seemed to dour  or as we say at sea  to be a little hazy on the        matter  so I thought I would not trouble him any further  but write        directly to you  I hear there are two about you  but what of that
