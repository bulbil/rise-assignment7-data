 with her own delicate hands  rectified the mistake of Dolly  who still continued to sob  and said   Yau may think  my Leady Darnel  as haw I aive yeaten hool cheese  but it y an t soa  I se think  vor mai peart  as how I aive bean bewitched    Sir Launcelot could not help smiling at the simplicity of Dolly  whose goodness of heart and attachment Aurelia did not fail to extol  as soon as her back was turned  It was in consequence of this commendation  that  the next time she entered the room  our adventurer  for the first time  considered her face  and seemed to be struck with her features  He asked her some questions  which she could not answer to his satisfaction  applauded her regard for her lady  and assured her of his friendship and protection  He now begged to know the cause that obliged his Aurelia to travel at such a rate  and in such an equipage  and she informed him of those particulars which we have already communicated to our reader   Sir Launcelot glowed with resentment  when he understood how his dear Aurelia had been oppressed by her perfidious and cruel guardian  He bit his nether lip  rolled his eyes around  started from his seat  and striding across the room   I remember   said he   the dying words of her who now is a saint in heaven   That violent man  my brother in law  who is Aurelia s sole guardian  will thwart her wishes with every obstacle that brutal resentment and implacable malice can contrive   What followed  it would ill become me to repeat  But she concluded with these words   The rest we must leave to the dispensations of Providence   Was it not Providence that sent me hither to guard and protect the injured Aurelia   Then turning to Miss Darnel  whose eyes streamed with tears  he added   Yes  divine creature  Heaven  careful of your safety  and in compassion to my sufferings  hath guided me hither  in this mysterious manner  that I might defend you from violence  and enjoy this transition from madness to deliberation  from despair to felicity    So saying  he approached this amiable mourner  this fragrant flower of beauty  glittering with the dew drops of the morning  this sweetest  and gentlest  loveliest ornament of human nature  He gazed upon her with looks of love ineffable  he sat down by her  he pressed her soft hand in his  he began to fear that all he saw was the flattering vision of a distempered brain  he looked and sighed  and  turning up his eyes to heaven  breathed  in broken murmurs  the chaste raptures of his soul  The tenderness of this communication was too painful to be long endured  Aurelia industriously interposed other subjects of discourse  that his attention might not be dangerously overcharged  and the afternoon passed insensibly away   Though he had determined  in his own mind  never more to quit this idol of his soul  they had not yet concerted any plan of conduct  when their happiness was all at once interrupted by a repetition of cries  denoting horror  and a servant coming in  said he believed some rogues were murdering a traveller on the highway  The supposition of such distress operated like gunpowder on the disposition of our adventurer  who  without considering the situation of Aurelia  and indeed without seeing  or being capable to think on her or any other subject for the time being  ran directly to the stable  and  mounting the first horse which he found saddled  issued out in the twilight  having no other weapon but his sword   He rode full speed to the spot whence the cries seemed to proceed  but they sounded more remote as he advanced  Nevertheless  he followed them to a considerable distance from the road  over fields  ditches  and hedges  and at last came so near  that he could plainly distinguish the voice of his own squire  Timothy Crabshaw  bellowing for mercy  with hideous vociferation  Stimulated by this recognition  he redoubled his career in the dark  till at length his horse plunged into a hole  the nature of which he could not comprehend  but he found it impracticable to disengage him  It was with some difficulty that he himself clambered over a ruined wall  and regained the open ground  Here he groped about  in the utmost impatience of anxiety  ignorant of the place  mad with vexation for the fate of his unfortunate squire  and between whiles invaded with a pang of concern for Aurelia  left among strangers  unguarded  and alarmed   In the midst of this emotion  he bethought himself of hallooing aloud  that  in case he should be in the neighbourhood of any inhabited place  he might be heard and assisted  He accordingly practised this expedient  which was not altogether without effect  for he was immediately answered by an old friend  no other than his own steed Bronzomarte  who  hearing his master s voice  neighed strenuously at a small distance  The knight  being well acquainted with the sound  heard it with astonishment  and  advancing in the right direction
