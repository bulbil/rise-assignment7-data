broke silence by lamenting this fatal discovery  which he  industriously represented as in the highest degree dangerous and  terrible  The Monk could scarcely restrain his impatience  at the  affected air of superiority which his brother assumed  and  the insolence of reproof and censure which his words conveyed  Grey  as  if still desirous to mortify him to the utmost  continued his discourse  by observing with what zeal he had laboured to recommend a man to the  notice of Lord Raymond  who  he feared  must now appear  in the general  eye  as unworthy of the favour of this Lord  and that he himself must  share in his disgrace  — Dog   exclaimed the Monk  flying furiously upon  his brother  who was alarmed  and retired from his violence  which he  endeavoured to allay  by hastily promising his friendly interposition  with Lord Raymond — Thy interposition   cried Reginhald         Am I to depend on thee  thou caitiff  Is this my reward  Am I to sue  thee for the protection of thy great friends  Who was it that saved them  and their pernicious minion from disgrace and ruin  Thou  indeed   could st steal away from sanctuary the infant heir of Salisbury  but  this was the daring hand which presented the fatal draught to the  father         —Here a loud and piercing shriek broke off their discourse  Ela and her  kind attendant had taken their seat unnoticed  in an adjoining bower   and heard the last passionate exclamations of the Monk  The emotions of  the Countess was too great to be suppressed  The brother started  were  confounded  and hastily separated  whilst Elinor fled with frantic speed  to summon assistance to her mistress   She was soon conveyed to her chamber  and laid upon her couch  languid  and silent  Elinor hung over her with streaming eyes  and ever and anon  entreated her to give vent to her sorrows  but they were too great for  utterance  Her eyes indeed were sometimes raised to heaven with all the  expression of silent misery  and then  again  gently closed  as if  inviting the kind and healing hand of death to cover them in eternal  darkness  But no complaints did she breathe  no exclamations of anguish  did she utter  At length her frame seemed convulsed  and violently  agitated  a torrent of tears poured down her lovely cheeks  and Elinor  conceived some hopes that her great  soul was now struggling to shake off the intolerable weight of sorrow   But the calm which succeeded was the calm of insensibility  she gazed  round her with a vacant eye  and all her nobleness of nature seemed  irrecoverably lost in senseless melancholy     The disorder of her apartment had reached the cars of Raymond  and  in  the violence of surprise and anxiety  he once again rushed into her  presence  —With all the bitterness of remorse  he viewed the majestic  ruins of exalted beauty and greatness  the fatal effect of his lawless  passions  His haughty soul melted into pity  he demanded the cause of  her disorder  and received from Elinor a distinct account of the horrid  discourse to which her unhappy Lady had been witness  All the train of  dreadful passions that attend on detected guilt  tore the heart of  Raymond with their united tortures  He started  and wildly traversed the  chamber  he paused  bent his eyes again upon the Countess  then  turning  suddenly from the afflicting object  uttered terrible execrations upon  himself and his vile seducers  He fell upon his knees  and addressing  himself to Ela  as if she were sensible of his discourse  he  passionately vowed to restore her son to her arms  and instantly to  abandon her castle —Again  rising suddenly  and issuing forth with wild  precipitation  he called loudly for Grey  who appeared before him  trembling  and  to prevent his rage  began with cursing the brutal  violence of Reginhald — Bid my Knights prepare   said Raymond   let my  retinue stand ready before the gates  —we must depart  —The countenance  of his creature expressed surprise and dissatisfaction —        No expostulation  none of thy damned arts —Where hast thou bestowed the  son of this unhappy woman  See that he be instantly conveyed back to  her castle  Do it  slave  or woe upon thy head  Haste —answer me  not —Give out my orders for departure         —Then  once more entering the chamber of the Countess  with all the  remorse and anguish of a man at length awakened to a sense of his  unjust misguided conduct  when it was now too late to be corrected or  repaired  he gazed distractedly upon her  and with a deep and dismal  groan pronounced a solemn farewell  Then  turning quickly upon Elinor   who wept by his side   Speak to her   said he       she disdains  and justly  to hold converse with
