 but to carry the war into the enemies country rather than to wait for it in his own  He entere with a large army into Saxony  and  in the usua strain of civility  demanded from the Elector a passage through that country  which he well knew the possessor of it was not able to refuse  In the mean time  he disguised all his suspicions of the Elector s having secretly treated with his enemies  and  upon the latter s proposing to observe a strict neutrality  the King of Prussia professed himself extremely pleased at the offer  but desired  as a proof of the sincerity of his intentions  to separate the army of the Electorate  for which there could possibly be no occasion  in case of the neutrality proposed  This  however  the Elector of Saxony thought it prudent to refuse  which was probably what the other eagerly desired  for  in consequence of his refusal  the King formed a kind of blockade about the Saxon camp  in order to reduce it by famine  for such was the situation of this spot  on which the Saxons had encamped  that though a small army could defend it against the most numerous forces  yet the same difficulty attended leaving it  that served to render it inaccessible to an enemy  Of this his Prussian Majesty took the advantage  and  by blocking up every place of egress  thus cut off their provisions  and the whole body was obliged to surrender prisoners of war   In a detail of the transactions of England it will not be necessary to recapitulate the numerous marches  victories  sieges  and repulses of this great foreign ally  Whatever either former history had shewn  or even romance might feign  was outdone both by his expedition and intrepidity  King only of a very small territory  assisted by England  whose situation was too remote to give any considerable succours    219 opposed and surrounded by all the most formidable powers of Europe  he still opposed them on every side  he invades Bohemia  defeats the Austrian General at Lowoschtch  retreats  begins his second campaign with another victory near Prague  is upon the point of taking that city  but by a temerity inspired by former successes  attacking the Austrians at a disadvantage near Kolin  he is defeated  and obliged to raise the siege    Fortune  says he  has turned her back upon me this day  I ought to have expected it  she is a female  and I am no gallant  success often occasions a destructive confidence  but another time we will do better      One misfortune seemed to follow another  the Hanoverians  who had joined with him and England  in the alliance  had armed in his favour  commanded by the Duke of Cumberland  As this army  which consisted of three thousand eight hundred men  was greatly out numbered by the French  they were obliged continually to retire before them  The passage of the river Weser might have been disputed with some hopes of success  yet the Hanoverians permitted them to pass it unmolested  Their army  therefore  was now driven from one part of the country to an other  till  at length  it made a stand near a village called Hastenback  where it was judged they would be best able to sustain the superiority of the enemies numbers  However  notwithstanding all the efforts of discipline  and the advantages of situation  the weaker side was still obliged to retire  and  leaving the field of battle to the French  retreated towards Stade  By taking this route they marched into a country  from whence they could neither procure provisions  nor yet had an opportunity of attacking the enemy upon equal terms  Unable  by their situation  to retire  or  by their strength  to advance  they were compelled to sign a capitulation  by which the whole army laid down   220 their arms  and were dispersed into different quarters of cantonment  By this remarkable treaty  which went by the name of the treaty of Closter Seven  the Hanoverians were quite subdued  and all the French forces let loose upon the King of Prussia   The situation of this Monarch was now become desperate  nor could human prudence foresee how he could extricate himself from his distress  The French forces  now united  invaded his dominions on one side  the Russians  who  for some time  had hovered over his dominions in another part  all at once hastened onward to overwhelm him  marking their way with slaughter and cruelty  a large body of Austrians entered Silesia  and penetrated as far as Breslau  and turning to Schweidnitz  sat down before that important fortress  which  after a long siege  surrendered  Another army of the same nation entered Lusatia  made themselves masters of Zittau  and pressing forward  laid the capital of Berlin under contribution  Twenty two thousand Swedes pierced into Prussian Pomerania  took the towns of Anclam and Demmein  and exacted tribute from the whole country  It was in vain that the King of Prussia faced about to every invader  though his enemies fled before him  while he pursued one body  another penetrated his territories in the mean time  and his dominions  even in the midst of victory  were
