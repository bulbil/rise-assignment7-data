a challenge  desiring him to meet me at a certain time and place  that I might have an opportunity of punishing his perfidy  at the expence of his blood —He accepted the invitation  and I betook myself to the field  though not without feeling considerable repugnance to the combat  which frequently attacked me in cold sweats by the way —but the desire of revenge  the shame of retracting  and hope of conquest  conspired to repel these unmanly symptoms of fear  and I appeared on the plain with a good grace  there I waited an hour beyond the time appointed  and was not ill pleased to find he had no mind to   39 meet me  because now I should have an opportunity of exposing his cowardice  displaying my own courage  and of beating him soundly wheresoever I should find him  without any dread of the consequence —Elevated with these suggestions  which entirely banished all thoughts of my deplorable condition  I went directly to Gawky s lodgings  where I was informed of his precipitate retreat  he having set out for the country in less than an hour after he had received my billet —Whereupon  I was vain enough to have the whole story inserted in the news  although I was fain to sell a gold laced hat to my landlord  for less than half price  to defray the expence  and contribute to my subsistence   CHAP  VII   I am entertained by Mr  Crab—a description of him—I acquire the art of surgery—consult Crab s disposition—become necessary to him—an accident happens—he advises me to launch out into the world—assists me with money—I set out for London   THE fumes of my resentment being dissipated  as well as the vanity of my success  I found myself deserted to all the horrors of extreme want  and avoided by mankind as a creature of a different species  or rather as a solitary being  no ways comprehended within the scheme or protection of providence  My despair   40 had rendered me almost quite stupified  when I was one day told  that a gentleman desired to see me  at a certain publick house  whither immediately I repaired  and was introduced to one Mr  Launcelot Crab a surgeon in town  who was engaged with two more  in drinking a liquor called pop in  composed by tossing a quartern of brandy into a quart of small beer —Before I relate the occasion of this message  I believe it will not be disagreeable to the reader  if I describe the gentleman who sent for me  and mention some circumstances of his character and conduct  which may illustrate what follows  and account for his behaviour to me   This member of the faculty was aged fifty  about five foot high  and ten round the belly  his face was capacious as a full moon  and much of the complexion of a mulberry  his nose resembling a powder horn  was swelled to an enormous size  and studded all over with carbuncles  and his little grey eyes reflected the rays in such an oblique manner  that while he looked a person full in the face  one would have imagined he was admiring the buckle of his shoe —He had long entertained an implacable resentment against Potion  who  tho  a younger practitioner  had engrossed more business than he  and once had the assurance to perform a cure  whereby he disappointed and disgraced the prognostic of the said Crab —This quarrel  which was at one time upon the point of being made up  by the interposition and mediation of friends  had been lately inflamed beyond a possibility of reconciliation by the respective wives of the opponents  who  chancing to meet at a christening  disagreed about precedence  proceeded from invectives to blows    41 and were with great difficulty  by the gossips  prevented from converting the occasion of joy  into a seene of blood   The difference between these rivals was in the height of rancour  when I was sent for by Crab  who received me as civilly as I could have expected from one of his disposition  and after desiring me to sit  enquired into the particulars of my leaving the house of Potion  which when I had related  he said with a malicious grin —   Here s a sneaking dog —I always thought him a fellow without a soul  d—n me —a canting scoundrel  who has crept into business by his hypocrisy  and kissing the a—se of every body  —   Ay  ay   says another  one might see with half an eye  that the rascal has no honesty in him  by his going so regulary to church    This sentence was confirmed by the third  who assured his companions  that Potion was never known to be disguised in liquor but once  at a meeting of the godly  where he had distinguished himself by an extempore prayer an hour long —After this preamble  Crab addressed himself to me in these words    Well  my lad  I have heard a good character of you  and I ll do for you —You may send your things to my house when you please —I have given orders for your reception —Z—ds  what does the booby stare at —If you have no mind to embrace my courteous offer  you may let it alone and be d—n d
