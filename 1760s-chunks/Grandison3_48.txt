named   Miss Gr  Pretty well  But  Sir  have you not seen Ladies abroad whom you like better than either of those I have named —Answer me to that   Sir Ch  I have  Charlotte  and at home too   Miss Gr  I don t know what to say to you—But  pray  Sir  Have you not seen Ladies abroad whom you have liked better than any you ever saw at home   Sir Ch  No  But tell me  Charlotte  to what does all this tend   Miss Gr  Only  brother  that we long to have you happily married  and we are afraid  that your declining this proposal and that  is owing to some previous attachment—And now all is out   Lord L  And now  my dear brother  all is out—  Lady L  If our brother will gratify our curiosity—  Had I ever before  Lucy  so great a call upon me as now  for presence of mind     118 Sir Charles sighed  He paused  And at last said—You are very generous  very kind  in your wishes to see me married  I have seen the Lady with whom  of all the women in the world  I think I could be happy   A fine blush overspread his face  and he looked down  Why  Sir Charles  did you blush  Why did you look down  The happy  thrice happy woman  was not present  was she —Ah  No  no  no —  Sir Ch  And now  Charlotte  what other questions have you to ask  before it comes to your turn to answer some that I have to put to you   Miss Gr  Only one —Is the Lady a foreign Lady   How every body but I looked at him  expecting his answer —He really hesitated  At last  I think  Charlotte  you will excuse me  if I say  that this question gives me some pain—Because it leads to another  that  if made  I cannot at present myself answer  But why so  Sir  thought I    And if not made  it cannot be of any signification to speak to this   Lord L  We would not give you pain  Sir Charles  And yet—  Sir Ch  What yet  my dear Lord L    Lord L  When I was at Florence  there was much talk—  Sir Ch  Of a Lady of that city —Olivia  my Lord —There was —She has fine qualities  but unhappily blended with others less approveable —But I have nothing to wish for from Olivia  She has done me too much honour  I should not so readily have named her now  had she been more sollicitous to conceal the distinction she honoured me with  But your Lordship  I dare hope  never heard even ill will open its mouth to her disreputation  only that she descended too much in her regard for one object   Lord L  Your character  Sir Charles  was as much to her reputation  as—  Sir Ch   interrupting   O my Lord  how brotherly  119 partial  But  this Lady out of the question  my peace has been broken in pieces by a tender fault in my constitution—And yet I would not be without it   The sweet Emily arose  and  in tears  went to the window  A sob  endeavoured to be suppressed  called our attention to her   Sir Charles went  and took her hand  Why weeps my Emily   Because you  who so well deserve to be happy  seem not to be so   Tender examples  Lucy  are catching  I had much ado to restrain my tears   He kindly consoled her  My unhappiness  my dear  said he  arises chiefly from that of other people  I should but for that be happy in myself  because I endeavour to accommodate my mind to bear inevitable evils  and to make  if possible  a virtue of necessity  But  Charlotte  see how grave you have made us all  and yet I must enter with you upon a subject that possibly may be thought as serious by you  as that which  at present  I wish to quit      Wish to quit    The question gave him some pain  because it led to another  which he cannot himself at present  answer —     What  Lucy  let me ask you  before I follow him to his next subject  can you gather from what passed in that already recited  If he is himself at an uncertainty  he may deserve to be pitied  and not blamed  But don t you think he might have answered  whether the Lady is a foreigner  or not —How could he know what the next question would have been   I had the assurance to ask Miss Grandison afterwards  aside  Whether any thing could be made out  or guessed at  by his eyes  when he spoke of having seen the woman he could prefer to all others  For he sat next me  she over against him   I know not what to make of him
