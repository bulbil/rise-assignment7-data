may have  but I believe it would be a comfort to her to see her brother in her present melancholy circumstances  I don’t know that there is any thing uncommonly melancholy in her circumstances  replied the lady  her mother’s years and infirmities made her death a thing to be looked for  I suppose your mistress is not in want  My poor ingenuous Patty said she blushed at the cruel indifference with which Lady Sarah said this  Not in immediate want  Madam  I hope  but your ladyship must needs think she is in a destitute way  with two children  and but fifty pounds a year in the world  What do you mean  woman  cried Lady Sarah  it is impossible but Lady Bidulph must have left money behind her  Sir George  I am sure  has got nothing but what she could not keep from him  Patty answered  Lady Bidulph  Madam  left no money behind her more than what was barely sufficient to defray some necessary expences that occurred immediately after her death  Well  and so your mistress  I suppose  after having behaved so ill as she has done to her brother  expects he should provide handsomely for her  and her children  Arnold’s children for the rest of their lives  I know not  Madam  returned Patty  what my Lady’s expectations are  but I believe she would be    very glad to see Sir George before she goes out of town  or at least inform him of her design  What is her design  pray  asked Lady Sarah  To retire into the country  Madam  as she has not wherewithal to subsist on in London  She can’t do better  I think  said the Lady  Where does she live now  My poor maid  who thought this question tended to the proud woman’s calling on  or at least sending to me  made haste to inform her  she lodges  Madam  at a milliner’s  at the corner of the Haymarket  the left hand as you turn—Oh dear  pray stop  you need not be so particular  I have no design of paying her a visit in her corner shop  my only reason for enquiring was  to know whether she had thought proper to keep those expensive lodgings her mother was in  in expectation of Sir George’s continuing her in them  My Lady has no such view  I believe  Madam  Well  you may tell your Lady  that if she will go out of town with her children  I will prevail on Sir George to allow her something  He will not be in town this month  so that she need not wait for his arrival  She might  if she would have been guided by her brother  have been a credit to her friends  instead of what she now is  Patty owns  she was so full of indignation  that she wished at that moment not to have been a servant  that she might have reproached her with her hard heartedness  Oh  my dear  these are the stings of poverty  It is not the hard bed  nor the homely board  but the oppressive insolence of proud prosperity  ’tis that only which can inflict a wound on the ingenuous mind   As for that mean woman  I despise her too much to suffer myself to be obliged to her  She will endeavour to prevail on my brother  If his own heart cannot prevail on him  I disclaim her influence  I know she means not to use it in my favour  on the contrary  I make no doubt but she will endeavour to irritate Sir George gainst me by misrepresentations  Her pride makes her wish to have an indigent relation out of the way  yet her avarice would not suffer her to enable me to retire  and she will make my continuing here through necessity a pretence for still with holding any assistance from me  Let it be so  I would rather submit to the most abject drudgery  than owe a wretched dependant existence to such a woman  I am sure my brother  notwithstanding his resentment  if he knew what my situation truly is  would not behave with cruelty  but my mind is not become so sordid  fallen as I am  as to turn petitioner for relief  But no more  my Cecilia  let not my fate interrupt your happiness     November 4  I have had a letter from Mrs Faulkland  filled with the overflowings of a joyful heart  She says  Mr Faulkland is so delighted with the country he is in  and finds his estate capable of such vast improvement  that he thinks of making a longer residence there than he at first intended  the rather as he has some suspicions that his agent has not acted faithfully by him  and as he is sure the extensive plan that he has now laid down  will be better executed under his own eye  He purposes building a little convenient lodge on a very charming spot in the centre of his estate  where he may reside whilst his works are carrying on  so that Mrs Faulkland promises herself much pleasure  in spending her time partly there and partly in Dublin  She has already made a large circle of acquaintance  and bestows high encomiums on the great politeness and hospitality with
