 he might be out of harm s way  Here   however  he made little progress  except in mischief  which he practised  with impunity  because the school mistress would run no risk of  disobliging a lady of fortune  by exercising unnecessary severities upon  her only child  Nevertheless  Mrs  Pickle was not so blindly partial as  to be pleased with such unseasonable indulgence  Perry was taken out of  the hands of this courteous teacher  and committed to the instruction  of a pedagogue  who was ordered to administer such correction as the boy  should in his opinion deserve  This authority he did not neglect to  use  his pupil was regularly flogged twice a day  and after having been  subjected to this course of discipline for the space of eighteen months   declared the most obstinate  dull  and untoward genius that ever had  fallen under his cultivation  instead of being reformed  he seemed  rather hardened and confirmed in his vicious inclinations  and was dead    6 22 15  3 45 PM   to all sense of fear as well as shame   His mother was extremely mortified at these symptoms of stupidity  which  she considered as an inheritance derived from the spirit of his father   and consequently insurmountable by all the efforts of human care   But the commodore rejoiced over the ruggedness of his nature  and was  particularly pleased when  upon inquiry  he found that Perry had beaten  all the boys in the school  a circumstance from which he prognosticated  everything that was fair and fortunate in his future fate  observing   that at his age he himself was just such another  The boy  who was  now turned of six  having profited so little under the birch of  his unsparing governor  Mrs  Pickle was counselled to send him to a  boarding school not far from London  which was kept by a certain person  very eminent for his successful method of education  This advice she the  more readily embraced  because at that time she found herself pretty  far gone with another child that she hoped would console her for the  disappointment she had met with in the unpromising talents of Perry   or at any rate divide her concern  so as to enable her to endure the  absence of either   CHAPTER XII    Peregrine is sent to a boarding school  Becomes remarkable for his  Genius and Ambition   The commodore  understanding her determination  to which her husband did  not venture to make the least objection  interested himself so much  in behalf of his favourite  as to fit him out at his own charge  and  accompany him in person to the place of his destination  where he  defrayed the expense of his entrance  and left him to the particular  care and inspection of the usher  who having been recommended to him  as a person of parts and integrity  received per advance a handsome  consideration for the task he undertook   Nothing could be better judged than this piece of liberality  the  assistant was actually a man of learning  probity  and good sense  and  though obliged by the scandalous administration of fortune to act in  the character of an inferior teacher  had  by his sole capacity and  application  brought the school to that degree of reputation  which  it never could have obtained from the talents of its superior  He had  established an economy  which  though regular  was not at all severe   by enacting a body of laws suited to the age and comprehension of every  individual  and each transgressor was fairly tried by his peers  and  punished according to the verdict of the jury  No boy was scourged for  want of apprehension  but a spirit of emulation was raised by well timed  praise and artful comparison  and maintained by a distribution of small  prizes  which were adjudged to those who signalized themselves either by  their industry  sobriety  or genius   This tutor  whose name was Jennings  began with Perry  according to his  constant maxim  by examining the soil  that is  studying his temper   in order to consult the bias of his disposition  which was strangely    6 22 15  3 45 PM   perverted by the absurd discipline he had undergone  He found him in a  state of sullen insensibility  which the child had gradually contracted  in a long course of stupefying correction  and at first he was not in  the least actuated by that commendation which animated the rest of  his school fellows  nor was it in the power of reproach to excite his  ambition  which had been buried  as it were  in the grave of disgrace   the usher  therefore  had recourse to contemptuous neglect  with  which he affected to treat this stubborn spirit  foreseeing that if he  retained any seeds of sentiment  this weather would infallibly raise  them into vegetation  his judgment was justified by the event  the boy  in a little time began to make observations  he perceived the marks  of distinction with which virtue was rewarded  grew ashamed of the
