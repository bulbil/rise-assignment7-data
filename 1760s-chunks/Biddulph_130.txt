more than supply my family  then I have the best poultry in the country  and my garden flourishes like Eden  Mr Arnold is such a sportsman that we have more game than we know what to do with  but his chief pleasure is hunting   Your little namesake promises to be the greatest beauty in the county  Dolly  who is a pretty little cherry cheek  and her father’s great favourite  prates like a parrot  How delightful will be the task of expanding and forming the minds of these two cherubs  how joyfully    and how thankfully do I look back on the troubled sea which I have passed  My voyage indeed was not long  but my sufferings were great while they lasted  I never  since I was married  enjoyed life till now  You know my match was originally the result of duty to the best of mothers  and though  if I ever knew my own heart  it was absolutely freed from all attachment to any other person  yet was it not so devoted to Mr Arnold  as to have made him my choice preferably to all other men  if I had not resolved in this  as in every other action of my life  to be determined by those to whom I owed obedience  When I married Mr Arnold  I esteemed him  a sufficient foundation  in the person of a husband  whereon to build love  That love  his kindness  and my own gratitude  in a little produced in my heart  and I will venture to say few wives loved so well  none better  You know I could never bear to consider love as a childish divinity  who exercises his power by throwing the heart into tumultuous raptures  my love  tho’ of a more temperate kind  was sufficiently fervent to make Mr Arnold’s coldness towards me alone capable of wounding my heart most sensibly  but when this coldness was aggravated by the cruel distrust which he was taught to entertain of me  the blow indeed became scarce supportable  and I did not till then know the progress he had made in my affections   Sorrows  my Cecilia  soften and subdue the mind prodigiously  and I think my heart was better prepared from its sufferings to receive Mr Arnold’s returning tenderness  than an age of courtship in the gay and prosperous days of life could have framed it to  I exult in his restored affections  and love him a thousand times better than ever I did  He deserves it  I am sure he does  he was led away from me by enchantment  nothing else could have done it  But the charm is broke  thank heaven  and I find him now the tenderest  the best of men  Every look  every word  every action of his life  is expressive of a love next to adoration  Oh  I should be too happy  if the blessings I now possess were to be my continued portion in this life  There is  however  but one about which I can rationally indulge any fears—My mother—Her years  and her growing infirmities  will not suffer me to hope for her being long absent from her final place of felicity  You always used to say I anticipated misfortunes  this event may be farther off than my anxious fears sometimes suggest to me  so no more of it   March 10  My good Lady V—— writes me word  that all our business is finished     The whole amount of our effects came but to three thousand four hundred pounds  our debts  including some charges which have occurred in the transacting of our affairs  exceeded eight thousand  Our worthy Lord V—— has paid the whole  and has made himself our only creditor  We have nothing now  that we can call our own  but my jointure  I do not reckon upon my mother’s bounty to us  our income from her  and the house we live in  will be Sir George’s  whenever it is our misfortune to lose her  But she tells me she is well  and talks of coming down in about a fortnight   March 11  I am here in a scene of still life  my dear  and you must now expect to hear of nothing but such trivial matters as used to be the subject of our journals when we were both girls  and you lived within a bow shot of Sidney Castle  and saw me every day  The last three months of my life have glided away like a smooth stream  when there is not a breath of wind to ruffle it  and after you read the transactions of one day  you know how I pass all the rest   I have told you of every body that came to see me  and all the visits that I returned  I have given you an account of all our old acquaintance  and of some new ones  You know what my amusements are  and what my business  Indeed  what I call business  is my chief pleasure  You  who are surrounded by the gaieties of a splendid court  had need of the partiality which I know you have for your Sidney  to desire a continuation of her insipid narrative  But  I suppose  if I were to tell you  that  on such
