Every day almost presented to his view such lamentable scenes  as were most likely to attract his notice  and engage his benevolence   Reverses of fortune  attended with the most deplorable circumstances of  domestic woe  were continually intruding upon his acquaintance  his ears  were invaded with the cries of the hapless wife  who  from the enjoyment  of affluence and pleasure  was forced to follow her husband to this  abode of wretchedness and want  his eyes were every minute assailed  with the naked and meagre appearances of hunger and cold  and his fancy  teemed with a thousand aggravations of their misery     6 22 15  3 45 PM   Thus situated  his purse was never shut while his heart remained open   Without reflecting upon the slenderness of his store  he exercised his  charity to all the children of distress  and acquired a popularity   which  though pleasing  was far from being profitable  In short  his  bounty kept no pace with his circumstances  and in a little time he was  utterly exhausted  He had recourse to his bookseller  from whom  with  great difficulty  he obtained a small reinforcement  and immediately  relapsed into the same want of retention  He was conscious of his  infirmity  and found it incurable  he foresaw that by his own industry  he should never be able to defray the expense of these occasions  and  this reflection sunk deep into his mind  The approbation of the public   which he had earned or might acquire like a cordial often repeated   began to lose its effect upon his imagination  his health suffered by  his sedentary life and austere application  his eyesight failed  his  appetite forsook him  his spirits decayed  so that he became melancholy   listless  and altogether incapable of prosecuting the only means he had  left for his subsistence  and  what did not at all contribute to the  alleviation of these particulars  he was given to understand by his  lawyer  that he had lost his cause  and was condemned in costs  Even  this was not the most mortifying piece of intelligence he received   he at the same time learned that his bookseller was bankrupt  and his  friend Crabtree at the point of death   These were comfortable considerations to a youth of Peregrine s  disposition  which was so capricious  that the more his misery  increased  the more haughty and inflexible he became  Rather than be  beholden to Hatchway  who still hovered about the gate  eager for an  opportunity to assist him  he chose to undergo the want of almost every  convenience of life  and actually pledged his wearing apparel to an  Irish pawnbroker in the Fleet  for money to purchase those things   without which he must have absolutely perished  He was gradually  irritated by his misfortunes into a rancorous resentment against mankind  in general  and his heart so alienated from the enjoyments of life  that  he did not care how soon he quitted his miserable existence  Though he  had shocking examples of the vicissitudes of fortune continually before  his eyes  he could never be reconciled to the idea of living like his  fellow sufferers  in the most abject degree of dependence  If he refused  to accept of favours from his own allies and intimate friends  whom he  had formerly obliged  it is not to be supposed that he would listen to  proposals of that kind from any of his fellow prisoners  with whom he  had contracted acquaintance  he was even more cautious than ever of  incurring obligations  he now shunned his former messmates  in order to  avoid disagreeable tenders of friendship  Imagining that he perceived  an inclination in the clergyman to learn the state of his finances  he  discouraged and declined the explanation  and at length secluded himself  from all society   CHAPTER CI    He receives an unexpected Visit  and the Clouds of Misfortune begin to  separate     6 22 15  3 45 PM   While he pined in this forlorn condition  with an equal abhorrence of  the world and himself  Captain Gauntlet arrived in town in order to  employ his interest for promotion in the army  and in consequence of his  wife s particular desire  made it his business to inquire for Peregrine   to whom he longed to be reconciled  even though at the expense of a  slight submission  But he could hear no tidings of him  at the place to  which he was directed  and  on the supposition that our hero had gone  to reside in the country  applied himself to his own business   with intention to renew his inquiries  after that affair should be  transacted  He communicated his demands to his supposed patron  who had  assumed the merit of making him a captain  and been gratified with a  valuable present on that consideration  and was cajoled with hopes of  succeeding in his present aim by the same interest   Meanwhile  he became acquainted with one of the clerks belonging to  the War Office  whose advice and assistance  he was told  would be a  furtherance
