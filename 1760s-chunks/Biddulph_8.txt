so very unexceptionable in his behaviour  If his morals answered to his outward deportment—there she stopped  or rather Sir George interrupted her  I hope you’ll believe madam  that my knowlege of mankind is not so circumscribed  but that I can distinguish between a real and an assumed character  and I will venture to assert  that  in the whole circle of my acquaintance  I do not know one so unobjectionable  even in your strict sense of the word morals  as Mr Faulkland   Well  said my mother  I have the pleasure to observe to you  and I think I am seldom mistaken in my judgment   that Mr Faulkland is at least as well pleased with Sidney as we are with him—What say you daughter  Ay  what say you sister  cry’d Sir George—I think madam  that Mr Faulkland is an accomplished gentleman  and—‘and that you could be content to look no farther  if matters are brought to bear  eh  Sidney ’  I need not tell you whose speech this was —Brother  that is going a little too far  for the first time of my seeing him  A great deal too far  my mother said  let us first know Mr Faulkland’s mind from himself  before we say a word more of the matter   Sir George told us  that Mr Faulkland  at going away  had requested he would sup with him at his own house  as he said he had a few visits of form to pay  and should be at home early in the evening   May 24  My mother and I were in bed before my brother came in last night  though he keeps very good hours in general  When we met this morning at breakfast  I saw by Sir George’s face that he was brimful of something—Faulkland don’t like you  Sidney  said he  abruptly—How can you or I help that  brother  cry’d I  colouring  tho’  to tell you the truth  I did not believe him  for I knew  if it had been so  he would not have come out with it so bluntly  But my mother  who always takes every word she hears literally  took him up very short  ‘If he does not  Sir  it is not polite in you to tell your sister so  I hope    Sidney may be liked by as good a man as Mr Faulkland ’ and up she tossed her dear honest head  Sir George burst out a laughing  My mother looked angry  she was afraid her sagacity would be call’d in question  after what she had pronounced the evening before  I looked silly  but pretended to smile  Sir George was clown enough to laugh on  at last  to my mother  ‘But my dear madam  can you believe me serious in what I said  have you so good an opinion of my veracity  or so ill a one of my breeding  as to suppose I would shock my sister by such a rude declaration  if I meant any thing by it but a joke ’ Indeed  Sidney   looking half smiling to me  I would not be as much in love with our sovereign lady the queen  as poor Faulkland is with you  for my whole estate   This put me a great deal more out of countenance than what he had said at first  Nay  brother  now you are too extravagant the other way—My mother looked surprized  but recovered her good humour presently—Dear George  there is no knowing when you are in earnest and when not  but  as Sidney says  now you are rather too extravagant  You might say so to Faulkland  answered my brother  if you were to hear him  I could get nothing from him the whole night but your praises  I thought  said my pleased mother  he had not disliked the girl—Now you see  son  her silence did her no harm  and she smiled tenderly at me  Come  said Sir George  things are mighty well on all sides  Faulkland has begged of me  that I would use my interest with you  mother  whom he thinks one of the best of women   that he may be permitted in form to make his addresses to Miss Bidulph  My interest he knows he has  and I hope  madam  it will have your approbation—He desired me to explain minutely to you every circumstance of his fortune  what his estate is I have told you  and his family is of known distinction  He begged I would not mention Sidney’s fortune  and said  that if  upon a farther acquaintance  he should have the happiness to be acceptable to my sister  he should insist upon leaving the appointment of her settlement to lady Bidulph and myself  I told him I would lay this proposal before you  and could for his present comfort inform him  that  as I believed my sister had no prepossessions in favour of any one else  I was sure  if he met with your concurrence  her’s would follow of course   A very discreet answer  said my mother  just such a one as I would have dictated to you  if I had been at your elbow  I believe we may venture to suppose  that Mrs Sidney has
