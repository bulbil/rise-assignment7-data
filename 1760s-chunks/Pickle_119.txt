of cruelty and oppression  because in all nations the genius  of the people must be consulted by their governors  and the burthen  proportioned to the shoulders on which it is laid   Else  what follows    said the physician   The consequence is plain   replied the governor    insurrection  revolt  and his own destruction  for it is not to  be supposed that the subjects of any nation would be so abject and  pusillanimous as to neglect the means which heaven hath put in their  power for their own preservation     Gadzooks  you re in the right  sir    cried Pallet   that  I grant you  must be confessed  doctor  I m afraid  we have got into the wrong box   This son of Paean  however  far from  being of his friend s opinion  observed  with an air of triumph  that  he would not only demonstrate the sophistry of the gentleman s last  allegation by argument and facts  but even confute him with his own  words  Jolter s eyes kindling at this presumptuous declaration  he told  his antagonist  while his lip quivered with resentment  that if his  arguments were no better than his breeding  he was sure he would make  very few converts to his opinion  and the doctor  with all the insolence  of triumph  advised him to beware of disputes for the future  until he  should have made himself more master of his subject   Peregrine both wished and hoped to see the disputants proceed to  arguments of more weight and conviction  and the painter  dreading the  same issue  interposed with the usual exclamation of  For God s sake   gentlemen   when the governor rose from table in great dudgeon  and left  the room  muttering some ejaculation  of which the word coxcomb only  could be distinctly heard  The physician  being thus left master of the  field of battle  was complimented on his victory by Peregrine  and so    6 22 15  3 45 PM   elevated by his success  that he declaimed a full hour on the  absurdity of Jolter s proposition  and the beauty of the democratic  administration  canvassed the whole scheme of Plato s republic  with  many quotations from that ideal author  touching the to kalon  from  thence he made a transition to the moral sense of Shaftesbury  and  concluded his harangue with the greatest part of that frothy writer s  rhapsody  which he repeated with all the violence of enthusiastic  agitation  to the unspeakable satisfaction of his entertainer  and  the unutterable admiration of Pallet  who looked upon him as something  supernatural and divine   So intoxicated was this vain young man with the ironical praises of  Pickle  that he forthwith shook off all reserve  and having professed  a friendship for our hero  whose taste and learning he did not fail to  extol  intimated in plain terms  that he was the only person  in these  latter ages  who possessed that genius  that portion of the divinity   or Ti Theion  which immortalized the Grecian poets  that as Pythagoras  affirmed the spirit of Euphorbus had transmigrated into his body  he   the doctor  strangely possessed with the opinion that he himself was  inspired by the soul of Pindar  because  making allowance for the  difference of languages in which they wrote  there was a surprising  affinity between his own works and those of that celebrated Theban  and  as a confirmation of this truth  he immediately produced a sample of  each  which  though in spirit and versification as different as the Odes  of Horace and our present poet laureat  Peregrine did not scruple to  pronounce altogether congenial  notwithstanding the violence he by  this sentence offered to his own conscience  and a certain alarm to  his pride  that was weak enough to be disturbed by the physician s  ridiculous vanity and presumption  which  not contented with displaying  his importance in the world of taste and polite literature  manifested  itself in arrogating certain material discoveries in the province of  physic  which could not fail to advance him to the highest pinnacle of  that profession  considering the recommendation of his other talents   together with a liberal fortune which he inherited from his father   CHAPTER XLIV   The Doctor prepares an Entertainment in the Manner of the Ancients   which is attended with divers ridiculous Circumstances   In a word  our young gentleman  by his insinuating behaviour  acquired  the full confidence of the doctor  who invited him to an entertainment   which he intended to prepare in the manner of the ancients  Pickle   struck with this idea  eagerly embraced the proposal  which he honoured  with many encomiums  as a plan in all respects worthy of his genius and  apprehension  and the day was appointed at some distance of time   that the treater might have leisure to compose certain pickles and  confections which were not to be found among the culinary preparations  of these degenerate days  With a view of rendering the physician s taste  more conspicuous
