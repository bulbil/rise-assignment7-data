she might be a widow  But she looked so young  that I scarcely knew what to think of it   If I was all impatient to get at her history  she was not less so to know who I was  She besought me to acquaint her with my name  not doubting  as she kindly expressed it  by my noble air  and still more by the generous pity which had made me enter so warmly into her interests  that I belonged to some considerable family  The question was not a little perplexing  My colour came and went  my agitation was extreme  and I must own that  with less repugnance to the meanness of a falsehood than to the acknowledgment of a disgraceful truth  I answered that I was the son of Baron Steinbach  an officer of the German guard  Tell me  likewise  resumed the lady  why you left Madrid  Before you answer my question  I will insure you all my father s credit  as well as that of my brother Don Gaspard  It is the least mark of gratitude I can bestow on a gentleman who  for my service  has neglected the preservation even of his own life  Without further hesitation  I acquainted her with all the circumstances of my rencounter  she laid the whole blame on my deceased antagonist  and engaged to interest all her family in my favour   When I had satisfied her curiosity  it seemed not unreasonable to plead in favour of my own  I inquired whether she was maid  wife  or widow  It is three years  answered she  since my father made me marry Don Diego de Lara  and I have been a widow these fifteen months  Madam  said I  by what misfortune were your wedded joys so soon interrupted  I am going to inform you  sir  resumed the lady  in return for the confidence you have reposed in me   Don Diego de Lara was a very elegant and accomplished gentleman  but  though his affection for me was extreme  and every day was witness to some attempt at giving me pleasure  such as the most impassioned and most tender lover puts in practice to win the smile of her he loves  though he had a thousand estimable qualities  my heart was untouched by all his merit  Love is not always the offspring either of assiduity or desert  Alas  we are often captivated at first sight by we know not whom  nor why  nor how  To love  then  was not in my power  More disconcerted than gratified by his repeated offices of tenderness  which I received with a forced courtesy  but without real plea ure  if I accused myself in secret of ingratitude  I still thought myself an object as much of pity as of censure  To his unhappiness and my own  his delicacy more than kept pace with his affection  Not an action or a speech of mine  but he unravelled all its hidden motives  and fathomed all my thoughts  almost before they arose  The inmost recesses of my heart were laid open to his penetration  He complained without ceasing of my indifference  and esteemed himself only so much the more unfortunate  in not being able to please me  as he was well assured that no rival stood in his way  for I was scarcely sixteen years old  and  before he paid his addresses to me  he had tampered with my women  who had assured him that no one had hitherto attracted my attention  Yes  Seraphina  he would often say  I could have been contented that you had preferred some other to myself  and that there were no more fatal cause of your insensibility  My attentions and your own principles would get the better of such a juvenile prepossession  but I despair of triumphing over your coldness  since your heart is impenetrable to all the love I have lavished on you  Wearied with the repetition of the same strain  I told him that instead of disturbing his repose and mine by this excess of delicacy  he would do better in trusting to the effects of time  In fact  at my age  I could not be expected to enter into the refinements of so sentimental a passion  and Don Diego should have waited  as I warned him  for a riper period and more staid reflection  But  finding that a whole year had elapsed  and that he was no forwarder in my favour than on the first day  he lost all patience  or rather  his brain became distracted  Affecting to have important business at court  he took his leave  and went to serve as a volunteer in the Low Countries  where he soon found in the chances of war what he went to seek  the terminations of his sufferings and of his life   After the lady had finished her recital  her husband s uncommon character became the topic of our discourse  We were interrupted by the arrival of a courier  charged with a letter for Seraphina from the Count De Polan  She begged my permission to read it  and as she went on  I observed her to grow pale  and to become dreadfully agitated  When she had finished  she raised her eyes upward  heaved a long sigh  and her face was in a
