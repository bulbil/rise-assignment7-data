national ferocity  for which the French make large  allowances  set them all at liberty  after having gently rebuked them  for the irregularity and insolence of their conduct  so that all our  hero acquired by his gallantry and courage  was a number of scandalous  marks upon his visage that confined him a whole week to his chamber   It was impossible to conceal this disaster from Mr  Jolter  who  having  obtained intelligence of the particulars  did not fail to remonstrate  against the rashness of the adventure  which  he observed  must have  been fatal to them  had their enemies been other than Frenchmen  who     6 22 15  3 45 PM   of all people under the sun  most rigorously observe the laws of  hospitality   As the governor s acquaintance lay chiefly among Irish and English  priests  and a set of low people who live by making themselves necessary  to strangers  either in teaching the French language  or executing small  commissions with which they are intrusted  he was not the most proper  person in the world for regulating the taste of a young gentleman who  travelled for improvement  in expectation of making a figure one day  in his own country  Being conscious of his own incapacity  he contented  himself with the office of a steward  and kept a faithful account of all  the money that was disbursed in the course of their family expense  not  but that he was acquainted with all the places which were visited by  strangers on their first arrival at Paris  and he knew to a liard what  was commonly given to the Swiss of each remarkable hotel  though  with  respect to the curious painting and statuary that everywhere abounded in  that metropolis  he was more ignorant than the domestic that attends for  a livre a day   In short  Mr  Jolter could give a very good account of the stages on the  road  and save the expense of Antonini s detail of the curiosities  in Paris  he was a connoisseur in ordinaries  from twelve to  five and thirty livres  knew all the rates of fiacre and remise  could  dispute with a tailleur or a traiteur upon the articles of his bill   and scold the servants in tolerable French  But the laws  customs   and genius of the people  the characters of individuals  and scenes  of polished life  were subjects which he had neither opportunities to  observe  inclination to consider  nor discernment to distinguish  All  his maxims were the suggestions of pedantry and prejudice  so that his  perception was obscured  his judgment biased  his address awkward   and his conversation absurd and unentertaining  yet such as I have  represented this tutor  are the greatest part of those animals who  lead raw boys about the world  under the denomination of travelling  governors  Peregrine  therefore  being perfectly well acquainted with  the extent of Mr  Jolter s abilities  never dreamt of consulting him  in the disposition of his conduct  but parcelled out his time to the  dictates of his own reflection  and the information and direction of his  companions  who had lived longer in France  and consequently were better  acquainted with the pleasures of the place   As soon as he was in a condition to appear a la Francaise  he hired a  genteel chariot by the month  made the tour of the Luxembourg gallery   Palais Royal  all the remarkable hotels  churches  and celebrated places  in Paris  visited St  Cloud  Marli  Versailles  Trianon  St  Germaine   and Fountainebleau  enjoyed the opera  Italian and French comedy  and  seldom failed of appearing in the public walks  in hopes of meeting with  Mrs  Hornbeck  or some adventure suited to his romantic disposition   He never doubted that his person would attract the notice of some  distinguished inamorata  and was vain enough to believe that few female  hearts were able to resist the artillery of his accomplishments  should  he once find an opportunity of planting it to advantage  He presented  himself  however  at all the spectacles for many weeks  without reaping  the fruits of his expectation  and began to entertain a very indifferent  idea of the French discernment  which had overlooked him so long   when one day  in his way to the opera  his chariot was stopped by an  embarrass in the street  occasioned by two peasants  who having driven  their carts against each other  quarrelled  and went to loggerheads on    6 22 15  3 45 PM   the spot  Such a rencounter is so uncommon in France  that the people  shut up their shops  and from their windows threw cold water upon the  combatants  with a view of putting an end to the battle  which was  maintained with great fury  and very little skill  until one of them  receiving an accidental fall  the other took the advantage of this  misfortune  and  fastening upon him  as he lay  began to thump the  pavement with his head   Our hero s equipage
