hour after he entered his chamber   As his wife had been very obnoxious to the family  there was little notice taken of her by them  more than what common forms require  She seemed as indifferent about the death of her husband  as she had been towards him in his life time  and did not then hint a word of this reconciliation between them  or of her having had an interview with him  I am told  she is a very weak  as well as a very loose woman  and Mr Arnold thinks she has got into the hands of some designing person  However that matter may be  it is a serious affair  and he designs to take the opinion of an eminent lawyer upon it  My poor dear mother is frightned sadly  If this child should make its appearance in the world time enough to prove the possibility of its being the offspring of the late Mr Arnold  she says  it must be considered by the law as his heir  notwithstanding the husband and wife lived apart  Mr Arnold laughs  or affects to laugh at this  we    shall  however  wait with patience till the lady is brought to bed   November 25  Our house is intirely fitted up  and we shall remove into it this evening  my mother chuses to continue in her own  though Mr Arnold presses her to accept of an apartment in ours  but we shall be near neighbours  and she does not like to change   We have received the opinion of our lawyers  who tell us  that in case the child should be born within such a period of time  as to give colour to its claim  yet the lady must prove her assertion  in regard to the pretended meeting between her and her husband  which it is imagined is not in her power to do  and her indifferent character  together with several favourable circumstances which Mr Arnold has on his side  makes them quite sanguin in their expectations of overturning her claim  We are  however  likely to be engaged in a disagreeable law suit  but as Mr Arnold seems perfectly easy about the issue of it  I will make myself so too   December 10  I am more and more reconciled to my lot  my dear Cecilia  every day that I live  Mr Arnold’s assiduity and tenderness towards me deserve the gratefullest return my heart can make him  and I am convinced it is not necessary to be passionately in love with the man we marry  to make us happy  Constancy  good sense  and a sweet temper  must form a basis for a durable felicity  The two latter I am sure Mr Arnold possesses  Oh  may I never experience his want of the former  I hope my own conduct will for ever ensure to me his love  That only can secure the tranquility of my future days   December 11  My brother arrived in town last night  and came this morning in company with my mother  and I am sure at her request  to make us a formal visit  My kind Mr Arnold received him with tenderness  Sir George was coldly polite  He owned  however  to my mother  upon her asking him his opinion of his brother in law  that he seemed to be a good clever sort of a fellow  I wish I could cultivate a friendship between them  it will not be Mr Arnold’s fault if there is not  but Sir George  you know  is not of a very pliant disposition   He asked my mother  when they were alone  Whether she had yet seen Miss B or Mrs Jefferis  for he knew her by no other name  and    what she had to say for herself  My mother told him  he had better not touch upon that string  I will be hanged  replied Sir George  if the artful young baggage has not imposed upon you  My mother  who is always angry at having her sagacity called in question  told Sir George he was rude  and she should give him no satisfaction on that head  My brother answered  as it was now of no consequence  what the wench affirmed or denied  he had no farther curiosity about her  My mother called him a bear  and so the enquiry ended   December 20  I congratulate you  my sister  my friend  my ever beloved Cecilia  Happy  happy may you be in your nuptials  but in the midst of my joy for your being so nobly and worthily bestowed  self love forces a sigh from me  I have lost the pleasing hope of seeing you  at the time fixed for your return  The station your husband holds at the court of Vienna  will  I fear  long detain my beloved in a foreign land  But you are not amongst strangers  a husband  a brother  and tender parent  must make every part of the globe equally your home  I will therefore seek for my contentment in your’s  and rest satisfied with believing that you will always continue to love me   January 10  1703 4  I begin to find my thoughts so dissipated  that I am angry with myself  Mr Arnold’s excessive indulgence will spoil me
