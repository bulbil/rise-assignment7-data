two armies drew up in battle array  early in the morning  near the castle of Agincourt  A narrow ground  flanked on one side by a wood  on the other by a rivulet  was to be the scene of action  The Constable of France commanded the French  and Henry  with Edward  Duke of York  the English  both armies  for some time  kept silently gazing at each other  as if afraid to begin  which Henry perceiving  with a chearful countenance cried out  My friends  since they will not begin  let us set them the example  come on  and the blessed Trinity be our protection  and now the whole army set forward with a shout  The French still continued to wait their approach with intrepidity  when the English archers let fly a shower of arrows  three feet long  which did great execution  the French cavalry  advancing to repel these two hundred bow men  who lay till then concealed  rising on a sudden  let fly among them  the English  seeing their confusion  now threw by their arrows  and sell upon them sword in hand  tho  feeble by disease  yet they recompensed the defect   165 by valour  The French at first repulsed the assailants  but they  resolving to conquer or die  again burst in upon the enemy  with such impetuosity  that they gave way  in the mean time  a body of English horse  which had been concealed in a neighbouring wood  rushing out  flanked the French infantry  and now a total disorder began to ensue   The first line of the enemy being thus routed  the second line began to march up to interrupt the progress of victory  Henry  therefore  alighting from his horse  presented himself to the enemy  with an undaunted countenance  and  at the head of his men  fought on foot  encouraging some  and assisting others  Eighteen French cavaliers  who were resolved to kill him or to die in the attempt  rushing forth together  advanced  and one of them stunned him with a blow of his battle ax  they then fell upon him in a body  and he was just going to sink under their blows  when David Gam  a valiant Welchman  and two more of the same country  came to his aid  they soon turned the attention of the French from the King  but  being over powered themselves  they fell dead at his feet  The King had now recovered his senses  and  more help coming in  the eighteen Frenchmen were all slain  upon which he knighted the brave Welchmen  who had valiantly fallen in his defence  The heat of the battle still encreasing  his courage seemed to encrease  and  now  the thickest of the battle was gathered round his person  his brother  being fallen down by his side  stunned with the blow of a club  he covered him for a while  but  receiving another blow himself  it threw him on his knees  he soon  however  recovered    166 and his valour seemed to inspire his troops with fury  they ran headlong upon the enemy  and  by an unexpected attack  put them into such disorder  that their leaders could never after bring them to the charge  The Duke of Alencon  who commanded the second line  seeing it fly  resolved  by one desperate step  to retrieve the day  or fall in the attempt  wherefore  running up to King Henry  and crying aloud that he was the Duke of Alencon  he discharged such a blow on his head  that it carried off a part of the King s helmet  Henry  not having been able to ward off the blow  soon returned it  by striking the Duke to the ground  and he was soon killed by the surrounding crowd  all the King s efforts to save him from their fury being ineffectual   The two first lines being thus dispersed  the third refused to assist them  and marched off without fighting  The King  therefore  thinking himself thus sure of victory  was surprized with an account that his baggage was plundering by the enemy  just struck with an apprehension that the French had rallied  and being sensible that the number of his prisoners was greater than that of his army  he rashly ordered all the prisoners to be put to death  which order was accordingly executed  This severity tarnished the glory which his victory would otherwise have acquired  but all the heroism  and all the virtues of that age  are tinctured with barbarity   This victory  however great it may appear  was rather ostentatious than useful  it acquired the English glory  but not dominion  and while it settled Henry s interest more firmly in the hearts of his subjects  it only served to inspire him with a love of new conquests  With this view  therefore  he   167 returned to England  in order to procure new stores of men and money   The war between the two kingdoms  from this period  seemed to be carried on rather by negotiations  treasons  plots  and fomented jealousies  than by the force of arms  France was but as one vast theatre of crimes
