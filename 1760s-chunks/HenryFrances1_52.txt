another extremely well  or we must be a Couple of the proudest and most obstinate Mortals  that ever yet existed  I sincerely hope that our mutual Perseverance is owing to the first Cause  as it is most for the Honour of human Nature in general  and of us two in particular   I am sincerely grateful for the kind Assurance you give me of still increasing Love  If every Thought  Word  or Action of my Life  being devoted to you  and you only  can merit a Con tinuance of your Regard  I may venture to promise  that it will last for Life  and   that our Loves and Comforts will increase  even as our Days do grow       178As to that Part of my Conduct  which you say perplexes you  it is mighty easily accounted for  I have  perhaps  more Romance in my Disposition  than any Woman  you may have met with  for this Reason  my Mind is ever filled with Ideas out of the common Road  Whims  which have any Degree of Tenderness  or Delicacy  please me extremely  and I am apt to indulge them  perhaps  too much  but  when any Circumstance recalls the Remembrance of my Situation in Life  I am immediately sorry for having given Way to my Folly  and would retrieve it  if I could  But  not to appear more variable than I really am  I submit the Being  or Annihilation of Paraclete  intirely to you  If you seriously think  that my Aunt s Living there will add to your Happiness  and not hurt my Fame  I will again  with Transport  indulge my Heart with   Those Scenes of Bliss my raptur d Fancy fram d   In that dear Spot with Peace and thee retir d   Tho  Reason then my sanguine Fondness blam d   I ll still adhere to what my Love inspir d —    I insist on your answering me like the Man of Honour  and the Friend  The Lover must not have the smallest Part in your Reply   I do indeed rejoice with you  and for you  on Account of the Weather  I never see a   179 Gleam of Sunshine  or a clear Sky  that does not afford me a double Pleasure  by reflecting  how much you enjoy it  I would recommend it to you  to stay in the Country  while the Weather holds good  assured of this  that  when Sol withdraws his Influence  and refuses longer to chear us miserable Mortals  you can more than supply his Absence  by clearing those Glooms  which even his chearful Rays cannot dispel without you   I have such a violent Pain in my right Shoulder  that it is with the utmost Difficulty I move my Hand to write  I am still une pauvre Solitaire  Kitty has not yet left Bond Street  nor do I know when she will   If I were able  I would write another Letter  and not send this  for it is indeed a miserable Scrawl  tho   as my Letters have been always Originals  not Copies  I think it would be ill timed to begin with Forms  when I should leave them off   As to the Affair of Nancy and Sally  it is of no farther Consequence to me  than if James and the Coachman had been the Disputants  Nor did I mention my Opinion of Sally with any Design  for you may easily conceive  that it is a Matter of Indifference to me  whether your present Favourite was christened Sarah  or Anne  —for  while I am in Possession of the Jewel that is lodged within  I care not who holds the Casket     180  Oh  free  for ever  be his Eye   Whose Heart to me is always true   I have quotted these Lines to you before  upon some such Occasion   Adieu  my dear Harry  and believe me  as I am  faithfully and affectionately   Your s   LETTER C  HENRY to FRANCES   YOU have distinguished very justly about the Disadvantages  under which my Friendship and your Love have hitherto appeared to each other  but they have both approved themselves of the best and most lasting Kind  upon the Tests I have often mentioned to you  that I should always preserve the same constant  Tenor in my Behaviour toward you  behaved you to me  well  or ill    True as the Dial to the Sun   Altho  it be not shin d upon   and that  if you once truly loved me  whatever might happen in the Course of our Lives  might  perhaps  interrupt  but could never break the Chain  Yet  to say the Truth  these convertible or reciprocal Terms of Love and Friendship have been so often commuted  converted  and compounded between us  that they are now   181 become  according to a Latin Sentence  I have  unde nescio  met with   Utrum horum mavis accipe  sive utrumque   and between us two have come to so near a Resemblance to each other  that my Friendship  from a constant unallayed Heat  begins
