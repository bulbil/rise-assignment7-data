hearing her observe in conversation  that  she had never been at a masquerade  begged leave to attend her to the  next ball  at the same time extending his invitation to the young lady  in whose company he had found her at the play  she being present when  this subject of discourse was introduced  He had flattered himself   that this gentlewoman would decline the proposal  as she was a person  seemingly of a demure disposition  who had been born and bred in the  city  where such diversions are looked upon as scenes of lewdness and  debauchery  For once  however  he reckoned without his host  curiosity  is as prevalent in the city as at the court end of the town  Emilia no  sooner signified her assent to his proposal  than her friend  with an  air of satisfaction  agreed to make one of the party  and he was obliged  to thank her for that complaisance  which laid him under infinite  mortification  He set his genius at work to invent some scheme for  preventing her unseasonable intrusion  Had an opportunity offered  he  would have acted as her physician  and administered a medicine that  would have laid her under the necessity of staying at home  But his  acquaintance with her being too slight to furnish him with the means of  executing this expedient  he devised another  which was practised with  all imaginable success  Understanding that her grandmother had left her  a sum of money independent of her parents  he conveyed a letter to  her mother  intimating  that her daughter  on pretence of going to the  masquerade  intended to bestow herself in marriage to a certain person   and that in a few days she would be informed of the circumstances of  the whole intrigue  provided she would keep this information secret   and contrive some excuse for detaining the young lady at home  without  giving her cause to believe she was apprised of her intention  This  billet  subscribed  Your well wisher  and unknown humble servant    had the desired effect upon the careful matron  who  on the ball day   feigned herself so extremely ill  that Miss could not with any decency  quit her mamma s apartment  and therefore sent her apology to Emilia in  the afternoon  immediately after the arrival of Peregrine  who pretended  to be very much afflicted with the disappointment  while his heart  throbbed with a transport of joy   About ten o clock the lovers set out for the Haymarket  he being dressed  in the habit of Pantaloon  and she in that of Columbine  and they had  scarce entered the house when the music struck up  the curtain was  withdrawn  and the whole scene displayed at once  to the admiration of  Emilia  whose expectation was infinitely surpassed by this exhibition   Our gallant having conducted her through all the different apartments   and described the economy of the place  led her into the circle  and  in  their turn  they danced several minuets  then going to the sideboard   he prevailed upon her to eat some sweetmeats and drink a glass of  champagne  After a second review of the company  they engaged in country  dances  at which exercise they continued until our adventurer concluded  that his partner s blood was sufficiently warm for the prosecution of  his design  On this supposition  which was built upon her declaring  that she was thirsty and fatigued  he persuaded her to take a little  refreshment and repose  and  for that purpose  handed her downstairs  into the eating room  where  having seated her on the floor  he  presented her with a glass of wine and water  and  as she complained of    6 22 15  3 45 PM   being faint  enriched the draught with some drops of a certain elixir   which he recommended as a most excellent restorative  though it was no  other than a stimulating tincture  which he had treacherously provided  for the occasion  Having swallowed this potion  by which her spirits  were manifestly exhilarated  she ate a slice of ham  with the wing of a  cold pullet  and concluded the meal with a glass of burgundy  which  she drank at the earnest entreaty of her admirer  These extraordinary  cordials co operating with the ferment of her blood  which was heated by  violent motion  could not fail to affect the constitution of a delicate  young creature  who was naturally sprightly and volatile  Her eyes began  to sparkle with unusual fire and vivacity  a thousand brilliant sallies  of wit escaped her  and every mask that accosted her underwent some  smarting repartee   Peregrine  overjoyed at the success of his administration  proposed that  they should resume their places at the country dances  with a view to  promote and assist the efficacy of his elixir  and  when he thought her  disposition was properly adapted for the theme  began to ply her with  all the elocution of love  In order to elevate his own spirits to  that pitch of resolution which his scheme required  he drank two whole  bottles
