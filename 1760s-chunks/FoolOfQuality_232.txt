   My fury smoothed its crest  my passions subsided  and I felt   nothing more of rancour against my brother  or resistance against   my God      The activity of the soul will find itself employment  As I had   now no further prospect or concern upon earth  I began to turn   my thoughts and attention toward heaven  I locked myself into   yonder closet  I threw myself into the dust  I have sinned  I   cried I have greatly sinned  O God   I am nothing I am crushed   even lower than the nothing that I am   spare  spare me from a   deeper perdition  I beseech thee       I felt that my prayer was heard   peace descended upon me like   dew upon the night   the day star began gradually to dawn to my   soul   the dark kingdom of Satan gave way before the kingdom   of the Son of light and love   and I would no more have entertained   any one of my former passions than I would have taken burning   coals and have buttoned them up in my bosom      B         242 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      I was greatly delighted  father  with this part  and some more of   Mr  Ruth s story   and I got him to repeat it over and over  that   I might remember it the better      I now  continued he I now pitied my brother as much as ever   I had hated him  I grieved for having caused the loss of his peace    I wished to restore it to him  I wrote a penitential acknowledg    ment of my faults  I besought his pardon  in the humblest manner    for the unfortunate blow  I subscribed to the justice of my con    sequent sufferings   and I sent my son here  to attend his lordship   with my lowly address      The triumph which this humiliation gave to my brother  supplied   him with patience to go through my memorial  But then con    ceiving  as I suppose  that it was dictated by mercenary meanness   and hypocrisy  he tore it to pieces and dashed it into the fire    Then returning to my child the box which had so inflamed the soul   of his lordship  he kicked my poor little fellow out of his house      My child came home to me weeping sadly   but I consoled him   the best I could  and mingled my tears with his   not in any re    sentment for the treatment received  but through grief for the   inveteracy of my unhappy brother  O my God  I cried  I no   longer repine at my abasement  at the weight of my sufferings and   mortifications   I bless thee for them  God   they have proved my   best friends  my most salutary physicians  Cruel and stern  indeed    is the porter who stands at the iron gate of pain   but O  it opens   upon regions of inward delight   for He who clothed Himself with   the cross is all glorious within      My happy experience of this truth opened for me a new prospect   into the mystery of God s dispensation to mortals  and threw a   number of shining lights on those very articles of gospel redemption   which had formerly appeared to me so exceptionable and gloomy    If God  said I to myself  hath suffered man to fall  he hath also   provided for him every possible means of recovery and restoration      Wherefore  when sin came into the world  God also sent suffering    its inseparable attendant  to be a cure and an antidote to the poison   thereof  If sin  therefore  hath thrust the kingdom of heaven from   within us  suffering comes  as God s forerunner  it relaxes and   unfolds the brazen gates of our polluted temple  that Christ  our   righteousness  may enter  the very hem of whose garment is salva    tion to every soul that lays hold upon it      Here I took Mr  Ruth about the neck  and kissing him  said  that   I was sure my father would be willing to pay his whole debt  in   return for the sweet instructions which he had given to his Harry    You speak of your father  my dear  said he  as though he were   the representative of God in the gospel  who forgave to his servant   ten thousand talents  What you have given me already  master    is beyond any human bounty that ever I heard of  I shall  there    fore  lay by two of these notes  till I am better
