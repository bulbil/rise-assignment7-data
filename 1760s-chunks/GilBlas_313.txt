reason to take on and be pettish  Your own dear self  beyond all question  replied Scipio  Beyond all question  re echoed she  my own ill used self  Don Ferdinand  very shortly after you had taken yourself off from Toledo  married Julia  with whom I continued as long as she lived  and  after we had lost her by sudden death  I came into my lady her sister s service  who  as well as all her maids  and I would do as much for them  will give me a good character  honest and sober  and a very termagant among the impertinent fellows   My secretary  having nothing to allege against such a character from my lady and her maids  was determined to make the best of a bad bargain  Once for all  said he to his spouse  I acknowledge my bad behaviour  and beg pardon for it before this honourable assembly  It was now time for me to act the mediator  and to move Beatrice for an act of amnesty  assuring her that her husband from this time forward would make it the great object of his life to play the husband to her satisfaction  She began to see that there was reason in roasting of eggs  and all present were loud in their congratulations  on the triumph of suffering virtue  and the renovated pledge of broken vows  To bind the contract firmer  and make it memorable  they were seated next to one another at table  their healths were drank according to the laws of toasting  wish you joy  many returns of this happy day  rang round on every side  one would have sworn that the dinner was given for their reconciliation  and not on account of my marriage   The third table was the first to be cleared  The young villagers jumped up in a body  the lads took out their blooming partners  the tambourines struck up a merry beat  spectators flocked from the other tables  and caught the enlivening spirit from the gay bustle of the scene  Every limb and muscle of every individual was in motion  the household of the governor and his lady formed a set  apart from the rustics of the company  while their superiors did not disdain to mingle with the homelier dancers  Don Alphonso danced a saraband with Seraphina  and Don Caesar another with Antonia  who afterwards took me for her partner  She did not perform much amiss  considering that she never got much further than the five positions  in learning which she had her ankles kicked to pieces by a provincial dancing master at Albarazin  while on a visit to a tradesman s wife  one of her relations  As for me  who  as I have already said  had taken lessons at the Marchioness de Chaves s  I figured away as the principal man in this rural ballet  With regard to Beatrice and Scipio  they preferred a little private conversation to dancing  that they might compare notes on the subject of war and tear during the painful period of separation  but their billing and cooing was interrupted by Seraphina  who  having been informed of this dramatic discovery  sent for them to pay the customary compliments of congratulation  My good people  said she  on this day of general joy  it gives me additional pleasure to see you two restored to one another  My friend Scipio  I return you your wife under a firm belief that she has always conducted herself as became a woman  take up your abode with her here  and be a good husband to her  And you  Beatrice  attach yourself to Antonia  and let her be as much the object of your devoted service as Signor de Santillane is that of your husband  Scipio  who could not possibly  after this  think of Penelope as fit to hold a candle to his own wife  promised to treat her with all the deference due to such a paragon of conjugal fidelity   The country people  having kept up the dance till late  withdrew to their own homes  but the rejoicings were prolonged by the company in the house  There was a grand supper  and at bed time the vicar general pronounced the blessing of consummation  Seraphina undressed the bride  and the lords of Leyva did me the same honour  The ridiculous part of the business was  that Don Alphonso s officers and his lady s attendants took it into their heads  by way of diverting themselves  to perform the same ceremony  they also undressed Beatrice and Scipio  who  to render the scene supremely farcical  gravely allowed themselves to be untrussed  and put to bed with all nuptial pomp and state       CH  X     The honey moon  a very dull time for the reader as a third person  enlivened by the commencement of Scipio s story           Tis heaven itself   tis ecstacy of bliss   Uninterrupted joy  untired excess   Mirth following mirth  the moments dance away   Love claims the night  and friendship rules the day       ON the day after the wedding the lords of Leyva returned to Valencia  after having lavished on me a thousand marks of friendship  There was such
