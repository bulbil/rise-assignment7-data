as you gay deceivers so well know how to do  and leave the rest to me  The event  I flatter myself will redound more than you are aware to the honour of my penetration   He must have been a strange lover who would not have profited by so opportune an occasion of writing to his mistress  My letter was couched in the most pathetic terms  Felicia smiled at its contents  and said  that if the women knew the art of infatuating men  the men in return had borrowed their influence over women from the arch wheedler himself  My privy counsellor took the note  and went back to Don George s  with a special injunction that my windows should be fast shut for some days   Madam  said she  going up to Donna Helena  I met Don Gaston  He must needs endeavour to come round me with his flattering speeches  In tremulous accents  like a culprit pleading against his sentence  he begged to know whether I had spoken to you on his behalf  Then  in prompt and faithful compliance with your orders  I snapped up the words out of his mouth  To be sure  my tongue did run at a fine rate against him  I called him all manner of names  and left him in the street like a stock  staring at my termagant loquacity  I am delighted  answered Donna Helena  that you have disengaged me from that troublesome person  But there was no occasion to have snubbed him so unmercifully  A creature of your degree should always keep a good tongue in its mouth  Madam  replied the domestic  one cannot get rid of a determined lover by mincing one s words  though it comes to much the same thing when one flies into a passion  Don Gaston  for instance  was not to be bullied out of his senses  After having given it him on both sides of his ears  as I told you  I went on that errand of yours to the house of your relation  The lady  as ill luck would have it  kept me longer than she ought  I say longer than she ought  because my plague and torment met me on my return  Who the deuce would have thought of seeing him  It put me all in a twitter  but then my tongue  which at other times is apt to be in a twitter  stuck motionless in my mouth  While my tongue stuck motionless in my mouth  what did he do  He slid a paper into my hand without giving me time to consider whether I should take it or no  and made off in a moment   After this introduction  she drew my letter from under her stays  and gave it with half a banter to her mistress  who affected to read it in humorous scorn  but digested the contents most greedily  and then put on the starch  offended prude  In good earnest  Felicia  said she with all the gravity she could assume  you were extremely off your guard  quite bewildered and fascinated  to have taken the charge of such an epistle  What construction would Don Gaston put upon it  What must I think of it myself  You give me reason  by this strange behaviour  to mistrust your fidelity  while he must suspect me of encouraging his odious suit  Alas  he may  perhaps  lay that flattering unction to his soul  that my love is legible in these characters  and not his trespass  Only consider how you lay my towering pride  Oh  quite the reverse  madam  answered the petticoated pleader  it is impossible for him to think that  and if he did  he would soon be convinced with a flea in his ear  I shall tell him  when next we meet  that I have delivered his letter  that you glanced at the superscription with petrifying indifference  and then  without reading a word  tore it into ten thousand pieces  You may swear that I did not read it with a safe conscience  replied Donna Helena  I should be puzzled to retrace a single sentiment  Don George s daughter  not contented with these words  suited the action to them  tore my letter  and imposed silence on my advocate   As I had promised no longer to play the lover at my window  the farce of obedience was kept up for several days  Ogling being interdicted  my courtship was doomed to enter in at my Helena s obdurate ears  One night I at tended under her balcony with musicians  the first bars of the serenade were already playing  when a swaggering blade  sword in hand  rushed in upon our harmony  laying about him to the right and left  to the utter discomfiture of the troop  Such mad warfare fired my tilting propensities to equal fury  The affray became serious  Donna Helena and her maid were disturbed by the clash of swords  They looked out at their lattice  and saw two men engaged  Their cries roused Don George and his servants  The whole neighbourhood was assembled to part the combatants  But they came too late  on the field of battle  bathed in his own blood and almost lifeless  lay my unfortunate body  They carried me to my aunt s  and sent
