I go  All my views of fortune have been long blasted  I have no friends nor connexions in the world  I must  therefore  starve in some sequestered corner  or be recaptivated and confined for ever to close prison  deprived of the indulgences which I now enjoy    Here the conversation was broke off by another uproar  which was the signal to battle between the doctor and his antagonist  The company immediately adjourned to the field  where the combatants were already undressed  and the stakes deposited  The doctor seemed of the middle age and middle stature  active and alert  with an atrabilarious aspect  and a mixture of rage and disdain expressed in his countenance  The brewer was large  raw boned  and round as a butt of beer  but very fat  unwieldy  short winded  and phlegmatic  Our adventurer was not a little surprised when he beheld  in the character of seconds  a male and female stripped naked from the waist upwards  the latter ranging on the side of the physician  but the commencement of the battle prevented his demanding of his guide an explanation of this phenomenon  The doctor retiring some paces backwards  threw himself into the attitude of a battering ram  and rushed upon his antagonist with great impetuosity  foreseeing  that  should he have the good fortune to overturn him in the first assault  it would not be an easy task to raise him up again  and put him in a capacity of offence  But the momentum of Crabclaw s head  and the concomitant efforts of his knuckles  had no effect upon the ribs of Tapley  who stood firm as the Acroceraunian promontory  and stepping forward with his projected fist  something smaller and softer than a sledge hammer  struck the physician to the ground   In a trice  however  by the assistance of his female second  he was on his legs again  and grappling with his antagonist  endeavoured to tip him a fall  but instead of accomplishing his purpose  he received a cross buttock  and the brewer throwing himself upon him as he fell  had well nigh smothered him on the spot  The amazon flew to his assistance  and Tapley showing no inclination to get up  she smote him on the temple till he roared  The male second hastening to the relief of his principal  made application to the eyes of the female  which were immediately surrounded with black circles  and she returned the salute with a blow  which brought a double stream of blood from his nostrils  greeting him at the same time with the opprobrious appellation of a lousy son of a b— h  A combat more furious than the first would now have ensued  had not Felton interposed with an air of authority  and insisted on the man s leaving the field  an injunction which he forthwith obeyed  saying   Well  damme  Felton  you re my friend and commander  I ll obey your order—but the b— h will be foul of me before we sleep  —Then Felton advancing to his opponent   Madam   said he   I m very sorry to see a lady of your rank and qualifications expose yourself in this manner —for God s sake  behave with a little more decorum  if not for the sake of your own family  at least for the credit of your sex in general  —  Hark ye  Felton   said she   decorum is founded upon a delicacy of sentiment and deportment  which cannot consist with the disgraces of a jail  and the miseries of indigence —But I see the dispute is now terminated  and the money is to be drank  if you ll dine with us you shall be welcome  if not  you may die in your sobriety  and be d—ned    By this time the doctor had given out  and allowed the brewer to be the better man  yet he would not honour the festival with his presence  but retired to his chamber  exceedingly mortified at his defeat  Our hero was reconducted to Mr  Felton s apartment  where he sat some time without opening his mouth  so astonished he was at what he had seen and heard   I perceive  sir   said the prisoner   you are surprised at the manner in which I accosted that unhappy woman  and perhaps you will be more surprised when you hear that within these eighteen months she was actually a person of fashion  and her opponent  who by the bye is her husband  universally respected as a man of honour and a brave officer  —  I am  indeed   cried our hero   overwhelmed with amazement and concern  as well as stimulated by an eager curiosity to know the fatal causes which have produced such a reverse of character and fortune  But I will rein my curiosity till the afternoon  if you will favour me with your company at a tavern in the neighbourhood  where I have bespoke dinner  a favour which I hope Mr  Norton will have no objection to your granting  as he himself is to be of the party  —The prisoner thanked him for his kind invitation  and they adjourned immediately to the place  taking up the deputy marshal in their passage through the lodge or entrance of the prison
