eye was the gay furniture of this summer abode  but soon afterwards  casting a look towards a bed  of which the curtains were half undrawn on account of the heat  an object arrested my attention  which engrossed it with the deepest interest  A young lady  in spite of the thunderclaps which had been pealing round her  was sleeping there  motionless and undisturbed  I approached her very gently  and by the light of the taper I had seized  a complexion and features the most dazzling were submitted to my gaze  My spirits were all afloat at the discovery  A sensation of transport and delight came over me  but however my feelings might harass my own heart  my conviction of her high birth checked every presumptuous hope  and awe obtained a complete victory over desire  While I was drinking in floods of adoration at the shrine of her beauty  the goddess of my homage awoke   You may well suppose her consternation  at seeing a man  an utter stranger  in her bedchamber  and at midnight  She was terrified at this strange appearance  and uttered a loud shriek  I did my best to restore her composure  and throwing myself on my knees in the humblest posture  Madam  said I  fear nothing  My business here is not to hurt you  I was going on  but her alarm was so great that she was incapable of hearing my excuses  She called her woman with a most vehement importunity  and as she could get no answer  she threw over her a thin night gown at the foot of the bed  rushed rapidly out of the room  and darted into the apartments I had crossed  still calling her female establishment about her  as well as a younger sister whom she had under her care  I looked for nothing less than a posse of strapping footmen who were likely  without hearing my defence  to execute summary justice on so audacious a culprit  but by good luck  at least for me  her cries were to no purpose  they only roused an old domestic  who would have been but a sorry knight had any ravisher or magician invaded her repose  Nevertheless  assuming somewhat of courage from his presence  she asked me haughtily who I was  by what inlet and to what purpose I had presumptuously gained admission into her house  I began then to enter on my exculpation  and had no sooner declared that the open door of the summer house in the garden had invited my entrance  than she exclaimed as if thunderstruck    Just heaven  what an idea darts across my mind   As she uttered these words  she caught at the wax light on the table  then ran through all the apartments one after another  without finding either her attendants or her sister  She remarked  too  that all their personals and wardrobe were carried off  With such a comment on her hasty suspicions  she came up to me and said  in the hurried accent of suspense and perturbation  Traitor  add not hypocrisy to your other crimes  Chance has not brought you hither  You are in the train of Don Ferdinand de Leyva  and are an accomplice in his guilt  But hope not to escape  there are still people enough about me to secure you  Madam  said I  do not confound me with your enemies  Don Ferdinand de Leyva is a stranger to me  I do not even know who you are  You see before you an outcast  whom an affair of honour has compelled to fly from Madrid  and I swear by whatever is most sacred among men  that had not a storm overtaken me  I should never have set my foot over your threshold  Entertain  then  a more favourable opinion of me  So far from suspecting me for an accomplice in any plot against you  believe me ready to enlist in your defence  and to revenge your wrongs  These last words  and still more the sincere tone in which they were delivered  convinced the lady of my innocence  and she seemed no longer to look on me as her enemy  but if her anger abated it was only that her grief might sway more absolutely  She began weeping most bitterly  Her tears called forth my sympathy  and my affliction was scarcely less poignant than her own  though the cause of this contagious sorrow was still to be ascertained  Yet it was not enough to mingle my tears with hers  in my impatience to become her defender and avenger  an impulse of terrific fury came over me  Madam  exclaimed I  what outrage have you sustained  Let me know it  and your injuries are mine  Would you have me hunt out Don Ferdinand  and stab him to the heart  Only tell me on whom your justice would fall  and they shall suffer  You have only to give the word  Whatever dangers  whatever certain evils may be attendant on the execution of your orders  the unknown  whom you thought to be in league with your enemies  will brave them all in your cause   This enraptured devotion surprised the lady  and stopped the flowing of her tears  Ah  sir  said she  forgive this suspicion  and attribute it to the blindness of my cruel
