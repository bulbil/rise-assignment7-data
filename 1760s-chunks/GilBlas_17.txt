up and throwing his arms about my neck  Excuse me  added he  but worlds would not bribe me to suppress the rapturous emotions your honoured presence has excited   I could not answer him so glibly as I wished  not so much for want of words as of breath  for he hugged me so tight that I began to be alarmed for my wind pipe  As soon  however  as I had got my head out of durance  I replied  Signor cavalier  I had not the least conception that my name was known at Pegnaflor  Known  resumed he in the same pompous style  we keep a register of all great persons within a circuit of twenty leagues round us  You have the character of a prodigy here  and I have not a shadow of doubt  but one day or other Spain will be as proud of numbering you among her rare productions  as Greece of having given birth to her seven wise men  This fine speech was followed as before  and I really began to think that with all my classical honours I should at last be doomed to share the fate of Antaeus  If I had been master of ever so little experience  I should not have been the dupe of his rhodomontade  I must have discovered him by his outrageous compliments  to be one of those parasites who swarm in every town  and get into a stranger s company on his arrival  to appease the wolf in their stomachs at his expense  but my youth and vanity tempted me to draw a quite opposite conclusion  My admirer was very clever in my eyes  and I asked him to supper on the strength of it  Oh  most willingly  cried be  with all my heart and soul  My fortunate star predominates  now that I have the honour of being in company with the illustrious Gil Blas of Santillane  and I shall certainly make the most of my good fortune as long as it lasts  My appetite is rather delicate  but I will just sit down with you by way of being sociable  and if I can swallow a bit  only just not to look sulky  for we philosophers are careless of the body   These words were no sooner out of his mouth  than my panegyrist took his seat opposite to me  A cover was laid for him in due form and order  First he fell on the omelet with as much perseverance as if he had not tasted food for three whole days  By the complacency with which he eyed it I was morally certain the poor pancake was at death s door  I therefore ordered its heir apparent to succeed  and the business was despatched with such speed  that the second made its appearance on the table  just as we     no     I beg pardon     just as he had taken the last lick of its predecessor  He pressed forward the main business  however  with a diligence and activity proportioned to the importance of the object he had in view  so that he contrived to load me with panegyric on panegyric  without losing a single stroke in the progress of mastication  Now all this gave me no slender conceit of my pretty little self  When a man eats  he must drink  The first toast of course was my health  The second  in common civility  was my father and mother  whose happiness in having such an angel of a son  he could not sufficiently envy or admire  All this while he kept filling my glass  and challenging me to keep pace with him  It was impossible to be backward in doing justice to such excellent toasts and sentiments  the compliments with which they were seasoned did not come amiss  so that I got into such a convivial mood  at observing our second omelet to disappear not insensibly  as just to ask the landlord if he could not find us a little bit of fish  Master Corcuelo  who to all appearance played booty with the parasite  told me he had an excellent trout  but those who eat him must pay for him  I am afraid he is meat for your masters  Meat for our masters  exclaims my very humble servant in an angry tone of voice  that is more than you know  my friend  Are you yet to learn that the best of your larder is not too good for the renowned Gil Blas of Santillane  Go where he will  he is fit to table with princes   I was very glad that he took up the landlord s last expression  because if he had not  I should  I felt myself a little hurt at it  and said to Corcuelo with some degree of hauteur  Produce this trout of yours  and I will take the consequences  The landlord  who had got just what he wanted  set himself to work  and served it up in high order  At the first glance of this third course I saw such pleasure sparkling in the parasite s eyes  as proved him to be of a very complying temper  just as ready to do a kindness by the fish  as by those said eggs of which he had given so good an account  But at last he was obliged to lay down his arms for fear
