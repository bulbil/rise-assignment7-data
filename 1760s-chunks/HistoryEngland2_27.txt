James had no idea of the alteration of circumstances  his situation  he thought  supplied him with authority  and his zeal furnished him with hope of accomplishing this chimerical design   The success he met with in crushing a rebellion  in the opening of his reign  seemed to promise a favourable omen towards the completion of his wishes  The Duke of Monmouth  who had long   71 been at the head of faction  and inflamed all the discontent that molested the late King s reign  was now resolved to aim at the crown  He was the darling of the people  and some averred that the King had married his mother  and owned his legitimacy at his death  The Earl of Argyle seconded his views  and they formed a scheme of a double insurrection  Argyle first landed in Scotland  published his manifestoes  put himself at the head of two thousand five hundred men  and attempted to influence the nation  but  a formidable body of the King s forces coming against him  his army fell away  and he himself  after being wounded in attempting to escape  was taken by a peasant  standing up to his neck in water  Being brought to Edinburgh  he prepared for death  well knowing that it was not in the King s nature to forgive an enemy   The Duke of Monmouth was not more fortunate  he sailed from the Texel with three vessels  and arrived on the coasts of Dorsetshire with about fourscore followers  The country soon flocked in to his standard  and in two days his army was increased to two thousand men  The Earl of Feversham was sent to oppose him  and took post at Sedgemore  a village in Somersetshire  Monmouth resolved to fight him  and began his march about eleven in the night  with profound silence  but the Royalists were prepared for his reception  The action began at day break  Lord Grey  who commanded the Duke of Monmouth s horse  was routed at the first onset  The Duke  at the head of his infantry  bravely maintained his ground until he was charged in flank by the enemy s horse  who had been just now victorious  A total rout ensued  three hundred were killed in the engagement  and a thousand in the pursuit  The Duke escaped the carnage  and  in a shepherd s disguise  fled on foot  attended by a faithful companion  who had followed his fortunes into   72 England  Thus they travelled onward towards Dorsetshire  till  quite exhausted with hunger and fatigue  they lay down in a field  and covered themselves with stubble  In this forlorn situation he was found  with some pease in his pocket  which he had gathered in the fields to sustain life  His spirit sunk with his misfortunes  he wrote to the King  implored his mercy  the King gave him an audience  as if willing to satisfy his vengeance with the sight of a rival s misery  But his death was determined  and no intreaties could extort royal clemency  On the seaffold he resumed his former courage  handled the ax  declared that he meant well to the nation  and his head was cut off  but not till after the third blow   But it were happy for the nation  and fortunate for the King  if the blood that was already shed had been thought a sufficient explation for the late offence  The victorious army behaved with the most savage cruelty to the prisoners taken after the battle  Their inhumanity was properly seconded by Jefferies  who was sent on the western circuit to try the insurgents  His furious thirst of blood being inflamed by continual intoxication  he threatened  calumniated  and threw aside even the appearance of clemency  Men and women indiscrimately felt the effects of his savage zeal  and not less than two hundred and fifty persons expired under circumstances of wanton cruelty  Cruel Kings ever find cruel ministers   It was not to be expected  that these butcheries could acquire the King the love or the confidence of his people  or tend to alter their opinions  as they rather excited the secret abhorrence of every honest man  Yet he thought this a time favourable for the carrying on his scheme of religion and arbitrary government  An attempt at arbitrary power in Charles was  in some measure  excusable  as he   73 had a republican faction to oppose  and it might have been prudent  at that time  to overstep justice  in order to attain security  but the same designs in James were as unnecessary as impracticable  since there were few republicans remaining  and the people were satisfied with limited monarchy  But this weak and deluded Monarch was resolved to imitate one or two Princes of Europe  who had just before rendered themselves absolute  and he was incited to this project by Lewis XIV  who secretly desired his destruction  Thus instigated  he began his designs with the measures which he should not have used till their completion  He sent a splendid embassy to Rome  to acknowledge his obedience to the Pope  Innocent  who then filled the chair  was too good a politician to approve those childish measures  and gave his ambassador a very cool reception  He was sensible that the King was openly striking at those laws and opinions which it
