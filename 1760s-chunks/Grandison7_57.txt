Count of Belvedere  If she knows it  I will not answer for her right mind     144 My Uncle and Aunt  Lucy  Emily  were very curious after particulars  when we came home  as we did to supper   Sir Charles left it to Lady L  to manage with Lady G  who he knew expected a day of our beloved guests  and he himself apologized to them for the freedom he had taken of so disposing of them  They had the goodness to thank him for his freedom with them  But yet they long to see the admirable Lady  who could renounce the man of her choice from religious motives  yet love him still  fly to him for protection  yet be able to congratulate him on his marriage  and love his wife  She is great indeed  said my aunt—Lucy praised my generosity—But what is that which is called generosity in me  who am in full possession of all my wishes  to that of Clementina   Join  my dear grandmamma  in prayers for her happiness  the rather  as in it  from true affection  is concluded that of  Your HARRIET GRANDISON   LETTER XXXI  Lady GRANDISON  In Continuation   Monday  March 5   LADY L  and Lady Clementina came  just as we were preparing for breakfast   Lady L  had given her such an account of my friends  that she was desirous to see them  and  as she was pleased to say  to bespeak their favour to the poor fugitive  After the first salutations  she addressed my aunt Selby in French  being told that she spoke not Italian  You are happy  madam  said she  in a niece  who may challenge the world to shew her equal  and still more happy in her being blessed with such a husband  Merit is not always so well rewarded —My aunt was struck with the manner as well as with the words     145 She made a very pretty compliment to my uncle  who  having forgot his French  could only bow  and seem pleased  When Lucy was presented to her  as my uncle s niece  and my favourite correspondent  You must not  mademoiselle  said she  be angry with me  if I envy you   To Emily  Happy  happy  young Lady  said she  I have heard of you in Italy  Mrs  Beaumont spoke honourably of you to me  more than once  We both called you happy in such a guardian   She made polite compliments to Mr  Deane  and bespoke all their favour to her  How does everybody admire her   I hope  my dear grandmamma  you don t think I forget my cousin Reeves s  tho  I mentioned them not before  I have already called in upon them twice  And they have  with the kind freedom of relations  dropt in upon us several times  They are invited guests at Lord G s  I won t say Lady G s  tho  everybody else does   This is what I stole time to write  while Sir Charles is engaged in discourse with the Lady  and our guests are preparing to be gone to Lord G s  Lady G  requesting my aunt s company early  She is the veriest coward  These brave spirits  she has said  are but flash  Indeed the very delicate  as well as very serious  and even solemn  circumstances  which attend her case  must make the liveliest woman  when the time approaches  think —The inclosed note of hers to my aunt  brought late last night  is  however  in her usual stile   YOU and Lucy must be here early To morrow morning   What wretched simpletons are we women  Daughters of gewgaw  solly  ostentation  trifle —First  we shew our sorry fellow  when not disapproved  to our friends and relations  and take all their judgments   146 upon him  If he has their opinion in his favour  every body  be he what he will  will praise him  and give him riches  sense  ancestry  and I cannot tell what of qualities that perhaps we shall never find out  Then we shew our presents  our jewels  our laces  and a smile spreads the mouth  and a sparkle gladdens the eye  of every maiden that hangs admiring over them  Ah  filly maidens  if you could look three yards from your noses  you would pity  instead of envying  the milk white heifer dressed in ribbands  and just ready to be led to sacrifice   Well  then  what comes next  Why  the poor soul  in a few months  by the time perhaps her gratulatory visits are half paid her  begins to find apprehension take place of security  Then are she and all her virgins employed in the wretchedest trifles—If I thought you had forgot them  I would give you a list of them—And the poor fools  wrapping up their jewels in cotton  with sighs that perhaps they have worn them for the last time  and doubtful whom they may next adorn  cover the decked out milk white bed with their baby things  See here  and  See here
