for perhaps   he did not expect a poor servant would resist her master so much  And   must it not be looked upon as a sort of warrant for such actions  if   I stay after this  For  I think  when one of our sex finds she is   attempted  it is an encouragement to the attempter to proceed  if one   puts one s self in the way of it  when one can help it   Tis neither   more nor less than inviting him to think that one forgives  what  in   short  ought not to be forgiven  Which is no small countenance to foul   actions  I ll assure you       She hugged me to her  and said I ll assure you  Pretty face  where   gottest thou all thy knowledge  and thy good notions  at these years    Thou art a miracle for thy age  and I shall always love thee   But  do   you resolve to leave us  Pamela       Yes  my dear Mrs  Jervis  said I  for  as matters stand  how can I do   otherwise   But I ll finish the duties of my place first  if I may  and   hope you ll give me a character  as to my honesty  that it may not be   thought I was turned away for any harm  Ay  that I will  said she  I   will give thee such a character as never girl at thy years deserved  And   I am sure  said I  I will always love and honour you  as my third best   friend  wherever I go  or whatever becomes of me       And so we went to bed  and I never waked till  twas time to rise    which I did as blithe as a bird  and went about my business with great   pleasure       But I believe my master is fearfully angry with me  for he passed by me   two or three times  and would not speak to me  and towards evening  he   met me in the passage  going into the garden  and said such a word to   me as I never heard in my life from him to man  woman  or child  for he   first said  This creature s always in the way  I think  I said  standing   up as close as I could   and the entry was wide enough for a coach too     I hope I shan t be long in your honour s way  D  mn you  said he   that   was the hard word   for a little witch  I have no patience with you       I profess I trembled to hear him say so  but I saw he was vexed  and    as I am going away  I minded it the less  Well  I see  my dear parents    that when a person will do wicked things  it is no wonder he will speak   wicked words  May God keep me out of the way of them both                                                   Your dutiful DAUGHTER                   LETTER XIX         DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER       Our John having an opportunity to go your way  I write again  and send   both letters at once  I can t say  yet  when I shall get away  nor how   I shall come  because Mrs  Jervis shewed my master the waistcoat I   am flowering for him  and he said  It looks well enough  I think the   creature had best stay till she has finished it       There is some private talk carried on betwixt him and Mrs  Jervis    that she don t tell me of  but yet she is very kind to me  and I don t   mistrust her at all  I should be very base if I did  But to be sure she   must oblige him  and keep all his lawful commands  and other  I dare   say  she won t keep  She is too good  and loves me too well  but she   must stay when I am gone  and so must get no ill will       She has been at me again to ask to stay  and humble myself  But what   have I done  Mrs  Jervis  said I  If I have been a sauce box  and a   bold face  and a pert  and a creature  as he calls me
