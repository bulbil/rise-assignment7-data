in being  Such an act of injustice  there    fore  raised the indignation and pity of his honest  generous heart    and he resolved to set it aside  notwithstanding the trouble and   expense that must necessarily attend such an attempt      The greatest discouragement to his undertaking was the difSculty   of finding out and ascertaining the real heir  for the family was   apparently extinct  But upon examining into the many alliances   it had formerly made  which his known attachment gave him an   easy opportunity of doing  he found that some generations   before  a daughter had been married to a nobleman of a neigh    bouring dependent kingdom   the issue of which marriage  if   any remained  was the true and only representative of this noble   house      Having made this discovery  he went directly over to that king    dom  where  after a long and painful search  he had the mortification   to find that the family was reduced  by the revolutions of govern    ment andjithe calamity of the times  to two poor  low bred  illiterate   women  who had been married to mechanics of the meanest rank    and  being left widows  and without children  now strove to procure   a wretched subsistence by joining their poor stocks to keep a chand    ler s shop  in a city in the remotest part of the kingdom      So melancholy an instance of the instability of human grandeur   only raised his CQmpassion  and confirmed his resolution to vindicate   the blood of the illustrious patrons of his family from such injustice   and disgrace  Accordingly  he instantly relieved their immediate   distresses  and  taking all the proper methods for ascertaining their   descent  brought them over to this kingdom  lodged them in his own   house  and treated them with the respect due to their noble blood   and better hopes      As soon as everything was prepared for the great attempt  he   regularly demanded a restitution of their right from the unjust   possessor  and  upon his expected refusal  instituted a suit at law   for the recovery of it  in the prosecution of which neither diflBoulties   nor dangers  neither threats nor promises  could slacken his ardour   till he had obtained the justice he demanded for them  A detail   of the proceedings  in such an affair  must be distressing to any         110 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     humane heart  It is suffloient to say that every method which the   art of man could invent to impose upon judgment and defeat justice   was exerted against him for several years  in hopes of exhausting   his fortune  and wearing out the lives of his injured clients  the   elder of whom actually did die during the suit   and so disappointing   his hopes  But justice at length prevailed  and he recovered for   them the inheritance of their ancestors  leaving their antagonist   only the immediate acquisitions of his reputed father  which  large   as they are  he eagerly labours to increase by every artifice of sordid   avarice      As for the heiress  the exalted gratitude she showed proved her   noble blood  As soon as she had executed all the forms of law   necessary to give her an absolute power over her fortune  and justly   paid the expense  and rewarded the trouble of recovering it  as   every branch of her family was extinct  she thought it but justice   to settle her great fortune upon the generous reooverer of it  Nor   was she content with leaving it to him when she could no longer   make use of it herself  but  obliging him to quit the business of his   profession  she gave the greater part of it into his immediate pos    session  and  retiring to one of the principal seats upon her estate    spent the remainder of her life in happiness and esteem   the good    ness of her heart  and the true nobleness of her soul drowning her   want of early education in the superior radiance of innate virtue      The absolute possession of her entire fortune  which her death   gave him much sooner than he wished  has made no alteration in   the conduct of this worthy person  who invariably pursues the   dictates of justice and benevolence in all his actions  making his   wealth a blessing to all  whose wants and virtues mark them as   objects worthy of his regard and assistance          CHAPTER XXXVI     â€¢CONTINTJED   THE HAPPY TRUITS OF UNEQUAL MAEKIAGES â€” A SHOKT   WAY TO PAY LOIfQ DEBTS â€” THE PLEASURES OF POLITE LIFE â€” A   BOLD STROKE OF FEMALE GENIUS TBnjMPHAlTT OVER LAW AND   BBLIGION â€” AN UNLUCKY
