England  and receiving no   letters either from Dorilaus or his sister  was as it were weaned from   that affection he had formerly bore to them  and in the room of that the   new friendships he was every day contracting took up his mind       He was indeed used with so much love and respect by people in the most   eminent stations  to whom the baron had introduced him  that it would   have been ungrateful in him not to have returned it with the greatest   good will  Expressing one day some surprize at being so far forgotten by   his friends in England  de la Valiere told him that he would not have   him look on himself as any other than a guest in France  and that if he   chose to quit that country  he should not only be at his liberty to   return to England whenever he pleased  but also should be furnished with   a sum sufficient for the expences of his journey  but added  that the   offer he now made of depriving himself of so agreeable a companion was a   piece of self denial  than which there could not be a greater proof of a   disinterested regard       Horatio replied in the manner this generosity demanded  and said  that   if there was any thing irksome to him in France  it was only his   inability of returning the favours he had received  believe me  sir    pursued he  were I master of a fortune sufficient to put me above the   necessity of receiving the obligations I now do  it would not be in the   power of all I left in England to prevail on me to return   it is here    and in the society of that company I at present  thro  your means    enjoy  that I would wish to pass my whole life       The baron then told him he would find a way to make all things easy to   him  and accordingly went the same day to monsieur the prince of Conti    to whom he gave such an advantageous description of the courage and   accomplishments of the English cornet  and the inclination he had to   stay among them  that his highness told the baron  that he might   acquaint him from him  that if he were willing to serve under him he   should have a commission  or  if he rather chose a civil employment  he   would use his interest to procure him such a one as might afford both   honour and profit       This the baron did not fail to communicate immediately to Horatio  who    charm d with the generosity both of the one and the other  broke out   into the utmost encomiums of that nation   sure  said he  the French are   a people born to inspire and instruct virtue and benevolence to all the   kingdoms in the world  After the first raptures of his gratitude were   over  being pressed by the baron to let him know which of the prince s   offers he would chuse to accept  alas  replied he  this is a kind of an   unfortunate dilemma I am in   my inclinations are for the army  and it   would be the height of my ambition to serve under such generals as the   French  but it would be unnatural in me to draw my sword against the   land which gave me being  O would to God  continued he  there were an   opportunity for me to do it in any other cause  how gladly would I leave   the best part of my blood to shew the sense I have of the generosity I   have experienced       The baron had nothing to offer in opposition to a sentiment which he   found had so much of honour in it  and therefore acquainted the prince   that he chose to accept of his highness s favour in a civil employment    on which he was ordered to attend his levee the next day       His good friend accompanied him  and having presented him with the forms   usual on such occasions  the prince received him very graciously  and   was pleased to ask him several questions concerning the government of   England at that time  the battle in which he had been taken  and many   other things  to all which the young Horatio answered with so much   discretion and politeness  as made the prince say to the baron  you have   not flattered this gentleman in your description of him  for tho  I   believe your friendship ready enough to give a just idea of him  yet  I   allure you  his own behaviour is his best recommendation  and well   entitles him to more than I find it in my power to do for him at   present  I have been thinking for you  sir  continued he
