strange man  Sir Charles Grandison—If I must be compelled to see Sir Harry—But you are a strange man—And she rang the bell   Lady Beauchamp  Dr  Bartlett  is one of those who would be more ready to forgive an innocent freedom  than to be gratified by a profound respect  otherwise I had not treated her with so little ceremony  Such women are formidable only to those who are afraid of their anger  or who make it a serious thing   But when the servant appeared  she not knowing how to condescend  I said  Go to your Master  Sir  and tell him that your Lady requests the favour—Requests the favour  repeated she  but in a low voice  Which was no bad sign   The servant went with a message worded with more civility than perhaps he was used to carry to his master from his lady   Now  dear Lady Beauchamp  for your own sake  for Sir Harry s sake  make happy and be happy  Are there not  dear madam  unhappinesses enow in life  that we must wilfully add to them   Sir Harry came in fight  He stalked towards us with a parade like that of a young officer wanting to look martial at the head of his company   Could I have seen him before he enter d  my work would have been easier  But his hostile air disposed my Lady to renew hostilities   She turned her face aside  then her person  and the cloudy indignation with which she entered at first  again overspread her features  Ought wrath  Dr    30 Bartlett  to be so ready to attend a female will —Surely  thought I  my Lady s present airs  after what has passed between her and me  can be only owing to the fear of making a precedent  and being thought too easily persuaded   Sir Harry  said I  addressing myself to him  I have obtained Lady Beauchamp s pardon for the officious Letter—  Pardon  Sir Charles Grandison  You are a good man  and it was kindly intended—  He was going on  Anger from his eyes flashed upon his cheek bones  and made them shine  My Lady s eyes struck fire at Sir Harry  and shewed that she was not afraid of him   Better intended  than done  interrupted I  since my Lady tells me  that it was the occasion of a misunderstanding—But  Sir  all will be right  My Lady assures me  that you are not disinclined to comply with the contents  and she has the goodness—  Pray  Sir Charles  interrupted the Lady—  To give me hopes that she—  Pray Sir Charles—  Will use her interest to confirm you in your favourable Sentiments—  Sir Harry cleared up at once—May I hope  madam—And offered to take her hand   She withdrew it with an air  O Dr  Bartlett  I must have been thought an unpolite husband  had she been my wife   I took her hand  Excuse this freedom  Sir Harry—For heaven s sake  madam  whispering  Do what I know you will do  with a grace—Shall there be a misunderstanding  and the husband court a refused hand —I then forc d her half unwillig hand into his  with an air that I intended should have both freedom and respect in it   What a man have we got here  Sir Harry  This cannot be the modest man  that you have praised to   31 me—I thought a good man must of necessity be bashful  if not sheepish  And here your visitor is the boldest man in England   The righteous  Lady Beauchamp  said Sir Harry  with an aspect but half conceding  is hold as a lion   And must I be compelled thus  and by such a man  to forgive you  Sir Harry —Indeed you were very unkind   And you  Lady Beauchamp  were very cruel   I did not think  Sir  when I laid my fortune at your feet—  O Lady Beauchamp  You said cutting things▪ Very cutting things   And did not you  Sir Harry  say  It should be so —so very peremptorily   Not  madam  till you  as peremptorily—  A little recrimination  thought I  there must be to keep each in countenance on their past folly   Ah  Sir Charles —You may rejoice that you are not married  said Sir Harry   Dear Sir Harry  said I  we must bear with Ladies They are meek good creatures—They—  Meek  Sir Charles  repeated Sir Harry  with an half angry smile  and shrugging  as if his shoulder had been hurt with his wife s meekness—I say  meek   Now  Sir Charles Grandison  said my Lady  with an air of threatening—  I was desirous either of turning the Lady s displeasure into a jest  or of diverting it from the first object  in order to make her play with it  till she had lost it   Women are of gentle natures  pursued I  and  being accustomed to be humoured  opposition sits not easy upon them  Are they not kind to us  Sir Harry  when they allow of our superiority  by expecting us  to bear
