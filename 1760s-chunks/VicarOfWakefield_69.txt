the unhappy  and levels all human enjoyments to nearly the same standard  It gives to both rich and poor the same happiness hereafter  and equal hopes to aspire after it  but if the rich have the advantage of enjoying pleasure here  the poor have the endless satisfaction of knowing what it was once to be miserable  when crowned with endless felicity hereafter  and even though this should be called a small advantage  yet being an eternal one  it must make up by duration what the temporal happiness of the great may have exceeded by intenseness     These are therefore the consolations which the wretched have peculiar to themselves  and in which they are above the rest of mankind  in other respects they are below them  They who would know the miseries of the poor must see life and endure it   Page  158  To declaim on the temporal advantages they enjoy  is only repeating what none either believe or practise  The men who have the necessaries of living are not poor  and they who want them must be miserable  Yes  my friends  we must be miserable  No vain efforts of a refined imagination can sooth the wants of nature  can give elastic sweetness to the dank vapour of a dungeon  or ease to the throbbings of a woe worn heart  Let the philosopher from his couch of softness tell us that we can resist all these  Alas  the effort by which we resist them is still the greatest pain  Death is slight  and any man may sustain it  but torments are dreadful  and these no man can endure     To us then  my friends  the promises of happiness in heaven should be peculiarly dear  for if our reward be in this life alone  we are then indeed of all men the most miserable   Page  159  When I look round these gloomy walls  made to terrify  as well as to confine us  this light that only serves to shew the horrors of the place  those shackles that tyranny has imposed  or crime made necessary  when I survey these emaciated looks  and hear those groans  O my friends  what a glorious exchange would heaven be for these  To fly through regions unconfined as air  to bask in the sunshine of eternal bliss  to carrol over endless hymns of praise  to have no master to threaten or insult us  but the form of goodness himself for ever in our eyes  when I think of these things  death becomes the messenger of very glad tidings  when I think of these things  his sharpest arrow becomes the staff of my support  when I think of these things  what is there in life worth having  when I think of these things  what is there that should not be spurned away  kings in their palaces should groan for such advantages   Page  160  but we  humbled as we are  should yearn for them     And shall these things be ours  Ours they will certainly be if we but try for them  and what is a comfort  we are shut out from many temptations that would retard our pursuit  Only let us try for them  and they will certainly be ours  and what is still a comfort  shortly too  for if we look back on past life  it appears but a very short span  and whatever we may think of the rest of life  it will yet be found of less duration  as we grow older  the days seem to grow shorter  and our intimacy with time  ever lessens the perception of his stay  Then let us take comfort now  for we shall soon be at our journey s end  we shall soon lay down the heavy burthen laid by heaven upon us  and though death  the only friend of the wretched  for a little while mocks the weary traveller with the view  and like his  Page  161  horizon  still flies before him  yet the time will certainly and shortly come  when we shall cease from our toil  when the luxurious great ones of the world shall no more tread us to the earth  when we shall think with pleasure on our sufferings below  when we shall be surrounded with all our friends  or such as deserved our friendship  when our bliss shall be unutterable  and still  to crown all  unending     Page   unnumbered   CHAP  XI     Happier prospects begin to appear  Let us be inflexible  and fortune will at last change in our favour     WHEN I had thus finished and my audience was retired  the gaoler  who was one of the most humane of his profession  hoped I would not be displeased  as what he did was but his duty  observing that he must be obliged to remove my son into a stronger cell  but that he should be permitted to revisit me every morning  I thanked him for his clemency  and grasping my boy s hand  bade him farewell  and be mindful of the great duty that was before him     Page  164  I again  therefore laid me down  and one of my little ones sate by my bedside reading
