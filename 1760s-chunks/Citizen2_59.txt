revived  which would furnish both a motto and a name  the ladies might be permitted to chuse for themselves  There are for instance the obsolete orders of the Dragon in Germany  of the Rue in Scotland  and the Porcupine in France  all well sounding names  and very applicable to my intended female institution   Adieu   LETTER CVIII  To the same   RELIGIOUS Sects in England are far more numerous than in China  Every man who has interest enough to hire a conventicle here  may set up for himself and sell off a new religion  The sellers of the newest pattern at present give extreme good bargains  and let their disciples have a great deal of confidence for very little money     183Their shops are much frequented  and their customers every day encreasing  for people are naturally fond of going to Paradise at as small expence as possible   Yet you must not conceive this modern sect as differing in opinion from those of the established religion  Difference of opinion indeed formerly divided their sectaries  and sometimes drew their armies to the field  White gowns and black mantles  slapped hats and cross pocket holes were once the obvious causes of quarrel  men then had some reason for fighting  they knew what they fought about  but at present they are arrived at such refinement in religion making  that they have actually formed a new sect without a new opinion  they quarrel for opinions they both equally defend  they hate each other  and that is all the difference between them   But though their principles are the same  their practice is somewhat different  Those of the established religion laugh when they are pleased  and their groans are seldom extorted but by pain or danger  The new sect  on the contrary  weep for their amusement  and use little music except a chorus of sighs and groans  or tunes that are made to imitate groaning  Laughter is their aversion  lovers court each other from the lamentations  the bridegroom approaches the nuptial couch in sorrowful solemnity  and the bride looks more dismal than an undertaker s shop  Dancing round the room is with them running in a direct line to the devil  and as for gaming  though but in jest  they would sooner play with a rattle snake s tail  than finger a dice box     184By this time you perceive that I am describing a sect of Enthusiasts  and you have already compared them with the Faquirs  Bramins  and Talapoins of the East  Among these  you know  are generations that have been never known to smile  and voluntary affliction makes up all the merit they can boast of  Enthusiasms in every country produce the same effects  stick the Faquir with pins  or confine the Bramine to a vermine hospital  spread the Talapoin on the ground  or load the Sectary s brow with contrition  those worshipers who discard the light of reason  are ever gloomy  their fears encrease in proportion to their ignorance  as men are continually under apprehensions who walk in darkness   Yet there is still a stronger reason for the enthusiast s being an enemy to laughter  namely  his being himself so proper an object of ridicule  It is remarkable that the propagators of false doctrines have ever been averse to mirth  and always begin by recommending gravity  when they intended to disseminate imposture  Fohi  the idol of China  is represented as having never laughed  Zoroaster the leader of the Bramins is said to have laughed but twice  upon his coming into the world  and upon his leaving it  and Mahomet himself  though a lover of pleasure  was a professed opposer of gaiety  Upon a certain occasion telling his followers  that they would all appear naked at the resurrection  his favourite wife represented such an assembly as immodest and unbecoming  Foolish woman  cried the grave prophet  though the whole assembly be naked  on that day they shall have forgotten to laugh  Men like him opposed ridicule  because they knew it to be a most formidable   185 antagonist  and preached up gravity  to conceal their own want of importance   Ridicule has ever been the most powerful enemy of enthusiasm  and properly the only antagonist that can be opposed to it with success  Persecution only serves to propagate new religions  they acquire fresh vigour beneath the executioner and the ax  and like some vivacious insects  multiply by dissection  It is also impossible to combat enthusiasm with reason  for though it makes a shew of resistance  it soon eludes the pressure  refers you to distinctions not to be understood  and feelings which it cannot explain  A man who would endeavour to fix an enthusiast by argument  might as well attempt to spread quicksilver with his fingers  The only way to conquer a visionary is to despise him  the stake  the faggot  and the disputing Doctor  in some measure ennoble the opinions they are brought to oppose  they are harmless against innovating pride  contempt alone is truly dreadful  Hunters generally know the most vulnerable part of the beasts they pursue  by the care which every animal takes to defend the side which is weakest  on what side the enthusiast is most vulnerable  may be known by the care which he takes in the beginning to work his
