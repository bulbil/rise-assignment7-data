down stairs more than once or twice  I then told them the circumstance of my illness  and that I had been up and down myself  with all that passed between my bedfellow and me  Somebody proposed to search me  several began to turn my pockets inside out  and from my waistcoat tumbled the penknife and the piece of money I have already mentioned  and I had entirely forgot  Upon seeing these the woman immediately screamed out  O God  there s my uncle s penknife  then taking up the money  and calling the people about her  Here  said she  is what puts the villain s guilt   7 beyond a doubt  I can swear to this William and Mary s guinea  my uncle has long had it by way of pocket piece  and engraved the first letters of his name upon it  She then began to cry afresh  while I could do nothing but continue to call heaven to witness that I was as innocent as the child unborn  The constable who had heard me mention the having gone down into the garden  told the people I must have thrown the body down the necessary  and going thither  Here  said he  after having cut the throat  he has let the body down into the sea  This every body immediately assented to  Then   said the master of the house  it is in vain to look for the body any further  for there was a spring tide last night which has carried it off   The consequence of these proceedings was an immediate examination before a justice of peace  after which I suffered a long and rigorous imprisonment in the county town of Maidstone  For some time  my father  my master and my relations were inclined to think me innocent  because I declared I was so  as well I might  and in compliance with my earnest request  an advertisement was published in the London Gazette  representing my deplorable circumstances  and offering a reward to any person who could give tidings of Mr  Richard Collings   the man I was supposed to have murdered  either alive or dead  No information  however  of any kind came to hand  at the assizes therefore  I was brought up to my trial  and circumstances appearing strong against me  I received sentence to be carried in a cart the Wednesday fortnight following to the town of Deal  and there to be hanged before the Inn keeper s door where I had committed the murder  after which I was to be hung in chains within a stone s throw of my brother s house     8Nothing could have supported me under this dreadful condemnation  but a consciousness of my not being guilty of the crime for which I was to suffer  My friends now began to consider my declarations of my innocence  as persisting in falshood to the perdition of my soul  many of them discontinued their enquiries after me  and those few who still came to visit me  only came to urge me to confession  but I was resolved I would never die with a lie of that kind in my mouth   The Monday was now arrived before the fatal day  when an end was to be put to my miseries▪ I was called down into the court of the prison  but I own I was not a little shocked  when I found it was to be taken measure of for my irons in which I was to be hung after execution  A fellow prisoner appeared before me in the same woful plight   he had robbed the mail  and the Smith was measuring him when I came down  while tha Goaler  with as much calmness as if he had been ordering a pair of stays for his daughter  was giving directions in what manner the irons should be made  so as to support the man who was remarkably heavy and corpulent   Between this and the day of execution  I spent my time alone in prayer and meditation     9At length Wednesday morning came  and about three o clock I was put in a cart  but sure such a day of wind  rain and thunder  never blew out of the heavens  and when we arrived at Deal  it became so violent  that the Sheriff and his Officers  could scarce sit their horses  for my own part  I was insensible to every object about me  I therefore heard the Sheriff whisper the Executioner to make what dispatch he could  without the least emotion  and suffered him to tuck me up like a log of wood  unconscious of what he was doing   I can give no account of what I felt when hanging  only remember  after being turned off  something appeared about me like a blaze of fire  nor do I know how long I hung  no doubt the violence of the weather favoured me greatly in that circumstance  What I am now going to tell you  I learned from my brother  which was  that having hung half an hour  the Sheriff s officers all went off  and I was cut down by the Executioner  but when he came to put the irons upon me  it was found that the irons of the other man which were too large for me  had been sent instead of mine  this
