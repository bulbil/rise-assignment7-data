opportunity  and join force with it  on occasion  when I am   least prepared  for now he seems to abound with kindness  and talks   of love without reserve  and makes nothing of allowing himself in the   liberty of kissing me  which he calls innocent  but which I do not like    and especially in the manner he does it  but for a master to do it at   all to a servant  has meaning too much in it  not to alarm an honest   body          Wednesday morning       I find I am watched and suspected still very close  and I wish I was   with you  but that must not be  it seems  this fortnight  I don t like   this fortnight  and it will be a tedious and a dangerous one to me  I   doubt       My master just now sent for me down to take a walk with him in the   garden  but I like him not at all  nor his ways  for he would have  all   the way  his arm about my waist  and said abundance of fond things to   me  enough to make me proud  if his design had not been apparent  After   walking about  he led me into a little alcove  on the farther part of   the garden  and really made me afraid of myself  for he began to be very   teasing  and made me sit on his knee  and was so often kissing me  that   I said  Sir  I don t like to be here at all  I assure you  Indeed you   make me afraid   And what made me the more so  was what he once said   to Mrs  Jewkes  and did not think I heard him  and which  though always   uppermost with me  I did not mention before  because I did not know how   to bring it in  in my writing       She  I suppose  had been encouraging him in his wickedness  for it was   before the last dreadful trial  and I only heard what he answered       Said he  I will try once more  but I have begun wrong for I see terror   does but add to her frost  but she is a charming girl  and may be thawed   by kindness  and I should have melted her by love  instead of freezing   her by fear       Is he not a wicked  sad man for this   To be sure  I blush while I write   it  But I trust  that that God  who has delivered me from the paw of the   lion and the bear  that is  his and Mrs  Jewkes s violences  will soon   deliver me from this Philistine  that I may not defy the commands of the   living God       But  as I was saying  this expression coming into my thoughts  I was   of opinion  I could not be too much on my guard  at all times  more   especially when he took such liberties  for he professed honour all the   time with his mouth  while his actions did not correspond  I begged and   prayed he would let me go  and had I not appeared quite regardless of   all he said  and resolved not to stay  if I could help it  I know not   how far he would have proceeded  for I was forced to fall down upon my   knees       At last he walked out with me  still bragging of his honour and his   love  Yes  yes  sir  said I  your honour is to destroy mine  and your   love is to ruin me  I see it too plainly  But  indeed  I will not talk   with you  sir  said I  any more  Do you know  said he  whom you talk to    and where you are       You may believe I had reason to think him not so decent as he should be    for I said  As to where I am  sir  I know it too well  and that I have   no creature to befriend me  and  as to whom I talk to  sir  let me ask   you  What you would have me answer       Why  tell me  said he  what answer you would make  It will only make you   angry  said I  and so I shall fare worse  if possible  I won t be angry    said he  Why  then  sir  said I  you cannot be my late good lady s son    for she loved me  and taught me virtue  You cannot then be my master
