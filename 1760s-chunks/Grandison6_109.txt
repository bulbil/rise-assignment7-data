find  in tenderness to her  asked no questions yesterday  made no claim—She could not begin the subject   But  said Lucy  I cannot but say  that my cousin is in some fault   Look you there  now  said my uncle   We all stared at Lucy  for she spoke and looked very seriously   Might she not have said  proceeded she  when Sir Charles surprized her at his first arrival  what tho  her heart was divided between past terror  and present joy   Here I am  Sir  at your service  Are you prepared for to morrow —And then made him one of her best courtesies   Sauce box —Well  well  I believe I have been a little hasty in my judgment  rapping under the table with his knuckles   But I am so afraid that something will happen between the cup and the lip—Here  last night  I dreamt that Lady Clementina and he were going to be married—Give me your hand  my dear Harriet  and don t revoke the kindness in your last Letter to him  but whatever be the day he proposes  comply  and you will win my heart for ever   As Sir Charles leads  Harriet must follow  resumed my grandmamma  You men are sad prescribers in these delicate cases  Mr  Selby  You will be put to it  my dear love  taking my hand  before this day is over  now you seem so purely recovered  Sir Charles Grandison is not a dreaming Lover  Prepare your mind  my child  You ll be put to it  I do assure you     272 Why  oy  I can t but say  Sir Charles is a man—Don t you  my lovely Love  be too much a woman —Too close a copier of your aunt Selby here —and  as I said  you will have my heart for ever—Oy  and Sir Charles s too  for he is not one of your sorry fellows that can t distinguish between a favour and a folly   My uncle then went out with a flourish  and took Mr  Deane with him  leaving only my grandmamma  my aunt  my Lucy  and your Harriet  together   We had a good deal of talk upon the important subject  The conclusion was  that I would refer Sir Charles to my grandmamma  if he were urgent for the day  and she was vested with a discretionary power to determine for her girl   Such of my cloaths  then  as were near finished  were ordered to be produced  with some of the nuptial ornaments  They were all to sit in judgment upon them   Surely  Lady G  these are solemn circumstances  lightly as my uncle thinks of them  Must not every thoughtful young creature  on so great a change  and for life  have conflicts in her mind  be her prospects ever so happy  as the day approaches  Of what materials must the hearts of runaways  and of fugitives  to men half strangers to them  be compounded   My aunt has just left with me the following Billet  from Sir Charles  directed to my uncle  from Mr  Greville s   Dear Mr  Selby   I Regret every moment that I pass out of Selby house  or Shirley manor  And as I have so few particular friends in these parts out of your family  I think I ought to account to you for the hours I do  Nor will I  now our friendship is so unalterably fixed and acknowleged  apologize for giving myself  by this means  the consequence with your family  that every one of yours  for their single sakes  are of to me    273 superadded to the tenderest attachments to one dear person of it   I found the gentleman in a less happy disposition than I expected   It is with inexpressible reluctance that he thinks  as my happy day draws near  of giving up all hopes of an object so dear to him  He seemed strangely balancing on this subject  when I was introduced to him  He instantly proposed to me  and with some fierceness  that I would suspend all thoughts of marriage for two months to come  or at least for one  I received his request with proper indignation  He pretended to give reasons respecting himself  I allowed not of them   After some canvassings  he swore  that he would be complied with in something  His alternative was  the dining with him  and with some of his chosen friends  whom he had invited   I have reason to think these friends are those to whom he expressed himself with violence at the George  as overheard  I suppose  by the waiter there   He rode out  he owned  yesterday morning  with intent to meet me  for he boasts that he knows all my motions  and those of a certain beloved young Lady  Let him  let every body  who think it their concern to watch our steps  be made acquainted with them  The honest heart aims not at secrets  I should glory in receiving Miss Byron s hand  from yours  Sir  before ten thousand witnesses   Mr  Greville
