excusing or concealing facts of this nature from me at present ’  Here she added of herself  repeating it first aloud to me   ‘and I think the preference he has given me to her  now in her state of separation  is a convincing proof of this ’  An admirable argument   her vanity would not let her slip this observation    Proceed  madam   ‘The true reasons of my insinuations against her  were no other than that I could not bear to share your affections with any body’  and a very sufficient reason too  which a man that loves can easily forgive   ‘I knew  that so long as she gave you no cause of complaint  you were too just to withdraw your whole heart from her  and nothing but the whole would content me ’  Still you see you shew a great mind   True  said she  going on  but my reason for leaving him without apprizing him of it  what are we to say for that   Oh  nothing more easy to execute  he will admire you the more for the reason I shall give  Come   ‘My departing without first making you acquainted with my design  and going off with another person  may  at first sight     seem very strange  but  to tell you the real state of my heart  I found I could not trust to its firmness on the subject of parting with you  I loved you so  that it was with pain and grief I made the resolution  and I knew too well  that had you used any arguments  which to be sure you would have done  to dissuade me  I  like an easy fool  would have given up all my good designs ’  I am only afraid this will make him love you more than ever    She smiled as she continued to write   ‘As for the other article’— This I was more puzzled to excuse than the first  but  putting on a bold face  I said  Madam  I hope you will not condemn me here  while you excuse yourself  the saying you were run away with  will knock all the rest on the head  and he may chuse whether he will believe that you really intended to break off with him or not  therefore that particular had better not be touched upon  Well  said she  get me out of this scrape as cleverly as you have brought me into it  Fear not  said I  go on   ‘As for the other article  though I shall never love Mr Faulkland as I have done you  yet in him I have found a protector  and through his means  I hope to pass the remainder of my life  in a manner more suitable to a woman of a generous way of thinking  than that wherein she considered herself as encroaching on the rights of another  I hope  by this sacrifice which I have made of my love to a more heroic principle  that I shall expiate my former offence  and that you will follow my example so far as to make what reparation you can to the woman we have both injured ’  How this must raise  how exalt you in his opinion  I think it must  cried she  bridling up her head  as if they were really her own sentiments    I believe  said I  this is all that is necessary to be said  you may add  in a postscript  that  as he furnished the house for you at Ashby  every thing in it is at his service  together with your chariot and horses  which were also his gifts   She demurred to this  and in the midst of her heroics  said  I wish I could get somebody to sell them for me privately  and remit the money to me  for  since I am here  I should like to see a little more of France before I return   I told her that would look mean  and below a great mind  Well  said she  let them go  I owe all my servants a year’s wages  and another person about fifty pounds for a little temple he had just built in my garden  but not quite finished when I came away  I think I had better desire those debts to be discharged  I have always been very punctual in my dealings  and would not for the world wrong anybody     You are in the right  said I  it will look honourable in you to desire those debts to be paid   She now proceeded to conclude her letter in the same stile she had begun it  and added a postscript to the purport I mentioned  I hastened to make her seal it up  and direct it to Mr Arnold  at his house in London  who  I suppose  has had the pleasure of receiving it before now  for I dispatched it off directly  I flatter myself with the hope that it will have the desired effect on him   You will think perhaps  that  as I have managed it  I have really given her a sort of merit with him in the acknowlegement of her fault  and the pretended reason
