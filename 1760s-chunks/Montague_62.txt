himself to explain how  she has promised to live with us  We are going a party to Richmond  and only wait for Mr  Temple       With all my pertness  I tremble at the idea that to morrow will determine the happiness or misery of my life       Adieu  my dearest brother     LETTER XCVIII   98   To JOHN TEMPLE  Esq  Pall Mall   Quebec  March 21   WERE I convinced of your conversion  my dear Jack  I should be the happiest man breathing in the thought of your marrying my sister  but I tremble lest this resolution should be the effect of passion merely  and not of that settled esteem and tender confidence without which mutual repentance will be the necessary consequence of your connexion       Lucy is one of the most beautiful women I ever knew  but she has merits of a much superior kind  her understanding and her heart are equally lovely  she has also a sensibility which exceedingly alarms me for her  as I know it is next to impossible that even her charms can fix a heart so long accustomed to change       Do I not guess too truly  my dear Temple  when I suppose the charming mistress is the only object you have in view  and that the tender amiable friend  the pleasing companion  the faithful confidante  is forgot       I will not however anticipate evils  if any merit has power to fix you  Lucy s cannot fail of doing it       I expect with impatience a further account of an event in which my happiness is so extremely interested       If she is yours  may you know her value  and you cannot fail of being happy  I only fear from your long habit of improper attachments  naturally  I know not a heart filled with nobler sentiments than yours  nor is there on earth a man for whom I have equal esteem  Adieu   Your affectionate  ED  RIVERS     LETTER XCIX   99   To JOHN TEMPLE  Esq  Pall Mall   Quebec  March 23   I HAVE received your second letter  my dear Temple  with the account of your marriage       Nothing could make me so happy as an event which unites a sister I idolize to the friend on earth most dear to me  did I not tremble for your future happiness  from my perfect knowledge of both       I know the sensibility of Lucy s temper  and that she loves you  I know also the difficulty of weaning the heart from such a habit of inconstancy as you have unhappily acquired       Virtues like Lucy s will for ever command your esteem and friendship  but in marriage it is equally necessary to keep love alive  her beauty  her gaiety  her delicacy  will do much  but it is also necessary  my dearest Temple  that you keep a guard on your heart  accustomed to liberty  to give way to every light impression       I need not tell you  who have experienced the truth of what I say  that happiness is not to be found in a life of intrigue  there is no real pleasure in the possession of beauty without the heart  with it  the fears  the anxieties  a man not absolutely destitute of humanity must feel for the honor of her who ventures more than life for him  must extremely counterbalance his transports       Of all the situations this world affords  a marriage of choice gives the fairest prospect of happiness  without love  life would be a tasteless void  an unconnected human being is the most wretched of all creatures  by love I would be understood to mean that tender lively friendship  that mixed sensation  which the libertine never felt  and with which I flatter myself my amiable sister cannot fail of inspiring a heart naturally virtuous  however at present warped by a foolish compliance with the world       I hope  my dear Temple  to see you recover your taste for those pleasures peculiarly fitted to our natures  to see you enjoy the pure delights of peaceful domestic life  the calm social evening hour  the circle of friends  the prattling offspring  and the tender impassioned smile of real love       Your generosity is no more than I expected from your character  and to convince you of my perfect esteem  I so far accept it  as to draw out the money I have in the funds  which I intended for my sister  it will make my settlement here turn to greater advantage  and I allow you the pleasure of convincing Lucy of the perfect disinterestedness of your affection  it would be a trifle to you  and will make me happy       But I am more delicate in regard to my mother  and will never consent to resume the estate I have settled on her  I esteem you above all mankind  but will not let her be dependent even on you  I consent she visit you as often as she pleases  but insist on her continuing her house in town  and living in every respect as she has been accustomed       As to Lucy s own little fortune  as it is not worth your receiving
