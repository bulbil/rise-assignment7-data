credentials from the Inquisition at Lisbon  and behaved  with such resolution and reserve  that  after being released  I  was deemed a proper person to be employed in quality of a secret  intelligencer at a certain court  This office I undertook without  hesitation  and being furnished with money and bills of credit  crossed  the Pyrenees  with intention to revenge myself upon the Spaniards for  the severities I had undergone during my captivity    Having therefore effectually disguised myself by a change of dress  and  a large patch on one eye  I hired an equipage  and appeared at Bologna  in quality of an itinerant physician  in which capacity I succeeded  tolerably well  till my servants decamped in the night with my baggage   and left me in the condition of Adam  In short  I have travelled over  the greatest part of Europe  as a beggar  pilgrim  priest  soldier   gamester  and quack  and felt the extremes of indigence and opulence   with the inclemency of weather in all its vicissitudes  I have learned  that the characters of mankind are everywhere the same  that common  sense and honesty bear an infinitely small proportion to folly and vice   and that life is at best a paltry province    After having suffered innumerable hardships  dangers  and disgraces  I  returned to London  where I lived some years in a garret  and picked up  a subsistence  such as it was  by vending purges in the streets  from  the back of a pied horse  in which situation I used to harangue the mob  in broken English  under pretence of being an High German doctor    At last an uncle died  by whom I inherited an estate of three hundred  pounds per annum  though  in his lifetime  he would not have parted with  a sixpence to save my soul and body from perdition    I now appear in the world  not as a member of any community  or what  is called a social creature  but merely as a spectator  who entertains  himself with the grimaces of a jack pudding  and banquets his spleen in  beholding his enemies at loggerheads  That I may enjoy this disposition   abstracted from all interruption  danger  and participation  I feign  myself deaf  an expedient by which I not only avoid all disputes and  their consequences  but also become master of a thousand little secrets   which are every day whispered in my presence  without any suspicion of  their being overheard  You saw how I handled that shallow politician at  my Lady Plausible s the other day  The same method I practise upon the  crazed Tory  the bigot Whig  the sour  supercilious pedant  the petulant  critic  the blustering coward  the fawning fool  the pert imp  sly  sharper  and every other species of knaves and fools  with which this  kingdom abounds    In consequence of my rank and character  I obtain free admission to    6 22 15  3 45 PM   the ladies  among whom I have acquired the appellation of the Scandalous  Chronicle  As I am considered  while silent  in no other light than that  of a footstool or elbow chair  they divest their conversation of all  restraint before me  and gratify my sense of hearing with strange  things  which  if I could prevail upon myself to give the world that  satisfaction  would compose a curious piece of secret history  and  exhibit a quite different idea of characters from what is commonly  entertained    By this time  young gentleman  you may perceive that I have it in  my power to be a valuable correspondent  and that it will be to your  interest to deserve my confidence    Here the misanthrope left off speaking  desirous to know the sentiments  of our hero  who embraced the proffered alliance in a transport of joy  and surprise  and the treaty was no sooner concluded  than Mr  Crabtree  began to perform articles  by imparting to him a thousand delicious  secrets  from the possession of which he promised himself innumerable  scenes of mirth and enjoyment  By means of this associate  whom he  considered as the ring of Gyges  he foresaw  that he should be enabled  to penetrate  not only into the chambers  but even to the inmost  thoughts of the female sex  In order to ward off suspicion  they  agreed to revile each other in public  and meet at a certain private  rendezvous  to communicate their mutual discoveries  and concert their  future operations   But  soon after this agreement  our adventurer was summoned to the  garrison by an express from his friend Hatchway  representing that the  commodore lay at the point of death  and  in less than an hour after  the receipt of this melancholy piece of news  he set out post for his  uncle s habitation  having previously taken leave of Crabtree   who promised to meet him in two months in London  and settled a  correspondence with Gauntlet  who proposed to remain at Bath during
