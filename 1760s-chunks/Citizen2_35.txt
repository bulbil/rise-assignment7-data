 which is but about a thousand miles from thence  therefore he did go to China  therefore China was not peopled before he went there  therefore it was peopled by him  Besides  the Egyptians have pyramids  the Chinese have in like manner their porcelaine tower  the Egyptians used to light up candles upon every rejoicing  the Chinese have lanthorns upon the same occasion  the Egyptians had their great river  so have the Chinese  but what serves to put the matter past a doubt is  that the antient Kings of China and those of Egypt were called by the same names  The Emperor Ki is certainly the same with King Atoes  for  if we only change K into A  and i into toes  we shall have the name Atoes  and with equal ease Menes may be proved to be the same with the Emperor Yu  therefore the Chinese are a colony from Egypt   But another of the learned is entirely different from the last  and he will have the Chinese to be a colony planted by Noah just after the deluge  First  from the vast similitude there is between the name of Fohi  the founder of the Chinese monarchy  and that of Noah  the preserver of the human race  Noah  Fohi  very like each other truly  they have each but four letters  and only two of the four happen to differ  But to strengthen the argument  Fohi  as the Chinese chronicle asserts  had no father  Noah  it is true  had a father  as the European Bible tells us  but then  as this father was probably drowned in the flood  it is just the   106 same as if he had no father at all  therefore Noah and Fohi are the same  Just after the flood  the earth was covered with mud  if it was covered with mud  it must have been incrustated mud  if it was incrustated  it was cloathed with verdure  this was a fine  unembarrassed road for Noah to fly from his wicked children  he therefore did fly from them  and took a journey of two thousand miles for his own amusement  therefore Noah and Fohi are the same   Another sect of literati  for they all pass among the vulgar for very great scholars  assert  that the Chinese came neither from the colony of Sesostris  nor from Noah  but are descended from Magog  Meshec and Tubal  and therefore neither Sesostris  nor Noah  nor Fohi are the same   It is thus  my friend  that indolence assumes the airs of wisdom  and while it tosses the cup and ball with infantine folly  desires the world to look on  and calls the stupid pastime  philosophy and learning  Adieu   LETTER LXXXVII  From the same   WHEN the men of this country are once turned of thirty  they regularly retire every year at proper intervals to lie in of the spleen  The vulgar  unfurnished with the luxurious comforts of the soft cussion  down bed  and easy chair  are obliged when the fit is on them  to nurse it up by drinking  idleness and ill humour  In such   107 dispositions  unhappy is the foreigner who happens to cross them  his long chin  tarnished coat  or pinched hat  are sure to receive no quarter  If they meet no foreigner however to fight with  they are in such cases generally content with beating each other   The rich  as they have more sensibility  are operated upon with greater violence by this disorder  Different from the poor  instead of becoming more insolent  they grow totally unfit for opposition  A general here  who would have faced a culverin when well  if the fit be on him  shall hardly find courage to snuff a candle  An admiral  who could have opposed a broadside without shrinking  shall sit whole days in his chamber  mobbed up in double night caps  shuddering at the intrusive breeze  and distinguishable from his wife only by his black beard and heavy eyebrows   In the country this disorder mostly attacks the fair sex  in town it is most unfavourable to the men  A lady  who has pined whole years amidst cooing doves  and complaining nightingales in rural retirement  shall resume all her vivacity in one night at a city gaming table  her husband who roar d  hunted  and got drunk at home  shall grow splenetic in town in proportion to his wife s good humour  Upon their arrival in London  they exchange their disorders  In consequence of her parties and excursions  he puts on the furred cap and scarlet stomacher  and perfectly resembles an Indian husband  who when his wife is safely delivered  permits her to transact business abroad  while he undergoes all the formality of keeping his bed  and receiving all the condolence in her place     108But those who reside constantly in town  owe this disorder mostly to the influence of the weather  It is impossible to describe what a variety of transmutations an east wind shall produce  it has been known to change a Lady of fashion into a parlour couch  an Alderman into a plate of custards  and a dispenser of justice into a rat trap  Even Philosophers themselves are not exempt from
