to God I could see the day  master  when there shall  not be a priest  an exciseman  or a custom house officer in the kingdom   As for that fellow of a curate  if I do catch him  It don t signify  talking  But  by the Lord   Gentlemen  my service to you    The associates being satisfied  by these abrupt insinuations  that they  had so far succeeded in their aim  waited with impatience two or three  days in expectation of hearing that Tunley had fallen upon some method  of being revenged for this imaginary wrong  but finding that either his  invention was too shallow  or his inclination too languid  to gratify  their desire of his own accord  they determined to bring the affair to  such a crisis  that he should not be able to withstand the opportunity  of executing his vengeance  With this view  they one evening hired a boy  to run to Mr  Pickle s house  and tell the curate that Mrs  Tunley being  taken suddenly ill  her husband desired he would come immediately and  pray with her  They had taken possession of a room in the house and  Hatchway engaging the landlord in conversation  Peregrine  in his return  from the yard  observed  as if by accident  that the parson was gone    6 22 15  3 45 PM   into the kitchen  in order  as he supposed  to catechise Tunley s wife   The publican started at this intelligence  and  under pretence of  serving another company in the next room  went out to the barn  where   arming himself with a flail  he repaired to a lane through which the  curate was under a necessity of passing in his way home  There he lay  in ambush with fell intent  and when the supposed author of his shame  arrived  greeted him in the dark with such a salutation as forced him  to stagger backward three paces at least  If the second application had  taken effect  in all probability that spot would have been the  boundary of the parson s mortal peregrination  but luckily for him  his  antagonist was not expert in the management of his weapon  which  by a  twist of the thong that connected the legs  instead of pitching upon the  head of the astonished curate  descended in an oblique direction on  his own pate  with such a swing that the skull actually rang like an  apothecary s mortar  and ten thousand lights seemed to dance before his  eyes  The curate recollecting himself during the respite he obtained  from this accident  and believing his aggressor to be some thief who  lurked in that place for prey  resolved to make a running fight  until  he should arrive within cry of his habitation  With this design he  raised up his cudgel for the defence of his head  and  betaking himself  to his heels  began to roar for help with the lungs of a Stentor   Tunley  throwing away the flail  which he durst no longer trust with  the execution of his revenge  pursued the fugitive with all the speed he  could exert  and the other  either unnerved by fear or stumbling over  a stone  was overtaken before he had run a hundred paces  He no sooner  felt the wind of the publican s fist that whistled round his ears  than  he fell flat upon the earth at full length  and the cudgel flew from his  unclasping hand  when Tunley  springing like a tiger on his back  rained  such a shower of blows upon his carcase  that he imagined himself  under the discipline of ten pairs of fists at least  yet the imaginary  cuckold  not satisfied with annoying the priest in this manner  laid  hold of one of his ears with his teeth  and bit so unmercifully  that  the curate was found almost entranced with pain by two labourers  at  whose approach the assailant retreated unperceived   The lieutenant had posted himself at the window  in order to see the  landlord at his first return  and no sooner perceived him enter the  yard  than he called him into the apartment  impatient to learn the  effects of their stratagem  Tunley obeyed the summons  and appeared  before his guests in all the violence of rage  disorder  and fatigue   his nostrils were dilated more than one half beyond their natural  capacity  his eyes rolled  his teeth chattered  he snored in breathing  as if he had been oppressed by the nightmare  and streams of sweat  flowed down each side of his forehead   Peregrine  affecting to start at the approach of such an uncouth figure   asked if he had been with a spirit  upon which he answered  with great  vehemence   Spirit  No  no  master  I have had a roll and tumble with  the flesh  A dog  I ll teach him to come a caterwauling about my doors    Guessing from this reply  that his aim was accomplished  and curious to  know the particulars of the rencounter   Well
