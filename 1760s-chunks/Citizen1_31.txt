 the combinations formed against their state  and the weakness of the wall which every earthquake might overturn  While this altercation continued  the kingdom might be justly said to enjoy its greatest share of vigour  every order in the state  by being watchful over each other  contributed to diffuse happiness equally  and ballanced the state  The arts of peace flourished  nor were those of war neglected  the neighbouring powers  who had nothing to apprehend from the ambition of men whom they only saw solicitous not for riches but freedom  were contented to traffick with them  they sent their goods to be manufactured in Lao  and paid a large price for them upon their return     96By these means this people at length became moderately rich  and their opulence naturally invited the invader  a Tartar prince led an immense army against them  and they as bravely stood up in their own defence  they were still inspired with a love of their country  they fought the barbarous enemy with fortitude  and gained a complete victory   From this moment  which they regarded as the completion of their glory  historians date their down fall  They had risen in strength by a love of their country  and fell by indulging ambition  The country possessed by the invading Tartars  seemed to them a prize that would not only render them more formidable for the future  but which would encrease their opulence for the present  it was unanimously resolved  therefore  both by soldiers and artizans  that those desolate regions should be peopled by colonies from Lao  When a trading nation begins to act the conqueror  it is then perfectly undone  it subsists in some measure by the support of its neighbours  while they continue to regard it without envy or apprehension  trade may flourish  but when once it presumes to assert as its right what it only enjoyed as a favour  each country reclaims that part of commerce which it has power to take back  and turns it into some other channel more honourable  though perhaps less convenient   Every neighbour now began to regard with jealous eyes this ambitious common wealth  and forbade their subjects any future intercourse with them  The inhabitants of Lao  however  still pursued the same ambitious maxims  it was from   97 their colonies alone they expected riches  and riches  said they  are strength  and strength is security  Numberless were the migrations of the desperate and enterprizing of this country to people the desolate dominions lately possessed by the Tartar  between these colonies and the mother country  a very advantageous traffic was at first carried on  the republic sent their colonies large quantities of the manufactures of the country  and they in return provided the republic with an equivalent in ivory and ginseng  By this means the inhabitants became immensely rich  and this produced an equal degree of voluptuousness  for men who have much money will always find some fantastical modes of enjoyment  How shall I mark the steps by which they declined  Every colony in process of time spreads over the whole country where it first was planted  As it grows more populous  it becomes more polite  and those manufactures for which it was in the beginning obliged to others  it learns to dress up itself  such was the case with the colonies of Lao  they in less than a century became a powerful and a polite people  and the more polite they grew  the less advantageous was the commerce which still subsisted between them and others  By this means the mother country being abridged in its commerce grew poorer but not less luxurious  Their former wealth had introduced luxury  and whereever luxury once fixes  no art can either lessen or remove it Their commerce with their neighbours was totally destroyed  and that with their colonies was every day naturally and necessarily declining  they still  however  preserved the insolence of wealth  without a power to support it  and persevered in being luxurious while contemptible   98 from poverty  In short  the state resembled one of those bodies bloated with disease  whose bulk is only a symptom of its wretchedness  Their former opulence only rendered them more impotent  as those individuals who are reduced from riches to poverty  are of all men the most unfortunate and helpless They had imagined  because their colonies tended to make them rich upon the first acquisition  they would still continue to do so  they now found however  that on themselves alone they should have depended for support  that colonies ever afford but temporary affluence  and when cultivated and polite are no longer useful  From such a concurrence of circumstances they soon became contemptible  The emperor Honti invaded them with a powerful army  Historians do not say whether their colonies were too remote to lend assistance  or else were desirous of shaking off their dependance  But certain it is  they scarce made any resistance  their walls were now found but a weak defence  and they at length were obliged to acknowledge subjection to the empire of China   Happy  very happy might they have been  had they known when to bound their riches and their glory  Had they known that extending empire is often diminishing power  that countries are ever strongest which are internally powerful  that colonies by draining away the brave and enterprizing  leave the country in
