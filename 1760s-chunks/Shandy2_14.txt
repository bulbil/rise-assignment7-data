to hurt any man —a brother worse —but to hurt a brother of such gentle manners —so unprovoking —and so unresenting — tis base —By heaven   tis cowardly —You are heartily welcome  brother  quoth my uncle Toby —had it been fifty times as much —Besides  what have I to do  my dear Toby  cried my father  either with your amusements or your pleasures  unless it was in my power  which it is not  to increase their measure   —Brother Shandy  answer d my uncle Toby  looking wistfully in his face —you are much mistaken in this point —for you do increase my pleasure very much  in begetting children for the Shandy family at your time of life —But  by that  Sir  quoth Dr  Slop  Mr  Shandy increases    his own —Not a jot  quoth my father   CHAP  XIII   MY brother  does it  quoth my uncle Toby  out of principle —In a family way  I suppose  quoth Dr  Slop —Pshaw —said my father — tis not worth talking of   CHAP  XIV   AT the end of the last chapter  my father and my uncle Toby were left both standing  like Brutus and Cassius at the close of the scene making up their accounts     As my father spoke the three last words —he sat down —my uncle Toby exactly followed his example  only  that before he took his chair  he rung the bell  to order Corporal Trim  who was in waiting  to step home for Stevinus —my uncle Toby s house being no further off than the opposite side of the way   Some men would have dropp d the subject of Stevinus —but my uncle Toby had no resentment in his heart  and he went on with the subject  to shew my father that he had none   Your sudden appearance  Dr  Slop  quoth my uncle  resuming the discourse  instantly brought Stevinus into my head   My father  you may be sure  did not offer to lay any more wagers upon Stevinus s head —Because  continued my    uncle Toby  the celebrated sailing chariot  which belonged to Prince Maurice  and was of such wonderful contrivance and velocity  as to carry half a dozen people thirty German miles  in I don t know how few minutes —was invented by Stevinus  that great mathematician and engineer   You might have spared your servant the trouble  quoth Dr  Slop  as the fellow is lame  of going for Stevinus s account of it  because  in my return from Leyden thro  the Hague  I walked as far as Schevling  which is two long miles  on purpose to take a view of it   —That s nothing  replied my uncle Toby  to what the learned Peireskius did  who walked a matter of five hundred miles  reckoning from Paris toSchevling     and from Schevling to Paris back again  in order to see it —and nothing else   Some men cannot bear to be out gone   The more fool Peireskius  replied Dr  Slop  But mark   twas out of no contempt of Peireskius at all —but that Peireskius s indefatigable labour in trudging so far on foot out of love for the sciences  reduced the exploit of Dr  Slop  in that affair  to nothing —the more fool Peireskius  said he again —Why so —replied my father  taking his brother s part  not only to make reparation as fast as he could for the insult he had given him  which sat still upon my father s mind —but partly  that my father began really to interest himself in the discourse —Why so —said he  Why is Peireskius or any man else  to be abused for an appetite    for that  or any other morsel of sound knowledge  For  notwithstanding I know nothing of the chariot in question  continued he  the inventor of it must have had a very mechanical head  and tho  I cannot guess upon what principles of philosophy he has atchiev d it —yet certainly his machine has been constructed upon solid ones  be they what they will  or it could not have answer d at the rate my brother mentions   It answered  replied my uncle Toby  as well  if not better  for  as Peireskius elegantly expresses it  speaking of the velocity of its motion  Tam citus erat  quam erat ventus  which  unless I have forgot my Latin  is  that it was as swift as the wind itself     But pray  Dr  Slop  quoth my father  interrupting my uncle  tho  not without begging pardon for it  at the same time  upon what principles was this selfsame chariot set a going —Upon very pretty principles to be sure  replied Dr  Slop —and I have often wondered  continued he  evading the question  why none of our gentry  who live upon large plains like this of ours — especially they whose wives are not past child bearing  attempt nothing of this kind  for it would not only be infinitely expeditious upon sudden calls  to which the sex is subject —if the wind only served —but would be excellent good husbandry to make use of the winds
