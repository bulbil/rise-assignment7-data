his Understanding  yet I admired his Figure  I was certain he was a Fool  yet I could not help loving him  Men of many Words may reconcile this Paradox  all I can say  is  I felt it to be true   When I retired to my Chamber  I found a thousand Excuses for his Behaviour  I recollected an Intimacy  a very particular one  between this Gentleman  and the Person who pass d for his Valet  they dressed much alike  they were not unlike in Figure  The Valet never sorted with the rest of the Servants  and several Expressions his Master made use of to him  made me conclude  that this Servant was some young Lady  whom he had stole from a Nunnery — I had often read of such Things  and that it was owing to this Connection  he seemed so averse to Marriage   Lovers  Sir  altho  they may be mistaken in Point of Judgment  are generally very quick sighted  at least  so we are apt to flatter ourselves  As soon as   88I had made this Discovery  I enjoyed greatly my Penetration  I exulted on the Sagacity I fansied myself possessed of  I pitied the young Lady  wanted sadly to hear her Story  and resolved generously to make a Sacrifice of my Passion to my Rival   With this noble Disposition I went to sleep—Pity  indeed  we cannot be so dispassionate  or irresolute  as we wish to be  All my fine Flights of Disinterestedness vanished in the Morning  and  as soon as I saw the Valet  I wished the Creature out of the House   That very Afternoon  as I was in my Dressing room  I heard in an adjoining Chamber Lady Veltry s Son  and his Valet  a Division in the Wainscot gave me an Opportunity of seeing them without their discovering it  I could not resist the Temptation of looking thro  the Crevice  there I saw them embrace each other with vast Fondness  my Conjectures were then past doubt  but  good God — in a few Minutes after  excuse me  Sir   turning my Face away  I found the Wretches to be both of the same Sex  Shocked and trembling I hurried out of the Room  rushed down Stairs  and  at the Bottom  I fell into a fainting Fit  One of our Servants luckily crossing the   89Hall at that Moment  recovered me  Too detestable is this Subject to dwell upon  I told what I had seen  and the Pair of Catamites were seized  When Lady Veltry s Son came before her Ladyship —so far from being daunted at the Discovery  he gloried in it  pronounced it superb Taste  and pretended to vindicate himself  by vast Fashion  and high Examples   Lady Veltry would not hear him proceed  ordered him out of her Sight  took to her Bed immediately  and  in four Days Time  without ever suffering her Son to come near her  died in my Arms —But here the Lady was interrupted by the following Accident   CHAP  XI   AFTER the Departure of Junior from the chief Constable s  Madam Illicit  whose Penetration could never enough be admired  discovered they had affronted a Lord  and that as how they mought be all ruined  supposing he had a Mind to sue them for Scrambulum matum     90Scandalum magnatum  you mean  my Dear  her Spouse replied  very good naturedly  but sometimes it is unlucky to set Folks right  She began upon her Husband  saying  it was all his doing  by following of his Whores and Strumpets  Had not Mr  Illicit very prudently left the Room  upon the first Prognostic of the approaching Tempest  it might have been of fatal Consequence  fatal at least to every Thing brittle about the Room  Madam Illicit being one of the best tempered Women in the World  but rather too hot  and she would in her Heat of Passion throw any Thing that came in her Way—but then it was soon over  and she was very sorry for it afterwards  as indeed all hasty People generally are  Her Anger was ended the Moment her Spouse made his Retreat  She begged her Brother s Pardon for being in a Passion—but vowed she would  for her own Family s Sake  go and wait upon my Lord s Lady  for Fear worse should come on t   Mr  Oatley approved her Intention   But  first  she strictly enjoined her Brother to Secresy concerning the whole Affair  Herein imitating some of the mighty Men  who make Laws—not for themselves indeed  they act ad Libitum   91Thus this Lady  tho  she positively insisted upon her Brother s not opening his Lips about it  yet she could not help calling at three or four Neighbours Houses  to let them know what a Blunderbuss her Husband had been  and as how my Lord knew her the Moment she came into the Room  and that she was sent for to drink Tea with his Lordship and the Lady  and that she knew who the Lady was  and all about her—but  thank God  she was no Blab  and how if it hadn t been for her knowing my Lord  my Lord would have ruined
