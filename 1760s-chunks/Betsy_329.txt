arrive which   was to put an end to that cruel constraint her charming lover had been   so longer under  and  while it gave him leave to declare the whole   fervency of the passion he was possessed of  allowed her also to confess   her own without a blush       Mr  Trueworth  who had kept an exact account of the time  contrived it   so that a letter from him should reach her hands the very next day after   that in which she was to throw off her mourning weeds  It was in these   terms he now wrote             To Mrs  Munden            Madam            The year of my probation is expired  I have now fully performed the        painful penance you enjoined  and you must expect me shortly at        your feet  to claim that recompence which my submission has in some        measure merited  You cannot now  without an injustice contrary to        your nature  forbid me to approach you with my vows of everlasting        love  nor any longer restrain my impatient lips from uttering the        languishments of my adoring heart  nor can I now content myself        with telling you  at the distance of so many miles  how very dear        you are to me  No  you must also read the tender declarations in my        eyes  and hear it in my sighs  The laws of tyrant custom have been        fulfilled in their most rigorous forms  and those of gentler love         may  sure  demand an equal share in our obedience  Fain would my        flattering hopes persuade me that I shall not find you a too        stubborn rebel to that power  to whose authority all nature yields        a willing homage  and that my happiness is a thing of some        consequence to you  If I am too presuming  at least forgive me  but        let your pen assure me you do so by the return of the post  till        when I am  with a mixture of transport and anxiety  Madam  your        passionately devoted  and most faithful adorer            C  TRUEWORTH        Though this was no more than Mrs  Munden had expected  it diffused   through her whole frame a glow of satisfaction unknown to those who do   not love as she did  she thought  indeed  as well as he  that there was   no need of continuing that cruel constraint she so long had imposed upon   herself  and hesitated not if she should acknowledge what he before had   not the least cause to doubt  The terms in which she expressed herself   were these             To Charles Trueworth  Esq            Sir            I know there is a great share of impatience in the composition of        your sex  and wonder not at yours  much less have I any pretence to        excuse you of presumption  as you are too well acquainted with the        just sensibility I have of your merits not to expect all the marks        of it that an honourable passion can require  An attempt to conceal        my heart from you will be vain  you saw the inmost recesses of it        at a time when you should most have been a stranger there  but what        was then my shame to have discovered  is now my glory to avow  and        I scruple not to confess  that whatever makes your happiness will        confirm mine  But I must stop here  or  when I see you  shall have        nothing left to add in return for the pains so long a journey will        cost you  Let no anxieties  however  render the way more tedious         but reflect that every step will bring you still nearer to a        reception equal to your wishes  from her who is  with an unfeigned        sincerity
