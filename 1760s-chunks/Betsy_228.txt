accompany you in        seeing me laid in the earth  I know your gentle  generous nature         too well  to doubt you will deny me this request  and the very idea        that you will ask  and he will grant  gives  methinks  a new vigour        to my enfeebled spirits  O if some departed souls are permitted  as        some say they are  to look down on what passes beneath the moon         how will mine triumph  how exult to see my poor remains thus        honoured  thus attended  I can no more but this  may you make happy        the best of men  and may he make you the happiest of women         Farewel  enternally farewel  be assured  that I as lived  so I die         with the greatest sincerity  dear Miss Harriot  yours   c            J  BLANCHFIELD            P S  Be so good to give my last adieus to Mrs  Wellair  she will        find I have not forgot her  nor my little godson  in my bequests        How would the vain unthinking sop have exulted on such a proof of his   imagined merit  how would the sordid avaricious man  in the pleasure of   finding so unexpected an accession to his wealth  have forgot all   compassion for the hand that gave it  Mr  Trueworth  on the contrary    blushed at having so much more ascribed to him than he would allow   himself to think he deserved  and would gladly have been deprived of the   best part of his fortune  rather than have received an addition to it by   such fatal means       The accident  however  was so astonishing to him  that he scarce   believed it real  nor could what he read in the letter under her own   hand  nor all Mrs  Wellair and Miss Harriot alledged  persuade him to   think  at least to acknowledge  that the lady s death was owing to a   hopeless flame for him       While they were speaking  Sir Bazil came in  he had been at home when   his sister received the letter  and had heard what Lucy said of her   mistress s indisposition  and was therefore no stranger to any part of   the affair        Well  Trueworth   said he to that gentleman   I have often endeavoured   to emulate  and have even envied  the great talents you are master of    but am now reconciled to nature for not bestowing them on me  lest they   might prove of the same ill consequences to some women  as yours have   been to Mrs  Blanchfield         Dear Sir Bazil   replied Mr  Trueworth   do not attempt to force me   into an imagination which would render me at once both vain and   wretched  Chance might direct the partial inclination of this lady to   have kinder thoughts of me  than I could either merit or return  but I   should be loth to believe that they have produced the sad event we now   lament         I am of opinion  indeed   said Sir Bazil   that there are many who   deceive themselves  as well as the world  in this point  People are apt   to mistake that for love  which is only the effect of pride  for a   disappointment  but it would be unjust to suppose this was the case with   Mrs  Blanchfield  the generous legacy she has bequeathed to you  and the   tenderness with which she treats my sister  leaves no room to suspect   her soul was tainted with any of those turbulent emotions  which   disgrace the name of love  and yet are looked upon as the consequence of   that passion  she knew no jealousy  harboured no revenge  the affection   she had for you was simple and sincere  and  meeting no return  preyed   only upon herself and by degrees consumed the springs of life         I am glad  however   said the elder sister of Sir Bazil   to find that   Mr  Trueworth has nothing to reproach himself with on this unhappy   score  some men  on receiving a letter of the nature he did  would    through mere curiosity of knowing on whose account it came  have sent an   answer of encouragement  it must be owned  therefore  that the command   he
