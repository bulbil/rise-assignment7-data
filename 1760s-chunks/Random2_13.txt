  I drag the parent by the hoary hair    And toss the sprawling infant on my spear    While the fond mother s cries regale mine ear    I fight  I vanquish  murder friends and foes    Nor dare th immortal gods my rage oppose      Though I did great violence to my understanding in praising this unnatural rhapsody  I nevertheless extolled it as a production that of itself deserved immortal fame  and beseeched her ladyship to bless the world with the fruits of those uncommon talents heaven had bestowed upon her —She smiled with a look of self complacency  and encouraged by the incense I had offered  communicated all her poetical works  which I applauded one by one  with as little candour as I had shewn at first —Satiated with my flattery  which I hope my situation justified  she could not in conscience refuse me an opportunity of shining in my turn  and therefore  after a compliment to my nice discernment and taste  observed  that doubtless I must have produced something in that way myself  which she desired to see —This was a temptation I could by no means resist —I owned that while I was at   31 college  I wrote some small detached pieces  at the desire of a friend who was in love  and at her request  repeated the following verses  which indeed my love for Narcissa had inspired    On Celia playing on the harpsicord and singing   I   When Sapho struck the quiv ring wire   The throbbing breast was all on fire   And when she rais d the vocal lay   The captive soul was charm d away   II   But had the nymph  possess d with these  Thy softer  chaster pow r to please   Thy beauteous air of sprightly youth   Thy native smiles of artless truth   III   The worm of grief  had never prey d  On the forsaken  love sick maid   Nor had she mourn d an happless flame   Nor dash d on rocks her tender frame     My mistress paid me a cold compliment on the versification  which  she said  was elegant enough  but the subject beneath the pen of a true poet  I was extremely nettled at her indifference  and looked at Narcissas  who by this time had joined us  for her approbation  but she declined giving her opinion  protesting she was no judge of these matters  So that I was forced to retire    32 very much baulked in my expectation  which was generally a little too sanguine —In the afternoon  however  the waiting maid assured me  that Narcissa had expressed her approbation of my performance with great warmth  and desired her to procure a copy of it  as for herself  that she  Narcissa  might have an opportunity to peruse it at leisure —I was elated to an extravagant pitch at this intelligence  and immediately transcribed a fair copy of my Ode  which was carried to the dear charmer  together with another on the same subject  as follows   I   Thy fatal shafts unerring move   I bow before thine altar  love   I feel thy soft  resistless flame  Glide swift through all my vital frame   II   For while I gaze my bosom glows   My blood in tides impetuous flows   Hope  fear and joy alternate roll   And floods of transports  whelm my soul   III   My fault ring tongue attempts in vain  In soothing murmurs to complain   My tongue some secret magick ties   My murmurs sink in broken sighs   IV   Condemn d to nurse eternal care   And ever drop the silent tear   Unheard I mourn  unknown I sigh   Unfriended live  unpitied die       33 Whether or not Narcissa discovered my passion  I could not learn from her behaviour  which  though always benevolent to me  was henceforth more reserved and less chearful —While my thoughts aspired to a sphere so far above me  I had unwittingly made a conquest of the cookwench and dairy maid  who became so jealous of one another  that if their sentiments had been refined by education  it is probable one or other of them would have had recourse to poison or steel  to be revenged of her rival  but as their minds were happily adapted to their humble station  their mutual enmity was confined to scolding and fifty cuffs  in which exercises they were both well skilled —My good fortune did not long remain a secret  being disclosed by the frequent broils of these heroines  who kept no decorum in their encounters  The coachman and gardiner  who paid their devoirs to my admirers  each to his respective choice  alarmed at my success  laid their heads together  in order to concert a plan of revenge  and the former having been educated at the academy of Tottenham court  undertook to challenge me to single combat  he accordingly  with many opprobrious invectives  bid me defiance  and offered to box with me for twenty guineas —I told him  that although I believed myself a match for him  even at that work  I would not
