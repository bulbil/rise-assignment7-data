 and  in the confidence of his honour  consented  to be one of a party that made an excursion as far as Windsor  thinking  herself secured from scandal by the company of another young lady   who had also condescended to trust her person to the protection of her  admirer  The two gallants  in the course of this expedition  were said  to use the most perfidious means to intoxicate the passions of their  mistresses by mixing drugs with their wine  which inflamed their  constitutions to such a degree  that they fell an easy sacrifice to the  appetites of their conductors  who  upon their return to town  were so    6 22 15  3 45 PM   base and inhuman as to boast among their companions of the exploit they  had achieved  Thus the story was circulated  with a thousand additional  circumstances to the prejudice of the sufferers  one of whom had thought  proper to withdraw into the country  until the scandal raised at her  expense should subside  while the other  who was not so easily put  out of countenance  resolved to outface the report  as a treacherous  aspersion  invented by her lover as an excuse for his own inconstancy   and actually appeared in public  as usual  till she found herself  neglected by the greatest part of her acquaintance   In consequence of this disgrace  which she knew not whether to impute to  the card affair  or to the last faux pas she had committed  she now came  to consult the conjurer  and signified her errand  by asking whether  the cause of her present disquiet was of the town or the country   Cadwallader at once perceiving her allusion  answered her question  in these terms   This honest world will forgive a young gamester for  indiscretion at play  but a favour granted to a babbling coxcomb is  an unpardonable offence   This response she received with equal  astonishment and chagrin  and  fully convinced of the necromancer s  omniscience  implored his advice  touching the retrieval of her  reputation  upon which he counselled her to wed with the first  opportunity  She seemed so well pleased with his admonition  that she  gratified him with a double fee  and  dropping a low curtsey  retired   Our undertakers now thought it high time to silence the oracle for the  day  and Hadgi was accordingly ordered to exclude all comers  while  Peregrine and his friend renewed the deliberations which had been  interrupted  and settled a plan of operations for the next occasion   Meanwhile it was resolved that Hadgi should not only exercise his  own talents  but also employ inferior agents  in procuring general  intelligence for the support of their scheme  that the expense of this  ministry should be defrayed from the profits of their professions  and  the remainder be distributed to poor families in distress   CHAPTER LXXXIII   Peregrine and his friend Cadwallader proceed in the Exercise of the  Mystery of Fortune telling  in the course of which they achieve various  Adventures   These preliminaries being adjusted  our hero forthwith repaired to a  card assembly  which was frequented by some of the most notable gossips  in town  and  having artfully turned the conversation upon the subject  of the fortune teller  whose talents he pretended to ridicule  incensed  their itch of knowing secrets to such a degree of impatience  that their  curiosity became flagrant  and he took it for granted  that all or some  of them would visit Albumazar on his very first visiting day  While  Peregrine was thus engaged  his associate made his appearance in another  convocation of fashionable people  where he soon had the pleasure of  hearing the conjurer brought upon the carpet by an elderly gentlewoman   remarkable for her inquisitive disposition  who  addressing herself  to Cadwallader  asked  by the help of the finger alphabet  if he knew    6 22 15  3 45 PM   anything of the magician that made such a noise in town  The misanthrope  answered  as usual  in a surly tone   By your question you must either  take me for a pimp or an idiot  What  in the name of nonsense  should  I know of such a rascal  unless I were to court his acquaintance with a  view to feast my own spleen  in seeing him fool the whole nation out  of their money  Though  I suppose  his chief profits arise from his  practice  in quality of pander  All fortune tellers are bawds  and  for  that reason  are so much followed by people of fashion  This fellow   I warrant  has got sundry convenient apartments for the benefit of  procreation  for it is not to be supposed that those who visit him on  the pretence of consulting his supernatural art  can be such fools   such drivellers  as to believe that he can actually prognosticate future  events    The company  according to his expectation  imputed his remarks to the  rancour of his disposition  which could not bear to think that any  person upon earth was wiser than
