 so peace seemed to have been that of the Tories  Through the course of English history  France seems to have been the peculiar object of the hatred of the Whigs  and a continual war with that nation has been their aim  On the contrary  the Tories have not regarded that nation  with such opposition of principle  and a peace with France has generally been the result of a Tory administration  For some time therefore  a negotiation for peace had been carried on between the court of France and the new ministers  who had a double aim in this measure  namely  to mortify the Whigs and the Dutch  and to free their country from a ruinous war which had all the appearance of becoming habitual to the constitution   I am   c     107  LETTER XIII   THE conferences for peace were first opened at London  and some time after the Queen sent the Earl of Strafford as ambassador into Holland  to communicate the proposals which the French King had made towards the re establishment of the general tranquility  The spirit of the times was now changed  Marlborough s aversion to such measures could now no longer retard the negotiation  Lord Strafford obliged the Dutch to name plenipotentiaries  and to receive those of France  The treaty began at Utrecht  but as all the powers concerned in this conference  except France and England  were averse to every accommodation  their disputes served rather to retard than accelerate a pacification  The English ministry  however  had foreseen and provided against those difficulties  Their great end was to free the subjects from a long unprofitable war  a war where conquest could add nothing to their power  and a defeat might be prejudicial to internal tranquility  As England had borne the chief burthen of the war  it was but just to expect that it would take the lead in dictating the terms of peace  There were  however  three persons of very great interest and power  who laboured  by every art  to protract the negotiation  those were the Duke of Marlborough  Prince Eugene  and Heinsius the Dutch grand pensionary  Prince Eugene even came over to London  in order to retard the progress of a peace  which seemed to interrupt his career of glory  he found at court such a reception as was due to his merits and fame  but  at the same time  such a repulse as the proposals he made seemed to deserve   This negotiation to London failing of effect  the allies practised every artifice to intimidate the Queen  and blacken the character of her ministers  to raise   108 and continue a dangerous ferment among the people  to obstruct her councils  and divulge her designs  Her ministers were very sensible of their present dangerous situation  they perceived her health was daily impairing  and her successor countenanced the opposite faction  In case of her death  they had nothing to expect but prosecution and ruin  for obeying her commands  their only way therefore was to give up their present employments  or hasten the conclusion of a treaty  the utility of which would be the best argument with the people in their favour  The peace therefore was hastened  and this haste  in some measure  relaxed the ministers obstinacy  in insisting upon such terms and advantages as they had a right to demand  Seeing that nothing was to be expected from the concurrence of the allies  the courts of London and Versailles resolved to enter into a private treaty  in which such terms might be agreed on as would enable both courts to prescribe terms to the rest of the contending powers   In the mean time the Duke of Marlborough having been deposed from his office of general  the command of the English army in Flanders was given to the Duke of Ormond  but  at the same time  private orders were given him not to act with vigour against an enemy  which was upon the point of being reconciled by more mild methods of treatment  The allies  thus deprived of the assistance of the English  still continued their animosity  and were resolved to continue the war separately  they had the utmost confidence in Prince Eugene  their general  and  though lessened by the defection of the British forces  they were still superior to those of the enemy  which were commanded by Marshal Villars  a man who seemed to possess all the great qualities  and all the soibles of his country  in a supreme degree  valiant  generous  alert  lively  boastful  and avaricious  The loss of the British forces was soon severely felt in the   109 allied army  Villars attacked a separate body of their troops incamped at Denain  under the command of the Earl of Albemarle  Their intrenchments were forced  and seventeen battalions either killed or taken  the Earl himself  and all the surviving officers  being made prisoners of war   These successes of Marshal Villars served to hasten the treaty of Utrecht  The British ministers at the congress  responsible at once for their conduct to their Queen  their country  and all Europe  neglected nothing that might have been serviceable either to the allies  or that might conduce to the public safety  They first stipulated that Philip V  who had been settled on the throne of Spain
