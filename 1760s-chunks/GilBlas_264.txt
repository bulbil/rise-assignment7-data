of prying neighbours  not to pay his visits till after night fall  and then in the most private manner possible  Hereupon I magnified you as the properest gentleman in the world  and intreated piety in pattens to offer your humble services to the ladies  She promised to do so  and to bring me back my answer to morrow morning at an appointed place  That is all very well  answered I  but I am afraid your goddess of bed  making has been running her rig upon you  No  no  replied he  old birds are not to be caught with chaff  I have already made inquiry in the neighbourhood  and by the general report of her  Signora Catalina is a second Danae  on whom you will have the happiness of coming down   Like Jove descending from his tower  To court her in a silver shower   Out of conceit as I was with the intrinsic value of ladies  favours  this was not to be scoffed at  and as our Mercury in petticoats came the next day to tell Scipio that it only depended on me to be introduced that very evening  I dropped in between eleven and twelve o clock  The knowing one received me without bringing a candle  and led me by the hand into a very neat apartment  where the two ladies were sitting on a satin sofa  dressed in the most elegant taste  As soon as they saw me enter  they got up and welcomed me in a style of such superior breeding  as would not have disgraced the highest rank  The aunt  whose name was Signora Mencia  though with the remains of beauty  had no attractions for me  But the niece had a million  for she was a goddess in mortal form  And yet  to examine her critically  she could not have been admitted for a perfect beauty  but then there was a charm above all rules of symmetry  with a tingling and luxurious warmth about her  that seized on men s hearts through their eyes  and prevented their brains from being too busy   Neither were my senses proof against so dazzling a display  I forgot my errand as proxy  and spoke on my own private individual account  with the enthusiasm of a raw recruit in the tender passion  The dear little creature  whose wit sounded in my ears with three times its actual acuteness  under favour of her natural endowments  made a complete conquest of me by her prattle  I began to launch out into foolish raptures  when the aunt  to bring me to my bearings  led the conversation to the point in hand  Signor de Santillane  I shall deal very explicitly with you  On the high encomiums I have heard of your character  you have been admitted here  without the affectation of making much ado about trifles  but do not imagine that your views are the nearer their termination for that  Hitherto I have brought my niece up in retirement  and you are  as it were  the very first male creature on whom she has ever set eyes  If you deem her worthy of being your wife  I shall feel myself highly honoured by the alliance  it is for you to consider whether those terms suit you  but you cannot have her on cheaper   This was proceeding to business with a vengeance  It put little Cupid to flight at once  or else he was just going to try one of his sharpest arrows upon me  But a truce with the Pantheon  A marriage so bluntly proposed dispelled the fairy vision  I sunk back at once into the count s plodding agent  and changing my tone  answered Signora Mencia thus  Madam  your frankness delights me  and I will meet it half way  Whatever rank I may hold at court  lower than the highest is too low for the peerless Catalina  A far more brilliant offer waits her acceptance  the Prince of Spain shall be thrown into her toils  Surely it was enough to have refused my niece  replied the aunt sarcastically  such compliments are sufficiently unpleasing to our sex  it could not be necessary to make us your unfeeling sport  I really am not in so merry a mood  madam  exclaimed I  it is a plain matter of fact  I am commissioned to look out for a young lady of merit sufficient to engage the prince s heart  and receive his private visits  the object of my search is in your house  and here his royal highness shall fix his quarters   Signora Mencia could scarcely believe her cars  neither were they grievously offended  Nevertheless  thinking it decent to be startled at the immorality of the proceeding  she replied to the following effect  Though I should give implicit credit to what you tell me  you must understand that I am not of a character to take pleasure in the infamous distinction of seeing my niece a prince s concubine  Every feeling of virtue and of honour revolts at the idea         What a simpleton you are with your virtue and honour  interrupted I  You have not a notion above the level of a tradesman s wife  Was there ever anything so stupid as to consider affairs of this kind with a view to their moral tendency  It
