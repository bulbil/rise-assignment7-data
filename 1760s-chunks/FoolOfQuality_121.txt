you to keep these things from their lawful owners for the very   long space of twelve months and upwards  Why did you not   immediately  or long before now  give informations against those   whom you so suddenly take it into your head to accuse   And why   would you suffer that so exceeding chaste and innocent lady to         106 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      labour  all this time  under the infamy with which her character    in my judgment  is still justly loaded       To all these questions Mr  Longfield barely smiled   but bowing   with his head  and making a motion with his hand to two gentlemen   who sat on one side of the bench  Mr  Archibald  an eminent   merchant and an alderman of the city  got up and spoke to the   following effect       I wish  my lord  that I could as well content your lordship  as I   can satisfy the jury and all others present on the articles you   require  The day immediately succeeding this fatal accident    Mr  Longfield came to me  and  in the presence of Mr  Truelove here    my worthy and substantial neighbour  gave a detail  almost word   for word  of all that he has this hour deposed in court   he then   deposited the watch and snuff box with us  and did not reclaim   them till early this morning  As I am of his majesty s peace  he   also gave in this examination before me  which however I must not   venture to hand over to your lordship  till I have your previous   engagement that you will not tear it  I therefore offered to issue   warrants for apprehending the delinquents   but Mr  Longfield   most sensibly and judiciously observed  that such a step must   unquestionably shut the door against justice and all knowledge of   the truth  that the criminals were two to one against their accuser    that  on the slightest alarm  they would infallibly abscond or make   away with the effects  of which they now held themselves the peace    able and unquestioned possessors  or contrive some further plot to   invalidate his evidence   or  probably  make him away by pistol or   poison  and so deprive that unhappy gentlewoman of the only wit    ness of her innocence  But  says he  if they are permitted to enter   the court under the confidence of my confederacy  they will have   no reserve upon them  no foreformed evasions or contrivances for   escape  My unexpected testimony will suddenly confound their   guilt  and they may happen to carry some articles about them which   might serve for their conviction beyond ten witnesses      In the mean time  Mr  Longfield  Mr  Truelove  and I were   solicitous and unwearied in our inquiries after the unfortunate   prisoner  that we might persuade her to stand her trial  and to   deliver herself up to justice  But all our search proved fruitless   till the day on which she was discovered and taken      Here Mr  Archibald ended  and the judge exclaimed Crier    call the two first witnesses into court  that we may hear what they   say to this fair weather speech  The crier accordingly vociferated   several Oyez s for Deborah Skinner and Robert Callan to come   into court  But  had they been within call  they did not choose to   hear  During the attention of the court and jury to alderman   Archibald  they had imperceptibly slipped behind their next   neighbours   and proceeding in like manner from one to another    they at length confounded themselves with the crowd  and got   clear off      My lord then began to sum his charge to the jury  and dwelled   with much emphasis on some articles  Here  says he  we have   lost a nobleman a minister one of the first ornaments of our   country and stays of our land  And what  I pray ye  have we         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  107     pot in recompense of this great damage  Why  my friends  we   have got a new thing upon the earth   we have got a saving of the   honour of a milliner  But if this woman is inviolate  as still is   pretended  how came she to be guilty of this most horrid of all   murders  before she knew to what extremity his lordship would   have proceeded  How did she dare capitally to execute a peer   of the realm  on that for which our laws would not have confined   a common porter   This woman must  certainly  have been a trader   in blood   and
