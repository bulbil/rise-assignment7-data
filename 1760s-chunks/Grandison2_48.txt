 my dear  that we are   119 above speaking slightly  because of our uncertainty  of a man that all the world praises  Nor are you  child  so weak as to be treated with such poor policy   You were not educated  my dear  in artifice  Disguises never sat so ill upon any woman  as they do  in most of your late letters  upon you  Every child in love matters would find you out  But be it your glory  whether our wishes are  or are not answered  that your affection is laudable  that the object of it is not a man mean in understanding  profligate in morals  nor sordid in degree  but such an one as all we your friends are as much in love with as you can be  Only  my dear Love  my Harriet  the support of my life  and comfort of my evil days  endeavour  for my sake  and for the sake of us all  to restrain so far your laudable inclination  as that  if it be not your happy lot to give us  as well as yourself  so desirable a blessing  you may not suffer in your health  an health so precious to me  and put yourself on a soot with vulgar girls run away with by their headstrong passions  The more desirable the object  the nobler the conquest of your passion  if it is to be overcome  Nevertheless  speak out  my dear  your whole heart to us  in order to intitle yourself to our best advice  And as to your uncle Selby  don t let his raillery pain you  He diverts us as well as himself by it  He gains nothing over us in the arguments he affects to hold with us  And you must know  that his whole honest heart is wrapt up in his and our Harriet  Worthy man  He would not  any more than I  be able to support his spirits  were any misfortune to befal his niece   Your aunt Selby has just now shewn me her letter to you  She repeats in it  as a very strong expression in yours     That you had rather converse wish this excellent man but one hour in a week  than be the wife of any man you have ever seen or known    It is a strong expression  but  to me  is an expression greatly to your honour  since it shews  that the mind   120 and not the person  is the principal object of your love     I knew that  if ever you did love  it would be a love of the purest kind  As therefore it has not so much person in it  as most loves  suffer it not to triumph over your reason  nor  because you cannot have the man you could prefer  resolve against having any other  Have I not taught you  that marriage is a duty  whenever it can be enter d into with prudence  What a mean  what a selfish mind must that person have  whether man or woman  who can resolve against entering into the state  because it has its cares  its fatigues  its inconveniencies  Try Sir Charles Grandison  my dear  by this rule  If he forbears to marry on such narrow motives  this must be one of his great imperfections  Nor be afraid to try  No man is absolutely perfect   But Sir Charles may have engagements  from which he cannot free himself  My Harriet  I hope  will not give way to a passion  which is not likely to be returned  if she find that to be the case  You hope  you prettily said in one of your letters     that you shall not be undone by a good man    After such an escape as you had from Sir Hargrave  I have no fear from a bad one  But  my child  if you are undone by a good one  it must be by your own fault  while neither he nor his sisters give you encouragement     I know  my dear  how these suppositions will hurt your delicacy  But then you must doubly guard yourself  for the reality will be worse wounding to that delicacy  than the supposition ought to be  If there be but one man in the world that can undo you  will you not guard against him   I long to fold my dearest Harriet to my fond heart  But yet  this that follows  is the advice I give  as to the situation you are now in  Lose no opportunity of cultivating the friendship of his amiable sisters  By the way  if Miss Grandison guesses at your mind  she is   121 not so generous in her raillery as is consistent with the rest of her amiable character   Never deny them your company  when they request it  Miss Grandison has promised you the history of their family  Exact the performance of that promise from her  You will thus come at further lights  by which you may be guided in your future steps —In particular  you will find out  whether the sisters espouse the interest of any other woman  tho  Sir Charles s
