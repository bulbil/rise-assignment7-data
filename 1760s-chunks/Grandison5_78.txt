it should be thought a lover like artifice  to move compassion  I will not owe my success  even with a Clementina  to mean contrivances  You know I have pride  my dear friend—Pride which your example has not been able to subdue  tho  it has sometimes made me ashamed of it   One o Clock   CAMILLA  by direction of her two Ladies  made me a visit about two hours ago  They were alarmed at my postponing my attendance on Lady Clementina till the afternoon  suspecting that the Count of Belvedere had unwelcomely engaged me  and therefore sent the worthy woman to know the true cause  Camilla observing that I looked ill  I desired her to take no notice of it to any body  But she could not help acquainting the Marchioness with it  who  ordering her to forbear mentioning it to Clementina and Jeronymo  was so good  attended by Father Marescotti  to make me a visit in person   Never was mother more tender to her own son  than she was to me  The Father expressed a paternal affection for me  I made light of the illness  being resolved  if possible  to attend them in the afternoon  My mind  my dear friend  is disturbed  I want to be at a certainty  Yet  from what the Marchioness hinted  I believe I have no reason to doubt  The Page  195 Father and the Bishop have spared no pains  I dare say  to strengthen the Lady s scruples  Their whole study  the Marchioness intimated  is now  in what menner to acknowlege their obligations to me   They owe me none   My dear Chevalier  said she  at parting  take care of your health  She put her hand on mine—Your precious health  Don t think of coming out  We will in turn attend you here   NOTWITHSTANDING the advice of the Marchioness  I went to the palace of Porretta  as soon as I thought their dinner time was over  Signor Jeronymo desired to be alone with me for a few minutes  and when he was  began upon the subject of the unexpected turn which his sister had taken  I found  that he had been acquainted with the truth of every thing  Not a single circumstance was omitted  that might enable him to judge fairly of the whole   And will you  Grandison  can you  my dear friend  said he  have the goodness to attend with patience the event of this dear girl s heroism  or what shall I call it   I assured him  that the restoration of his sister s health of mind was the dearest to me of all considerations  and that I came over at first with no other hopes than his recovery and hers  resolved to leave to Providence all the rest   The Marchioness came in soon after  and taking me aside  chid me with tenderness even maternal  for coming abroad  The Marquis  the Count  the Bishop  and Father Marescotti  joined us  and then they all  as with one voice  offered to use their interests with Clementina in my favour  if either my peace of mind  or my health  were likely to be affected by her present resolution   While there was conscience in it  I answered  I would not  for the world  that she should be urged to change Page  196 it  Nothing now  as I believed  remained to be done  but to try the firmness of her resolution  by first short  and then longer absences  And those I would propose to herself  if they thought fit  when I was next admitted to her presence   Jeronymo  and all the family  I saw were of one mind  Tell me  say  my dear Dr  Bartlett  is it excusable in a man  who has been so long favoured by your conversation  and should have been benefited by your example  who have behaved so greatly in disappointments  and even persecutions  to find in himself a pride that  at the instant  had almost carried him into petulance  when he saw every one of this family appear to be more pleased than displeased  that he was not likely to be allied to them —Who yet  when he coolly considers  and puts himself in the case of each individual of it  must acknowlege  that they might well be allowed to rejoice  the great article of religion out of the question  in the hope of keeping her among them in her native country  and the more  because of the unhappy disorder of her mind  and out of a distant one  obnoxious to them all  as England is  Would not my own father and mother  would not I myself  have equally rejoiced in such a turn in the affections of a sister of my own  especially if we had complied with her principally from motives of compassion  and contrary to the interests of our family   The Marchioness conducted me to the young Lady  She received me with a blush  as a person would do another whom she was sensible she had causelesly disappointed  She took notice  after the first emotion  that I seemed not to be well  and cast an eye of compassion
