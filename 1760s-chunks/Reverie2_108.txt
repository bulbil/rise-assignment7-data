Though fuch a domeftic fcene as this was a   defcent from thofe great ones which I had   lately been engaged in obferving  yet  as it   difplayed the inconfiftency of the human heart     in a new light  I thought it merited my atten    tion    The occafion of the breach was this   One     of the lord s agents  who  by the a 5liv ity and   fanguinefs of his temper  had in a manner en     rofied the whole management of his mafter s   affairs  had itaken it in his head to go to law   with one of the principal gentlemen in the   neighbourhood  from an apprehenfion that he   intended to take the  part of ii coufm of his    with v hom his  lordfhip had had a long fuit   for encroaching upon his fide of the common    The agent had conduced this fuit with equal   judgment and fuccefs  and at a very great ex    pence  for it was not his difpofition to fl arve   any caufe he took in hand  foiled his adverfa    ry in all his attempts  and not only recovered   from him the places he had unjuflly pofleffed   himfelf of  but alfo obtained feveral decrees for   cofts  by which he turned him out of fo many   other parts of his eftate  that he had not left   him a penny to fee an attorney to carry on the   fuit anv longer  though his proud and litigious   temper would not permit him to give it up    Matters   THE REVERIE  23      Matters were in this fituation  when the   agent propored filing a bill directly againd    the coufin  who  he faid he had received un    doubted intelligence  had entered into a pri    vate agreement with the other to fupply him   with nionev to  q o on wit i liis law fuit  and    amft him alTo with his intercfl  to recover   his lofTcs  This was a direct breach of a   former agreement between him and his lord    ililp  by which he had obliged himfelf not to   mCddle in the difpute at all j the agent was for   falling upon him without any ceremony  al    kdging  that it was much better to be plaintiff   than defendant in any fuit   as nmft certainly   be their cafe if they were not before hand v  ith   the other  who was at that very time preparing   to attack them  as appeared by feveral late imr   fiances of his behaviour    To this propofal his lordfhip did not think   proper to give a determinate anfwcr  till he   fhould confult with the reft of his tenants and   fervants   as  by their leafes  they were all bound   to defray the expences of any fuits which were   far the general good of the ellate  But when   the agent acquainted them with his defign     though he fupported it with very ftrong rea    fons  and which in the fequel proved to be well    founded  they were all of a different opinion    and faid  it would be very imprudent to en    tangle themfelves in a new difpute before they     were out of tlie old  efpecially as they were al    ready at a greater expence than they could well   bear    The agent  whofe temper was too warm to   brook  oppofition  without any refpect to his   inalkr s prefence  flew into a violent pailion    audi   234 THE R E V E R I E    and called them a parcel of poor fpirited trim    ming fellows  who v ould lofe a pound to favc   a penny  They were not behind hand with   him in abufe  but faid  that he was a hot    headed beggarly upftart  who  having no for    tune of his own to lofe  cared not what ex    pence or danger he drew others into    The lord thought it but juft  in fuch a cafe    as this  to follow the opinion of the majority    and therefore reje6ted the agent s propoial    But he did not give k up on that account   but   refolved to try another method  bv which he   did not doubt of carrying his point  The   great fuccefs with which he had managed his   mafler s bufinefs  ever fmce he had been em    ployed  had made him fuch a favourite with    the tenants  and given him befide fo great a   confequence in his own eyes  that he thought   his lordfliip could not do without him
