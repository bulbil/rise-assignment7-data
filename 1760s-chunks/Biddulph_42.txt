dean is as frolick as May day upon it  for he is very fond of Mr Arnold  but tells him he will not forgive him for robbing him of his second wife  for such  he says  he intended me  I think his daughter  a pretty girl of about seventeen  looks a little grave of late  I hope she does not like Mr Arnold herself  I wish my mother would take it into her head that she was in love with him  and that Mr Arnold had promised to marry her  then should I a second time crown me with a willow garland  But there is no fear of this  or rather no hope   Lady Grimston has given my mother such a character of Mr Arnold  that if you will take her word for it  there is not a man like him in the world  and my mother firmly believes every syllable she says  She told me to day she would write to Sir George  to give him an account of the matter  and desire his advice  This is a compliment she would not omit paying  for any consideration  tho’ I know my brother’s judgment has now lost all credit with her  and that  let his opinion be what it will  she is firmly resolved on her new plan  Knowing as you do my mother’s firmness  when once she is possessed with a thing  you will not wonder that I did not make attempts to alter her mind  which I knew would be fruitless  She likes Mr Arnold prodigiously  she piques herself on her skill in physiognomy  and says  if she is deceived in this gentleman  she will never again rely on that science  Lady Grimston is so fond of him  that I wonder she did not marry him herself   September 23  We have received two letters from Sir George  one in answer to my mother’s letter  the other to me  I will give them both to you  the following is a copy of that to my mother   Madam   I thank you for the honour you do me in asking my advice  in regard to the proposal of marriage you have received for my sister  but I am entirely disqualified from giving you any  as I am an absolute stranger both to the person and character of the gentleman you mention  and know no more of him  than that I have heard there is such a person  who has some estate in the county where you now you are   As you are absolute mistress of your daughter’s will  as well as    of her person  I shall not presume to interfere in this nice point  If the marriage is not already agreed upon  which may be the case  notwithstanding the compliment you do me the favour to pay me   I think it would be generous in you to see Miss B  and hear what she has to say  before you proceed farther  but in this  as in every thing else  your own discretion must guide you   I am  Madam  Your affectionate son  and most obedient servant  George Bidulph   London  Sept  22   My mother was exceedingly displeased with this letter  She said Sir George had a haughtiness in him that was very offensive to her  I have acquitted myself in applying to him  and shall give myself no farther trouble about him or his opinion  As for Miss B  I think she can hardly be under a necessity of coming to town as yet  and that affair may keep cold  for I have but little curiosity to hear what the poor Soul may be prompted to say  as I am sure I shall be time enough to afford her any assistance she may stand in need of  This was the whole of her observation  My brother’s letter to me is as follows   Dear Sidney   I received with concern  though I own not with surprize  an account from my mother  of a new treaty of marriage that is on foot between you and a Mr Arnold  of whom I know nothing  Instead of congratulating you upon this occasion  I cannot help condoling with you  for I have a better opinion of your heart than to suppose it can have so soon renounced poor Faulkland  I do not reproach you for your acquiescence in giving him up  I know you could not do otherwise  but why in the name of precipitancy are you to be hurried into wedlock already  You went into the country to recover your health  I thought  prithee  how comes this new husband into your way  I know  child  it is not of your seeking  and do from my heart pity you   I would by no means have you guilty of a breach of duty to our mother  but for Heaven’s sake  why don’t you try your influence over her  to have this sudden scheme of matrimony suspended  till she sees and talks to this girl that Faulkland refers her to  If the wench owns that he was not to blame so much as she herself was  and relinquishes all pretensions to him  don’t you think she  my mother I mean  would in that case remain bound in honour to yield you to his prior claim   Indeed
