so barbarous   a manner  as I understand she exclaims I have  and as she will not   eat any thing  unless I give her my company   So he saluted me  and   withdrew  and I locked the door after him again for fear       Mrs  Jewkes soon after rapped at the door  Who s there  said I  Only   I  madam  So I opened the door   Tis a sad thing  madam  said she    you should be so much afraid in your own house  She brought me some   chocolate and toast  and I asked her about my lady s behaviour  She   said  she would not suffer any body to attend but her woman  because she   would not be heard what she had to say  but she believed  she said  her   master was very angry with the young lord  as she called her kinsman    for  as she passed by the door  she heard him say  in a high tone  I   hope  sir  you did not forget what belongs to the character you assume    or to that effect       About one o clock my master came up again  and he said  Will you come   down to dinner  Pamela  when I send for you  Whatever you command  sir    I must do  But my lady won t desire to see me  No matter whether she   will or no  But I will not suffer  that she shall prescribe her insolent   will to my wife  and in your own house too   I will  by my tenderness to   you  mortify her pride  and it cannot be done so well as to her face       Dearest sir  said I  pray indulge me  and let me dine here by myself  It   will make my lady but more inveterate   Said he  I have told her we are   married  She is out of all patience about it  and yet pretends not to   believe it  Upon that I tell her  Then she shall have it her own way    and that I am not  And what has she to do with it either way  She has   scolded and begged  commanded and prayed  blessed me  and cursed me    by turns  twenty times in these few hours  And I have sometimes soothed   her  sometimes raged  and at last left her  and took a turn in the   garden for an hour to compose myself  because you should not see how the   foolish woman has ruffled me  and just now I came out  seeing her coming   in       Just as he had said so  I cried  Oh  my lady  my lady  for I heard   her voice in the chamber  saying  Brother  brother  one word with   you  stopping in sight of the closet where I was  He stepped out  and   she went up to the window that looks towards the garden  and said  Mean   fool that I am  to follow you up and down the house in this manner    though I am shunned and avoided by you  You a brother   You a barbarian    Is it possible we could be born of one mother       Why  said he  do you charge me with a conduct to you  that you bring   upon yourself   Is it not surprising that you should take the liberty   with me  that the dear mother you have named never gave you an example   for to any of her relations   Was it not sufficient  that I was   insolently taken to task by you in your letters  but my retirements must   be invaded  My house insulted  And  if I have one person dearer to me   than another  that that person must be singled out for an object of your   violence       Ay  said she  that one person is the thing   But though I came with a   resolution to be temperate  and to expostulate with you on your avoiding   me so unkindly  yet cannot I have patience to look upon that bed in   which I was born  and to be made the guilty scene of your wickedness   with such a          Hush  said he  I charge you  call not the dear girl by any name unworthy   of her  You know not  as I told you  her excellence  and I desire you ll   not repeat the freedoms you have taken below       She stamped with her foot  and said  God give me patience  So much   contempt to a sister that loves you so well  and so much tenderness to a   vile
