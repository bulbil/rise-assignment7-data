reservedness  even to them  may not let them know the secrets of his heart in this particular  And if they do not espouse any other person s interest  why may they not be made your friends  my dear —As to fortune  could we have any hint what would be expected  we would do every thing in our power to make that matter easy  and must be content with moderate settlements in your favour   But as I approve of your aunt s having forborn to write  as you would have had her  to Lady D  What shall we do in that affair  It will be ask d   What  Why thus  Lady D  has made it a point  that you are disengaged in your affections  Your aunt has signified to her that your are  You have given that Lady an hint  which  you say  overclouded her brow  She will be here on Saturday next  Then will she  no doubt  expect the openest dealing —And she ought to have it  Her own frankness demands it  and the character we have hitherto supported  and I hope always shall support  requires it  I would therefore let Lady D  know the whole of Sir Hargrave Pollexfen s attempt  You  my dear  was so laudably frank as to hint it to her  and of the generous protection given you by Sir Charles Grandison  Truth never leaves room for self reproach  Let your aunt Selby then own  that you had written to her  declining  with the most respectful gratitude  the honour intended you  Which she could no otherwise account for  than by supposing  and indeed believing  that you would prefer Sir Charles   122 Grandison  from motives of gratitude  to any other man  But that you knew nothing of his engagements  nor had reason to look upon any part of his behaviour to you  but as the effect of his general politeness  nor that his sisters meant more by calling you sister  than their brother s sister  as well as theirs   All this shall be mentioned to Lady D  in strict confidence  Then will Lady D  know the whole truth  She will be enabled  as she ought  to judge for herself  You will not appear in her eye as guilty of affectation  We shall all act in character  If Lady L  and Miss Grandison did  as you suppose  acquaint Lady D  that you were not addressed by their brother  they will be found to have said the truth  and you know  my dear  that we should be as ready to do justice to others veracity  as to our own  She will see  that your regard for Sir Charles  if a regard you have  that may be an obstacle to her views  is owing to a laudable gratitude for his protection given to a young woman  whose heart was before absolutely disengaged   And what will be the consequence —Why  either that her Ladyship will think no more of the matter  and then you will be just where you were  or  that she will interest herself in finding out Sir Charles s engagements  And as you have communicated to Lady L  and Miss Grandison the letters that have passed between Lady D  and your aunt  together with the contents of yours  so far as relates to the proposal  and as Lady D  is acquainted with those two ladies  she will probably inform herself of their sentiments in relation to the one affair and the other  and the matter on every side  by this means  will sooner come to a decision  than probably it can any other way   I don t know whether I express myself clearly  I am not what I was  But  blessed be God  that I am what I am  I did not think  that  in so little a time  I could have written so much as I have  But my dear Harriet is my subject  and her happiness is  and has   123 ever been  my only care  since I lost the husband of my youth  the dear man who divided with me that  and all my cares  who had a love for you equal to my own  and who  I think  would have given just such advice  What would Mr  Shirley have thought  How would he  in the like case  have acted  are the questions I always ask myself  before I give my opinion in any material cases  especially in those which relate to you   And here let me commend a sentiment of yours  that is worthy of your dear grandfather s pupil     I should despise myself   say you   were I capable of keeping one man in suspense  while I was balancing in favour of another      Good young creature  hold fast your principles  whatever befalls you  Look upon this world as you have been taught to look upon it  I have lived to a great age  Yet to look backward to the time of my youth  when I was not a stranger to the hopes and fears that now agitate you  what a short space does it seem to be  Nothing
