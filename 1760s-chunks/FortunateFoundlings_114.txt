and pale as he was grown thro  his long confinement  and the many   hardships he had sustained  this prince found something in him that   attracted his admiration   Methinks  said he  since glory was your aim    you might as well have hoped to acquire it under the banners of our   invincible emperor       Alas  my lord  replied Horatio with a sigh  that title  till very   lately  was given to the king of Sweden  and  I believe  whatever fate   has attended that truly great prince  those who had the honour to be   distinguished by him  will never be suspected either of cowardice or   baseness   It was by brave and open means our king taught his soldiers   the way to victory  not by mean subterfuges and little plots   I cannot   therefore conceive for what reason I am brought hither to be examined on   any score that has the appearance of a conspiracy       Yes  replied the prince feircely  you and your fellow prisoners have   endeavoured to insinuate yourselves into the favour of persons whom you   imagined entrusted with the secrets of the government   being prisoners   of war  you formed contrivances for your escape  and attempted to   inveigle others to accompany your flight       That every tittle of this accusation is false  my lord  cried Horatio    there needs no more than the improbability of it to prove   Indeed the   cruel usage we sustained  might have justified an attempt to free   ourselves  yet did such a design never enter our heads   we were so far   from making use of any stratagems for that purpose  that we never made   the least overture to any of the guards  who were the only persons we   were allowed to converse with       How  said the prince interrupting him  were not your privileges enlarged   by the interposition of a lady   Did she not make you considerable   allowances out of her own purse  and frequently visit you to receive   your thanks   And were you not emboldened by these favours to urge her   to reveal what secrets were in her knowledge  and even to assist you in   your escape   You doubtless imagined you could prevail on her also to go   with you   part of this  continued he  she has herself confessed   it   will therefore be in vain for you to deny it   if you ingenuously reveal   these particulars she has omitted  you may hope to find favour  but it   you obstinately persist  as your companions have done  in attempting to   impose upon me  you must expect to share the same fate immediately       In speaking these words he made a sign to the soldier  who throwing open   a large folding door  discovered a rack on which one of the Swedish   officers was tied  and the others stood near bound  and in the hands of   the executioner       This sight so amazed Horatio  that he had not the power of speaking one   word   till Mullern  who happened to be the person that was fastened   upon the rack  cried out to him   Be not lost in consideration  Horatio    said he  are we not in the hands of Muscovites  from whom nothing that   is human can be expected   rather prepare yourself to disappoint their   cruelty  by bravely suffering all they dare inflict       Hold then  said Horatio  even Muscovites would chuse to have some   pretence for what they do  and sure the first favourite and   generalissimo of a prince  who boasts an inclination to civilize his   barbarous subjects  will not  without any cause  torture them whom   chance alone has put into his power  and who have never done him any   personal injury   By heaven  pursued he  turning to the prince  we all   are innocent of any part of those crimes laid to our charge   time    perhaps  if our declarations are ineffectual  will convince your   highness we are so  and you will then regret the injustice you have   done us       You all are in one story  cried the prince  but I am well assured of the   main point   the particulars is all I want to be informed of   but since   I am compelled to speak more plain  which of you is it for whose sake   you all received such instances of Edella s bounty   Whoever tells me   that  even tho  it be the person himself  shall have both pardon   and liberty       Impossible it is to express the astonishment every one was in at this   demand  five of them
