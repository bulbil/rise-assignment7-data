frequently have you swelled up with an air of the most conscious importance  when some shopkeeper has observed  with an audible voice  that there was no doubt  for all the rustiness of your coat  but what you were somebody  or you would never be so familiar with so well drest a gentleman—Ah Melmoth  Melmoth  you philosophers are actuated as much by vanity as the most mincing fopling in the universe—Your very contempt of appearance is the absolute result of your pride  tho  you would willingly put it down as the consequence of your sense or the effect of your humility  and I am perfectly satisfied that Diogenes in his tub was fifty times a greater coxcomb than Alexander  though the puppy ridiculously affected to look down on the conqueror of the world  and mistook for an exalted emanation of soul what was nothing but   6 a despicable sally of impertinence —All this  Charles  you will possibly say is very true  but at the same time I am rather apprehensive you will tell me it is very dull also —I shall therefore consult your amusement in preference to your instruction  and for once suffer sober sentiment to make room for flimsey narrative   Well then  about seven o clock I dressed myself in a very elegant suit of blue velvet embroidered with silver  and went in a chair to my sister Haversham s  where I found a large company of both sexes  and  in justice to the intimation contained in her card  I must acknowledge that I never saw a group of handsomer women in my life—One in particular engaged my utmost attention  whom I soon found to be LOUISA MILDMAY  of Oxfordshire —the celebrated toast  who  though no more than   7 twenty one  has made the whole county a thousand times drunk  and occasioned four duels  in which two hot headed blockheads were actually killed  and a third so disabled  by a wound in his hip  as to be doomed for life to crutches and repentance   As I had often heard of this young lady s beauty  and was moreover told that she affected an insensibility to the most engaging efforts of gallantry  I resolved to exert my utmost abilities in hopes of making some little impression on her bosom  as I considered that it would greatly add to my character among the women if I could possibly succeed with one  who was looked upon by both sexes with an equal mixture of envy and admiration —Actuated by this motive  my business was to work upon her pride without exciting her resentment  and to shew   8 that  irresistible as she had hitherto proved  there was one man who could nevertheless behold her with indifference —I therefore behaved to her with all the politeness of the most distant civility  while I sung  chatted  and romped with little Harriot Townly  and paid  in short  a much greater degree of attention to every other woman in the room —The women  all highly delighted with the preference which was thus given them by a well drest young fellow  with a title and a large estate  in a manner devoured me  Harriot Townly in particular hung about me the whole evening  and  had it not been for the regard which I entertain for her brother  I do not know how far I might be tempted to carry my civilities   As I was by much the best drest  and  without any compliment to myself  by much the likeliest  fellow in the   9 room  Louisa could not see this palpable neglect of her beauty without the most sensible mortification  accustomed to be worshiped as a kind of divinity whereever she appeared  it was a most distressing circumstance to find her inferiors in beauty treated with a preferable degree of respect  and  probably  supposing that I should have fallen an instant conquest  like a number of others  the disappointment doubled her chagrin  and I could easily perceive that she cast several glances of a mingled anger and contempt at your poor friend  as if she equally saw through my purpose and despised it —Be this however as it may  I retired early to give the ladies an opportutunity of talking about me  and the next morning went to breakfast at lady Haversham s  on purpose to hear from my sister  what was said after my departure the preceding evening     10Being shewn up  who should I see  to my very great surprize  at the teatable  but Miss Louisa—she was alone with my sister  and seemed somewhat confused at my appearance  all this  you know  had a very good sign  and gave me an additional cause to pursue a plan of operation which already wore so probable a face of success —I therefore bowed with the coldest air of respect  and  with an inattention not altogether the most mannerly  entered into some trifling discourse with my sister  scarcely ever opening my lips to Louisa  though she kindly encouraged me  by some occasional smiles at what I said  to make her a party in the conversation —Guessing pretty clearly that  if I took my leave  I should have something worth listening to in the afternoon  I wished the women a good morning  and went away with telling lady Haversham    11 that I should possibly call in on her before I went home to dress
