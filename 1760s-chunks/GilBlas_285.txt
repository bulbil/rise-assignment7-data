shall only just go to Madrid now and then  to snuff the gale of the ministerial atmosphere  and try whether any scent lies which may be favourable for your pursuit  Thus will you combine in me a bosom friend  a trusty messenger  and an unsuspected spy   These advantages were too important for me to forego them  I therefore kept so useful a person about me  with leave of the obliging warden  who would not stand in the way of so soothing a relief to the weariness of solitude       CH  VIII     Scipio s first journey to Madrid  its object and success  Gil Blas falls sick  The consequence of his illness   IF it is a common proverb that our direst enemies are those of our own household  the converse ought equally to be admitted among the saws of a more candid experience  After such incontestable proofs of Scipio s zeal  he became to me like another self  All distinction of place was confounded between Gil Blas and his secretary  all insolence was dropped on the one hand  all cringing on the other  Their lodging  bed  and board were in common   Scipio s conversation was of a very lively turn  he might have been dubbed the Spanish Momus  without any derogation to the Punch of the Pantheon  But he had a long head  as well as a fanciful brain  combining the characters of counsellor and jester  My friend  said I  one day  what do you think of writing to the Duke of Lerma  It could  methinks  do no harm  Why  as to that  answered he  the great are such chameleons  that there is no knowing where to have them  At all events you may risk it  though I would not lay the postage of your letter on its success  The minister loves you  it is true  but then political love lacks memory  as much as personal love lacks visual discrimination  Out of sight  out of mind  is at once the motto and the stigma of these gentry   True as this may be in the general  replied I  my patron is a glorious exception  His kindness lives in my recollection  I am persuaded that he suffers for my sufferings  and that they are incessantly preying on his spirits  We must give him credit for only waiting till the king s anger shall pass away  Be it so  resumed he  I wish you may not reckon without your host  Assail his excellency then with an epistle to stir the waters  I will engage to deliver it into his own hands  Pen  ink  and paper being brought  I composed a specimen of eloquence which Scipio declared to be a paragon of pathos  and Tordesillas preferred  for the cant of sermonizing prolixity  to the old archbishop s homilies   I flattered myself that there would be tears in the Duke of Lerma s eyes  and distraction in his aspect  at the detail of miseries which existed only on paper  In that assurance  I despatched my messenger  who no sooner got to Madrid  than he went to the minister s  Meeting with an old domestic of my acquaintance  he had no difficulty in gaining access to the duke  My lord  said Scipio to his excellency  as he delivered the packet  one of your most devoted servants  lying at his length on straw  in a damp and dreary dungeon at Segovia  most humbly supplicates for the perusal of this letter  which a tender  hearted turnkey has furnished him with the means of writing  The minister opened the letter  and glanced over the contents  But though he found there a motive and a cue for passion  enough to amaze all his faculties at once  far from drowning the floor with briny secretions  he cleaved the ear of his household  and smote the heart of my courier with horrid speech  Friend  tell Santillane that he has a great deal of impudence to address me  after so rank an offence  worthily confronted by the severe sentence of the king  Under that sentence let the wretch drag out his days  nor look to my mediation for a respite   Scipio  though neither dull nor muddy mettled  began to be unpregnant of this defeated cause  Yet he was not so pigeon  livered as to retire without an effort in my favour  My lord  replied he  this poor prisoner will give up the ghost with grief  at the recital of your excellency s displeasure  The duke answered like a prime minister  with a supercilious corrugation of features  and a decisive revolution of his front to some more prosperous suitor  This he did  to cover his own share in the shame of pimping  and such treatment must all those hireling scavengers expect  who rake in the filth and ordure of rotten statesmen  courtiers  and politicians   My secretary came back to Segovia and delivered the result of his mission  And now behold me  sunk deeper than on the first day of my imprisonment  in the gulf of affliction and despair  The Duke of Lerma s turning king s evidence gave a hanging posture to my affairs  My courage was run out  and though they did all they
