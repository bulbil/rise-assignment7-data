that seemed so inconsistent with his character    But his motives for it did honour to the man  however strange they   may appear in the politician  He had admitted him to a degree   of personal intimacy  He had approved of his engaging in a cause   to which he was himself attached most sanguinely  and he scorned   to desert him in distress  occasioned by what he thought an error   of his judgment  not a fault of his intention  Beside the con    solation to himself  the honour of such a visit was of the greatest   advantage to my master s affairs  as it lightened the personal       The Romans          480 ADVENTURES OP A GUINEA     prejudices against him  and gave a good opinion of a cause which   appeared to have the countenance of such a man  Intoxicated   with the popularity he had thus acquired  v hich  if rightly managed    might have done great matters  he was no sooner at liberty than he   threw off all restraint  and ran into such licentiousness  as in a short   time lessened its force  and lost him every trace of the good opinion   of all who gave themselves time to think of the causes and con    sequences of such conduct  But his triumph was not long lived    He had been restored to his liberty  not as a right common to all   the members of the community on a supposition of the Ulegality   of the manner in which he had been deprived of it  but in consequence   of certain immunities   annexed to a particular part of the legislature    to which he belonged  Though the abilities and integrity of the   magistrate   who made this distinction were imquestionable  some   persons  who looked further than the present moment  imagined   they could trace it to a cause not commonly attended to  He had   on former occasions  been irwtrumental in depriving some people of   liberty in the same manner   to have condemned that manner there    fore  now as illegal  would have been condemning himself   at the same   time that upright obedience to the dictates of his present opinion   obliged him to set him free  Such a difficulty must have been dis    tressing  but this distinction delivered him from it  and enabled   him to save his credit and conscience both  as those people had   borne no part in the legislature  and therefore had not been entitled   to such immunity      I see your indignation arise at the thought that in a country which   boasts of being governed by equal laws  any one set of men should   enjoy immunities denied to the rest   but that indignation proceeds   from viewing the matter in a partial light  In the country where   your lot has happily fallen  the end of government is better secxired   by a division of its powers  than in any other under heaven  The   great T  isdom of those who made this division appears in the pro    visions made to preserve each part in it independent of the rest    the only means by which the division itself could be preserved    Now  as the executive power necessarily belongs solely to the prince    it was equally necessary to secure those who bore a part with him   in the legislative from any undue exertion of that power  which   might be attempted in order to break through that independence    and join the legislative to the executive   or  in other words  vest   both powers absolutely  and without limitation  in the prince    And this was the reason of immunities so much talked of  and   so little understood      If it be said that these immunities operate also against fellow    subjects  from whom there can be no fear  and are sometimes  per    haps too often   abused to dishonest ends  the answer must be sought     i Privilege of Pailiament  Wilkes was member for Aylesbury        Lord Chief Justice Pratt      3 Alludes to the case of Dr John Shebbeare  who was seized on a   general warrant in 1758 for his letters attacking the government    Pratt  then Attorney General  laid the information against Shebbeare    who was sentenced to stand in the pillory          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA  481     for in the depravity of the human heart  which will pervert the best   institutions to the worst purposes  and makes it necessaiy to preclude   every exception  that it should not be extended to serve them    As for instance  if the meanest subject of the state had a right to   claim the assistance of the civil power in every case against
