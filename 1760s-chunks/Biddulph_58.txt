woman charming who had nothing else to boast of  Whether her understanding be of a piece with the rest  I have not yet been able to discover  Her visit to me was but short  for she had not sat with me an hour when lady V—— came in  and she then took her leave  but by what I could observe in that little time  she seems to have as much vivacity and agreeable humour  as I ever met with in any one  She pressed me to dine with her at her cottage  as she calls it  to morrow  and I like her too well to refuse the invitation   These two charming women  I think  I shall single out for my chief intimates  from the crowd which have been to compliment me  on my coming into this country   Mr Arnold is mightily pleased with them both  but he gives the preference to lady V——  whom  tho’ he had a slight acquaintance with her lord  he never saw before  But he is almost as great a stranger in this place as I am  he is highly delighted at my having met with people who are likely to render it agreeable to me   July 21  We dined to day according to appointment with Mrs Gerrarde  A cottage she called her house  nor does it appear much better at the outside  but within it is a fairy palace  Never was any thing so neat  so elegant  so perfectly well fansied  as the fitting up of all her rooms  Her bedchambers are furnished with fine chints  and her drawing room with the prettiest Indian sattin I ever saw  Her little villa is called Ashby  and her husband  she told me  purchased it for her some time before his death  and left it to her  but she has since had a considerable addition to her fortune  by the death of a relation   Our entertainment was splendid almost to profusion  though there was no company but Mr Arnold and I  I told her  if she always gave such dinners  it would frighten me away from her  indeed it was the only circumstance in her whole conduct that did not please me  for I was charmed with the rest of her behaviour  They must surely be of a very churlish disposition  who are not pleased  where a manifest desire to oblige is conspicuous in every word and action  If Mrs     Gerrarde is not as highly polished as some women are  who  perhaps  have had a more enlarged education  she makes full amends for it by a perfect good humour  a sprightliness always entertaining  and a quickness of thought  that gives her conversation an air of something very like wit  and which I dare say passes for the thing itself with most people   July 24  I have returned lady V——’s visit  and am more delighted with her than before  Mr Arnold went with me  but my lord not being at home  he went to ramble about the grounds  so that I had a long tête à tête with lady V——  She is an admirable woman  so fine an understanding  such delicacy of sentiment  and such an unaffected complaisance in her manner  that I do not wonder my lord perfectly adores her  There is a tenderness  a maternal kindness in her behaviour towards me  that fills me at once with love and reverence for her  and  next to my Cecilia  I think I never met with any woman whom I could so highly esteem as lady V——  She is an admirable mistress of her needle  and every room in her house exhibits some production of a very fine genius  united with very great industry  for there are beds  chairs  and carpets  besides some very pretty rural prospects in panels  executed with inimitable skill  and very excellent taste  She tells me  if I will give her leave to bring her work with her  she will live whole days with me   I am rejoiced now that Mr Arnold thought of coming to South Park  How valuable is the acquaintance of such a woman as lady V——  and I might never have known her  but for a circumstance to which I was at first so averse  And then my agreeable lively Mrs Gerrarde  My acquaintance at Arnold abbey begin to fade upon my memory  to say the truth  I think of none of them with pleasure  but Mrs Vere  and my good humoured old Dean   August 4  Mrs Gerrarde is a little saucy monopolist  she grumbles if I do not see her every day  and is downright jealous of my intimacy with lady V——  They are acquainted  but I don’t find there is a very close intercourse between them  Mrs Gerrarde says  her ladyship is too good a houswife for her  and as she is not very fond of needle work herself  she cannot endure people that are always poring over a frame  I find indeed  that this sprightly rogue is fonder of cards than    of work  she draws Mr Arnold and me in very often for a pool at piquet  at her house I am obliged to submit  but at my own  I often take up a book  when she
