 always been steeled  but the Countess joined the most piercing wit  the most winning politeness  the most engaging sensibility  the most exquisite delicacy  to a form perfectly lovely  You will not therefore wonder that the warmth and inexperience of youth  hourly exposed in so dangerous a situation  was unable to resist such variety of attractions  Charmed with the flattering preference she seemed to give me  my vanity fed by the notice of so accomplished a creature  forgetting those sentiments of honour which ought never to be one moment suspended  I became passionately in love with this charming woman  for some months  I struggled with my love  till  on her observing that my health seemed impaired and I had lost my usual vivacity  I took courage to confess the cause  though in terms which sufficiently spoke my despair of touching a heart which I feared was too sensible to virtue        1 24       for my happiness  I implored her pity  and protested I had no hope of inspiring a tenderer sentiment  Whilst I was speaking  which was in broken interrupted sentences  the Countess looked at me with the strongest sorrow and compassion painted in her eyes  she was for some moments silent  and seemed lost in thought  but at last  with an air of dignified sweetness   My dear Enrico   said she   shall I own to you that I have for some time feared this confession  I ought perhaps to resent this declaration  which from another I could never have forgiven  but  as I know and esteem the goodness of your heart  as I respect your father infinitely  and love you with the innocent tenderness of a sister  I will only entreat you to reflect how injurious this passion is to the Count  who has the tenderest esteem for you  and would sacrifise almost his life for your happiness  be assured of my        1 25       eternal friendship  unless you forfeit it by persisting in a pursuit equally destructive to your own probity and my honor  receive the tenderest assurances of it   continued she  giving me her hand to kiss  but believe  at the same time  that the Count deserves and possesses all my love  I had almost said  my adoration  The fondest affection united us  and time  instead of lessening  every hour encreases our mutual passion  Reserve your heart  my good Enrico  for some amiable lady of your own nation  and believe that love has no true pleasures but when it keeps within the bounds of honour       It is impossible  my dear Mordaunt  to express to you the shame this discourse filled me with  her gentle  her affectionate reproofs  the generous concern she shewed for my error  the mild dignity of her aspect  plunged me into inexpressible confusion  and shewed my fault in its          1 26       blackest colours  at the same time that her behaviour  by increasing my esteem  added to the excess of my passion  I attempted to answer her  but it was impossible  awed  abashed  humbled before her  I had not courage even to meet her eyes  like the fallen angel in Milton  I felt     How awful goodness is  and saw    Virtue in her own shape how lovely       The Countess saw  and pitied  my confusion  and generously relieved me from it by changing the subject  she talked of my father  of his merit  his tenderness for me  and expectations of my conduct  which she was sure I should never disappoint  Without hinting at what had past  she with the utmost exquisite delicacy gave me to understand it would be best I should leave Rome  by saying she knew how ardently my father wished for my return           1 27       and that it would be the height of cruelty longer to deprive him of the pleasure of seeing a son so worthy of his affection   The Count and myself   pursued she   cannot lose you without inexpressible regret  but you will alleviate it by letting us hear often of your welfare  When you are united to a lady worthy of you  my dear Enrico  we may perhaps make you a visit in England  in the mean time  be assured  you have not two friends who love you with a sincerer affection       At this moment the Count entered  who  seeing my eyes filled with tears of love  despair  and admiration  with the tenderest anxiety enquired the cause   I shall tell you news which will afflict you  my Lord   said the Countess   Signor Enrico comes to bid us farewel  he is commanded by his father to return to England  tomorrow is the last day of his stay in Rome  he promises to write to us  and          1 28       to preserve an eternal remembrance of our friendship
