as himself  Being thus supported  he went to work  and arms and legs were hewed down without mercy —The fumes of the liquor mounting into the parson s brain  conspired with his former agitation of spirits  to make him quite delirious  he stript himself to the skin  and besmearing his body with blood  could scarce be with held from running upon deck in that condition  Jack Rattlin  scandalized at this deportment  endeavoured to allay his transports with reason  but finding all he said ineffectual  and great confusion occasioned by his frolicks  he knocked him down with his right hand  and by threats kept him quiet in that state of humiliation —But it was not in the power of rum to elevate the purser  who sat on the floor wringing his hands  and cursing the hour in which he left his peaceable profession of a brewer in Rochester  to engage in   287 such a life of terror and disquiet —While we diverted ourselves at the expence of this poor devil  a shot happened to take us between wind and water  and its course being through the purser s store room  made a terrible havock and noise among the jars and bottles in its way  and disconcerted Mackshane so much  that he dropt his scalpel  and falling down on his knees  pronounced his Pater noster aloud  the purser fell backward and lay without sense or motion  and the chaplain grew so outrageous  that Rattlin with one hand  could not keep him under  so that we were obliged to confine him in the surgeon s cabbin  where he was no doubt guilty of a thousand extravagancies —Much about this time  my old antagonist Crampley came down  with express orders  as he said  to bring me up to the quarterdeck  to dress a slight wound the captain had received by a splinter  His reason for honouring me in particular with this piece of service  being that in case I should be killed or disabled by the way  my death or mutilation would be of less consequence to the ship s company  than that of the doctor or his first mate —At another time  perhaps  I might have disputed this order  to which I was not bound to pay the least regard  but as I thought my reputation depended upon my compliance  I was resolved to convince my rival that I was no more afraid than he  to expose myself to danger —With this view  I provided myself with dressings  and followed him immediately to the quarter deck  through a most infernal scene of slaughter  fire  smoak  and uproar  Captain Oakhum  who leaned against the mizen mast  no sooner 〈◊〉 me approach in my shirt  with the sleeves t…ed up to my arm pits    288 and my hands dyed with blood  than he signified his displeasure by a frown  and asked why the doctor himself did not come  I told him Crampley had singled me out  as if by his express command  at which he seemed surprized  and threatened to punish the midshipman for his presumption  after the engagement  In the mean time  I was sent back to my station  and ordered to tell Mackshane  that the captain expected him immediately —I got safe back and delivered up my commission to the doctor  who flatly refused to quit the post assigned to him by his instructions  Hereupon  Morgan  who  I believe  was jealous of my reputation for courage  undertook the affair  and ascended with great intrepidity —The captain finding the surgeon obstinate  suffered himself to be dressed  and swore he would confine Mackshane as soon as that service should be over       289  CHAP  XXXIII   A breach being made in the walls  our soldiers give the assault  take the place without opposition—our sailors at the same time become masters of all the other strengths near Bocca Chica  and take possession of the harbour—the good consequence of this success—we move nearer the town—find two forts deserted  and the channel blocked up with sunk vessels  which however  we find means to clear—land our soldiers at La Quinta—repulse a body of militia—attack the castle of St  Lazar  and are forced to retreat with great loss—the remains of our army are re imbarked—an effort of the admiral to take the Town—the oeconomy of our expedition described   HAVING cannonaded the fort  during the space of four hours  we were all ordered to slip our cables  and sheer off  but next day the engagement was renewed  and continued from the morning till the afternoon  when the enemy s fire from Bocca Chica slackened  and towards evening was quite silenced —A breach being made on the other side  by our land battery  large enough to admit a middle sized baboon    290 provided he could find means to climb up to it  our general proposed to give the assault that very night  and actually ordered a detachment on that duty  Providence stood our friend upon this occasion  and put it into the hearts of the Spaniards to abandon the fort  which might have been maintained by resolute men  to the day of judgment against all the force we could exert in the attack —And while our soldiers took possession of the enemy s ramparts  without resistance  the same good luck attended a body of sailors
