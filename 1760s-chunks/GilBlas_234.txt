so uncouth in the arrangement  as to baffle all conjecture about the meaning  He saw how it puzzled me  This sonnet then  said he  is not quite level to your comprehension  Is not that the fact  I owned that I should have preferred a construction somewhat less forced  He began laughing at my rusticity  Well  then  replied he  we will say that this sonnet would confuse clearer heads than thine  it is all the better for that Sonnets  odes  in short all compositions which partake of the sublime  are of course the reverse of the simple and natural  they are enveloped in clouds  and their darkness constitutes their grandeur  Let the poet only fancy that be understands himself no matter whether his readers understand him or not  You are laughing at me  my friend  said I  interrupting him  Let poetry be of what species it may  good sense and intelligible diction are essential to its powers of pleasing  If your peerless Gongora is not a little more lucid than yourself  I protest that his merit will never pass current with me  Such poets may entrap their own age into applause  but will never live beyond it  Now let me have a taste of your prose   Nunez shewed me a preface which he meant to prefix to a dramatic miscellany then in the press  He insisted on having my opinion  I like not your prose one atom better than your verse  said I  Your sonnet is a roaring deluge of emptiness  and as for your preface  it is disfigured by a phraseology stolen from languages yet in embryo  by words not stamped in the mint of general use  by all the perplexity of a style that does not know what to make of itself  In a word  the composition is altogether a thing of your own  Our classical and standard books are written in a very different manner  Poor tasteless wretch  exclaimed Fabricio  You are not aware that every prose writer who aspires to the reputation of sentiment and delicacy in these days  affects this style of his own  these perplexities and innovations which are a stumbling block to you  There are five or six of us determined reformers of our language  who have undertaken to turn the Spanish idiom topsy turvy  and with a blessing on our endeavours  we will pull it down and build it up again in defiance of Lope de Vega  Cervantes  and all the host of wits who cavil at our new modes of speech  Our party is strongly supported in the fashionable world  and we have laid violent hands upon the pulpit   After all  continued he  our project is commendable  for  to speak without prejudice  we have ten times the merit of those natural writers  who express themselves just like the mob  I cannot conceive why so many sensible men are taken with them  It is all very well at Athens and at Rome  in a wild and undistinguishing democracy  and on that principle only could Socrates tell Alcibiades  that the last appeal was to the people in all disputes about language  But at Madrid there is a polite and a vulgar usage  so that our courtiers talk in a different tongue from their tradesmen  You may assure yourself that it is so  in fine  this newly invented style is carrying everything before it  and turning old nature out of doors  Now I will explain to you by a single instance the difference between the elegance of our diction and the flatness of theirs  They would say  for example  in plain terms   Ballets incidental to the piece are an ornament to a play   but in our mode of expression  we say more exquisitely   Ballets incidental to the piece are the very life and soul of the play   Now observe the phrase  life and soul  Are you sensible how glowing it is  at the same time how descriptive  setting before you all the motions of the dancers  as on an intellectual stage   I broke in upon my reformer of language with a burst of laughter  Get along with you  Fabricio  said I  you are a coxcomb of your own manufacture  with your affected finery of phrase  And you  answered he  are a blockhead of nature s clumsy moulding  with your starch simplicity  He then went on taunting me with the archbishop of Grenada s angry banter on my dismission   Get about your business  Go and tell my treasurer to pay you a hundred ducats  and take my blessing in addition to that sum  God speed you  good master Gil Blas  I heartily pray that you may do well in the world  There is no thing to stand in your way  but a little better taste   I roared out in a still louder explosion of laughter at this lucky hit  and Fabricio  easily appeased on the score of impiety  as manifested in the opinion expressed concerning his writings  lost nothing of his pleasant and propitious temper  We got to the bottom of our second bottle  and then rose from the table in fine order for an adventure  Our first intention was to see what was to be seen upon the Prado  but passing in front of a liquor shop  it came into
