commander of the Fune and his own second  to make a descent   31 upon another island belonging to the Chinese  called Qua chu  where they assured him he would meet with no opposition  As he had no dream to deter him from this attempt  he suffered himself to be persuaded  and actually made good his landing  but the horror occasioned by the apparition of his grand mother  had made such an impression upon his mind  as affected the constitution of his body  Before he was visited by another such vision  he sickened and died  and in consequence of his death  Rha rin tumm and He Rhumn made a conquest of the island of Qua Chu  which was much more valuable than Thin quo  the first and sole object of the expedition —When the first news of this second descent arrived in Japan  the ministry were in the utmost confusion  Mr  Orator Taycho did not scruple to declare   32 that general Hobnob had misbehaved  first  in relinquishing Thin quo  upon such a frivolous pretence as the supposed apparition of an old woman  secondly  in attempting the conquest of another place  which was not so much as mentioned in his instructions  The truth is  the importance of Qua chu was not known to the cabinet of Japan  Fika kaka believed it was some place on the continent of Tartary  and exclaimed in a violent passion     Rot the block head  Hob nob  he ll have an army of Chinese on his back in a twinkling    When the president Soo san sin o assured him that Qua chu was a rich island at an immense distance from the continent of Tartary  the Cuboy insisted upon kissing his excellency s posteriors for the agreeable information he had received  In a few weeks arrived the   33 tidings of the island s being totally reduced by Rha rin tumm and He Rhumn —Then the conquest was published throughout the empire of Japan with every circumstance of exaggeration  The blatant beast brayed applause  The rites of Fakkubasi were celebrated with unusual solemnity  and hymns of triumph were sung to the glory of the great Taycho  Even the Cuboy arrogated to himself some share of the honour gained by this expedition  inasmuch as the general Rha rin tumm was the brother of his friend Mr  Secretary No bo dy  Fika kaka gave a grand entertainment at his palace  where he appeared crowned with a garland of the Tsikkburasiba  or laurel of Japan  and eat so much of the soup of Joniku or famous Swallow s nest  that he was for three days troubled with flatulencies and indigestion       34 In the midst of all this festivity  the emperor still growled and grumbled about Yesso  His new ally Brut an tiffi had met with a variety of fortune  and even suffered some shocks  which orator Taycho  with all his art  could not keep from the knowledge of the Dairo —He had been severely drubbed by the Mant choux  who had advanced for that purpose even to his court yard  but this was nothing in comparison to another disaster  from which he had a hair breadth  scape  The Great Khan had employed one of his most wily and enterprising chiefs to seize Brut an tiffi by surprize  that he might be brought to justice  and executed as a felon and perturbator of the public peace  Kunt than  who was the partisan pitched upon for this service  practised a thousand stratagems to decoy Brut an tiffi into a careless security  but he was still   35 baffled by the vigilance of Yam a Kheit  a famous soldier of fortune  who had engaged in the service of the outlawed Tartar  At length the opportunity offered  when this captain was sent out to lay the country under contribution  Then Kunt than marching solely in the dead of night  caught Brut an tiffi napping  He might have slain him upon the spot  but his orders were to take him alive  that he might be made a public example  accordingly  his centinels being dispatched  he was pulled out of bed  and his hands were already tied with cords  like those of a common malefactor  when  by his roaring and bellowing  he gave the alarm to Yam a Kheit  who chanced to be in the neighbourhood  returning from his excursion —He made all the haste he could  and came up in the very nick of time to save his master  He fell upon the party of Kunt than   36 with such fury  that they were fain to quit their prey  then he cut the fetters of Brut an tiffi  who took to his heels and fled with incredible expedition  leaving his preserver in the midst of his enemies  by whom he was overpowered  struck from his horse  and trampled to death  The grateful Tartar not only deserted this brave captain in such extremity  but he also took care to asperse his memory  by insinuating that Yam a Kheit had undertaken to watch him while he took his repose  and had himself fallen asleep upon his post  by which neglect of duty the Ostrog had been enabled to penetrate into his quarters   Tis an ill wind that blows no body good —the same disaster that deprived him of a good officer  afforded him an opportunity to shift
