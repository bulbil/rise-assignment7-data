its antipathy to the Ximian favourite  This had become so habitual  that it acted mechanically upon its organs  even after it had lost all other signs of recognition  As often as the name of Yak strot was pronounced  the Beast began to yell  and all the usual consequences ensued  but whenever his new friends presumed to mount him  he threw himself on his back  and rolled them in the kennel at the hazard of their lives   One would imagine there was some leaven in the nature of Yakstrot    177 that soured all his subalterns who were natives of Niphon  for howsoever they promised all submission to his will before they were admitted into his motion  they no sooner found themselves acting characters in his drama  than they began to thwart him in his measures  so that he was plagued by those he had taken in  and persecuted by those he had driven out  The two great props which he had been at so much pains to provide  now failed him  Taycho was grown crazy  and could no longer manage the monster  and Quam bacundono the Fatzman  whose authority had kept several puppets in awe  died about this period  These two circumstances were the more alarming  as Gotto mio and his crew began to gain ground  not only in their endeavours to rouse the Monster  but also in tampering with some of the acting puppets  to join their cabal   178 and make head against their master  These exoterics grew so refractory  that when he tried to wheel them to the right  they turned to the left about  and  instead of joining hands in the dance of politics  rapped their heads against each other with such violence  that the noise of the collision was heard in the street  and if they had not been made of the hardest wood in Japan  some of them would certainly have been split in the encounter   By this time Legionbegan to have some sense of its own miserable condition  The effects of the yeast potions which it had drank so liberally from the hands of Taycho  now wore off  The fumes dispersed  the illusion vanished  the flatulent tumor of its belly disappeared with innumerable explosions  leaving a hideous lankness and such a canine appetite as all the eatables of Japan could not satisfy    179 After having devoured the whole harvest  it yawned for more  and grew quite outrageous in its hunger  threatening to feed on human flesh  if not plentifully supplied with other viands  In this dilemma Yak strot convened the council of Twenty Eight  where  in consideration of the urgency of the case  it was resolved to suspend the law against the importation of foreign provisions  and open the ports of Japan for the relief of the blatant Beast   As this was vesting the Dairo with a dispensing power unknown to the constitution of Japan  it was thought necessary at the next assembly of the Quos and Quanbukus that constitute the legislature  to obtain a legal sanction for that extraordinary exercise of prerogative  which nothing but the salus populi could excuse  Upon this occasion it was diverting to see with what effrontery individuals   180 changed their principles with their places  Taycho the Quo  happening to be in one of his lucid intervals  went to the assembly  supported by his two creatures Praff fog  and another limb of the law  called Lley nah  surnamed Gurg grog  or Curse mother  and this triumvirate  who had raised themselves from nothing to the first rank in the state  by vilifying and insulting the kingly power  and affirming that the Dairo was the slave of the people  now had the impudence to declare in the face of day  that in some cases the emperor s power was absolute  and that he had an inherent right to suspend and supersede the laws and ordinances of the legislature   Mura clami  who had been for some time eclipsed in his judicial capacity by the popularity of Praff fog  did not fail to seize this opportunity of exposing the character of his upstart rival    181 Though he had been all his life an humble retainer to the prerogative  he now made a parade of patriotism  and in a tide of eloquence bore down all the flimsy arguments which the triumvirate advanced  He demonstrated the futility of their reasoning  from the express laws and customs of the empire  he expatiated on the pernicious tendency of their doctrine  and exhibited the inconsistency of their conduct in such colours  that they must have hid their heads in confusion  had they not happily conquered all sense of shame  and been well convinced that the majority of the assembly were not a whit more honest than themselves  Mura clami enjoyed a momentary triumph  but his words made a very slight impression  for it was his misfortune to be a Ximian  and if his virtues had been more numerous than   182 the hairs in his beard  this very circumstance would have shaved them clean away from the consideration of the audience   Taycho  opening the flood gates of his abuse  bespattered all that opposed him  Lleynah  alias Curse mother  swore that he had got into the wrongbox  then turning to Praff fog     Brother Praff   cried he  thou hast now let down thy trowsers
