already experienced the misery of dependent greatness  that kept him   continually under the eye of a capricious tyrant  whose temper was   various as the gales of summer  and whose anger was sudden as the bolt   of heaven  whose purpose and passions were dark and impetuous as the   midnight storm  and at whose command death was inevitable as the   approach of time  When he saw ALMORAN  therefore  in the likeness of   HAMET  he felt a secret desire to apprize him of his situation  and   offer him his friendship       ALMORAN  who with the form assumed the manners of HAMET  addressed Osmyn   with a mild though mournful countenance   At length   said he   the will   of ALMORAN alone is law  does it permit me to hold a private rank in   this place  without molestation    It permits   said Osmyn   yet more    he has commanded  that you should have admittance to ALMEIDA   ALMORAN    whose vanity betrayed him to flatter his own power in the person of   HAMET  replied with a smile   I know  that ALMORAN  who presides like a   God in silent and distant state  reveals the secrets of his will to   thee  I know that thou art    I am   said Osmyn   of all thou seest    most wretched   At this declaration  ALMORAN turned short  and fixed his   eyes upon Osmyn with a look of surprize and anger   Does not the favour   of ALMORAN   said he   whose smile is power  and wealth  and honour    shine upon thee    My lord   said Osmyn   I know so well the severity of   thy virtue  that if I should  even for thy sake  become perfidious to   thy brother   ALMORAN  who was unable to preserve the character of HAMET   with propriety  interrupted him with a fierce and haughty tone   How     said he   perfidious to my brother  to ALMORAN perfidious        Osmyn  who had now gone too far to recede  and who still saw before him   the figure of HAMET  proceeded in his purpose   I knew   said he   that   in thy judgment I should be condemned  and yet  the preservation of life   is the strongest principle of nature  and the love of virtue is her   proudest boast    Explain thyself   said ALMORAN   for I cannot   comprehend thee    I mean   said Osmyn   that he  whose life depends   upon the caprice of a tyrant  is like the wretch whose sentence is   already pronounced  and who  if the wind does but rush by his dungeon    imagines that it is the bow string and the mute    Fear not   said   ALMORAN  who now affected to be again calm   be still faithful  and thou   shalt still be safe    Alas   said Osmyn  there is no diligence  no   toil  no faith  that can secure the slave from the sudden phrensy of   passion  from  the causeless rage either of drunkenness or lust  I am   that slave  the slave of a tyrant whom I hate   The confusion of ALMORAN   was now too great to be concealed  and he stood silent with rage  fear    and indignation  Osmyn  supposing that his wonder suspended his belief   of what he had heard  confirmed his declaration by an oath       Whoever thou art  to whose mind ALMORAN  the mighty and the proud  is   present  before whom  the lord of absolute dominion stands trembling and   rebuked  who seest the possessor of power by which nature is controuled    pale and silent with anguish and disappointment  if  in the fury of thy   wrath  thou hast aggravated weakness into guilt  if thou hast chilled   the glow of affection  when it flushed the cheek in thy presence  with   the frown of displeasure  or repressed the ardour of friendship with   indifference or neglect  now  let thy heart smite thee  for  in thy   folly  thou hast cast away that gem  which is the light of life  which   power can never seize  and which gold can never buy       The tyrant fell at once from his pride  like a star from Heaven  and   Osmyn  still addressing him as HAMET  at once increased his misery and   his fears   O   said he   that the throne of Persia was thine  then   should innocence enjoy her birth right of peace  and hope should bid   honest industry look upward  There is not one to whom ALMORAN has   delegated
