had of his zeal and attachment  desiring to see him often at  his levee  that  in the multiplicity of business  he might not be in  danger of forgetting his services and desert   CHAPTER XC    Peregrine commences Minister s Dependant  Meets by Accident with Mrs   Gauntlet  And descends gradually in the Condition of Life   This reception  favourable as it was  did not please Peregrine  who had  too much discernment to be cajoled with general promises  at a time  when he thought himself entitled to the most particular assurance  He  accordingly signified his disgust to his introductor  giving him  to understand  that he had laid his account with being chosen  representative of one of those boroughs for which he had been  sacrificed  His lordship agreed to the reasonableness of his  expectation  observing  however  that he could not suppose the minister  would enter upon business with him on his first visit  and that it  would be time enough at his next audience to communicate his demand   Notwithstanding this remonstrance  our hero continued to indulge his  suspicion and chagrin  and even made a point of it with his patron  that  his lordship should next day make application on his behalf  lest the  two seats should be filled up  on pretence of his inclinations being  unknown  Thus importuned  my lord went to his principal  and returned  with an answer  importing that his honour was extremely sorry that Mr   Pickle had not signified his request before the boroughs in question  were promised to two gentlemen whom he could not now disappoint  with  any regard to his own credit or interest  but  as several persons who  would be chosen were  to his certain knowledge  very aged and infirm  he  did not doubt that there would be plenty of vacant seats in a very short  time  and then  the young gentleman might depend upon his friendship     6 22 15  3 45 PM   Peregrine was so much irritated at this intimation  that  in the first  transports of his anger he forgot the respect he owed his friend  and  in his presence inveighed against the minister  as a person devoid of  gratitude and candour  protesting  that if ever an opportunity should  offer itself  he would spend the whole remains of his fortune in  opposing his measures  The nobleman having given him time to exhaust  the impetuosity of his passion  rebuked him very calmly for his  disrespectful expressions  which were equally injurious and indiscreet   assured him that this project of revenge  if ever put in execution   would redound to his own prejudice and confusion  and advised him to  cultivate and improve  with patience and assiduity  the footing he had  already obtained in the minister s good graces   Our hero  convinced of the truth  though not satisfied with the occasion  of his admonitions  took his leave in a fit of sullen discontent  and  began to ruminate upon the shattered posture of his affairs  All that  now remained of the ample fortune he had inherited was the sum he had  deposited in his lordship s hands  together with fifteen hundred pounds  he had ventured on bottomry  and the garrison  which he had left for the  use and accommodation of the lieutenant  and  on the per contra side  of his account  he was debtor for the supply he had received from the  receiver general  and the money for which he was bound in behalf of his  friend  so that he found himself  for the first time of his life  very  much embarrassed in his circumstances  For  of the first half year s  interest of his ten thousand  which was punctually paid  he had but  fourscore pounds in bank  without any prospect of a farther supply  till the other term  which was at the distance of four long months  He  seriously reflected upon the uncertainty of human affairs  the ship with  his fifteen hundred pounds might be lost  the gentleman for whom he was  security might miscarry in this  as well as in his former projects  and  the minister might one day  through policy or displeasure  expose him to  the mercy of his dependant  who was in possession of his notes   These suggestions did not at all contribute to the ease of our  adventurer s mind  already ruffled by his disappointment  He cursed  his own folly and extravagance  by which he was reduced to such an  uncomfortable situation  He compared his own conduct with that of some  young gentlemen of his acquaintance  who  while he was squandering  away the best part of his inheritance  had improved their fortunes   strengthened their interest  and increased their reputation  He was  abandoned by his gaiety and good humour  his countenance gradually  contracted itself into a representation of severity and care  he dropped  all his amusements and the companions of his pleasure  and turned his  whole attention to the minister  at whose levees he never failed to  appear   While he thus laboured in the wheel of dependence  with
