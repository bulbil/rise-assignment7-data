hearty salutations  as if they had not met for these ten years  After that  Don Ferdinand  a professed bacchanalian  made his proposals to Don Matthias and Don Antonio  Gentlemen  said he  where do you dine to day  If you are not engaged  I will take you to a tavern  where you shall quaff celestial liquor  I supped there last night  and did not come away till between five and six this morning  Would to heaven  exclaimed my master  I had done the same  I should not have lost my money   For my part  said Centell√©s  I treated myself yesterday evening with a new amusement  for variety has always its charms for me  Nothing but a change of pleasures can make the dull round of human life supportable  One of my friends introduced me neck and heels to one of those gentry ycleped tax gatherers  who do the government business and their own at the same time  There was no want of magnificence  good taste  or a well designed set out table  but I found in the family itself an highly seasoned relish of absurdity  The farmer of the revenues  though the most meanly extracted of the whole party  must set up for a great man  and his wife  though hideously ugly  was a goddess in her own estimation  and made a thousand silly speeches  the zest of which was heightened by a Biscayan accent  Add to this  that there were four or five children with their tutor at table  Judge if it must not have been an amusing family party   As for me  gentlemen  said Don Alexo Segiar  I supped with Arsenia the actress  We were six at table  Arsenia  Florimonde  a coquette of her acquaintance  the Marquis de Zenette  Don Juan de Moncade  and your humble servant  We passed the night in drinking and talking bawdy  What a flow of soul  To be sure  Arsenia and Florimonde are not strong in their upper works  but then they have a facility in their vocation which is more than all the wit in the world  They are the dearest madcaps  gay  romping  and rampant  they are an hundred times better than your modest women of sense and discretion       CH  IV     Gil Blas gets into company with his fellows  they shew him a ready road to the reputation of wit  and impose on him a singular oath   THOSE noblemen pursued this strain of conversation  till Don Matthias  about whose person I was fiddling all the while  was ready to go out  He then told me to follow him  and this bevy of fashionables set sail together for the tavern  whither Don Ferdinand de Gamboa proposed to conduct them  I began my march in the rear rank with three other valets  for each of the gentlemen had his own  I remarked with astonishment that these three servants copied their masters  and assumed the same follies  I introduced myself as a new comer  They returned my salute in form  and one of them  after having taken measure of me very accurately  said    Brother  I perceive  by your gait  that you have never yet lived with a young nobleman  Alas  no  answered I  neither have I been long in Madrid  So it appears  replied he  you smell strong of the country  You seem timid and embarrassed  there is an hitch in your deportment  But no matter  we will soon wear off all stiffness  take my word for it  Perhaps you think better of me than I deserve  said I  No  resumed he  no  there is no such cub as we cannot lick into shape  assure yourself of that   This specimen was enough to convince me that I had hearty fellows for my comrades  and that I could not be in better hands to initiate me into high life below stairs  On our arrival at the tavern  we found an entertainment ready which Signor Don Ferdinand had been so provident as to order in the morning  Our masters sat down to table  and we arranged ourselves behind their chairs  The conversation was spirited and lively  My ears tingled to hear them  Their humour  their way of thinking  their mode of expression diverted me  What fire  what sallies of imagination  They appeared like a new order of beings  With the dessert  we set before them a great choice of the best wines in Spain  and left the room  to go to dinner in a little parlour  where our cloth was laid   I was not long in discovering that the combatants in our lists had more to recommend them than appeared at first sight  They were not satisfied with aping the manners of their masters  but even copied their phrases  and these varlets gave such a facsimile  that bating a little vulgarity  they might have passed themselves off very well  I admired their free and easy carriage  still more was I charmed with their wit  but despaired of ever coming up to them in my own person  Don Ferdinand s servant  on the score of his master treating ours  did the honours  and  determined to do
