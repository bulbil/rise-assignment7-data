recollect during that period when or whether I   received any kind of sustenance      At length I awoke to the poignancy and bitterness of my   situation  I did not awake to life  but rather to the blackest   gloom of the regions of death  and yet it was from this depth   and enfolding of death alone that my soul could find or would   accept an alleviation of its anguish      earth   I cried  where is thy centre   How deeply am I sunk   beneath it  how are the worms exalted over me  how much   higher are the noxious reptiles that crawl upon earth   I will not   accuse thee  thou great Disposer  I have had my day the   sweetest that ever was allotted to man   but O  thy past blessings   serve only to enhance my present miseries   and to render me the   most accursed of all thy creatures       1 then rose  and threw myself along the floor  and my faithful   and valiant companions immediately gathered to me   but finding   that I would not be removed  they cast themselves around me      All light was shut out save the glimmering of a taper   and for   seven nights and seven days we dwelt in silence  except the solemn   interruptions of smothered sobs and wailings      At length my spirit reproved me  What property  said I to   myself  have these people in my sufferings  or why should I burden   those who love me with my afflictions   I then constrained myself    and went and took out a drawer  Here  my friends  I said  here is   something that may help hereafter to dry up your tears  Divide   these thousands among you   neither these counters nor your ser    vices are now of further use  Fare ye well   fare ye well   my   worthy and beloved brothers   God will give you a more gracious   master  but but such another mistress you never never will   find   I then took each of them to my arms  and kissed them   in turns  and the house was instantly filled with heart tearing   lamentations      I now expected and wished to be left wholly alone   but James   and two domestics remained against my will  I then endeavoured   to seem easy I even struggled to appear cheerful  that I might   communicate the less of grief to the voluntary sharers in my   misery  O world  world  I said to myself  thou once pleasant   world  we have now bid a long and eternal adieu to each other    From thee I am cut asunder thou art annihilated to me and we   mutually reject every kind of future commerce      Ah   how much deeper was my death than that of those in the   tomb  where the wicked cease from troubling  and where the   weary are at rest     While I was dead to every relish of light   and of life  I was wholly alive to all the gloom and horrors of   the grave  The rays of the sun became an offence to my soul the   verdure of the fields  the whole bloom of nature  was blasted and   blasting to my sight   and I wished to sink yet deeper  and to dig   a lower bottom to myself of darkness and distress      I no longer regarded what the world thought of me  or what   it did to me  and I left my hairs and my nails  even as those         THE FOOL OF QUALITY          393         of Nebuchadnezzar  to grow like eagles  feathers and birds    claws      My friend James  in the mean time  took a place for me in this   town  in order to remove me from scenes that could only servo   to perpetuate or aggravate my misery  by reminding me of the   blessedness that I had once enjoyed  He was now become my   controller  I was patient and passive to any thing to every   thing   and so he conducted me hither I neither knew nor cared   how      In all this time  though I panted after a state of insensibility    even as a traveller in the burning desert thirsts after a cool and   slaking stream  I never attempted to lay a violating hand on the   work of my Creator  I did not even wish an alleviation of my   misery  since my God had appointed that I should be so very   miserable      At length my spirit rose from its blackness to a kind of calm   twilight
