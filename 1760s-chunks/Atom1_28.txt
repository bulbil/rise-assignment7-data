regard for thy interest  O Quamba cun dono  Quamba cun dono  how hast thou disappointed my hope  I thought thou wast too ponderous to flinch  that thou wouldst have stood thy ground fixed as the temple of Fakkubasi  and larded the lean earth with thy carcase  rather than leave my farm uncovered  but  alas  thou hast fled before the enemy like a partridge on the mountains  and suffered thyself at last to be taken in a snare like a foolish dotterel      The Cuboy  who overheard this exclamation  attempted to comfort him through the key hole  He soothed  and whined  and wheedled  and laughed and wept all in a breath  He exhorted the illustrious Got hama baba to bear this misfortune with his wonted greatness of mind —He offered to present his Imperial majesty with lands in Japan    154 that should be equal in value to the farm he had lost  or  if that should not be agreeable  to make good at the peace  all the damage that should be done to it by the enemy  Finally  he cursed the farm  as the cause of his master s chagrin  and fairly wished it at the devil —Here he was suddenly interrupted with a    Bub ub ub boh  my lord Cuboy  your grace talks like an apothecary —Go home to your own palace  and direct your cooks  and may your bonzes kiss your a—to your heart s content —I swear by the horns of the Moon and the hoofs of the White Horse  that my foot shall not touch your posteriors these three days    —Fika kaka  having received this severe check  craved pardon in a whimpering tone  for the liberty he had taken  and retired to consult with Mura clami  who advised him to summon orator Taycho to his assistance        155 This mob driver being made acquainted with the passion of the Dairo  and the cause of his distress  readily undertook to make such a speech through the key hole  as should effectually dispel the emperor s despondence  and to this enterprize he was encouraged by the hyperbolical praises of Mura clami  who exhausted all the tropes of his own rhetoric in extolling the eloquence of Taycho —This triumvirate immediately adjourned to the door of the apartment in which Got hama baba was seqestered  where the orator kneeling upon a cushion  with his mouth applied to the key hole  opened the sluices of his elocution to this effect      Most gracious    Bo  bo  boh  — Most illustrious    Bo  boh  — Most invincible Got hama baba  — Boh  — When the sun  that glorious luminary is obscured  by    156 envious clouds  all nature saddens  and seems to sympathize with his apparent distress —Your Imperial majesty is the sun of our hemisphere  whose splendour illuminates our throne  and whose genial warmth enlivens our hearts  and shall we your subjects  your slaves  the creatures of your nod—shall we unmoved behold your ever glorious effulgence overcast  No  while the vital stream bedews our veins  while our souls retain the faculty of reason  and our tongues the power of speech  we shall not cease to embalm your sorrow with our tears  we shall not cease to pour the overflowings of our affection—our filial tenderness  which will always be reciprocal with your parental care  these are the inexhaustible sources of the nation s happiness  They may be compared to the rivers Jodo and Jodogava  which derive their common    157 origin from the vast lake of Ami  The one winds its silent course  calm  clear  and majestic  reflecting the groves and palaces that adorn its banks  and fertilizing the delightful country through which it runs  the other gushes impetuous through a rugged channel and less fertile soil  yet serves to beautify a number of wild romantic scenes  to fill an hundred aqueducts  and to turn a thousand mills  at length  they join their streams below the imperial city of Meaco  and form a mighty flood devolving to the bay of Osaca  bearing on its spacious bosom  the riches of Japan    —Here the orator paused for breath —the Cuboy clapped him on the back  whispering    Super excellent  O charming simile  Another such will sink the Dairo s grief to the bottom of the sea  and his heart will float like a blown bladder upon    158 the waves of Kugava    Mura clami was not silent in his praise  while he squeezed an orange between the lips of Taycho  and Got hama baba seemed all attention  at length the orator resumed his subject — Think not  august emperor  that the cause of your disquiet is unknown  or unlamented by your weeping servants  We have not only perceived your eclipse  but discovered the invidious body by whose interposition that eclipse is effected  The rapacious arms of the hostile Chinese have seized the farm of Yesso —   Oh  oh  oh    —that farm so cherished by your Imperial favour  that farm which  in the north of Tartary  shone like a jewel in an Aethiop s ear —yes  that jewel hath been snatched by the savage hand of a Chinese free booter —but
