compared me   Do you wonder  Lucy  that I cannot hold up my head  when I recollect the figure I must make in that odious Masquerade habit  hanging by my clasping arms about the neck of such a young gentleman  Can I be more effectually humbled than by such a recollection  And yet is not this an instance of that false shame in me  to which Sir Charles Grandison is so greatly superior     258 Surely  surely  I have had my punishment for my compliances with this foolish world  False glory  and false shame  the poor Harriet has never been totally above  Why was I so much indulged  Why was I allowed to stop so many miles short of my journey▪s end  and then complimented  as if I had no farther to go —but surely  I was past all shame  when I gave my consent to make such an appearance  as I made  among a thousand strangers  at a Masquerade   But now  I think  something offers of blame in the character of this almost faultless man  as his sister  and her Jenny  represent him to be   I cannot think  from a hint given by Miss Grandison  that he is quite so frank  and so unreserved  as his sister is  Nay  it was more than a hint  I will repeat her very words  She had been mentioning her own openness of heart  and yet confessing that she would have kept one or two things from him  that affected him not     But as for my brother  said she  he winds one about  and about  yet seems not to have more curiosity than one would wish him to have  Led on by his smiling benignity  and fond of his attention to my prattle  I have caught myself in the midst of a tale of which I intended not to tell him one syllable        O Sir Charles  where am I got  have I said  and suddenly stopt        Proceed  my Charlotte  No reserves to your nearest friend        Yet he has his  and I have winded and winded about him  as he had done about me  but all to no purpose        Nevertheless  he has found means  insensibly  to set me on again with my own story  till I had told him all I knew of the matter  and all the time I was intending only that my frankness should be an example to him  when he  instead of answering my wishes  double locked the door of his heart  and left   259 not so much as the key hole uncovered  by which I might have peeped into it  and this in one or two points  that I thought it imported me to know  And then have I been ready to scold      Now this reserve to such a sister  and in points that she thinks it imports her to know  is what I do not like in Sir Charles  A friend as well as sister  ought there to be a secret on on• side  when there is none on the other  Very likely  he would be as reserved to a wife  And is not marriage the highest state of friendship that mortals can know  And can friendship and reserve be compatible  Surely  No   His sister  who cannot think he has one fault  excuses him  and says  that her brother has no other view in drawing her on to reveal her own heart  but the better to know how to serve and oblige her   But then  might not the same thing be said in behalf of the curiosity of so generous a sister  Or  is Sir Charles so conscious of his own superiority  as to think he can give advice to her  but wants not hers to him  Or  thinks he meanly of our Sex  and highly of his own  Yet there are but two years difference in their age  And from sixteen to twenty four  I believe women are generally more than two years aforehand with the men in ripeness of understanding  tho   after that time  the men may ripen into a superiority   This observation is not my own  for I heard a very wise man once say  That the intellects of women usually ripen sooner than those of men  but that those of men  when ripened  like trees of slow growth  generally hold longer  are capable of higher perfection  and serve to nobler purposes   Sir Charles has seen more of the world  it may be said  than his sister has  He has travelled  But is not human nature the same in every country  allowing only for different customs —Do not Love  hatred  anger  malice  all the passions in short  good or bad  shew themselves by like effects in the faces  hearts    260 and actions of the people of every country  And let men make ever such strong pretensions to knowledge  from their far fetch d and dear bought experience  cannot a penetrating spirit learn as much from the passions of a Sir Hargrave Pollexfen
