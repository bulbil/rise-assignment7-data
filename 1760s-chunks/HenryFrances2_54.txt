am at present surrounded with  I am indeed utterly incapable of answering your very elegant Treatise  but  incumbered as I am with Multitudes  I can love and thank you for it  Indeed  my sweet Love  you can reconcile me to any Misfortune  but your Absence  for  while you prove  from Philosophy and Religion  the trifling Value  we ought to set on what are called the good Things of this Life  you still inhance your own  My Love  my Friendship  my Esteem  seem to increase daily  though it is long since I thought I had arrived at the highest Degree of each  for thee  my Life  my Love   I thank you for your intended Present  I doubt not their being excellent  but  alas  unshared by thee  what Delicacy can please  Haste then  my Love  to give me a Relish for every Enjoyment  for I neither know  wish  nor hope for any  but in thee   While I pressed the dear Spot  which thou hadst blessed with the Impression of thy Lips  I found a Joy  which might indeed be felt even Page  203 by angelic Natures  unmixed with any Passion  that might disgrace an Angel  my Soul seemed ready to issue at my Lips  in hopes of meeting thine  None  but those who love like you and me  can have an Idea of such Pleasures   I have spent the Day at your Brother s  where there are a little Hundred met to be merry  They pity my Melancholy  for  indeed  I am not gay  But I feel a higher Satisfaction  than the broadest Mirth is capable of  in subscribing myself  faithfully and affectionately   Your s  Frances   LETTER CCLIII  HENRY to FRANCES   I AM at a Loss to know  whether my Love or Pride is most gratified at your kind Acceptance of those little occasional Essays  which I sometimes send you  for your Amusement  or Guidance in Life  but I shall refer the Satisfaction to my Love  as that comprehends my best and highest Pride too  It is but just in me to make you some Return of that Philosophy  which you have taught me  But in this Science you are infinitely my Superior  for I can but create in you a Disregard for the Things stiled Page  204 of this World  merely by shewing their Trivialness and Vanity in themselves  but you have inspired me with an utter Contempt of them  by putting them in Comparison with your own Worth  However  my Philosophy is neither of the Cynic or Misanthrope Kind  I have neither an Aversion to Men or Things  for I can very well indulge myself with both  but then I consider them like a Dream or a Feast  which serve as Amusements for the Time  and leave either no Longing  or a Satiety  behind  Indeed  I take the true Use of Philosophy to be  not to vex ourselves in Prosperity  but to comfort us in Adversity  In short  we need not be so rigidly on our Guard against the Pleasures of this Life  for they seldom happen  or continue long enough to soften or emasculate our Natures  But Disappointments or Misfortunes are the Things  which are most familiar to us  and yet  by our Uneasiness  seem the Things  which we are least used to  Most of the Mortifications  we complain of  are what we owe to one another  a great many of which may be avoided  if we justly considered Men but as Tools  An Instrument  which has not Sharpness enough for a Razor  may have Strength sufficient for a Paring Shovel  and that  which has not Toughness for an Hammer  may have proper Weight for a Mallet  Now  to instance in Men  — would make a miserable Confidant  but  if you are to Page  205 make an Apology  he can tell an admirable Lye for you  — is not of Stuff to make a Friend  but nobody directs a Coachman to Ranelagh better  —  indeed  cannot write Letters  but sure he can carry them to the Post  — would be but an indifferent Comforter in Affliction  but then he can make you laugh  and forget it  So that a tolerable Judgment  upon the different Characters of Mankind  may help us to work some useful End  even out of the Worst and Meanest  And  as to the Evils and Goods of Life  a religious Sense of them will be found to be the only true philosophic one — to consider the first as a Reprobation of our Faults  and so amend  and the latter as a Reward of our Virtues  and so persevere   I took a solitary Walk in my Fields this Evening  contemplating upon such Subjects as these  and think  I never observed a more beautiful Western Sky  at the Setting of the Sun  This shall be the Test with me  whether there be a true poetical Genius in this Island  at present  for such a one must certainly  like Prometheus  catch Fire at the Sun in so much Glory  For no Person can be eminent in this Art  who has not a strong Enthusiasm about
