his pride was mortified  at his own want of importance  which he did not fail to ascribe to their  defect in point of judgment and taste  He conceived a disgust at the  mercenary conduct  as well as the shallow intellects  of the ladies  and  after he had spent some months  and a round sum of money  in fruitless  attendance and addresses  he fairly quitted the pursuit  and consoled  himself with the conversation of a merry fille de joie  whose good  graces he acquired by an allowance of twenty louis per month  That he  might the more easily afford this expense  he dismissed his chariot and  French lacquey at the same time   He then entered himself in a noted academy  in order to finish his  exercises  and contracted an acquaintance with a few sensible people   whom he distinguished at the coffee house and ordinary to which he  resorted  and who contributed not a little to the improvement of his  knowledge and taste  for  prejudice apart  it must be owned that France  abounds with men of consummate honour  profound sagacity  and the most  liberal education  From the conversation of such  he obtained a distinct  idea of their government and constitution  and though he could not help  admiring the excellent order and economy of their police  the result of  all his inquiries was self congratulation on his title to the privileges  of a British subject  Indeed this invaluable birthright was rendered  conspicuous by such flagrant occurrences  which fell every day almost  under his observation  that nothing but the grossest prejudice could  dispute its existence   CHAPTER XL      6 22 15  3 45 PM   Acquires a distinct Idea of the French Government  Quarrels with a  Mousquetaire  whom he afterwards fights and vanquishes  after having  punished him for interfering in his amorous Recreations   Among many other instances of the same nature  I believe it will not be  amiss to exhibit a few specimens of their administration  which happened  during his abode at Paris  that those who have not the opportunity  of observing for themselves  or are in danger of being influenced by  misrepresentation  may compare their own condition with that of their  neighbours  and do justice to the constitution under which they live   A lady of distinguished character having been lampooned by some obscure  scribbler  who could not be discovered  the ministry  in consequence  of her complaint  ordered no fewer than five and twenty abbes to be  apprehended and sent to the Bastille  on the maxim of Herod  when he  commanded the innocents to be murdered  hoping that the principal object  of his cruelty would not escape in the general calamity  and the  friends of those unhappy prisoners durst not even complain of the unjust  persecution  but shrugged up their shoulders  and in silence deplored  their misfortune  uncertain whether or not they should ever set eyes on  them again   About the same time a gentleman of family  who had been oppressed by a  certain powerful duke that lived in the neighbourhood  found means to  be introduced to the king  who  receiving his petition very graciously   asked in what regiment he served  and when the memorialist answered  that he had not the honour of being in the service  returned the paper  unopened  and refused to hear one circumstance of his complaint  so  that  far from being redressed  he remained more than ever exposed to  the tyranny of his oppressors  nay  so notorious is the discouragement  of all those who presume to live independent of court favour and  connections that one of the gentlemen  whose friendship Peregrine  cultivated  frankly owned he was in possession of a most romantic place  in one of the provinces  and deeply enamoured of a country life  and  yet he durst not reside upon his own estate  lest  by slackening in his  attendance upon the great  who honoured him with their protection  he  should fall a prey to some rapacious intendant   As for the common people  they are so much inured to the scourge and  insolence of power  that every shabby subaltern  every beggarly cadet of  the noblesse  every low retainer to the court  insults and injures them  with impunity  A certain ecuyer  or horsedealer  belonging to the king   being one day under the hands of a barber  who happened to cut the head  of a pimple on his face  he started up  and drawing his sword  wounded  him desperately in the shoulder  The poor tradesman  hurt as he was   made an effort to retire  and was followed by this barbarous assassin   who  not contented with the vengeance he had taken  plunged his sword a  second time into his body  and killed him on the spot  Having performed  this inhuman exploit  he dressed himself with great deliberation  and  going to Versailles  immediately obtained a pardon for what he had done   triumphing in his brutality with such insolence  that the very next time  he had occasion to be shaved he sat with his sword
