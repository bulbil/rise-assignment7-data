of ALMEIDA before   the end of the next hour  was as certain as that the next hour would   arrive  suddenly entered the apartment  but upon discovering HAMET  he   started back astonished and disappointed  HAMET stood unmoved  and   regarded him with a fixed and steady look  that at once reproached and   confounded him   What treachery   said ALMORAN   has been practised   against me  What has brought thee to this place  and how hast thou   gained admittance    Against thy peace   said HAMET   no treachery has   been practised  but by thyself  By those arts in which thy vices have   employed the powers of darkness  I have been brought hither  and by   those arts I have gained admittance  thy form which they have imposed   upon me  was my passport  and by the restoration of my own  I have   detected and disappointed the fraud  which the double change was   produced to execute  ALMEIDA  whom  as HAMET  thou couldst teach to   hate thee  it is now impossible that  as ALMORAN  thou shouldst teach to   love        ALMEIDA  who perceived the storm to be gathering which the next moment   would burst upon the head of HAMET  interposed between them  and   addressed each of them by turns  urging HAMET to be silent  and   conjuring ALMORAN to be merciful  ALMORAN  however  without regarding   ALMEIDA  or making any reply to HAMET  struck the ground with his foot    and the messengers of death  to whom the signal was familiar  appeared   at the door  ALMORAN then commanded them to seize his brother  with a   countenance pale and livid  and a voice that was broken by rage  HAMET   was still unmoved  but ALMEIDA threw herself at the feet of ALMORAN  and   embracing his knees was about to speak  but he broke from her with   sudden fury   If the world should sue   said he   I would spurn it off    There is no pang that cunning can invent  which he shall not suffer  and   when death at length shall disappoint my vengeance  his mangled limbs   shall be cast out unburied  to feed the beasts of the desert and the   fowls of heaven   During this menace  ALMEIDA sunk down without signs of   life  and HAMET struggling in vain for liberty to raise her from the   ground  she was carried off by some women who were called to her   assistance       In this awful crisis  HAMET  who felt his own fortitude give way  looked   up  and though he conceived no words  a prayer ascended from his heart   to heaven  and was accepted by Him  to whom our thoughts are known while   they are yet afar off  For HAMET  the fountain of strength was opened   from above  his eye sparkled with confidence  and his breast was dilated   by hope  He commanded the guard that were leading him away to stop  and   they implicitly obeyed  he then stretched out his hand towards ALMORAN    whose spirit was rebuked before him   Hear me   said he   thou tyrant    for it is thy genius that speaks by my voice  What has been the fruit of   all thy guilt  but accumulated misery  What joy hast thou derived from   undivided empire  what joy from the prohibition of my marriage with   ALMEIDA  what good from that power  which some evil daemon has added to   thy own  what  at this moment  is thy portion  but rage and anguish    disappointment  and despair  Even I  whom thou seest the captive of thy   power  whom thou hast wronged of empire  and yet more of love  even I am   happy  in comparison of thee  I know that my sufferings  however   multiplied  are short  for they shall end with life  and no life is   long  then shall the everlasting ages commence  and through everlasting   ages thy sufferings shall increase  The moment is now near  when thou   shalt tread that line which alone is the path to heaven  the narrow   path that is stretched over the pit  which smokes for ever  and for   ever  When thine aking eye shall look forward to the end that is far   distant  and when behind thou shalt find no retreat  when thy steps   shall faulter  and thou shalt tremble at the depth beneath  which   thought itself is not able to fathom  then shall the angel of   distribution lift his inexorable hand against thee  from the irremeable   way shall thy feet be smitten  thou shalt plunge in the burning flood    and though thou shalt live for ever  thou shalt rise no more
