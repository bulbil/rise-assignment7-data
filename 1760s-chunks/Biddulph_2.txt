things for punishments  than the others are for rewards  and by thus estimating    both  to look forward for an equal distribution of justice  to that place only  where  let our station be what it will  our lot is to be unchangeable  It is in this light that I was instructed in my early days to consider the various portions that fall to the share of mankind  which very often  as far as we can see  appear extremely partial  and no doubt would really be so  were there not an invisible world where the distributions are just and equal  From this reflection I have drawn comfort in many trying incidents of my life  but in none more than the unhappy fate of a lady  who was my particular friend  and who  tho’ a woman of most exemplary virtue  was  thro’ the course of her whole life  persecuted by a variety of strange misfortunes  This lady  to use your expression  madam  addressing her friend   to all human appearance  ought at last to have been rewarded even here—but her portion was affliction  What then are we to conclude  but  that God does not estimate things as we do  It is ignorant  as well as sinful  to arraign his providence  We daily see its dispensations with our own eyes  in the various accidents of life  Why should we not then allow the poet to copy from life  and exhibit to our view events  the probability of which are founded on general experience   We are indeed so much used to what they call poetical justice  that we are disappointed in the catastrophe of a fable  if every body concerned in it be not disposed of according to the sentence of that judge which we have set up in our own breasts   The contrary we know happens in real life  let us not then condemn what is drawn from real life —We may wish to see nature copied from her more pleasing works  but a martyr expiring in tortures  is as just  though not as agreeable  a representation of her  as a hero rewarded with the brightest honours   We agreed with the venerable lady in her observations  and her son taking occasion from her mentioning that unfortunate person  who was her friend  told her  he would take it as a particular favour  if she would oblige me with the sight of that lady’s story   She answered  that as we had fixed up the next day for our departure  there would not be time for me to peruse it  but that she would entrust me with it to take it to town  that I might read it at my leisure  It is drawn up  said she  for the most part  by the lady herself  and the occasion of its being so was this  She and I had been intimate from our childhood  we were play fellows when young  and constant companions as we grew up  We always called each other sister  and loved as well as if we had really borne that relationship to each other     It was our continual practice from children to keep little journals of what daily happened to us  these  in all our short absences  were matter of great entertainment to us  we constantly communicated them when we met  or if we chanced to be separated by any distance  we made a mutual exchange by the post of our little diurnal registers  having made each a solemn promise  not to conceal an incident  or even a thought  of the least moment  from the other  and this promise I believe was religiously kept up during a correspondence of many years   I had a brother about three years older than myself  a very promising young man  He was an only son  and the darling of his parents  when he had finished his studies  my father thought of sending him abroad  but his fondness for him made him resolve to accompany him himself   A better tutor or a better guide he could not have found for him  my father was then in the prime of life  he had no other children but him and me  My mother  as fond of me as he was of his son  and perfectly affectionate to my father  expressed her wish to let both her and me be of his party  She said  she thought a young lady  under proper conduct  might improve as much by seeing foreign courts  and the various customs of different nations  as a young gentleman   I was then about sixteen  my father readily consented  as he perfectly loved my mother  and we all four set out on our tour together  It was my lot  after I had been some time abroad  to marry an English gentleman  then resident at Vienna  this occasioned my continuing there some years  and it was during that space of time that I had the occurrences of my friend’s life from her own hand  As she had kept up to the method we had agreed on of communicating every thing that happened  even to trivial matters  it generally encreased the bulk of the packets I used to receive from her to a prodigious size  these she sent off occasionally  at nearer
