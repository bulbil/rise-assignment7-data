privy to the machination of the needle    now approached  and interposed in behalf of his unhappy servant    He petitioned  he kneeled  he wept   but his prayers and tears were   cast to the winds and the rocks  till Vindex had reduced poor Ned   to a plight little different from that of St  Bartholomew      Mr  Vindex justly deemed that he had now given a lesson of such   ample instruction  as might dispense with his presence for some   days at least      In the mean time  Ned s flogging held him confined to his bed    where he had full time and leisure to contrive with one end  a just   and worthy retribution for the sufferings of the other      Harry went often to sit and condole with Ned  in this the season   of his calamity   and as he had now conceived a strong aversion to   the pedagogue  on account of his barbarity  he offered to assist his   friend in any measures deemed adequate to the stripes and injuries   he had received      The house of Mr  Vindex was a large and old fashioned building    with a steep flight of stone stairs  and a spacious landing place   before the door  Ned was again on his legs  the night was ex    cessive dark  and the family of the preceptor had just finished an   early supper      About this time a gentle rapping was heard  and a servant open    ing the door  looked this way and that way  and called out re    peatedly to know who was there   but no voice replying  he retired   and shut all to again  Scarce was he re entered  when he hears         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  61     rap  rap  rap  rap  The fellow s anger was now kindled  and   opening the door suddenly  he bounced out at once  in order to   seize the runaway   but seeing no creature  he began to feel a   coming chillness  and his hairs to stir  as though each had got the   life of an eel  Back he slunk  closed the door with the greatest   tenderness  and crept down to reveal a scantling of his fears to his   fellows in the kitchen      Now  though men and maids laughed heartily at the appre    hensions of Hodge  they resented this insult on their house  as they   called it   and getting all up together in a group  they slily crowded   behind the door  with the latch in one of their hands  ready to issue    in an instant  and detect the delinquents      They were not suffered to freeze  Knock  knock  knock  knock    knock  Open flies the door  and out rush the servants  Nothing   appeared  They all stood silent  and astonished beyond measure    Some  however  with outward bravade  but inward tremblings    went searching along the walls and behind the posts for some   lurcher  Again they gathered to the landing place  and stood   whisperingly debating what this might be   when  to the inex    pressible terror and discomfiture of all present  the spontaneous   knocker assumed sudden life and motion  and gave such a peal and   alarm to their eyes and ears  as put every sense and resolution to   the rout   and in they rushed again  one on the back of the other    and clapped to the door  as in the face of an host of pursuing   demons      Mr  Vindex and his lady  for some time past  had been sitting   opposite  and nodding over a fire in the back parlour  where they   returned each other s salute with the greatest good manners and   punctuality imaginable  He now started on hearing the rustling   in the hall  and angrily called to know what was the matter      Vindex  from the prejudice of education during his infancy  had   conceived the utmost spite to all spectres and hobgoblins  insomuch   that he wished to deprive them of their very existence  and la    boured to persuade himself  as well as others  of their nonentity     but faith proved too strong within him  for all his verbal parade   of avowed infidelity      While the servants  with pale faces and short breath  made their   relation  the magisterial philosopher did so sneer  and contempt    uously toss this way and the other  and throw himself back in such   affected fits of laughter  as nothing could be like it  till  bouncing   at the sound of another peal  he mustered the whole family
