was the consequence   The King had not now  for two years  visited his German dominions  and therefore soon after the breaking up of parliament he prepared for a journey to Hanover  Accordingly  having appointed an administration in his absence  he embarked for Holland  lay  upon his landing  at the little town of Vert  next day proceeded on his journey  and  in two days more  between ten and eleven at night  arrived at Delden  in all appearance in perfect health  He supped there very heartily  and eat an orange  and continued his progress early the next morning  Between eight and nine he ordered the coach to stop  and  it being perceived that one of his hands lay motionless  monsieur Fabrice  who had formerly been the servant of the King of Sweden  and now attended King George  chafed it between his  As this had no effect  the surgeon was called  who followed on horseback  and also rubbed it with spirits  soon after the King s tongue began to swell  and he had just force enough to bid them hasten to Osnaburgh  and  falling into Fabrice s arms  quite insensible  never recovered  but expired about eleven o clock the next morning  He died on Sunday the eleventh of June  in the sixty eighth year of his age  and in the thirteenth of his reign  Whatever was good or great in the reign of George I  ought to be attributed wholly to himself  and whenever he deviated  it might justly be imputed to a ministry always partial  and often corrupt  He was almost ever …nded with good fortune  which was partly owing   137 to prudence  and more to assiduity  In short  his successes are the strongest instance of how much may be atchieved by moderate abilities  exerted with application and uniformity   I am   c   LETTER XVI   I Have not hitherto said any thing of the literature of the present period  having resolved to refer it to a separate letter  in which we may have a more perspicuous view of it  than if blended with the ordinary occurrences of the state  Though learning had never received fewer encouragements than in the present reign  yet it never flourished more  That spirit of philosophy which had been excited in former ages  still continued to operate with the greatest success  and produced the greatest men in every profession  Among the divines  Atterbury and Clarke distinguished themselves  As a preacher  Atterbury united all the graces of style with all the elegance of a just delivery  he was natural  polite  spirited  and his sermons may be ranked among the first of this period  Clarke  on the other hand  despising the graces of eloquence  only sought after conviction  with rigorous though phlegmatic exactness  and brought moral truths almost to mathematical precision  Yet neither he  Cudworth  nor any other divine  did such service to the reasoning world  as the great Mr  John Locke  who may be justly said to have reformed all our modes of thinking in metaphysical inquiry  Though the jargon of schools had been before him arraigned  yet several of their errors had still subsisted  and were regarded as true  Locke therefore set imself to overturn their systems  and refute their bsurdities  these he effectually accomplished  for hich reason his book  which  when published  was   138 of infinite service  it may be found less useful at present  when the doctrines it was calculated to refute  are no longer subsisting   Among the moral writers of this period  the Earl of Shaftesbury is not to be passed over  whose elegance  in some measure  recompenses for his want of solidity  The opinions of all latter writers upon moral subjects  are only derived from the ancients Morals are a subject on which the industry of men has been exercised in every age  and an infinite number of systems have been the result  That of Shaftesbury  in which he establishes a natural sense of mo¦ral beauty  was originally professed by Plato  and only adorned by the English philosopher  Thi seemed to be the age of speculation  Berkeley  af¦terwards Bishop of Cloyne in Ireland  surpassed al his cotemporaries in subtlety of disquisition  but th mere efforts of reason  which are exerted rather t raise doubt than procure certainty  will never mee with much favour from so vain a being as man Lord Bolingbroke had also some reputation for me¦taphysical inquiry  his friends extolled his sagacity on that head  and the public were willing enough t acquiesce in their opinion  his fame therefore migh have continued to rise  or  at least  would have ne¦ver sunk  if he had never published  His work have appeared  and the public are no longer in thei former sentiments  In mathematics and natural phi¦losophy  the vein opened by Newton  was prosecute with success  Doctor Halley illustrated the theory 〈◊〉 the tides  and increased the catalogue of the stars while Gregory reduced astronomy to one compre¦hensive and regular system  Doctor Friend  in me¦dicine  produced some ingenious theories  which  … they did not improve the art  at least shewed his abi¦lities and learning in his profession  Doctor Mea was equally elegant  and more successful  to him …
