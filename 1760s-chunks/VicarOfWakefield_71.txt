is yours  if you can stoop to an alliance with a family so poor as mine  take her  obtain her consent  as I know you have her heart  and you have mine  And let me tell you  Sir  that I give you no small treasure  she has been celebrated for beauty it is true  but that is not my meaning  I give you up a treasure in her mind     But I suppose  Sir    cried Mr  Burchell    that you are apprized of my circumstances  and of my incapacity to support her as she deserves     If your present objection    replied I    be meant as an evasion of my offer  I desist  but I know no man so worthy to deserve her as you  and if I could give  Page  170  her thousands  and thousands sought her from me  yet my honest brave Burchell should be my dearest choice    To all this his silence alone seemed to give a mortifying refusal  and without the least reply to my offer  he demanded if we could not be furnished with refreshments from the next inn  to which being answered in the affirmative  he ordered them to send in the best dinner that could be provided upon such short notice  He bespoke also a dozen of their best wine  and some cordials for me  Adding  with a smile  that he would stretch a little for once  and tho  in a prison  asserted he was never better disposed to be merry  The waiter soon made his appearance with preparations for dinner  a table was lent us by the gaoler  who seemed remarkably assiduous  the wine was disposed in order  and two very welldrest dishes were brought in     Page  171  My daughter had not yet heard of her poor brother s melancholy situation  and we all seemed unwilling to damp her chearfulness by the relation  But it was in vain that I attempted to appear chearful  the circumstances of my unfortunate son broke through all efforts to dissemble  so that I I was at last obliged to damp our mirth by relating his misfortunes  and wishing that he might be permitted to share with us in this little interval of satisfaction  After my guests were recovered from the consternation my account had produced  I requested also that Mr  Jenkinson  a fellow prisoner  might be admitted  and the gaoler granted my request with an air of unusual submission  The clanking of my son s irons was no sooner heard along the passage  than his sister ran impatiently to meet him  while Mr  Burchell  in the mean time  asked me if my son s name were George  to which replying in the affirmative  he still continued silent  As soon as my boy entered the  Page  172  room  I could perceive he regarded Mr  Burchell with a look of astonishment and reverence      Come on    cried I    my son  though we are fallen very low  yet providence has been pleased to grant us some small relaxation from pain  Thy sister is restored to us  and there is her deliverer  to that brave man it is that I am indebted for yet having a daughter  give him  my boy  the hand of friendship  he deserves our warmest gratitude    My son seemed all this while regardless of what I said  and still continued fixed at respectful distance —     My dear brother    cried his sister    why don t you thank my good deliverer  the brave should ever love each other    He still continued his silence and astonishment  till our guest at last perceived himself to be known  and assuming all his  Page  173  native dignity  desired my son to come forward  Never before had I seen any thing so truly majestic as the air he assumed upon this occasion  The greatest object in the universe  says a certain philosopher  is a good man struggling with adversity  yet there is still a greater  which is the good man that comes to relieve it  After he had regarded my son for some time with a superior air      I again find    said he    unthinking boy  that the same crime   But here he was interrupted by one of the gaoler s servants  who came to inform us that a person of distinction  who had driven into town with a chariot and several attendants  sent his respects to the gentleman that was with us  and begged to know when he should think proper to be waited upon —   Bid the fellow wait    cried our guest    till I shall have leisure to receive him    and then turning to my son    I again find  Sir    proceeded he    that you are guilty of the same offence  Page  174  for which you once had my reproof  and for which the law is now preparing its justest punishments  You imagine  perhaps  that a contempt for your own life  gives you a right to take
