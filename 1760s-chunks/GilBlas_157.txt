so pompous an air were the very sharpers with whom I had been affiliated at Toledo  Why  thou degenerate vicar choral  exclaimed I  these fine blades of whom thou hast been boasting are among the number of my acquaintance also  for I too have lived with them in the New Street  we were hand in glove  took our meals at the same mess  and  in short  were scarcely ever asunder  You are a wag  replied he  with a knowing wink  that is to say  you got into the gang three years ago  when I left it  My motive for quitting such a worshipful fraternity  resumed I  was an itch for travelling  I mean to make the tour of Spain  A little more knowledge of the world will make me quite another thing  Doubtless  said he  there is no possible way but travelling to rub off the rust  or bring wit  talent  and address to perfection  It is for the self same reason that I too turned my back upon Toledo  though the time glided away there very agreeably  But thanks to a kind providence  which has yoked me with a labourer in my own vineyard  when I least expected it  Let us join our forces  let us travel the same road  let us make a joint stock out of our neighbours  purses  let us rob  let us cheat  let us avail ourselves of every opportunity that may offer of exemplifying our theory  and improving our practice  in the noble art on which our skill is employed   The proposal was made in so candid a spirit  so like a citizen of the world  untainted with the selfishness of your honest men  that I closed in with it at once  My confidence was surrendered at the first summons to the frankness with which he volunteered his own  We spoke our free hearts each to the other  I dilated all my pilgrimage  and he spake of most disastrous chances  of moving accidents through which he had passed even from his boyish days to this very moment of his ripe and rampant roguery  It appeared that he was on his way from Portalegre  whence he had been obliged to decamp with the utmost expedition on account of a little swindling transaction in which his luck happened not to keep pace with his ingenuity  The habit he wore was sacrilegiously adopted as a cloak to his person and real character  since he thought it safest to be near the church  however far from God  Thus did we two share all our counsel  and pledge our brother s vows  till we grew together like a double cherry  and determined  with two seeming bodies but one heart  to incorporate our voices and minds in some master stroke at Merida  If it took  well and good  if not  we had only to cut and run  From this moment  community of goods  that pure and simple feature of patriarchal life  was enacted as a law between us  Moralez  it is true  for that was my fellow traveller s name  did not find himself in the most splendid condition possible  His funds were limited to five or six ducats  with a few little articles in a bag  I therefore was the monied man of the firm  but then there was brass in his forehead for an inexhaustible coinage  and the seeming of a saint when he played the devil most  So on we journeyed on the ride and tie principle  and arrived in humble cavalcade at Merida   We put up at an inn near the skirts of the town  where my comrade changed his dress  When he had rigged himself in layman s attire  we took a turn up and down  to reconnoitre the ground  and see if we could pick out some opportunity of labouring in our vocation  Had it been our good fortune to have lived before Homer  that old apologist for sharping by wholesale would have dignified our excursion with a simile   Not half so keen  fierce vultures of the chase Stoop from the mountains on the feathered race   To descend into plain prose  we were ruminating on the chapter of accidents  and hammering out some theme for the employment of our industry  when we espied a grey headed old gentleman in the street  sword in hand  defending himself against three men who were thrusting at him with all their might and main  The unfairness of the match was what stuck in my throat  so that flying  with the spirit of a prize fighter  to see fair play  I made common cause with the old man  Moralez followed up my blows  We proved ourselves match for the three assailants  and put them completely to the rout   Our rescued friend was profuse in his acknowledgments  We are in rapture  said I  at our good luck in being here so seasonably for your assistance  but let us at least know to whom we have been so fortunate as to be serviceable  and what inducement those three men could possibly have for their murderous attempt  Gentlemen replied he  my obligations are too great to hesitate about satisfying your curiosity  my name is Jerome de Moyadas  a gentleman of this town  living on my means  One of these cut
