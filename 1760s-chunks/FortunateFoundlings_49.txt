every way his inferior  preferred to him  His   thoughts were wholly bent on revenge  but in what manner he should   accomplish it  he was for some time uncertain  when he acquainted his   father with the discovery he had made  and the resentment he had   testified against this unworthy rival  as he called him  the old   gentleman blamed him for taking any notice of it  Let them love on  son    said he  let them marry   we shall then have a fine opportunity of   reproaching the haughty baron with his new alliance  This did not   however satisfy monsieur de Coigney  all the love he once had for   mademoiselle Charlotta was now turned into hate  and in spite of his   father s commands not to meddle in the affair  he could not help   throwing out some reflections among his companions  very much to the   disadvantage of the young lady s reputation  But these might possibly   have blown over  as he had but a small time to vent his malice  His   father knowing the violence of his temper  in order to prevent any ill   consequences  compelled him to return to his employment  taking upon   himself the management of that business which had brought him so   unluckily to Paris       But mademoiselle de Coigney had no sooner been informed by her brother   of the discovery he had made  than she doubted not that it was on the   score of Horatio that he had met with such ill success in his courtship    and also imagined  that it had been owing to some ill impressions   mademoiselle Charlotta had given the baron de Palfoy  that her father   had been treated by him in the manner already recited  She complained of   it to the baron de la Valiere  and told him  her whole family had been   affronted  and her brother rendered miserable  for the sake of a young   man  who  said she  can neither have birth or fortune to boast of  since   he has been so long a prisoner without any ransom paid  or interposition   offered to redeem him       The baron was too generous not to vindicate the merits of Horatio  as   much as was consistent with his love and complaisance for his mistress    he was notwithstanding very much picqued in his mind that a person  to   whom he had given the greatest proofs of a sincere and disinterested   friendship  should have concealed a secret of this nature from him  and   the more so  as he had seemed to expect and desire his confidence  From   this time forward he behaved to him with a coldness which was sufficient   to convince the other of the motive  especially as he found mademoiselle   de Coigney took all opportunities of throwing the most picquant   reflections on him  It is certain that lady was so full of spight at the   indignity she thought her family had received  that she could not help   whispering the attachment of Horatio and Charlotta  not only at St    Germains  but at Paris also  with inunendo s little less cruel than   those her brother had made use of to his companions  so that between   them  the amour was talked of among all who were acquainted with   either of them       At length the report reached the ears of the baron de Palfoy  who  tho    he did not immediately give an entire credit to it  thought it became   him to do every thing in his power to silence it       Accordingly he called his daughter to him one day  and having told her   the liberty which the world took in censuring her conduct on Horatio s   account  commanded her to avoid all occasions of it for the future  by   seeing him no more       The confusion she was in  and which she had not artifice wholly to   conceal from the penetrating baron  more convinced him  than all he had   been told  that there was in reality some tender intercourse between   them  but resolving to be fully ascertained  he said no more to her at   that time  but dispatched a messenger immediately to St  Germains    desiring Horatio to come to him the same day       The lover readily obeyed this summons  but not without some   apprehensions of the motive  the hints daily given him  joined to the   alteration  not only in the behaviour of mademoiselle de Coigney  but   likewise of the baron de la Valiere  gave him but too just room to fear   his passion was no longer a secret       The father of Charlotta received him with great courtesy  but nothing of   that pleasantness with which he had looked on him ever since he had   defended him from the robbers
