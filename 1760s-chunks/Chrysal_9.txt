to be the better   part of valour  There was Captain Lord Harry Powlett  for   instance  afterward sixth Duke of Bolton  who being sent   in chase of a sail  got his carpenter to report the stern post   loose  and the ship unfit for action  The nickname    Captain   Sternpost   clung to this patrician warrior for life  The case   of Lord George Sackville  who failed to charge at the battle   of Minden  and so saved the enemy from total destruction    is more famous  Chrysal gives the harshest interpretation   of his conduct   yet  after all  is not more severe on this mis    guided nobleman than was the minister of war  William Pitt    who protested strongly against Sackville s return to court   under the Bute administration  Other defaulters  some of   whom it is but just to say were acquitted on their court    martial  have their cases  so to speak  re tried by Johnstone   at the bar of public opinion  and come off pretty badly  Most   of them are now of Httle interest except to special students    but it would be rash to suppose that their chastisement by   our satirist afforded his readers less satisfaction than that   of the more celebrated          INTRODUCTION xvu     The prevailing gloom is Ughtened by two or three idealiza    tions of goodness  such as the model commander of a king s   ship  who represents rather what Johnstone thinks such an   ofiB cer ought to he than any one of whom there is historical   record   and by several really human portraits  One of the   most attractive is that of the author s friend and fellow satirist    Charles Churchill   and another very engaging one is of a   typical EngUsh tar  The latter is employed by an unfor    tunate Oriental to rescue him and his daughter from the   clutches of the Inquisition  Having become a Christian  after   the manner of some miraculously converted paynim in old   romance  this man had sought asylum in a Christian country    but on landing had been instantly arrested by the Holy Office   for   errors of opinion    Being rich  he entrusted the sailor   with a large sum  to charter a vessel and carry him to England    Instead of pocketing the money  as many of his superiors    to judge by their habitual conduct  would forthwith have   done with it  leaving the owner to his fate  the bluff mariner   carries out his important commission with an honesty that   is of a piece with his general character  He kicks against the   need for strict obedience once only  when he is ordered not   to attack a French man of war  twice his size      The day after this afiair  when they had all recovered their good   himiour  my master  the Bailor  addressed his owner thus     Now    owner  while the sky is clear  and we have nothing else to do  I had   better give you an account of your money  Here is the log book    which you may overhaul at your leisure  though the sooner the   better  This is the time  there is no taking a good observation in   a storm  as may happen by and by   you will find all as fair aa   a new cable   but I must give you one point to direct your reckoning   by  and that is this  you bade me buy a ship and freight her  and   so forth  and she and the cargo should be my own  after I had done   your job this trip  Now  owner  it is very true that a less vessel   than this might have made the run  but then you seemed so desirous   to be safe  that I thought it best to take a bargain in this stout ship    which I kaew to be as good a sea boat as ever turned to windward    and able to go  hank for hank  with anything that swims the sea  as   we showed when we ran the Frenchman out of sight yesterday    though it went against my heart to do it  But no matter for that   now   the ship is yours  and you have a right to be obeyed  How    ever  there is the account  and here is the rest of your money  of   which I did not lay out a shilling that I could avoid  but one guinea   which I gave Will Cresstree  to repair his rigging  and one I gave   Black Moll of Wapping   and I could not well avoid those neither    for Will was an old messmate  and I owed Moll for many a good
