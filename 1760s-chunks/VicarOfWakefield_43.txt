his enemies  and unfortunately  as I had neither  I suffered the cruellest mortification   neglect    As I was meditating one day in a coffee house on the fate of my paradoxes  a little man happening to enter the room  placed himself in the box before me  and after some preliminary discourse  finding me to be a scholar  drew out a bundle of proposals  begging me to subscribe to a new edition he was going to give the world of Propertius  with notes  This demand necessarily produced a reply that that I had no money  and that concession led him on to enquire into the nature of my expectations  Finding that my expectations were just as great as my purse  I see  cried he  you are unacquainted  Page  8  with the town  I ll teach you a part of it  Look at these proposals  upon these very proposals I have subsisted very comfortably for twelve years  The moment a nobleman returns from his travels  a Creolian arrives from Jamaica  or a dowager from her country seat  I strike for a subscription  I first besiege their hearts with flattery  and then pour in my proposals at the breach  If they subscribe readily the first time  I renew my request to beg a dedication fee  If they let me have that  I smite them once more for engraving their coat of arms at the top  Thus  continued he  I live by vanity  and laugh at it  But between ourselves  I am now too well known  I should be glad to borrow your face a a bit  a nobleman of distinction has just returned from Italy  my face is familiar to his porter  but if you bring this copy of verses  my life for it you succeed  and we divide the spoil      Page  9     Bless us  George    cried I    and is that the employment of poets now  Do men of their exalted talents thus stoop to beggary  Can they so far disgrace their calling  as to make a vile traffic of praise for bread     O no  Sir    returned he    a true poet can never be so base  for wherever there is genius there is pride  The creatures I now describe are only beggars in rhyme  The real poet  as he braves every hardship for fame  so he is equally a coward to contempt  and none but those who are unworthy protection condescend to solicit it    Having a mind too proud to stoop to such indignities  and yet a fortune too humble to hazard a second attempt for fame  I was now obliged to take a middle course  and write for bread  But I was unqualified for a profession where mere industry alone could ensure success   Page  10  I could not suppress my lurking passion for applause  but usually consumed that time in efforts after excellence which takes up but little room  when it should have been more advantageously employed in the diffusive productions of fruitful mediocrity  My little piece would come forth in the mist of periodical publication  unnoticed and unknown  The public were more importantly employed  than to observe the easy simplicity of my style  or the harmony of my periods  Sheet after sheet was thrown off to oblivion  My essays were buried among the essays upon liberty  eastern tales  and cures for the bite of a mad dog  while Philantos  Philalethes  Philelutheros  and Philanthropos  all wrote better  because they wrote faster  than I      Now  therefore  I began to associate with none but disappointed authors  like myself  who praised  deplored  and despised each other  The satisfaction we  Page  11  found in every celebrated writer s attempts  was inversely as their merits  I found that no genius in another could please me  My unfortunate paradoxes had entirely dried up that source of comfort  I could neither read nor write with satisfaction  for excellence in another was my aversion  and writing was my trade      In the midst of these gloomy reflections  as I was one day sitting on a bench in St  James s park  a young gentleman of distinction  who had been my intimate acquaintance at the university  approached me  We saluted each other with some hesitation  he almost ashamed of being known to one who made so shabby an appearance  and I afraid of a repulse  But my suspicions soon vanished  for Ned Thornhill was at the bottom a very good natured fellow      Page  12     What did you say  George    interrupted I    Thornhill  was not that his name  It can certainly be no other than my landlord    â€”   Bless me    cried Mrs  Arnold    is Mr  Thornhill so near a neighbour of yours  He has long been a friend in our family  and we expect a visit from him shortly     My friend s first care    continued my son    was to alter my appearance by a very fine suit of his
