to the direction  he had received  went to the house of Mrs  Gauntlet in a transport of  joyous expectation  As he approached the gate  his agitation increased   he knocked with impatience and concern  the door opened  and he had  actually asked if Mrs  Gauntlet was at home  before he perceived that  the portress was no other than his dear Emilia  She was not without  emotion at the unexpected sight of her lover  who instantly recognising  his charmer obeyed the irresistible impulse of his love  and caught the  fair creature in his arms  Nor did she seem offended at this forwardness  of behaviour  which might have displeased another of a less open  disposition  or less used to the freedom of a sensible education  but  her natural frankness had been encouraged and improved by the easy and  familiar intercourse in which she had been bred  and therefore  instead  of reprimanding him with a severity of look  she with great good humour  rallied him upon his assurance  which  she observed  was undoubtedly  the effect of his own conscious merit  and conducted him into a parlour   where he found her mother  who  in very polite terms  expressed her  satisfaction at seeing him within her house   After tea  Miss Emy proposed an evening walk  which they enjoyed through  a variety of little copses and lawns  watered by a most romantic stream   that quite enchanted the imagination of Peregrine   It was late before they returned from this agreeable excursion  and when  our lover wished the ladies good night  Mrs  Gauntlet insisted upon his  staying to supper  and treated him with particular demonstrations  of regard and affection  As her economy was not encumbered with an  unnecessary number of domestics  her own presence was often required in  different parts of the house  so that the young gentleman was supplied  with frequent opportunities of promoting his suit by all the tender  oaths and insinuations that his passion could suggest  He protested her  idea had taken such entire possession of his heart  that finding  himself unable to support her absence one day longer  he had quitted  his studies  and left his governor by stealth  that he might visit the  object of his adoration  and be blessed in her company for a few days  without interruption   She listened to his addresses with such affability as denoted  approbation and delight  and gently chided him as a thoughtless truant   but carefully avoided the confession of a mutual flame  because she  discerned  in the midst of all his tenderness  a levity of pride which  she durst not venture to trust with such a declaration  Perhaps she  was confirmed in this caution by her mother  who very wisely  in her  civilities to him  maintained a sort of ceremonious distance  which she  thought not only requisite for the honour and interest of her family   but likewise for her own exculpation  should she ever be taxed with  having encouraged or abetted him in the imprudent sallies of his youth   yet  notwithstanding this affected reserve  he was treated with such  distinction by both  that he was ravished with his situation  and became    6 22 15  3 45 PM   more and more enamoured every day   While he remained under the influence of this sweet intoxication   his absence produced great disturbance at Winchester  Mr  Jolter was  grievously afflicted at his abrupt departure  which alarmed him the  more  as it happened after a long fit of melancholy which he had  perceived in his pupil  He communicated his apprehensions to the master  of the school  who advised him to apprise the commodore of his nephew s  disappearance  and in the mean time inquire at all the inns in  town  whether he had hired horses  or any sort of carriage  for his  conveyance  or was met with on the road by any person who could give an  account of the direction in which he travelled   The scrutiny  though performed with great diligence and minuteness   was altogether ineffectual  they could obtain no intelligence of the  runaway  Mr  Trunnion was well distracted at the news of his flight  he  raved with great fury at the imprudence of Peregrine  whom in his first  transports he d  d as an ungrateful deserter  then he cursed Hatchway  and Pipes  who he swore had foundered the lad by their pernicious  counsels  and  lastly  transferred his execrations upon Jolter  because  he had not kept a better look out  finally  he made an apostrophe to  that son of a b   the gout  which for the present disabled him from  searching for his nephew in person  That he might not  however  neglect  any means in his power  he immediately despatched expresses to all the  sea port towns on that coast  that he might be prevented from leaving  the kingdom  and the lieutenant  at his own desire  was sent across the  country  in quest of this young fugitive   Four days had he unsuccessfully carried on his inquiries with great
