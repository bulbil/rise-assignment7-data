 205  LETTER CXIII  To the same   THERE is something irresistibly pleasing in the conversation of a fine woman  even though her tongue be silent  the eloquence of her eyes teaches wisdom  The mind sympathizes with the regularity of the object in view  and struck with external grace  vibrates into respondent harmony  In this agreeable disposition  I lately found myself in company with my friend and his niece  Our conversation turned upon love  which she seemed equally capable of defending and inspiring  We were each of different opinions upon this subject  the lady insisted that it was a natural and universal passion  and produced the happiness of those who cultivated it with proper precaution  My friend denied it to be the work of nature  but allowed it to have a real existence  and affirmed that it was of infinite service in refining society  while I  to keep up the dispute  affirmed it to be merely a name  first used by the cunning part of the fair sex  and admitted by the silly part of ours  therefore no way more natural than taking snuff or chewing opium    How is it possible  cried I  that such a passion can be natural  when our opinions even of beauty  which inspires it  are entirely the result of fashion and caprice  The ancients  who pretended to be connoisseurs in the art  have praised narrow foreheads  red hair  and eyebrows that joined each other over the nose  Such were the charms that   206 once captivated Catullus  Ovid  and Anacreon  Ladies would at present be out of humour  if their lovers praised them for such graces  and should an antique beauty now revive  her face would certainly be put under the discipline of the tweezer  forehead cloth and lead comb  before it could be seen in public company     But the difference between the antients and moderns is not so great  as between the different countries of the present world  A lover of Gongora  for instance  sighs for thick lips  a Chinese lover is poetical in praise of thin  In Circassia a streight nose is thought most consistent with beauty  cross but a mountain which separates it from the Tartars  and there flat noses  tawny skins  and eyes three inches asunder  are all the fashion  In Persia and some other countries  a man when he marries  chuses to have his bride a maid  in the Phillipine Islands  if a bridegroom happens to perceive on the first night that he is put off with a virgin  the marriage is declared void to all intents and purposes  and the bride sent back with disgrace  In some parts of the East  a woman of beauty  properly fed up for sale  often amounts to one hundred crowns  in the kingdom of Loango  Ladies of the very best fashion are sold for a pig  Queens however sell better  and sometimes amount to a cow  In short  turn even to England  don t I there see the beautiful part of the sex neglected  and none now marrying or making love but old men and old women that have saved money  Don t I see beauty from fifteen to twenty one rendered null and void to all intents and purposes  and those six precious years of womanhood put under a   207 statute of virginity  What  shall I call that rancid passion love  which passes between an old batchelor of fifty six and a widow lady of forty nine  Never  never  What advantage is society to reap from an intercourse  where the big belly is oftnest on the man s side  Would any persuade me that such a passion was natural  unless the human race were more fit for love as they approach d the decline  and  like silk worms  became breeders  just before they expired    Whether love be natural or no  replied my friend  gravely  it contributes to the happiness of every society into which it is introduced  All our pleasures are short  and can only charm at intervals  love is a method of protracting our greatest pleasure  and surely that gamester  who plays the greatest stake to the best advantage  will at the end of life  rise victorious  This was the opinion of Vanini  who affirmed that every hour was lost which was not spent in love  His accusers were unable to comprehend his meaning  and the poor advocate for love was burned in flames  alas  no way metaphorical  But whatever advantages the individual may reap from this passion  society will certainly be refined and improved by its introduction  All laws  calculated to discourage it  tend to embrute the species  and weaken the state  Though it cannot plant morals in the human breast  it cultivates them when there  pity  generosity  and honour  receive a brighter polish from its assistance  and a single amour is sufficient entirely to brush off the clown   But it is an exotic of the most delicate constitution  it requires the greatest art to introduce it   208 into a state  and the smallest discouragement is sufficient to repress it again  Let us only consider with what ease it was formerly extinguished in Rome  and with what difficulty it was lately revived in Europe  it
