 than those of false honour  and shews what his sister says to be true  that he regards first his duty  and then what is called honour  How does the knowlege of these his excellencies raise him in my mind  Indeed  Lucy  I seem sometimes to feel  as if my gratitude had raised a throne or him in my heart  but yet as for a dear friend  as   295 a beloved brother only  My reverence for him is too great—Assure yourself  my dear  that this reverence will always keep me right   Sir Charles and Mr  Reeves returning into company  the conversation took a general turn  But  oppressed with obligations as I am  I could not be lively  My heart  as Miss Grandison says  is  I believe  a proud one  And when I thought of what might still happen  who knows  but from assassination  in resentment of some very spirited strokes in Sir Charles s Letter  as well as from the disgrace the wretch must carry in his face to the grave   I could not but look upon this fine man  who seemed to possess his own soul in peace  sometimes with concern  and even with tender grief  on supposing  that now  lively and happy  as he seemed to be  and the joy of all his friends  he might possibly  and perhaps in a few hours—How can I put down my horrid thoughts   At other times  indeed  I cast an eye of some pleasure on him  when he looked another way  on thinking him the only man on earth  to whom  in such distress  I could have wished to owe the obligations I am under to him  His modest merit  thought I  will not make one uneasy  He thinks the protection afforded but a common protection  He is accustomed to do great and generous things  I might have been obliged to a man whose fortune might have made it convenient for him to hope such advantages from the risque he run for me  as prudence would have made objections to comply with  not a little embarrassing to my gratitude   But here my heart is left free  And O  thought I  now and then  as I looked upon him  Sir Charles Grandison is a man with whom I would not wish to be in Love  I  to have so many rivals  He to be so much admired  Women not to stay till they are asked  as Miss Grandison once said  his heart must be proof against those tender sensations  which grow into ardour    296 and glow  in the bosom of a man pursuing a first and only Love   I warrant  my Lucy  if the truth were known  altho  Sir Charles has at Canterbury  or at one place or other  his half score Ladies  who would break their hearts if he were to marry  yet he knows not any one of them whom he loves better than another  And all but right  All but justice  if they will not stay till they are asked   Miss Grandison invited Mr  and Mrs  Reeves  and me  to dinner  on Wednesday  and for the rest of the day and evening  It was a welcome invitation   The Countess expressed herself pleased with me  Poor and spiritless as was the figure which I made in this whole visit  her prepossession in my favour from Miss Grandison must have been very great and generous   And will you not  before now  have expected  that I should have brought you acquainted with the persons of Lord and Lady L  as I am accustomed to give you descriptions of every one to whom I am introduced   To be sure we have  say you   Well  but my mind has not always been in tune to gratify you  And  upon my word  I am so much humbled with one thing and another  that I have lost all that pertness  I think  which used to give such a liveliness to my heart  and alertness to my pen  as made the writing task pleasant to me  because I knew that you all condescended to like the flippant airs of your Harriet   Lady L  is a year older than Sir Charles  But has that true female softness and delicacy in her features  which make her perfectly lovely  and she looks to be two or three years younger than she is  She is tall and slender  and enjoys the blessing of health and spirits in an high degree  There is something of more dignity and sprightliness in the air and features of Miss Grandison  than in those of Lady L  But there is in   297 those of the latter  so much sweetness and complacency  that you are not so much afraid of her as you are of her sister  The one you are sure to love at first sight  The other you will be ready to ask leave to let you love her  and to be ready to promise that you will  if she will spare you  And yet  whether she will or not  you cannot help it   Lady L  is such a wife  I imagine  as a good
