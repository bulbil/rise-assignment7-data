drawn only by Apelles  so would I say to all those who leave mind out of the description of Miss Byron  That they are not to  describe her  This young Lady   You may look proud  Harriet    has united in her face  feature  complexion  grace  and expression  which very few women  even of those who are most celebrated for beauty  have singly in equal degree  But  what is infinitely more valuable  she has an heart that is equally pure and open  She has a fine mind  And it is legible in her face  Have you not observed  Charlotte  added he  what intelligence her very silence promises  And yet  when she speaks  she never disappoints the most raised expectations      I was speechless  Lucy   Well  brother  continued Miss Grandison—If there is not every thing you say in Miss Byron s face and mind  there seems to me little less than the warmth of Love in the description—You are another Apelles  Sir  if his colours were the most glowing of those of all painters   My eyes had the assurance to ask Miss Grandison  What answer he returned to this  She saw they had   Ah  Harriet  smilling—That s a meaning look  with all its bashfulness  This was my brother s answer—   Every body must love Miss Byron—You know  Charlotte  that I presented her to you  and you to her  as a third sister  And what man better loves his sisters  than your brother      We both looked down  Harriet  but not quite so silly  and so dissappointed a you now look—  Dear Miss Grandison —  Well  then another time don t let your eyes ask questions  instead of your lips   Third sister  my Lucy  Indeed I believe I looked silly enough  To say the truth  I was dissappointed   Har  And this was all that passed  You hear by my question  Ladies  that my lips will keep my eyes in countenance     298Miss Gr  It was  for he retired as soon as he had said this   Har  How retired  madam —Any discompo—You laugh at my folly  at my presumption perhaps—  They both smiled  No  I can t say that there seemed to be either in his word or manner  any distinguishing emotion  any great discompo—He was about to retire before   Well  Ladies  I will only say  That the best thing I can do  is  to borrow a chariot and six  and drive away to Northamptonshire   But wh yo  Harriet   Because it is impossible but I must suffer in your brother s opinion  every time he sees me  and that whether I am silent or speaking   They made me fine compliments  But they would indeed have been fine ones  could they have made them from their brother   Well  but  Lucy  don t you think  that had Sir Charles Grandison meant any thing  he would have expressed himself to his sisters in such high terms  before he had said one very distinguishing thing to me  Let me judge by myself—Men and women  I believe  are so much alike  that  put custom  tyrant custom  out of the question  the meaning of the one may be generally guessed at by that of the other  in cases where the heart is concerned  What civil  what polite things  could I allow myself to say to and of Mr  Orme  and Mr  Fowler  How could I praise the honesty and goodness of their hearts  and declare my pity for them  And why  Because I meant nothing more by it all  than a warmer kind of civility  that I was not afraid to let go  as their merits pulled —And now  methinks  I can better guess  than I could till now  at what Mr  Greville meant  when he wished me to declare  that I hated him  Sly wretch —since the woman who uses a man insolently in courtship  certainly makes that man of more importance to her  than she would wish him to think himself —    299 But why am I studious to torment myself  What will be  must    Who knows what Providence has designed for Sir Charles Grandison    —May he be happy  But indeed  my Lucy  your Harriet is much otherwise  at this time     LETTER XXXI  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   Wednesday  March 15   I WILL not let you lose the substance of a very agreeable conversation  which we had last night after supper  You may be sure I thought it the more agreeable  as Sir Charles was drawn in to bear a considerable part in it  It would be impossible to give you more than passages  because the subjects were various  and the transitions so quick  by one person asking this question  another that  that I could not  were I to try  connect them as I endeavour generally to do   Of one subject  Lucy  I particularly owe you some account  Miss Grandison  in her lively
