George s situation is changed since she consented to his marriage       I am not capricious  but I will own to you  that my esteem for Sir George is much lessened by his behaviour since his last return from New York  he mistakes me extremely  if he supposes he has the least additional merit in my eyes from his late acquisition of fortune  on the contrary  I now see faults in him which were concealed by the mediocrity of his situation before  and which do not promise happiness to a heart like mine  a heart which has little taste for the false glitter of life  and the most lively one possible for the calm real delights of friendship  and domestic felicity       Accept my sincerest congratulations on your return of health  and believe me        My dearest Madam   Your obliged and affectionate  EMILY MONTAGUE     LETTER XLV   45   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Silleri  Nov  23   I HAVE been seeing the last ship go out of the port  Lucy  you have no notion what a melancholy sight it is  we are now left to ourselves  and shut up from all the world for the winter  somehow we seem so forsaken  so cut off from the rest of human kind  I cannot bear the idea  I sent a thousand sighs and a thousand tender wishes to dear England  which I never loved so much as at this moment       Do you know  my dear  I could cry if I was not ashamed  I shall not absolutely be in spirits again this week        Tis the first time I have felt any thing like bad spirits in Canada  I followed the ship with my eyes till it turned Point Levi  and  when I lost sight of it  felt as if I had lost every thing dear to me on earth  I am not particular  I see a gloom on every countenance  I have been at church  and think I never saw so many dejected faces in my life       Adieu  for the present  it will be a fortnight before I can send this letter  another agreable circumstance that  would to Heaven I were in England  though I changed the bright sun of Canada for a fog   Dec  1       We have had a week s snow without intermission  happily for us  your brother and the Fitz have been weather bound all the time at Silleri  and cannot possibly get away       We have amused ourselves within doors  for there is no stirring abroad  with playing at cards  playing at shuttlecock  playing the fool  making love  and making moral reflexions  upon the whole  the week has not been very disagreable       The snow is when we wake constantly up to our chamber windows  we are literally dug out of it every morning       As to Quebec  I give up all hopes of ever seeing it again  but my comfort is  that the people there cannot possibly get to their neighbors  and I flatter myself very few of them have been half so well entertained at home       We shall be abused  I know  for  what is really the fault of the weather  keeping these two creatures here this week  the ladies hate us for engrossing two such fine fellows as your brother and Fitzgerald  as well as for having vastly more than our share of all the men  we generally go out attended by at least a dozen  without any other woman but a lively old French lady  who is a flirt of my father s  and will certainly be my mamma       We sweep into the general s assembly on Thursdays with such a train of beaux as draws every eye upon us  the rest of the fellows crowd round us  the misses draw up  blush  and flutter their fans  and your little Bell sits down with such a saucy impertinent consciousness in her countenance as is really provoking  Emily on the contrary looks mild and humble  and seems by her civil decent air to apologize to them for being so much more agreable than themselves  which is a fault I for my part am not in the least inclined to be ashamed of       Your idea of Quebec  my dear  is perfectly just  it is like a third or fourth rate country town in England  much hospitality  little society  cards  scandal  dancing  and good chear  all excellent things to pass away a winter evening  and peculiarly adapted to what I am told  and what I begin to feel  of the severity of this climate       I am told they abuse me  which I can easily believe  because my impertinence to them deserves it  but what care I  you know  Lucy  so long as I please myself  and am at Silleri out of the sound       They are squabbling at Quebec  I hear  about I cannot tell what  therefore shall not attempt to explain  some dregs of old disputes  it seems  which have had not time to settle  however  we new comers have certainly nothing to do with these matters  you
