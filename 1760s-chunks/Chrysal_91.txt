much credit  and money too          Why  that s true  John   but then you should also remember   the cursed scrape you brought me into about the young fellow who   wrote the threatening letters to the farmer  about burning his bams     you undertook to prove that too   but you know how you left me         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 87     in the lurch  after I had gone such lengths as had like to have ruined   me  Plain swearing mil not always do  though never so home    you should remember that   you should attend to circumstances   also  But as to this afiair  let me hear what you can make of it          Your worship must know that I  and two or three more of our   people  having nothing to do  shammed a quarrel  in which a gentle    man  who was coming by  lost his hat  It was a large hat  with a   very broad gold lace  such as your foreigners wear  It was I that   shoved off the hat  and seeing a shabby  idle looking young fellow   standing by without one  I took it up  and  asking him if it was   his  reached it to him  and saw him make off with it directly  Now    if this is not a plain robbery  I do not know what is  A fellow runs   away with a gentleman s hat  who advertises it  with a reward   for taking the thief  whom he wiU prosecute  Now I have found   out the fellow s haunts  for indeed  I dogged him  and will have him    self whenever you please  and can clench the prosecution  by swear    ing that I saw him carry off the hat   and you know I need say   no more  nor take any notice who gave it him          Why  John  there may be something in this afiair  I hke it very   well  John   and so  clerk  you may enter him on the hst for next   sessions  This affair has a good look   nor is there anything unjust   in it   for  though you gave him the hat  as he knew it was not his   own  and yet carried it off  he is guilty of the theft  and that is the   same as robbery  in justice  though it may not in law   and justice   is the thing to go by with a safe conscience  And so you may go    John   I wiU let you know when it is proper to have him taken up    only have an eye to him  for fear anyone else should snap him out of   our haads  Who comes next 1 Richard Sly  you say you have   found out the knot of young fellows that have begun to infest the   streets for some nights past          Ay  please your worship    says Sly  shrugging up his shoulders   and grinning     I have found them out to be sure   and well I might    for it was I first set them on the lay          How  Richard   take care of what you say          Oh   your worship  never fear Dick Sly for a shppery trick     I know what I say very well   I have known for some time that   these youths have been playing a small game  cribbing frota the tiU    and building sconces  and such like tricks  that there was no taking   hold off   I  therefore  thought it would be right to bring them to   justice  at any rate  and so laid the plan of tMs gang  and entered   them into the business myself  and now  whenever you have a mind   to nab them  you need only take me up  and I can peach them aU    which will be no bad affair  there are so many of them          Why  that is true  Richard   but they have done nothing yet   that deserves so severe a remedy as the gaUows   therefore let them   alone   perhaps they may mend  or  if they do not  it wiU be time   enougli to take them up when they deserve it more than now    To be sure your peaching them  who first drew them in  is not so   very just   but then the law will support you in it  and  whUe a man   has the law on his side  he
