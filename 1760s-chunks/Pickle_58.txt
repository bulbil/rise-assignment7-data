in the characters of these wrong headed  enthusiasts  It was a constant practice with them  in their midnight  consistories  to swallow such plentiful draughts of inspiration  that  their mysteries commonly ended like those of the Bacchanalian orgia  and  they were seldom capable of maintaining that solemnity of decorum which   by the nature of their functions  most of them were obliged to profess   Now  as Peregrine s satirical disposition was never more gratified than  when he had an opportunity of exposing grave characters in ridiculous  attitudes  he laid a mischievous snare for his new confederates  which  took effect in this manner   In one of their nocturnal deliberations   he promoted such a spirit of good fellowship by the agreeable sallies  of his wit  which were purposely leveled against their political  adversaries  that by ten o clock they were all ready to join in the most  extravagant proposal that could be made  They broke their glasses in  consequence of his suggestion  drank healths out of their shoes  caps   and the bottoms of the candlesticks that stood before them  sometimes  standing with one foot on a chair  and the knee bent on the edge of  the table  and when they could no longer stand in that posture  setting  their bare posteriors on the cold floor  They huzzaed  hallooed  danced   and sang  and  in short  were elevated to such a pitch of intoxication   that when Peregrine proposed that they should burn their periwigs  the  hint was immediately approved  and they executed the frolic as one man   Their shoes and caps underwent the same fate by the same instigation   and in this trim he led them forth into the street  where they resolved  to compel everybody they should find to subscribe to their political  creed  and pronounce the Shibboleth of their party  In the achievement  of this enterprise  they met with more opposition than they expected   they were encountered with arguments which they could not well  withstand  the noses of some  and eyes of others  in a very little  time bore the marks of obstinate disputation  Their conductor having at  length engaged the whole body in a fray with another squadron which was    6 22 15  3 45 PM   pretty much in the same condition  he very fairly gave them the slip   and slyly retreated to his apartment  foreseeing that his companions  would soon be favoured with the notice of their superiors  nor was he  deceived in his prognostic  the proctor  going his round  chanced to  fall in with this tumultuous uproar  and  interposing his authority   found means to quiet the disturbance  He took cognizance of their names   and dismissed the rioters to their respective chambers  not a little  scandalized at the behaviour of some among them  whose business and  duty it was to set far other examples for the youth under their care and  direction   About midnight  Pipes  who had orders to attend at a distance  and keep  an eye upon Jolter  brought home that unfortunate governor upon his  back  Peregrine having beforehand secured his admittance into the  college  and among other bruises  he was found to have received a couple  of contusions on his face  which next morning appeared in a black circle  that surrounded each eye   This was a mortifying circumstance to a man of his character and  deportment  especially as he had received a message from the proctor   who desired to see him forthwith  With great humility and contrition  he begged the advice of his pupil  who being used to amuse himself with  painting  assured Mr  Jolter that he would cover those signs of disgrace  with a slight coat of flesh colour so dexterously  that it would be  almost impossible to distinguish the artificial from the natural skin   The rueful governor  rather than expose such opprobrious tokens to the  observation and censure of the magistrate  submitted to the expedient   Although his counsellor had overrated his own skill  he was persuaded to  confide in the disguise  and actually attended the proctor  with such  a staring addition to the natural ghastliness of his features  that  his visage bore a very apt resemblance to some of those ferocious  countenances that hang over the doors of certain taverns and ale houses   under the denomination of the Saracen s head   Such a remarkable alteration of physiognomy could not escape the notice  of the most undiscerning beholder  much less the penetrating eye of his  severe judge  already whetted with what he had seen over night  He was  therefore upbraided with this ridiculous and shallow artifice  and   together with the companions of his debauch  underwent such a cutting  reprimand for the scandalous irregularity of his conduct  that all of  them remained crest fallen  and were ashamed  for many weeks  to appear  in the public execution of their duty   Peregrine was too vain of his finesse  to conceal the part he acted in  this comedy  with the particulars of which he regaled his companions   and thereby entailed upon himself the hate and resentment
