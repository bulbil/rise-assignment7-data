great detriment this longsuspended affair had been to his friend  and told me    317 with a grave countenance  that the Captain was grown as many years older  as it had been in hand  and was ready to rate very highly so much time lost in the prime of life  In short  he ascribed to the Captain the views and the disappointments of a military fortune hunter too plainly for his honour in my eye  had I been disposed to take proper notice of the meaning of what he said   After having heard him out  I desired the Colonel to let me know what all this meant  and what were the Captain s expectations   He paraded on again  a long time  and asked me  at last  If there were no hopes that the Lady—  None at all  interrupted I  She ha steadily declared as much  Charlotte Grandison is a woman of fine sense  She had great qualities  She has insuperable objections to the Captain  which are founded on a more perfect knowledge of the man  and of her own heart  than she could have at first  It is not my intention to depreciate him with his friend  I shall not  therefore  enter into particulars  Let me know  Colonel  what the gentleman pretends to  He is passionate  I see  I am not a tame man  But God forbid  that Captain Anderson  who hoped to be benefited by an alliance with the daughter of Sir Thomas Grandison  should receive hurt  or hard treatment  from her brother   Here Colonel Martin  who had heard something of what was said  desired to speak with Colonel Mackenzie  They were not so distant  but my ear unavoidably caught part of their subject  Colonel Martin expatiated  in a very high manner  on my character  when I was abroad  He imputed bravery to me  a great article among military men  and with you Ladies  and I know not how many good qualities—And Colonel Mackenzie took him in with him to the other two gentlemen  Where  I suppose  everything that had passed was repeated     318 After a while  I was desired by Colonel Martin  in the name of the gentlemen  to walk in  he himself sitting down in the public room   They received me with respect  I was obliged to hear and say a great many things  that I had said and heard before  But at last two proposals were made me  either of which  they said  if complied with  would be taken as laying the Captain under very high obligation   Poor man  I had compassion for him  and closed with one of them  declining the other for a reason which I did not give to them  To say truth  Charlotte  I did not choose to promise my interest in behalf of a man  of whose merit I was not assured  had I been able to challenge any  as perhaps I might by Lord W  s means  who stands well with proper persons  A man ought to think himself  in some measure  accountable for warm recommendations  especially where the public is concerned  And could I give my promise  and be cool as to the performance  And I should think myself also answerable to a worthy man  and to every one connected with him  if I were a means of lifting one less worthy over his head  I chose therefore to do that service to him  for which I am responsible only to myself  After I have said this  my sister must ask me no questions   I gave a rough draught  at the Captain s request  of the manner in which I would have releases drawn  Colonel Martin was desired to walk in  And all the gentlemen promised to bury in silence and all that had ever come to their knowlege  of what had passed between Charlotte Grandison  and Captain Anderson   Let not the mentioning to you these measures  hurt you  my sister  Many young Ladies of sense and family have been drawn into still greater inconveniencies than you have suffered  Persons of eminent abilities  I have a very high opinion of my Charlotte s  seldom err in small points  Most young women who   319 begin a correspondence with our designing Sex  think they can stop when they will  But it is not so  We  and the dark spirit that sets us at work  which we sometimes mis call Love  will not permit you to do so  Men and Women are Devils to one another  They need no other tempter   All will be completed to morrow  and your written promise  of consequence  given up  I congratulate my sister on the happy conclusion of this affair  You are now your own mistress  and free to choose for yourself  I should never forgive myself  were I  who have been the means of freeing you from one controul  to endeavour to lay you under another  Think not either of Sir Walter or of Lord G  if your heart declare not in favour of either  You have sometimes thought me carnest in behalf of Lord G  But I have never spoken in his favour  but when you have put me
