it was full time to separate  My quarters were fixed in an ante room with a book case bedstead  my master s in an elegant bed chamber with every appurtenance except one  but however necessary it might be to play the disappointed bridegroom  I am much mistaken if in the bottom of his soul he was half so much afraid of sleeping by himself as of being encumbered with a bed  fellow   The rejoicings began again on the following day  and the bride was so jocund on the occasion  that the bolts of the fools among her visitors were not soon shot  She was the first to laugh at all their pointless jokes  nay  she even set the little wits to work  by giving them an example of pleasantry  which they were very little able to follow  The happy man  on his part  seemed to be very little less happy than his partner  and one would have sworn  judging by the glance of satisfaction which accompanied his language and deportment  that he liked mutton better than lamb  This well matched pair had a second conversation in the evening  and then it was decided that without interfering in the least with one another  they should live together just on the same footing as they had lived before marriage  At all events  much credit must be given to Don Manriquez on one account  he did  from delicate consideration towards his wife  what few husbands would have done under his circumstances  for he discarded a little sempstress of whom he was very fond  and who was very fond of him  because he did not choose to keep up a connection insulting to the feelings of a lady so studious of his   While he was furnishing such unusual testimonies of gratitude to his elderly benefactress  she overpaid and doubly paid her debt of obligation  even without diving into its nature or extent  She gave him the master key of her strong box  which was better provided than that of Velasquez  Though she had reduced her establishment during widowhood  it was now replaced upon the same footing as in the lifetime of her first husband  the complement of household servants was enlarged  the stud and equipages were in the very first style  in a word  by her generosity and kindness  the most beggarly knight belonging to the order of Alcantara became the most monied member of the fraternity  You may perhaps be disposed to ask me  how much I was in pocket by all that  and my answer is  fifty pistoles from my mistress  and a hundred from my master  who  moreover  appointed me his secretary  with a salary of four hundred crowns  nay  his confidence was so unbounded  that I was fixed on to fill the office of treasurer   Treasurer  cried I  interrupting Scipio at the very idea  and bursting into an immoderate fit of laughter  Yes  sir  replied he  with a cool  unflinching seriousness  you are perfectly right  treasurer was the word  and I may venture to say that the duties of the office were executed without the slightest occasion for a committee of inquiry  True it is that the balance may be somewhat against me  for I was always in the habit of overdrawing my wages  and as the firm was dissolved somewhat suddenly  it is by no means impossible that the balance of my cash account might be on the wrong side  but  at all events  it was my last slip  and since that time my ways have been ways of uprightness and honesty   Thus was I  continued this son of a gipsy  secretary and treasurer to Don Manriquez  who  to all appearance  was as happy in me as I in him  when he received a letter from Toledo  announcing that his aunt  Donna Theodora Moscoso  was on her last legs  He was so much affected by the news  as to set out instantly and pay his duty to that lady  who had been more than a mother to him for several years  I attended him on the journey with only two under servants  we were all mounted on the best horses in the stable  and reached Toledo without loss of time  where we found Donna Theodora in a state to warrant our hopes that she would not  at present  weigh anchor on her outward bound voyage  and  in fact  our judgment on her case  though point blank in contradiction to that of an old physician who attended her  proved by the event that we knew at least as much of the matter as he did   While the health of our venerable relative was improving from day to day  less  perhaps  from the effect of the prescriptions than in consequence of her dear nephew s presence  your worthy friend the treasurer passed his time in the pleasantest manner possible  with some young people whose acquaintance was admirably calculated to ventilate the confined cash in his pocket  Sometimes they enticed me to the tennis court  and took me in for a game  on those occasions  not being quite so steady a player as my master  Don Abel  I lost much oftener than I won  By degrees play became a passion with me  and if the taste had been suffered to gain complete possession  it
