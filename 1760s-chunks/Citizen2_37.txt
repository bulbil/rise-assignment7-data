least will palliate every anxiety   Adieu   LETTER LXXXVIII  From the same   IT is no unpleasing contemplation to consider the influence which soil and climate have upon the disposition of the inhabitants  the animals and vegetables of different countries  That among the brute creation is much more visible than in man  and that in vegetables more than either  In some places those plants which are entirely poisonous at home lose their deleterious quality by being carried abroad  there are serpents in Macedonia so harmless as to be used as play things for children  and we are told that in some parts of Fez there are lions so very timorous as to be scared away  though coming in herds  by the cries of women   I know of no country where the influence of climate and soil is more visible than in England  the same hidden cause which gives courage to their dogs and cocks  gives also fierceness to their men  But chiefly this ferocity appears among the vulgar  The polite of every country pretty nearly resemble each other  But as in simpleing  it is among the uncultivated productions of nature  we are to examine the characteristic differences of climate and soil  so in an estimate of the genius of the people  we must look among the sons of unpolished rusticity  The vulgar English therefore may be easily distinguished from all the rest   112 of the world  by superior pride  impatience  and a peculiar hardiness of soul   Perhaps no qualities in the world are more susceptible of a fine polish than these  artificial complaisance and easy deference being superinduced over these  generally forms a great character  something at once elegant and majestic  affable yet sincere  Such in general are the better sort  but they who are left in primitive rudeness are the least disposed for society with others  or comfort internally  of any people under the sun   The poor indeed of every country are but little prone to treat each other with tenderness  their own miseries are too apt to engross all their pity  and perhaps too they give but little commiseration  as they find but little from others  But  in England  the poor treat each other upon every occasion with more than savage animosity  and as if they were in a state of open war by nature  In China  if two porters should meet in a narrow street  they would lay down their burthens  make a thousand excuses to each other for the accidental interruption  and beg pardon on their knees  if two men of the same occupation should meet here  they would first begin to scold  and at last to beat each other  One would think they had miseries enough resulting from penury and labour not to encrease them by ill nature among themselves  and subjection to new penalties  but such considerations never weigh with them   But to recompence this strange absurdity they are in the main generous  brave  and enterprising  They feel the slightest injuries with a degree of ungoverned impatience  but resist the greatest calamities with surprizing fortitude  Those miseries   113 under which any other people in the world would sink  they have often shewed they were capable of enduring  if accidentally cast upon some desolate coast  their perseverance is beyond what any other nation is capable of sustaining  if imprisoned for crimes  their efforts to escape are greater than among others  The peculiar strength of their prisons  when compared to those elsewhere  argues their hardiness  even the strongest prisons I have ever seen in other countries would be very insufficient to confine the untameable spirit of an Englishman  In short  what man dares do in circumstances of danger  an Englishman will  His virtues seem to sleep in the calm  and are called out only to combat the kindred storm   But the greatest eulogy of this people is the generosity of their miscreants  the tenderness in general of their robbers and highwaymen  Perhaps no people can produce instances of the same kind  where the desperate mix pity with injustice  still shew that they understand a distinction in crimes  and even  in acts of violence  have still some tincture of remaining virtue  In every other country robbery and murder go almost always together  here it seldom happens  except upon ill judged resistance or pursuit  The banditti of other countries are unmerciful to a supreme degree  the highwayman and robber here are generous at least to the public  and pretend even to virtues in their intercourse among each other  Taking therefore my opinion of the English from the virtues and vices practised among the vulgar  they at once present to a stranger all their faults  and keep their virtues up only for the enquiring eye of a philosopher     114Foreigners are generally shocked at their insolence upon first coming among them  they find themselves ridiculed and insulted in every street  they meet with none of those trifling civilities  so frequent elsewhere  which are instances of mutual good will without previous acquaintance  they travel through the country either too ignorant or too obstinate to cultivate a closer acquaintance  meet every moment something to excite their disgust  and return home to characterise this as the region of spleen  insolence  and ill nature  In short  England would be the last place in the world I would travel to by way
