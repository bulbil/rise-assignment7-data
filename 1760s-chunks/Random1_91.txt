cure  which was compleated in six weeks     CHAP  XXIX   Mackshane s malice—I am taken up and imprisoned for a spy—Morgan meets with the same fate—Thomson is tempered with to turn evidence against us—disdains the proposal  and is maltreated for his integrity—Morgan is released to assist the surgeon during an engagement with some French ships of war—I remain fettered on the poop  exposed to the enemy s shot  and grow delirious with fear—am comforted after the battle by Morgan  who speaks freely of the captain  is over heard by the centinel  who informs against him  and again imprisoned—Thomson grows desperate  and notwithstanding the remonstrances of Morgan and me  goes over board in the night   IN the mean time  the storm subsided into a brisk gale  that carried us into the warm latitudes  where the weather became intolerable and the crew very sickly —The doctor left nothing   260 unattempted towards the completion of his vengeance against the Welchman and me  He went among the sick under pretence of enquiring into their grievances  with a view of picking up complaints to our prejudice  but finding himself frustrated in that expectation  by the good will we had procured from the patients by our diligence and humanity  he took the resolution of listening to our conversation  by hiding himself behind the canvas that surrounded our birth  here too he was detected by the boy of our mess  who acquainted us with this piece of behaviour  and one night  while we were picking a large bone of salt beef  Morgan discerned something stir against our hangings  which immediately interpreting to be the doctor  he tipt me the wink  and pointed to the place  where I could evidently perceive some body standing  upon which  I snatched up the bone  and levelled it with all my force at him  saying     Whoever you are  take that for your curiosity  —  It had the desired effect  for we heard the listener tumble down  and afterwards crawl to his own cabbin —I applauded myself much for this feat  which turned out one of the most unlucky exploits of my life  Mackshane from that night marking me out for destruction —About a week thereafter  as I was going my rounds among the sick  I was taken prisoner  and carried to the poop by the master at arms  where I was loaded with irons  and stapled to the deck  on pretence that I was a spy on board  and had conspired against the captain s life —How ridiculous soever this imputation was  I did not fail to suffer by it all the rigour that could be shewn to the worst of criminals  being exposed in this miserable condition to the scorching   261 heat of the sun by day  and the unwholesome damps by night  during the space of twelve days  in which time I was neither brought to trial  nor examined touching the probability of my charge —I had no sooner recovered the use of my reflection  which had been quite overthrown by this accident  than I sent for Thomson  who  after condoling with me on the occasion  hinted to me  that I owed this misfortune to the hatred of the doctor  who had given in an information against me to the captain  in consequence of which I was arrested  and all my papers seized —While I was cursing my capricious fate  I saw Morgan ascend the poop  guarded by two corporals  who made him sit down by me  that he might be pinioned in the same machine —Notwithstanding my situation  I could scarce refrain from laughing at the countenance of my fellow prisoner  who  without speaking one word  allowed his seet to be inclosed in the rings provided for that purpose  but when they pretended to fasten him on his back  he grew outragious  and drawing a large cuteau from his side pocket  threatened to rip up the belly of the first man who should approach him  in order to treat him in such an unworthy manner —They were preparing to use him very roughly  when the lieutenant on the quarterdeck  called up to them to let him remain as he was —He then crept towards me  and taking me by the hand  bid me   put my trust in Got  —  And looking at Thomson  who sat by us trembling  with a pale visage  told him  there were two more rings for his feet  and he should be glad to find him in such good company —But it was not the intention of our adversary to include the second mate in our fate  Him he excepted   262 to be his drudge in attending the sick  and if possible  his evidence against us  With this view he sounded him afar off  but finding his integrity incorruptible  he harrassed him so much out of spite  that in a short time this mild creature grew weary of his life     While I and my fellow prisoner comforted each other in our tribulation  the admiral discovered four sail of ships to leeward  and made signal for our ship and four more to chace  Hereupon  every thing was cleared for an engagement  and Mackshane foreseeing he would have occasion for more assistants than one  obtained Morgan s liberty  while I was left in this deplorable posture to
