day in the presence of such a master   The doctor tells me  that he had last week presented the elder Mr  Oldham with a pair of Colours  which he had purchased for him  Nobody had heard of this   Lord W  he says  is preparing for Windsor  Mr  Beauchamp for Hampshire  for a few days  and then he returns to attend the commands of the noble Italians  Lady Olivia will soon have her equi ready  She will make a great appearance  But Sir CHARLES GRANDISON will not be with her  What is grandeur to a disturbed heart  The Earl of G  and Lady Gertrude are setting out for Hertfordshire  Lord and Lady L  talk of retiring  for a few weeks  to Colnebrooke  The Doctor is preparing for Grandison hall  your poor Harriet for Northamptonshire—Bless me  my dear  what a dispersion —But Lord W  s nuptials will collect some of them together at Windsor   EMILY  the dear weeping girl  is just come  She is with my cousins  She expects my permission for coming up to me  Imagine us weeping over each other  praying for  blessing the guardian of us both  Your imagination cannot form a scene too tender  Adieu  my Lucy     173  LETTER XXIV  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   Sunday  April 16   O What a blank  my dear —But I need not say what I was going to say  Poor Emily —But to mention her grief  is to paint my own   Lord W  went to Windsor Yesterday   A very odd behaviour of Lady Olivia  Mr  Beauchamp went yesterday  and offered to attend her to any of the publick places  at her pleasure  in pursuance of Sir Charles s reference to him  to do all in his power to make England agreeable to her  And she thought fit to tell him before her aunt  that she thanked him for his civility  but she should not trouble him during her stay in England  She had gentlemen in her train  and one of them had been in England before—He left her in disgust   Lady L  making her a visit in the evening  she told her of Mr  Beauchamp s offer  and of her answer  The gentleman  said she  is a polite and very agreeable man  and this made me treat his kind offer with abruptness  For I can hardly doubt your brother s view in it  I scorn his view  And if I were sure of it  perhaps I should find a way to make him repent of the Indignity  Lady L  was sure  she said  that neither her brother  nor Mr  Beauchamp  had any other views than to make England as agreeable to her as possible   Be this as it may  madam  said she  I have no service for Mr  Beauchamp  But if your Ladyship  your sister  and your two Lords  will allow me to cultivate your friendship  you will do me honour  Dr  Bartlett s company will be very agreeable to me likewise  as often as he will give it me  To Miss Jervois I lay some little claim  I would have had her for my   174 companion in Italy  but your cruel brother—No more  however  of him  Your English beauty too  I admire her  But  poor young creature  I admire her the more  because I can pity her  I should think myself very happy to be better acquainted with her   Lady L  made her a very polite answer for herself and her sister  and their Lords  But told her  that I was very soon to set out for my own abode in Northamptonshire  and that Dr  Bartlett had some commissions  which would oblige him  in a day or two  to go to Sir Charles s seat in the country  She herself offered to attend her to Windsor  and to every other place  at her command   LADY L  took notice of her wrist being bound round with a broad black ribband  and asked  If it were hurt  A kind of sprain  said she  But you little imagine how it came  and must not ask   This made Lady L  curious  And Olivia requesting that Emily might be allowed to breakfast with her as this morning  she has bid the dear girl endeavour to know how it came  if it fell in her way  For Olivia reddened  and looked up  with a kind of consciousness  to Lady L  when she told her that she must not ask questions about it   Lady G  is very earnest with me to give into the town diversions for a month to come  But I have now no desire in my heart so strong  as to throw myself at the feet of my grandmamma and aunt  and to be embraced by my Lucy and Nancy  and all my Northamptonshire Loves  I am only afraid of my uncle  He will railly his Harriet  yet only  I know  in hopes to divert her  and us all  But my jesting days are over  My situation will not bear it  Yet if it will divert himself
