was most culpable  as his crime was most unnatural  easily obtained it   The severities exercised in the latter part of this reign arose merely from the influence of the Duke   68 of York  who was as much inclined to cruelty by nature  as his brother Charles was prone to forgiveness  His authority was become terrible even to the ministry  by his advice the King seized upon all the charters of the corporations  in order to extort money for having them renewed  Partiality and oppression were the instruments of his power  and bigotry and innovation the objects of his aim  At this period the reign of Charles was as absolute as that of any Monarch in Christendom  and new discontents and treasons were secretly diffusing their poison  the spirit of liberty still struggling hard against the spirit of obedience  which the clergy attempted to inculcate  Another civil war threatened the nation  still more dreadful than the former  as the forces were more equally divided  But Charles happily died before those calamities could return  he was suddenly seized with an apoplectic fit  in the fifty fourth year of his age  and the twenty fifth of his reign  The people  though they despised his administration  loved his person  they were willing to bear with the faults of one whose whole behaviour was a continued instance of good nature and affability  but they were by no means willing to grant the same indulgence to his successor  whom they hated for his pride  his religion  his cruelty  and connections  He was unfit to walk in the irregular steps of his predecessor  and  when he pursued the same route  fatal experience soon convinced him that he had at once mistaken himself and the people he attempted to command   But  though England  during the reign of Charles  seemed still  in some measure  agitated like the ocean after a storm  yet commerce continued to increase with its usual celerity and success  The manufacture of certain stuffs  glass  copper  steel  paper  hats  and stockings  were now brought to perfection  Upon the banishing the Protestants from   69 France  numbers came and settled here  and brought their arts with them  This application to arts and commerce gave England great weight in the balance of Europe  Britain became the center of politics and arms  Though literature was but little encouraged by the Sovereign  yet the learned made great proficiency in every department of science  and the philosophers of England began to take the lead  Newton  Tillotson  Burnet  Hobbes  and Shaftesbury enlarged the land marks of human knowledge  Butler  Dryden  Otway  gave strength and propriety to the language  In a word  the character of the nation now began to alter  the natural rudeness of the inhabitants began to take a polish from good breeding  and British ferocity to meliorate into charity and humanity   I am   c   LETTER IX   AS we descend  we find the materials for English history increase  the minutest transactions are recorded with prolixity  and these  however dry and unimproving to some  are yet both interesting and satisfactory to others  In such a profusion of materials I must be content rather to give the spirit of the following reigns  than pretend to exhibit an historical detail of particular interests and intrigues  It will be enough to mark those strong out lines that may probably escape the wreck of time  when the internal colouring shall fade  As history increases in time by the addition of new events  an epitome becomes more necessary to abridge its excrescences   The Duke of York  who succeeded his brother  with the title of King James the Second  had been bred a Papist  and was strongly bigotted to his principles    70 It is the property of that religion  almost ever  to contract the sphere of the understanding  and  until people are  in some measure  disengaged from its prejudices  it is impossible to lay a just claim to extensive views  or consistency of design  The intellects of this Prince were naturally weak  and his bigotted principles still rendered them more feeble  he conceived the ridiculous project of reigning in the same arbitrary manner of his predecessor  and changing the established religion of his country  at a time when his person was hated  and the established religion was universally approved   The people of England were now entirely changed from what they had been in the times of Henry  Mary  and Elizabeth  who had altered religion at will  Learning was now as much cultivated by the laity as by the priesthood  every man now pretended to think for himself  and had rational grounds for his opinion  In the beginning of the reformation the Monarchs had only to bring over the clergy  in order totally to change the modes of belief  for the people were entirely guided by their pastors  To influence the priesthood was an easy task  The hopes of preferment  or the fears of degradation  entirely subjected the consciences of the clergy to the royal will  Such it was then  but the circumstances of the nation were  at present  entirely altered  and  to make a change in religion  it would have been necessary to tamper with every individual in the state  But
