    Though your dear Letter has made me vastly easier  than I was  I am not yet calm enough to write about my Affairs to Lady —  besides  I am unwilling to determine on any thing   till I see  and consult you  Adieu   Frances   LETTER CCXLI   My Dear HARRY   I AM sorry any Accident should prevent our Letters from passing in a regular Course  Indeed it is of little Consequence what becomes Page  179 of mine  but as they may occasion a Disappointment to you   You desire to know what affects my Mind — It would be impossible to recount the Multiplicity of Things  which distress me —It is true  there is a Cause painfully eminent above the rest  which  when we meet  I fear you will think too soon to know   till then  the Sorrow  it occasions  shall be all my own    For it is the Wretch s Comfort still to have some little Hoard of Grief  some unknown Woe  which they may weep  and wail  and  Glutton like  devour alone     Indeed  my dearest Life  I would rather suffer any Thing  than distress you  I am sincerely sorry  I even mentioned my Illness to you  but I will complain no more  therefore pardon what is past   I have been in a continual Hurry all Day  It is now very late  so must conclude with wishing you a thousand times good Night   Page  180  LETTER CCXLII  HENRY to FRANCES   My Dearest Life   I SENT off an Express to —  and recovered your Letter of the third  I return you Lady — s Letter  which is very kind  You cannot imagine what Pleasure your saying she stays here for the Winter has given me  It is a very lucky  as well as pleasing Circumstance for you  at this particular Time  which is enough to shew you  how happy this Account has made me          I shall go to Town in the Beginning of the Term  but am extremely uneasy to know what is the Meaning of the Hint  you gave me in your last Letter    that you have something to say to me  which you will not mention   till we meet   I beg  my Fanny  you will explain yourself by next Post     I am now returned to Montaigne  which I quitted for Pliny  at your Request  and I make it a Rule to give you my Observations upon every Book I read   Page  181In his History of the three most excellent Men  he names Homer  Alexander  and Epaminondas  By Excellence  here  he seems merely to consider this Expression  with regard to Fame only  But I think he has not  as one might expect  given us Examples from different Classes  The first is a Poet  the second a Soldier  and so is the third  when I expected a Philosopher  and here I would name Plato  or better  Socrates  But perhaps Montaigne considered Epaminondas in this Class  and in the highest Degree  as he is recorded to have practised what others only teach   Montaigne makes a good Defence for representing human Nature not much to it s Advantage  as  in general  the French Writers are apt to do   Others make Men  I but report them    I am pleased to find he had some of my Whims  He mentions one  which  you may remember  I sometimes hinted to you  of taking a particular Fancy to some one Glass laid down at Table  though of equal Dimensions with the rest  out of which I often take a greater Pleasure in drinking  nay  I have gone so far  once or twice  as to pay a Man s Club for the Exchange of his Glass  Whence such Caprices  as this  proceed  I do not remember that any of the Expositors upon human Nature have accounted  and I think it would be an ingenious and amusing Subject to inquire into   Page  182This puts me in Mind of a Theme  I have a great Mind to recommend for a Premium to the Society of Dijon  in France  which is an Essay upon Metaphorical Taste  being a Liking  or Admiration  not confined to  or deducible from  the established Rules of Beauty  Harmony  Order  or Truth  which should be the natural or rational Foundations of our Approbation  Why is the Mind of Man  when endued with what is called Taste  delighted with extravagant Flights in Poetry  extraordinary Metaphors  Excesses in Grammar  Chromatics in Music   c  How come we to be charmed with Things  which offend common Sense  or shock the natural Ear  And from what Turn of Caprice does it proceed  that the very Errors and Faults of some of the Arts and Sciences are esteemed as Beauties  Nay  to shew that Taste is not only above  but even sometimes averse from rational Admiration  we need but recollect the Pleasure we receive from viewing some of the Deformities of Nature  as Rocks  Precipices   c  and
