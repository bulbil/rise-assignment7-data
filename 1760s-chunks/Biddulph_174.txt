at a coffee house in Pall mall  that as he was delivering it  he perceived another letter lying on the bar  directed to Sir George Bidulph  The two names struck him  remembering them to be those of his cousin  His uncle  he supposed  was dead  but he determined to enquire who that gentleman was  and if he found it to be my brother  to apply to him for assistance  He had soon an opportunity of being satisfied  my    brother happened to come in his chariot to the door  just as Mr Warner was going out  he knew the arms  and had some recollection even of his features  It was past three o’clock  and I heard Sir George direct his servant home  I concluded he was going to dinner  and that the morning was the properest time to call on him  and having informed myself where he lived  I accordingly went yesterday morning   He stopped  and sipped his coffee for some time without speaking   And did you see him  Sir  Yes  Madam  I saw him  and heard him too  He has got a fine house  and seems to have every thing very elegant about him  When I was let into the hall  I desired the footman to acquaint his master that a gentleman  newly arrived from the West Indies  wanted to speak with him  being commissioned by Mr Warner  a relation of his  to enquire after him  The footman went up stairs  and returning presently  asked me if I brought a letter from the gentleman I mentioned  I said  No  but I had something to say to him   The servant  after delivering this message  came halfway down the first flight of the stairs  and leaning over the banisters  he bid me walk up  I found your brother  and his lady  I suppose  in her dressing room  at breakfast  There was tea and chocolate on the table  I bowed very respectfully  the lady scarce moved her head  your brother said  Your servant  Sir  and viewed me from head to foot  but fixed his eyes earnestly on my face  The footman who had introduced me had withdrawn  Sir  said I  have you quite forgot me  I remember you well  He answered hesitatingly  and with a change of countenance that boded me no good  I protest  Sir —I—I know nothing of you  ‘Have you forgot your cousin Ned Warner ’ He looked at his wife  and she at him  he forced a smile at her  which she returned  without knowing for what  ‘I do remember there was such a one related to the family  whom we all supposed to be dead  as for recollecting his person—’tis really so long ago—that I—can’t say I do ‘ All this while he let me stand  he was lolling in an easy chair  and had a dish of chocolate in his hand  of which he sipped and spoke to me by turns  His wife was feeding a monkey that was perched on her shoulder   I am indeed more altered than you  Sir George  the hardships which I have undergone  and my long residence in a warmer climate  may readily account for that  but have you no traces of my features  No recollection of my voice  I have carried you many times in my arms  ‘Sir  I do not dispute the identity of your person  but I should    be glad to know your commands with me ‘ Commands I have none  Sir  the poor must entreat  not command   I then proceeded to tell him my unhappy story in the same words I just now gave it to you  His lady seemed not to mind me  but kept talking to her marmouset  He listened to me  but with so much impatience in his looks  as quite abashed me  I was still standing  but a little to take off the aukwardnes of my posture  I had ventured to rest one arm on the back of a chair   When I had done speaking  your brother got up in a violent passion  to which he seemed to have been working himself up during the time I took to explain myself  He whisked away the chair on which I was leaning  and walked to the other end of the room  then turning to his lady  Is not this a pretty fellow to force his way in upon us  by a sham story of a message from a relation  and now truly by way of an agreeable surprize he turns out to be that very relation come a begging in his own proper person  Sir  said I  I ask your pardon for the liberty I took to gain admittance to you  but you will be the more inclined to excuse me  if you please to consider that it was out of respect to you that I would not in the mean appearance I now make  acknowledge myself to any of your servants  for the same reason I imagined  that had I not sent a message which I was in hopes would have a little interested you in my favour  I might have been ordered to send up my business by your footman  which would I thought have
