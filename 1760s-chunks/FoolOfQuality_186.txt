to have seen the man who  in every grace and merit    is infinitely preferable to your favourite Spelling  Where  when    my dear miss   When I am brought to the torture  I may possibly   be under the necessity of confessing  Pardon  pardon  sweet   madam   I meant no offence   and yet I wish to heaven I knew    But that you never shall know  Mr  Harry  Pray then  madam    if I may adventure on one question more  has the party so highly   favoured any knowledge of his own happiness  I hope not  Mr    Harry   but of what advantage could his knowledge prove to me  I   beseech you  Can you suppose that such a person as I have   described could deign to look with favour on such a one as I am     I do not believe  madam  that the man is in England who would   not think himself highly honoured  highly blessed  by your hand    But then are you assured  miss  that this man is worthy of it    Ah  there lies my misfortune  he is too worthy  too noble  too   accomplished  too lovely  too much every thing  for my wishes to   leave any thing to my hopes  And now  Mr  Harry  that I have   intrusted you with my secret  I hope you will not betray my con    fidence  and reveal it to my papa  I rather trust and request that   you will use some other colour for reconciling him to my refusal of   Mr  Spelling   and  to make you some amends for the mortification         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  187     I have given you  by rejecting your advocation in behalf of your   friend  I here engage never to marry without your approbation    though I do not promise  sir  that you shall dictate to my choice    There is one thing further  Mr  Clinton  in which you may oblige   me   it is to prevail on my father to dismiss these assemblies and   revels that pester our house   indeed  they never were to my taste    though by their novelty  at first  they might have helped to amuse   a little matter of melancholy that hung upon my mind   but now   they are grown quite insufferable to me  Here her eye began to   fill  and  heaving a gentle sigh  she curtsied and withdrew      Immediately my heart was softened and affected  I saw the   child of my friend and patron  the one in whom his hopes and   fortunes and very life were wrapt up I saw that she was unhappy    that she was very unhappy  at a time that she had forbidden me   to attempt her relief  though I would gladly have parted with half   my fortune to have been enabled to give the object of her wishes   to her arms      In the mean while  my dearest madam  it was the farthest of all   things from entering into my imagination  that I was the very   person who sat so near her heart  I daily saw the loveliest youths   and titled chiefs of the land attendant on her words and smiles  and   humbly suing for her favour   I saw also  that her immense fortune   and rare attractions justly entitled her to their homage  and I was   neither vain enough  nor base enough  to attempt a competition      As in myself I was wholly devoid of passion  I had neither   eyes nor apprehension for the discernment of hers  Though I had   often seen  I seldom had any kind of converse with her   and where   the head is engaged and in a manner absorbed by business  there   is neither leisure nor room for love to enter the heart  On the   other hand  a person affected can instantly penetrate the bosom of   the party beloved  and there discern a vacant and insensible heart    as legibly as a priest of Isis could decipher hieroglyphics      One day  as I happened to pass near her antechamber  I heard the   warble  as I thought  of distant and ethereal music  i approached   toward the sound   the door was on the jar  and  gently opening   it  I entered and stood behind her unperceived  She sat and sung   to her lute  The words were Shakspeare s  but sweetly set by   herself  They expressed that passage in his play of Twelfth Night    where it is said of Viola        She never told her love    But let concealment  like a worm i  the bud    Feed on her damask
