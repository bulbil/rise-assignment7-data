thinking it genteel to express aloud the inward chucklings of his heart at our dainty fare  winked and nodded his delight  and spoke by signs  which I returned with the like dumb eloquence of overflowing satisfaction  The remove was a dish of roast quails  flanking a little leveret in high order  just kept long enough  for this we left our hash  good as it was  and gorged ourselves to a surfeit on the game  When we had eaten as if we had never eaten before  and pledged one another in due proportion  we rose from table and went into the garden to look out for some cool  pleasant spot  and take our afternoon s nap voluptuously   If hitherto my secretary had goggled satisfaction at what he had seen  he stared wider and grinned broader at this vista vision of the garden  He scarcely allowed the comparison to be in favour of the Escurial  The reason of its extreme niceness was that Don Caesar  who came backwards and forwards to Lirias  took pleasure in improving and ornamenting it  All the walks well gravelled and lined with orange trees  a large reservoir of white marble  with a lion in bronze spouting water like a dolphin s deputy in the middle  the beauty of the flower borders  the profusion and variety of the fruit trees  such pretty particulars as these made Scipio smack his lips and snuff the air  but his raptures reached their summit at the gradual descent of a long walk  leading to the bailiff s cottage  and over arched by the interwoven boughs of the trees planted on each side  While eulogizing a place so well adapted for a refuge from the intenseness of the heat  we made a halt  and sat down at the foot of an elm  where sleep required very little cunning to entangle two high fed  half tipsy blades  just risen from so voluptuous and voracious a repast   In about two hours we were startled out of our sleep by the report of musketry  popping so near the head quarters of our repose that we apprehended the camp to be attacked  On the alert  was the first idea that invaded our dozing minds  That we might procure the most authentic intelligence  in what direction the enemy was approaching  we directed our march towards the bailiff s tenement  There were collected eight or ten clodhoppers  all friends and neighbours  assembled on the green for the purpose of honouring my arrival  just communicated to the vacant senses of the said clodhoppers  by a discharge of fire  arms  whose barrels and furniture might thank me for the unusual favour of a thorough cleaning  The greater part of them were acquainted with my person  having seen me more than once at the castle  while engaged in the business of my stewardship  No sooner did they set eyes on me  than they all shouted in unison  Long life to our new lord and master  welcome to Lirias  Then they loaded once again  and fired another volley in honour of the occasion  My habits and manners were softened down to the most condescending urbanity  though with a decorous infusion of distance  lest any degrading constructions might he put upon too unlimited a freedom of address  With respect to my protection  I promised it according to the customary charter of newly installed possessors  and went so far as to throw them a purse of twenty pistoles  and this  in my opinion  was the point of all others in my conduct which touched their hearts most nearly  After this benefaction  I left them at liberty to waste as much powder as they pleased  and withdrew with my secretary into the wood  where we walked to and fro till night fall  without being at all tired of our rural prospect  so many charms had the view of a landscape  heightened by the substantial beauties of ownership in fee simple  to our elevated and delighted imaginations   The cook  the under cook  and the scullion were not resting upon their oars all this time  they were working hard to fit up for us an artifice of belly timber more magnificent that what we had already demolished  so that we were over head and ears in amazement  when on our return to the room where we had dined  we saw on the table a dish of four roast partridges  with a smothered rabbit on one side  and a fricasseed capon on the other  The second course consisted of pigs  ears  jugged game  and chocolate cream  We drank deeply of the most delicious wines  and began to think of going to bed  when it became a matter of doubt whether we could sit up any longer  Then my people  with lighted candles before me  led the way to the best bed room  where they were all most officious in assisting to undress me  but when they had tendered me my gown and nightcap  I dismissed them with an authoritative undulation of my hand  signifying that their services were dispensed with for the remainder of that night   Thus I sent them all about their business  keeping Scipio for a little private conference between ourselves  and I led to it by asking him what he thought of my reception  as arranged by order of my noble patrons  Indeed and indeed  answered he
