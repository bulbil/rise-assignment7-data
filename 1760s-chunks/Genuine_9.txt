reserved for their mutual demands and exigencies  The proposal was readily agreed to by both parties  who  after taking a chearful glass with their old friend  repaired to a lodging provided by Mr  C—rke the gamester  After a good supper  it was deliberated between them  what   40 steps Miss ELLIOT should pursue  and Mr  C—rke  professing the sincerest regard for his amiable companion  and lamenting the low ebb of his finances  which prevented the strongest proofs of his passion  offered to recommend her to the chief waiter at the best house in the garden  expressing  at the same time  how disagreeable it was to him to act so mean a part  as that of pimp to a pimp  but that necessity had no law  and it was prudent some times to hold a candle to the devil   Having taken this resolution  they went to bed  plighted vows of fidelity  and  after many endearing carresses  and a hearty repose  awoke in the morning  fully determined to put their plan in execution  Accordingly they adjourned about dusk to the place appointed  called for the waiter  and invited him to sit down  and take share of the claret he had brought in   Jack  who knew his business  behaved with great respect to Mr  C—rke  nor would he  till after much pressing  be perswaded to take the liberty of drinking the   41 lady s good health  When at the importunity of them both he was seated  Mr  C—rke  with a heavy sigh  thus addressed him    Ah  honest Jack  is not that an exquisite piece  What an eye  What a skin  What a panting snowy bosom  Sure I am the most unfortunate fellow on earth  to love this peerless woman to distraction—but an unlucky run at play lately  and the confounded marriage noose  prevent me from testifying the excess of my affection  therefore  Jack  if you would win my heart for ever  take her under your care  use her as she deserves  she would grace the arms of an emperor  and will do you honour  therefore be cautious in your recommendations  she is not for vulgar palates  nor will ever condescend to grant her favours but on very valuable considerations      Sir   answered the waiter    I take her at your recommendation  and will do as well by her as you can desire  I expect a constant customer of mine to morrow night  indeed  neither his purse nor appearance are adequate to   42 the desert of women of the first class in my list  He never gives more than two guineas  but then the girls tell me it is for doing nothing  besides  Sir Tho  S—and Col  D—gl—s are part of his company  They are good men  and worthy the favour of the ladies  I assure you  and if you approve of it  I ll introduce you  madam  to morrow night     Miss ELLIOT signified her consent by her silence  and the gamester by an hearty acknowledgment of the favour  after which  having finished the second bottle  they departed highly pleased with their future prospect of success   The next day means were concerted between them for procuring a proper dress for our heroine to appear in at night  after much study  to little purpose  Mr  C—rke proposed to pledge his watch  which would enable her to redeem her own  with other necessaries for the approaching scene     43Accordingly the money advanced  and what Mr  C—rke had besides  equipped Miss ELLIOT very elegantly  and raised their hopes of a very successful adventure  nor were they disappointed  for the lady wrought so effectually on the three old letchers  Sir Tho  S—  Col  D—gl—s  and lord R—hf—d  that an emulation was excited amongst them to obtain the ascendency in her favour  and each strove to excel in point of promises  As these old gentlemen were peculiar in their dispositions  a sketch of their characters may not be unacceptable   Sir Tho  S— was born to an immense fortune  but through an incessant devotion  during a considerable number of years  to Bacchus and Venus  the major part was exhausted  and at length  when his constitution would no longer admit of his criminal indulgencies  he sunk his last two thousand in the funds  which produced him an annuity of two hundred  but from his emaciated carcass  it was not to be supposed he could ever live to receive half the sum he had sunk     44Though he tottered at the age of forty five  a handsome woman would bring a glow on his cheeks  and cause him to exhibit the shameless picture of inordinate desire  combating with premature impotence  and cursing the former vehemence of his passion  which had brought on debility so long before its natural course  He was  in short  a composition of venery and ebriety  living but to gratify those appetites common to men and brutes  still coveting the company of the finest women merely to indulge the remembrance of his past excesses   Colonel D—gl—s was sanguine in his attachment to the fair sex  without suffering them to engross his attention
