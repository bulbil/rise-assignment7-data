O friendship  thou fond soother of the human breast  to thee we fly in every calamity  to thee the wretched seek for succour  on thee the care tired son of misery fondly relies  from thy kind assistance the unfortunate always hopes relief  and may be ever sure of——disappointment  My first application was to a city scrivener  who had frequently offered to lend me money when he knew I did not want it  I informed him  that now was the time to put his friendship to the test  that I wanted to borrow a couple of hundreds for a certain occasion  and was resolved to take it up from him  And pray  Sir  cried my friend  do you want all this money  Indeed I never wanted it more  returned I  I am sorry for that  cries the scrivener  with all my heart  for they who want money when they come to borrow  will always want money when they should come to pay   From him I flew with indignation to one of the best friends I had in the world  and made the same request  Indeed  Mr  Dry bone  cries my friend  I always thought it would come to this  You know  sir  I would not advise you but for your own good  but your conduct has hitherto been ridiculous in the highest degree  and some of your acquaintance always thought   109 you a very silly fellow  let me see  you want two hundred pounds  do you want only two hundred  sir  exactly  To confess a truth  returned I  I shall want three hundred  but then I have another friend from whom I can borrow the rest  Why then  replied my friend  if you would take my advice  and you know I should not presume to advise you but for your own good  I would recommend it to you to borrow the whole sum from that other friend  and then one note will serve for all  you know   Poverty now began to come fast upon me  yet instead of growing more provident or cautious as I grew poor  I became every day more indolent and simple  A friend was arrested for fifty pounds  I was unable to extricate him except by becoming his bail  When at liberty he fled from his creditors  and left me to take his place  In prison I expected greater satisfactions than I had enjoyed at large  I hoped to converse with men in this new world simple and believing like myself  but I found them as cunning and as cautious as those in the world I had left behind  They spunged up my money whilst it lasted  borrowed my coals and never paid them  and cheated me when I played at cribbage  All this was done because they believed me to be very good natured  and knew that I had no harm in me   Upon my first entrance into this mansion  which is to some the abode of despair  I felt no sensations different from those I experienced abroad  I was now on one side the door  and those who were unconfined were on the other  this was all the difference between us  At first   110 indeed I felt some uneasiness  in considering how I should be able to provide this week for the wants of the week ensuing  but after some time  if I found myself sure of eating one day  I never troubled my head how I was to be supplied another  I seized every precarious meal with the utmost good humour  indulged no rants of spleen at my situation  never called down heaven and all the stars to behold me dining upon an halfpenny worth of radishes  my very companions were taught to believe that I liked sallad better than mutton  I contented myself with thinking  that all my life I should either eat white bread or brown  considered that all that happened was best  laughed when I was not in pain  took the world as it went  and read Tacitus often  for want of more books and company   How long I might have continued in this torpid state of simplicity I cannot tell  had I not been rouzed by seeing an old acquaintance  whom I knew to be a prudent blockhead preferred to a place in the government  I now found that I had pursued a wrong track  and that the true way of being able to relieve others  was first to aim at independance myself  My immediate care  therefore  was to leave my present habitation  and make an entire reformation in my conduct and behaviour  For a free  open  undesigning deportment  I put on that of closeness  prudence and oeconomy  One of the most heroic actions I ever performed  and for which I shall praise myself as long as I live  was the refusing half a crown to an old acquaintance  at the time when he wanted it  and I had it to spare  for this alone I deserve to be decreed an ovation     111I now therefore pursued a course of uninterrupted frugality  seldom wanted a dinner  and was consequently invited to twenty  I soon began to get the character of a saving hunks that had money  and insensibly grew into esteem  Neighbours have asked my advice in the
