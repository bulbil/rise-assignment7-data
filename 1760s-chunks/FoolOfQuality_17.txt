complain of our author s incoherence   and lack of constructive skill   Books like The Fool of   Quality are not to be placed in the same category as the   ordinary stereotyped novel  They belong to that class of   book which we read in  but do not read through  at least    not at a sitting  Rather we should dip into them  jump   lightly from chapter to chapter   pick out an episode here    and a pretty anecdote there   ransack them for pithy   apologues  and tales of heroism nobly told  Taken in this   way  the book has in it much that is great  Parts  I submit    of The Fool of Quality are truly in the grand style  Story    character and thought are  in many passages  wrought into   a perfect harmony  and inspired with an admirable wisdom    a genuine humour  and a noble ardour of feeling that makes   the reader s heart glow with responsive passion      Among passages that may be singled out as equally fine   in manner and in matter  are such things as the fable of the   Three Trouts  and the old story retold of Damon aud   Pythias   Brooke s skill in rehandling an old and hackneyed   tale  and endowing it with a new freshness and power  of   itself marks him out as a writer  In his new version of the   prophet Esdras  he catches something of the poetic spirit   of the Biblical writers  as well as the magnificence of diction   and the stately rhythm of their English translators      If he cries war  it is war   the banners of blood are let loose to the   wind  and the sound of the clarion kindles all men to battle  His         INTRODUCTION xxxi     hosts clothe themselves in harness  and range in terrible array   and his   horses begin to neigh and tear up the ground  and his chariots to roll   as distant thunders  They move and cover the earth wide as the eye   can reach  The forests are laid flat  the mountains shake beneath them    and neither the rocks nor the rivers impede the march of his armies    They trample into dust the fruits of the field  and the labours of the   industrious   houses  vineyards and standing corn   the villages and   towns smoke on every side      But the gem of the book  or is it only the piece that I   re read last    is the story from Froissart of the surrender   of Calais  and Queen Philippa s intercession for the   burghers   let me quote a few sentences therefrom       As soon as they had reached the presence Mauny  says the monarch    are these the principal inhabitants of Calais   They are  says Mauny     they are not only the principal men of Calais  they are the principal   men of France  my lord  if virtue has any share in the act of ennobling    Were they delivered peaceably   says Edward   was there no resist    ance  no commotion among the people  Not in the least  my lord     the people would all have perished rather than have delivered the least   of these to your majesty  They are self delivered  self devoted  and   come to offer up their inestimable heads as an ample equivalent for the   ransom of thousands      That is the right epic note  The author himself   anticipates the objections of those who think we may have   too much even of a good book   Sir   he says   a book   may be compared to the life of your neighbour  If it be   good it cannot last too long   if bad  you cannot get rid of   it too early       ERNEST A  BAKER          BIBLIOGRAPHY OF HENRY BROOKE         Universal Beauty   a philosophical poem in six books  1735      A Translation of the first three books of Tasso  1737      Gustavus Vasa   the Deliverer of his country   a tragedy    Intended to have been acted at Drury Lane  1739      Constantia   or  the Man of Law s Tale  in Ogle s Canterbury   Tales Modernised   1741      Prospectus of a work to be entitled  Ogygian Tales   or a   curious collection of Irish Fables  Allegories and Histories    from the relations of Fintane the Aged  for the entertain    ment of Cathal Grove Darg  during that Prince s abode in   the Island of O Brazil  1743
