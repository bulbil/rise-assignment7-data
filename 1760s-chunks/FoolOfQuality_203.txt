  clearer than at noonday  by the light which she cast with profusion   abroad  Every feature and former trace seemed heightened into a   lustre  without a loss of the least similitude  She smiled ineffable   sweetness and blessedness upon me   and  stooping down  I felt her   embrace about my heart and about my spirit   while  at the same   time  I saw her bent in complacence before me  After a length of   ecstatic pleasure  which I felt from her communion and infusion into   my soul My Harry  says she  grieve not for me   All the delights   that your world could sum up in an age  would not amount to my   bliss  no  not for an hour   it is a weight of enjoyment that  in an   instant  would crush to nothing the whole frame of your mortality    Grieve not then for me  my Harry  but resign my beggarly spoils to   their beggarly parent   ashes to ashes  and dust to dust   In my   inordinate fondness for you  I have at length obtained a promise   that my master and your master  my beloved and your lover  shall   finally bear you triumphant through all the enemies that are set in   fearful array against you  Having so said  I felt myself  as it were    compressed within an engine of love   and again losing the remem    brance of all that had passed  I sunk as into a state of oblivion    Toward the dawning  I was awakened by the clapping of hands and   cries of lamentation  Starting up  I perceived Mr  Golding at the   bedside  suspended over his Matty and me  and pouring forth his   complaints      There was a favoured domestic of his  a little old man  who had   always kept a careful and inquisitive eye over every thing that was   in or concerned our household  This Argus  it seems  at length   suspected my nightly visits to the dead  and  lurking in a corner    saw me open and enter the chamber where the corpse was de    posited  As he lay in his master s apartment  he took the first   opportunity of his being awake to impart what he thought a matter   of extraordinary intelligence to him  Sir  says he  if I am not   greatly deceived  my young master is this moment in bed with his   dead lady  What is this you tell me  cried Mr  Golding  No    John  no  what you say is impossible  All who live  love that   which is living alone   whatever savours of death is detestable to   all men  As I am here  replied John  I am almost assured that   what I tell you is fact  Peace  peace  you old fool  said Mr    Golding  think you that our Harry is more loving than father   Abraham  and yet Abraham desired to bury his dead out of his   sight  I know not how that may be  said trusty John   but  if you   are able to stir  I will help you to go and see  I am sure the   thought of it melts the very heart within me      Accordingly Mr  Golding  like old Jacob  strengthened himself    and arose  and  pained as he was  he came with the help of his John   to the place where I lay      Having for some time looked upon me  as I slept with his Matty   fast folded in my arms  he could no longer contain his emotions    but he and John broke forth into tears and exclamations  O my   children  my children  my dearest children   he cried   why did ye   exalt me to such a pitch of blessedness   Was it only to cast me   down into the deeper gulf of misery a gulf that has neither bank   nor bottom          208 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      As I arose  all ashamed to be detected in that manner  the good   man caught me in his arms  My Harry  my Harry  says he  what   shall I pay you  my son  for your superabundant love to me and   to mine   Could my wretchedness give you bliss  I should almost   think myself blessed in being wretched  my Harry      I now prepared to execute the late comman l of my angel  and   to consign to earth the little that was earthly in her  But when   our domestics understood that all that was left of their loved mis    tress was now going to be taken away from them for ever  they   broke into tears anew
