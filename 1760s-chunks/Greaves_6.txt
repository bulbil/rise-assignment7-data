talking—these two old piratical— had held a palaver with a lawyer—an attorney  Tom  d ye mind me  an attorney—and by his assistance hove me out of my inheritance  That is all  brother—hove me out of five hundred pounds a year—that s all—what signifies—but such windfalls we don t every day pick up along shore  Fill about  brother—yes  by the L—d  those two smuggling harridans  with the assistance of an attorney—an attorney  Tom—hove me out of five hundred a year    Yes  indeed  sir   added Mr  Clarke   those two malicious old women docked the intail  and left the estate to an alien    Here Mr  Ferret thought proper to intermingle in the conversation with a  Pish  what dost talk of docking the intail  Dost not know that by the statute Westm  2  13 Ed  the will and intention of the donor must be fulfilled  and the tenant in tail shall not alien after issue had  or before    Give me leave  sir   replied Tom   I presume you are a practitioner in the law  Now  you know  that in the case of a contingent remainder  the intail may be destroyed by levying a fine  and suffering a recovery  or otherwise destroying the particular estate  before the contingency happens  If feoffees  who possess an estate only during the life of a son  where divers remainders are limited over  make a feoffment in fee to him  by the feoffment  all the future remainders are destroyed  Indeed  a person in remainder may have a writ of intrusion  if any do intrude after the death of a tenant for life  and the writ ex gravi querela lies to execute a device in remainder after the death of a tenant in tail without issue    Spoke like a true disciple of Geber   cries Ferret   No  sir   replied Mr  Clarke   Counsellor Caper is in the conveyancing way—I was clerk to Serjeant Croker    Ay  now you may set up for yourself   resumed the other   for you can prate as unintelligibly as the best of them     Perhaps   said Tom   I do not make myself understood  if so be as how that is the case  let us change the position  and suppose that this here case is a tail after a possibility of issue extinct  If a tenant in tail after a possibility make a feoffment of his land  he in reversion may enter for the forfeiture  Then we must make a distinction between general tail and special tail  It is the word body that makes the intail  there must be a body in the tail  devised to heirs male or female  otherwise it is a fee simple  because it is not limited of what body  Thus a corporation cannot be seized in tail  For example  here is a young woman—What is your name  my dear    Dolly   answered the daughter  with a curtsey   Here s Dolly—I seize Dolly in tail—Dolly  I seize you in tail — Sha t then   cried Dolly  pouting   I am seized of land in fee—I settle on Dolly in tail    Dolly  who did not comprehend the nature of the illustration  understood him in a literal sense  and  in a whimpering tone  exclaimed   Sha t then  I tell thee  cursed tuoad   Tom  however  was so transported with his subject  that he took no notice of poor Dolly s mistake  but proceeded in his harangue upon the different kinds of tails  remainders  and seisins  when he was interrupted by a noise that alarmed the whole company  The rain had been succeeded by a storm of wind that howled around the house with the most savage impetuosity  and the heavens were overcast in such a manner that not one star appeared  so that all without was darkness and uproar  This aggravated the horror of divers loud screams  which even the noise of the blast could not exclude from the ears of our astonished travellers  Captain Crowe called out   Avast  avast   Tom Clarke sat silent  staring wildly  with his mouth still open  the surgeon himself seemed startled  and Ferret s countenance betrayed evident marks of confusion  The ostler moved nearer the chimney  and the good woman of the house  with her two daughters  crept closer to the company   After some pause  the captain starting up   These   said he   be signals of distress  Some poor souls in danger of foundering—let us bear up a head  and see if we can give them any assistance   The landlady begged him  for Christ s sake  not to think of going out  for it was a spirit that would lead him astray into fens and rivers  and certainly do him a mischief  Crowe seemed to be staggered by this remonstrance  which his nephew reinforced  observing  that it might be a stratagem of rogues to decoy them into the fields  that they might rob them under the cloud of night  Thus exhorted  he resumed his seat  and Mr  Ferret began to make very severe strictures upon the folly
