 Goodman s at   this time  he sat like one transfixed with thunder  and was wholly   incapable of uttering one syllable  He appeared to the company as lost   in thought  but was  indeed  almost past the power of thinking  till his   lawyer roused him with these words   Come  Sir   said he   you see how   the case stands  there is no time to be lost  you must either pay the   money down  or get immediate security  for I suppose you would not chuse   to lie here to night   This seasonable admonition brought him a little to   himself  he now began to reflect on what it would best become him to do    and  after a pause of some moments   I believe   said he   that I have   now in my house more than the sum in bills that would discharge this   bond  but I would willingly hear what this woman has to say before I pay   the money  and will therefore give in bail   Accordingly  he sent for   two citizens of great worth and credit  to desire them to come to him    they instantly complied with this summons  and the whole affair being   repeated to them  voluntarily offered to be his sureties       Bail bonds were easily procured  but it took up some time in filling   them up  and discharging the fees  and other consequential expences  so   that it was past one o clock before all was over  and Mr  Goodman had   liberty to return to his own habitation       It was very seldom that Mr  Goodman staid late abroad  but whenever any   thing happened that obliged him to do so  Lady Mellasin  through the   great affection she pretended to have for him  would never go to bed   till his return  Mrs  Prinks for the most part was her sole companion in   such cases  but it so fell out  that this night neither of the two young   ladies had any inclination to sleep  Miss Flora s head was full of the   above mentioned plot  and the anxiety for it s success  the remembrance   of the last adventure at Miss Forward s was not yet quite dissipated in   Miss Betsy  the coldness with which she imagined herself treated by her   elder brother  with whom she had flattered herself of living  and being   very happy under his protection  gave her a good deal of uneasiness  To   add to all these matters of disquiet  she had also received that   afternoon a letter from Mr  Francis Thoughtless  acquainting her  that   he had the misfortune to be so much bruised by a fall he got from his   horse  that it was utterly impossible for him to travel  and she must   not expect him in town yet for some days       The ladies were all together  sitting in the parlour  each chusing   rather to indulge her own private meditations  than to hold discourse   with the others  when Mr  Goodman came home  Lady Mellasin ran to   embrace him with a shew of the greatest tenderness   My dear Mr    Goodman   cried she   how much I have suffered from my fear lest some   ill accident should have befallen you     The worst that could have   happened has befallen me   replied he  thrusting her from him   yet no   more than what you might very reasonably expect would one day or another   happen     What do you mean  my dear   said she  more alarmed at his   words and looks than she made shew of   You may too easily inform   yourself what it is I mean   cried he  hastily   on the retrospect of   your behaviour  I now find  but too late  how much I have been imposed   upon  Did you not assure me   continued he  somewhat more mildly   that   you were free from all incumbrances but that girl  whom  since our   marriage  I have tendered as my own   And then perceiving she answered   nothing  but looked pale  and trembled  he repeated to her the affront   he had received   Which   said he   in all my dealings in the world    would never have happened  but on your account        Though Lady Mellasin had as much artifice  and the power of   dissimulation  as any of her sex  yet she was at a loss thus taken   unprepared  She hesitated  she stammered  and fain would have denied the   having given any such bond  but  finding the proofs too plain against   her  she threw herself at his feet  wept  and conjured him to forgive
