affections  and amused themselves with little  intrigues  which  in the opinion of a man of pleasure  do not affect his  fidelity to the acknowledged sovereign of his soul   In the midst of these amusements  our hero received an intimation from  his sister  that she should be overjoyed to meet him next day  at five  o clock in the afternoon  at the house of her nurse  who lived in a  cottage hard by her father s habitation  she being debarred from all  opportunity of seeing him in any other place by the severity of her  mother  who suspected her inclination  He accordingly obeyed the  summons  and went at the time appointed to the place of rendezvous   where he met this affectionate young lady  who when he entered the room   ran towards him with all the eagerness of transport  flung her arms  about his neck  and shed a flood of tears in his bosom before she  could utter one word  except a repetition of My dear  dear brother  He  embraced her with all the piety of fraternal tenderness  wept over her  in his turn  assured her that this was one of the happiest moments of  his life  and kindly thanked her for having resisted the example  and  disobeyed the injunctions  of his mother s unnatural aversion   He was ravished to find  by her conversation  that she possessed a  great share of sensibility and prudent reflection  for she lamented the  infatuation of her parents with the most filial regret  and expressed  such abhorrence and concern at the villainous disposition of her younger  brother as a humane sister may be supposed to have entertained  He made  her acquainted with all the circumstances of his own fortune  and  as he  supposed she spent her time very disagreeably at home  among characters  which must be shockingly interesting  professed a desire of removing her  into some other sphere  where she could live with more tranquility and  satisfaction   She objected to this proposal as an expedient that would infallibly  subject her to the implacable resentment of her mother  whose favour and    6 22 15  3 45 PM   affection she at present enjoyed but in a very inconsiderable degree   and they had canvassed divers schemes of corresponding for the future   when the voice of Mrs  Pickle was heard at the door  Miss Julia  that  was the young lady s name   finding herself betrayed  was seized with  a violent agitation of fear  and Peregrine scarce had time to encourage  her with a promise of protection  before the door of the apartment being  flung open  this irreconcilable parent rushed in  and  with a furious  aspect  flew directly at her trembling daughter  when  the son  interposing  received the first discharge of her fury   Her eyes gleamed with all the rage of indignation  which choked up her  utterance  and seemed to convulse her whole frame  she twisted her left  hand in his hair  and with the other buffeted him about the face till  the blood gushed from his nostrils and mouth  while he defended his  sister from the cruelty of Gam  who assaulted her from another quarter   seeing his brother engaged  This attack lasted several minutes with  great violence  till at length Peregrine  finding himself in danger of  being overpowered if he should remain any longer on the defensive  laid  his brother on his back  then he disentangled his mother s hand from his  own hair  and  having pushed her gently out of the room  bolted the door  on the inside  finally  turning to Gam  he threw him out at the window   among a parcel of hogs that fed under it  By this time Julia was almost  quite distracted with terror  she knew she had offended beyond all hope  of forgiveness  and from that moment considered herself as an exile from  her father s house  in vain did her brother strive to console her  with fresh protestations of love and protection  she counted herself  extremely miserable in being obliged to endure the eternal resentment  of a parent with whom she had hitherto lived  and dreaded the censure of  the world  which  from her mother s misrepresentation  she was sensible  would condemn her unheard  That she might not  however  neglect any  means in her power of averting this storm  she resolved to appease  if  possible  her mother s wrath with humiliation  and even appeal to the  influence of her father  weak as it was  before she would despair  of being forgiven  But the good lady spared her this unnecessary  application  by telling her  through the keyhole  that she must never  expect to come within her father s door again  for  from that hour  she  renounced her as unworthy of her affection and regard  Julia  weeping  bitterly  endeavoured to soften the rigour of this sentence by the most  submissive and reasonable remonstrances  but as  in her vindication  she  of necessity espoused her elder brother s cause  her endeavours  instead  of soothing
