            CHAPTER TWENTY ONE  CONTAINING FURTHER ANECDOTES RELATING TO THE CHILDREN ON WRETCHEDNESS   Dinner being cheerfully discussed  and our adventurer expressing an eager desire to know the history of the male and female who had acted as squires or seconds to the champions of the King s Bench  Felton gratified his curiosity to this effect    All that I know of Captain Clewline  previous to his commitment  is  that he was a commander of a sloop of war  and bore the reputation of a gallant officer  that he married the daughter of a rich merchant in the city of London  against the inclination and without the knowledge of her father  who renounced her for this act of disobedience  that the captain consoled himself for the rigour of the parent  with the possession of the lady  who was not only remarkably beautiful in person  but highly accomplished in her mind  and amiable in her disposition  Such  a few months ago  were those two persons whom you saw acting in such a vulgar capacity  When they first entered the prison  they were undoubtedly the handsomest couple mine eyes ever beheld  and their appearance won universal respect even from the most brutal inhabitants of the jail    The captain  having unwarily involved himself as a security for a man to whom he had lain under obligations  became liable for a considerable sum  and his own father in law being the sole creditor of the bankrupt  took this opportunity of wreaking vengeance upon him for having espoused his daughter  He watched an opportunity until the captain had actually stepped into the post chaise with his lady for Portsmouth  where his ship lay  and caused him to be arrested in the most public and shameful manner  Mrs  Clewline had like to have sunk under the first transports of her grief and mortification  but these subsiding  she had recourse to personal solicitation  She went with her only child in her arms  a lovely boy  to her father s door  and  being denied admittance  kneeled down in the street  imploring his compassion in the most pathetic strain  but this hard hearted citizen  instead of recognising his child  and taking the poor mourner to his bosom  insulted her from the window with the most bitter reproach  saying  among other shocking expressions   Strumpet  take yourself away with your brat  otherwise I shall send for the beadle  and have you to Bridewell     The unfortunate lady was cut to the heart by this usage  and fainted in the street  from whence she was conveyed to a public house by the charity of some passengers  She afterwards attempted to soften the barbarity of her father by repeated letters  and by interesting some of his friends to intercede with him in her behalf  but all her endeavours proving ineffectual  she accompanied her husband to the prison of the King s Bench  where she must have felt  in the severest manner  the fatal reverse of circumstance to which she was exposed    The captain being disabled from going to sea  was superseded  and he saw all his hopes blasted in the midst of an active war  at a time when he had the fairest prospects of fame and fortune  He saw himself reduced to extreme poverty  cooped up with the tender partner of his heart in a wretched hovel  amidst the refuse of mankind  and on the brink of wanting the common necessaries of life  The mind of man is ever ingenious in finding resources  He comforted his lady with vain hopes of having friends who would effect his deliverance  and repeated assurances of this kind so long  that he at length began to think they were not altogether void of foundation    Mrs  Clewline  from a principle of duty  recollected all her fortitude  that she might not only bear her fate with patience  but even contribute to alleviate the woes of her husband  whom her affection had ruined  She affected to believe the suggestions of his pretended hope  she interchanged with him assurances of better fortune  her appearance exhibited a calm  while her heart was torn with anguish  She assisted him in writing letters to former friends  the last consolation of the wretched prisoner  she delivered these letters with her own hand  and underwent a thousand mortifying repulses  the most shocking circumstances of which she concealed from her husband  She performed all the menial offices in her own little family  which was maintained by pawning her apparel  and both the husband and wife  in some measure  sweetened their cares by prattling and toying with their charming little boy  on whom they doated with an enthusiasm of fondness  Yet even this pleasure was mingled with the most tender and melancholy regret  I have seen the mother hang over him  with the most affecting expression of this kind in her aspect  the tears contending with the smiles upon her countenance  while she exclaimed   Alas  my poor prisoner  little did your mother once think she should be obliged to nurse you in a jail   The captain s paternal love was dashed with impatience  he would snatch up the boy in a transport of grief  press him to his breast  devour him as it were with kisses
