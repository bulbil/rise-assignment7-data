all the   honourable services in my power to do you while you continue here  how   much my words are deficient to denote my meaning       Louisa  now finding herself under a necessity of answering seriously    told him  that if it were true that he had sentiments for her of the   nature he pretended  they would not only merit  but receive the most   grateful acknowledgments on her part  but at the same time she should be   sorry he had entertained them  and would wish him not to indulge a   prospect which could last no longer than while both remained in Venice    and must infallibly vanish on their separation       No  madam  replied he  when the next campaign is over  I shall return to   France  and sure the distance between that kingdom and England is not so   great  but a less motive than yourself would easily carry me thither    and such credentials also of who  and what I am  as  I flatter myself    would not appear contemptible in the eyes of your friends   the prospect   therefore is not so visionary as you seem to think  provided I have   your consent       The mention he made of her friends reminding her of her destitute   condition  gave her the utmost shock  which not being able to overcome    she remained silent some moments  but at last perceiving he waited her   reply  monsieur  said she  there may be a thousand indissoluble bars   between us which you do not think of       None  interrupted he eagerly  but what such love as mine will easily   surmount   it is true  I am ignorant of your condition in the world  but   if it be superior to mine  the passion I am possessed of will inspire me   with means to raise me to an equality  and if inferior  which heaven   grant may be the case  it will only give the opportunity of proving that   I love Louisa for Louisa s self  and look upon every thing she brings   beside as nothing       The emphasis he gave these words manifesting their sincerity  could not   but give new charms to the person who spoke them  Louisa thought she   might  without a blush  testify the sense she had of his generosity  but   tho  what she said was perfectly obliging to him  yet she concluded with   letting him know  there still was something that rendered the   accomplishment of what he seemed to wish impossible       Then your heart already is engaged  cried he  or you are predestined by   your parents to some happier man  Without either of these  answered she    there may be reasons to prevent our ever meeting more   therefore I owe   so much to the honourable offers you are pleased to make me  as to wish   you to overcome whatever inclinations you may have for one who I once   more assure you never can be yours       It would be impossible to express the distraction monsieur du Plessis   testified at this expression   a thousand times over did he repeat that   dreadful word NEVER   then added  neither engaged by love or promise    yet never can be mine  does my ill fate come wrap d to me in   riddles   yet many things have seemed impossible that are not so in   themselves   O Louisa  continued he  if there be any thing beside my   want of merit that impedes my wishes  and you delight not in my torment    speak it I conjure you       There is a necessity of denying you in this also  said Louisa  but to   shew you how little I am inclined to be ungrateful  be certain that I   have the highest idea of your merits  and prize them as much as I   ought to do       These last words  obliging as they were  could not console monsieur du   Plessis for the cruelty  as he termed it  of refusing to let him know   what this invincible obstacle was which put a stop to any further   correspondence between them  he spared neither prayers nor tears to draw   the secret from her  but all were ineffectual  and she at last told him    that if he pressed her any farther on that head  she must for the future   avoid his presence       This was a menace which he had not courage to dare the execution of  and   he promised to conform to her will  tho  with such agonies  as shewed   her how much he valued even the little she was pleased to grant  but it   was not in the power of her perswasions to prevail on him to resolve to
