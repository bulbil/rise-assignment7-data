what beast a will get into next    Probably into a mule   said the knight   in that case  you will be in some danger—but I can  at any time  dispossess you with a horse whip  — Ay  ay   answered Timothy   your honour has a mortal good hand at giving a flap with a fox s tail  as the saying is— t is a wonderment you did not try your hand on that there wiseacre that stole your honour s harness  and wants to be an arrant with a murrain to  un  Lord help his fool s head  it becomes him as a sow doth a cart saddle    There is no guilt in infirmity   said the knight   I punish the vicious only    I would your honour would punish Gilbert then   cried the squire   for  t is the most vicious tuoad that ever I laid a leg over—but as to that same seafaring man  what may his distemper be     Madness   answered Sir Launcelot   Bodikins   exclaimed the squire   I doubt as how other volks are leame of the same leg—but it an t vor such small gentry as he to be mad  they mun leave that to their betters    You seem to hint at me  Crabshaw  Do you really think I am mad    I may say as how I have looked your honour in the mouth  and a sorry dog should I be  if I did not know your humours as well as I know e er a beast in the steable at Greavesbury Hall    Since you are so well acquainted with my madness   said the knight   what opinion have you of yourself  who serve and follow a lunatic    I hope I han t served your honour for nothing  but I shall inherit some of your cast vagaries—when your honour is pleased to be mad  I should be very sorry to be found right in my senses  Timothy Crabshaw will never eat the bread of unthankfulness—it shall never be said of him  that he was wiser than his measter  As for the matter of following a madman  we may see your honour s face is made of a fiddle  every one that looks on you  loves you   This compliment the knight returned  by saying   If my face is a fiddle  Crabshaw  your tongue is a fiddlestick that plays upon it—yet your music is very disagreeable—you don t keep time    Nor you neither  measter   cried Timothy   or we shouldn t be here wandering about under a cloud of night  like sheep stealers  or evil spirits with troubled consciences    Here the discourse was interrupted by a sudden disaster  in consequence of which  the squire uttered an inarticulate roar  that startled the knight himself  who was very little subject to the sensation of fear  But his surprise was changed into vexation  when he perceived Gilbert without a rider passing by  and kicking his heels with great agility  He forthwith turned his steed  and riding back a few paces  found Crabshaw rising from the ground  When he asked what was become of his horse  he answered in a whimpering tone   Horse  would I could once see him fairly carrion for the hounds—for my part  I believe as how  t is no horse  but a devil incarnate  and yet I ve been worse mounted  that I have—I d like to have rid a horse that was foaled of an acorn    This accident happened in a hollow way  overshadowed with trees  one of which the storm had blown down  so that it lay over the road  and one of its boughs projecting horizontally  encountered the squire as he trotted along in the dark  Chancing to hitch under his long chin  he could not disengage himself  but hung suspended like a flitch of bacon  while Gilbert  pushing forward  left him dangling  and  by his awkward gambols  seemed to be pleased with the joke  This capricious animal was not retaken  without the personal endeavours of the knight  for Crabshaw absolutely refusing to budge a foot from his honour s side  he was obliged to alight  and fasten Bronzomarte to a tree  Then they set out together  and  with some difficulty  found Gilbert with his neck stretched over a five barred gate  snuffing up the morning air  The squire  however  was not remounted  without first having undergone a severe reprehension from his master  who upbraided him with his cowardice  threatened to chastise him on the spot  and declared that he would divorce his dastardly soul from his body  should he ever be incommoded or affronted with another instance of his baseborn apprehension   Though there was some risk in carrying on the altercation at this juncture  Timothy  having bound up his jaws  could not withstand the inclination he had to confute his master  He therefore  in a muttering accent  protested  that  if the knight would give him leave  he should prove that his honour had tied a knot with his tongue  which he could not untie with all his teeth   How  caitiff   cried
