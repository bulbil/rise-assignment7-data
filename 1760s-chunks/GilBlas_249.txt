 but that  fortunately for them  they lodged with a kind  hearted widow  who boarded them on tick  at the rate of a hundred pistoles a year for each These anecdotes of a court life  not one of which escaped me  completely ventilated all the rising fumes of pride  It could not be supposed that more consideration would be shewn to me than to others  and consequently there was nothing to be so puffed up with in my post  there seemed to be much cry and little wool  a discovery which rendered it expedient to husband my finances with a narrower economy  A picture like this was enough to cure my taste for treating  I repented not having left these secretaries to find their own supper  for they played a most cruel knife and fork at mine  and  when the bill was brought  I squabbled with the landlord about the charges   We parted at midnight  and the early breaking up was to be laid at my door  for I did not propose another bottle  They went home to their widow  and I withdrew to my magnificent lodgings  which I was now mad with myself for having taken  and was fully determined to give up at the month s end  My bed of down was now converted into a couch of thorns  sleep had abandoned his narcotic tenement  and sold the fee simple of my repose to the demon of eternal wakefulness  The remainder of the night was passed in contriving not to serve the state too patriotically  For that purpose I bethought me of Monteser s good counsel  I got up with the intention of making my bow to Don Rodrigo de Calderona  My present temper was just pat to the purpose of ingratiating myself with so high and mighty a gentleman  whose patronage was indispensable to my existence  I therefore presented my person in that secretary s ante chamber   His apartments communicated with the duke s  and rivalled them in the lustre of their decorations  The field officer could scarcely be distinguished from the subaltern by any outward distinction in his paraphernalia  I sent in my name as Don Valerio s successor  but that did not hinder me from being kept kicking my heels for a good hour  Trusty  but novice officer of the king  said I  while ruminating on court manners  lean a lesson of patience  if so please you  You must begin with shewing paces yourself  and afterwards make others bite the bridle   At length the door of the inner room opened  I went in  and advanced towards Don Rodrigo  who had just been writing an amorous epistle to his charming Siren  and was giving it to Pedrillo at that very moment  I had never manufactured my face and air into such a counterfeit of reverence before the Archbishop of Grenada  nor on my introduction to the Count de Galiano  nor even in presence of the prime minister himself  the crisis of my fawning was reserved for Signor de Calderona  I paid my respects to him with my body bent down to the very ground  as if crouching under the ken of a superior intelligence  and solicited his protection in strains of humble hypocrisy  at which my cheek now burns with shame  to think that man can so debase himself before his fellow man  My servility would have recoiled to my own undoing  had it been practised towards a compound of any manly and independent ingredients  As for this fellow  he swallowed flattery by the lump without mastication  and assured me  just as if he meant what he said  that he would leave no stone unturned to do me service   Hereupon  thanking him with unlimited expressions of attachment for his kind and generous sentiments  I sold my very soul and all my little stock of conscience to his free disposal  But as this farce might be tiresome if prolonged  I took my leave  apologizing for having broken in upon his more serious avocations  As soon as I had finished this abominable scene  I slunk back to my desk  where I finished my prescribed task  The duke was at my elbow the next morning  The end of my performance was not less to his mind than the beginning  and he praised it accordingly  This is extremely well indeed  Copy this abridgment in your best hand into the register of Catalonia  You shall not want employment of this kind  I had a very long conversation with his excellency  and was delighted at his mild and familiar deportment  What a contrast to Calderona  They might have sat to a painter for Pan and Apollo   To day I dined at a cheap ordinary  and sunk the secretary upon my messmates  till I should ascertain what solid profit might accrue from all my bows and scrapes  I had funds for three months  or thereabouts  That interval I allowed myself for casting my bread upon the waters  But as the shortest speculations are the safest  if my salary was not paid by that time  a long farewell to the court  its frippery  and its falsehood  Thus were my plans arranged  For two months I laboured hard and fast to stand well with Calderona  but his senses were so callous to all my assiduity  that it seemed labour in vain to build on so hopeless a foundation
