repine over much at their lot  since  possibly  if they have had no Lovers  or having had one  two  or three  have not found an husband  they have had rather a miss than a loss  as men go  And let me here add  that I think  as matters stand in this age  or indeed ever did stand  that those women who have joined with the men in their insolent ridicule of Old Maids ought never to be forgiven  No  tho  Miss Grandison should be one of the ridiculers  An Old Maid may be an odious character  if they will tell us  that the bad qualities of the persons  not the maiden State  are what they mean to expose  But then they must allow  that there are Old Maids of Twenty  and even that there are Widows and Wives of all ages and complexions  who  in the abusive sense of the words  are as much Old Maids  as the most particular of that class of females   But a word or two more concerning Mr  Grandison   He is about Thirty two  He has had the glory of ruining two or three women  Sir Charles has restored him to a sense of shame  All men  I hope  are born with it  which  a sew months ago  he had got above  And he does not now entertain ladies with instances of the frailty of individuals of their Sex  which many are too apt  encouragingly  to   12 smile at  when I am very much mistaken  if every woman would not find her account  if she wishes herself to be thought well of  in discouraging every reflection that may have a tendency to debase or expose the Sex in general  How can a man be suffered to boast of his vileness to one woman  in the presence of another  without a rebuke  that should put it to the proof  whether the boaster was  or was not  past blushing   Mr  Grandison is thought to have hurt his fortune  which was very considerable  by his free living  and an itch of gaming  to cure him of which  Sir Charles encourages him to give him his company at all opportunities  He certainly has understanding enough to know how to value the favour  for he owns to Miss Grandison  that he both loves and fears him  and now and then tells her  that he would give the world  if he had it  to be able to be just what Sir Charles is  Good God  at other times he has broke out  What an odious creature is a Rake  How I hate myself  when I contemplate the excellencies of this divine Brother of yours   I shall say nothing of Sir Charles in this place  You  I know  my Lucy  will admire me for my forbearance   Lady L  and Miss Grandison were the Graces of the Table  So lively  so sensible  so frank  so polite  so good humour d  what honour do they and their Brother reflect back on the memory of their mother  Lady Grandison  it seems  was an excellent woman  Sir Thomas was not  I have heard  quite unexceptionable  How useful  if so  are the women in the greater  as well as in the lesser parts of domestic duty  where they perform their duty  And what have those  who do not  to answer for  to GOD  to their Children  and even to their whole Sex  for the contempts they bring upon it by their uselesness  and   13 perhaps extravagance  since  if the human mind is not actively good  it will generally be actively evil   Dr  Bartlett I have already spoken of  How did he enliven the conversation  whenever he bore a part in it  So happy an elocution  so clear  so just  so solid his reasoning  I wish I could remember every word he said   Sir Charles observed to us  before we saw him  that he was not forward to speak  But  as I hinted  he threw the occasions in his way  on purpose to draw him out  And at such times  what he said was easy  free  and unaffected  And whenever a subject was concluded  he had done with it  His modesty  in short  made him always follow rather than lead a subject  as he very well might do  be it what it would   I was charmed with the Brachman s prayer  which he  occasionally  gave us on the antient Persians being talked of   Looking up to the rising Sun  which it was supposed they worshipped  these were the words of the Brachman      O THOU  meaning the ALMIGHTY  by whom Thou  meaning the Sun  art enlightened  illuminate my mind  that my actions may be agreeable to THY Will      And this I will think of  my Lucy  as often as my early hour  for the future  shall be irradiated by that glorious orb   Every body was pleased with Mr  and Mrs  Reeves  Their modesty  good sense  and amiable tempers
