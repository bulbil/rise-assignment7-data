 understand your ogling  but you must content yourself with a cook maid   sink me  I see you want to sit  These withered shanks of yours tremble  under their burden  but you must have a little patience  old Hirco   indeed you must  I intend to mortify you a little longer  curse me    The company was so tickled with this address  which was delivered with  much grimace and gesticulation  that they burst out into a loud fit  of laughter  which they fathered upon a monkey that was chained in the  room  and  when the peal was over  the wit renewed the attack in these  words   I suppose you are fool enough to think this mirth was occasioned  by Pug  Ay  there he is  you had best survey him  he is of your own  family  switch me  But the laugh was at your expense  and you ought  to thank Heaven for making you so ridiculous   While he uttered these  ingenious ejaculations  the old gentleman bowed alternately to him and  the monkey  that seemed to grin and chatter in imitation of the beau   and  with an arch solemnity of visage  pronounced   Gentlemen  as I have  not the honour to understand your compliments  they will be much better  bestowed on each other   So saying  he seated himself  and had the  satisfaction to see the laugh returned upon the aggressor  who remained  confounded and abashed  and in a few minutes left the room  muttering   as he retired   The old fellow grows scurrilous  stap my breath    While Peregrine wondered in silence at this extraordinary scene  the  lady of the house perceiving his surprise  gave him to understand  that  the ancient visitant was utterly bereft of the sense of hearing   that his name was Cadwallader Crabtree  his disposition altogether  misanthropical  and that he was admitted into company on account  of entertainment he afforded by his sarcastic observations  and the  pleasant mistakes to which he was subject from his infirmity  Nor did  our hero wait a long time for an illustration of this odd character   Every sentence he spoke was replete with gall  nor did his satire  consist in general reflections  but a series of remarks  which had been  made through the medium of a most whimsical peculiarity of opinion   Among those who were present at this assembly was a young officer  who  having  by dint of interest  obtained a seat in the lower house  thought  it incumbent upon him to talk of affairs of state  and accordingly  regaled the company with an account of a secret expedition which the  French were busied in preparing  assuring them that he had it from the  mouth of the minister  to whom it had been transmitted by one of his  agents abroad  In descanting upon the particulars of the armament     6 22 15  3 45 PM   he observed that they had twenty ships of the line ready manned and  victualled at Brest  which were destined for Toulon  where they would  be joined by as many more  and from thence proceed to the execution of  their scheme  which he imparted as a secret not fit to be divulged   This piece of intelligence being communicated to all the company except  Mr  Crabtree  who suffered by his loss of hearing  that cynic was soon  after accosted by a lady  who  by means of an artificial alphabet   formed by a certain conjunction and disposition of the fingers  asked if  he had heard any extraordinary news of late  Cadwallader  with his usual  complaisance  replied  that he supposed she took him for a courier or  spy  by teasing him eternally with that question  He then expatiated  upon the foolish curiosity of mankind  which  he said  must either  proceed from idleness or want of ideas  and repeated almost verbatim  the officer s information  a vague ridiculous report invented by some  ignorant coxcomb  who wanted to give himself airs of importance  and  believed only by those who were utterly unacquainted with the politics  and strength of the French nation   In confirmation of what he had advanced  he endeavoured to demonstrate  how impossible it must be for that people to fit out even the third part  of such a navy  so soon after the losses they had sustained during  the war  and confirmed his proof by asserting  that to his certain  knowledge  the harbours of Brest and Toulon could not at that time  produce a squadron of eight ships of the line  The member  who was  an utter stranger to this misanthrope  hearing his own asseverations  treated with such contempt  glowed with confusion and resentment   and  raising his voice  began to defend his own veracity  with great  eagerness and trepidation  mingling with his arguments many blustering  invectives  against the insolence and ill manners of his supposed  contradictor  who sat with the most mortifying composure of countenance   till the officer s patience was quite exhausted  and then  to the  manifest increase
