eye around in quest of some relief  and  unable to contain himself   exclaimed   D  n seize the fellow and his pouch too  I believe he has  sheered off  and left me here in the stays    Mrs  Grizzle  who could not help taking some notice of this  manifestation of chagrin  lamented her unhappy fate in being so  disagreeable to him  that he could not put up with her company for a few  moments without repining  and began in very tender terms to reproach him  with his inhumanity and indifference  To this expostulation he replied    Zounds  what would the woman have  Let the parson do his office when he  wool  here I am ready to be reeved in the matrimonial block  d ye see   and d   all nonsensical palaver   So saying  he retreated  leaving his  mistress not at all disobliged at his plain dealing  That same evening  the treaty of marriage was brought upon the carpet  and  by means of Mr   Pickle and the lieutenant  settled to the satisfaction of all parties   without the intervention of lawyers  whom Mr  Trunnion expressly  excluded from all share in the business  making that condition the  indispensable preliminary of the whole agreement  Things being brought  to this bearing  Mrs  Grizzle s heart dilated with joy  her health   which  by the bye  was never dangerously impaired  she recovered as if  by enchantment  and  a day being fixed for the nuptials  employed the  short period of her celibacy in choosing ornaments for the celebration  of her entrance into the married state   CHAPTER VIII   Preparations are made for the Commodore s Wedding  which is delayed by  an Accident that hurried him the Lord knows whither   The fame of this extraordinary conjunction spread all over the county     6 22 15  3 45 PM   and  on the day appointed for their spousals  the church was surrounded  by an inconceivable multitude  The commodore  to give a specimen of his  gallantry  by the advice of his friend Hatchway  resolved to appear on  horseback on the grand occasion  at the head of all his male attendants   whom he had rigged with the white shirts and black caps formerly  belonging to his barge s crew  and he bought a couple of hunters for the  accommodation of himself and his lieutenant  With this equipage  then   he set out from the garrison for the church  after having despatched a  messenger to apprise the bride that he and his company were mounted  She  got immediately into the coach  accompanied by her brother and his wife   and drove directly to the place of assignation  where several pews were  demolished  and divers persons almost pressed to death  by the eagerness  of the crowd that broke in to see the ceremony performed  Thus arrived  at the altar  and the priest in attendance  they waited a whole  half hour for the commodore  at whose slowness they began to be under  some apprehension  and accordingly dismissed a servant to quicken his  pace  The valet having ridden something more than a mile  espied the  whole troop disposed in a long field  crossing the road obliquely  and  headed by the bridegroom and his friend Hatchway  who  finding himself  hindered by a hedge from proceeding farther in the same direction  fired  a pistol  and stood over to the other side  making an obtuse angle with  the line of his former course  and the rest of the squadron followed his  example  keeping always in the rear of each other  like a flight of wild  geese   Surprised at this strange method of journeying  the messenger came up   and told the commodore that his lady and her company expected him in the  church  where they had tarried a considerable time  and were beginning  to be very uneasy at his delay  and therefore desired he would proceed  with more expedition  To this message Mr  Trunnion replied   Hark ye   brother  don t you see we make all possible speed  go back  and tell  those who sent you  that the wind has shifted since we weighed anchor   and that we are obliged to make very short trips in tacking  by reason  of the narrowness of the channel  and that as we be within six points  of the wind  they must make some allowance for variation and  leeway     Lord  sir   said the valet   what occasion have you to go  zig zag in that manner  Do but clap spurs to your horses  and ride  straight forward  and I ll engage yea shall be at the church porch  in less than a quarter of an hour    What  right in the wind s eye    answered the commodore   ahey  brother  where did you learn your  navigation  Hawser Trunnion is not to be taught at this time of day how  to lie his course  or keep his own reckoning  And as for you
