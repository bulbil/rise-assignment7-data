dropt down on one knee  I could not  for a few moments  tell what to do  or what to say to her  Her hands held up  her fine eyes supplicating—Pray  Sir  forgive me   Humour  humour the dear creature  Chevalier  said her mother  sobbing   Forgive you  madam —Forgive you  dear Lady  for what —You have not offended  You could not offend   I raised her  and  taking her hand  pressed it with my lips  Now  madam  forgive me—For this freedom forgive me   Page  25 O Sir  I have given you  I have given every body  trouble —I am an unhappy creature  and God and you are angry with me—And you will not say you forgive me   Humour her  Chevalier   I do  I do forgive you  most excellent of women   She hesitated a little  then turned round to Camilla  who stood at a distance  weeping  and running to her  cast herself into her arms  hiding her face in her bosom—Hide me  hide me  Camilla  What have I done —I have kneeled to a man —She put her arm under Camilla s  and hurried out of the room with her   Her mother seeing me in some consusion  Rejoice with me  Chevalier  said she  yet weeping  that we see  tho  her reason is imperfect  such happy symptoms  Our child will  I trust in God  he once more our own  And you will be the happy instrument of restoring her to us   The Marquis  and the Bishop  were informed of what had passed  They also rejoiced  in these further day breaks  as I may call them  of their Clementina s reason  accompanied with that delicacy  that never  in so innocent a mind  can be separated from it   You will observe  my dear Dr  Bartlett  that I only aim to give you an account of the greater and more visible changes that happen in the mind of this unhappy Lady  omitting those conversations between her and her friends  in which her situation varied but little from those before described  By this means  you will be able to trace the steps to that recovery of her reason  which we presume to hope will be the return to our fervent prayers  and humble endeavours   Page  26  LETTER IV  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  In Continuation   Bologna  June 13 24   THE Conte della Porretta  and the two young Lords Sebastiano and Juliano  came hither yesterday  to rejoice on the hopeful prospects before us   I thought I saw a little shiness and reserve sit upon the brow of the Marchioness  which I had not observed till the arrival of the Count  A complaisance that was too civil for friendship  for our friendship  I never permit a cloud to hang for one hour upon the brow of a friend  without examining into the reason of it  in hopes it may be in my power to dispel it  An abatement in the freedom of one I love  is a charge of unworthiness upon me  that I must endeavour to obviate the moment I suspect it  I desired a private audience of the good Lady   She favoured me with it at the first word  But as soon as I had opened my heart to her  she asked  If Father Marescotti  who loved me  she said  as if I were his own son  might be allowed to be present at our conversation  I was a little startled at the question  but answered  By all means   The Father was sent to  and came  Tender concern and reserve were both apparent in his countenance  This shewed that he was apprised of the occasion of the Marchioness s reserve  and expected to be called upon  or employed in the explanation  had I not demanded it   I repeated  before him  what I had said to the Marchioness  of the reserve that I had thought I saw since yesterday in one of the most benign countenances in the world   Chevalier  said she  if you think that every one of our family  as well those of Urbino and Naples  as Page  27 those of this place  do not love you as one of their own family  you do not do us justice   She then enumerated and exaggerated their obligations to me  I truly told her  that I could not do less than I had done  and answer it to my own heart   Leave us  replied she  to judge for ourselves on this subject  And  for God s sake  do not think us capable of ingratitude  We begin with pleasure to see the poor child after a course of sufferings and distresses  that few young creatures have gone thro   reviving to our hopes  She must in gratitude  in honour  in justice  be yours  if you require her of us  and upon the terms you have formerly proposed   I think so  said the Father   What can I say  proceeded she  We are all distressed  I am put upon a task that grieves me  Ease my heart
