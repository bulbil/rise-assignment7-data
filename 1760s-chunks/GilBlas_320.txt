be compared  than the torches in a Candlemas procession to a rushlight  There is for you  you little scoundrel  said he  take that  and learn to mind your business  Must I be eternally at your heels to remind you of what you are to do  Are your brains in your belly  and all your wits in your grinders  You are not a downright idiot  Then why not prevent my wants and anticipate my orders  After this experimental lecture  he went out for the day  leaving me in high dudgeon  at a reprimand so much in the manner of my friend the ostler  for such a trifle as not getting up his things for the wash   I could never learn what happened to him a short time after at a tennis court  but one evening he came home in a terrible heat  Scipio  said he  I am bent on going to Italy  and must embark the day after to morrow on board a vessel bound for Genoa  I have my reasons for making this little excursion  of course you will be glad to attend me  and to profit by so fine an opportunity of seeing the loveliest country on the face of the earth  My tongue gave consent  but with a salvo in my heart and a bargain with my revenge  to give him the slip just at the moment of embarkation  This was so delightful a scheme  that I could not help imparting it to a bully by profession  whom I met in the street  During my abode in Seville  I had picked up some awkward acquaintance  and this was one of the most ungainly  I told him how and why my ears had been boxed  and then communicated my project of running away from Don Abel just before the ship was to sail  begging to know what he thought of the plan   My bluff adviser puckered his eyebrows while he listened  and fiddled with his fingers about his whiskers  then  blaming my master very seriously  My little hero  said he  you are eternally disgraced  can never shew your face again  if you sit down quietly with so paltry a satisfaction as what you propose  To let Don Abel go off by himself  would be a poor revenge for wrongs like yours  the punishment should be proportioned to his crime  Let us fine him to the full amount of his purse and effects  which we will share like brothers after he is gone  Now it is to be noted  that though thieving fell in very naturally with the bent of my genius  the proposal rather startled me  as the robbery was upon a large scale for so young an apprentice   And yet the arch deceiver of my innocence found the means of working me up to the perpetration  so that the result of our enterprise was as follows  This glorious ruffian  a tall  brawny fellow  came in the evening about twilight to our lodging  I shewed my master s travelling trunk ready packed  and asked him whether he could carry so heavy a load upon his shoulders  So heavy as that  said he  shew me where a transfer of property is to be made in my favour  and I could run with Noah s ark to the top of Mount Ararat  To prove his words  he felt the trunk  flung it carelessly over his back  and scampered down stairs  I followed nimbly  and we had just got to the street door  when Don Abel  brought home in the nick of time by the ascendancy of his lucky stars  stood like an apparition  to appal our guilty souls   Whither are you going with that trunk  said he  I was so taken by surprise that my assurance failed me  and broad shoulders  finding that he had drawn a blank in the lottery  threw down his booty  and took to his heels  rather than be troubled for an explanation  Once more  whither are you going with that trunk  said my master  Sir  answered I  with all the honest simplicity of a criminal  pleading in arrest of judgment  I was going to put it on board the vessel  that we might have the less to do to  morrow  before we embark ourselves  Indeed  Then you know  retorted he  in what ship I have taken my passage  No  sir  replied I  but those who can talk Latin may always find their way to Rome  I should have inquired at the port  and somebody would have informed me  At this explanation  which left his opinion where it found it  he darted a furious glance at me  I thought for all the world  he was going to cuff me again about the head  Who ordered you  cried he  to take my trunk out of this house  You  your own self  said I  Can you possibly have forgotten how you rated me but a few days ago  Did you not tell me  with a flea in my ear  that you would have me prevent your wants  and do beforehand from my own head whatever your service might require  Now  not to be threshed a second time for want of forethought  I was seeing your trunk safe and soon enough
