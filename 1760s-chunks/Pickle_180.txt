struck dumb  with pleasure at his appearance  and  having made divers ineffectual  efforts to get up  at length discharged a volley of curses against his  own limbs  and held out his hand to his godson  who kissed it with great  respect   After he had finished his apostrophe to the gout  which was the daily  and hourly subject of his execrations   Well  my lad   said he   I  care not how soon I go to the bottom  now I behold thee safe in harbour  again  and yet I tell a d  d lie  I would I could keep afloat until I  should see a lusty boy of thy begetting  Odds my timbers  I love thee  so well  that I believe thou art the spawn of my own body  though I can  give no account of thy being put upon the stocks   Then  turning his  eyes upon Pipes  who by this time had penetrated into his apartment  and  addressed him with the usual salutation of  What cheer    Ahey   cried  he   are you there  you herring faced son of a sea calf  What a slippery  trick you played your old commander  But come  you dog  there s my fist   I forgive you  for the love you bear to my godson  Go  man your tackle   and hoist a cask of strong beer into the yard  knock out the bung  and  put a pump in it  for the use of all my servants and neighbours  and   d ye hear  let the patereroes be fired  and the garrison illuminated   as rejoicings for the safe arrival of your master  By the Lord  if I had  the use of these d  d shambling shanks  I would dance a hornpipe with  the best of you    The next object of his attention was Mr  Jolter  who was honoured with    6 22 15  3 45 PM   particular marks of distinction  and the repeated promise of enjoying  the living in his gift  as an acknowledgment of the care and discretion  with which he had superintended the education and morals of our hero   The governor was so affected by the generosity of his patron  that the  tears ran down his cheeks  while he expressed his gratitude  and the  infinite satisfaction he felt in contemplating the accomplishments of  his pupil   Meanwhile  Pipes did not neglect the orders he had received  The beer  was produced  the gates were thrown open for the admission of all  comers  the whole house was lighted up  and the patereroes were  discharged in repeated volleys  Such phenomena could not fail to attract  the notice of the neighbourhood  The club at Tunley s were astonished  at the report of the guns  which produced various conjectures among the  members of that sagacious society  The landlord observed  that  in all  likelihood  the commodore was visited by hobgoblins  and ordered the  guns to be fired in token of distress  as he had acted twenty years  before  when he was annoyed by the same grievance  The exciseman  with  a waggish sneer  expressed his apprehension of Trunnion s death   in consequence of which the patereroes might be discharged with an  equivocal intent  either as signals of his lady s sorrow or rejoicing   The attorney signified a suspicion of Hatchway s being married to Miss  Pickle  and that the firing and illuminations were in honour of the  nuptials  upon which Gamaliel discovered some faint signs of emotion   and  taking the pipe from his mouth  gave it as his opinion  that his  sister was brought to bed   While they were thus bewildered in the maze of their own imaginations   a company of countrymen  who sat drinking in the kitchen  and whose legs  were more ready than their invention  sallied out to know the meaning  of these exhibitions  Understanding that there was a butt of strong beer  abroach in the yard  to which they were invited by the servants  they  saved themselves the trouble and expense of returning to spend the  evening at the public house  and listed themselves under the banner of  Tom Pipes  who presided as director of this festival   The news of Peregrine s return being communicated to the parish  the  parson  and three or four neighbouring gentlemen  who were well wishers  to our hero  immediately repaired to the garrison  in order to pay their  compliments on this happy event  and were detained to supper  An elegant  entertainment was prepared by the direction of Miss Julia  who was an  excellent housewife  and the commodore was so invigorated with joy  that  he seemed to have renewed his age  Among those who honoured the occasion  with their presence  was Mr  Clover  the young gentleman that made his  addresses to Peregrine s sister  His heart was so big with his passion   that  while the rest of the company were engrossed by their cups   he seized an opportunity of our hero s being detached from
