my mistress established her at once in my good graces  And yet  in the course of a few days  I could not help suspecting that  though not dainty in her likings  she knew what passion was  and that a foul copy of gallantry delighted her more than the fairest conversation   One morning  during the mysteries of the toilette  there presented himself to my notice a little fellow of forty  forbidding in his aspect  more filthy if possible than Pedro de Moya the bookworm  and verging in no marketable measure towards deformity  He told me he wanted to speak with my lady marchioness  On whose business  quoth I  On my own  quoth he  somewhat snappishly  Tell her I am the gentleman          she will understand you          about whom she was talking yesterday with Donna Anna de Velasco  I went before him into my lady s apartment  and gave in his name  The marchioness all at once shrieked out her satisfaction  and ordered me to show him in  It was not courtesy enough to point to a chair  and bid him sit down  but the attendants  forsooth  her own maids about her person were to withdraw  so that the little hunchback  with better luck than falls to the lot of many a taller man  had the field entirely to himself  as lord paramount  As for the girls and myself  we could not help tittering a little at this uncouthly concerted duet  which lasted nearly an hour  when my patroness dismissed his little lordship  with such a profusion of farewells and God be with you s  as sufficiently evinced her thankfulness for the entertainment she had received   The conversation had  in fact  been so edifying  that in the afternoon she seized a private opportunity of whispering in my ear    Gil Blas  when the short gentleman comes again  you may shew him up the back stairs  there is no need of parading him along a line of staring servants  I did as I was ordered  When this epitome of humanity knocked at the door  and that hour was no further off than the next morning  we threaded all the bye passages to the place of assignation  I played the same modest part two or three times in the very innocence of my soul  without the most distant guess that the material system could form any part of their philosophy  But that hound like snuff at an ill construction  with which the devil has armed the noses of the most charitable  put me on the scent of a very whimsical game  and I concluded either that the marchioness had an odd taste  or that crookback courted her as proxy to a better man   Faith and troth  thought I  with all the impertinence of a hasty opinion  if my mistress really likes a handsome fellow behind the curtain  all is well  I forgive her her sins  but if she is stark mad for such a monkey as this  to say the truth  there will be little mercy for her on male or female tongues  But how foully did I defame my honoured patroness  The genius of magic had perched herself upon the little conjurer s protuberant shoulder  and his skill having been puffed off to the marchioness  who was just the right food for such jugglers and their tricks  she held private conferences with him  Under his tuition she was to command wealth and treasure  to build castles in the air  to remove from place to place in an instant  to reveal future events  to tell what is done in far countries  to call the dead out of their graves  and terrify the world with many miracles  Seriously  and to give him his deserts  the scoundrel lived on the folly of the public  and it has been confidently asserted  that ladies of fashion have not in all ages and countries been exempt from the credulity of their inferiors       CH  IX     An incident that parted Gil Blas and the Marchioness of Chaves  The subsequent destination of the former   FOR six months I lived with the Marchioness of Chaves  and  as it must be admitted  on the fat of the land  But fate  who thrusts footmen as well as heroes into the world  with herself tied about their necks  gave me a jog to be gone  and swore that I should stay no longer in that family or in Madrid  The adfsventure by which this decree was announced shall be the subject of the ensuing narrative   In my mistress s female squad there was a nymph named Portia  To say nothing of her youth and beauty  it was her meek demeanour and good repute that captivated me  who had yet to learn that none but the brave deserves the fair  The marchioness s secretary  as proud as a prime minister  and as jealous as the Grand Turk  was caught in the same trap as myself  No sooner did he cast an unlucky squint at my advances  than  without waiting to see how Portia might chance to fancy them  he determined pell  mell to have a tilt with me  To forward this ghostly enterprise  he
