 That this marriage would expose her to public ridicule  she professed to have considered  that scandal would be busy at her expense  in short  that she should pass for an old fool with an ambitious eye and a liquorish constitution  No matter for that  She was not to be awed from the career of her humour by quips and sentences  her only alarm was  lest I should either make sport of her intentions  or torment her more grievously by my aversion   Such  continued the knight  was the substance of the Marchioness s declaration  and I am the more astonished at it  because she is the most prudent and sensible woman in Cordova  wherefore I answered by expressing my surprise at her honouring me with the offer of her hand  since she had hitherto persisted in her resolution of remaining in a state of widowhood  To this she replied  that having a considerable fortune  it would give her pleasure to share it in her life time with a man of honour to whom she was attached  To all appearance then  rejoined I  you have made up your mind to take a lover s leap  Can you doubt about that  answered he  The Marchioness is immensely rich  with excellent qualities both of head and heart  It would be the extreme of folly and fastidiousness to let so advantageous a settlement slip through my fingers   I entirely approved my master s purpose of profiting by so fine an opportunity to make his fortune  and even advised him to bring the matter to a short issue  for fear of a change in the wind  Happily the lady had the business more at heart than myself  her orders were given so effectually  that the necessary forms and ceremonies were soon got over  When it became known in Cordova that the old Marchioness of Almenara was getting herself ready to be the bride of young Don Manriquez de Medrano  the wits began breaking their odd quirks and remnants in derision of the widow  but though she heard her own detractions  she did not put them to mending  the town might talk as they pleased  for when she said she would die a widow  she did not think to live till she were married  The wedding was solemnized with a publicity and splendour which furnished fresh food for evil tongues  The bride  said they  might at least have had the modesty to dispense with noise and ostentation  so unbecoming in an old widow who marries a young husband   The Marchioness  far enough from yielding to the suggestions of shame at her own inconsistency  or the disparity of their ages  yielded herself up without constraint to the expression of the most lively joy  She gave a grand concert and supper  with a ball afterwards  and invited all the principal families in Cordova  Just before the close of the ball  the new married couple disappeared  and were shewn to an apartment  where  with no other witnesses but her own maid and myself she spoke to my master in these terms     Don Manriquez  this is your apartment  mine is in another part of the house  we will pass the night in separate rooms  and will live together by day like mother and son  At first the knight did not know what to make of this  he thought that the lady was only trying his temper  as if her coldness must be wooed to kindness  and her love  like her pardon  not unsought  be won  Imagining  therefore  that good manners required  at least  the shew of passion  he made his advances  and offered  according to the laws of amorous suit enacted in such cases  to assist in the disencumbering duties of her toilet  but  so far from allowing him to interfere with the province of her servant  she pushed him back with a serious air  saying  Hold  Don Manriquez  if you take me for one of those sweet  toothed old women who marry a second time from mere incontinence  you do me a manifest injustice  my proposals were not fraught with conditions of hard service as the tenure of our nuptial contract  the gift of my heart was unmixed with sensual dross  and your gratitude is only drawn upon for returns of pure and platonic friendship  After this explanation  she left my master and me in our apartment  and withdrew to her own with her attendant  forbidding the bridegroom  in the most positive manner  to attempt retiring with her   After her departure  it was some time before we recovered from our surprise at what we had just heard  Scipio  said my master  could you ever have believed that the Marchioness would have talked in such a strain  What think you of so philosophic a bride  I think  sir  answered I  that she is a phoenix among the brood of Hymen  It is for all the world like a good living without parochial duties  For my part  replied Don Manriquez  there is nothing so much to my taste as a wife of modest pretensions  and I mean to make her amends for the trophy she has raised to unadulterated esteem  by all the delicate attentions in my power to pay  We kept up the subject of the lady s moderation till
