  with him ever since she came to town  she  therefore  resolved to desire   the favour of that gentleman to mention it to him  as of his own   accord  and let her know what answer he should make  This idea gave her   some pleasure for a while  but it was as soon dissipated  the thoughts   of her brother Frank s misfortune  and the danger she could not be sure   he was yet perfectly recovered from  came again into her mind  but this   also vanished  on remembering the hopes Lady Trusty had given her  yet   still she was discontented  though she knew not well at what  In fine    she was so little accustomed to reflect much on any thing  much less to   be alone  that it became extremely irksome to her   What a wilderness is   this house   cried she to herself   What a frightful solitude  One would   think all the world knew Lady Mellasin and Miss Flora were gone  that   nobody comes near the door  How still  how quiet  is every thing   Then   would she start up from her chair  measure how many paces were in the   room  look at one picture  then on another  then on her own resemblance   in the great glass  But all this would not do  she wanted somebody to   talk to  something new to amuse her with   I wonder   said she   what is   become of Trueworth   I have not seen him these three days  Indeed  I   used him a little ill at our last conversation  but what of that  If he   loves me as well as he professes  he will not  sure  pretend to be   affronted at any thing I do  My brother desires me to give his   compliments  but if the man will not come to receive them  it is none of   my fault  Yet  after all   continued she  having paused a little   what   privilege has our sex to insult and tyrannize over the men  It is   certainly both ungenerous and ungrateful to use them the worse  for   using us  perhaps  better than we deserve  Mr  Trueworth is a man of   sense  and  if I were in his place  I would not take such treatment from   any woman in the world  I could not much blame him if he never saw me   more  Well  when next he comes  I will  however  behave to him with more   respect        Thus did the dictates of a truly reasonable woman  and the idle humour   of a vain coquette  prevail by turns over her fluctuating mind  Her   adventure at Miss Forward s came fresh into her head  she was in some   moments angry with Mr  Trueworth for offering his advice  in others    more angry with herself  for not having taken it  She remained in this   perplexity till a servant  finding it grew late  and that his master did   not sup at home  came in  and asked her if she would not please to have   the cloth laid  to which she answered  with all her heart  on which  the   table being immediately spread  she eat of something that was there  and   soon after went to bed  where  it is probable  she lost in sleep both   all the pleasure and the pain of her past meditations       Mr  Goodman was all this while  as well as for several succeeding days   also  busily employed on an affair no less disagreeable to him than it   was new to him  but  by the diligence and adroitness of his lawyer  he   got the affidavits  the warrant  and everything necessary for the   intended prosecution of Marplus and Lady Mellasin  ready much sooner   than many others would have done  or he himself had expected       The fatigue and perplexity he was under  was  indeed  very great  as may   be easily supposed  yet did it not render him neglectful of Miss Betsy    She had desired him to speak to her brother on her account  and he did   so the first opportunity  not as if the thing had been mentioned by her    but as if he  in the present situation of his family  thought her   removal expedient       Mr  Thoughtless  from what his sister had said  expecting he should one   time or other be spoke more plainly to upon that subject  had prepared   himself with an answer  He told Mr  Goodman  that nothing could have   been more satisfactory to him than to have his sister with him  if her   being so were any ways proper  Said he   As I
