nature  a wonder far surpassing the flying fish  petrified crab  or travelling lobster  However  from my great love to the profession  I would willingly have them divested of part of their contempt  and part of their finery  the law should kindly take them under the wing of protection  fix them into a corporation  like that of the barbers  and abridge their ignominy and their pensions  As to their abilities in other respects  I would leave that entirely to the public  who are certainly in this case the properest judges—— whether they despise them or no   Yes  my Fum  I would abridge their pensions  A theatrical warrior  who conducts the battles of the stage  should be cooped up with the same caution as a Bantum cock that is kept for fighting  When one of those animals is taken from its native dunghill  we retrench it both in the quantity of its food  and the number of its seraglio  players should in the same manner be fed  not fattened  they should be permitted to get their bread  but not eat the people s bread into the bargain    90 and  instead of being permitted to keep four mistresses  in conscience they should be contented only with two   Were stage players thus brought into bounds  perhaps we should find their admirers less sanguine  and consequently less ridiculous in patronizing them  We should no longer be struck with the absurdity of seeing the same people  whose valour makes such a figure abroad  apostrophizing in the praise of a bouncing blockhead  and wrangling in the defence of a copper tailed actress at home   I shall conclude my letter with the sensible admonition of Mê the philosopher   You love harmony  says he  and are charmed with music  I do not blame you for hearing a fine voice  when you are in your closet with a lovely parterre under your eye  or in the night time  while perhaps the moon diffuses her silver rays  But is a man to carry this passion so far as to let a company of comedians  musicians  and singers  grow rich upon his exhausted fortune  If so  he resembles one of those dead bodies  whose brains the embalmers have picked out through its ears    Adieu   LETTER LXXXIII  From the same   OF all the places of amusement where gentlemen and ladies are entertained  I have not been yet to visit Newmarket  This  I am told  is a large field  where upon certain occasions three or four   91 horses are brought together  then set a running  and that horse which runs fastest wins the wager   This is reckoned a very polite and fashionable amusement here  much more followed by the nobility than partridge fighting at Java  or paper kites in Madagascar  several of the great here  I am told  understand as much of farriery as their grooms  and a horse  with any share of merit  can never want a patron among the nobility   We have a description of this entertainment almost every day in some of the gazettes  as for instance     On such a day the Give and Take Plate was run for between his Grace s Crab  his Lordship s Periwinkle  and  Squire Smackem s Slamerkin  All rode their own horses  There was the greatest concourse of nobility that has been known here for several seasons  The odds were in favour of Crab in the beginning  but Slamerkin  after the first heat  seemed to have the match hollow  however  it was soon seen  that Periwinkle improved in wind  which  at last  turned out accordingly  Crab was run to a stand still  Slamerkin was knocked up  and Periwinkle was brought in with universal applause    Thus you see Periwinkle received universal applause  and no doubt his Lordship came in for some share of that praise which was so liberally bestowed upon Periwinkle  Sun of China  how glorious must the Senator appear in his cap and leather breeches  his whip crossed in his mouth  and thus coming to the goal amongst the shouts of grooms  jockies  pimps  stable bred Dukes  and degraded Generals       92From the description of this princely amusement  now transcribed  and from the great veneration I have for the characters of its principal promoters  I make no doubt but I shall look upon an horserace with becoming reverence  predisposed as I am by a similar amusement  of which I have lately been a spectator  for just now I happened to have an opportunity of being present at a Cart race   Whether this contention between three carts of different parishes was promoted by a subscription among the nobility  or whether the grand jury  in council assembled  had gloriously combined to encourage plaustral merit  I cannot take upon me to determine  but certain it is  the whole was conducted with the utmost regularity and decorum  and the company  which made a brilliant appearance  were universally of opinion  that the sport was high  the running fine  and the riders influenced by no bribe   It was run on the road from London to a village called Brentford  between a turnip cart  a dust cart  and a dung cart
