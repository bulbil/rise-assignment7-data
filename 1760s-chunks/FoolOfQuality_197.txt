cried aloud with heart piercing exclamations   while I   caught up Matty in my arms  and running with her to a distant   apartment  catched a kiss  and locked her in      I returned  but found him in the same violence of agitation  I   spoke to him  I would have comforted him  but he cried Be   quiet  Harry  I will not be comforted  I will go to my children     they shall not be torn from me   we will die  we will be buried  we   will lie in the same grave together       As I found myself sick  and ready to faint under the oppression         200 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      of his lamentations  I withdrew to the next chamber  and there   plentifully vented my woe in weeping      After some time I listened  and perceived that all was quiet  and   returning  I found him in a kind of troubled doze  from whence he   fell into a deep and peaceful sleep  Thus he continued for three   days  wailing and slumbering by fits  without tasting any matter of   nourishment  though his daughter and I implored him on our knees    and with tears  No reasonings  no entreaties  could avail for appeas    ing hhn   it was from the association of our sorrows alone that he   appeared to admit of any consolation      At length his passion subsided into a sullen and silent calm   he   would speak to nobody  he would answer none of us except by   monosyllables      Within a few following weeks  news was brought me that our   ship the Phoenix was arrived in the Downs  safe and richly laden   from the East Indies      Immediately I carried the tidings to the old man  in the pleasing   expectation that they would serve to divert  or at least to amuse    his melancholy  But  fixing his look upon me Wherefore  Harry    dost thou tell me of ships and Indies   he cried  Both Indies are   poor to me   they have nothing that they can send me  I have no   road to go upon earth  no way upon sea to navigate  I am   already become a wild and wasted Babylon   dierein the voice   of music shall never more be heard  O ye old and unblessed   knees  where are now your precious babes who were wont to   play about ye  and to cling and climb upon ye  Gone  gone    gone  gone never  never to return       Here  breaking into tears  I cried We are both young yet  my   father   we may yet have many children to be the comfort of   your age  No  my Harry no  he replied  you may indeed have   many children  but you will never have any children like my   darling children      Mr  Golding from this time no more entered his counting house    nor paid nor received visits  nor kept up any correspondence    Even my company  and that of his daughter  appeared to oppress   him   and he rarely left his apartment  where an old folio Bible   was his only companion      Hereupon I began to withdraw our effects from trade  and    having called in the best part of them  I lodged near half a million   in the Dutch funds  When I went to advise with my father on   the occasion What  my child  said he what have I to say to the   world  or to the things of the world   Do just as you please with   the one and with the other   and never consult a person on any   affair wherein the party consulted has no interest or concern      One morning  as I lay in bed  Matty threw her arms about me    and hiding her blushing face in my bosom My Harry  says she  if   you could handsomely bring it about to my poor papa  perhaps it   would be some matter of consolation to him to know that I am   with child      When I broke the matter to him  he did not at first appear to be   sensibly affected   in time  however  the weight of his affliction   seemed considerably lightened  and  as my wife advanced in her         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  201     pregnancy  he began to look us in the face  he sat with us at one   table  and became conversable as formerly      One day I went to dine with Mr  Settle  a hardware merchant
