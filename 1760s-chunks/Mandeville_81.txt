that matchless form  I see her every moment before me  in all the playfulness of youth and innocence  I see her parents gazing on her as she passes  with that lively transport a parent only can know        It was here her rising blushes first discovered to me the secret of her heart  it was here the loveliest of mankind first implored me to favor his passion for my sweet friend        Pleased with the tender sorrow which possessed all my soul  I determined to indulge it to the utmost  and  revolving in my imagination the happy hours of chearful          2 180       friendship to which that smiling scene had been witness  prolonged my walk till evening had  almost unperceived  spread its gloomy horrors round  till the varied tints of the flowers were lost in the deepening shades of night      Awaking at once from the reverie in which I had been plunged  I found myself at a distance from the house  just entering the little wood so loved by my charming friend  the every moment encreasing darkness gave an awful gloom to the trees  I stopped  I looked round  not a human form was in sight  I listened  and heard not a sound but the trembling of some poplars in the wood  I called  but the echo of my own voice was the only answer I received  a dreary silence reigned around  a terror I never felt before seized me  my heart panted with timid apprehension  I breathed short  I started at every leaf that moved  my limbs were covered with a          2 181       cold dew  I fancied I saw a thousand airy forms flit around me  I seemed to hear the shrieks of the dead and dying  there is no describing my horrors      At the moment when my fears had almost deprived me of sense  I saw Colonel Mandeville approach  I concealed from him the terrors of my soul  lest they should add to the sorrow which consumed him  he addressed me in a faltering voice  conducted me to the house almost without speaking  and leading me into the saloon       Oh  Bellville  How shall I describe what I felt on entering the room        Is not Death of itself sufficiently dreadful  that we thus clothe it in additional terrors  by the horrid apparatus with which we suffer it to be attended  The room was hung with black  lighted up to show the affecting objects it contained  and in the midst  in their coffins  the breathless bodies          2 182       of the hapless lovers  on a couch near them  supported by Emily Howard  the wretched mother wringing her hands in all the agony of despair  Lord Belmont standing by the bodies  looking at them alternately  weeping over his child  and raising his desponding eyes to Heaven  beseeching the God of Mercy to relieve him from this load of misery  and to put a speedy period to that life which was now robbed of all it happiness      I approach Lady Julia s coffin  I gazed eagerly on her angel countenance  serene as that of a sleeping infant  I kissed her lifeless lips  which still wore the smile of innocence and peace  Bellville  may my last end be like hers  May I meet her in the regions of immortality  Never shall I forget her gentle virtues  or the delight I found in her friendship            2 183          She was wrapped in a loose robe of white satten  her head covered with a veil of gause  the village maids  who laid her in the coffin  had adorned her with the freshest flowers  the stood at an awful distance  weeping her hard fate and their own  they have entreated to watch around her this night  and to bear her to morrow to the grave        I had stood some time looking on the dear remains of Lady Julia  when Colonel Mandeville took my hand  and leading me to the coffin in which his son s were deposited   Lady Anne  said he  you have forgot your once favored friend  your once gay  once lovely Harry Mandeville  Behold all that death has left of the darling of a fond parent s heart  The graces of that form are lost  those lips have ceased to utter the generous sentiments of the noblest heart which ever beat  but never will his varied perfections be blotted from the mind of his father             2 184          I approached the most lovely of men  the traces of sorrow were visible on his countenance  he died in the moment when he heard the happiness which had been vainly intended for him  My tears streamed afresh when I beheld him  when I remembered the sweet hours we passed
