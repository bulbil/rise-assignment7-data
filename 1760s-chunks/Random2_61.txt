I suppose  slept these four and twenty hours  —   Bring me some water     said I in a peremptory tone   upon which he sneaked away shrugging his shoulders  Before he returned I had spread my whole stock on the table in the most ostentatious manner  so that when it first saluted his view  he stood like one intranced  and having rubbed his eyes more than once  to assure himself of his being awake  broke out into    Lord have mercy upon us  what a vast treasure is here  —    Tis all our own  Strap   said I  take what is necessary  and redeem the sword immediately    He advanced towards the table  stopt short by the way  looked at the money and me by turns  and with a wildness in his countenance  produced from joy checked by distrust  cried    I dare say  it is honestly come by    To remove his scruples  I made him acquainted with the whole story of my success  on hearing of which  he danced about the room  in an exstacy    God be praised —a white stone —God be praised —a white stone    So that I was afraid the sudden change of fortune had disordered his intellects  and that he was run mad with joy —Extremely concerned at this event  I attempted to reason him out of his frenzy  but to no purpose  for  without regarding what I said  he continued to frisk up and down  and repeat his rhapsody of   God be praised  a white stone    At last  I rose in the utmost consternation  and laying violent hands upon him put a stop to his extravagance  by fixing him down to a settee that was in the room —This constraint banished his delirium  he started as if just awoke  and terrified at my behaviour  cried    What is the   178 matter    When he learned the cause of my apprehension  he was ashamed of his transports  and told me  that in mentioning the white stone  he alluded to the Dies fasti of the Romans  albo lapide notati     Having no inclination to sleep  I secured my cash  dressed  and was just going abroad  when the servant of the house told me  there was a gentlewoman at the door  who wanted to speak with me —Surprized at this information  I bid Strap shew her up  and in less than a minute saw a young woman of a shabby decayed appearance enter my room  After half a dozen court sies  she began to sob  and told me her name was Gawkey  upon which I immediately recollected the features of Miss Lavement  who had been the first occasion of my misfortunes —Though I had all the reason in the world  to resent her treacherous usage of me  I was moved at her distress  and professing my sorrow at seeing her so reduced  desired her to sit  and enquired into the particulars of her situation —She fell upon her knees  and implored my forgivenness for the injuries she had done me  protesting before God  that she was forced against her inclination  into that hellish conspiracy which had almost deprived me of my life  by the intreaties of her husband  who having been afterwards renounced by his father on account of his marriage with her  and unable to support a family on his pay  lest his wife at her father s house  and went with the regiment to Germany  where he was broke for misbehaviour at the battle of Dettingen  since which time she had heard no tidings of him  She then gave me to understand with many symptoms of penitence  that it was her misfortune to bear a   179 child four months after marriage  by which her parents were so incensed  that she was turned out of doors with the infant  that died soon after  and had hitherto subsisted in a miserable indigent manner  on the extorted charity of a few friends  who were now quite tired of giving  that not knowing where or how to support herself one day longer  she had fled for succour even to me  who of all mankind had the least cause to assist her  relying upon the generosity of my disposition  which  she hoped  would be pleased with this opportunity of avenging itself in the noblest manner  on the wretch who had wronged me —I was very much affected with her discourse  and having no cause to suspect the sincerity of her repentance  raised her up  freely pardoned all she had done against me  and promised to befriend her as much as lay in my power   Since my last arrival in London  I had made no advances to the apothecary  imagining it would be impossible for me to make my innocence appear  so unhappily was my accusation circumstanced  Strap indeed had laboured to justify me to the schoolmaster  but so far from succeeding in his attempt  Mr  Concordance dropt all correspondence with him  because he refused to quit his connexion with me —Things being in this situation  I thought a fairer opportunity of vindicating my character could not offer  than that which now presented itself —therefore stipulated with Mrs
