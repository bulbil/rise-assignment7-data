 and such trumpery     to be proprietor of Namur  and of all the towns in Flanders with it   My uncle Toby was a man patient of injuries —not from want of courage —I have told you in the fifth chapter of this second book   That he was a man of courage  —And will add here  that where just occasions presented  or called it forth —I know no man under whose arm I would sooner have taken shelter  nor did this arise from any insensibility or obtuseness of his intellectual parts —for he felt this insult of my father s as feelingly as a man could do —but he was of a peaceful  placid nature —no jarring element in it —all was mix d up so kindly within him  my uncle Toby had scarce a heart to retaliate upon a fly     —Go—says he  one day at dinner  to an over grown one which had buzz d about his nose  and tormented him cruelly all dinner time —and which  after infinite attempts  he had caught at last  as it flew by him —I ll not hurt thee  says my uncle Toby  rising from his chair  and going a cross the room  with the fly in his hand —I ll not hurt a hair of thy head —Go  says he  lifting up the sash  and opening his hand as he spoke  to let it escape —go poor devil  get thee gone  why should I hurt thee —This world surely is wide enough to hold both thee and me   I was but ten years old when this happened —but whether it was  that the action itself was more in unison to my nerves at that age of pity  which instantly set my whole frame into one vibration    of most pleasurable sensation —or how far the manner and expression of it might go towards it —or in what degree  or by what secret magic —a tone of voice and harmony of movement  attuned by mercy  might find a passage to my heart  I know not —this I know  that the lesson of universal good will then taught and imprinted by my uncle Toby  has never since been worn out of my mind  And tho  I would not depreciate what the study of the Literae humaniores  at the university  have done for me in that respect  or discredit the other helps of an expensive education bestowed upon me  both at home and abroad since —yet I often think that I owe one half of my philanthropy to that one accidental impression   ☞ This is to serve for parents and governors instead of a whole volume upon the subject     I could not give the reader this stroke in my uncle Toby s picture  by the instrument with which I drew the other parts of it —that taking in no more than the mere HOBBY HORSICAL likeness —this is a part of his moral character  My father  in this patient endurance of wrongs  which I mention  was very different  as the reader must long ago have noted  he had a much more acute and quick sensibility of nature  attended with a little soreness of temper  tho  this never transported him to any thing which looked like malignancy —yet  in the little rubs and vexations of life   twas apt to shew itself in a drollish and witty kind of peevishness —He was  however  frank and generous in his nature —at all times open to conviction  and in the little ebullitions of this subacid humour towards others  but particularly    towards my uncle Toby  whom he truly loved —he would feel more pain  ten times told  except in the affair of my aunt Dinah  or where an hypothesis was concerned  than what he ever gave   The characters of the two brothers  in this view of them  reflected light upon each other  and appear d with great advantage in this affair which arose about Stevinus   I need not tell the reader  if he keeps a HOBBY HORSE —that a man s HOBBY HORSE is as tender a part as he has about him  and that these unprovoked strokes  at my uncle Toby s could not be unfelt by him —No —as I said above  my uncle Toby did feel them  and very sensibly too     Pray  Sir  what said he —How did he behave —Oh  Sir —it was great  For as soon as my father had done insulting his HOBBY HORSE —he turned his head  without the least emotion  from Dr  Slop  to whom he was addressing his discourse  and look d up into my father s face  with a countenance spread over with so much good nature —so placid —so fraternal —so inexpressibly tender towards him —it penetrated my father to his heart  He rose up hastily from his chair  and seizing hold of both my uncle Toby s hands as he spoke —Brother Toby  said he —I beg thy pardon —forgive  I pray thee  this rash humour which my mother gave me —My dear  dear brother  answer d my uncle Toby  rising up by my father s help  say no more about it —you are heartily welcome  had it been ten times as much     brother  But  tis ungenerous  replied  my father
