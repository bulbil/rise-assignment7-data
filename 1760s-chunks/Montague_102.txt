their meeting  though prepared  it was with difficulty we kept my mother from fainting  she pressed him in her arms  she attempted to speak  her voice faltered  tears stole softly down her cheeks  nor was Rivers less affected  though in a different manner  I never saw him look so handsome  the manly tenderness  the filial respect  the lively joy  that were expressed in his countenance  gave him a look to which it is impossible to do justice  he hinted going down to Berkshire to night  but my mother seemed so hurt at the proposal  that he wrote to Emily  and told her his reason for deferring it till to morrow  when we are all to go in my coach  and hope to bring her back with us to town       You judge rightly  my dear Bell  that they were formed for each other  never were two minds so similar  we must contrive some method of making them happy  nothing but a too great delicacy in Rivers prevents their being so to morrow  were our situations changed  I should not hesitate a moment to let him make me so       Lucy has sent for me  Adieu       Believe me   Your faithful and devoted   J  TEMPLE     LETTER CLXVI   166   To Miss FERMOR  at Silleri   Pall Mall  July 29   I AM the happiest of human beings  my Rivers is arrived  he is well  he loves me  I am dear to his family  I see him without restraint  I am every hour more convinced of the excess of his affection  his attention to me is inconceivable  his eyes every moment tell me  I am dearer to him than life       I am to be for some time on a visit to his sister  he is at Mrs  Rivers s  but we are always together  we go down next week to Mr  Temple s  in Rutland  they only stayed in town  expecting Rivers s arrival  His seat is within six miles of Rivers s little paternal estate  which he settled on his mother when he left England  she presses him to resume it  but he peremptorily refuses  he insists on her continuing her house in town  and being perfectly independent  and mistress of herself       I love him a thousand times more for this tenderness to her  though it disappoints my dear hope of being his  Did I think it possible  my dear Bell  he could have risen higher in my esteem       If we are never united  if we always live as at present  his tenderness will still make the delight of my life  to see him  to hear that voice  to be his friend  the confidante of all his purposes  of all his designs  to hear the sentiments of that generous  that exalted soul I would not give up this delight  to be empress of the world       My ideas of affection are perhaps uncommon  but they are not the less just  nor the less in nature       A blind man may as well judge of colors as the mass of mankind of the sentiments of a truly enamored heart       The sensual and the cold will equally condemn my affection as romantic  few minds  my dear Bell  are capable of love  they feel passion  they feel esteem  they even feel that mixture of both which is the best counterfeit of love  but of that vivifying fire  that lively tenderness which hurries us out of ourselves  they know nothing  that tenderness which makes us forget ourselves  when the interest  the happiness  the honor  of him we love is concerned  that tenderness which renders the beloved object all that we see in the creation       Yes  my Rivers  I live  I breathe  I exist  for you alone  be happy  and your Emily is so       My dear friend  you know love  and will therefore bear with all the impertinence of a tender heart       I hope you have by this time made Fitzgerald happy  he deserves you  amiable as you are  and you cannot too soon convince him of your affection  you sometimes play cruelly with his tenderness  I have been astonished to see you torment a heart which adores you       I am interrupted       Adieu  my dear Bell   Your affectionate  EMILY MONTAGUE     LETTER CLXVII   167   To Captain FERMOR  at Silleri   Clarges Street  Aug  1   LORD — not being in town  I went to his villa at Richmond  to deliver your letter       I cannot enough  my dear Sir  thank you for this introduction  I passed part of the day at Richmond  and never was more pleasingly entertained        His politeness  his learning  his knowledge of the world  however amiable  are in character at his season of life  but his vivacity is astonishing       What fire  what spirit  there is in his conversation  I hardly thought myself a young man near him  What must he have been at
