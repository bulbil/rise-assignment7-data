he wished his friend might think as I did  that he would tell me his name another time  and that  in the mean time  it would oblige him if my visits to you were less frequent  Inhuman monster  said she  would he debar me of the only satisfaction I have  Let me but live to get out of his hands  if I can escape him by any means  I will find ways to reckon with him for this  Be so good  Mr Pivet to tell him  that I am content to take the person he offers  let him be who he will  I shall expect nothing from him but insults  therefore shall not be surprized if I see myself sacrificed to some despicable wretch  but any  any thing is better than to be in the power of such a tyrant  Madam  answered Pivet  you need not fear the being compelled to accept of an unworthy object  Mr Faulkland declares  that if you should absolutely dislike the gentleman  when you see him  he will be far from constraining you to take him for your husband  The other choice is still open to you  and  by what I can judge  Mr Faulkland seems to wish you would give that the preference  I would die first  cried Mrs Gerrarde—The fool  does he think I can be so entrapped  No  no  the authority of a husband  even of Faulkland’s chusing  cannot be such a bar to my revenge as the walls of a nunnery would be —Sir  I think myself obliged to you  and flatter myself you would have served me if you could  I may yet have it in my power to make you a return for your kind intentions towards me  I presume  when Mr Faulkland has disposed of his property  you will then be absolved of your promise to him in regard to me  and will still have charity enough to befriend an unfortunate woman  She wept  and Pivet owned he was ready to do so too  but constraining himself  protested she should command his life  and withdrew full of seeming uneasiness   He told me what had passed between him and the lady  and I could not help approving his management of the scene  though the rogue had stretched beyond the truth  but stratagems  you know  are    allowable in love  and a lover he was now become in good earnest   He had taken care to alarm Mrs Gerrarde’s apprehensions at every passage of access  He had informed her  that I had a husband for her in my thoughts  and at the same time  that he avoided the most distant hint of its being himself  he engaged her favour by seeming to wish it were  Then he took care to insinuate  at least  a possibility of her being refused by the person designed for her  and this he very naturally supposed would raise his own consequence with her  in case any suspicion should fall on him  of his being the intended husband  He pretended I had taken umbrage at his visiting her  still more to inflame her resentment against me  and increase her impatience to deliver herself out of my hands  at the same time he artfully hinted that he was not the man destined to be happy  This  as he saw already he was not unacceptable to her  he thought would make him doubly welcome  when she should find herself no worse off  Then the nunnery was mentioned  in terrorem  with broad hints of my resolution  In short  Pivet played his part so cunningly  that it had all the effect he could have wished  and Mrs Gerrarde  finding her spirit matched  was obliged to surrender at discretion   I own I did not expect to have succeeded so soon  and without Pivet  who had now a feeling in the affair  I certainly should not  I resolved directly to make the best use of the advantage I had gained  I told Pivet that he should be married the next day  He was so transported at the thought  that he begged I would give him leave to go to Mrs Gerrarde  to declare his love and his good fortune together  for Sir  said he  you know she promises to accept of whomsoever you propose  and I hope she will not dispise your choice so much as she thinks she shall  Softly  softly  good Monsieur Pivet  your violent hurry will spoil all  I do not mean that you shall see her till to morrow  Not till to morrow  Ah Sir  do  I beseech you  Sir  allow me  she will think it very cruel   Poor Pivet  thought I  thou wilt have enough of her   Simpleton  to him   this day’s suspence will forward your business more than all you could say to her in seven hours  is it not enough you are sure of her  We have other things now to mind  What plan of life do you purpose to pursue  You know I have promised to do handsomely for you   Sir  said he  I always intended to follow the business I was bred to  and if this piece of extraordinary good fortune had not happened to me  I did purpose
