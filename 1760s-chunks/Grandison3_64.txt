for so it proved  But he was too polite  too great  shall I say  to take notice of my petulance  How little does it make me in my own eyes   Had I  said he  ever so easily obtained a knowlege of my sister s mind  I should not have known how to depend upon it  were it not strengthened  madam    157 from your lips  The conference  therefore  which you gave me hopes you would favour me with  would have been absolutely necessary  I hope Miss Byron will allow me to invite her to it to morrow morning  The intended subject of it is a very serious one with me  My sister s happiness  and that of a man not unworthy  are concerned in it  lightly as Charlotte has hitherto treated it  He bowed and was going   Miss Gr  Nay  pray  brother—You must not leave me in anger   Sir Ch  I do not  Charlotte  I had rather bear with you  than you should with me  I see you cannot help it  A lively heart is a great blessing  Indulge it  Now is your time   Dear doctor  said Miss Grandison  when Sir Charles was gone out  What can be the meaning of my brother s gravity  It alarms me   Dr  B  If goodness  madam  would make an heart lively  Sir Charles s would be as lively as your own  but you might have perceived by his air  when he entered  that the letters brought him affected him too much to permit him to laugh off a light answer to a serious question   Miss Gr  Dear doctor —But I do now recollect  that he entered with some little discomposure on his countenance  How could I be so inattentive   Harriet  And I  too  I doubt  was a little captious   Dr  B  A very little  Pardon me  madam   Just then came in the excellent man   Dr  Bartlett  I could wish to ask you one question  said he   Miss Gr  You are angry with me brother   Sir Ch  No  my dear —But I am afraid I withdrew with too grave an air  I have been a thousand times pleased with you  Charlotte  to one time displeased  and when I have been the latter  you have always known it  I had something in my hand that ruffled me a little  But how could patience be patience    158 if it were not tried  I wanted to say a few words to my good Dr  Bartlett  And  to say truth  being conscious that I had departed a little abruptly  I could not be easy till I apologized in person for it  therefore came to ask the favour of the doctor s advice  rather than request it by message   The doctor and he withdrew together   In these small instances  said my Lord  are the characters of the heart displayed  far more than in greater  What excellence shines out in full lustre  on this unaffected and seemingly little occasion  Fear of offending  of giving uneasiness  sollicitude to remove doubts  patience recommended in one short sentence  more forcibly than some would have done it in a long discourse  as well as by example  censuring himself  not from a consciousness of being wrong  but of being taken wrong  Ah  my dear sister Charlotte  we should all edify by such an example—But I say no more   Miss Gr  And have you nothing to say  Harriet   Harriet  Very little  since I have been much to blame myself  Yet let me remind my Charlotte  that her brother was displeased with her yesterday  for treating too lightly a subject he had engaged in seriously  and that he has been forced to refer to her friend  rather than to herself  to help him to the knowlege of her mind  O Charlotte  regret you not the occasion given for the expedient  And do you not  Yes  I see you do  blush for giving it  Yet to see him come voluntarily back  when he had left us in a grave humour  for fear the babies should think him angry with them  O how great is he  and how little are we   Miss Gr  Your servant  sister Harriet —You have made a dainty speech  I think  But  great and good as my brother is  we know how it comes to pass  that your pretty imagination is always at work to aggrandize the man  and to lower the babies     159  Harriet  I will not say another word on the subject  You are not generous  Charlotte   She took my hand  Forgive me  my dear—I touch d too tender a string  Then turning to Miss Jervois  and with the other hand taking hers  Why twinkles thus my girl —I charge you  Emily  tell me all you think   I am thinking  said she  that my guardian is not happy  To see him bear with every body  to have him keep all his troubles to himself  because he would not afflict any body
