   So did this generous good gentleman bless us all  and me in particular    for whose sake he was as bounteous as if he had married one of the   noblest fortunes       So he took his leave of the gentlemen  recommending secrecy again  for   a few days  and they left him  and none of the servants suspected any   thing  as Mrs  Jewkes believes  And then I threw myself at his feet    blessed God  and blessed him for his goodness  and he overwhelmed me   with kindness  calling me his sweet bride  and twenty lovely epithets    that swell my grateful heart beyond the power of utterance       He afterwards led me to the chariot  and we took a delightful tour round   the neighbouring villages  and he did all he could to dissipate those   still perverse anxieties that dwell upon my mind  and  do what I can    spread too thoughtful an air  as he tells me  over my countenance       We came home again by half an hour after one  and he was pleasing   himself with thinking  not to be an hour out of my company this blessed   day  that  as he was so good as to say  he might inspire me with a   familiarity that should improve my confidence in him  when he was told    that a footman of Sir Charles Hargrave had been here  to let him know    that his master  and two other gentlemen  were on the road to take a   dinner with him  in their way to Nottingham       He was heartily vexed at this  and said to me  He should have been   glad of their companies at any other time  but that it was a barbarous   intrusion now  and he wished they had been told he would not be at home   at dinner  And besides  said he  they are horrid drinkers  and I shan t   be able to get them away to night  perhaps  for they have nothing to do    but to travel round the country  and beat up their friends  quarters all   the way  and it is all one to them  whether they stay a night or a month   at a place  But  added he  I ll find some way  if I can  to turn them   off  after dinner   Confound them  said he  in a violent pet  that they   should come this day  of all the days in the year       We had hardly alighted  and got in  before they came  Three mad rakes   they seemed to be  as I looked through the window  setting up a hunting   note  as soon as they came to the gate  that made the court yard echo   again  and smacking their whips in concert       So I went up to my chamber  and saw  what made my heart throb  Mrs    Jewkes s officious pains to put the room in order for a guest  that    however welcome  as now my duty teaches me to say  is yet dreadful to me   to think of  So I took refuge in my closet  and had recourse to pen and   ink  for my amusement  and to divert my anxiety of mind   If one s   heart is so sad  and one s apprehension so great  where one so extremely   loves  and is so extremely obliged  what must be the case of those poor   maidens  who are forced  for sordid views  by their tyrannical parents   or guardians  to marry the man they almost hate  and  perhaps  to the   loss of the man they most love  O that is a sad thing  indeed   And what   have not such cruel parents to answer for  And what do not such poor   innocent victims suffer   But  blessed be God  this lot is far from   being mine       My good master  for I cannot yet have the presumption to call him by a   more tender name  came up to me  and said  Well  I just come to ask my   dear bride  O the charming  charming word   how she does  I see you are   writing  my dear  said he  These confounded rakes are half mad  I think    and will make me so  However  said he  I have ordered my chariot to be   got ready  as if I was under an engagement five miles off  and will set   them out of the house  if possible  and then ride round  and come back    as soon as I can get rid of them  I find  said he  Lady Davers is full   of our affairs
