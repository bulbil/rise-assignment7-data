 In good truth  you may say that  answered the landlady  you may rack your brains as long as you like  but you will never think of anything half so miserable as what they are suffering at this present moment  Gil Perez  good soul  is defunct all down one side by a stroke of the palsy  and the other half of him is little better than a corpse  we cannot expect him to last long  then your father  who went to live with his reverence a little while ago  is troubled with an inflammation of the lungs  and is standing  as a body may say  quavery mavery between life and death  while your mother  who is not over and above hale and hearty herself  is obliged to nurse them both   On this intelligence  which made me feel some compunctious yearnings of nature  I left Bertrand with my stud and baggage at the inn  then  with my secretary at my heels  who would not desert me in my time of need  I repaired to my uncle s house  The moment I came within my mother s reach  a natural emotion of maternal instinct unfolded to her who I was  before her eyes could possibly have run over the traces of my countenance  Son  said she  with a melancholy expression  after having embraced me  come and be present at your father s death  your visit is just in time to take in all the piteous circumstances of so deplorable an event  With this heart rending reception  she led me by the hand into a chamber where the wretched Blas of Santillane  stretched on a comfortless bed  in cold and dismal accord with the thinness of his fortunes  was just entering on the last great act of human nature  Though surrounded by the shades of death  he was not quite unconscious of what was passing about him  My dearest friend  said my mother  here is your son Gil Blas  who entreats your forgiveness for all his undutiful behaviour  and is come to ask your blessing before you die  At these tidings my father opened his eyes  which where on the point of closing for ever  he fixed them upon me  and reading in my countenance  notwithstanding the awful brink on which he stood  that I was a sincere mourner for his loss  his feelings were recalled to sympathy by my sorrow  He even made an attempt to speak  but his strength was too much exhausted  I took one of his hands in mine  and while I bathed it with my tears  in speechless agony of soul  he breathed his last  as if he had only waited my arrival to pay the debt of nature  and wing his way to scenes of untried being   This event had been too long present to my mother s mind to overwhelm her with any unparalleled affliction  Perhaps it sat more heavily on me than on her  though my father had never in his life given me any reason to feel for him as a father  But besides that mere filial instinct would have made me weep over his cold remains  I reproached myself with not having contributed to the comfort of his latter days  then  when I considered what a hard  hearted villain I had been  I seemed to myself like a monster of ingratitude  or rather like an impious parricide  My uncle  whom I afterwards saw lying at his length on another wretched couch  and in a most lamentable pickle  made me experience fresh agonies of upbraiding conscience  Unnatural son  said I  communing with my own uneasy thoughts  behold the chastisement of heaven upon thy sins  in the disconsolate condition of thy nearest relations  Hadst thou but thrown to them the superflux of that abundance  in which before thy imprisonment thou rolledst  thou mightest have procured for them those little comforts which thy uncle s ecclesiastical pittance was too scanty to furnish  and perhaps have lengthened out the term of thy father s life   Gil Perez had fallen into a state of second childhood  and was  though numerically upon the list of the living  in every individual organ a mere corpse  His memory  nay  his very senses had retired from their allotted stations in his system  Bootless was it for me to strain him in my pious arms  and lavish outward tokens of affection on him  they might as well have been wasted on the desert air  To as little purpose did my mother ring in his unnerved ear  that I was his nephew Gil Blas  be gazed at me with a vacant  stupid stare  and gave neither sign nor answer  Had the ties of consanguinity and gratitude been all too weak  to awaken my tender sympathy for an uncle  to whom I owed the means of my first launch into the world  the impression of helpless dotage on my senses must have softened me into something like the counterfeit of virtuous emotion   While this scene was passing  Scipio preserved a melancholy silence  sharing in all my sorrows  and mingling his sighs with mine in the chastised luxury of friendship  But concluding that my mother  after so long an absence  might wish to have some such conversation with me  as the presence of a stranger must rather repress than promote
