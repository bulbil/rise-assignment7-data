am   well assured I never can  I therefore beg your ladyship   continued she    with an air both serious and disdainful   to advise them to desist all   thoughts of me on the account you mention  and to let them know I did   not come to L    e to get a husband  but to avoid all impertinent   proposals of that kind         It is not in L    e   replied Lady Trusty  a little piqued at these last   words   but in London you are to expect proposals deserving this   contempt  here are no false glosses to deceive or impose on the   understanding  here are no pretenders to birth  or to estate  every one   is known for what he really is  and none will presume to make his   addresses to a woman without a consciousness of being qualified to   receive the approbation of her friends         I will not dispute with your ladyship on this point   replied Mrs    Munden   I grant there is less artifice in the country than the town    and should scarce make choice of a man that has been bred  and chuses to   reside always  in the latter  but Madam  it is not the place of   nativity  nor the birth  nor the estate  but the person  and the temper   of the man  can make me truly happy  I shall always pay a just regard to   the advice of my friends  and particularly to your ladyship  but as I   have been once a sacrifice to their persuasions  I hope you will have   the goodness to forgive me when I say  that if ever I become a wife   again  love  an infinity of love  shall be the chief inducement         On whose side   cried Lady Trusty hastily   On both  I hope  Madam     replied Mrs  Munden with a smile        Take care  my dear   rejoined the other   for if you should find   yourself deceived in that of the man  your own would only serve to   render you the more unhappy        The fair widow was about to make some answer  which perhaps would have   let Lady Trusty into the whole secret of her heart  if the conversation   had not been broke off by a very loud ringing of the bell at the great   gate of the courtyard before the house  on which  as it was natural for   them  they both ran to the window to see what company were coming       The first object that presented itself to them was a very neat running   footman  who  on the gate being opened  came tripping up towards the   house  and was immediately followed by a coach  with one gentleman in   it  drawn by six prancing horses  and attended by two servants in rich   liveries  and well mounted  Lady Trusty was somewhat surprized  as she   never had seen either the person in the coach  or the equipage  before    but infinitely more so when Mrs  Munden  starting from the window in the   greatest confusion imaginable  cried   Madam  with your leave  I will   speak to him in the parlour     Speak to whom   said Lady Trusty  The   other had not power to answer and was running out of the room  when a   servant of Sir Ralph s came up to tell her a gentleman  who called   himself Trueworth  was come to wait on her   I know  I know   cried she     conduct him into the parlour        Prepared as she was by the expectation of his arrival  all her presence   of mind was not sufficient to enable her to stand the sudden rush of joy   which on sight of him bursted in upon her heart  nor was he less   overcome  he sprang into her arms  which of themselves opened to receive   him  and  while he kissed away the tears that trickled from her eyes    his own bedewed her cheeks   Oh  have I lived to see you thus   cried   he   thus ravishingly kind     And have I lived   rejoined she   to   receive these proofs of affection from the best and most ill used of   men  Oh  Trueworth  Trueworth   added she   I have not merited this from   you     You merit all things   said he   let us talk no more of what is   past  but tell me that you now are mine  I came to make you so by the   irrevocable ties of love and law  and
