but in great hurry went to her closet  and taking down her bible  turned over one leaf and another very quick  Lady Sforza had a book in her hand  and sat over against the closet door to observe her motions  She came to a place—Pretty  said she   The Bishop had formerly given her a smattering of Latin—She took pen and ink  and wrote  You ll see  Chevalier  the very great purity of her thoughts  by what she omitted  and what she chose  from the Canticles  Velut unguentum diffunditur nomen tuum   c    In the English translation  thus    Thy name is as ointment poured forth  therefore do the virgins love thee  Draw me  we will run after thee  The upright love thee   Look not upon me because I am black  because the sun hath looked upon me  My mother s children were angry with me  They made me the keeper of the vineyards  but mine own vineyard have I not kept   Tell me  O thou whom my soul loveth  where thou feedest  where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon  For why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions     She laid down her pen  and was thoughtful  her elbow resting on the escritoire she wrote upon  her hand supporting her head   May I look over you  my dear  said her aunt  stepping to her  and  taking up the paper  read it  and took it out of the closet with her  unopposed  her gentle bosom only heaving with sighs     360 I will write no more  so minutely  on this affecting subject  my Grandison   They are all of opinion that she will be easy  when she knows that you have actually left Bologna  and they strengthen their opinion by these words of hers  above recited     Why he will be gone  I tell you  and this makes me so impatient    —At least  they are resolved to try the experiment  And so  my dear Grandison  you must be permitted to leave us     God be your director and comforter  as well as ours  prays  Your ever affectionate JERONYMO   Mr  Grandison  having no hopes of being allowed to see the unhappy Lady  set out with a heavy heart for Florence  He gave orders there  and at Leghorn  that the clerks and agents of his late friend Mr  Jervois should prepare every thing for his inspection against his return from Naples  and then he set out for that city  to attend the General   He had other friends to whom he had endeared himself at Sienna  Ancona  and particularly at Rome  as he had also some at Naples  of whom he intended to take leave  before he set out for Paris  And therefore went to attend the General with the greater pleasure   Within the appointed time he arrived at Naples   The General received me  says Mr  Grandison  with greater tokens of politeness than affection  You are the happiest man in the world  Chevalier  said he  after the first compliments  in escaping dangers by braving them  I do assure you  that I had great difficulties to deny myself the favour of paying you a visit in my own way at Bologna  I had indeed resolved to do it  till you proposed this visit to me here   I should have been very sorry  replied I  to have seen a brother of Lady Clementina in any way that   361 should not have made me consider him as her brother  But  before I say another word  let me ask after her health  How does the most excellent of women   You have not heard  then   I have not  my Lord  But it is not for want of solicitude  I have sent three several messengers  but can hear nothing to my satisfaction   Nor can you hear any thing from me that will give you any   I am grieved at my soul  that I cannot  How  my Lord  do the Marquis and Marchioness   Don t ask  They are extremely unhappy   I hear that my dear friend Signor Jeronymo  has undergone—  A dreadful operation  innterrupted the General —He has  Poor Jeronymo  He could not write to you  God preserve my brother  But  Chevalier  you did not save half a life  tho  we thank you for that  when you restored him to our arms   I had no reason to boast  my Lord  of the accident  I never made a merit of it  It was a mere accident  and cost me nothing  The service was greatly over rated   Would to God  Chevalier  it had been rendered by any other man in the world   As it has proved  I am sure  my Lord  I have reason to join in the wish   He shewed me his pictures  statues  and cabinet of curiosities  while dinner was preparing  but rather for the ostentation of his magnificence and taste  than to do me pleasure
