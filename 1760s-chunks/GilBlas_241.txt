his lordship  and had nursed poor dear Cupid with such assiduity  as to throw myself into a fit of illness  A violent fever seized me  so that I was almost at death s door  They did what they pleased with me for a whole fortnight  without my consciousness  for the physicians and the fates were both conspiring against me  But my youth was more than a match for the fever and the prescriptions united  When I recovered my senses  the first use I made of them was to observe myself removed to another room  I wanted to know why  and asked an old woman who nursed me  but she told me that I must not talk  as the physician had expressly forbidden it  When we are well  we turn up our noses at the doctors  but when we are sick  we are as much like old women as themselves   It seemed best therefore to keep silence  though with an inveterate longing to hold converse with my attendant I was debating the point in my own mind  when there came in two foppish looking fellows  dressed in the very extreme of fashion  Nothing less than velvet would serve their turn  with linen and lace to correspond  They looked like men of rank  and I could have sworn that they were some of my master s friends come to see me out of regard for him  Under that impression I attempted to sit up  and flung away my nightcap to look genteel  but the nurse forced me under the bedclothes again  and tucked me up  announcing these gentlemen at the same time  as my physician and apothecary   The doctor came up to my bedside  felt my pulse  looked in my face  and discovering undeniable symptoms of approaching convalescence  assumed an air of triumph  as if it was all his handiwork  and said there was nothing wanting but to keep the bowels open  and then he flattered himself he might boast of having performed an extraordinary cure  Speaking after this manner  he dictated a prescription to the apothecary  looking in the glass all the time  adjusting the dress of his hair  and twisting his visage into shapes which set me laughing in spite of my debility  At length he took his leave with a slight inclination of the head  and went his way  more taken with the contemplation of his own pretty person  than anxious about the success of his remedies   After his departure  the apothecary  not to have the trouble of a visit for nothing  made ready to proceed as it is prescribed in certain cases  Whether he was afraid that the old woman s skill was not equal to the exigency  or whether he meant to enhance his own services by assiduity  he chose to operate in person  but in spite of practice and experience  accidents will happen  Haste to return benefits is among the most amiable propensities of our nature  and such was my eagerness not to be behindhand with my benefactor  that his velvet dress bore immediate testimony to the profuseness of my gratitude  This he considered merely as one of those little occurrences which chequer the fortunes of the pharmaceutical profession  A napkin is a resource for everything in a sick room  and least said was soonest mended  so he wiped himself quietly  vowing indemnity and vengeance to himself for the necessity under which he unquestionably laboured of sending his clothes to the scourer   On the following morning he returned to the attack more modestly equipped  though there was then no risk of my springing a countermine  as he had only to administer the potion which the doctor had prescribed the evening before  Besides that I felt myself getting better every moment  I had taken such a dislike  since the day before  to the pill dispensing tribe  as to curse the very universities where these graduated cut throats kept their exercises in the faculty of slaying  In this temper of mind  I declared  with a round oath  that I would not accept of health through such a medium  but would willingly make over Hippocrates and his myrmidons to the devil  The apothecary  who did not care a doit what became of his compound  if it was but paid for  left the phial on the table  and stalked away in Telamonian silence   I immediately ordered that bitch of a medicine to be thrown out of window  having set myself so doggedly against it  that I would as soon have swallowed arsenic  Having once drawn the sword  I threw away the scabbard  and erecting my tongue into an independent potentate  told my nurse in a determined tone  that she must absolutely inform me what was become of my master  The old lady  fearing lest the development of the mystery might completely overset me  or thinking possibly that her prey might escape out of her clutches for want of a little irritating contradiction  was most provokingly mute  but I was so pressing in my demand to be obeyed  that she at length gave me a decisive answer  Worthy sir  you have no longer any master but your own will  Count Galiano is gone back into Sicily   I could not believe my ears  and yet it was fatally the fact  That nobleman  on the second day of my indisposition  being
