a larger gang of petty thieves  who steal sheep and poultry through mere idleness  and were they confronted with an enemy  would steal themselves away  What is your       but a knot of thieves  who pillage the nation under colour of law  and enrich themselves with the wreck of their country  When you consider the enormous debt of above an hundred millions  the intolerable load of taxes and impositions under which we groan  and the manner in which that burden is yearly accumulating  to support two German electorates  without our receiving anything in return  but the shows of triumph and shadows of conquest —I say  when you reflect on these circumstances  and at the same time behold our cities filled with bankrupts  and our country with beggars  can you be so infatuated as to deny that the ministry is mad  or worse than mad—our wealth exhausted  our people miserable  our credit blasted  and our state on the brink of perdition  This prospect  indeed  will make the fainter impression  if we recollect that we ourselves are a pack of such profligate  corrupted  pusillanimous rascals  as deserve no salvation    The stranger  raising his voice to a loud tone  replied   Such  indeed  are the insinuations  equally false and insidious  with which the desperate emissaries of a party endeavour to poison the minds of his majesty s subjects  in defiance of common honesty and common sense  But he must be blind to all perception  and dead to candour  who does not see and own that we are involved in a just and necessary war  which has been maintained on truly British principles  prosecuted with vigour  and crowned with success  that our taxes are easy  in proportion to our wealth  that our conquests are equally glorious and important  that our commerce flourishes  our people are happy  and our enemies reduced to despair  Is there a man who boasts a British heart  that repines at the success and prosperity of his country  Such there are   Oh  shame to patriotism  and reproach to Great Britain   who act as the emissaries of France  both in word and writing  who exaggerate our necessary burdens  magnify our dangers  extol the power of our enemies  deride our victories  extenuate our conquests  condemn the measures of our government  and scatter the seeds of dissatisfaction through the land  Such domestic traitors are doubly the objects of detestation —first  in perverting truth  and  secondly  in propagating falsehood  to the prejudice of that community of which they have professed themselves members  One of these is well known by the name of Ferret  an old  rancorous  incorrigible instrument of sedition  Happy it is for him that he has never fallen in my way  for  notwithstanding the maxims of forbearance which I have adopted  the indignation which the character of that caitiff inspires  would probably impel me to some act of violence  and I should crush him like an ungrateful viper  that gnawed the bosom which warmed it into life    These last words were pronounced with a wildness of look  that even bordered upon frenzy  The misanthrope once more retired to the pantry for shelter  and the rest of the guests were evidently disconcerted   Mr  Fillet  in order to change the conversation  which was likely to produce serious consequences  expressed uncommon satisfaction at the remarks which the knight had made  signified his approbation of the honourable office he had undertaken  declared himself happy in having seen such an accomplished cavalier  and observed  that nothing was wanting to render him a complete knight errant  but some celebrated beauty  the mistress of his heart  whose idea might animate his breast  and strengthen his arm to the utmost exertion of valour  He added  that love was the soul of chivalry   The stranger started at this discourse  He turned his eyes on the surgeon with a fixed regard  his countenance changed  a torrent of tears gushed down his cheeks  his head sunk upon his bosom  he heaved a profound sigh  and remained in silence with all the external marks of unutterable sorrow  The company were  in some measure  infected by his despondence  concerning the cause of which  however  they would not venture to inquire   By this time the landlady  having disposed of the squire  desired to know  with many curtsies  if his honour would not choose to put off his wet garments  assuring him  that she had a very good feather bed at his service  upon which many gentlevolks of the virst quality had lain  that the sheets were well aired  and that Dolly would warm them for his worship with a pan of coals  This hospitable offer being repeated  he seemed to wake from a trance of grief  arose from his seat  and  bowing courteously to the company  withdrew   Captain Crowe  whose faculty of speech had been all this time absorbed in amazement  now broke into the conversation with a volley of interjections   Split my snatchblock —Odd s firkin —Splice my old shoes —I have sailed the salt seas  brother  since I was no higher than the Triton s taffrel—east  west  north  and south  as
