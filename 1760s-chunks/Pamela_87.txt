to church   now  and so I did not ask  and I was the more indifferent  because  if I   might have had permission  the sight of the neighbouring gentry  who had   despised my sufferings  would have given me great regret and sorrow  and   it was impossible I should have edified under any doctrine preached by   Mr  Peters  So I applied myself to my private devotions       Mr  Williams came yesterday  and this day  as usual  and took my letter    but  having no good opportunity  we avoided one another s conversation    and kept at a distance  But I was concerned I had not the key  for I   would not have lost a moment in that case  had I been he  and he I  When   I was at my devotion  Mrs  Jewkes came up  and wanted me sadly to sing   her a psalm  as she had often on common days importuned me for a song   upon the spinnet  but I declined it  because my spirits were so low I   could hardly speak  nor cared to be spoken to  but when she was gone  I   remembering the cxxxviith psalm to be a little touching  turned to it    and took the liberty to alter it  somewhat nearer to my case  I hope I   did not sin in it  but thus I turned it                     I         When sad I sat in B    n Hall        All guarded round about      And thought of ev ry absent friend        The tears for grief burst out                    II         My joys and hopes all overthrown        My heart strings almost broke      Unfit my mind for melody        Much more to bear a joke                   III         Then she to whom I pris ner was        Said to me  tauntingly      Now cheer your heart  and sing a song       And tune your mind to joy                    IV         Alas  said I  how can I frame       My heavy heart to sing      Or tune my mind  while thus enthrall d       By such a wicked thing                     V         But yet  if from my innocence       I  ev n in thought  should slide      Then let my fingers quite forget       The sweet spinnet to guide                    VI         And let my tongue within my mouth       Be lock d for ever fast      If I rejoice  before I see       My full deliv rance past                   VII         And thou  Almighty  recompense       The evils I endure      From those who seek my sad disgrace        So causeless  to procure                  VIII         Remember  Lord  this Mrs  Jewkes        When  with a mighty sound      She cries  Down with her chastity        Down to the very ground                    IX         Ev n so shalt thou  O wicked one        At length to shame be brought      And happy shall all those be call d       That my deliv rance wrought                     X         Yea  blessed shall the man be called       That shames thee of thy evil      And saves me from thy vile attempts
