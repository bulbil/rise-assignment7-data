What taunts and teases me  is the requisition of appearing before a haughty minister  who may receive me with all the insolence of office  How humiliating to the pride of a Spaniard  And yet it is a measure of necessity  but before the degrading ceremony took place  I wanted to talk it over with you  Sir  said I  do not announce your arrival to the minister  till I have ascertained the nature of the reports to your discredit  for there are few evils without a remedy  Whatever may be your alleged crimes  you will give me leave  if you please  to act in the affair as gratitude and friendship shall dictate  With this assurance  I left him at his inn  and promised to let him hear from me soon   As I had taken no active part in state affairs since the two memorials  in which my eloquence was so signally displayed  I went to look for Carnero  with a view to inquire whether Don Alphonso s government was really taken from him  He answered in the affirmative  but professed not to know the reason  Finding how things stood  I determined to apply at head quarters  and to learn the grounds of grievance from his lordship s own mouth   My spirits were really harassed  so that there was no need of putting on the trappings and the suits of woe  to attract my lord duke s notice  What is the matter  Santillane  said he  as soon as he saw me  I perceive a marked unhappiness on your countenance  and tears just ready to trickle down your cheeks  Has any one behaved ill to you  Tell me  and you shall have your revenge  My lord  answered I  in a melancholy tone  even though my grief would seek to hide itself  it must have vent  my despair is past endurance  The report goes that Don Alphonso is no longer Governor of Valencia  a severer stroke could not have been inflicted on me  What say you  Gil Blas  replied the minister in astonishment  what interest can you take in this Don Alphonso and his government  On this question  I detailed at length my obligations to the Lords of Leyva  and modestly stated my own interference with the Duke of Lerma  to obtain the appointment for my friend   When his excellency had heard me through with the most polite and kind attention  he spoke thus  Make yourself easy  Gil Blas  Besides my entire ignorance of what you have just told me  I must own that I considered Don Alphonso as the cardinal s creature  Only put yourself in my place  was not the visit to his eminence a most suspicious circumstance  Yet I am willing to believe that owing his preferment to that minister  he might have remembered him in his adversity from a motive of pure gratitude  I am sorry for having displaced a man who owed his elevation to you  but if I have pulled down your handiwork I can build it up again  I mean to do still more than the Duke of Lerma for you  Your friend Don Alphonso was only Governor of Valencia  I appoint him Viceroy of Arragon  you may send him word so yourself  and order him hither to take the oaths  At these words  my feelings changed from extreme grief to an excess of joy  which completely caricatured the mediocrity of common sense  and made me utter an incoherent rhapsody of thanks  but the want of method in the madness of my discourse was not taken amiss  and on my hinting that Don Alphonso was already at Madrid  he told me that I might present him this very day  I ran to the sign of Saint Gabriel  and communicated my own raptures to Don Caesar s son  by informing him of his new appointment  He could not believe what I told him  but found it a hard matter to persuade himself  that the prime minister  though likely enough to be very well disposed towards me  should attend his friendship so far as to dispose of viceroyalties at my instance  I carried him with me to my lord duke  who received him very affably  complimented him on his uniform good conduct in his government of Valencia  and finished by saying that the king  considering him as qualified for a higher station  had named him for the viceroyalty of Arragon  Besides  added he  your family is of a rank not to disparage the dignity of the office  so that the Arragonese nobility will have no plea for excepting against the choice of the court   His excellency made no mention of me  and the public was kept in the dark as to my share in the business  indeed  this prudent silence was lucky both for Don Alphonso and the minister  since the tongues of defamers would have been busy in taking to pieces the pretensions of a viceroy who owed his preferment to my patronage   As soon as Don Caesar s son could speak with certainty of his new honours  he sent off an express for Valencia with the information to his father and Seraphina  who soon arrived in Madrid  Their first object was to find me out  and ply me thick and threefold with acknowledgments  What a proud and affecting sight for me  to behold
