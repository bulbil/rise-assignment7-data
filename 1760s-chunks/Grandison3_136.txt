balm of a friendly and grateful heart would promote the cure  I have urged it before  Consider of it   My Grandison  my dear Grandison  my friend  my preserver  You are not going —  I am  my Jeronymo  and embraced him  Love me in absence  as I shall you   Chevalier  said the Bishop you don t go  We hope for your company at a small collation—We must not part with you yet     339 I cannot  my Lord  accept the favour  Altho  I had given myself up to despair of obtaining the happiness to which I once aspired  yet I was not willing to quit a city that this family had made dear to me  with the precipitation of a man conscious of misbehaviour  I thank you for the permission I had to attend you all in full assembly  May God prosper you  my Lord  and may you be invested with the first honours of that church which must be adorned by so worthy a heart  It will be my glory  when I am in my native place  or where ever I am  to remember that I was once thought not unworthy of a rank in a family so respectable  Let me  my Lord  be intitled to your kind remembrance   He pulled out his handkerchief  My Lord  said he  to his father  My Lord  to the General  Grandison must not go —and sat down with emotion   Lady Sforza wept  Laurana seemed moved  The two young Lords Sebastino and Juliano  were greatly affected   I then addressed myself to the Marquis  who sat undetermined  as to speech  My venerable Lord  forgive me  that my address was not first paid here  My heart overflows with gratitude for your goodness in permitting me to throw myself at your feet  before I took a last farewel of a city favoured with your residence  Best of fathers  of friends  of men  let me entreat the continuance of your paternal indulgence to the child nearest  and deserving to be nearest▪ to your heart  She is all you and her mother  Restore her to yourself  and to her  by your indulgence  That alone  and a blessing on your prayers  can restore her  Adieu  my good Lord  Repeated thanks for all your hospitable goodness to a man that will ever retain a grateful sense of your favour   You will not yet go  was all he said—He seemed in agitation  He could not say more   I then  turning to the Count his brother  who sat   340 next him  said  I have had not the honour to be fully known to your Lordship  Some prejudices from differences in opinion may have been conceived  But if you ever hear any thing of the man befoore you unworthy of his name  and of the favour once designed him  then  my Lord  blame as well as wonder at  the condescension of your noble brother and sister in my favour   Who  I  Who I  said that Lord  in some hurry —I think very well of you  I never saw a man  in my life  that I liked so well   Your Lordship does me honour  I say this the rather  as I may  on this solemn occasion  taking leave of such honourable friends  charge my future life with resolutions to behave worthy of the favour I have met with in this family   I passed from him to the General—Forgive  my Lord  said I  the seeming formality of my behaviour in this parting scene  It is a very solemn one to me  You have expressed yourself of me  and to me  my Lord  with more passion  Forgive me  I mean not to offend you  than perhaps you will approve in yourself when I am far removed from Italy  For have you not a noble mind  And are you not a son of the Marquis della Porretta  Permit me to observe  that passion will make a man exalt himself  and degrade another  and the just medium will be then forgot  I am afraid I have been thought more lightly of  than I ought to be  either in justice  or for the honour of a person who is dear to every one present  My country was once mentioned with disdain  Think not my vanity so much concerned in what I am going to say  as my honour  I am proud to be thought an Englishman  Yet I think as highly of every worthy man of every nation under the sun  as I do of the worthy men of my own  I am not of a contemptible race in my own country  My father lives in it with the magnificence of a prince    341 He loves his son  yet I presume to add  that that son deems his good name his riches  his integrity his grandeur  Princes  tho  they are intitled by their rank to respect  are princes to him only as they act   A few words more  my Lord   I have been of the hearing  not of the speaking side of the question  in the two last conferences I had the honour to hold with your
