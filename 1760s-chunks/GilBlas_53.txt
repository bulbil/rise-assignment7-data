the grinders  whence it was to encounter the process of digestion  Nevertheless  easy as was their passage  he was not for stopping the way with too much of them  and  to be sure  he was in the right  But though he cautioned the maid and me against repletion in respect of solids  it was made up by free permission to drink as much water as we liked  Far from prescribing us any limits there  he would tell us sometimes    Drink  my children  health consists in the pliability and moisture of the parts  Drink water by pails full  it is a universal dissolvent  water liquefies all the salts  Is the course of the blood a little sluggish  this grand principle sets it forward  too rapid  its career is checked  Our doctor was so orthodox on this head  that he drank nothing himself but water  though advanced in years  He defined old age to be a natural consumption which dries us up and wastes us away  on this principle  he deplored the ignorance of those who call wine old men s milk  He maintained that wine wears them out and corrodes them  and pleaded with all the force of eloquence against that liquor  fatal in common both to the young and old  that friend with a serpent in its bosom  that pleasure with a dagger under its girdle   In spite of these fine arguments  at the end of a week a looseness ensued  with some twinges  which I was blasphemous enough to saddle on the universal dissolvent  and the new  fashioned diet  I stated my symptoms to my master  in the hope he would relax the rigour of his regimen  and qualify my meals with a little wine  but his hostility to that liquor was inflexible  If you have not philosophy enough  said he  for pure water  there are innocent infusions to strengthen the stomach against the nausea of aqueous quaffings  Sage  for example  has a very pretty flavour  and if you wish to heighten it into a debauch  it is only mixing rosemary  wild poppy  and other simples  but no compounds   In vain did he crack off his water  and teach me the secret of composing delicious messes  I was so abstemious  that  remarking my moderation  he said    In good sooth  Gil Blas  I marvel not that you are no better than you are  you do not drink enough  my friend  Water taken in a small quantity serves only to separate the particles of bile and set them in action  but our practice is to drown them in a copious drench  Fear not  my good lad  lest a superabundance of liquid should either weaken or chill your stomach  far from thy better judgment be that silly fear of unadulterated drink  I will ensure you against all consequences  and if my authority will not serve your turn  read Celsus  That oracle of the ancients makes an admirable panegyric on water  in short  he says in plain terms that those who plead an inconstant stomach in favour of wine  publish a libel on their own bowels  and make their organization a pretence for their sensuality   As it would have been ungenteel in me to have run riot on my entrance into the career of practice  I affected thorough conviction  indeed  I thought there was something in it  I therefore went on drinking water on the authority of Celsus  or  to speak in scientific terms  I began to drown the bile in copious drenches of that unadulterated liquor  and though I felt myself more out of order from day to day  prejudice won the cause against experience  It is evident  therefore  that I was in the right road to the practice of physic  Yet I could not always be insensible to the qualms which increased in my frame  to that degree  as to determine me on quitting Doctor Sangrado  But he invested me with a new office which changed my tone  Hark you  my child  said he to me one day  I am not one of those hard and ungrateful masters  who leave their household to grow grey in service without a suitable reward  I am well pleased with you  I have a regard for you  and without waiting till you have served your time  I will make your fortune  Without more ado  I will initiate you in the healing art  of which I have for so many years been at the head  Other physicians make the science to consist of various unintelligible branches  but I will shorten the road for you  and dispense with the drudgery of studying natural philosophy  pharmacy  botany  and anatomy  Remember  my friend  that bleeding and drinking warm water are the two grand principles  the true secret of curing all the distempers incident to humanity  Yes  this marvellous secret which I reveal to you  and which nature  beyond the reach of my colleagues  has failed in rescuing from my pen  is comprehended in these two articles    namely  bleeding and drenching  Here you have the sum total of my philosophy  you are thoroughly bottomed in medicine  and may raise yourself to the summit of fame on the shoulders of my long experience
