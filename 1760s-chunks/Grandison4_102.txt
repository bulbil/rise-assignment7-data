 They were so stiff with the bastinado they had met with  that they were unable to help themselves  Mr  Merceda had been more severely  I cannot call it more cruelly  treated than the other  for he  it seems  was the greatest malefactor in the attempt made upon   254 the Lady  And he had  besides  two or three gashes  which  but for his struggles  would have been but one   As you  my dear  always turn pale when the word Masquerade is mentioned  so  I warrant  will ABBEVILLE be a word of terror to these wretches  as long as they live   Their enemies  it seems  carried off their arms  perhaps  in the true spirit of French chivalry  with a view to lay them  as so many trophies  at the feet of the insulted Lady   Mr  Lowther writes  that my brother and he are lodged in the Hôtel of a man of quality  a dear friend of the late Mr Danby  and one of the three whom he has remembered in his will  and that Sir Charles is extremely busy in relation to the executorship  and  having not a moment to spare  desired Mr  Lowther to engage his friend  to whom he wrote  to let us know as much  and that he was hastening every thing for his journey onwards   Mr  Beauchamp s narrative of this affair  is  as I told you  very circumstantial  I thought to have shortened it more than I have done  I wish I have not made my abstract confused  in several material places  But I have not time to clear it up  Adieu  my dear   CHARLOTTE G   LETTER XXXVII  Lady G  To Miss BYRON    Sunday  May 7   I Believe I shall become as arrant a scribbler as Somebody else  I begin to like writing  A great compliment to you  I assure you  I see one may bring one s mind to any thing—I thought I must have   255 had recourse  when you and my brother left us  and when I was married  to the publick amusements  to fill up my leisure  And as I have seen every thing worth seeing of those  many times over  masquerades excepted  and them I despise   time  you know  in that case  would have passed a little heavily  after having shown myself  and  by seeing Who and Who were together  laid in a little store of the right sort of conversation for the tea table  For you know  Harriet  that among us modern fine people  the company  and not the entertainment  is the principal part of the Raree show  Pretty enough  to make the entertainment  and pay for it too  to the honest fellows  who have nothing to do  but to project schemes to get us together   I don t know what to do with this man  I little thought that I was to be considered as such a Doll  such a Toy  as he would make me  I want to drive him out of the house without me  were it but to purvey for me news and scandal  What are your fine gentlemen sit for else  You know  that  with all my faults  I have a domestic and managing turn  A man should encourage that in a wife  and not be perpetually teazing her for her company abroad  unless he did it with a view to keep her at home  Our Sex don t love to be prescribed to  even in the things to which they are not naturally averse  And for this very reason  perhaps  because it becomes us to submit to prescription  Human nature  Harriet  is a perverse thing  I believe  if my good man wished me to stay at home  I should torture my brain  as other good wives do  for inventions to go abroad   It was but yesterday  that  in order to give him a hint  I pinned my apron to his coat  without considering who was likely to be a sufferer by it  and be  getting up  in his usual nimble way  gave it a rent  and then looked behind him with so much apprehension—Hands folded  eyes goggling  bag in motion   256 from shoulder to shoulder  I was vexed too much to make the use of the trick which I had designed  and huffed him  He made excuses  and looked pitifully  bringing in his Soul  to testify that he knew not how it could be—How it could be  Wretch  When you are always squatting upon one s cloaths  in defiance of hoop  or distance   He went out directly  and brought me in two aprons  either of which was worth twenty of that he so carelesly rent  Who could be angry with him —I was  indeed  thinking to chide him for this—As if I were not to be trusted to buy my own cloaths  And it was just at my tongue s end  to ask him  What the milaner could think of a man buying linen for a woman  but he looked at me with so good natured an eye
