 or appetite  and dressing herself in the dark  suddenly appeared before them to the no small perturbation of both  Timothy  in particular  was so startled  that  in his endeavours to make a hasty retreat towards the chimney corner  he overturned the table  the liquor was spilt  but the bowl was saved by falling on a heap of ashes  Mrs  Cook having reprimanded him for his foolish fear  declared  she had got up betimes  in order to scour her saucepans  and the captain proposed to have the bowl replenished  if materials could be procured  This difficulty was overcome by Crabshaw  and they sat down with their new associate to discuss the second edition   The knight s sudden disappearing being brought upon the carpet  their female companion gave it as her opinion  that nothing would be so likely to bring this affair to light  as going to a cunning man  whom she had lately consulted about a silver spoon that was mislaid  and who told her all the things that she ever did  and ever would happen to her through the whole course of her life   Her two companions pricked up their ears at this intelligence  and Crowe asked if the spoon had been found  She answered in the affirmative  and said the cunning man described to a hair the person that should be her true lover  and her wedded husband  that he was a seafaring man  that he was pretty well stricken in yearsâ€”a little passionate or so  and that he went with his fingers clinched like  as it were  The captain began to sweat at this description  and mechanically thrust his hands into his pockets  while Crabshaw pointing to him  told her he believed she had got the right sow by the ear  Crowe grumbled  that mayhap for all that he should not be brought up by such a grappling neither  Then he asked if this cunning man dealt with the devil  declaring  in that case  he would keep clear of him  for why  because he must have sold himself to Old Scratch  and  being a servant of the devil  how could he be a good subject to his majesty  Mrs  Cook assured him  the conjurer was a good Christian  and that he gained all his knowledge by conversing with the stars and planets  Thus satisfied  the two friends resolved to consult him as soon as it should be light  and being directed to the place of his habitation  set out for it by seven in the morning   They found the house forsaken  and had already reached the end of the lane in their return  when they were accosted by an old woman  who gave them to understand  that if they had occasion for the advice of a fortune teller  as she did suppose they had  from their stopping at the house where Dr  Grubble lived  she would conduct them to a person of much more eminence in that profession  at the same time she informed them  that the said Grubble had been lately sent to Bridewell  a circumstance which  with all his art  he had not been able to foresee  The captain  without any scruple  put himself and his companion under convoy of this beldame  who  through many windings and turnings  brought them to the door of a ruinous house  standing in a blind alley  which door having opened with a key drawn from her pocket  she introduced them into a parlour  where they saw no other furniture than a naked bench  and some frightful figures on the bare walls  drawn or rather scrawled with charcoal   Here she left them locked in  until she should give the doctor notice of their arrival  and they amused themselves with decyphering these characters and hieroglyphics  The first figure that engaged their attention was that of a man hanging upon a gibbet  which both considered as an unfavourable omen  and each endeavoured to avert from his own person  Crabshaw observed  that the figure so suspended was clothed in a sailor s jacket and trowsers  a truth which the captain could not deny  but  on the other hand  he affirmed  that the said figure exhibited the very nose and chin of Timothy  together with the hump on one shoulder  A warm dispute ensued  and being maintained with much acrimonious altercation  might have dissolved the new cemented friendship of those two originals  had it not been interrupted by the old sibyl  who  coming into the parlour  intimated that the doctor waited for them above  She likewise told them  that he never admitted more than one at a time  This hint occasioned a fresh contest  The captain insisted upon Crabshaw s making sail a head  in order to look out afore  but Timothy persisted in refusing this honour  declaring he did not pretend to lead  but he would follow  as in duty bound  The old gentlewoman abridged the ceremony by leading out Crabshaw with one hand  and locking up Crowe with the other   The former was dragged upstairs like a bear to the stake  not without reluctance and terror  which did not at all abate at sight of the conjurer  with whom he was immediately shut up by his conductress  after she had told him in a whisper
