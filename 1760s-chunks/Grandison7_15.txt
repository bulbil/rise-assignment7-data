are the world to me  These obligations of ceremony  tho  unavoidable  are drawbacks upon the true domestic felicity  One happiness  however  results from the hurry and bustle they put us in  Emily s mind  tho  she not always accompanies us  seems to be engaged  When we are not quite happy in our own thoughts  it is a relief to carry them out of ourselves   SIR Charles and I have just now had a short conversation about this dear girl  We both joined in praising her  and then I said  I thought  that some time hence Mr  Beauchamp and she would make a vary happy pair   I have  said he  a Love for both  But as the one is my own very particular friend  and as the other is my ward  I would rather he found for himself  and she for herself  another Lover  and that for obvious reasons   But  suppose  Sir  they should like each the other   So as they made it not a compliment to me  but gave me reason to believe  that they would have preferred each the other to every one else  were they strangers to me  I would not stand in their way  But the man  who hopes for my consent for Emily  must give me reason to think  that he would have preferred her to any other woman  tho  she had a much less fortune than she is mistress of     38 I am much mistaken  Sir  if that may not be the case of your friend   Tell me  my nobly frank  and ever amiable Harriet  what you know of this subject  Has Beauchamp any thoughts of Emily —  Ah  Sir  thought I  I dare not tell you all my thoughts  but what I do tell you  shall be truth   I really  Sir  don t imagine Emily has a thought of your Beauchamp—  Nor of any other person  Has she —  Lady G  Lady L  and myself  are of opinion  that Beauchamp loves Emily   I am glad  my dear  if any thing were to come of it  that the man loved first   I was conscious  A tear unawares dropt from my eye—He saw it  He solded his arm about me  and kissed it from my check  Why  my Love  my dearest Love  why this  and seemed surprised   I must tell you  Sir  that you may not be surprised  I fear  I fear—  What fears m• Love   That the happiest of all women cannot say  that her dear man loved her first —  He folded me in his kind arms  How sweetly engaging  said he  I will presume to hope  that my Harriet  by the happiest of all women  means herself—You say not no  I will not insult your goodness so much  as to ask you to say yes  But  this I say  that the happiest of all men loved his Harriet  before she could love him  and  but for the honour he owed to another admirable woman  tho  then he had no hopes of ever calling her his  would have convinced her of it  by a very early declaration  Let me add  that the moment I saw you first  distressed and terrified as you were  too much to think of favour to any man  I loved you  And you know not the struggle it cost me  my destiny with our dear Clementina so uncertain  to conceal my Love—Cost me  who ever   39 was punctiliously studious to avoid engaging a young Lady s affections  lest I should not be able to be just to her  and always thought what is called Platonic Love an insidious pretension   O Sir  And I flung my fond arms about his neck  and  hiding my glowing face in his bosom  called him  murmuringly  the most just  the most generous  of men   He pressed me still to his heart  and when I raised my conscious face  tho  my eye could not bear his  Now  Sir  said I  after this kind  this encouraging acknowlegement  I can consent  I think I can  that the Lord of my heart shall see  as he has more than once wished to see  long before he declared himself  all that was in that forward  that aspiring heart —  Lucy had furnished me with the opportunity before  I instantly arose  and took out of a drawer a parcel of my Letters  which I had sorted ready  on occasion  to oblige h m  which  from what he had seen before  down to the dreadful masquerade affair  carried me to my setting out with his sisters to Colnebrook   I think not to show him farther  by my own consent  because of the recapitulation of his family story  which immediately follows  particularly includeing the affecting accounts of his mother s death  his father s unkindness to the two young Ladies  Mrs  Oldham s story  the sisters conduct to her  which might have revived disagreeable subjects   Be pleased  Sir  said I
