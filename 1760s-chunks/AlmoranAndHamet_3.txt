wisdom  to him nature had revealed   herself in the silence of the night  when his lamp was burning alone    and his eyes only were open  to him was known the power of the Seal of   Solomon  and to him the knowlege of things invisible had been revealed    Nor was the virtue of OMAR inferior to his knowlege  his heart was a   fountain of good  which though it flowed through innumerable streams was   never dry  yet was the virtue of OMAR cloathed with humility  and he was   still pressing nearer to perfection  by a devotion which though elevated   was rational  and though regular was warm  From the council of OMAR    Solyman had derived glory and strength  and to him he had committed the   education of his children       When he entered the apartment  the croud  touched at once with reverence   and love  drew back  every eye was cast downward  and every tongue was   silent  The full of days approached the king  and kneeling before him he   put into his hand a sealed paper  the king received it with impatience    seeing it superscribed with the hand of his father  and OMAR looking   round  and perceiving HAMET  beckoned him to come forward  HAMET  whose   obedience to OMAR had been so long habitual that it was now almost   spontaneous  instantly drew near  though with a flow and irresolute   pace  and ALMORAN  having broken the seal of the paper  began to read it   to himself  with a look that expressed the utmost anxiety and   impatience  OMAR kept his eye fixed upon him  and soon perceived that   his countenance was disfigured by confusion and trouble  and that he   seemed preparing to put up the paper in his bosom  he then produced   another paper from under his robe  and gave it to HAMET   This   says   he  is a copy of the will of Solyman  your father  the original is in   the hand of ALMORAN  read it  and you will find that he has bequeathed   his kingdom between you        The eyes of all present were now turned upon HAMET  who stood silent and   motionless with amazement  but was soon roused to attention by the   homage that was paid him  In the mean time  ALMORAN S confusion   increased every moment  his disappointment was aggravated by the sudden   attention of those who were present to his brother  and his jealousy   made him think himself neglected  while those acts of duty were   performed to HAMET  which were now known to be his right  and which he   had himself received before him       HAMET  however  regarded but little what so much excited the envy of   ALMORAN  his mind was employed upon superior objects  and agitated by   nobler passions  the coldness of his brother s behaviour  though it had   grieved had not quenched his affection  and as he was now no longer   restrained by the deference due from a subject to his king  he ran to   him  and catching him to his breast attempted to speak  but his heart   was too full  and he could express his affection and joy only by his   tears  ALMORAN rather suffered than received the embrace  and after a   few ceremonies  to which neither of them could much attend  they retired   to separate apartments                CHAP  II          When ALMORAN was alone  he immediately locked the door  and throwing   himself upon a sofa in an agony of vexation and disapointment  of which   he was unwilling there should be any witness  he revolved in his mind   all the pleasures and honours of supreme dominion which had now suddenly   been snatched from him  with a degree of anguish and regret  not   proportioned to their real  but their imaginary value  Of future good    that which we obtain is found to be less than our expectations  but that   of which we are disappointed  we suppose would have been more  thus do   the children of hope extract evil  both from what they gain  and from   what they lose  But ALMORAN  after the first tumult of his mind had   subsided  began to consider as well what was left him  as what had been   taken away  He was still without a superior  though he had an equal  he   was still a king  though he did not govern alone  and with respect to   every individual in his dominions  except one  his will would now be a   law  though with respect to the public  the concurrence of his brother   would be necessary to give it force   Let me then
