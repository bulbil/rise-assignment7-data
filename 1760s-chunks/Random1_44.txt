I looked upon as no small honour  considering the figure he made  for he was dressed in a blue frock with a gold button  a green silk waistcoat trimmed with gold  black velvet breeches  white silk stockings  silver buckles  a gold laced hat  a spencer wig  and a silver hilted hanger  with a fine clouded cane in his hand —   I perceive  says he  you are but lately come from Scotland —pray what may your business with Mr  Cringer be —I suppose it is no secret—and I may possibly give you some advice that will be serviceable  for I have been surgeon s second mate on board of a seventy gun ship  and consequently know a good deal of the world  —  I made no scruple to disclose my situation  which when he had learned  he shook his head  and told me he had been pretty much in the same circumstances about a year ago  that he had relied on Cringer s promises   119 so long  that his money  which was considerable  as well as his credit  was quite exhausted  and when he wrote to his relations for a fresh supply  instead of money  he received nothing but reproaches  and the epithets of idle  debauched fellow  That after he had waited at the Navy Office many months for a warrant  to no purpose  he was fain to pawn some of his cloaths  which raised him a small sum  wherewith he bribed the s—t—y  who soon procured a warrant for him  notwithstanding he had affirmed the same day  that there was not one vacancy —That he had gone on board  where he remained nine months  at the end of which the ship was put out of commission  and the company to be paid off in Broad street the very next day —That his relations being reconcil d to him  had charg d him to pay his devoirs regularly to Mr  Cringer  who had informed them by letter  that his interest alone had procured the warrant  in obedience to which command  he came to his levee every morning as I saw  though he looked upon him to be a very pitiful scoundrel—In conclusion  he asked me if I had yet passed at Surgeon s Hall  To which I answered  I did not so much as know it was necessary—   Necessary   cried he  O lord  O lord  I find I must instruct you—come along with me  and I ll give you some information about that matter  —  So saying  he carried me into an ale house  where he called for some beer and bread and cheese  on which we breakfasted  While we sat in this place  he told me I must first go to the Navy Office  and write to the board  desiring them to order a letter for me to the Surgeon s Hall  that I may be examined touching my skill in surgery  That the Surgeons    120 after having examined me  would give me my qualification sealed up in form of a letter directed to the commissioners  which qualification I must deliver to the secretary of the board  who would open it in my presence  and read the contents  After which  I must employ my interest to be provided for as soon as possible—That the expence of his qualification for second mate of a third rate  amounted to thirteen shillings  exclusive of the warrant  which cost him half a guinea and half a crown  besides the present to the secretary  which consisted of a three pound twelve piece —This calculation was like a thunder bolt to me  whose whole fortune did not amount to twelve shillings—I accordingly made him acquainted with this part of my distress  after having thanked him for his information and advice —He condoled with me on this occasion  but bid me be of good chear  for he had conceived a friendship for me  and would make all things easy — Tis true he was run out at present  but to morrow or next day  he was certain of receiving a considerable sum  of which he would lend me what would be sufficient to answer my exigences  This frank declaration pleased me so much  that I pulled out my purse and emptied it before him  begging him to take what he pleased for pocket expence until he should receive his own money —With a good deal of pressing he was prevailed upon to take five shillings  telling me that he might have what money he pleased at any time  for the trouble of going into the city  but as he had met with me  he would deser his going thither till to morrow  when I should go along with him  and he would put me in a way of acting for myself  without a servile dependance   121 on that rascal Cringer  much less on the lousy taylor to whom I heard him turn you over —   How  cried I  is Mr  Staytape a taylor  —   No less  I ll assure you  answer d he  and I confess  more likely to serve you than the member  For provided you can entertain him with politics and conundrums  you may have credit with him for as many and as rich cloaths as you please  —  I told him
