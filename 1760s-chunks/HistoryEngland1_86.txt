the Pope  or they who followed Luther  were equally the objects of royal vengeance and ecclesiastical persecution  Thomas Cromwell  raised by the King s caprice from a blacksmith s son to be a royal favourite  for tyrants ever raise their favourites from the lowest of the people  and Cranmer  now become Archbishop of Cauterbury  with all their might  assisted the reformation  Bishop Gardiner   252 and the Duke of Norfolk  on the other hand  were for leading the King back to his former superstitions  with every art  and Cromwell fell a sacrifice to their intrigues  but the Duke and Bishop did not succeed  Unhappily for his subjects  the King became an equal persecutor of the two religions proposed for his acceptance   It was now that England saw a spectacle to strike the boldest with horror  a company of people condemned and executed all together  some for being stedfast to the Pope  and others for adhering to Luther  among this number were Dr  Robert Barnes  Thomas Gerard  and William Jerom  for being Lutherans  Buttolph  Danepliss  Philpot  and Brinholm  for continuing to acknowledge the Pope  These were all burnt together  without ever being permitted to plead their own cause  or even to know their crimes or their accusers  The people in the North  indeed  during these times of cruelty  ventured to rise in rebellion  but by the means of the Duke of Norfolk they were soon brought to a submission   During these transactions Henry contracted a new marriage with Anne of Cleves  being induced by her picture  in which it seems the painter had flattered her  He found her very different from what his passion had expected  but married her from political motives  He could not  however  long bear the uneasiness of being married for life to a woman  whose corpulence  it seems  gave him disgust  he therefore resolved to have once more a divorce from his parliament  which he found it no difficult matter to obtain  Among other reasons to cancel his espousals  he declared  that he had not given an inward consent to the marriage  without which it was affirmed that his   253 promises could not be obligatory  he added  that  as he was resolved not to consummate the marriage  and to have legitimate issue  so it was proper to give him a Queen by whom he might accomplish these intentions  These reasons were thought good  virtue and justice had been long banished from the servile parliament   He took  for a fifth wife  Catharine Howard  the Duke of Norfolk s niece  in this match he seemed to be perfectly happy  and even ordered his confessor to draw up a particular form of thanksgiving  for the blessings he enjoyed in a faithful wife  The Queen  it seems  pretended to the same affection for him  but  alas  his amiable days were long over  he was now almost choaked with fat  and had contracted a morose air  very improper for inspiring affection  the Queen had actually committed those lewdnesses before marriage  of which Anna Bullen had formerly been falsly accused  But those crimes did by no means deserve death  nor even a divorce  since her fidelity to him  since marriage  was all that the most scrupulous delicacy could require  Henry  however  considered her former inconstancy as a capital offence  and  not yet satiated with blood  this Queen was executed on Tower hill  All this was terrible  but still the King was resolved to be peculiarly cruel  though branded with three divorces  and stained with the blood of two wives  he ordered a law to be enacted  equally remarkable for its absurdity and impossibility  namely    That  whatever person knew of the intrigues of a Queen  he should reveal it upon pain of high treason  or if any woman  not a virgin  should presume to marry the King of England  she should be guilty of high treason   One would think that it were impossible to procure a   254 body of men capable of giving sanction to such inscrutable absurdities  and yet lay claim to reason  It was pleasantly said  for even those times of slaughter could not suppress ridicule  that the King  according to that statute  could only marry a widow  His next and last wife actually was a widow  Catharine Parr  widow of Lord Latimer  and she was a favourer of the reformation     She was  however  to proceed with great caution  the King prided himself much on his skill in theology  and it might be fatal to dispute with him upon religion  as she had seen in the case of one Lambert  some time before  It seems this man had denied transubstantiation  which Henry had ordered to be believed  the King  hearing that he was to be tried at Westminster for this offence  which was capital  undertook  himself  to dispute the point with him in public  Letters were written to many of the Bishops and Nobility to be present upon this extraordinary occasion  and  on the …ay prefixed  〈◊〉 was a great concourse in the …ll  Lambert …od alone without a second  the King was s…rounded with a crowd of flatterers  who applauded all
