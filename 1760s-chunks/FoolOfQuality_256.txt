bed  and turned away   his face  and would eat no bread       Here we see that the people of Israel had so far recovered their   originally inherent and hereditary rights  that the regal estate had   not the privilege of wresting from any subject so much as an herb   garden      This was a mortifying circumstance to royal elevation  but power   is seldom unfruitful of expedients  A method was found of rending   away Naboth s property  without his consent  under colour of the   law to which he had consented  He was falsely impeached  and   forfeited his life and inheritance together  But God  by the signal   punishment which he inflicted for this breach on the natural rights   of his people  evinced to the world how dear they are in the eye of   eternal justice      How deplorable  then  my Harry  is the suppression of these   rights  now nearly universal throughout the earth   But when   people  from their infancy  and from generation to generation  have   been habituated to bondage  oppression  and submission  without   any tradition or memorial delivered down to them of a happier or   more equitable manner of life   they are accustomed to look on   themselves  their possessions  and their progeny  as the rightful   property of their rulers  to be disposed of at pleasure   and they no   more regret the want of Liberty that they never knew  than the   blind born regret the want of the light of the sun      Before I give you this paper that I have in my hand  this epitome   or picture  in miniature  of the incomparable beauties of the Bri    tannic constitution  it may be requisite to premise a few matters      Travellers  when they survey a grand Egyptian pyramid  are apt   to inquire by whom the stupendous pile was erected  and how long   it hath stood the assaults of time  But when nothing of this can   be developed  imagination runs back through antiquity without   bounds  and thence contemplates an object with peculiar venera    tion  that appears as it were to have had no beginning      Such a structure is the constitution of Great Britain   No records   discover when it had a commencement  neither can any annals   specify the time at which it was not      William the Norman  above seven hundred years ago  on his   entering into the original contract with the people  engaged to   govern them according to the bonze et approbate antiquss regni leges    the good  well approved  and ancient laws of the kingdom  this   constitution was therefore ancient  even in ancient times      More than eighteen hundred years are now elapsed since Julius   Csesar  in the sixth book of his Commentaries  bore testimony as   well to the antiquity as excellency of the system of the laws of   Britain  He tells us that the venerable order of the Druids  who   then administered justice throughout Gaul  derived their system of   government from Britain   and that it was customary for those   who were desirous of being versed in the said ancient institutions   to go over to Britain for that purpose      Caesar seems to recommend  while he specifies  one of the laws   that was then peculiar to the constitution of Britain  He tells you         272 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      that  if a woman was suspected of the death of her husband  she   was questioned thereupon with severity   by her neighbours    and   that  if she was found guilty  she was tied alive to a stake  and   burned to death  The very trial used in Britain    by a jury of   neighbours   to this day      It is hence very obvious that our Gothic ancestors either adopted   what they judged excellent in the British constitution  or rather   superadded what was deemed to be excellent in their own      The people who went under the general name of Goths were of   many different nations  who  from the northern  poured down on the   more southern parts of Europe      Their kings were originally chiefs or generals  appointed to lead   voluntary armies  or colonies  for the forming of new settlements in   foreign lands   and they were followed by a free and independent   multitude  who had previonsly stipulated that they should share and   enjoy the possessions which their valour should conquer      Next to the general in order  the officers or principal men of the   army were attended  on such expeditions  by their kinsfolk  friends    and dependants
