The  other  without lifting up his eyes  or desisting from his endeavours to  loose the knot  which by this time he had applied to his teeth  answered  this question in the negative  observing that the papers in his hand  were the security which he proposed to give for the money  This reply  converted the looks of the inquirer into a stare of infinite solidity   accompanied with the word Anan  which he pronounced in a tone of fear  and astonishment  The other  alarmed at this note  cast his eyes towards  the supposed lender  and was in a moment infected by his aspect  All  the exultation of hope that sparkled in their eyes was now succeeded by  disappointment and dismay  and while they gazed ruefully at each other   their features were gradually elongated  like the transient curls of a  Middle row periwig   This emphatic silence was  however  broken by the last comer  who  in  a faltering accent  desired the other to recollect the contents of his    6 22 15  3 45 PM   letter   Of your letter   cried the first  putting into his hand the  advertisement he had received from Pickle  which he had no sooner  perused  than he produced his own for the satisfaction of the other  party  So that another gloomy pause ensued  at the end of which  each  uttered a profound sigh  or rather groan  and  rising up  sneaked off  without further communication  he who seemed to be the most afflicted of  the two  taking his departure  with an exclamation of  Humbugged  egad    Such were the amusements of our hero  though they did not engross his  whole time  some part of which was dedicated to nocturnal riots and  revels  among a set of young noblemen  who had denounced war against  temperance  economy  and common sense  and were indeed the devoted sons  of tumult  waste  and prodigality  Not that Peregrine relished those  scenes  which were a succession of absurd extravagance  devoid of all  true spirit  taste  or enjoyment  But his vanity prompted him to mingle  with those who are entitled the choice spirits of the age  and his  disposition was so pliable  as to adapt itself easily to the measures of  his company  where he had not influence enough to act in the capacity  of a director  Their rendezvous was a certain tavern  which might be  properly styled the temple of excess  where they left the choice of  their fare to the discretion of the landlord  that they might save  themselves the pains of exercising their own reason  and  in order to  avoid the trouble of adjusting the bill  ordered the waiter to declare  how much every individual must pay  without specifying the articles of  the charge  This proportion generally amounted to two guineas per head  for each dinner and supper  and frequently exceeded that sum  of which  the landlord durst not abate  without running the risk of having his  nose slit for his moderation   But this was puny expense compared with that which they often incurred   by the damage done to the furniture and servants  in the madness of  their intoxication  as well as the loss they sustained at hazard  an  amusement to which all of them had recourse in the progress of their  debauches  This elegant diversion was introduced  encouraged  and  promoted by a crew of rapacious sharpers  who had made themselves  necessary companions to this hopeful generation  by the talents of  pimping and buffoonery  Though they were universally known  even  by those they preyed upon to have no other means of earning their  livelihood  than the most infamous and fraudulent practices  they were  caressed and courted by these infatuated dupes  when a man of honour   who would not join in their excesses  would have been treated with the  utmost indignity and contempt   Though Peregrine  in his heart  detested those abandoned courses   and was a professed enemy to the whole society of gamesters  whom  he considered  and always treated  as the foes of humankind  he was  insensibly accustomed to licentious riot  and even led imperceptibly  into play by those cormorants  who are no less dangerous in the art of  cheating  than by their consummate skill in working up the passions of  unwary youth  They are  for the most part  naturally cool  phlegmatic   and crafty  and  by a long habit of dissimulation  have gained an  absolute dominion over the hasty passions of the heart  so that they  engage with manifest advantage over the impatience and impetuosity of a  warm undesigning temper  like that of our young gentleman  who  when he  was heated with wine  misled by example  invited on one hand  and  defied on the other  forgot all his maxims of caution and sobriety  and   plunging into the reigning folly of the place  had frequent occasions    6 22 15  3 45 PM   to moralize in the morning upon the loss of
