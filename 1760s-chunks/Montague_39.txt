the first day I have ventured in an open carriole  we have been running a race on the snow  your brother and I against Emily and Fitzgerald  we conquered from Fitzgerald s complaisance to Emily  I shall like it mightily  well wrapt up  I set off with a crape over my face to keep off the cold  but in three minutes it was a cake of solid ice  from my breath which froze upon it  yet this is called a mild day  and the sun shines in all his glory   Silleri  Thursday  Jan  8  midnight       We are just come from the general s assembly  much company  and we danced till this minute  for I believe we have not been more coming these four miles       Fitzgerald is the very pink of courtesy  he never uses his covered carriole himself  but devotes it intirely to the ladies  it stands at the general s door in waiting on Thursdays  if any lady comes out before her carriole arrives  the servants call out mechanically   Captain Fitzgerald s carriole here  for a lady   The Colonel is equally gallant  but I generally lay an embargo on his  they have each of them an extreme pretty one for themselves  or to drive a fair lady a morning s airing  when she will allow them the honor  and the weather is mild enough to permit it        Bon soir  I am sleepy   Yours    A  FERMOR     LETTER LI   51   To JOHN TEMPLE  Esq  Pall Mall   Quebec  Jan  9   YOU mistake me extremely  Jack  as you generally do  I have by no means forsworn marriage  on the contrary  though happiness is not so often found there as I wish it was  yet I am convinced it is to be found no where else  and  poor as I am  I should not hesitate about trying the experiment myself to morrow  if I could meet with a woman to my taste  unappropriated  whose ideas of the state agreed with mine  which I allow are something out of the common road  but I must be certain those ideas are her own  therefore they must arise spontaneously  and not in complaisance to mine  for which reason  if I could  I would endeavour to lead my mistress into the subject  and know her sentiments on the manner of living in that state before I discovered my own       I must also be well convinced of her tenderness before I make a declaration of mine  she must not distinguish me because I flatter her  but because she thinks I have merit  those fancied passions  where gratified vanity assumes the form of love  will not satisfy my heart  the eyes  the air  the voice of the woman I love  a thousand little indiscretions dear to the heart  must convince me I am beloved  before I confess I love       Though sensible of the advantages of fortune  I can be happy without it  if I should ever be rich enough to live in the world  no one will enjoy it with greater gust  if not  I can with great spirit  provided I find such a companion as I wish  retire from it to love  content  and a cottage  by which I mean to the life of a little country gentleman        You ask me my opinion of the winter here  If you can bear a degree of cold  of which Europeans can form no idea  it is far from being unpleasant  we have settled frost  and an eternal blue sky  Travelling in this country in winter is particularly agreable  the carriages are easy  and go on the ice with an amazing velocity  though drawn only by one horse       The continual plain of snow would be extremely fatiguing both to the eye and imagination  were not both relieved  not only by the woods in prospect  but by the tall branches of pines with which the road is marked out on each side  and which form a verdant avenue agreably contrasted with the dazzling whiteness of the snow  on which  when the sun shines  it is almost impossible to look steadily even for a moment       Were it not for this method of marking out the roads  it would be impossible to find the way from one village to another       The eternal sameness however of this avenue is tiresome when you go far in one road       I have passed the last two months in the most agreable manner possible  in a little society of persons I extremely love  I feel myself so attached to this little circle of friends  that I have no pleasure in any other company  and think all the time absolutely lost that politeness forces me to spend any where else  I extremely dread our party s being dissolved  and wish the winter to last for ever  for I am afraid the spring will divide us       Adieu  and believe me   Yours    ED  RIVERS     LETTER LII   52   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Silleri  Jan  9
