indulged  if you have not already been indulged enough  in all the pretty circummabages customary on these occasions   Miss Gr  This is charming —But pray  Sir  What is your advice  on this subject   Sir Ch  In our former conversation upon it  I told you what I thought of my Lord s good humour  what of your vivacity—Can you  Charlotte  were you the wife of Lord G  content yourself now and then to make him start  by the lancet like delicacy of your wit  without going deeper than the skin  Without exposing him  and yourself for doing so  to the ridicule of others  Can you bear with his soibles  if he can bear with yours  And if the forbearance is greater on his side  than on yours  can you value him for it  and for his good humour   Miss Gr  Finely run off  upon my word   Sir Ch  I am afraid only  that you will be able  Charlotte  to do what you will with him  I am sorry to have cause to say  that I have seen very good women who have not known how to bear indulgence —Waller was not absolutely wrong  as to such  when he said   that women were born to be controuled   If controul is likely to be necessary  it will be with women of such charming spirits as you know whose    138 Charlotte  who will not confine to time and place their otherwise agreeable vivacities   Miss Gr  Well  but  Sir  if it should chance to be so  and I were Lord G  s upper servant  for controul implies dominion  what a fine advantage would he have in a brother  who could direct him so well  tho  he might still  perhaps  be a bechelor  how to manage a wife so flippant   Sir Ch  Bachelors  Charlotte  are close observers  It is not every married couple  if they were sollicitous to have a bachelor marry  that should admit him into a very close intimacy with themselves   Miss Gr   archly  Pray  Lord L  Did we not once hear our cousin Everard make an observation of this nature   Sir Ch  Fairly retorted  Charlotte —But how came your cousin Everard to make this observation  I once heard you say  that he was but a common observer  Every married pair is not Lord and Lady L   Miss Gr  Well  well  I believe married people must do as well as they can  But may I ask you  brother  Is it owing to such observations as those you have been making  that you are now a single man   Sir Ch  A fair question from you  Charlotte  I answer  It is not   Miss Gr  I should be glad  with all my heart  to know what is   Sir Ch  When the subject comes fairly on the carpet  your curiosity may perhaps be gratified  But tell me  Do you intend that the subject you had engaged Lady L  to introduce  in relation to Lord G  and Sir Walter Watkyns  should be dismissed  at present  I mean not to be peremptory  Charlotte  Be not afraid to answer   Miss Gr  Why that s kind  No  I can t say  that I do  And yet I frankly consess  that I had much rather ask  than answer questions  You know  Sir  that I have a wicked curiosity     139  Sir Ch  Well  Charlotte  you will find me  wicked as you call it  very ready  at a proper time  to gratify it  To some things that you may want to know  in relation to my situation  you needed not now to have been a stranger  had I had the pleasure of being more with you  and had you yourself been as explicit as I would have wished you to be  But the crisis is at hand  When I am certain myself  you shall not be in doubt  I would not suppose  that my happiness is a matter of indifference to my sisters  and if it be not  I should be ungrateful  not to let them know everything I know  that is likely to affect it   See  Lucy  What can be gathered from all this  But yet this speech has a noble sound with it  Don t you think it has  It is  I think  worthy of Sir Charles Grandison  But by what clouds does this sun seem to be obscured  He says  however  that the crisis is at hand —Solemn words  as they strike me  Ah Lucy —But this is my prayer—May the crisis produce happiness to him  let who will be unhappy   Miss Gr  You are always good  noble  uniform—Curiosity  get thee behind me  and lie still —And yet  brother  like a favoured squirrel repulsed  I am afraid it will be soon upon my shoulder  if the crisis be suspended      Crisis is at hand    Lucy —I cannot get over these words  and yet they make my heart ake
