as Mrs Gerrarde can make me  but I assure you  Sir George  I have no designs but what are for the good both of her soul and body  and I have hitherto treated her like a vestal  What a paradox is here  say you  But have patience till I tell you the story of my knight errantry   You are to know then  that as Arnold’s amour with Mrs Gerrarde was no secret at V—— hall  from the moment I heard it  I meditated a design of breaking the detestable union  not out of regard either to him or her  but in hopes of restoring  to the most amiable of women  a besotted husband’s heart  which nothing but downright magic  infernal witchcraft  could have robbed her of  The woman is handsome  ’tis true  but she is a silly toad  and as fantastic as an ape  I had formed this design  I say  from the first notice I had of the intrigue  and  in consequence of this  resolved to renew my acquaintance with Mrs Gerrarde  for I had known her before  known her to my cost  She it was  this identical devil  whom I have now in my power  that was the cause of Miss Burchell’s misfortune  and therefore the remote cause of my losing Miss Bidulph  Had it not been for her  I should never have had the fall of that unhappy girl to answer for  I should not  I say  mark that   for the mercenary witch was determined to sell her to somebody  when my ill stars threw me in her way  I do not rank this affair in the number of capital crimes  and yet I never think of it without a pang  If half of my fortune would retrieve the girl’s peace of mind  I would give it freely  but it is past now  and cannot be helped  She had the good fortune never to be suspected  and  if she keeps her own council  probably never will  If I die a bachelor  as I believe I shall   I will leave her my whole fortune  What can a man do more   How I ramble from my subject  I meant only to tell you what my design was in carrying off Mrs Gerrarde  In order to effect it  as I said before  it was necessary for me to renew my acquaintance with her  and accordingly I put on a bold face  and made her a visit  She was not surprized at this  our former intimacy giving me a sufficient pretence for it  She received me with a pleased familiarity  which convinced me my company was far from being disagreeable to her  and I am sure  had my views been other than they were  I should have met with as kind a reception as my heart could have wished  for she certainly thought of retaining me in her service unknown to Arnold  I was soon aware of this  for  though she often desired to see    me  she always contrived it at such times  as she was sure of not being surprized by him  This was  in some measure  meeting my purpose halfway  but though I wanted to disengage her from Arnold  I did not mean to sacrifice myself to her  and our views  in the material point  were very different  mine were only to part her from her gallant  her’s were to share her favours between us  for she did not intend to let go her hold on him  and I believe my backwardness  in pushing my good fortune  began to disgust her  but the time for carrying my plan into execution was not yet arrived  it could not be till Arnold’s departure from South Park  I meant to carry Mrs Gerrarde away with the appearance of her own consent  and I knew this was impossible  whilst her lover remained so near her  I had formed but a rough sketch of my plan when I received your letter  which summoned me to Sidney Castle  and I resolved not to apprize you of it  till my enterprize was crowned with success  more especially as you were then quite ignorant of your sister’s wrongs   On my return from visiting you  the first news I heard at V—— hall was  that Mr Arnold and his lady were parted  I curst my own dilatoriness  that I had not executed my plan before things were brought to such extremities  for I well knew it was that artful fiend who had occasioned it  though I then little thought how fatally I had contributed towards the misfortune of the ever amiable and most respectable of women   Lady V—— told me  that your sister  having discovered her husband’s infidelity  had left him on that account  but my lord soon let me into the whole secret  Oh  Sir George  that angel  who deserved the first monarch in the universe  to be cast off by an undiscerning dolt  and I  though innocently  the accursed cause  I cannot think with patience of what the divine creature has suffered on my account  but was it not all  from the beginning  owing to Mrs Gerrarde  that avenging fury  sent on earth as a scourge for the sins of me
