all the mysteries of a courtezan  and she had the satisfaction to find  that her sister proved a very apt scholar  When she imagined her sufficiently qualified  she resolved to set her up in business  in a manner which should at the first set her above the common level of those ladies whose bread depends on their beautiful persons  and to that end hired a very handsome house in Northumberland street  most elegantly furnished  she supplied her with the handsomest clothes her wardrobe afforded  gave her a very handsome gold watch  and made her a present of a bank note of fifty pounds   Thus equipped  Miss ELLIOT S sister began to live in great splendor  and by following the directions given her for her conduct  soon had the satisfaction of seeing herself surrounded by many lovers  who were all of them persons whose purses were as open to her extravagant demands  as their hearts were to her transcendent   76 beauty  She was completely blessed  but  alas  she was ignorant of her great happiness  which caused it to be of very short duration   There was a French hair dresser  who lived in the Strand  and who being often sent for to contribute what he could to set her off to the best advantage  had sometimes ventured to express his passion for her  at the same time lamenting that the meanness of his profession debarred him from the hope of ever arriving at the supreme happiness of enjoying her sweet person  She listened to his bombastic oratory with a pleasure which it was out of her power to conceal  and he catching the opportunity  pressed her so hard  that unable any longer to resist  she consented  and Mons  Frizeur from that hour redoubled his former diligence in attending on her  and there scarce passed a day on which they were not privately together   Miss ELLIOT was soon acquainted with the intrigue her sister carried on with the French barber  it excited her indignation to the highest degree  she sent for her sister    77 and when she came  reproached her in the severest terms  for the mean spirit she betrayed in admitting to her embraces so abject a wretch as Frizeur  and forbade her  on pain of her irreconcileable hatred  ever to see him again   Miss ELLIOT S sister  who trembled at the thoughts of incurring her benefactress s displeasure  promised never more to admit of his visits  though  as she was so passionately in love with him  she was distracted to think she must never see him more  and therefore employed her thoughts to find out a way of seeing him unknown to our heroine  In this she succeeded even beyond her wishes for some time  till at length her amour with the barber became so public as to reflect even shame and scandal on herself and her sister  Miss ELLIOT then tried every method her prudence could suggest to break off their intimacy  but to little purpose  for her sister  whose passion for monsieur was unconquerable  having previously disposed of all her furniture  clothes  and every other valuable thing given to her by our heroine  decamped with her lover  to the   78 no small grief of her sister  who found herself under the necessity of making good to the landlord the loss of his goods  which had been sold to raise the money necessary for the elopement of Miss ELLIOT S sister with the Frenchman   Our heroine  who was of that happy turn of mind  that nothing could long give her uneasiness  soon forgot this unlucky affair  and reassumed her gaiety  Her lover was fond of her to distraction  and she took care by the practice of all those endearing arts of which the fair sex are so well furnished  to encrease the love he had for her  Thus they continued happy beyond description in the possession of each other for about two years  when Miss ELLIOT  by a most unpardonable act of imprudence  incurred the displeasure of the commodore so much  that he ordered her to leave his house in the most abrupt manner  and could never be prevailed on to have any other connexions with her   H—y s valet de chambre  a fellow of a good person and genteel address  had long aspired to the honour of being enrolled   79 in the list of her admirers  he sighed in vain many times to taste the ambrosial nectar  which distilled from her coral lips  and he never attended in her apartment to dress her hair  which was his daily occupation  but he experienced the flame of love burning in his breast with so much the more impetuosity  as he was obliged to keep it pent up without betraying the least sign of it  for fear of a repulse from the cruel fair  who  perhaps enraged at his presumption  might have told the commodore  and he thereby have been discharged from his place  In this however he was mistaken  for Miss ELLIOT  whose firmest principle was  that variety is the soul of pleasure  seeing his distress  kindly relieved his pain  by telling him she was resolved to reward his passion with a suitable return of love  and from that hour  they often enjoyed each others company when her keeper was absent   This agreeable correspondence however did not long subsist
