fool   said he  stamping with extreme vexation   or of a vicious   inclination  her conduct would leave no room for wonder  But for a girl    who wants neither wit nor virtue  to expose herself in this manner  has   something in it inconsistent   unnatural   monstrous        I doubt not   cried he again   if the truth could be known  but it was   some such ridiculous adventure as this that lost her the affection of   Mr  Trueworth  though her pride and his honour joined to conceal it        The elder Mr  Thoughtless was entirely of his brother s opinion in all   these points  and both of them were more confirmed than ever  that   marriage was the only sure guard for the reputation of a young woman of   their sister s temper  Mr  Munden had been there the day before  and  as   he told Miss Betsy he would do  declared himself to them  so it was   resolved between them  that if  on proper enquiry  his circumstances   should be found such as he said they were  to clap up the wedding with   all imaginable expedition       But no business  how important or perplexing soever it be  can render   gratitude and good manners forgotten or neglected by persons of   understanding and politeness  These gentlemen thought a visit to Mr    Trueworth neither could or ought to be dispensed with  in order to make   him those acknowledgements the service he had done their sister demanded   from them       Accordingly  the next morning  Mr  Thoughtless  accompanied by his   brother  went in his own coach  which he made be got ready  as well in   respect to himself as to the person he was going to visit       They found Mr  Trueworth at home  who  doubtless  was not without some   expectation of their coming  On their sending up their names  he   received them at the top of the stair case with so graceful an   affability and sweetness in his air  as convinced the elder Mr    Thoughtless  that the high character his brother Frank had given of that   gentleman  was far from exceeding the bounds of truth       It is certain  indeed  that Mr  Trueworth  since the eclaircissement of   the Denham affair  had felt the severest remorse within himself  for   having given credit to that wicked aspersion cast upon Miss Betsy  and   the reflection  that fortune had now put it in his power to atone for   the wrong he had been guilty of to that lady  by the late service he had   done her  gave a secret satisfaction to his mind  that diffused itself   through all his air  and gave a double sprightliness to those eyes   which  by the report of all who ever saw him  stood in need of no   addition to their lustre       The elder Mr  Thoughtless  having made his compliments on the occasion   which had brought him thither  the younger advanced  though with a look   somewhat more downcast than ordinary   I know not  Sir   said he     whether any testimonies of the gratitude I owe you will be acceptable    after the folly into which a mistaken rage transported me last   night     Dear Frank   cried Mr  Trueworth  smiling  and giving him his   hand  in token of a perfect reconciliation   none of these formal   speeches  we know each other  you are by nature warm  and the little   philosophy I am master of  makes me think whatever is born with us   pleads it s own excuse  besides  to see me with your sister in the   condition she then was  entirely justifies your mistake     Dear   Trueworth   replied the other  embracing him   you are born every way to   overcome        Mr  Thoughtless returning to some expressions of his sense of the   obligation he had conferred upon their whole family   Sir  I have done   no more   said Mr  Trueworth   than what every man of honour would think   himself bound to do for any woman in the like distress  much more for a   lady so deserving as Miss Betsy Thoughtless  I happened  almost   miraculously  to be in the same house with her when she stood in need of   assistance  and I shall always place the day in which my good stars   conducted me to the rescue of her innocence  among the most fortunate   ones of my whole life        In the course of their conversation  the brothers satisfied Mr    Trueworth s curiosity  by acquainting
