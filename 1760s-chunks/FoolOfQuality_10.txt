plain    Thy Jack shall return to his Gracey again      Or alone in his Gracey s sweet company blest    To feed the young robins that chirp on the nest    To help at her med cines and herbs for the poor    And welcome the stranger that stops at the door    At night  o er our fire and a cup of clear ale    To hear the town news and the traveller s tale     To smile away life  till our heads they grow hoar    And part from my sheep and my Gracey no more      Brooke did not improve the song by changing Gracey    the sweetheart  into a sister  This  like many more of the   songs  was composed for one of the melodies native to   Ireland and Scotland  and familiar to Brooke s audience    to wit    Lochaber no more        Brooke was continually writing plays  few  if any  of which   is there any reason to suppose were successful  The   biographer of his daughter wonders how it came about that   a man with so strong a bias for   Methodistical   opinions in   religion felt himself at liberty to write so perseveringly for   the stage  It was  I suppose  only another instance of his   natural liberality and breadth of mind  The same writer   tells an interesting story of Brooke s profoundly religious   character  and gifts that might have fitted him for a career   in the Church  One Sunday  while the congregation were   assembled in the parish in which he lived  they waited a   long time the arrival of their clergyman  At last  finding   he was not likely to come that day  they judged that some   accident had detained him  and being loth to depart         xx INTRODUCTION     entirely without their errand  they  with one accord  requested   that Mr  Brooke would perform the service for them  and   expound a part of the Scriptures  He consented  and the   previous prayers being over  he opened the Bible  and   preached extempore on the first text that struck his eye    In the midst of his discourse the clergyman entered and   found his whole congregation in tears  He entreated Mr    Brooke to proceed   but this he modestly refused   and the   other as modesty declared  that after the testimony of   superior abilities  which he perceived in the moist eyes of   all present  he would think it presumption and folly to hazard   anything of his own  Accordingly  the concluding prayers   alone were said  and the congregation dismissed for the   day       In 1749 Brooke was solicited by a large body of the   electors of Dublin to stand for that city at the approaching   election  but he declined the honour    because of some of   the most eminent merchants having published a declaration   in favour of another man  who   he modestly says    to the   advantages of being a free citizen and excelling trader  he   adds an acknowledged superiority in every other merit   He   was probably of too Quixotic a disposition to succeed in   parliamentary life  His various excursions into politics dis    pleased every party   his tracts on the Irish Catholics  in   spite of the praise they won by their literary merits  had no   practical effect whatever  It has been well said of him that     he saw the peaks of virtue in enthusiastic lights  and if he   conceived that he was sailing on the current of truth  his   course then became reckless  and he would scorn the rudder   while he hoisted every sail to drive with the breeze or catch   the blast  He had a thorough knowledge of the world in   theory  and saw into character with a piercing eye   but he   was simple and artless in his practical conduct  and too   chivalrous for common life   The same writer records a   pleasant trait in his character   A clever pamphlet was   published against him full of personalities  and just after he   had finished its perusal a friend came in and inquired how   he had liked it  Brooke answered    Why  sir  I laughed at   its wit  and smiled at its malice     Many letters and other   evidences are on record of his alert sympathy with the joys   and sorrows of his friends   he was the kindest of landlords    though often imposed upon  and entered into the troubles of   every cottier on his estate with a degree of sympathy almost   morbid          INTRODUCTION xxi
