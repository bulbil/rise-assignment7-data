to redress their grievances  and there beheaded the Lord Treasurer  The government might readily perceive the disaffection of the populace  by his reception   176 from the city of London  who opened their gates to him  however  upon the King s proclamation  his adherents  after a day or two  were dispersed  and he himself taken and slain  In the mean time the Duke of York secretly fomented these disturbances  and  pretending to espouse the cause of the people  from his retreat in Wales wrote to the King  advising a reformation in the ministry  His letters of counsel were soon backed by an army  he marched up to London  but found an unexpected repulse from the city  which shut its gates upon him  In this dilemma he offered to disband his army  if the Duke of Somerset  who was at that time the envied object in power  should be sent to the Tower  this request was complied with  contrary to his expectation  and now  coming to court to accuse him in person  he was surprized to see the Duke of Somerset  who was hid behind the hangings  suddenly coming forth  and retorting the accusation upon him  York now perceived his danger  and repressed the impetuosity of his accusation  As soon as he left the presence  the King commanded him to be apprehended  but such was the Duke s authority  or such the timidity of the King s council  that they suffered him to retire  upon promising strict obedience for the future   This reconciliation was only temporary  he still aspired at the crown  and  the King falling ill  by his intrigues he had sufficient art to be taken into the number of the privy council  This was a fatal blow to Henry s interests  the Duke of York  now let into a share of the authority  and secure of the affections of the people  carried all before him  The Duke of Somerset was sent to the Tower  and the parliament declared his rival Protector   177 of the realm  This power the Duke of York  for some time  enjoyed without controul  till the unhappy King  recovering from his dizziness  as if awaking from a dream  perceived  with surprize  that he was stripped of his authority  Margaret  his Queen  did all in her power to rouze him to a sense of his situation  he therefore began by deposing the Duke from his power  who instantly had recourse to arms  The impotent Monarch  thus obliged to take the field  was dragged after his army to the battle of St  Alban s  where he was routed by the Duke of York  and Somerset  his General  was flain  The King  being wounded  and hiding himself in a cottage near the field of battle  was taken prisoner  and treated with seeming respect  from thence he was brought along  in triumph  to London  and the Duke permitting him still to enjoy the title of King  reserved to himself that of Protector  in which consisted all the power of the crown   Henry was now but a prisoner  treated with the forms of royalty  yet  indolent and sickly as he was  the title alone seemed sufficient for him  At last his friends induced him once more to re assert his prerogative  the Duke of York again retired  to resist the designs of the Queen  Mutual distrust once more brought their armies to the field  and the fate of the kingdom was to be decided by the sword  On the King s side  the Queen seemed the only acting General  she ranged the army in battalia  gave the necessary orders  while the poor King ws led about  from place to place  an involuntary spectator of those martial preparations  The army on the opposite side was  in the absence of the Duke of York  commanded by the Earl of Warwick  the most celebrated General of his   178 age  a man formed for times of trouble  extremely artful  and extremely brave  equally skilful in council and the field  and born to give and to take away kingdoms at pleasure  After many battles without effect  and designs without consequence  both armies  at last  met on a plain near Northampton  the Queen s army consisted of five and twenty thousand men  the army of Warwick of forty thousand  Never was greater animosity between the chiefs of an army before  both pretending to fight for the King  whose authority they equally attempted to destroy  While the Queen went about from rank to rank  the King staid in his tent  waiting the issue of the battle with female doubts and apprehensions  both sides fought five hours with the utmost obstinacy  but the good fortune of the Earl of Warwick was superior to that of the Queen  she was conquered  and had the misfortune to see the King taken prisoner in his tent  Thus Henry was once more brought back  in triumph  to his capital   A parliament was now called to give a face to this successful rebellion  The Duke of York  though formerly contented with the title of Protector  now claimed the crown  Our prospects widen as we rise  the cause of Henry and the Duke was
