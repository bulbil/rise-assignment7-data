than three days  where we should have an opportunity of preferring our complaints to the admiral —The Welchman joined in my remonstrances  and was at great pains to demonstrate  that it was every man s duty as well as interest to resign himself to the divine will  and look upon himself as a centinel upon duty  who is by no means at liberty to leave his post before he is relieved —Thomson listened attentively to what we said  and at last  shedding a flood of tears  shook his head  and left us  without making any reply —About eleven at night  he came to see us again  with a settled gloom on his countenance  and gave us to understand  that he had undergone excessive toil since he saw us  and in recompence  had been grosly abused by the doctor  who taxed him with being confederate with us  in a design of taking away his life and that of the captain  After some time spent in mutual exhortation  he got up  and squeezing me by the hand with an uncommon fervour  cried    God bless you both    and left us to wonder at his   266 singular manner of parting with us  which did not fail to make an impression on us both     Next morning  when the hour of visitation ame round  this unhappy young man was a missing  and after strick search  supposed to have gone over board in the night  which was certainly the case   CHAP  XXX   We lament over the fate of our companion—the captain offers Morgan his liberty  which he refuses to accept—we are brought before him and examined—Morgan is sent back to custody  whither also I am remanded after a curious trial   THE news of this event affected my fellow prisoner and me extremely  as our unfortunate companion had justly acquired by his amiable disposition  the love and esteem of us both  and the more we regretted his untimely fate  the greater horror we conceived for the villain who was undoubtedly the occasion of it —This abandoned miscreant did not discover the least symptom of concern for Thomson s death  although he must be conscious to himself  of having driven him by ill usage to that fatal resolution  but desired the captain to set Morgan at liberty again to look after the patients  Accordingly  one of the corporals was sent up to unfetter him  when he protested he would not be released until he should know for what he was confined  nor   267 would he be a tennis ball  nor a shittle cock  nor a trudge  nor a scullion to any captain under the sun —Oakhum finding him obstinate  and fearing it would not be in his power to exercise his tyranny much longer with impunity  was willing to shew some appearance of justice  and therefore ordered us both to be brought before him  on the quarter deck  where he sat in state  with his clerk on one side  and his counsellor Mackshane on the other —When we approached  he honoured us with this salutation     So  gentlemen  d—n my blood  many a captain in the navy would have ordered you both to be tucked up to the yard s arm  without either judge or jury  for the crimes you have been guilty of  but d—n my blood  I have too much good nature  in allowing such dogs as you to make your defence  —   Captain Oaghum   said my fellow sufferer  certainly it is in your power  Got help the while  to tuck us all up at your will  and desire  and pleasures —And perhaps it would be petter for some of us to be tucked up  than undergo the miseries to which we have been exposed —So may the farmer hang his kids for his diversion  and amusement  and mirth  but there is such a thing as justice  if not upon earth  surely in heaven  that will punish with fire and primstone all those who take away the lives of innocent people out of wantonness and parparity  look you  —In the mean time  I shall be glad to know the crimes laid to my charge  and see the person who accuses me  —   That you shall  said the captain  here doctor  what have you to say  —  Mackshane stepping forward  hemmed a good while  in order to clear his   268 throat  and before he began  Morgan accosted him thus    Doctor Mackshane  look in my face—look in the face of an honest man  who abhorrs a false witness as he abhorrs the tevil  and Got be judge between you and me  —  The doctor not minding this conjuration  made the following speech  as near as I can remember —   I ll tell you what  Mr  Morgan  to be sure what you say is just  in regard to an honest man  and if so be it appears as how you are an honest man  then it is my opinion  that you deserve to be acquitted  in relation to that there affair  for I tell you what  captain Oakhum is resolved for to do every body justice —As for my own part  all that I have to alledge  is that I
