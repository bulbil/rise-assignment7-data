 if I but looked  they flew to the place  where I cast my eye  every motion of mine sent them running round the whole shop for my satisfaction  I informed them that I wanted what was good  and they shewed me not less than forty pieces  and each was better than the former  the prettiest pattern in nature  and the fittest in the world for night caps  My very good friend  said I to the mercer  you must not pretend to instruct me in silks  I know these in particular to be no better than your mere flimsy Bungees  That may be  cried the mercer  who I afterwards found had never contradicted a man in his life  I can t pretend to say but they may  but I can assure you  my Lady Trail has had a sacque from this piece this very morning  But friend  said I  though my Lady has chosen a sacque from it  I see no necessity that I should wear it for a nightcap  That may be  returned he again  yet what becomes a pretty Lady  will at any time look well on a handsome Gentleman  This short compliment was thrown in so very seasonably upon my ugly face  that even tho  I disliked the silk  I desired him to cut me off the pattern of a night cap   While this business was consigned to his journeyman  the master himself took down some pieces of silk still finer than any I had yet seen  and spreading them before me  There  cries he  there s beauty  my Lord Snakeskin has bespoke the fellow to this for the birth night this very morning  it would look charmingly in waistcoats  But I don t want a waistcoat  replied I  Not want a waistcoat  returned the mercer  then I would advise you to buy one  when waistcoats are wanted  you may depend   55 upon it they will come dear  Always buy before you want  and you are sure to be well used  as they say in Cheapside  There was so much justice in his advice  that I could not refuse taking it  besides  the silk  which was really a good one  encreased the temptation  so I gave orders for that too   As I was waiting to have my bargains measured and cut  which I know not how  they executed but slowly  during the interval  the mercer entertained me with the modern manner of some of the nobility receiving company in their morning gowns  Perhaps  Sir  adds he  you have a mind to see what kind of silk is universally worn  Without waiting for my reply  he spreads a piece before me  which might be reckoned beautiful even in China  If the nobility  continues he  were to know I sold this to any  under a Right Honourable  I should certainly lose their custom  you see  my Lord  it is at once rich  tastey  and quite the thing  I am no Lord  interrupted I —I beg pardon  cried he  but be pleased to remember  when you intend buying a morning gown  that you had an offer from me of something worth money  Conscience  Sir  conscience is my way of dealing  you may buy a morning gown now  or you may stay till they become dearer and less fashionable  but it is not my business to advise  In short  most reverend Fum  he persuaded me to buy a morning gown also  and would probably have persuaded me to have bought half the goods in his shop  if I had stayed long enough  or was furnished with sufficient money   Upon returning home  I could not help reflecting with some astonishment  how this very man with such a confined education and capacity  was   56 yet capable of turning me as he thought proper  and molding me to his inclinations  I know he was only answering his own purposes  even while he attempted to appear solicitous about mine  yet by a voluntary infatuation  a sort of passion compounded of vanity and good nature  I walked into the snare with my eyes open  and put myself to future pain in order to give him immediate pleasure  The wisdom of the ignorant  somewhat resembles the instinct of animals  it is diffused in but a very narrow sphere  but within that circle it acts with vigour  uniformity  and success   Adieu   LETTER LXXV  From the same   FROM my former accounts you may be apt to fancy the English the most ridiculous people under the sun  They are indeed ridiculous  yet every other nation in Europe is equally so  each laughs at each  and the Asiatic at all   I may  upon another occasion  point out what is most strikingly absurd in other countries  I shall at present consine myself only to France  The first national peculiarity a traveller meets upon entering that kingdom  is an odd sort of a staring vivacity in every eye  not excepting even the children  the people  it seems  have got it into their heads that they have more wit than others  and so stare in order to look smart     57I know not how it happens  but there appears a sickly
