have commanded under my patronage  Thus did I inveigh with friendly vehemence against the poet of the Asturias  and disturb the even tenor of my mind for an event  which the sufferer hailed with joy  and inserted among the well omened particulars of his journal   He came to see me within two days  and appeared in high spirits  Santillane  cried he  I am come to receive your congratulations  My fortune is made  my friend  though my play is marred  You know what a mistake they made on the first and last night of  The Count of Saldagna   hissed instead of applauding  You would have thought all the wild beasts of the forest had been let loose  with their ears fortified against the softening power of poetry  but the more they bellowed  the better I fared  and they have roared me into a provision for life   There was no knowing what to make of this incident in the drama of our poet s adventures  What is all this  Fabricio  said I  how can theatrical damnation have conjured up such Elysian ecstacy  It is exactly so  answered he  I told you before that Don Bertrand had thrown in some of the circumstances  and he was fully convinced that there was no defect but in the taste of the spectators  They might he very good judges  but  if they were  he was no judge at all  Nunez  said he this morning   Victrix causa Diis placuit  sed victa Catoni    Members of parliament  and the ladies  will probably expect a translation of these hard words  but I refer the former to their dictionaries  to which they bade a long farewell on leaving Eton or Harrow  and the latter to an extended paraphrase of five acts in the tragedy of Cato  Those of the softer sex who may think the Stoic philosophy rude and uncouth  will feel their nerves vibrate in unison with the love scenes     Translator    Your piece has been ill received by the public  but against that you may place my entire approbation  and thus you ought to set your heart at rest  By way of something to balance the bad taste of the age  I shall settle an annuity of two thousand crowns on you  go to my solicitor  and let him draw the deed  We have been about it  the treasurer has signed and sealed  my first quarter is paid in advance          I wished Fabricio joy on the unhappy fate of  The Count of Saldagna   and probably most authors would have envied his failure more than all the success that ever succeeded  You are in the right  continued he  to prefer my fortune to my fame  What a lucky peal of disapprobation in double choir  If the public had chosen to ring the changes on my merits rather than my misdeeds  what would they have done for my pocket  A mere paltry nothing  The common pay of the theatre might have kept me from starving  but the wind of popular malice has blown me a comfortable pension  engrossed on safe and legal parchment       CH  XI     Santillane gives Scipio a situation  the latter sets out for New Spain   MY secretary could not look at the unexpected good luck of Nunez the poet without envy  he talked of nothing else for a week  The whims of that baggage  Fortune  said he  are most unaccountable  she delights to turn her lottery wheel into the lap of a sorry author  while she deals out her disappointments like a step  mother to the race of good ones  I should have no objection  though  if she would throw me up a prize in one of her vertical progresses  That is likely enough to happen  said I  and sooner than you imagine  Here you are in her temple  for it is scarcely too presumptuous to call the house of a prime minister the temple of Fortune  where favours are conferred by wholesale  and votaries grow fat on the spoils of her altar  That is very true  sir  answered he  but we must have patience  and wait till the happy moment comes  Take my advice while it is worth having  Scipio  replied I  and make your mind easy  perhaps you are on the eve of some good appointment  And so it turned out  for within a few days an opportunity offered of employing him advantageously in my lord duke s service  and I did not suffer the happy moment to pass by   I was engaged in chat one morning with Don Raymond Caporis  the prime minister s steward  and our conversation turned on the sources of his excellency s income  My lord  said he  enjoys the commanderies of all the military orders  yielding a revenue of forty thousand crowns a year  and he is only obliged to wear the cross of Alcantara  Moreover  his three offices of great chamberlain  master of the home  and high chancellor of the Indies  bring him in nn income of two hundred thousand crowns  and yet all this is nothing in comparison of the immense sums which he receives through other transatlantic channels  but you
