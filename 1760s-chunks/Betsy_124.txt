 and which happened some little time before her going   to Oxford with her brother Frank       On her first coming to town  a woman had been recommended to her for   starching  and making up her fine linen  This person she had ever since   employed  and took a great fancy to  as she found her honest    industrious  and very obliging  The poor creature was unhappily married    her husband was gone from her  and had listed himself for a soldier    Being born in a distant country  she had no relations to whom she could   apply for assistance  was big with child  and had no support but the   labour of her hands  These calamitous circumstances so much touched the   commiserative nature of Miss Betsy  that she frequently gave her double   the sum she demanded for her work  besides bestowing on her many things   she left off wearing  which  though trifles in themselves  were very   helpful to a person in such distress       Miss Mabel  for whom she also worked at the same time  was no less her   patroness than Miss Betsy  In fine  they were both extremely kind to   her  insomuch as made her often cry out  in a transport of gratitude    that these two good young ladies were worth to her all the customers   she had besides  They continued to prove themselves so indeed  for when   her child was born  which happened to be a girl  they stood godmothers    and not only gave handsomely themselves  but raised a contribution among   their acquaintance  for the support of the lying in woman and her   infant  the former  however  did not long enjoy the blessing of two such   worthy friends  she died before the expiration of her month  and the   latter  being wholly destitute  was about to be thrown upon the parish    Some well disposed neighbour  who knew how kind Miss Mabel and Miss   Betsy had been  came and acquainted them with the melancholy story  they   consulted together  and each reflecting that she had undertaken the   protection of this infant at the font  thought herself bound by duty to   preserve if from those hardships with which children thus exposed are   sometimes treated  they  therefore  as they were equally engaged  agreed   to join equally in the maintenance of this innocent forlorn       This was a rare charity indeed  and few there are  especially at their   years  who so justly consider the obligations of a baptismal covenant    It was also the more to be admired  as neither of them had the incomes   of their fortunes in their own hands  the one being under guardianship    and the other at the allowance of a father  who  though rich  was   extremely avaricious       As they were  therefore  obliged to be good oeconomists in this point    and nurses in the country are to be had at a much cheaper rate than in   the town  they got a person to seek out for one who would not be   unreasonable in her demands  and at the same time do justice to her   charge  Such a one  according to the character given of her by   neighbours  being found  the child  decently cloathed  was sent down to   her habitation  which was in a little village about seventeen miles from   London  For the sake of concealing the part Miss Mabel had in this   affair from the knowledge of her father  it was judged proper that Miss   Betsy should seem to take the whole upon herself  which she did  and the   nurse s husband came up every month and received the money from her   hands  as also whatever other necessaries the child wanted       Who would imagine that such a glorious act of benevolence should ever be   made a handle to traduce and vilify the author  Yet what cannot malice    accompanied with cunning  do  It can give the fairest virtue the   appearance of the foulest vice  and pervert the just estimation of the   world into a mistaken scorn and contempt       Miss Flora  after receiving the disappointment  as related in the sixth   chapter of this volume  was far from desisting from the wicked design   she had conceived of putting an end to the intercourse between Miss   Betsy and Mr  Trueworth  Her fertile brain presented her with a thousand   strategems  which she rejected  either as they were too weak to   accomplish what she wished  or too liable to discovery  till at last she   hit upon the most detestable project of representing what proceeded from   the noblest propensity of Miss Betsy s nature  as the effect of a   criminal compulsion  in fine  to make it appear so feasible
