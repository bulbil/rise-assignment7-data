had received the advice of those she thought proper to consult on the occasion  she determined to offer herself to the manager or one of the theatres  Accordingly   35 she attended at his house for a whole week together  without being able to gain admittance  insomuch  that having lost many opportunities of getting money in her stared employ  she had almost resolved to give up all thoughts of appearing on the stage  after meeting with so many difficulties in arriving at the presence of the manager  before she could be examined concerning her real merit  adding to this  the little hope there was of being engaged when so many had been already rejected  But she was diverted from this resolution by Mr  M—y  who informed her  that these were obstacles of a very trisling nature  in comparison with those she had to surmount  and that many had attended for successive years  and having been at length received  the consequent advantages had abundantly retaliated all their pains and patience   At length  however  she obtained a hearing from Mr  G—k of Drury Lane play house  but  after rehearsing several speeches  was complimented on her figure  and promising talents  and then dismissed with a formal expression of concern  that   36 his company was complete at present  and therefore he had no occasion for any additional performer  yer  if he could find any opening for her the next season  she might depend on an engagement   Thus disappointed in her first application  she repaired to one of the managers of the other house  and was informed  that he could not act without the concurrence of the other proprietors  and as it required some time to lay her case before them  he must beg her to wait the determination till next week  At the expiration of the appointed time  she attended  and  to her great joy  was received at a salary of four pounds per week   During the prevalence of her inclination  to the drama  she became acquainted with several ladies of the profession  who looked on her  as one in training to compose their society  She soon discovered  by the drift of their conversation  that many of them were not supported by their salaries  and that the principal design in coming on the stage  was not so much for obtaining the income they were paid  as   37 from the prospect of procuring a keeper  several were already on this footing  and those whose success had not been equal  made a virtue of necessity  and railed at those they envied  because they were more fortunate in their face  and  its consequence  a lover   This discovery was a farther consolation to her  and she rejoiced  that in a theatrical life  there was no necessity of giving up her gallantry  nor did she long want a confirmation of it  being addressed on that score by a young gentleman of rank  dignity  and every other attracting qualification   Mr  M—y  whose circumstances  as has been already observed  were such as would not allow him to answer her frequent pecuniary demands on him  easily consented to her entertaining this new lover  provided she did not refuse to suffer him also  sometimes  to partake of her favours   Mr  P lm r was so enamoured of our heroine  that his prevailing passion  was to gratify her most darling inclinations    38 and he seemed to live but in her smiles  yet so prevalent was her disposition for shifting scenes in life  that a new object soon engrossed her attention  and induced her to treat this generous lover with the utmost ingratitude   Captivated with the elegant form and melodious voice of a certain singer at the opera house  she admitted him to such liberties  even in the presence of Mr  P—l—m—r  as could not fail of giving him high disgust  and soon proved the cause of their separation  Thus abandoned by this gentlemen  to indulge her natural propensity  she cohabited some time with her musical acquaintance  who found means to strip her of what she had procured during her connexion with him  and afterwards left her to provide for herself   During her acquaintance with this Italian  she had often made a party at cards at a certain house not far from Covent Garden  where she added to her knowledge those arts by which the worthless live with apparent splendor  and the inexperienced are trapanned  to their utter   39 destruction  The hostess of this virtuous mansion had long borne the sway in the list of wine bibbers  and outvied all the bawds in the metropolis in drunkenness  obscenity  and blasphemy  Here she became acquainted with a noted gamester  and her adventures with him were very singular  He was a fellow of most dissolute morals  and one of the many in this town  who  under the mask of gentility  ruin the unexperienced and unwary  by their premeditated fraud and villainy  she was recommended to him  as one whose personal charms might be advantageous to both   He jumped at the hint  and a meeting was appointed  The old lady of the house presided  and proposed  that whatever they earned in their respective occupations  should become a joint stock  and be
