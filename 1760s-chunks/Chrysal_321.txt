do most masters appear     Ha   ha   ha  Well  then  it seems all your objections are to the   fable  You have nothing to say against the sentiments and   diction           The sentiments  sir  may be very proper  and the diction suited   to them  but you must be sensible that the former objection affects   them all equally  The characters are too low  and the sentiments   and diction consequently too coarse          Sir â€” sir â€” sir â€” I shall not enter into any further arguments with   you  His grace bids me tell you he insists upon your receiving it    or giving him such reasons as he shall think satisfactory  which   must be very different from those insignificant cavils          His grace need not exert his authority to influence my obedience    The least hint of his pleasure were sufficient   but unluckily I am   engaged for the whole season â€” quite full          Pull   Why did you not tell me so at first           Because you insisted on having my opinion          Very well  sir  I shall let his grace and all my friends know how   you have behaved  Let me have the play   impertinent  insolent    ignorant puppy    muttered he  as he went out        So    said my master  as soon as he was gone    I have now made   him my enemy for ever  As for his noble friends  they are above   troubling themselves about anything of the kind  and give him   leave to mention their names only to get rid of his importunity            CHAPTER XVIII     CONTINUATION   CHEYSAL s MASTER REJECTS THE WORK OF A POET   POK HIS IGNORANCE OE THE LAWS OF THE DRAMA â€” MORE DRAMA    TICAL STRICTURES â€” THE POET MODESTLY INSISTS THAT HIS PLAT   IS REFUSED ONLY BECAUSE IT WANTS THE INTEREST OF THE   GREAT  AND GOES OFF IN A HUFF â€” ANOTHER POET REPULSED FOB   HIS ATTACHMENT TO THE LAWS OF THE DRAMA â€” ARGUMENTS   AGAINST THESE LAWS â€” THE POET REFUSES TO CONFORM TO THE   PRESENT TASTE  AND MAKES AN APPEAL â€” ONE MORE POET RE    FUSED  ONLY FOR WANTING EVERY POETICAL TALENT â€” REMARKS   ON SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS MORE THAN CARE TO OWN IT     The last poet was scarce downstairs when a footman announced   the entrance of another  My master did not think it necessary         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 381     to observe so much ceremony with him as he had done with the   former  but told him directly that he could not receive his piece    Such a sentence struck the poet all of a heap  He was unable to   epeak for some moments  but recovering himself at length â€”   Not   receive it  sir     said he    You surprise me  Pray  sir  why so           I am very loath to find fault  sir    answered my master    but   you seem to be utterly unacquainted with all the laws of the drama          The laws of the drama 1 They are but art  I write from   nature  These laws have been long laid aside  Shakespeare wrote   without laws          So much the worse  But he is a dangerous example to imitate    The local temporary laws of the ancient drama are laid aside  it is   true  but not the immutable  general laws of propriety and reason    Your fable is unconnected  improbable  and unaffecting          How  sir  unaffecting   Can the fall of a mighty empire be   said to be unaffecting           No  sir   but the description of it most certainly may  if not   drawn with judgment and force  And then your characters are   ill supported  and your sentiments and language lost in the clouds          What  sir   Can the sentiments of kings and princes be too   sublime           There is a wide difference between being sublime and swollen   out of nature          But what objection can you make to the language   Is it not   raised with epithets and metaphors  and all the figures of poetry           Good sir  poetical figures in
