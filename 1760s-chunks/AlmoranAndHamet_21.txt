shall be done to HAMET   Then turning to ALMORAN     Henceforth   said he   the kingdom shall be mine or thine  To govern in   concert with thee  is to associate with the powers of hell  The beings   that are superior to evil  are the friends of HAMET  and if these are   thy enemies  what shall be thy defence   ALMORAN replied only by a   contemptuous smile  and the assembly being dismissed he retired to his   apartment  and HAMET and OMAR went out to the people  who had gathered   in an incredible multitude about the palace                CHAP  X          A rumour of what had happened within had reached them  which some   believed  and some doubted  but when they saw OMAR and HAMET return   together  and observed that their looks were full of resentment and   trouble  they became silent with attention in a moment  which OMAR   observing  addressed them with an eloquence of which they had often   acknowledged the force  and of which they never repented the effect       He told them the tender connexion between HAMET and ALMEIDA  and   disclosed the subtil hypocrisy of ALMORAN  he expatiated upon the folly   of supposing  that the power that was supreme in goodness and truth    should command a violation of vows that had been mutually interchanged    and often repeated  and devote to ALMORAN the beauties  which could only   be voluntarily surrendered to HAMET  They heard him with a vacant   countenance of surprize and wonder  and while he waited for their reply    they agreed among themselves  that no man could avoid the destiny that   was written upon his head  and that if ALMEIDA had thus been taken from   HAMET  and given to ALMORAN  it was an event that by an unchangeable   decree was appointed to happen  and that  therefore  it was their duty   to acquiesce  OMAR then beckoned with his hand for audience a second   time  and told them  that ALMORAN had not only practised the arts of   sorcery to deprive HAMET of ALMEIDA  but that he meditated a design to   usurp the sole dominion  and deprive him of the share of the government   to which he had a right by the will of Solyman his father  This also   they heard with the same sentiments of wonder and acquiescence  If it is   decreed  said they  that ALMORAN shall be king alone  who can prevent   it  and if it is not  who can bring it to pass   But know ye not   said   OMAR   that when the end is appointed  the means are appointed also  If   it is decreed that one of you shall this night die by poison  is it not   decreed also that he shall drink it        The crowd now gazed upon each other  without reply  for some minutes    and at last they only said  that no effort of theirs could change the   universal appointment of all things  that if ALMORAN was to be king   alone  he would be so notwithstanding all opposition  and that if he was   not to be king alone  no attempt of his own  however supported  could   make him so   I will not   said OMAR   contradict your opinion  I will   only tell you what I have heard  and leave you to  suffer the calamities   which threaten you  with a fortitude and resignation that are suitable   to your principles  having no consolation to offer you  but that HAMET    whose destiny it was not to make you happy  will suffer with you the   evils  that neither he nor you could prevent  the mournful comfort of   this fellowship  he will not be denied  for he loves you too well  to   wish even to be happy alone   The crowd fixed their eyes upon HAMET  for   whom their affection was now strongly moved  with looks of much greater   intelligence and sensibility  a confused murmur  like the fall of the   pebbles upon the beach when the surge retires from the shore  expressed   their gratitude to HAMET  and their apprehensions for themselves       OMAR waited till they were again silent  and then improved the advantage   he had gained   ALMORAN   said he   considers you as the slaves of his   power  HAMET as the objects of his benevolence  your lives and your   properties  in the opinion of ALMORAN  are below his notice  but HAMET   considers his own interest as connected with yours  When ALMORAN    therefore  shall be unchecked by the influence of HAMET  he will leave   you to the mercy of some delegated tyrant
