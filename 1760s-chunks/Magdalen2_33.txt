countenance of Hastings— Harold  —exclaimed he— Harold   drawing his chair insensibly from the table  and fixing his eyes on me  with an absolute wildness of surprize—   Pray  Sir  are you the Sir Robert Harold—who so lately courted Miss Mildmay      The very same   cried I  running to the door  and bolting it—   and you are the Sir Harry Hastings  who have been villain enough to carry off that admirable woman  in a forcible manner  from her family  and to imprison her for several months in a house  where her delicacy was to be treated with a continued round of outrage  and where the imprisonment of her person was to do an irreparable injury to her reputation —Draw    195 Sir —for the same providential dispensation which has delivered her out of your hands  now delivers you up for punishment to mine      Mighty pretty truly   returned Sir Harry  clapping his hand also upon his sword  but retreating a little—   and so I have been all this while unbosoming myself to my greatest enemy  upon a full supposition that I was making an agreeable acquaintance  if not a valuable friend —Truly  a very pretty rencounter—but I deserve it all —What business had this damn d tongue of mine to run on so impertinently in the company of an absolute stranger —And so  Sir Robert Harold  I must give you satisfaction for behaving like an infamous scoundrel to Miss Mildmay       196 Sir   replied I impatiently    this is no time for words —The man who could behave basely to Louisa Mildmay  must be the greatest of all villains  and—      I am glad to find you so extremely candid  Sir Robert   interrupted he sneeringly   because  if you will only take the trouble of reflecting a little  you will find yourself much a greater villain than your humble servant —You  Sir   continued he  altering his voice  and coming up fiercely to me   You are a mighty proper person to commence a champion for the cause of virtue —I carried off Louisa  it is true  and  though I own the action to be highly criminal  yet is it by any means so poor  so paltry  so despicable  as your conduct in assuming the sacred appearance of honour and attachment  to break in upon the   197 unsuspecting confidence of her soul  and to blast her reputation  Her character  Sir  was as unsullied as the noontide beams of heaven   till you insidiously found means to steal upon her affections  and  in an accursed hour  like the basest of all scoundrels  infamously violated every law of hospitality—every sentiment of friendship—and every protestation of love —I have violated no law of hospitality—have broke no link of friendship—have burst no protestation of love —On the contrary  so far was I from wishing to betray Louisa Mildmay  that I was even willing to take her  stained and polluted as she was by your baseness  and did not hesitate an instant to participate in her shame —And shall you  the original author of all her misfortunes  shall you take upon you to call others to an account —Shall you  a villain of such deeper   198 dye  stand up as an advocate for injured innocence  and talk of chastizing offenders  who are  comparatively  spotless to yourself —Audacious scoundrel  let me rather  as infinitely the least culpable of the two  here take vengeance upon you  for all the calamities which have befallen a woman  whom I doat upon to distraction —From the moment I first heard of your success with her  your very name planted a thousand scorpions in my bosom  and I would have sacrificed you to my rage  had not an indication of my resentment been likely to disappoint my designs upon Louisa —I therefore studiously avoided seeing you  well knowing the vehemence of my own temper —But the time is now come—and it is not a little of your blood  which can gratify the greediness of my revenge       199Melmoth  cowardice and guilt are inseparable companions —By the God of Heaven  this harangue of Sir Harry s almost petrified me —I felt myself a paltry despicable villain  and I actually believe  had not his sword been already pointed at my bosom  the justice of his reply would have sham d my resentment into silence  and awed me into all conscientious acknowledgments of the keenest self reproach—but my manhood was roused at the sight of his naked weapon  and to it we went  with as determined a malignity  as ever rankled in the breasts of men —Sir Harry had great command of his sword  and was prodigiously strong in the arm—for some time he thought to conquer me by a mere exertion of force —but finding this method ineffectual  he threw out one of those exquisite feints  which none but a master indeed should ever think of giving into —I don t believe   200 he thought me so good a swordsman as I really am—however  before he could possibly recover himself  I made so rapid a lunge  that my sword was half way through his right breast  and the violence of the thrust  together with the acuteness of the pain  brought him instantly to the
