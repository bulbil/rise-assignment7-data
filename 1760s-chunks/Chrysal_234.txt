by the change  the slavery   of a soldier s life being still more intolerable than that of a monk    I therefore had recourse to my former expedient for relief  and   deserted the very first opportunity  I then threw myself at random   upon the world  without any particular point to direct my course   to   but this did not discourage me  I had boldly thrown off the   shackles which foolish man had forged for himself  to prevent his   rising in life  and regulated my conduct solely by my convenience    This gave me a superiority over the rest of mankind  which I never   failed to avail myself of  I looked upon their follies as my in    heritance  and soon found abundant opportunities of turning them   to my advantage  For some years I lived a life of ramble  in the   course of which I met with many adventures  At length I thought   my own country too narrow a sphere to confine my activity to    and so I went to Spain  where I expected an ample harvest from the   ignorance and superstition of the people   but their poverty dis    appointed my hopes  and almost starved me into repentance of my   expedition  However  I proceeded to Madrid  where the credulity   of a countryman of my own made me amends for the reserve of the   natives  He not only relieved my immediate wants  which were   too pressing to be borne  but also entrusted into my hands some   valuable materials for a literary work  from which he expected both   reputation and profit  But I disappointed his hopes  for  being   tired of Spain  I took the first opportunity of going to try my fortune   in some other country  and carried all his papers vrith me  Nor   was this all he suffered by his confidence  I had before experienced   the inconveniency of depending upon charity  in a country where   there is scarce sufficient for the necessities of nature  I therefore   thought it proper to take all the money and valuable effects in his   possession  to defray the expenses of my journey  As to the dis    tress this might throw him into  I never regarded that a moment    no more than I did his being my countryman  I despised the   narrowness of thought that made such accidental circumstances of         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 269     any weight  when they clashed with my own particular designs    and I esteemed the lesson I had taught him  to be more cautious   whom he placed his confidence in  a sufficient recompense for his   loss  From Spain  I directed my course to Germany  where the   political knowledge I acquired from my late friend s papers made   me so much taken notice of  that after some time  not disagreably   spent among the great  I was recommended to the prime minister   and favourite of the King of Poland  as a proper person to be en    trusted with the education of his only son  Not to disgrace this   character  I assumed a fictitious name and title  and gave out that I   had been obliged to leave my own country for an afiair of honour    My emplojrment gave me frequent opportunities of conversing with   the father of my pupil  in which I displayed my skill in politics to   such advantage  that I soon was admitted into his esteem and con    fidence  In this intercourse I had the honour of starting the first   hint of that project  which afterwards kindled a late war in Germany    and will immortalize his name  for he has had the ungenerous   meanness to assume it to himself  to all ages        Such a situation was sufficient to satisfy the desires of any other   man   but my ambition knew no bounds  I thought my patron   did not reward my merit as it deserved  and  in revenge  I resolved   to work his ruin  For this purpose  I entered into a correspondence   with several noblemen  who were his enemies  and  taking advantage   of the opportunities his confidence gave me of seeing his papers    copied some  and counterfeited others that I thought necessary to   my design  which was no less than to raise a civil war  in which the   minister should be sacrificed  and the master dethroned  But    just as my plot was ripe for execution  it was discovered  and I   hurried from a palace to a prison  where I was condemned to lan    guish out the rest of my days  my life being spared in compliance   with a delicacy of my patron  who thought it would be a disgrace   to him to have his son s tutor hanged  When I had lain here
