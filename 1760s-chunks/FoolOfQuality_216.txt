it could   be who lived in so expensive and superb a manner  Sir  said the   under keeper  there are few men now at liberty near so wealthy as   this gentleman  who has done us the honour to set up his staff of   rest in our house  His name is Sink  He is an attorney and an old   bachelor  turned of sixty years of age  He is in for several sums    amounting to upwards of nine thousand pounds  and he is reputed   to be worth above double that money      During the last twenty years  he behaved himself with the   strictest probity toward all men  and with the strictest appearance   of piety toward God  In the dark  in frost and snow  and all in    clemencies of weather he never missed attending morning service   at church  He was equally solicitous to be at evening prayer     and  whatever company he chanced to have with him  or how im    portant soever the business in which he was engaged  the moment   he heard the bell ring he would huddle up his papers and break   away without ceremony  He was eager in his inquiries to know   where the sacrament was soonest to be administered  and he never   missed receiving it at least once in the week  Whenever he heard   any profaneness or obscenity in the streets  he would stop to re    prove and expostulate with the offender  In short  he so perfectly   counterfeited or took off  as they call it  the real Christian  that   many looked to see him  like Enoch or Elijah  taken alive into   heaven      This perpetual parade of sanctity gave him such an eclat and   immeasurable credit  that he was left trustee and executor in a   multitude of wills   and numbers also deposited their substance in   his hands  in order to be laid out at interest on securities  and   so forth      Three months since  about the dawning  as his butcher happened   to pass by his door  he heard it open  and turning saw a number   of porters come out heavy laden  This gave him a kind of sus    picion  He let them all pass  and  walking softly after  he stepped   up to the hindmost  and offered him half a crown on condition of his         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  223     telling him where they were carrying those parcels  That I will    said the porter   for the secret  if such it is  is nothing to me    you know  In short  we are carrying them to the wharf  to be put   on board a boat that waits to take them in      The butcher said no more  but hurried away to the baker  and    as they both run to the office  they met the brewer by the way    They took out their respective actions  and  taking a constable with   them  they seized on good Mr  Sink  as he was stepping into a   coach and six to make the best of his way to Dover  He would   have paid them their money and discharged their actions on the   spot   but here the master  in whom he trusted  happened to leave   him in the lurch  As he had turned all his effects into money  and   his money into paper  he had not at hand wherewith to pay his   instant creditors  So they hurried him to jail  and before the   banks were open the matter was blown  and action after action   came pouring fast upon him      When he found himself thus at bay  he cast aside his disguise    and set them all at defiance  His creditors have since offered to   accept ten shillings  and some of them to accept five shillings  in   the pound   but he swears that he will never pay them a groat   for   he is now as liberal of his oaths and impious execrations  as he was   lately of his more impious profanation of gospel phrases  And   thus he daily revels in the sensual consumption of those wretches   whom he hath so inhumanly defrauded  while hundreds of   orphans and widows  and other miserables  perish for want of the   sustenance which one infernal appetite devours without remorse    Nay  several of his creditors are  at this very time  famishing in this   prison  while they see him feasting so lavishly upon their spoils      The gorge of my soul  cried Mr  Fentpn  the very gorge of my   soul rises against this demon   Can nothing be done to bring him   to punishment  Our parliament will surely interfere in such
