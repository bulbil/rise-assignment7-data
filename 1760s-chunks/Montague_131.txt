and I am not quite sure you are not in the right       I am extremely in love with my husband  yet chuse other men should regard me with complacency  am as fond of attracting the attention of the dear creatures as ever  and  though I do justice to your wit  understanding  sentiment  and all that  prefer Rivers s conversation infinitely to yours       Women cannot say civil things to each other  and if they could  they would be something insipid  whereas a male friend        Tis absolutely another thing  my dear  and the first system of ethics I write  I will have a hundred pages on the subject       Observe  my dear  I have not the least objection to your having a friendship for Fitzgerald  I am the best natured creature in the world  and the fondest of increasing the circle of my husband s innocent amusements       A propos to innocent amusements  I think your fair sister in law an exquisite politician  calling the pleasures to Temple at home  is the best method in the world to prevent his going abroad in pursuit of them       I am mortified I cannot be at your masquerade  it is my passion  and I have the prettiest dress in the world by me  I am half inclined to elope for a day or two       Adieu  Your faithful  A  FITZGERALD     LETTER CCXV   215   To Captain FITZGERALD   Bellfield  Nov  12   PLEASE to inform the little Bell  I won t allow her to spoil my Emily       I enter a caveat against male friendships  which are only fit for ladies of the salamandrine order       I desire to engross all Emily s kind propensities to myself  and should grudge the least share in her heart  or  if you please in her friendship  to an archangel       However  not to be too severe  since prudery expects women to have no propensities at all  I allow single ladies  of all ranks  sizes  ages  and complexions  to spread the veil of friendship between their hearts and the world        Tis the finest day I ever saw  though the middle of November  a dry soft west wind  the air as mild as in April  and an almost Canadian sunshine       I have been bathing in the clear stream  at the end of my garden  the same stream in which I laved my careless bosom at thirteen  an idea which gave me inconceivable delight  and the more  as my bosom is as gay and tranquil at this moment as in those dear hours of chearfulness and innocence       Of all local prejudices  that is the strongest as well as most pleasing  which attaches us to the place of our birth       Sweet home  only seat of true and genuine happiness       I am extremely in the humor to write a poem to the houshold gods       We neglect these amiable deities  but they are revenged  true pleasure is only to be found under their auspices       I know not how it is  my dear Fitzgerald  but I don t find my passion for the country abate       I still find the scenes around me lovely  though  from the change of season  less smiling than when I first fixed at Bellfield  we have rural business enough to amuse  not embarrass us  we have a small but excellent library of books  given us by my mother  she and Emily are two of the most pleasing companions on earth  the neighbourhood is full of agreable people  and  what should always be attended to in fixing in the country  of fortunes not superior to our own       The evenings grow long  but they are only the more jovial  I love the pleasures of the table  not for their own sakes  for no man is more indifferent on this subject  but because they promote social  convivial joy  and bring people together in good humor with themselves and each other       My Emily s suppers are enchanting  but our little income obliges us to have few  if I was rich  this would be my principal extravagance       To fill up my measure of content  Emily is pleased with my retirement  and finds all her happiness in my affection       We are so little alone  that I find our moments of unreserved conversation too short  whenever I leave her  I recollect a thousand things I had to say  a thousand new ideas to communicate  and am impatient for the hour of seeing again  without restraint  the most amiable and pleasing of woman kind       My happiness would be complete  if I did not sometimes see a cloud of anxiety on that dear countenance  which  however  is dissipated the moment my eyes meet hers       I am going to Temple s  and the chaise is at the door       Adieu  my dear friend   Your affectionate  ED  RIVERS     LETTER CCXVI   216   To Colonel RIVERS   Nov  14   SO you disapprove male
