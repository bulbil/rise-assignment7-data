the closet  The proportions of civility were weighed to a scruple  On the other hand  there were some suitors who  shocked at his cold indifference  cursed in their secret soul the necessity for their cringing before such a monkey of an idol  Others  on the contrary  were laughing in their sleeve at his gross and self sufficient air  But the scene was thrown away upon me  nor was I likely to profit by such a lesson  It was exactly the counterpart of my own behaviour  and I never thought of ascertaining whether my deportment was popular or offensive  so long as there was no violation of outward respect   Don Rodrigo accidentally casting a look towards me  left a gentleman  to whom he was speaking  without ceremony  and came to pay his respects with the most unaccountable tokens of high consideration  Ah  my dear colleague  exclaimed he  what occasion procures me the pleasure of seeing you here  Is there anything we can do for you  I told him my business  whereupon he assured me  in the most obliging terms  that the affair should be expedited within four and twenty hours  Not satisfied with these overwhelming condescensions  he conducted me to the door of his ante chamber  whither he never attended any but the nobility of first rank  His farewell was as flattering as his reception   What is the meaning of all this palaver  said I while retreating  has any raven croaked my entrance  and prophesied promotion to Calderona by my overthrow  Does he really languish for my friendship  or does he feel the ground giving way under his feet  and wish to save himself by clinging to the branches of my favour and protection  It seemed a moot point  which of these conjectures might be the right  The following day  on my return  his behaviour was of the same stamp  caresses and civilities poured in upon me in torrents  It is true that other people who attempted to speak to him  were ramped in exact proportion with the blandishments of his face towards me  He snarled at some  petrified others  and made the whole circle run the gauntlet of his displeasure  But they were all amply avenged by an occurrence  the relation of which may give a gentle hint to all the clerks and secretaries on the list of my readers   A man very plainly dressed  and certainly not looking at all like what he was  came up to Calderona and spoke to him about a memorial  stated to have been presented by himself to the Duke of Lerma  Don Rodrigo  without looking from his clothes up to his face  said in a sharp  ungracious tone    Who may you happen to be  honest man  They called me Francillo in my childhood  answered the stranger unabashed  my next style and title was that of Don Francillo de Zuniga  and my present name is the Count de Pedrosa  Calderona was all in a twitter at this discovery  and attempted to stammer out an excuse  when he found that he had to do with a man of the first quality  Sir  said he to the Count  I have to beg you  ten thousand pardons  but not knowing whom I had the honour to         I want none of your apologies  interrupted Francillo with proud indignation  they are as nauseous as your rudeness was unbecoming  Recollect henceforth  that a minister s secretary ought to receive all descriptions of people with good manners  You may be vain enough to affect the representative of your master  but the public know you for his menial servant   The haughty Don Rodrigo blushed blue at this rebuke  Yet it did not mend his manners one whit  On me it made a salutary impression  I determined to take care and ascertain the rank of my petitioners  before I gave a loose to the insolence of office  and to inflict torture only upon mutes  As Don Alphonso s patent was made out  I sent it by a purpose messenger  with a letter from the Duke of Lerma  announcing the royal favour  But I took no notice of my own share in the appointment  nor even accompanied it with a line  in the fond hope of announcing it by word of mouth  and surprising him agreeably  when he came to the court on occasion of taking the customary oaths       CH  III     Preparations for the marriage of Gil Blas  A spoke in the wheel of Hymen   AND now once more for my lovely Gabriela  We were to be married in a week  Preparations were making on both sides for the ceremony  Salero ordered a rich wardrobe for the bride  and I hired a waiting woman for her  a footman  and a gentleman usher of decent aspect and advanced years  The whole establishment was provided by Scipio  who longed more longingly than myself for the hour when we were to be fingering the fortune   On the evening before the happy day  I was supping with my father in law  the rest of the company being made up of uncles  aunts  and cousins of either sex and every degree  The part of a supple visaged son in law sat upon
