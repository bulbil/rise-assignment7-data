how  what  whose name  say  speak—Heaven and earth   cried the knight  with marks of the most violent emotion —Clarke  terrified at his looks  replied   I beg your pardon a thousand times  I did not say positively she did speak those words  but I apprehended she did speak them  Words  which may be taken or interpreted by law in a general or common sense  ought not to receive a strained or unusual construction  and ambiguous words — Speak  or be dumb for ever   exclaimed Sir Launcelot  in a terrific tone  laying his hand on his sword   What young lady  ha  What name did she call upon  —Clarke  falling on his knees  answered  not without stammering   Miss Aurelia Darnel  to the best of my recollection  she called upon Sir Launcelot Greaves  — Sacred powers   cried our adventurer   which way did the carriage proceed    When Tom told him that the coach quitted the post road  and struck away to the right at full speed  Sir Launcelot was seized with a pensive fit  his head sunk upon his breast  and he mused in silence for several minutes  with the most melancholy expression on his countenance  then recollecting himself  he assumed a more composed and cheerful air  and asked several questions with respect to the arms on the coach  and the liveries worn by the servants  It was in the course of this interrogation  that he discovered he had actually conversed with one of the footmen  who had brought back Crabshaw s horse  A circumstance that filled him with anxiety and chagrin  as he had omitted to inquire the name of his master  and the place to which the coach was travelling  though  in all probability  had he made these inquiries  he would have received very little satisfaction  there being reason to think the servants were enjoined secrecy   The knight  in order to meditate on this unexpected adventure  sat down by his old friend  and entered into a reverie  which lasted about a quarter of an hour  and might have continued longer had it not been interrupted by the voice of Crabshaw  who bawled aloud   Look to it  my masters—as you brew you must drink—this shall be a dear day s work to some of you  for my part  I say nothing—the braying ass eats little grass—one barber shaves not so close  but another finds a few stubble— you wanted to catch a capon  and you ve stole a cat—he that takes up his lodgings in a stable  must be contented to lie upon litter    The knight  desirous of knowing the cause that prompted Timothy to apothegmatise in this manner  looked through the grate  and perceived the squire fairly set in the stocks  surrounded by a mob of people  When he called to him  and asked the reason of this disgraceful restraint  Crabshaw replied   There s no cake  but there s another of the same make —who never climbed  never fell—after clouds comes clear weather   T is all along of your honour  I ve met with this preferment  no deservings of my own  but the interest of my master  Sir Knight  if you will slay the justice  hang the constable  release your squire  and burn the town  your name will be famous in story  but  if you are content  I am thankful  Two hours are soon spent in such good company  in the meantime  look to  un  jailor  there s a frog in the stocks    Sir Launcelot  incensed at this affront offered to his servant  advanced to the prison door  but found it fast locked  and when he called to the turnkey  he was given to understand  that he himself was prisoner  Enraged at this intimation  he demanded at whose suit  and was answered through the wicket   At the suit of the King  in whose name I will hold you fast  with God s assistance    The knight s looks now began to lighten  he rolled his eyes around  and snatching up an oaken bench  which three ordinary men could scarce have lifted from the ground  he  in all likelihood  would have shattered the door in pieces  had not he been restrained by the interposition of Mr  Clarke  who entreated him to have a little patience  assuring him he would suggest a plan that would avenge himself amply on the justice  without any breach of the peace   I say the justice   added Tom   because it must be his doing  He is a little petulant sort of a fellow  ignorant of the law  guilty of numberless irregularities  and if properly managed  may  for this here act of arbitrary power  be not only cast in a swingeing sum  but even turned out of the commission with disgrace    This was a very seasonable hint  in consequence of which the bench was softly replaced  and Captain Crowe deposited the poker  with which he had armed himself  to second the efforts of Sir Launcelot  They now  for the first time  perceived that Ferret had disappeared  and  upon inquiry  found that he was
