ceed   When he has ended  if he omits anything  you may then   inform us further  â€” Pray  sir  do proceed          Why  really  madam    continued he  under some apparent   confusion     I am at a loss how to act  and had much rather be   excused   however  I must beg leave to observe  that for my own   part  I do not believe a single syllable of the stories of ghosts and   apparitions  and devils  and such like stuff that ever was told    though this story  in particular  is told in a manner  and confirmed   with circumstances not easily to be contradicted        This solemn preface raised the curiosity of them all to a torture    and alarmed apprehensions that would not admit of a moment s   suspense    Dear sir  pray proceed    echoed from an hundred   mouths at once  as they pressed closer to him      The gentleman bowed and continued     The whole company   was now thrown  into a confusion as great as that of the dancers     they had all reckoned a seventh person  and the coimoisseiu s in   particular had observed that one of them had shown greater agility    and cut higher than any one they had ever seen before  and indeed   than they thought it possible for any human person to do  This   hint alarmed the whole house  and it was immediately concluded   that the devil had maliciously joined in the dance on purpose to   spoil their sport   an opinion  which one or two unlucky circum    stances seemed to give weight to  which were  that all the dancers   had been dressed like devils  the opera being The Fall of Man  and   the dance exhibited  as a triumph of the devils upon the occasion    that it was acted on a Sunday evening  Trifling as these circum    stances really were  they threw the whole audience into a consterna    tion   some directly fancied the candles burnt blue  others that the   place smelt strongly of sulphur   and one more impudently foolish   than all the rest  insisted that he had observed the cloven foot     but what was most surprising of all  the cardinal  who could not   be suspected of superstition  was so affected by it  that he ordered   the house to be dismissed directly  and that opera never to be   performed again  nor any other on a Sunday  which was observed   during his life  and for some time after            118 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     It is impossible for words to describe the situation of the company   at the conclusion of this story  At the mention of the candles burn    ing blue  all turned their eyes about  and fancied the same   as to    heir smelling sulphur  it was more than imagination â€”  the pre    tended constable having taken an opportunity  while they were   all in confusion  to throw  unperceived  a composition which he had   brought with him on purpose  into the fire  which had filled the   room with a most sulphurous smell â€” and more than one of the   company declared they thought they saw a cloven foot  or some    thing very like it  fly out of the window      The scene was now changed to an appearance really frightful    Every lengthened visage was as pale as death  every haggard eye   staring in wild affright  The old lady to whom the tale had been   particularly addressed  confirmed every syllable of it  and added   many circumstances from secret histories of her own immediate   invention   and every one present had some similar story to tell in   support of it  till they at length terrified one another to that   degree that they were afraid to look around  or even raise their voices   to bid their servants prepare for their departure      The gentleman  pleased at the success of his artifice  resolved to   improve it to the utmost  and take advantage of their present   situation to work them up to some action that should make them   ashamed  at least  ever to be guilty of the like profanation of that   sacred day again     Defend us  Heaven     exclaimed he  fixing   his eyes with horror on one of the windows  What can that be         This completed the terror   they all believed the devil was re    turning to destroy them  for the boldest of them all had not the   spirit to turn their eyes to see what he looked
