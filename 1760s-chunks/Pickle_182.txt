 not refuse the order  yet  being no stranger to the malevolence of the  mother  which  together with Gamaliel s simplicity  was notorious in the  county  he sent an intimation of what had happened to the garrison  upon  which a couple of sentinels were placed on the gate  and at the pressing  solicitation of the lover  as well as the desire of the commodore  her  brother  and aunt  Julia was wedded without further delay  the ceremony  being performed by Mr  Jolter  because the parish priest prudently  declined any occasion of giving offence  and the curate was too much in  the interest of their enemies to be employed in that office   This domestic concern being settled to the satisfaction of our hero  he  escorted her next day to the house of her husband  who immediately wrote  a letter to her father  declaring his reasons for having thus superseded  his authority  and Mrs  Pickle s mortification was unspeakable   That the new married couple might be guarded against all insult  our  young gentleman and his friend Hatchway  with their adherents  lodged  in Mr  Clover s house for some weeks  during which they visited their  acquaintance in the neighbourhood  according to custom  When the  tranquility of their family was perfectly established  and the contract  of the marriage executed in the presence of the old commodore and his  lady  who gave her niece five hundred pounds to purchase jewels and  clothes  Mr  Peregrine could no longer restrain his impatience to see  his dear Emily  and told his uncle  that next day he proposed to ride  across the country  in order to visit his friend Gauntlet  whom he had  not heard of for a long time   The old gentleman  looking steadfastly in his face   Ah  D  n your  cunning   said he   I find the anchor holds fast  I did suppose as how  you would have slipt your cable  and changed your berth  but  I see   when a young fellow is once brought up by a pretty wench  he may man his  capstans and viol block  if he wool  but he ll as soon heave up the Pike  of Teneriffe  as bring his anchor aweigh  Odds heartlikins  had I known  the young woman was Ned Gauntlet s daughter  I shouldn t have thrown out  signal for leaving off chase    Our adventurer was not a little surprised to hear the commodore talk  in this style  and immediately conjectured that his friend Godfrey  had informed him of the whole affair  Instead of listening to this  approbation of his flame  with those transports of joy which he would  have felt  had he retained his former sentiments  he was chagrined at  Trunnion s declaration  and offended at the presumption of the young    6 22 15  3 45 PM   soldier  in presuming to disclose the secret with which he had entrusted  him  Reddening with these reflections  he assured the commodore that he  never had serious thoughts of matrimony  so that if any person had told  him he was under any engagement of that kind  he had abused his ear  for  he protested that he would never contract such attachments without his  knowledge and express permission   Trunnion commended him for his prudent resolution  and observed  that   though no person mentioned to him what promises had passed betwixt him  and his sweetheart  it was very plain that he had made love to her  and  therefore it was to be supposed that his intentions were honourable  for  he could not believe he was such a rogue in his heart  as to endeavour  to debauch the daughter of a brave officer  who had served his country  with credit and reputation  Notwithstanding this remonstrance  which  Pickle imputed to the commodore s ignorance of the world  he set out for  the habitation of Mrs  Gauntlet  with the unjustifiable sentiments of a  man of pleasure  who sacrifices every consideration to the desire of his  ruling appetite  and  as Winchester lay in his way  resolved to visit  some of his friends who lived in that place  It was in the house of one  of these that he was informed of Emilia s being then in town with her  mother  upon which he excused himself from staying to drink tea  and  immediately repaired to their lodgings  according to the directions he  had received   When he arrived at the door  instead of undergoing that perturbation of  spirits  which a lover in his interesting situation might be supposed to  feel  he suffered no emotion but that of vanity and pride  favoured with  an opportunity of self gratification  and entered his Emilia s apartment  with the air of a conceited petit maitre  rather than that of the  respectful admirer  when he visits the object of his passion  after an  absence of seventeen months   The young lady  having been very much disobliged at his mortifying  neglect of her brother s letter  had summoned all her own pride and  resolution to her aid
