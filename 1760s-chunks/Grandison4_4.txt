have not joy  you have comfort  in your severity   My heart as well as my cheek glowed at the praises the Earl and the Lady both joined in  with a fervor that was creditable to their own hearts  of Sir Charles Grandison  while they told us what this man  and hat woman of quality or consideration said of him  Who would not be good  What is life without reputation  Do we not wish to be remembered with honour after death  And what a share of it has this excellent man in his life —May nothing for the honour sake   9 of human nature  to which he is so great an ornament  ever happen to tarnish it   They made me an hundred fine compliments  I could not but be pleased at standing well in their opinion  But  believe me  my dear  I did not enjoy their praises of me  as I did those they gave him  Indeed I had the presumption  from the approbation given to what they said of him by my own heart  to imagine myself a sharer in them  tho  not in his merits  Oh  Lucy  ought there not to have been a relation between us  since what I have said  from what I found in myself on hearing him praised  is a demonstration of a regard for him superior to the love of self   Adieu  my Lucy  I know I have all your prayers   Adieu  my Dear   LETTER II  Miss BYRON  In continuation   Sat  April 1   DR  Bartlett is one of the kindest as well as best of men  I believe he loves me as if I were his own child  But good men must be affectionate men  He received but this morning a letter from Sir Charles  and hastened to communicate some of its contents to me  tho  I could pretend to no other motive but curiosity for wishing to be acquainted with the proceedings of his patron   Sir Charles dined  as he had intended  with Sir Hargrave and his friends  He complains in his letter of a riotous day     Yet I think  adds he  it has led me into some useful reflexions  It is not indeed agreeable to be the spectator of riot  but how easy to ••un being a partaker in it  How easy to avoid the too freely circling glass  if a man is known to have established a rule to himself  from which he will not depart  and if it be not refused sullenly  but mirth and good humour   10 the more studiously kept up  by the person  who would else indeed be looked upon as a spy on unguarded folly  I heartily pitied a young man  who  I dare say  has a good heart  but from false shame durst not assert the freedom that every Englishman would claim a right to  in almost every other instance  He had once put by the glass  and excused himself on account of his health  but on being laughed at for a sober dog  as they phrased it  and asked  if his spouse had not lectured him before he came out  he gave way to the wretched raillery  Nor could I interfere at such a noisy moment with effect  They had laughed him out of his caution before I could be heard  and I left him there at nine o clock trying with Bagenhall which should drink the deepest       I wish  my good Dr  Bartlett  you would throw together some serious considerations on this subject  You could touch it delicately  and such a discourse would not be unuseful to some few of our neighbours even at Grandison hall  What is it  that  in this single article  men sacrifice to false shame and false glory  Reason  health  fortune  personal elegance  the peace and order of their families  and all the comfort and honour of their after years  How peevish  how wretched  is the decline of a man worn out with intemperance  In a cool hour  resolutions might be formed  that should stand the attack of a boisterous jest      I obtained leave from Dr  Bartlett  to transcribe this part of the letter  I thought my uncle would be pleased with it   It was near ten at night  before Sir Charles got to Lord W s  tho  but three miles from Sir Hargrave s  My Lord rejoiced to see him  and  after first compliments  asked him  if he had thought of what he had undertaken for him  Sir Charles told him  that he was the more desirous of seeing him in his way to   11 the Hall  because he wanted to know if his Lordship held his mind as to marriage  He assured him he did  and would sign and seal to whatever he should stipulate for him   I wished for a copy of this part of Sir Charles s letter  for the sake of my aunt  whose delicacy would  I thought  be charmed with it  He has been so good as to say  he would transcribe it for me  I will inlose it  Lucy  and you will read it here
