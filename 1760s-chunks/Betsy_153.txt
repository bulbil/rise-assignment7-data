on his being kept perfectly quiet       It is not to be doubted  but that  on this information  she went with as   little noise as possible up to her chamber  where Nanny  as she was   putting her to bed  confirmed to her what the footman had said  and   added  that she had heard the doctor tell Mrs  Barns  as he was going   out  that he was very apprehensive his patient s disorder would not be   easily remedied       Distempers of the body  which arise from those of the mind  are  indeed    much more difficult to be cured than those which proceed from mere   natural causes  Mr  Goodman s resentment for the ill usage he had   sustained from a woman he had so tenderly loved  awhile kept up his   spirits  and hindered him from feeling the cruel sting  which preyed   upon his vitals  and insensibly slackened the strings of life  but the   first hurry being over  and the lawyer having told him that every thing   was drawn up  and his cause would be brought before the Commons in a few   days  he sunk beneath the apprehensions  the thoughts of appearing   before the doctors of the civil law  to several of whom he was known  to   prove his own dishonour  the talk of the town  the whispers  the   grimaces  the ridicule  which he was sensible this affair would occasion   when exposed  the pity of some  and the contempt he must expect from   others  all these things  though little regarded by him while at a   distance  now they came more near at hand  and just ready to fall upon   him  gave him such a shock  as all the courage he had assumed was not   sufficient to enable him to resist       He was seized at once with a violent fit of an apoplexy at a   coffee house  where a surgeon being immediately sent for  he was let   blood  as is common in such cases  This operation soon recovered him  so   far as speech and motion  but reason had not power to re assume her seat   in his distracted brain for many hours  he was brought home in a   chair  the surgeon attended him  saw him put into bed  and sat by him a   considerable time  but  finding him rather worse than better  told Mrs    Barns  he durst not proceed any farther  and that they must have   recourse to a physician  which was accordingly done       This gentleman  who was esteemed the most skilful of his profession    hearing Mr  Goodman frequently cry out   My heart  my heart   laid his   hand upon his bosom  and found  by the extraordinary pulsations there    that he had symptoms of an inward convulsion  wrote a prescription  and   ordered he should be kept extremely quiet       Towards morning  he grew more composed  and  by degrees  recovered the   use of his understanding as perfectly as ever  but his limbs were so   much weakened by that severe attack the fit had made upon him  that he   could not sit up in his bed without support  The physician  however  had   great hopes of him  said his imbecillity proceeded only from a fever of   the nerves  which he doubted not but to abate  and that he would be well   in a few days  How uncertain  how little to be depended upon  is art  in   some cases  Mr  Goodman felt that within himself which gave the lye to   all appearances  and  fully convinced that the hand of death had seized   upon his heart  would not defer a moment putting all his affairs in such   a posture as should leave no room for contention among the parties   concerned  after his decease  he began with sending for Mr  Thoughtless    and consigned over to him the whole fortunes of Mr  Francis and Miss   Betsy  the latter being obliged  as not being yet of age  to chuse him   for her guardian in form  Having thus acquitted himself  in the most   honourable manner  of the trust reposed in him for the children of his   friend  he considered what was best to be done in relation to those of   his own blood  By his death  the intended process against Lady Mellasin   would be prevented  and consequently the third part of his effects would   devolve on her  as being the widow of a citizen  he  therefore  having   consulted with his lawyer if such a thing were practicable  made a deed   of gift to his nephew  Mr  Edward Goodman  of all his money in the Bank    stocks  and other publick funds
