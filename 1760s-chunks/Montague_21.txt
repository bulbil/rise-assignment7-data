  Your faithful  EMILY MONTAGUE     LETTER XX   20   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Silleri  Sept  24   I DECLARE off at once  I will not be a squaw  I admire their talking of the liberty of savages  in the most essential point  they are slaves  the mothers marry their children without ever consulting their inclinations  and they are obliged to submit to this foolish tyranny  Dear England  where liberty appears  not as here among these odious savages  wild and ferocious like themselves  but lovely  smiling  led by the hand of the Graces  There is no true freedom any where else  They may talk of the privilege of chusing a chief  but what is that to the dear English privilege of chusing a husband       I have been at an Indian wedding  and have no patience  Never did I see so vile an assortment       Adieu  I shall not be in good humor this month   Yours   A  FERMOR     LETTER XXI   21   To JOHN TEMPLE  Esq  Pall Mall   Montreal  Sept  24   WHAT you say  my dear friend  is more true than I wish it was  our English women of character are generally too reserved  their manner is cold and forbidding  they seem to think it a crime to be too attractive  they appear almost afraid to please        Tis to this ill judged reserve I attribute the low profligacy of too many of our young men  the grave faces and distant behaviour of the generality of virtuous women fright them from their acquaintance  and drive them into the society of those wretched votaries of vice  whose conversation debases every sentiment of their souls       With as much beauty  good sense  sensibility  and softness  at least  as any women on earth  no women please so little as the English  depending on their native charms  and on those really amiable qualities which envy cannot deny them  they are too careless in acquiring those enchanting nameless graces  which no language can define  which give resistless force to beauty  and even supply its place where it is wanting       They are satisfied with being good  without considering that unadorned virtue may command esteem  but will never excite love  and both are necessary in marriage  which I suppose to be the state every woman of honor has in prospect  for I own myself rather incredulous as to the assertions of maiden aunts and cousins to the contrary  I wish my amiable countrywomen would consider one moment  that virtue is never so lovely as when dressed in smiles  the virtue of women should have all the softness of the sex  it should be gentle  it should be even playful  to please       There is a lady here  whom I wish you to see  as the shortest way of explaining to you all I mean  she is the most pleasing woman I ever beheld  independently of her being one of the handsomest  her manner is irresistible  she has all the smiling graces of France  all the blushing delicacy and native softness of England       Nothing can be more delicate  my dear Temple  than the manner in which you offer me your estate in Rutland  by way of anticipating your intended legacy  it is however impossible for me to accept it  my father  who saw me naturally more profuse than became my expectations  took such pains to counterwork it by inspiring me with the love of independence  that I cannot have such an obligation even to you       Besides  your legacy is left on the supposition that you are not to marry  and I am absolutely determined you shall  so that  by accepting this mark of your esteem  I should be robbing your younger children       I have not a wish to be richer whilst I am a batchelor  and the only woman I ever wished to marry  the only one my heart desires  will be in three weeks the wife of another  I shall spend less than my income here  shall I not then be rich  To make you easy  know I have four thousand pounds in the funds  and that  from the equality of living here  an ensign is obliged to spend near as much as I am  he is inevitably ruined  but I save money       I pity you  my friend  I am hurt to hear you talk of happiness in the life you at present lead  of finding pleasure in possessing venal beauty  you are in danger of acquiring a habit which will vitiate your taste  and exclude you from that state of refined and tender friendship for which nature formed a heart like yours  and which is only to be found in marriage  I need not add  in a marriage of choice       It has been said that love marriages are generally unhappy  nothing is more false  marriages of meer inclination will always be so  passion alone being concerned  when that is gratified  all tenderness ceases of course  but love  the gay child of sympathy and esteem  is  when attended by delicacy  the only
