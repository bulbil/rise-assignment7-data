needed not a second invitation  but Mr  Brayl  who was a diligent and excellent officer  could not be persuaded to sleep out of the ship  However  he supped with us  and after having drank a chearful glass  set out for the vessel  which was not above three miles from the place  escorted by a couple of stout Negroes  whom Mr  Thomson ordered to conduct him —Never were two friends more happy in the conversation of one another than we  for the time it lasted  I related to him the particulars of our attempt upon Carthagena    321 of which he had heard but an imperfect account  and he gratified me with a narration of every little incident of his life since we parted —He assured me  it was with the utmost reluctance  he could resist his inclination of coming down to Port Royal to see Morgan and me  of whom he had heard no tidings since the day of our separation  but that he was restrained by the fear of being detained as a deserter —He told me  that when he heard my voice in the dark  he was almost as much surprized as I was at seeing him afterwards  and in the confidence of friendship  disclosed a passion he entertained for the only daughter of the gentleman with whom he lived  who  by his description  was a very amiable young lady  and did not distain his addresses  that he was very much favoured by her parents  and did not despair of obtaining their consent to the match  which would at once render him independent of the world —I congratulated him on his good fortune  which he protested should never make him forget his friend  and towards morning we betook ourselves to rest     Next day he accompanied me to the ship  where Mr  Brayl entertained him at dinner  and having spent the afternoon together  he took his leave of us in the evening  after he had forced upon me ten pistoles  as a small token of his affection —In short  while we staid here  we saw one another every day  and generally eat at the same table  which was plentifully supplied by him  with all kinds of poultry  butcher s meat  oranges  limes  lemons  pine aples  Madeira wine  and excellent rum  so that this small interval of ten days  was by far the most agreeable period of my life     322 At length  the Lizzard arrived  and as my patients were all fit for duty  they and I were ordered on board of her  where I understood from Mr  Tomlins  that there was a dryness between the lieutenant and him  on my account  that rancorous villain having taken the opportunity of my absence  to fill the captain s ears with a thousand scandalous stories  to my prejudice  among other things affirming  that I had been once transported for theft  and that when I was in the Thunder man of war I had been whipt for the same crime —The surgeon  on the other hand  having heard my whole story from my own mouth  defended me strenuously  and in the course of that good natured office  recounted all the instances of Crampley s malice against me  while I remained on board of that ship —Which declaration  while it satisfied the captain of my innocence  made the lieutenant as much my defender s enemy as mine  This infernal behaviour of Crampley  with regard to me  added such fuel to my former resentment  that at certain times  I was quite beside myself with the desire of revenge  and was even tempted to pistol him on the quarter deck  though an infamous death must inevitably have been my reward —But the surgeon  who was my confident  argued against such a desperate action so effectually  that I stifled the flame which consumed me for the present  and resolved to wait a more convenient opportunity —In the mean time  that Mr  Tomlins might be the more convinced of the wrongs I suffered by this fellow s slander  I begged he would go and visit Mr  Thomson  whose wonderful escape I had made him acquainted with  and   323 enquire of him into the particulars of my conduct  while he was my fellow mate  This the surgeon complied with  more through curiosity to see a person whose fate had been so extraordinary  than to confirm his good opinion of me  which  he assured me  was already firmly established —He therefore set out for the dwellingplace of my friend  with a letter of introduction from me  and being received with all the civility and kindness I expected  returned to the ship  not only satisfied with my character  beyond the power of doubt or insinuation  but also charmed with the affability and conversation of Thomson  who loaded him and me with presents of fresh stock  liquors and fruit  As he would not venture to come and see us on board  left Crampley should know and detain him  when the time of our departure approached  I obtained leave to go and bid him farewell —After we had vowed an everlasting friendship  he pressed upon me a purse with four double dubloons  which I refused as long as I could  without giving umbrage  and having cordially embraced each other  I
