as he had represented to them       She made  for a great while  very little reply to all this  her head was   now  indeed  very full of something else  she sat in a kind of reverie    and had a perfect absence of mind during this latter part of their   discourse  she heard  but heard without attention  and without   considering the weight of any thing they urged  yet  at last  merely to   get rid of their importunities and presence  that she might be alone to   indulge her own meditations  she said as they said  and promised to do   whatever they required of her       Mr  Thoughtless having now  as he imagined  brought her to the bent he   wished  took his leave  but Mr  Francis staid some time longer  nor had    perhaps  gone so soon  if Miss Betsy had not discovered a certain   restlessness  which made him think she would be glad to be alone       This was the first time she had ever desired his absence  but now    indeed  most heartily did so  she had got a caprice in her brain  which   raised ideas there she was in pain till she had modelled  and brought to   the perfection she wanted  What her brother had cursorily mentioned   concerning the picture of Mr  Trueworth  had made a much deeper   impression on her mind than all the serious discourse he had afterwards   entertained her with  she longed to have in her possession so exact a   resemblance of a man who had once loved her  and for whom she had always   the most high esteem  though her pride would never suffer her to shew it   to any one who professed himself her lover   This picture   said she     by looking on it  will remind me of the obligation I have to him  I   might forget it else  and I would not be ungrateful  though it is not in   my nature to love  I may  nay  I ought  after what he has done for me    to have a friendship for him        She then began to consider whether there was a possibility of becoming   the mistress of what she so much desired  she had never given her mind   to plotting  she had never been at the pains of any contrivances but   how to ornament her dress  or place the patches of her face with the   most graceful art  and was extremely at a loss what strategem to form   for the getting this picture into her hands  at first  she thought of   going to the painter  and bribing him to take a copy of it for her own   use   But then   said she   a copy taken from a copy goes still farther   from the original  besides  he may betray me  or he may not have time to   do it  and I would leave nothing to chance  No  I must have the very   picture that my brother saw  that I may be sure is like  for I know he   is a judge        Suppose   cried she again   I go under the pretence of sitting for my   picture  and look over all his pieces  I fancy I may find an opportunity   of slipping Trueworth s into my pocket  I could send the value of it the   next day  so the man would be no sufferer by it        This project seemed feasible to her for a time  but she afterwards   rejected it  on account she could not be sure of committing the theft so   artfully as not to be detected in the fact  several other little   strategems succeeded this in her inventive brain  all which  on second   thoughts  she found either impossible to be executed  or could promise   no certainty in their effects       Sleep was no less a stranger to her eyes this night than it had been the   preceding one  yet of how different a nature were the agitations that   kept her waking  in the first  the shock of the insult she had   sustained  and the shame of her receiving her protection from him by   whom  of all men living  she was at least willing to be obliged  took up   all her thoughts  in the second  she was equally engrossed by the   impatience of having something to preserve him eternally in her mind       After long revolving within herself  she at last hit upon the means of   accomplishing her desires  the risque she ran  indeed  was somewhat   bold  but as it succeeded without suspicion  she had only to guard   against accidents that might occasion a future discovery of
