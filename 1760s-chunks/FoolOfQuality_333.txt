friend whom he found   so deeply afflicted for him      Mr  Meekly  said he  let us not weep for the living  but rather   for the dead  for those who are yet in the vale of mortality    Shall we mourn the condition of angels  shall we lament that   a weight of glory is fallen on those whom we loved   No   let us   rather rejoice in the prospect of being speedily partakers       When supper was over  Harry laid hold of the first interval   of converse to inquire after his friends in town  more especially   Mr  Clement  his Arabella  and their little Dicky  They are come    said Mr  Clinton  to sudden and great affluence  Old Clement is   thoroughly reconciled to his son  and is cloatingly fond of Arabella   and her child  I am glad of it with all my heart  cried Harry    clapping his hands   but pray  how did this matter come about    sir   By an event  my dear  in which the arm of Providence was   signally visible  Old Clement s supposed wife was detected  and   is dead  as is also her paramour  the villain who betrayed  and   lately also attempted to murder  your Hammel  His history is   wonderful   but it is long  and too horrid to relate      What an astonishing distance there is  exclaimed the earl    between the characters and dispositions of man and man  And   how does my brother  my revered Harry Clinton  rise supreme   above all his species  in every excellence  in every virtue  scarce   less than divine       Oh  my lord  I am persuaded  said Mr  Clinton  that could it   please God at this instant to withdraw from me the influence of         THE FOOL OF QUALITY          367         his holy and happy Spirit  I should become altogether as evil as   the worst  as vile as the vilest      I cannot think so  my brother  replied the earl   you would still   continue a rational and free creature  There is certainly a dis    tinction in the nature of things   There is the beautiful and de    formed  the amiable and detestable   your judgment would approve   the one and reject the other   and your freedom of agency would   act conformable to your election      Ah  my lord   cried Mr  Clinton  what things  what beauty  what   amiableness  what freedom is this that you speak of  Have you   found out another universe  or another deity beside HIM in whom   our life subsists  Are there any things in nature save the things   of our God  Or what beauty or amiableness can they possibly   exhibit  save what they derive from him   save some quality or   impregnation  some manifestation or impression  of his own beauty   or amiableness      To make this matter clear  let us go somewhat deeper  quite   back  if you please  my lord  to the very birth of things      Throughout nature  we find that God can impart to his creatures   a being  an identity  a fire of life  an intelligence or sagacity  a   consciousness  a force or action  a will and a freedom  distinct from   himself  and distinct from each other   and this is the utmost extent   of creaturely nature  whether respecting the powers that are in   hell or in heaven   whether respecting the highest seraphims that   are in bliss  or the lowest fallen spirits in perdition      Now all these powers or high prerogatives  although distinct   from God  are infinitely far from being independent of him   for he   will not  he cannot  depart from his supremacy  nor that universality   of essence  by and in which alone all essences subsist      He can  indeed  impart the fore mentioned powers to any limited   degree that he pleases   but then  in their highest degree of fire    life  or sagacity  force  action  or freedom  you will perceive  on   the slightest reflection  that there is nothing of the beautiful or   amiable that you spoke of  but that they are equally applicable    and may be equally exercised to evil or good purposes  according   to the nature or disposition of the agent      I have already specified the many great and wonderful powers   that God can impart to his creatures distinctly  though not in    dependently  from himself  But
