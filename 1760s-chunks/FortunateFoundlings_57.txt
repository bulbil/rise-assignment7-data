placed       Hitherto he had been successful beyond his hopes  but the greatest   difficulty was not yet surmounted  he doubted not but as such secrecy   had been used in the carrying her from Paris  and of the place to which   she had been conveyed  that the same circumspection would be preserved   in concealing her from the sight of any stranger that should come to the   monastry   he invented many pretences  but none seemed satisfactory to   himself  therefore could not expect they would pass upon   others   Sometimes he thought of disguising himself in the habit of a   woman  his youth  and the delicacy of his complexion making him imagine   he might impose on the abbess and the nuns for such  but then he feared   being betrayed  by not being able to answer the questions which would in   all probability be asked him   He endeavoured to find out some person   that was acquainted there  but tho  he asked all the gentlemen  which   were a great many  that dined at the same Hotel with him  he was at as   great a loss as ever  He went to the chapel every hour that mass was   said  but could flatter himself with no other satisfaction from that than   the empty one of knowing he was under the same roof with her  for the   gallery in which the ladies sit  pensioners  as well as those who have   taken the veil  are so closely grated  that it is impossible for those   below to distinguish any object       He was almost distracted when he had been there three or four days   without being able to find any expedient which he could think likely to   succeed   he knew not what to resolve on   time pressed him to pursue   his journey   every day  every hour that he lost from prosecuting the   glorious hopes he had in view  struck ten thousand daggers to his   soul   but then to go without informing the dear object of his wishes   how great a part she had in inspiring his ambition   without assuring   her of his eternal constancy and faith  and receiving some soft   condescensions from her to enable him to support so long an absence as   he in all probability must endure   All this  I say  was a shock to   thought  which  had he not been relieved from  would have perhaps abated   great part of that spirit which it was necessary for him to preserve  in   order to agree with the recommendatory letters he carried with him       He was just going out of the chapel full of unquiet meditations  when   passing by the confessional  a magdalen curiously painted which hung   near it attracted his eyes  as he was admiring the piece  something fell   from above and hit against his arm  he stooped to take it up  and found   it a small ivory tablet  he looked up  but could see the shadow of   nothing behind the grate  imagining it only an accident  and not knowing   to whom to return it  he put it in his pocket  but was no sooner out of   the chapel than curiosity excited him to see what it contained  which he   had no sooner done than in the first leaf he found these words           As I imagine you did not come this long journey   without a desire to see me  it would be too ungrateful   not to assist your endeavours   come a little before   vespers  and enquire of the portress for mademoiselle   du Pont   say you are her brother  and leave the rest to me           There was no name subscribed  but the dear characters  tho  evidently   wrote in haste and with a pencil  which made some alteration in the   fineness of the strokes  convinced him it came from no other than   Charlotta  and never were any hours so tedious to him as those which   past between the receiving this appointment  and that of the   fulfilling it       At length the wish d for time arrived  and he repaired to the gate    where telling the portress  as he was ordered  that he was the brother   of mademoiselle du Pont  he was immediately brought into the parlour    where he had not waited long before a young lady appeared behind the   grate  as he found it was not her he expected  he was a little at a   loss  and not without some apprehensions that his imagination had   deceived him  I know not  madame  said he  if chance has not made me   mistaken for some happier person   I thought to find a sister here   No    replied she laughing
