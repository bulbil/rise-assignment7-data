my vanity was gratified by the flattering preference she gave me to the rest of my sex  I fancied this all  and imagined I could cease seeing the little syren whenever I pleased        I was  however  mistaken  love stole upon me imperceptibly  and en badinant  I was enslaved  when I only thought myself amused       We have not yet seen Miss Montague  we go down on Friday to Berkshire  Bell having some letters for her  which she was desired to deliver herself       I will write to you again the moment I have seen her       The invitation Mr  and Mrs  Temple have been so obliging as to give us  is too pleasing to ourselves not to be accepted  we also expect with impatience the time of visiting you at your farm       Adieu   Your affectionate  J  FITZGERALD     LETTER CLXXIX   179   To Captain FITZGERALD   Stamford  Sept  16  Evening   BEING here on some business  my dear friend  I receive your letter in time to answer it to night       We hope to be in town this day seven night  and I flatter myself  my dearest Emily will not delay my happiness many days longer  I grudge you the pleasure of seeing her on Friday       I triumph greatly in your having been seduced into matrimony  because I never knew a man more of a turn to make an agreable husband  it was the idea that occurred to me the first moment I saw you       Do you know  my dear Fitzgerald  that  if your little syren had not anticipated my purpose  I had designs upon you for my sister       Through that careless  inattentive look of yours  I saw so much right sense  and so affectionate a heart  that I wished nothing so much as that she might have attached you  and had laid a scheme to bring you acquainted  hoping the rest from the merit so conspicuous in you both       Both are  however  so happily disposed of elsewhere  that I have no reason to regret my scheme did not succeed       There is something in your person  as well as manner  which I am convinced must be particularly pleasing to women  with an extremely agreable form  you have a certain manly  spirited air  which promises them a protector  a look of understanding  which is the indication of a pleasing companion  a sensibility of countenance  which speaks a friend and a lover  to which I ought to add  an affectionate  constant attention to women  and a polite indifference to men  which above all things flatters the vanity of the sex       Of all men breathing  I should have been most afraid of you as a rival  Mrs  Fitzgerald has told me  you have said the same thing of me        Happily  however  our tastes were different  the two amiable objects of our tenderness were perhaps equally lovely  but it is not the meer form  it is the character that strikes  the fire  the spirit  the vivacity  the awakened manner  of Miss Fermor won you  whilst my heart was captivated by that bewitching languor  that seducing softness  that melting sensibility  in the air of my sweet Emily  which is  at least to me  more touching than all the sprightliness in the world       There is in true sensibility of soul  such a resistless charm  that we are even affected by that of which we are not ourselves the object  we feel a degree of emotion at being witness to the affection which another inspires        Tis late  and my horses are at the door       Adieu  Your faithful  ED  RIVERS     LETTER CLXXX   180   To Miss MONTAGUE  Rose hill  Berkshire   Temple house  Sept  16   I HAVE but a moment  my dearest Emily  to tell you heaven favors your tenderness  it removes every anxiety from two of the worthiest and most gentle of human hearts       You and my brother have both lamented to me the painful necessity you were under  of reducing my mother to a less income than that to which she had been accustomed       An unexpected event has restored to her more than what her tenderness for my brother had deprived her of        A relation abroad  who owed every thing to her father s friendship  has sent her  as an acknowledgement of that friendship  a deed of gift  settling on her four hundred pounds a year for life       My brother is at Stamford  and is yet unacquainted with this agreable event       You will hear from him next post       Adieu  my dear Emily   Your affectionate  L  TEMPLE   END OF VOL  III       THE  HISTORY  OF  EMILY MONTAGUE   VOL  IV     THE  HISTORY  OF  EMILY MONTAGUE     By the AUTHOR of  LADY JULIA MANDEVILLE     VOL  IV     L
