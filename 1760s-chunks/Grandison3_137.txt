Lordship  Once you unkindly mentioned the word triumph  The word at the time went to my heart  When I can subdue the natural warmth of my temper  then  and then only  I have a triumph  I should not have remembered this  had I not now  my Lord  on this solemn occasion  been received by you with an indignant eye  I respect your Lordship too m••h not to take notice of this angry reception 〈…〉 silence upon it  perhaps  would look like sub••ribing before this illustrious company to the justice of your contempt  Yet I mean no other notic• than this  and this to demonstrate that I was not in my own opinion at least▪ absolutely unworth▪ of the favour I met with from the father  the mother  the b••thers  you so justly honour  and which I wished to stand in with you   And now  my Lord  allow me the honour of your hand  and as I have given no cause for displeasure  say  that you will remember me with kindness  as I shall honour you and your whole family to the last day of my life   The General heard me out  but it was with great emotion  He accepted not my hand  he returned not any answer  The Bishop arose  and taking him aside  endeavoured to calm him   I addressed myself to the two young Lords  and said  That if ever their curiosity led them to visit England  where I hoped to be in a few months  I should be extremely glad of cultivating their esteem and favour  by the best offices I could do them   They received my civility with politeness     342 I addressed myself next to Lady Laurana—May you madam  the friend  the intimate  the chosen companion of Lady Clementina  never know the hundredth part of the woe that fills the breast of the man before you  for the calamity that has befallen your admirable cousin  and  because of that  a whole excellent family  Let me recommend to you  that tender and soothing treatment to her  which her tender heart would shew to you  in any calamity that should befal you  I am not a bad man  madam  tho  of a different communion from yours  Think but half so charitably of me  as I do of every one of your religion who lives up to his professions  and I shall be happy in your favourable thoughts when you hear me spoken of   It is easy to imagine  Dr  Bartlett  that I addressed myself in this manner to this Lady whom I had never before seen  that she might not think the harder of her cousin s prepossessions in favour of a Protestant   I recommended myself to the favour of Father Marescotti  He assured me of his esteem  in very warm terms   And just as I was again applying to my Jeronymo  the General came to me  You cannot think Sir  said he  nor did you design it  I suppose  that I should be pleased with your address to me  I have only this question to ask  When do you quit Bologna   Let me ask your Lordship said I  When do you return to Naples   Why that question  Sir  haughtily   I will answer you frankly  Your Lordship  at the first of my acquaintance with you  invited me to Napes  I promised to pay my respects to you there  If you think of being there in a week  I will attend you at your own palace in that city  and there  my Lord  I hope  no cause to the contrary having arisen from me  to be received by you with the same kindness and favour that you shewed when you gave me the invitation  I think to leave Bologna to morrow     343 O brother  said the Bishop  Are you not now overcome   And are you in earnest  said the General   I am  my Lord  I have many valuable friends at different courts and cities in Italy  to take leave of  I never intend to see it again  I would look upon your Lordship as one of those friends  But you seem still displeased with me  You accepted not my offered hand before  Once more I tender it  A man of spirit cannot be offended at a man of spirit  without lessening himself  I call upon your dignity  my Lord   He held out his hand  just as I was withdrawing mine  I have pride  you know  Dr  Bartlett  and I was conscious of a superiority in this instance  I took his hand  however  at his offer  yet pitied him  that his motion was made at all  as it wanted that grace which generally accompanies all he does  and says   The Bishop embraced me —Your moderation  thus exerted  said he  must ever make you triumph  O Grandison  you are a Prince of the Almighty s creation   The noble Jeronymo dried his eyes  and held out his arms to embrace me   The General said  I shall certainly be at Naples in a week  I am too much affected by the woes of my family
