from thinking herself honoured by the fleeting passion of the king  she should revolt from his advances with disdain  let not our illustrious sovereign be offended at her reserve  But do you come back hither to morrow  and carry back either the jewels  or a return of affection   I had no doubt but Laura would tutor Lucretia in the school of time serving morality  and depended much on her instruction  It was therefore no small surprise to find that Laura worked as much against wind and tide to launch her daughter into the trade wind of evil  as other maternal pilots to set the sails of theirs in the contrary monsoon of good  and what is still more unaccountable  Lucretia  after tasting of royal delights  was so completely surfeited with the banquet as to throw herself at once into the arms of the church  where she professed  fell sick  and died of grief  Laura  disconsolate for the loss of her daughter  and the part she herself had acted in the tragedy  retired into a convent of female penitents  and did penance for the unhallowed pleasures of her former life  The king was affected by his sudden loss  but soon found comfort in some other pursuit  The premier talked little on the subject  but thought so much the more  as the reader will easily believe       CH  IV     Santillane in a new office   MY feelings were all alive to Lucretia s ill fate  and my own infamy in having contributed to it  The royal wants of the lover were no excuse for my taking the post of cheapener  and I determined to resign the staff of office in that department  entreating the minister to employ me in some other  He was charmed with my nice sense of honour  and promised to comply with my scruples  laying open his inmost heart in the following speech   Some years before I was in office  chance threw me across a lady of such shape and beauty as induced me to trace her home  I learned that she was a Genoese  by name Donna Margarita Spinola  supporting herself at Madrid on the income arising from her beauty  It was reported that Don Francisco de Valéasar  an officer about the court  a rich man  an old man  and a married man  laid out his money very freely on this hazardous speculation  These rumours ought to have deterred me  but they only whetted my desires to share with Valéasar  To gain my end  I had recourse to a female broker of tenderness  who adjusted the terms of a private interview with the Genoese  and the price current being settled  the traffic was frequently repeated  it was an open market for my rival and me  or possibly for many other bidders   Let that be as it may  a choice boy was in the fulness of time produced to the club  and the mother complimented every member individually in private with the credit  but we were each of us too modest to acknowledge a bantling which had so probable a claim upon a better father  so that the Genoese was compelled to maintain him on the profits of her profession  this she did for eighteen years  and dying at the end of that period  has left her son without a farthing  and what is worse  without an idea or an accomplishment   Such  continued his lordship  is the confidence I meant to repose in you  and I shall now lay open the great design I have formed  to draw this unfortunate child from his obscurity  reverse the colour of his fate  raise him to the highest honours  and acknowledge him as my son   At so extravagant a project it was impossible not to be open  mouthed  What  sir  exclaimed I  can your excellency have adopted so strange a resolution  Excuse my freedom  but my zeal cannot restrain itself  You will be of my mind  replied he with eagerness  when I shall have explained to you my motives  I have no mind that my estates should descend in the collateral line  You will tell me  that I am not so old as to despair of having children by Madame d Olivarez  But every one is best judge of his own condition  know therefore that there is not a receipt in the whole extent of chemistry which I have not tried  but without effect  to appear once again in the character of a father  Wherefore  since fortune  stepping in to cover the defects of nature  presents me with a child whose parent after all I may actually be  he is mine by adoption  that is a settled point   When I found the minister determined  I no longer argued against his resolution  as knowing him to be a man who would rather do a foolish act of his own  than adopt a wise suggestion of another  It only remains now  added he  to educate Don Henry Philip de Guzman  for by that name I intend him to be known in the world  till the time arrives when he may aspire to higher dignities  You  my dear Santillane  I have chosen to superintend his conduct  I have full confidence in your talents and friendship  to regulate his household
