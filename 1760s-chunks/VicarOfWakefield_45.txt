me to digest my own happiness at leisure  I saw no more of him  till told by a footman that his lordship was going to his coach at the door  Down I immediately followed  and joined my voice to that of three or four more  who came  like me  to petition for favours  His lordship  however  went too fast for us  and was gaining his Chariot door with large strides  when I hallowed out to know if I was to have any reply  He was by this time got in  and muttered an answer  half of which only I heard  the other half was lost in the rattling of his chariot wheels  I stood for some time with my neck  Page  18  stretched out  in the posture of one that was listening to catch the glorious sounds  till looking round me  I found myself alone at his lordship s gate      My patience    continued my son    was now quite exhausted  stung with the thousand indignities I had met with  I was willing to cast myself away  and only wanted the gulph to receive me  I regarded myself as one of those vile things that nature designed should be thrown by into her lumber room  there to perish in unpitied obscurity  I had still  however  half a guinea left  and of that I thought fortune herself should not deprive me  but in order to be sure of this  I was resolved to go instantly and spend it while I had it  and then trust to occurrences for the rest  As I was going along with this resolution  it happened that Mr  Cripse s office seemed invitingly open to give me a welcome reception  In this office Mr  Cripse kindly offers all his  Page  19  majesty s subjects a generous promise of 30 l  a year  for which promise all they give in return is their liberty for life  and permission to let him transport them to America as slaves  I was happy at finding a place where I could lose my fears in desperation  and therefore entered this cell  for it had the appearance of one  being dark  damp  and dirty  Here I found a number of poor creatures  all in circumstances like myself  expecting the arrival of Mr  Cripse  presenting a true epitome of English impatience  Each untractable soul at variance with fortune  wreaked her injuries on their own hearts  but Mr  Cripse at last came down  and all our murmurs were hushed  He deigned to regard me with an air of peculiar approbation  and indeed he was the first man who for a month past talked to me with smiles  After a few questions  he found I was fit for every thing in the world  He paused a while upon the properest means of providing for me   Page  20  and slapping his forehead  as if he had found it  assured me  that there was at that time an embassy talked of from the synod of Pensylvania to the Chickasaw Indians  and that he would use his interest to get me made secretary  I knew in my own heart that the fellow lied  and yet his promise gave me pleasure  there was something so magnisicent in the sound  I fairly  therefore  divided my half guinea  one half of which went to be added to his thirty thousand pound  and with the other half I resolved to go to the next tavern  to be there more happy than he    As I was going out with that resolution  I was met at the door by the captain of a ship  with whom I had formerly some little acquaintance  and he agreed to be my companion over a bowl of punch  As I never chose to make a secret of my circumstances  he assured me that I was upon the very point of ruin  in listening  Page  21  to the office keeper s promises  for that he only designed to sell me to the plantations  But  continued he  I fancy you might  by a much shorter voyage  be very easily put into a genteel way of bread  Take my advice  My ship sails to morrow for Amsterdam  What if you go in her as a passenger  The moment you land all you have to do is to teach the Dutchmen English  and I ll warrant you ll get pupils and money enough  I suppose you understand English  added he  by this time  or the deuce is in it  I confidently assured him of that  but expressed a doubt whether the Dutch would be willing to learn English  He affirmed with an oath that they were fond of it to distraction  and upon that affirmation I agreed with his proposal  and embarked the next day to teach the Dutch English in Holland  The wind was fair  our voyage short  and after having paid my passage with half my moveables  I found myself  fallen as if from the skies  a  Page  22  stranger in one of the principal streets of Amsterdam  In this situation I was unwilling to let any time pass unemployed in teaching  I addressed myself therefore to two or three of those I met
