sufficient reason to judge that   his conduct would be entirely ruled by it  and his talents exerted   in the more pleasing and extensive way of recommending it to   imitation  by displaying all its advantages and charms  as soon  as   time should cool the fervour of his passions  and apply its lenient   balsam to the sores in his heart  the smart of which first gave him   that poignant turn  and drove him for relief to excesses that too   often drowned his better reason  and led him into actions which    in a cooler moment  he abhorred  In a word  his failings were the   luxuriance of nature  as his virtues were her perfection  As I have   said that he turned his poetical vein particularly to satire  I see   your curiosity to know my opinion of the propriety and benefit of   that manner of applying the powers of wit  But I have often told   you that I am not permitted to determine controverted points    Many  with a plausible appearance of good nature  decry it  as   proceeding from a malevolence of disposition  and tending only   to spread the influence of bad example  by making it known  and   harden people in vices they might forsake if not made desperate   by detection  Many  with an appearance of virtuous indignation    vindicate it  as terrifying from vice  by showing it in its native defor    mity and correctiug folly  by putting it out of countenance  which   latter opinion is supported by the authority of one of the most   sensible and best men of his age    But still the indulgence of this     1 Would the anachronism admit the Bupposition  the editor would   imagine that the author here meant the writer of Letters from a Persian   in England  etc   whose words are these     If all the edge of wit is turned   on those who are justly the objects of ridicule  wit is as great a benefit   to private life  as the sword ol the magistrate is to public    â€” Letter xl          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 476     turn is attended with many iaconvenienoes and dangers  if it bo   not guided with the greatest care  That imaginary superiority    which the power of making another ridiculous or detested flatters a   man with  is so pleasing to the self love inseparable from human   nature  that it requires uncommon moderation to refrain from   exercising it upon improper occasions  and makes him presumptuously   conclude  that whatever happens to displease himself in any par    ticular ia a just object of public ridicule and censure â€” an error   into which the impetuosity of my late master sometimes hurried him      I have given you a sketch of the character of my new master   upon a former occasion  to which I have only to add here  that   a wanton abuse of uncommon abilities inverted the end for which   they were given  making them disgraceful to himself and danger    ous to his country  a licentious pursuit of everything called pleasure   having wasted his fortune  and driven him to the despicable necessity   of prostituting them to any purpose that  might promise to retrieve   his affairs  The gentleman whom he went to wait upon the morning   I came into his possession i  was one who had served his king and   country with fidelity and success  while he was permitted to follow   the dictates of his own reason in their service  but gave up the   empty and disgraceful appearance of acting in it any longer  on   finding his judgment disregarded and himself designed to be made   only a cypher  to increase the consequence of another  The in    dignation  however  which had prompted him to take this step    led him not into those unjustifiable lengths which are too common   on such occasions  He was faithful to his sovereign  though he had   lost his favour  and watched attentively over the interests of hia   country  though he was not permitted to promote them  The only   instance in which his conduct could possibly be censured waslus   patronising such a man as my master  But it is a maxim in human   politics that the end justifies the means  be they what they will    He wanted to be restored to his former power  and thought this   man s exposing the insufficiency of those who had supplanted him   in it  the most likely way to effect that purpose  To this desire   of power he was not stimulated by the usual methods of repairing   a ruined fortune or making a new family  His wealth exceeded   his very wishes  and he already enjoyed the highest honours he   could aspire to  AU he proposed was the glory of his sovereign   and
