unfortunately mentioned a pine apple   part of which he had eaten a week before at the house of a nobleman  who  lived in another part of the country  at the distance of a hundred miles  at least   The name of this fatal fruit was no sooner pronounced  than Mrs   Grizzle  who incessantly watched her sister s looks  took the alarm   because she thought they gave certain indications of curiosity and  desire  and after having observed that she herself could never eat  pine apples  which were altogether unnatural productions  extorted  by the force of artificial fire out of filthy manure  asked  with a  faltering voice  if Mrs  Pickle was not of her way of thinking  This  young lady  who wanted neither slyness nor penetration  at once divined  her meaning  and replied  with seeming unconcern  that for her own part  she should never repine if there was no pine apple in the universe   provided she could indulge herself with the fruits of her own country   This answer was calculated for the benefit of the stranger  who would  certainly have suffered for his imprudence by the resentment of Mrs   Grizzle  had her sister expressed the least relish for the fruit in  question  It had the desired effect  and re established the peace of the  company  which was not a little endangered by the gentleman s want of  consideration  Next morning  however  after breakfast  the pregnant  lady  in pursuance of her plan  yawned  as it were by accident  full in  the face of her maiden sister  who being infinitely disturbed by this  convulsion  affirmed it was a symptom of longing  and insisted upon  knowing the object in desire  when Mrs  Pickle affecting a smile  told her she had eaten a most delicious pine apple in her sleep  This  declaration was attended with an immediate scream  uttered by  Mrs  Grizzle  who instantly perceiving her sister surprised at the  exclamation  clasped her in her arms  and assured her  with a sort of  hysterical laugh  that she could not help screaming with joy  because  she had it in her power to gratify her dear sister s wish  a lady in  the neighbourhood having promised to send her  as a present  a couple of  delicate pine apples  which she would on that very day go in quest of   Mrs  Pickle would by no means consent to this proposal  on pretence of  sparing the other unnecessary fatigue  and assured her  that if she had  any desire to eat a pine apple  it was so faint  that the disappointment  could produce no bad consequence  But this assurance was conveyed in  a manner  which she knew very well how to adopt  that  instead of  dissuading  rather stimulated Mrs  Grizzle to set out immediately  not  on a visit to that lady  whose promise she herself had feigned with  a view of consulting her sister s tranquility  but on a random Search  through the whole country for this unlucky fruit  which was like to  produce so much vexation and prejudice to her and her father s house     6 22 15  3 45 PM   During three whole days and nights did she  attended by a valet  ride  from place to place without success  unmindful of her health  and  careless of her reputation  that began to suffer from the nature of her  inquiry  which was pursued with such peculiar eagerness and distraction   that everybody with whom she conversed  looked upon her as an unhappy  person  whose intellects were not a little disordered   Baffled in all her researches within the country  she at length decided  to visit that very nobleman at whose house the officious stranger had  been  for her  so unfortunately regaled  and actually arrived  in a  post chaise  at the place of his habitation  when she introduced her  business as an affair on which the happiness of a whole family depended   By virtue of a present to his lordship s gardener  she procured the  Hesperian fruit  with which she returned in triumph   CHAPTER VI    Mrs  Grizzle is indefatigable in gratifying her Sister s  Longings  Peregrine is born  and managed contrary to the Directions  and Remonstrances of his Aunt  who is disgusted upon that account  and  resumes the Plan which she had before rejected   The success of this device would have encouraged Mrs  Pickle to practise  more of the same sort upon her sister in law  had she not been deterred  by a violent fever which seized her zealous ally  in consequence of the  fatigue and uneasiness she had undergone  which  while it lasted  as  effectually conduced to her repose  as any other stratagem she could  invent  But Mrs  Grizzle s health was no sooner restored  than the  other  being as much incommoded as ever  was obliged  in her own  defence  to have recourse to some other contrivance  and managed her  artifices in such a manner  as leaves it at this day
