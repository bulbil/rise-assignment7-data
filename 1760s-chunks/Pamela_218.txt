 that I dressed myself in a rich white satin   night gown  that had been my good lady s  and my best head clothes  etc    I have got such a knack of writing  that when I am by myself  I cannot   sit without a pen in my hand   But I am now called to breakfast  I   suppose the gentlemen are come   Now  courage  Pamela  Remember thou   art upon thy good behaviour   Fie upon it  my heart begins to flutter   again   Foolish heart  be still  Never  sure  was any maiden s perverse   heart under so little command as mine   It gave itself away  at first    without my leave  it has been  for weeks  pressing me with its wishes    and yet now  when it should be happy itself  and make me so  it is   throb  throb  throb  like a little fool  and filling me with such   unseasonable misgivings  as abate the rising comforts of all my better   prospects          Thursday  near three o clock       I thought I should have found no time nor heart to write again this day    But here are three gentlemen come  unexpectedly  to dine with my master    and so I shall not appear  He has done all he could  civilly  to send   them away  but they will stay  though I believe he had rather they would   not  And so I have nothing to do but to write till I go to dinner myself   with Mrs  Jewkes  for my master was not prepared for this company  and   it will be a little latish to day  So I will begin with my happy story   where I left off       When I came down to breakfast  Mr  Peters and Mr  Williams were both   there  And as soon as my master heard me coming down  he met me at the   door  and led me in with great tenderness  He had kindly spoken to them    as he told me afterwards  to mention no more of the matter to me  than   needs must  I paid my respects to them  I believe a little awkwardly    and was almost out of breath  but said  I had come down a little too   fast       When Abraham came in to wait  my master said   that the servants should   not mistrust    Tis well  gentlemen  you came as you did  for my good   girl and I were going to take an airing till dinner time  I hope you ll   stay and dine with me  Sir  said Mr  Peters  we won t hinder your   airing  I only came  having a little time upon my hands  to see your   chapel  but must be at home at dinner  and Mr  Williams will dine with   me  Well then  said my master  we will pursue our intention  and ride   out for an hour or two  as soon as I have shewn Mr  Peters my little   chapel  Will you  Pamela  after breakfast  walk with us to it  If    if  said I  and had like to have stammered  foolish that I was  if you   please  sir  I could look none of them in the face  Abraham looking at   me  Why  child  said my master  you have hardly recovered your fright   yet  how came your foot to slip   Tis well you did not hurt yourself    Said Mr  Peters  improving the hint  You ha n t sprained your ancle    madam  I hope  No  sir  said I  I believe not  but  tis a little painful   to me  And so it was  for I meant my foolishness  Abraham  said my   master  bid Robin put the horses to the coach  instead of the chariot    and if these gentlemen will go  we can set them down  No matter  sir    said Mr  Peters  I had as lieve walk  if Mr  Williams chooses it  Well   then  said my master  let it be the chariot  as I told him       I could eat nothing  though I attempted it  and my hand shook so  I   spilled some of my chocolate  and so put it down again  and they were   all very good  and looked another way  My master said  when Abraham was   out  I have a quite plain ring here  Mr  Peters  And I hope the ceremony   will dignify the ring  and that I shall give my girl reason to think   it  for that cause  the most valuable one
