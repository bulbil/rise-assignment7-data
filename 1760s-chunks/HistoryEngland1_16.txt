of the power of working miracles  Crucifixes  altars  and even horses  were heard to harangue in defence of the Monks  and inveigh against the Secular clergy  but particularly Dunstan the Monk had no small power over the hosts of heaven  his illuminations were frequent  his temptations strong  but he always resisted with bravery  The Devil  say the Monks  and that seriously too  once tempted him in the shape of a fine woman  but he soon sent him off  by catching him by the nose  and leading him about for public derision  Such stories were then propagated  and  what is still more extraordinary  were believed  I am the more surprised at the credulity of the times  as the people certainly were not destitute of classical learning  and some skill   46 in the polite arts  We have a Latin speech or two still preserved  which were spoken by their Monarchs at that period  replete with elegance  perspicuity  and good sense   However that may be  the Monks  by the assistance of miracles  prevailed  Edwy was dethroned  and his brother Edgar placed in his room  Historians represent England  under this reign  as completely happy  and  it is certain  the kingdom still seemed to enjoy the fruits of Alfred s wisdom  for  of all the obscure ages  from the entire decadence of taste  till its revival in the fifteenth century  this might be termed the Augustan  The English fleets are described as amounting to above four thousand ships  Kings came to Edgar s court  and returned without molestation or fear  Music  painting  and poetry  were then held as necessary accomplishments to a refined education  as they are now  But his gallantries are peculiarly the subject of the historians of that time  and are still the theme of romance  He is said  first  to have debauched a nun  then to have attempted the chastity of a nobleman s daughter  but the amour  which is famous to this day  is his adventure with the beautiful Elfrida   Edgar had long heard of the beauty of a young lady  whose name was Elfrida  daughter to the Earl of Devonshire  however  not willing to credit fame in this particular he sent Ethelwolfe  his favourite  to see if Elfrida was indeed that incomparable woman report had spoken her  Ethelwolfe had no sooner arrived at the Earl of Devonshire s  and cast his eyes upon that nobleman s beautiful daughter  but he became desperately enamoured of her himself  such was the violence of his passion  that  forgetting his master  he demanded   47 the beautiful Elfrida for his own wife  His request was granted  the favourite of a King was not likely to find a refusal  and they were married in private  Returning soon after to court  he assured the King  that Elfrida was much inferior to the representations that had been made of her  and he was amazed how the world could talk so much of her charms  The King was satisfied  and no longer felt any curiosity  Ethelwolfe  therefore  after some time  perceiving the King perfectly indifferent with regard to the lady  represented to his Majesty  one day  that  though the fortune of the Earl of Devonshire s daughter would be a trifle to a Monarch  yet it would be an immense sum to a needy subject  and  therefore  he humbly prayed leave to pay his addresses to her  as being the greatest heiress in the kingdom  A request  so seemingly reasonable  was readily complied with  Ethelwolfe returned to his wife  and their nuptials were solemnized in public  He had the precaution  however  of not permitting her to appear at court  before a King so susceptible of love  and she so capable of inspiring passion  Notwithstanding all these precautions  it was impossible to keep his treachery long concealed  Favourites are never without private enemies  who desire an opportunity of rising upon their ruin  Edgar was informed of all  but  dissembling his resentment  he took an occasion to visit that part of the country where this miracle of beauty was detained  Accompanied by his favourite  when he was near the place  he told him  he had a curiosity to see his wife  of whom he had formerly heard so much  Ethelwolfe  thunderstruck at the proposal  did all in his power  but in vain  to dissuade him  all he could obtain was leave to go before  on pretence   48 of preparing her for the King s reception  On his arrival  he fell at his wife s fee  confessing what he had done to be possessed of her charms  conjured her to conceal  as much as possible  her beauty from the King  who was but too susceptible of passion  Elfrida promised compliance  but  prompted either by vanity  or revenge  she adorned her person with the most exquisite art  and called up all her beauty upon this occasion  The event answered her expectations  the King no sooner saw  but he loved her  and was instantly resolved to obtain her  The better to effect his design  he concealed his sensations from the husband  and took his leave with a seeming indifference  Soon
