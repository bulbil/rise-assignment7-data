unfrequented by the inhabitants of the Continent  In this seclusion  blest with all that wild uncultivated nature could bestow  lived a princess and her two daughters  She had been wrecked upon the coast while her children as yet were infants  who of consequence  though grown up  were entirely unacquainted with man  Yet  unexperienced as the young ladies were in the opposite sex  both early discovered symptoms  the one of prudery  the other of being a coquet  The eldest was ever learning maxims of wisdom and discretion from her mamma  while the youngest employed all her hours in gazing at her own face in a neighbouring fountain   Their usual amusement in this solitude was fishing  Their mother had taught them all the secrets of the art  she shewed them which were the most likely places to throw out the line  what baits were most proper for the various seasons  and the best manner to draw up the finny prey  when they had hooked it  In this manner they spent their time  easy and innocent  till one day  the Princess being indisposed  desired them to go and catch her a sturgeon or a shark for supper  which she fancied might sit easy on her stomach  The daughters obeyed  and clapping on a gold fish  the usual bait  on those occasions  went and sat upon one of the rocks  letting the gilded hook glide down with the stream     100On the opposite shore  farther down  at the mouth of the river  lived a diver for pearls  a youth  who  by long habit in his trade  was almost grown amphibious  so that he could remain whole hours at the bottom of the water  without ever fetching breath  He happened to be at that very instant diving when the ladies were fishing with the gilded hook  Seeing therefore the bait  which to him had the appearance of real gold  he was resolved to seize the prize  but both his hands being already filled with pearl oysters  he found himself obliged to snap at it with his mouth  The consequence is easily imagined  the hook  before unperceived  was instantly fastened in his jaw  nor could he  with all his efforts  or his floundering  get free    Sister  cries the youngest Princess  I have certainly caught a monstrous fish  I never perceived any thing struggle so at the end of my line before  come  and help me to draw it in   They both now therefore assisted in fishing up the Diver on shore  but nothing could equal their surprize upon seeing him   Bless my eyes  cries the prude  what have we got here  this is a very odd fish to be sure  I never saw any thing in my life look so queer  what eyes  what terrible claws  what a monstrous snout  I have read of this monster somewhere before  it certainly must be a Tanlang that eats women  let us throw it back into the sea where we found it   The Diver in the mean time stood upon the beach  at the end of the line  with the hook in his mouth  using every art that he thought could best excite pity  and particularly looking extremely tender  which is usual in such circumstances  The   101 coquet therefore  in some measure influenced by the innocence of his looks  ventured to contradict her companion   Upon my word  sister  says she  I see nothing in the animal so very terrible as you are pleased to apprehend  I think it may serve well enough for a change  Always sharks  and sturgeons  and lobsters  and crawfish  make me quite sick  I fancy a slice of this nicely grilladed  and dressed up with shrimp sauce  would be very pretty eating  I fancy mamma would like a bit with pickles above all things in the world  and if it should not sit easy on her stomach  it will be time enough to discontinue it when found disagreeable  you know    Horrid  cries the prude  would the girl be poisoned  I tell you it is a Tanlang  I have read of it in twenty places  It is every where described as the most pernicious animal that ever infested the ocean  I am certain it is the most insidious  ravenous creature in the world  and is certain destruction if taken internally   The youngest sister was now therefore obliged to submit  both assisted in drawing the hook with some violence from the Diver s jaw  and he finding himself at liberty  bent his breast against the broad wave and disappeared in an instant   Just at this juncture the mother came down to the beach  to know the cause of her daughter s delay  they told her every circumstance  describing the monster they had caught  The old lady was one of the most discreet women in the world  she was called the black eyed Princess  from two black eyes she had received in her youth  being a little addicted to boxing in her liquor   Alas  my children  cries she  what have you done  the fish you caught was a man fish  one of the most   102 tame domestic animals in the world  We could have
