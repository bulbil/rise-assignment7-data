himself  as he actually did in a great measure  tiU most of his   little party was out off  as it was a thousand to one but they all   must  unsupported as they were  though it appeared after  that if   a proper force had been posted in that very place at first  or he   reinforced in any time  the heavy loss and disgrace suffered on that   occasion might have been prevented  But still that was reckoned   no business of his  and therefore all the reward he got for his pains   was to have two officers  who were not even in the action  put over   his head  and the company s money  which he had lost along with   all his own baggage  refused to be made good to him  because he   was a volunteer on that attack  For  sorry I am to say it  that is   not the way to rise in the army nowadays  Where a man has not   interest to push him forward  being able to sing a good song  or   pimp well  or having a handsome wife or sister  with a proper degree   of humility and complaisance  will avail him more than all the   courage and conduct in romance  In my patron s   time  indeed    things were not so  Brave himself  he expected that every man   under him should be brave also  nor would let any recommendation   compensate for the want of merit in those who sought his favour    as his own interest and honour were naturally and inseparably con    nected with those of his country   and he was not lifted up to power    only to be the tool of a party  nor obliged to support himself in it   by intrigue  without any other view or motive than that of amassing   its emoluments   and therefore it has been the great misfortune of   this officer that he never served immediately under him         The king s uncle  the Duke of Cumberland  victor of CuUoden    He was less unpopular now than he had been for many years  his oppo    isition to Bute winning him the good graces oÂ£ the public          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 303         CHAPTER XL VI     chbysal s master makes some remaeks on certain matters â€”   the method which the general took to parry the officer     â€” CHEYSAL s MASTER MAKES UP THE AFFAIR â€” THE GENERAL GIVES   THE OFFICER AN 0PP0RTT7NITY OF DISTINGUISHING HIMSELF    WHICH HE DOES IN A SIGNAL MANNER     It is remarked that men seldom inquire into the causes of things   continually before their eyes  Habitual acquaintance prevents   that curiosity  which is one of the strongest incentives to knowledge    They have always seen such things  and therefore have never   inquired how they came to be so      My master  who had long observed the fact  but never thought of   the cause  was struck with what his friend said  After some pause   â€”   I am afraid what you say is too true    said he    and cannot help   attributing it to a cause  not much to the credit of the commanders    who certainly would never discourage merit in others  were they not   conscious they had not risen by it themselves  and therefore look   upon it with an envious eye  as a reproach to them  Indeed  it   can scarcely be expected that a general  who has spent his life in   paying court to a minister or favourite  or who was preferred only   for his interest in parliament  should act otherwise  But what will   you do with this officer   It will have an odd look if you don t   see him   at the same time  if he should propose anything of real   consequence  I am absolutely at a loss how to advise you to act          The only method I can think of  is this   his temper is warm    and his notions of honour punctiliously high  I will  therefore    receive him with a distance that I know will hurt his sensibility    and provoke him to say something  of which I may take advantage   to break off the conference  without entering into the subject of   his coming   for he speaks as boldly as he acts  and thinks it beneath   him to soften his sentiments by any qualifying expression        Accordingly  the general ordered the officer to be admitted  and   asking him slightly what was his business â€”       I come  sir    answered he    to inform you that I have discovered   a proper place
