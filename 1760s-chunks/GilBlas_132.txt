in the morning  The ceremonies of the day began with reciprocal embraces  about which it was impossible for Aurora to be squeamish  for then Don Felix must have dropped the mask altogether  They went out and walked about town arm in arm  attended by Chilindron  Don Lewis s footman  and myself  We loitered about the gates of the university  looking at some posting bills and advertisements of new publications  There were a good many people amusing themselves  like us  with reading over the contents of these placards  Among the rest my eye was caught by a little fellow  who was giving his opinion very learnedly on the works exposed to sale  I observed him to be heard with profound attention  and could not help remarking how amply he deserved it in his own opinion  He was evidently a complete coxcomb  of an arrogant and dictatorial stamp  the common curse of your gentry under size  This new translation of Horace  said he  announced here to the public in letters of a yard long  is a prose work  executed by an old college author  The students have taken a great fancy to the book  so as to carry off four editions  But not a copy has been bought by any man of taste  His criticisms were scarcely more candid on any of the other books  he mauled them every one without mercy  It was easy enough to see he was an author  I should not have been sorry to have staid out his harangue  but Don Lewis and Don Felix were not to be left in the lurch  Now they took as little pleasure in this gentleman s remarks as they felt interest in the books which he was Scaligerising  so that they took a quiet leave of him and the university   We returned home at dinner time  My mistress sat down at table with Pacheco  and dexterously turned the conversation on her private concerns  My father  said she  is a younger branch of the Mendoza family  settled at Toledo  and my mother is own sister to Donna Kimena de Guzman  who came to Salamanca some days ago on an affair of business  with her niece Aurora  only daughter of Don Vincent de Guzman  whom possibly you might be acquainted with  No  answered Don Lewis  but I have often heard of him  as well as of your cousin Aurora  Is it true what they say of her  Her wit and beauty are reported to be unrivalled  As for wit  replied Don Felix  she certainly is not wanting  for she has taken great pains to cultivate her mind  But her beauty is by no means to be boasted of  indeed  we are thought to be very much alike  If that is the case  exclaimed Pacheco  she cannot be behindhand with her reputation  Your features are regular  your complexion almost too fine for a man  your cousin must be an absolute enchantress  I should like to see and converse with her  That you shall  if I have any interest in the family  and this very day too  replied the little Proteus of a Mendoza  We will go and see my aunt after dinner   My mistress took the first opportunity of changing the topic  and conversing on indifferent subjects  In the afternoon  while the two friends were getting ready to go and call on Donna Kimena  I played the scout  and ran before to prepare the duenna for her visitors  But there was no time to be lost on my return  for Don Felix was waiting for me to attend Don Lewis and him on their way to his aunt s  No sooner had they stepped over the threshold than they were encountered by the adroit old lady  making signs to them to walk as softly as possible  Hush  hush  said she  in a low voice  you will waken my niece  Ever since yesterday she has had a dreadful headache  but is just now a little better  and the poor girl has been taking a little sleep for the last quarter of an hour  I am sorry for this unlucky accident  said Mendoza  I was in hopes we should have seen my cousin  Besides  I meant to have introduced my friend Pacheco  There is no such great hurry on that account  answered Ortiz with a significant smile  and if that is all  you may defer it till to morrow  The gentlemen did not trouble the old lady with a long visit  but took their leave as soon as they decently could   Don Lewis took us to see a young gentleman of his acquaintance  by name Don Gabriel de Pedros  There we stayed the remainder of the day  and took our suppers  About two o clock in the morning we sallied forth on our return home  We had got about half way  when we stumbled against something on the ground  and discovered two men stretched at their length in the street  We concluded they had fallen under the knife of the assassin  and stopped to assist them  if yet within reach of assistance  As we were looking about to inform ourselves of their condition  as nearly as the darkness of the night would allow  the patrole came up  The officer took us at first for the murderers
