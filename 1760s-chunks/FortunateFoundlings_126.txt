your father    transported to find my long lost child  whom I myself knew not was so   till I believed her gone for ever   a thousand times I have wished both   you and Horatio were my children  but little suspected you were so  till   after his too eager ambition deprived me of him  and my mistaken love   drove you to seek a refuge among strangers       Tears of joy and tenderness now bedewed the faces of both father and   daughter   silence for some moments succeeded the late acclamations  but   Dorilaus at length finding her fully convinced she was as happy as he   said she was  and entirely freed from all those apprehensions which had   occasioned her flying from him  told her he was settled in Paris  that   he lived just opposite to the house where she had stood up on account of   the shower  and happening to be at one of his windows immediately knew   her  that he sent a servant after her  who had enquired how long she had   been arrived  and in what manner she came  that he had sent for her with   no other intent then to make trial how she would resent it  and was   transported to find her answer such as he hoped and had expected from   her   he added  that he had all the anxiety of a father to hear by what   means she had been supported  and the motive which induced her to travel   in the habit of a pilgrim  as the matter of the hotel had informed his   servant  but that he would defer his satisfaction till she should be in   a place more becoming his daughter       On concluding these words he called for the master of the hotel  and   having defrayed what little expences she had been at since her coming   there  took her by the hand and led her to his chariot  which soon   brought them to a magnificent  house  and furnished in a manner   answerable to the birth and fortune of the owner       Louisa had all this time seemed like one in a dream   she had ever loved   Dorilaus with a filial affection  and to find herself really his   daughter  to be snatched at once from all those cares which attend   penury  when accompanied with virtue  and an abhorrence of entering into   measures inconsistent with the strictest honour  to be relieved from   every want  and in a station which commanded respect and homage  was   such a surcharge of felicity  that she was less able to support than all   the fatigues she had gone thro   Surprize and joy made her appear more   dull and stupid than she had ever been in her whole life before  and   Dorilaus was obliged to repeat all he had said over and over again  to   bring her into her usual composedness  and enable her to give him the   satisfaction he required       But as soon as she had  by degrees  recollected herself  she modestly   related all that had happened to her from the time she left him   the   methods by which she endeavoured to earn her bread   the insults she was   exposed to at mrs  C  l  ge s   the way she came acquainted with   Melanthe   the kindness shown her by that lady   their travels   together   the base stratagem made use of by count de Bellfleur to ruin   her with that lady  the honourable position monsieur du Plessis had   professed for her   the seasonable assistance he had given her  in that   iminent danger she was in from the count s unlawful designs upon   her   his placing her afterwards in the monastry   the treachery of the   abbess   the artifice she had been obliged to make use of to get out of   the nunnery   her pilgrimage   in fine  concealed no part of her   adventures  only that which related to the passion she had for du   Plessis  which she endeavoured  as much as she could  to disguise  under   the names of gratitude for the obligations he had conferred upon her    and admiration of his virtue  so different from what she had found in   others who had addressed her       Dorilaus  however  easily perceived the tenderness with which she was   agitated on the account of that young gentleman  but he would not excite   her blushes by taking any notice of it  especially as he found nothing   to condemn in it  and had observed  throughout the course of her whole   narrative  she had behaved on other occasions with a discretion far   above her years  he was far from wronging her  by suspecting she had   swerved from it in this       But
