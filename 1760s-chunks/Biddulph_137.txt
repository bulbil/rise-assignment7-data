a very little  will content me for the rest of my days  My master embraced her  and the sweet children  and said  if heaven spared him life  he would yet be the happiest man in the world  Many a time have I been witness to such discourse between them  for they knew my love for them was so great  that they would never scruple talking of their affairs before me  Oh  madam  I believe there was never a truer penitent than my master  My dear lady has said to me  since they were forced to sell her jointure  Patty  though we are now reduced to little more than two hundred pounds a year  I have much more comfort than when we had twelve  I have the satisfaction of seeing Mr Arnold such as I wish him  he is an altered man  Patty  he is truly virtuous  and I am sure he loves me now from right reason  I am content with the little that is left us   I always prayed for her prosperity  but  madam  God is pleased to order things otherwise than we poor silly mortalls think the best  My lady has always been good and pious  and I hope he will yet bring her out of her troubles  tho’ they are great and many   My lady always charged me to be minute  and to write particulars  but  good madam  excuse the silly way I put my words together  I have not yet come to the dismal part of my story  and I hardly know how to go on  for indeed I am forced to break off every now and then to cry  Reason enough I have  to be sure  but what is my sorrow compared to my lady’s   The day before yesterday my master was asked by some gentlemen in our neighbourhood to go a hunting  he had no mind to go  for my lady was not very well  and he was unwilling to leave her  but she persuaded him  because she knew he loved hunting dearly  she has blamed herself for it ever since  but she could not know by enchantment what was to happen  He left my lady in bed  and went out about five o’clock in the morning  At eight  as my lady was sitting at breakfast  and I attending  the other maid called me out  Our man  who had gone abroad with my master  was in the kitchen  and looked as pale as death  I asked him what was the matter  The poor fellow could hardly speak  but at last said  my master has got a desperate fall in leaping a ditch  and I am afraid has hurt his skull  he is lying at farmer Hill’s cottage  and one of the gentleman is rid off for a surgeon  but that is no place for him  we must get him home  but I thought it best to prepare my lady before she sees him  My lady rung    her bell before I could answer him  I ran in  but I am sure I looked like a ghost  for my lady started when she saw me  Bless me  Patty  said she  what is the matter  Has any thing happened to your master  Not much Madam  said I  He is killed she cried  and sprung out of her chair  Indeed he is not  Madam  I answered  standing between her and the door  but he has got a fall  and is a little hurt  She made me no answer  but flew down stairs  out at the front door  and down the avenue as quick as an arrow  I ran after her  and the other servants after me  we could not overtake her  but she was soon stopped  for she met my poor master borne by four men  I suppose she thought he was dead  for she fainted away directly  and we carried her in after him   My master was put to bed  he was alive  but not able to speak  He had got a dreadful cut in his head  and was sadly bruised besides   As soon as my lady came to herself  we told her my master was not killed  She went into his room  but had not power to speak  but sat like a stone statue at his bed side  The surgeon came in less than half an hour  I believe he is but a sorry one  for after he had dressed the wound  he said there was no danger in it  At first we were all in hopes that it was so  for about two o’clock my master got his speech again  he complained of sickness at his stomach  and violent pains all over him   My lady  on hearing him speak  seemed to be rouzed as if out of a deep sleep  Several of the gentlemen  who had been out with my master  had come to enquire how he did  and though some of them came into his chamber  my mistress did not speak  nor seem to regard any of them  The first word she uttered was to call me  Patty  said she  what is the reason I do not see Mr Main here  It was
