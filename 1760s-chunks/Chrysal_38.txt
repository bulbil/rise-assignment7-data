 began thus   â€”       I believe that God made the world  and all things in it  for my   lords the Jesuits   and that I must worship Him by obejdng them    and saying the prayers they direct me to the saints  and the Blessed   Virgin  the Mother of God   and above all  to the great saint Ignatius   Loyola  But if I disobey their commands in anything  or repine   at their service  or think that I must obey the viceroy before them    I shall be burned to death in the Inquisition here  and the great   devil will burn me for ever after I am dead          Well  son  remember  and practise thy creed  and thy sins shall   be forgiven thee  Go  and bring the boy when it is dark            CHAPTER VIII     THE HOLY FATHEK s TENDEBNESS TO ANOTHBB PENITENT  WHO HAD   RAVISHED  MtTBDBKED  AND BOBBED HIS OWN BBOTHEE s WITE â€”   HE ACCEPTS THE SPOIL AS A BECOMPENSB TO THE CHTJBCH â€” HE   HINTS A METHOD OF PEEVBNTING THE DANGER OF HIS BEOTHEB S   RESENTMENT  AND DISMISSES HIM WITH GHOSTLY ADVICE     The severity with which the Jesuit required satisfaction for the   imaginary faults of the poor Peruvian may  perhaps  lead you to   think that his zeal would be inexorable to real crimes   but the   following account will show you that it was no such thing  and that   he looked upon nothing as a crime which was not detrimental to   the power or temporal interest of his Society      The next penitent who approached the mercy seat was a com    mander in the army  He advanced with a military intrepidity  and   kneeling down in form     Father    said he    I have a long reckoning   to make  and some of the articles are rather heavy          My son    replied the priest    you have had experience of the   indulgence of the Church  and that no crimes are too black for her         22 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     mercy  on proper penitence  Proceed  then  and open your ailments   to your physician  nor fear the ef cacy of his medicines          You know then  father    said the penitent    that I have long   burned with a passion for the wife of my brother  the judge  It   was the subject of my last confession          I remember it right well    replied the father    and you may   remember also what ghostly  yet comfortable  advice I gave you    to strive against and suppress it if you could          True  father   but I told you then that I knew it would be in   vain for me to strive  as I was resolved to ejijoy her  though at the   hazard of life             But  son  did I not comfort you by saying that if you found it   in vain to strive  and could not live without her  as life was the   greatest good in this world  it was just that you should preserve   yours by obtaining what you were so violently set upon   but always   be careful that you conduct matters so as not to give offence by   your success          Ah  but  father  that was not in my power   she was deaf to all   my entreaties   and that threw me into such despair that  not able   to wait any longer  I have this very morning had recourse to force          That was really bad  if it could have been avoided   but as you   would not have forced her if she would have complied willingly    that alters the case very much in your favour   and perhaps she   put you to that trouble only to save the appearance of her own   virtue   and if so  you have both acted right  and there is no harm   done  provided the affair is not disclosed          Oh  father  that is the thing  I was afraid of that   and as her   husband had always been a father to me  and all my future hopes   depended on him  I so greatly dreaded her telling him that  to   prevent it  as soon as I had enjoyed her  I cut her throat          Murder
