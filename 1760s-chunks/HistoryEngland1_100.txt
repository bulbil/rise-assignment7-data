passion to obey  her resentment  at last  prevailed  he was executed six days after his sentence  and died with penitence and resolution   Thus ended a favourite who had merits  but did not owe his rise to them  he was gallant  romantic  and ostentatious  his genius for shews  and those pleasures that carry an image of war  was as remarkable as his spirit in the profession itself  and  had he been possessed of humility equal to his abilities  he at last might have mounted a throne instead of a scaffold  The Queen  at first  carried her resentment so far as to have a sermon preached at St  Paul s cross to blacken his memory  his haughty behaviour  and unguarded expressions  had entirely alienated her affections  and imprinted an asperity  which  it seems  even his death could not soften   With the death of this favourite  Elizabeth s pleasures seemed to expire  she went through the business of the state merely from habit  but her happiness was no more  Historians are fond of representing all their characters without passion  and give to every action of the great either political or rational motives  they therefore treat this Queen s affection as a fable  but many of the actions of her life appear dictated by resentment or regard  nor ever had woman a greater variety of caprice  the great feel as the rest of mankind    294 and her passions were particularly violent and lasting  She lived but a short time after the death of Essex  and had the mortification of being forsaken by most of her courtiers before she died  who now strove to court the favour of King James  whom she had appointed her successor  She died in the seventieth year of her age  and the forty fourth of her reign  Her character differed with her circumstances  in the beginning of her reign she was moderate and humble  towards the end haughty and severe  she was indebted to her good fortune that her ministers were excellent  but it was owing to her want of wisdom that her favourites  who were chosen more immediately by herself  were unworthy  Tho  she was possessed of excellent sense  yet she never had the discernment to discover that she wanted beauty  to flatter her charms  even at the age of sixty five  was the surest way of gaining her interest and esteem  She was greater in her public than her private character  and they most disliked and feared her who were placed next her person  But  whatever might have been the Queen s character  the character of her people  at that period  demands our praise and imitation  Permit me to reserve that glorious picture of genius  struggling to get free from barbarity  to the succeeding letter   I am   c     295  LETTER XXXVII   WHATEVER punishments or cruelties were exerted in this reign  they mostly fell upon the Great  but never was the people of England more happy internally  or more formidable abroad  than during this period  the vices and virtues of a nation are often wholly ascribed to the Monarch who rules them  but such influence extends only through a narrow sphere  no single reign  however good  nor indeed any succession of virtuous reigns  can give happiness  morals  and arts  a general spread  unless the people be pre disposed for the reception  From Nerva to Antoninus  what a noble succession of Roman Emperors  and yet  even under them  Rome was declining fast into barbarity  it was not owing to Elizabeth alone  that England enjoyed all its present happiness  the people  as if spontaneously  began to exert their native vigour  and every art and every genius put forth all their powers   The English were put in possession of neither new nor splendid acquisitions  nor had they such great influence in foreign courts  but commerce grew up among them  and  almost without a protector  flourished with vigour  The people now began to know their real element  and this rendered them more happy than the foreign conquests or the former victories of their celebrated kings  a nation  which was once subject to every invasion  and the prey of every plunderer  now became powerful  polite  laborious  and enterprizing  The newly successful voyages of the Spaniards and Portuguese excited their emulation  they fitted out several expeditions for discovering a northern   296 passage to China  and  though disappointed in their aim  their voyages were not wholly fruitless  Drake and Cavendish surrounded the globe  and discovered skill and courage superior to those very nations which had first shewn them the way  The famous Sir Walter Raleigh  without any assistance from the government  colonized New England  these expeditions at length formed one of the most powerful marines of Europe  and they were able to oppose the fleet of Spain  called by the boasting title of the Invincible Armada  with an hundred ships  when this fleet of Spain had been destroyed  partly by tempests and partly by conduct  the English remained masters at sea  This superiority was constantly increasing  till another victory  gained over the fleet of Philip III  gained them a naval sovereignty  which they have ever since inviolably preserved  and which has
