night  tho  for some private reasons best known to himself  said she  he   had ordered his people to give out he was gone to Marli       De Freville  who was the creature of madame de Olonne  no sooner   received this intelligence than she flew with it to her  as mademoiselle   de Coigney had imagined  neither did it fail of the desired effect  When   he came to visit her  as he did on the moment of his return from Marli    the violence of her temper made her break out into such reproaches and   exclamations  as a man had need be very much in love to endure  he   endeavoured to make her sensible of her error by a thousand   protestations  but the more he talk d of Marli and the king s command    the more she told him of Charlotta and the masquerade  and almost   distracted to find he still persisted in denying he was there  or had   ever made any tender professions to that lady  she proceeded to such   extravagancies as he  who knew himself innocent  could not forbear   replying to in terms which were far from being softening   in fine  they   quarrelled to a very high degree  and some company happening to come in   at the same time  hindered either of them from saying any thing which   might palliate the resentment of the other       Before they had an opportunity of meeting again  mademoiselle de Coigney   saw her brother  and artfully introducing some discourse of mademoiselle   Charlotta de Palfoy  began to run into the utmost encomiums on that   lady s beauty  virtue  wit  and sweetness of disposition  and at last   added  that she should think herself happy in having her for a sister    Young de Coigney listened attentively to what she said  he had often   been in her company  but being prepossessed with his passion for madame   de Olonne  her charms had not that effect on him as now that the   behaviour of the other had very much lessened his esteem of her       He replied  that he knew no lady more deserving than the person she   mentioned  and should be glad if  by her interest  he might have   permission to visit her  this was all mademoiselle de Coigney wanted    she doubted not but if he were once engaged in an honourable passion  it   would entirely cure him of all regard for madame de Olonne  and as she   knew he had a good share of understanding  thought that when he should   come to a more near acquaintance with the perfections of Charlotta  the   loose airs of the other would appear in their true colours  and become   as odious to him as once they had been infatuating       Finding him so well inclined to her purpose  she took upon herself the   care of introducing him  as it was indeed easy to do  considering the   intimacy there was between her and Charlotta  That young lady received   him as the brother of a person she extremely loved  and little   suspecting the design on which he came  treated him with a gaity which   heightened her charms  and at the same time flattered his hopes  that   there was something in his person not disagreeable to her       Mademoiselle de Coigney took care that every visit he made to Charlotta   should be reported to de Olonne  which still heightening her resentment    together with his little assiduity to moderate it  made a total breach   between them  to the great satisfaction of all his friends in general    Those of them whom mademoiselle had acquainted with the stratagem by   which she brought it about  praised her wit and address  and as they   knew the family and fortune of mademoiselle Charlotta  encouraged her to   do every thing in her power for turning that into reality which she at   first had made use of only as a feint for the reclaiming of her brother       The young gentleman himself stood in need of no remonstrances of the   advantages he might propose by a marriage with Charlotta  her beauty and   the charms of her conversation had made a conquest of his heart far more   complete than any prospect of interest could have done  not only de   Olonne  but the whole sex would now in vain have endeavoured to attract   the least regard from him  and as he was naturally vain  he thought   nothing but Charlotta de Palfoy worthy of him       The success he had been accustomed to meet in his love affairs    emboldened him to declare himself much sooner than he would have done   had he followed the advice of his sister  and too soon to be received in   a manner agreeable to his wishes by a lady of Charlotta s modesty and
