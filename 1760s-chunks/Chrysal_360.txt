the conduct of his life      He had been some time in this hopeful course of education  when   an accident opened him an opportunity of showing what a progress   he had made in it  A brother of the person   about whose house   he picked up the scraps that kept him alive  happening to see one   of the servants beating him unmercifully  interfered from mere   humanity  and saved him  The marks he bore of his beating   raised a curiosity to know how he had deserved it   when he gave   so seemingly innocent and pitiable an account of himself  and attri    buted the servant s cruelty so artfully to his having refused to do   something for him which was improper for him to do  that the young   gentleman believed him  and taking compassion on his distress    admitted him into the family to wait upon himself  by which he   was delivered from his dependence on the other servants  and pro    tected from their future insults  The humility with which he   behaved himself in this first step of his advancement  his assiduity   and seeming attachment to his master  soon won his good opinion   so far  that he dispensed with his attendance and sent Hm to school    where he applied himself so closely  and made such a proficiency    that his master took him into his own business   in which lus   sobriety  diligence  and obedient temper gained his confidence   BO entirely  that  as soon as ever he thought him capable  he ad    mitted him into fellowship with himself  and absolutely resigned   the management of his whole business to him  It may naturally   be supposed that he did not neglect to improve such an oppor    tunity of practising the lessons he had learned in his youth  He   secreted the profits of all the business  which his principal was not   indispensably obliged to be personally engaged in   he supplanted   him with such as he could of his customers   he cheated of con    siderable sums of money such others  as long experience of his  the   principal s  honesty had put ofiE their guard with him   and took   every occasion of insinuating to the world  under the most effectual   disguise of friendly concern and complaint  his negligence and   incapacity   at the same time  that he professed to himself the most   impUcit respect and obedience  and seemed ambitious of showing   his gratitude and attachment  by performing the same servile ofSces   which had been his first occupation about him        Mr Burgh  Davis s Olio           ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 433     But all this was trifling in comparison with the stroke he made   against him in his own family  There was a near relation of his   principal s   who was indebted to his friendly assistance for the   first step of his rise to the rank of colonel in the army  Nature   had been layish to him in the endowments of mind and body   but   pride marred the blessing  and turned them all to his disadvantage    Confidence in the external graces of his person made him neglect   the improvement of his understanding   while an affection of   singularity  which is always assumed as a mask to hide real ignor    ance  made him set his own opinion in opposition to the established   judgment of mankind  As the conduct of such a man must neces    sarily be irregular  his relation and friend  my master s principal    exerted the authority of those characters  and frequently reproved   him in the sincerity and well meaning of his heart  The notion that   this liberty  which when properly taken is the highest proof of   regard  was assumed on the score of obligation  gave offence to the   captious haughtiness of the colonel s temper  and estranged an   esteem which it ought to have confirmed      This was an opportunity for my master to display his talents    He studied the temper of the colonel  and paid court to his caprices    He cringed to his haughtiness  bore his insults  and ministered to   his vices  with an implicit submission to his superior sense and   judgment  which he received as the only standard of right and   wrong      The contrast between his complaisance and the superiority   which the colonel thought his relation assumed by giving him   advice  insensibly transferred to my master that regard which his   principal lost  As this was what he had all along aimed at  he   omitted nothing to widen the breach by insinuations so artfully   conveyed as to aggravate the offence taken by the colonel  and yet    if repeated  would bear a
