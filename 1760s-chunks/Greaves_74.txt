for the liberty he had taken  proceeded to unfold his business  He said  information had been lodged with him  as a justice of the peace  against two armed men on horseback  who had stopped five farmers on the king s highway  put them in fear and danger of their lives  and even assaulted  maimed  and wounded divers persons  contrary to the king s peace  and in violation of the statute  that  by the description  he supposed the knight and his companion to be the persons against whom the complaint had been lodged  and  understanding his quality from Mr  Clarke  whom he had known in London  he was come to wait upon him  and  if possible  effect an accommodation   Our adventurer having thanked him for the polite and obliging manner in which he proceeded  frankly told him the whole story  as it had been just related by the captain  and Mr  Elmy had no reason to doubt the truth of the narrative  as it confirmed every circumstance which Clarke had before reported  Indeed  Tom had been very communicative to this gentleman  and made him acquainted with the whole history of Sir Launcelot Greaves  as well as with the whimsical resolution of his uncle  Captain Crowe  Mr  Elmy now told the knight  that the persons whom the captain had stopped were farmers  returning from a neighbouring market  a set of people naturally boorish  and at that time elevated with ale to an uncommon pitch of insolence  that one of them  in particular  called Prickle  was the most quarrelsome fellow in the whole county  and so litigious  that he had maintained above thirty lawsuits  in eight and twenty of which he had been condemned in costs  He said the others might be easily influenced in the way of admonition  but there was no way of dealing with Prickle  except by the form and authority of the law  He therefore proposed to hear evidence in a judicial capacity  and his clerk being in attendance  the court was immediately opened in the knight s apartment   By this time Mr  Clarke had made such good use of his time in explaining the law to his audience  and displaying the great wealth and unbounded liberality of Sir Launcelot Greaves  that he had actually brought over to his sentiments the constable and the commonalty  tag rag  and bob tail  and even staggered the majority of the farmers  who  at first  had breathed nothing but defiance and revenge  Farmer Stake being first called to the bar  and sworn touching the identity of Sir Launcelot Greaves and Captain Crowe  declared  that the said Crowe had stopped him on the king s highway  and put him in bodily fear  that he afterwards saw the said Crowe with a pole or weapon  value threepence  breaking the king s peace  by committing assault and battery against the heads and shoulders of his majesty s liege subjects  Geoffrey Prickle  Hodge Dolt  Richard Bumpkin  Mary Fang  Catherine Rubble  and Margery Litter  and that he saw Sir Launcelot Greaves  Baronet  aiding  assisting  and comforting the said Crowe  contrary to the king s peace  and against the form of the statute   Being asked if the defendant  when he stopped them  demanded their money  or threatened violence  he answered he could not say  inasmuch as the defendant spoke in an unknown language  Being interrogated if the defendant did not allow them to pass without using any violence  and if they did not pass unmolested  the deponent replied in the affirmative  Being required to tell for what reason they returned  and if the defendant Crowe was not assaulted before he began to use his weapon  the deponent made no answer  The depositions of farmer Bumpkin and Muggins  as well as of Madge Litter and Mary Fang  were taken to much the same purpose  and his worship earnestly exhorted them to an accommodation  observing  that they themselves were in fact the aggressors  and that Captain Crowe had done no more than exerted himself in his own defence   They were all pretty well disposed to follow his advice  except farmer Prickle  who  entering the court with a bloody handkerchief about his head  declared that the law should determine it at next  size  and in the meantime insisted that the defendants should find immediate bail  or go to prison  or be set in the stocks  He affirmed that they had been guilty of an affray  in appearing with armour and weapons not usually worn  to the terror of others  which is in itself a breach of the peace  but that they had  moreover  with force of arms  that is to say  with swords  staves  and other warlike instruments  by turns  made an assault and affray  to the terror and disturbance of him and divers subjects of our lord the King  then and there being  and to the evil and pernicious example of the liege people of the said lord the King  and against the peace of our said lord the King  his crown and dignity   The peasant had purchased a few law terms at a considerable expense  and he thought he had a right to turn his knowledge to the annoyance of all his
