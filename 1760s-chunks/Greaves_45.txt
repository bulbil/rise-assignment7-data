with a woollen night cap on his head  and a pair of spectacles on his nose  reading very earnestly in a book  which he afterwards understood was entitled  The Life and Adventures of Valentine and Orson  The captain no sooner saw his great pattern enter  than he rose  and received him with the salutation of   What cheer  brother   and before the knight could answer  added these words   You see how the land lies—here have Tom and I been fast ashore these four and twenty hours  and this berth we have got by attempting to tow your galley  brother  from the enemy s harbour  Adds bobs  if we had this here fellow w— eson for a consort  with all our tackle in order  brother  we d soon show  em the topsail  slip our cable  and down with their barricadoes  But  howsomever  it don t signify talking—patience is a good stream anchor  and will hold  as the saying is—but  d—n my—as for the matter of my boltsprit —Harkye  harkye  brother  d—ned hard to engage with three at a time  one upon my bow  one upon my quarter  and one right a head  rubbing and drubbing  lying athwart hawse  raking fore and aft  battering and grappling  and lashing and clashing—adds heart  brother  crash went the bolt sprit— down came the round top—up with the deadlights—I saw nothing but the stars at noon  lost the helm of my seven senses  and down I broached upon my broadside    As Mr  Clarke rightly conceived that his uncle would need an interpreter  he began to explain these hints  by giving a circumstantial detail of his own and the captain s disaster   He told Sir Launcelot  that  notwithstanding all his persuasion and remonstrances  Captain Crowe insisted upon appearing in the character of a knight errant  and  with that view  had set out from the public house on the morning that succeeded his vigil in the church  That upon the highway they had met with a coach  containing two ladies  one of whom seemed to be under great agitation  for  as they passed  she struggled with the other  thrust out her head at the window  and said something which he could not distinctly hear  That Captain Crowe was struck with admiration of her unequalled beauty  and he  Tom  no sooner informed him who she was  than he resolved to set her at liberty  on the supposition that she was under restraint  and in distress  That he accordingly unsheathed his cutlass  and  riding after the coach  commanded the driver to bring to  on pain of death  That one of the servants  believing the captain to be a highwayman  presented a blunderbuss  and in all probability would have shot him on the spot  had not he  the nephew  rode up  and assured them the gentleman was non compos  That  notwithstanding his intimation  all the three attacked him with the butt ends of their horsewhips  while the coach drove on  and although he laid about him with great fury  at last brought him to the ground  by a stroke on the temple  That Mr  Clarke himself then interposed in defence of his kinsman  and was also severely beaten  That two of the servants  upon application to a justice of the peace  residing near the field of battle  had granted a warrant against the captain and his nephew  and  without examination  committed them as idle vagrants  after having seized their horses and their money  on pretence of their being suspected for highwaymen    But  as there was no just cause of suspicion   added he   I am of opinion  the justice is guilty of a trespass  and may be sued for falsum imprisonamentum  and considerable damages obtained  for you will please to observe  sir  no justice has a right to commit any person till after due examination  besides  we were not committed for an assault and battery  audita querela  nor as wandering lunatics by the statute  who  to be sure  may be apprehended by a justice s warrant  and locked up and chained  if necessary  or to be sent to their last legal settlement  but we were committed as vagrants and suspected highwaymen  Now we do not fall under the description of vagrants  nor did any circumstance appear to support the suspicion of robbery  for  to constitute robbery  there must be something taken  but here nothing was taken but blows  and they were upon compulsion  Even an attempt to rob  without any taking  is not felony  but a misdemeanour  To be sure  there is a taking in deed  and a taking in law  But still the robber must be in possession of a thing stolen  and we attempted to steal ourselves away  My uncle  indeed  would have released the young lady vi et armis  had his strength been equal to his inclination  and in so doing  I would have willingly lent my assistance  both from a desire to serve such a beautiful young creature  and also in regard to your honour  for I thought I heard her call upon your name     Ha
