a pawnbroker s shop in Thieving Lane  and as he was   sitting in a little room behind the counter  that  it seems  shuts in   with glass doors  who should he see through the window but Mrs  Prinks   come in  she brought my lady s diamond necklace  and pledged it for a   hundred and twenty  or a hundred and thirty guineas  I am not sure which   he told me  for I have the saddest memory  but it is no matter for that    John was strangely confounded  as you may think  but resolved to see   into the bottom  and when Mrs  Prinks was got into the coach  popped up   behind it  and got down when it stopped  which was at the sign of the   Hand and Tipstaff in Knaves Acre  so that this money was raised to get   somebody that was arrested out of the bailiffs hands  for John said it   was what they call a spunging house that Mrs  Prinks went into  Lord    how deceitful some people are  My poor master little thinks how his   money goes  but I ll warrant our housekeeping must suffer for this        This gossipping young hussey would have run on much longer  doubtless    with her comments on this affair  but hearing Miss Flora s foot upon the   stairs  she left off  and opening the door  softly slipped into her   lady s dressing room  and fell to work in cleaning it       Miss Flora came up  exclaiming on the ill behaviour of most servants    telling Miss Betsy what a passion her mamma had been in  The other made   little answer to what she said on that or any other score  having her   thoughts very much taken up with the account just given her by Nanny    she recollected that Lady Mellasin had never dressed since that day    always making some excuse to avoid paying any grand visits  which she   now doubted not but it was because she had not her necklace  It very   much amazed her  as she well knew her ladyship was not without a good   deal of ready cash  therefore was certain the sum must be large indeed   for which her friend was arrested  that it reduced her to the necessity   of applying to a pawnbroker  and who that friend could be  for whom she   would thus demean herself  puzzled her extremely  It was not long    however  before she was let into the secret  but  in the mean time    other matters of more moment must be treated on                CHAPTER XVII       Is of less importance than the former  yet must not be omitted          Lady Mellasin having vented her spleen on those who  by their stations    were obliged to bear it  and the object of it removed out of the house    became extremely cheerful the remaining part of the day  The fashion in   which it might be supposed Miss Betsy would be accosted by the tarpaulin   inamorato  and the reception she would give his passion  occasioned a   good deal of merriment  and even Mr  Goodman  seeing his dear wife took   part in it  would sometimes throw in his joke        Well  well   cried Miss Betsy  to heighten the diversion   what will   you say now  if I should take a fancy to the captain  so far as to   prefer him to any of those who think it worth their while to solicit me   on the score of love         This is quite ungenerous in you   cried Miss Flora   did you not   promise to turn the captain over to me when you had done with   him     That may not happen a great while   replied the other   for  I   assure you  I have seen him three or four times  when he has called here   on business to Mr  Goodman  and think  to part with a lover of his   formidable aspect  would be to deprive myself of the most conspicuous of   my whole train of admirers  But suppose   continued she  in the same gay   strain   I resign to you Mr  Staple or Mr  Trueworth  would that not do   as well         Do not put me in the head of either of them  I beseech you   said Miss   Flora   for fear I should think too seriously on the matter  and it   should not be in your power to oblige me         All that must be left to chance   cried Miss Betsy   but so far I dare
