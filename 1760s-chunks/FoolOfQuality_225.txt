doors   off  desired to speak with me   and as they who are sinking catch   at any thing for their support  my heart fluttered in the hope   of some happy reverse  Accordingly I followed the messenger    His appearance in dress and person was altogether that of the   gentleman      He ordered all others out of the room  and requesting me to sit   beside him  in a half whispering voice he began   I am come  Mr    Stern  from one whom you have great reason to account your   greatest enemy  I come from Mr  Delvil  at whose suit your   daughter now lies in prison  I started  Be patient  sir  he said    He knows your distresses he knows all your wants he knows   also that he is the author of them   yet I tell you that he feels   them as if they were his own  and that it was not his enmity  but   his love  that occasioned them      He depends on his old uncle Dimmock for a vast fortune in ex    pectation  He saw your daughter  and loved her  he saw her   again  and loved her to madness  He inquired her family  her   character  and found that he had nothing to expect from any   licentious proposal  He feared  however  that all must love her as   he did  and  to prevent other pirates  he made use of the stratagem   which  contrary to his intentions  has brought you here  He never   meant any thing dishonourable by your daughter  Had he carried   her clear off  you might all have been happy together at this day     and  if you consent  he will marry her here in the presence of a few   witnesses  who shall be sworn to secresy till his uncle s death    and he will instantly pay you down three hundred pounds in re    compense for your sufferings  and will settle one hundred pounds   annuity on your child for life      I must own that  to one in my circumstances  this proposal had   something very tempting in it  But who is this Mr  Delvil   said I          234 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      I know him not   I never saw him  I am the man  sir  said he    I would have discharged my action as I came to this place   but   I dare not permit your daughter to get out of my custody   for    at the loss of my fortune at the loss of my life I am deter    mined that no other man living shall possess her  I then promised   him that I would make a faithful narration to my child of all that   had passed  but told him  at the same time  that I would wholly   subscribe to her pleasure   and so we parted      As soon as I represented this matter to my Diana no   my   papa  she cried  it is impossible it never can be  I would do   any thing suffer any thing but this  for your relief  Would you   act the marriage of the lamb and the wolf in the fable   If such   have been the consequences of this gentleman s affection for us    what have we not to expect from the effects of his aversion  I   would prefer any kind of death to a life with such a man  And   then  my mother  she cried  and burst into tears my dear mother   whom he has murdered  Though he were worth half the world    and would marry me publicly in the face of the other half  it   will not be it cannot be  indeed  my papa      Hereupon I writ Mr  Delvil almost a literal account of my daugh    ter s answer  It is nearly five weeks since this happened  and   we have not heard any thing further of him  In this time  how    ever  we got acquainted with a family at the next door  whose con    verse has been a great consolation to us  There is a father and   mother  and seven small children boys and girls   they are very   worthy people  and of noble descent   but how they contrive to   live at all I cannot conceive  for they have no visible means of   making a penny  Had we not known them  we should have   thought ourselves the poorest of all creatures   We must own   them more deserving of your charity than we are      Here poor Mr  Stern ended   and you cannot think  dada  how   my heart leapt with
