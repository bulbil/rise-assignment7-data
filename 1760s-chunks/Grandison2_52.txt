fancy  have  in all those sentiments which are not borrowed  been very superficial  How can it be otherwise   The conversation in the coach turned upon their own family  for I put in my claim to Miss Grandison s former promise on that head   from which I gather d the following particulars   Sir Thomas Grandison was one of the handsomest men of his time  He had a great notion of magnificence in living  and went deep into all the fashionable diversions  except gaming with cards and dice  tho  he ran into one as expensive  but which he called a nobler vice  valuing himself upon his breed of race horses and hunters  and upon his kennel  in both which articles he was extravagant to profusion   His father  Sir Charles  was as frugal as Sir Thomas was profuse  He was a purchaser all his life  and left his son  besides an estate of 6 000 l  a year in England  and near 2 000 l  a year in Ireland  rich in money   His Lady was of a noble family  sister to Lord W    129 She was  as you have already been told  the most excellent of women  I was delighted to see her two daughters bear testimony to her goodness  and to their own worth  by their tears  It was impossible  in the character of so good a woman  not to think of my own mamma  and I could not help  on the remembrance  joining my tears with theirs   Miss Jervois also wept  not only from tenderness of nature  and sympathy  but  as she owned  from regret  that she had not the same reason to rejoice in a living mother  as we had to remember affectionately the departed   What I have written  and shall farther write  to the disadvantage of Sir Thomas Grandison  I gather d from what was dropt by one Lady  and by the other  at different times  for it was beautiful to observe with what hesitation and reluctancy they mentioned any of his failings  with what pleasure his good qualities  heightening the one  and extenuating the other  O my Lucy  how would their hearts have overflowed in his praises  had they had such a faultless father  and excellent man  as was my father  Sweet is the remembrance of good parents to good children   Lady Grandison brought a great fortune to Sir Thomas  He had a fine poetical vein  which he was fond of cultivating  Tho  his fortune was so ample  it was his person  and his verses  that won the Lady from several competitors  He had not  however  her judgment  He was a poet  and I have heard my grandfather say  that to be a poet  requires an heated imagination  which often runs away with the judgment   This Lady took the consent of all her friends in her choice  but here seemed an hint to drop from Lady L  that they consented  because it was her choice  for Sir Thomas  from the day he enter d upon his estate  set out in a way that every body concluded would diminish it   He made  however  a kind husband  as it is called    130 His good sense and his politeness  and the pride he took to be thought one of the best bred men in England  secured her complaisant treatment  But Lady Grandison had qualities that deserved one of the best and tenderest of men  Her eye and her ear had certainly misled her  I believe a woman  who chooses a man whom every body admires  if the man be not good  must expect that he will have calls and inclinations  that will make him think the character of a domestic man beneath him   She endeavoured  at setting out  to engage his companionableness—shall I call it  She was fond of her husband  He had reason to be  and was  proud of his wife  But when he had shew d her every where  and she began to find herself in circumstances which ought to domesticate a wife of a much gayer turn than Lady Grandison pretended to have  he gave way to his predominant byass  and after a while  leaving the whole family care to her  for her excellence in every branch of which he was continually praising her  He did her that justice  he was but little at home in the summer  and  in the winter  was generally engaged four months in the diversions of this great town  and was the common patron of all the performers whether at plays  operas  or concerts   At first setting out in this way  he was solicitous to carry his Lady with him to town  She always chearfully accepted of his invitation  when she saw he was urgent with her to go  She would not give a pretence for so gay a man to throw off that regard to appearances  which pride made him willing to keep up  But afterwards  his invitations growing fainter and fainter  and she finding that her presence lengthened the time of his stay in town  and added greatly to his expences  for he never would abate  when they were together  of
