   In the mean time his associates  on entering the wood  met with   another little posse of the village fry  who were on their return  one   of whom carried a bag of nuts that seemed bulkier than the bearer    So  gentlemen  says Lord Dicky  where are you going  Why    home where should we go  says a little boor sullenly  And    pray  what have you been doing  says the lord  Guess  says the   boor  Is it nuts that you have got in that bag   demanded the lord    Ask to morrow  answered the boor  Sirrah  says Dicky  a little     E revoked  how dare you to come and pull nuts here  without our   jave   Why  as for that  Mr  Dicky  replied the other  I know you   well enough  and I wouldn t ask your leave an  you were twenty   lords  not I  Sirrah  says Dicky  I have a great mind to take   your nuts from you  and to give you as good a beating  into the   bargain  as ever you got in your life  As for that  Mr  Dicky    coolly answered the villager  you must do both or neither  Here   I lay down my nuts between us   and now come any two of your         THE FOOL OF QVALITY  41     water gruel regiment  one down  t other come on   and if I don t   give ye your bellies full  why  then  take my nuts and welcome    to make up the want      This gallant invitation was accepted on the spot  Lord Richard   chose his companion in arms  and both appeared quite flush and   confident of victory   for  though neither of them had been versed in   the gymnastic exercises  they did not want courage  and they knew   that their challenger was their inferior in strength and in years      But  unhappily for these two champions of quality  Tommy Truck    their adversary  had  like Harry  been a bruiser from two years old   and upward  and was held in veneration  as their leader and their   chief  by many who were his superiors in age and stature      Lord Richard began the assault  but was down in a twinkling    To him his friend succeeded  but with no better fortune  A swing   or trip of Tommy s sent them instantly  as Alcides sent Antseus    to gather strength from their mother earth  And though these   summer heroes  like the young Roman nobility at the battle of   Pharsalia  were solely intent on defending their pretty faces from   annoyance  yet Tommy  at the third turn  had bloodied them both      Harry  who was now on his return  perceived the engagement     and running up  and rushing hi between the combatants  interposed   with a voice of authority  and parted the fray      Having inquired  and duly informed himself of the merits of the   case  he first turned him to Lord Richard  and said O brother   Dicky  brother Dicky  you ought not to hinder poor boys from   pulling a few dirty nuts what signifies  em   Then turning to the   challenger  his old acquaintance Tommy  says he  did you know   that Dicky was my brother  Yes  says Tommy rudely  and what   though if I did  O nothing at all  says Harry  but I want to   speak with you  Tommy  Whereupon he took the conqueror under   the arm  and walked away with him  very lovingly in all ap    pearance  looking about to take care that none of the boys   followed him      Meantime the little gentry threw out their invectives in profusion   against our departed hero  I think  says one  that Master Harry   had as much to blame in Tommy as Lord Dicky  Ay  says another    one would think he might as well have taken his brother s part as   that blackguard s  Indeed  it was very naughty of him  says a   third  For my part  says a fourth  I will never have any thing   more to say to him      While thus they vilified their late friend  he and his fellow cham    pion walked arm in arm in a sullen and uninterrupted silence  till   coming to a small opening  in a secret part of the wood  Harry   quitted his companion  desired him to strip  and instantly cast   aside his own hat  coat  and waistcoat  Why should I strip   says   Tommy  To box
