spare time  I should be glad if you will      make a short trip and see your aunt  and him who is  Your      loving godfather and humble servant                                       Hawser Trunnion       P S  If you want money  you may draw upon me payable at sight    CHAPTER XXVI     6 22 15  3 45 PM   He becomes Melancholy and Despondent  Is favoured with the condescending  Letter from his Uncle  Reconciles himself to his Governor  and sets out  with Emilia and her Friend for Mrs  Gauntlet s House   Peregrine  fortified as he was with pride and indignation  did not fail  to feel the smarting suggestions of his present situation  after having  lived so long in an affluent and imperious manner  he could ill brook  the thoughts of submitting to the mortifying exigencies of life  All the  gaudy schemes of pomp and pleasure  which his luxuriant imagination had  formed  began to dissolve  a train of melancholy ideas took possession  of his thoughts  and the prospect of losing Emilia was not the least  part of his affliction  Though he endeavoured to suppress the chagrin  that preyed upon his heart  he could not conceal the disturbance of his  mind from the penetration of that amiable young lady  who sympathized  with him in her heart  though she could not give her tongue the liberty  of asking the cause of his disorder  for  notwithstanding all the ardour  of his addresses  he never could obtain from her the declaration of  a mutual flame  because  though he had hitherto treated her with the  utmost reverence of respect  he had never once mentioned the final  aim of his passion  However honourable she supposed it to be  she had  discernment enough to foresee that vanity or interest  co operating with  the levity of youth  might one day deprive her of her lover  and she was  too proud to give him any handle of exulting at her expense  Although  he was received by her with the most distinguished civility  and even  an intimacy of friendship  all his solicitations could never extort  from her an acknowledgment of love  on the contrary  being of a gay  disposition  she sometimes coquetted with other admirers  that his  attention thus whetted might never abate  and that he might see she had  other resources in case he should flag in his affection   This being the prudential plan on which she acted  it cannot be supposed  that she would condescend to inquire into the state of his thoughts when  she saw him thus affected  but she  nevertheless  imposed that task  on her cousin and confidant  who  as they walked together in the park  observed that he seemed to be out of humour  When this is the case  such  a question generally increases the disease  at least it had that effect  upon Peregrine  who replied somewhat peevishly   I assure you  madam   you never were more mistaken in your observations     I think so   too   said Emilia   for I never saw Mr  Pickle in higher spirits   This  ironical encomium completed his confusion  he affected to smile  but it  was a smile of anguish  and in his heart he cursed the vivacity of both   He could not for his soul recollect himself so as to utter one connected  sentence  and the suspicion that they observed every circumstance of  his behaviour  threw such a damp on his spirits that he was quite  overwhelmed with shame and resentment  when Sophy  casting her eyes  towards the gate  said   Yonder is your servant  Mr  Pickle  with  another man who seems to have a wooden leg   Peregrine started at this  intelligence  and immediately underwent sundry changes of complexion   knowing that his fate  in a great measure  depended upon the information  he would receive from his friend   Hatchway  advancing to the company  after a brace of sea bows to the  ladies  took the youth aside  and put the commodore s letter into  his hand  which threw him into such an agitation that he could scarce    6 22 15  3 45 PM   pronounce   Ladies  will you give me leave   When  in consequence of  their permission  he attempted to open the billet  he fumbled with such  manifest disorder  that his mistress  who watched his motions  began to  think that there was something very interesting in the message  and so  much was she affected with his concern  that she was fain to turn her  head another way  and wipe the tears from her lovely eyes   Meanwhile  Peregrine no sooner read the first sentence than his  countenance  which before was overcast with a deep gloom  began to be  lighted up  and every feature unbending
