of one another at the battle of the Wood —Why should I tire you with a description of our unutterable   14 sorrow at the fatal news of this event  the remembrance of which now fills my aged eyes with tears  When our grief subsided a little  and reflection came to our aid  we found ourselves deserted by the whole world  and in danger of perishing for want  Whereupon we made application for the pension  and were put upon the list  Then vowing eternal friendship  sold our jewels and superfluous cloaths  retired to this place  which is in the county of Sussex  bought this little house  where we lived may years in a solitary manner  indulging our mutual sorrow   till it pleased heaven to call away my companion  two years ago  since which time I have lingered out an unhappy being  in hopes of a speedy dissolution  when I promise myself the eternal reward of all my cares —In the mean time   continued she  I must inform you of the character I bear among my neighbours —My conversation being different from that of the inhabitants of the village  my recluse way of life  my skill in curing distempers  which I acquired from books since I settled here  and lastly  my age  have made the common people look upon me as something preternatural  and I am actually at this hour believed to be a witch  The person of the parish  whose acquaintance I have not been at much pains to cultivate  taking umbrage at my supposed disrespect  has contributed not a little towards the confirmation of this opinion  by dropping certain hints to my prejudice  among the vulgar  who are also very much scandalized at my entertaining this poor tabby   15 cat with the collar about her neck  which was a favourite of my deceased companion      The whole behaviour of this venerable person  was so primitive  innocent  sensible  and humane  that I contracted a filial respect for her  and begged her advice with regard to my future conduct  as soon as I was in a condition to act for myself —She dissuaded me from a design I had formed of travelling to London in hopes of retrieving my cloaths and pay  by returning to my ship  which by this time  I read in a newspaper  was safely arrived in the river Thames     Because  said she  you run the hazard of being treated not only as a deserter  in quitting the sloop  but also as a mutineer in assaulting your commanding officer  to the malice of whose revenge you will moreover be exposed  —  She then promised to recommend me as a servant to a single lady of her acquaintance  who lived in the neighbourhood with her nephew  who was a young fox hunter of great fortune  where I might be very happy  provided I could bear with the disposition and manners of my mistress  which were somewhat whimsical and particular —But above all things  she counselled me to conceal my story  the knowledge of which would effectually poison my entertainment  for it was a maxim among most people of condition  that no gentleman in distress ought to be admitted into a family  as a domestick  lest he become proud  lazy  and insolent —I was fain to embrace this humble proposal  because my affairs were desperate  and in a few days was hired by this lady  to serve in quality of her footman  being represented by my hostess  as a young man  who having been sent to sea by his relations   16 against his inclinations  was shipwrecked and robbed  which had encreased his disgust to that way of life so much  that he rather chose to go to service on shore than enter himself on board of any other ship —Before I took possession of my new place  she gave me a sketch of my mistress s character  that I might know better how to regulate my conduct    Your lady  said she  is a maiden of forty years  not so remarkable for her beauty as her learning and taste  which is famous all over the county —Indeed she is a perfect female virtuosi  and so eager after the pursuit of knowledge  that she neglects her person even to a degree of sluttishness  this negligence  together with her contempt for the male part of the creation  gives her nephew no great concern  as by that means  he will probably keep her fortune  which is considerable  in the family  He therefore permits her to live in her own way  which is something extraordinary  and gratifies her in all her whimsical desires —Her apartment is at some distance from the other inhabited parts of the house  and consists of a dining room  bed chamber and study  She keeps a cookmaid  waiting woman  and footman of her own  and seldom eats or converses with any of the family  but her niece  who is a very lovely creature  and humours her aunt often to the prejudice of her own health  by sitting up with her whole nights together  for your mistress is too much of a philosopher to be swayed by the customs of the world  and never sleeps or eats as other people do —Among other odd notions  she professes the principles of
