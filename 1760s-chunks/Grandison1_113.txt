 a year  and who had declared himself absolutely disengaged in her affections  was not doing dishonour to her  so much as to himself  in the violent measures his Love obliged him to take to make her so   Now  madam  as Sir Charles Grandison was utterly a stranger to you  as Sir Hargrave intended so honourably by you  and  as you are not engaged in your affections  if you will consent to be Lady Pollexfen  and if Sir Charles Grandison will ask pardon for his unprovoked knight errantry  I will not be Sir Hargrave s second in the affair  if he refuse to accept of such satisfaction in full for the violence he sustained   I solemnly repeat  that Sir Hargrave knows nothing of my writing to you  You may  but I insist upon it  as in confidence to every body else  consult your cousin Reeves on the subject  Your honour given  that you will in a month s time be Sir Hargrave s  will make me exert all my power with him  and I have reason to think that is not small  to induce him to compromise on those terms   I went to Sir Charles s house yesterday afternoon  with a Letter from Sir Hargrave  Sir Charles was just stepping into his chariot to his sister  He opened it  and  with a civility that became his character  told me he was just going with his sister to Colnebrooke  to meet dear friends on their return from Scotland  That he should return on Monday  that the pleasure he   278 should have with his long absent friends  would not permit him to think of the contents till then  But that the writer should not fail of such an answer as a gentleman ought to give   Now  madam  I was so much charm d with Sir Charles Grandison s sine person  and politeness  and his character is so extraordinary  that I thought this interval between this night and Monday morning an happy one  And I took it into my head to make the above proposal to you  and I hope you will think it behoves you  as much as it does me  to prevent the fatal mischief that may otherwise happen  to men of their consideration   I have not the honour of being personally known to you  madam  but my character is too generally established for any one to impute to me any other motives for this my application to you  than those above given  A line left for me at Sir Hargrave s  in Cavendishsquare  will come to the hands of  madam   Your most obedient humble Servant  JAMES BAGENHALL   O MY dear  What a Letter —Mr  Reeves  Mrs  Reeves  are grieved to the heart  Mr  Reeves says  that if Sir Hardgrave insists upon it  Sir Charles is obliged  in honour  to meet him—Murderous  vile word honour  What  at this rate  is honour  The very opposite to duty  goodness  piety  religion  and to every thing that is or ought to be sacred among men   How shall I look Miss Grandison in the face  Miss Grandison will hate me  To be again the occasion of endangering the life of such a brother   But  what do you think —Lady Betty is of opinion—Mr  Reeves has consulted Lady Betty Williams  in confidence—Lady Betty says  that if the matter can be prevented—Lord bless me  she says  I ought to prevent it —What  by becoming the wife of such a   279 man as Sir Hargrave  so unmanly  so malicious  so low a wretch —What does Lady Betty mean —Yet were it in my power to save the life of Sir Charles Grandison  and I refused to do it  for selfish reasons refused  for the sake of my worldly happiness  when there are thousands of good wives  who are miserable with bad husbands—But will not the sacrifice of my life be accepted by this sanguinary man  That  with all my heart  would I make no scruple to lay down  If the wretch will plunge a dagger in my bosom  and take that for satisfaction  I will not hesitate one moment   But my cousin said  that he was of opinion  that Sir Charles would hardly be brought to ask pardon  How can I doubt  said I  that the vile man  if he may be induced by this Bagenhall to compromise on my being his wife  will dispense with that punctilio  and wreak on me  were I to be his unhappy property  his whole unmanly vengeance  Is he not spiteful  mean  malicious —But  abhorred be the thought of my yeilding to be the wife of such a man —Yet  what is the alternative  Were I to die  that wretched alternative would still take place  His malice to the best of men would rather be whetted than blunted  by my irrevocable destiny  O my Lucy  violent as my grief was  dreadful as my apprehensions were  and unmanly as the treatment I met with from the base man  I never was distress d till now   But should Miss Grandison advise  should she insist upon my compliance with the abhorred condition  and has she not a right to insist
