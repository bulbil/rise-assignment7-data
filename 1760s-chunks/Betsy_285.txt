he had done reading   the   assurance I build on the sincerity of your attachment to me     Your   lordship does me an infinity of honour   replied the other with a low   bow   and I have nothing to regret  but that my sword must lie idle   while your lordship s is employed         As for that   resumed the peer   I always thought it the utmost folly   and injustice to set two people on cutting one another s throats  merely   in compliment to their friends  but  my dear Munden   pursued he    looking on his watch   I would have you go immediately  I believe you   will find him at the Cocoa Tree  he is generally there about this   hour  but if not  they will direct you where to find him        He sealed the letter while he was speaking  which being again delivered   to Mr  Munden  they both returned into the room where the ladies were    Mr  Munden stayed no longer than while his footman called a   hackney coach to the door  as he was going out  the nobleman said to   him   I doubt not but you will be back as soon as possible  in the mean   time we three will amuse ourselves with a game at ombre        Mrs  Munden was a good deal surprized at her husband s departure  but   had much more reason to be so  as well as alarmed  in a moment or two   after       Cards were but just laid upon the table  when a servant came hastily    and told the lady a messenger had brought word that her mother was   suddenly seized with an apoplectic fit  that it was not yet known   whether the old lady would recover  and that she must come home that   instant       On this she started up  seemed in a most terrible fright  and took her   leave with a precipitation natural enough to the occasion  in a daughter   possessed of any share of duty or affection       This part of the history must be very unintelligible indeed  if the   reader has not by this time seen  that all this was but a feint   contrivance by the amorous nobleman  in order to get an opportunity of   employing the whole battery of his rhetorick against the virtue he was   impatient to triumph over       This pretended kinswoman was  in fact  no more than a cast off mistress   of his lordship s  but  having her dependance entirely upon him  was   obliged to submit in every thing to his will  and become an assistant to   those pleasures with others which she could no longer afford him in her   own person       She was brought to his house that day for two reasons  first  as he knew   not what fears  and what apprehensions  the beauty of Mrs  Munden might   raise in her husband  and render him suspicious of the true motive of   his being sent away  had no other company been there  and  secondly  to   prevent that fair intended victim of his unwarrantable flame from being   too suddenly alarmed at finding herself alone with him       Mrs  Munden  however  had no time to examine into the meaning of what   she saw  and all she could recollect in that instant was  that she was   in the house  and wholly in the power  of a person who had designs upon   her  to which neither her honour  nor her inclinations  would permit her   to acquiesce  and trembled for the event  but concealing the disorders   of her mind as much as possible   Well  my lord   said she  taking up   the cards  and beginning to shuffle them   since we are deprived of a   third person by this melancholy accident  what thinks your lordship of a   game at picquet         I think   answered he  looking upon her with eyes which redoubled all   her terrors   that to waste the precious time in cards  and throw away   the golden opportunity of telling you how much my soul adores you  would   be a stupidity which neither love nor fortune could forgive me for        In speaking these words he snatched one of her hands  and  in spite of   her endeavours to withdraw it  pressed it to his mouth with an eagerness   which would have convinced her  if she had not been so before  of the   vehemence of those desires with which he was inflamed        Fie  my lord   cried she  with an air as haughty and
