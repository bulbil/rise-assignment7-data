of the unhappy situation she is in from such a mother  and I thought some hints would have been given of his desire that she should accompany me down to Northamptonshire  and my heart throbbed  to think how it would be brought in  and how I should behave upon it  And the more  as I was not to be supposed to have so much as heard of such a designed proposal  What would it have done  had I been prevailed upon to read the letter  But not one word passed  leading to that subject   I now begin to fear  that he has changed his mind  if that was his mind  Methinks I am more fond of having the good girl with us  than I imagined it was possible I ever could have been  What a different appearance have things to us  when they are out of our power  to what they had when we believed they were in it   But I see not  that there is the least likelihood that any thing  on which you had all set your hearts  can happen—I can t help it     113 Emily  flattering girl  told me  she saw great signs of attachment to me in his eyes and behaviour  but I see no grounds for such a surmise  His affections are certainly engaged  God bless him  whatever his engagements are —When he was absent  encouraged by his sisters and Lord L  I thought pretty well of myself  but  now he is present  I see so many excellencies shining out in his mind  in his air and address  that my humility gets the better of my ambition   Ambition  did I say  Yes  ambition  Lucy  Is it not the nature of the passion we are so foolishly apt to call noble  to exalt the object  and to lower  if not to debase  one s self—You see how Lord W  depreciates me on the score of fortune  I was loth to take notice of that before  because I knew  that were slenderness of fortune the only difficulty  the partiality of all my friends for their Harriet would put them upon making efforts that I would sooner die than suffer to be made   I forgot the manner in which Lord W  s objection was permitted to go off—But I remember  Sir Charles made no attempt to answer it  And yet he tells my Lord  that fortune is not a principal article with him  and that he has an ample estate of his own  No question but a man s duties will rise with his opportunities  A man  therefore  may be as good with a less estate  as with a larger  And is not goodness the essential part of happiness  Be our station what it will  have we any concern but humbly to acquiesce in it  and fulfil our duties   But who  for selfish considerations  can wish to circumscribe the power of this good man  The greater opportunities he has of doing good  the higher must be his enjoyment —No  Lucy  do not let us flatter ourselves   Sir Charles rejoices  on Sir Hargrave s having just now  by letter  suspended the appointment till next week  of his dining with him at his house on the forest     114  LETTER XV  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   I Left Sir Charles with Dr  Bartlett  They would both have engaged me to stay longer  but I thought the Ladies would miss me  and think it particular to find me with him in the doctor s closet   My Lord  and the two sisters  were together in the drawing room adjoining to the library  On my entrance  Well  Harriet  said Miss Grandison  we will now endeavour to find out my brother  You must be present to yourself  and put in a word now and then  We shall see if Dr  Bartlett is right  when he says  that my brother is the most unreserved of men   Just then came in Dr  Bartlett—I think  doctor  said Lady L  we will take your advice  and ask my brother all the questions in relation to his engagements abroad  that come into our heads   She had not done speaking  when Sir Charles entered  and drew his chair next me  and just then I thought myself he looked upon me with equal benignity and respect   Miss Grandison began with taking notice of the letter from which Dr  Bartlett  she said  had read some passages  of the happiness he had procured to Lord W  in ridding him of his woman  She wished  she told him  that she knew who was the Lady he had in his thoughts to commend to my Lord for a wife   I will have a little talk with her before I name her  even to you  my Lord  and my sisters  I am sure my sisters will approve of their aunt  if she accept of my Lord for a husband  I shall pay my compliments to her  in my return from Grandison hall —Do you  Charlotte  choose to accompany me thither  I must  I think  be present at the opening of the church  I   115 don
