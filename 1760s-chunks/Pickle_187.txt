 for which  however  they consoled themselves  by imputing the success to accident  but when  at the very next  stroke  he sprung it over the table  their countenances underwent an  instantaneous distraction of feature  and they waited  in the most  dreadful suspense  for the next hazard  which being likewise taken with  infinite ease by the soldier  the blood forsook their cheeks  and the  interjection  Zounds   pronounced with a look of consternation  and in a  tone of despair  proceeded from every mouth at the same instant of  time  They were overwhelmed with horror and astonishment at seeing  three hazards taken in as many strokes  from a person of their  friend s dexterity  and shrewdly suspected  that the whole was a scheme  preconcerted for their destruction  On this supposition  they changed  the note  and attempted to hedge for their own indemnification  by  proposing to lay the odds in favour of Gauntlet  but so much was the  opinion of the company altered by that young gentleman s success   that no one would venture to espouse the cause of his competitor  who   chancing to improve his game by the addition of another lucky hit   diminished the concern  and revived the hopes of his adherents   But this gleam of fortune did not long continue  Godfrey collected  his whole art and capacity  and  augmenting his score to number ten   indulged himself with a view of the whole fraternity  The visages of  these professors had adopted different shades of complexion at every  hazard he had taken  from their natural colour they had shifted into  a sallow hue  from thence into pale  from pale into yellow  which  degenerated into a mahogany tint  and now they saw seventeen hundred  pounds of their stock depending upon a single stroke  they stood like so  many swarthy Moors  jaundiced with terror and vexation  The fire which  naturally glowed in the cheeks and nose of the player  seemed utterly  extinct  and his carbuncles exhibited a livid appearance  as if a  gangrene had already made some progress in his face  his hand began to  shake  and his whole frame was seized with such trepidation  that he  was fain to swallow a bumper of brandy  in order to re establish the  tranquility of his nerves  This expedient  however  did not produce  the desired effect  for he aimed the ball at the lead with such  discomposure  that it struck on the wrong side  and came off at an  angle which directed it full in the middle hole  This fatal accident was  attended with a universal groan  as if the whole universe had gone to  wreck  and notwithstanding that tranquility for which adventurers are so  remarkable  this loss made such an impression upon them all  that each  in particular manifested his chagrin  by the most violent emotions  One  turned up his eyes to heaven  and bit his nether lip  another gnawed  his fingers  while he stalked across the room  a third blasphemed with  horrid imprecations  and he who played the party sneaked off  grinding  his teeth together  with a look that baffles all description  and as he  crossed the threshold  exclaiming   A d  d bite  by G      The victors  after having insulted them  by asking  if they were    6 22 15  3 45 PM   disposed for another chance  carried off their winning  with the  appearance of great composure  though in their hearts they were  transported with unspeakable joy  not so much on account of the booty  they had gained  as in consideration of having so effectually destroyed  such a nest of pernicious miscreants   Peregrine  believing that now he had found an opportunity of serving his  friend  without giving offence to the delicacy of his honour  told him   upon their arrival at their lodgings  that fortune had at length enabled  him to become in a manner independent  or at least make himself easy in  his circumstances  by purchasing a company with the money he had won   So saying  he put his share of the success in Gauntlet s hand  as a sum  that of right belonged to him  and promised to write in his behalf to  a nobleman  who had interest enough to promote such a quick rise in the  service   Godfrey thanked him for his obliging intention  but absolutely refused   with great loftiness of demeanour  to appropriate to his own use any  part of the money which Pickle had gained  and seemed affronted at the  other s entertaining a sentiment so unworthy of his character  He would  not even accept  in the way of loan  such an addition to his own stock   as would amount to the price of a company of foot  but expressed great  confidence in the future exertion of that talent which had been blessed  with such a prosperous beginning  Our hero finding him thus obstinately  deaf to the voice of his own interest  resolved to govern himself in  his next endeavours of friendship
