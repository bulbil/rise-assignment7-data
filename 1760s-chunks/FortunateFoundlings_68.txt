rest  and not very   well  would not disturb her  The first thing she did in the morning was   to run into the chamber and enquire after her health  which she did in   so affectionate and tender a manner  that it very much heightened the   other s trouble for her       It is certain that  setting aside too loose a way of thinking of virtue   and religion  and adhering to that false maxim  that a woman of rank is   above censure  Melanthe had many amiable qualities  and as she truly   loved Louisa  was alarmed at her supposed indisposition  which  to   conceal the perplexity her mind was in  she still continued to   counterfeit  as well as to avoid going to a masquerade  to which they   had some days before been invited  and which the present situation of   her thoughts left her no relish for       Melanthe would fain have perswaded her that this diversion would   contribute to restoring her  but she entreated to be excused  and the   other went without her       Monsieur du Plessis in the mean time having informed the count de   Bellfleur  how much it was in vain for him to flatter himself with any   hopes of Louisa  that proud and inconstant nobleman was extremely   mortified  and said  that since she was so haughty  he was resolved to   contrive some way or other to get her into his power  as well out of   revenge as inclination  This  the other represented to him  would be a   very ungenerous way of proceeding  and said  that as she refused his   addresses merely out of a principle of virtue  and not for the sake of a   more favoured rival  he ought to content himself  but these arguments   were lost on a man whom pride of blood  and an affluence of fortune  had   rendered too insolent and head strong to think any thing reason which   opposed his will  and they parted not well satisfied with each other    tho  du Plessis concealed part of the dislike he had of his principles   and manner of behaviour  on account of a long friendship between their   families  and also as the count was his superior in birth  in years  and   in the post he held in the army       He had no sooner left him than he came to Louisa  thinking it his duty   to give her warning of the count s design  and that it would be a proper   prelude to something else he had to say  As the servants knew she was   not perfectly well  they told him  they believed she would see no   company  but on his entreating it  and saying he had something of moment   to impart  one of them went in and repeated what he had said  on which   she gave leave for his admission       He rejoiced to find her alone  as he came prepared to reveal to her more   secrets than that of the count s menace  but the pleasure he took in   having so favourable an opportunity was very much damped  by seeing her   look more pale than usual  and that she was in a night dress  Fearful   that this change proceeded from what had passed between them the day   before  he asked with a hastiness  that shewed the most kind concern  if   she were well  No otherways disordered  answered she  than in my mind    and that not sufficiently to have any effect over my health  but to   confess the truth  monsieur  said she  the continual round of diversion   this carnival affords  has made what the world calls pleasure  cease to   be so with me  and I find more solid satisfaction in retirement  where I   am in no danger of being too much flattered or affronted       Ah  madam  cried he  I see the audacity of the count dwells too much   upon your thoughts  and tremble to relate the business on which I came    and which it is yet necessary you should know  You mistake me  monsieur    replied she  a common foe of virtue  such as the count  is incapable of   taking up my thoughts one moment  it is only those I love can give me   real pain       I understand you  madam  resumed he  and am too much interested in your   concern not to simpathize on the occasion  the misfortunes  such as I   fear will attend the too great sensibility of Melanthe  may give you so   terrible an idea of love in general  that it will be difficult to   persuade you there can be any lasting happiness to be found in that   passion   but  charming Louisa  continued he  if
