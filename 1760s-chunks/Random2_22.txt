me  and the old priest who recommended   58 him to my friendship  a young gentleman richly dressed  attended by a valet de chambre and two servants in livery  arrived at the inn  I thought I perceived a good deal of sweetness and good nature in his countenance  therefore  he had no sooner alighted than I accosted him  and in a few words explained my situation  He listened with great politeness  and when I had made an end of my story  said     Well  monsieur  what would you have me do    I was effectually abashed at this interrogation  which I believed no man of common sense or generosity could make  and made no other reply than a low bow  He returned the compliment still lower  and tript into an apartment  while the landlord let me know  that my standing there to interrupt company gave offence  and might do him infinite prejudice —He had no occasion to repeat his insinuation  I moved from the place immediately  and was so much transported with grief  anger  and disdain  that a torrent of blood gushed from my nostrils —In this extasy  I quitted Noyons  and betook myself to the fields  where I wandered about like one distracted  till my spirits were quite exhausted  and I was obliged to throw myself down at the root of a tree  to rest my wearied limbs —Here my rage forsook me  I began to feel the importunate cravings of nature  and relapsed into silent sorrow and melancholy reflection  I revolved all the crimes I had been guilty of  and found them so few and venial  that I could not comprehend the justice of that providence  which after having exposed me to so much wretchedness and danger  left me a prey to famine at last in a foreign country  where I had not one friend or acquaintance to close my eyes  and do the   59 last offices of humanity to my miserable carcase —A thousand times I wished myself a bear  that I might retreat to woods and desarts  far from the inhospitable haunts of man  where I could live by my own talents independant of treacherous friends  and supercilious scorn     As I lay in this manner  groaning over my hapless fate  I heard the sound of a violin  and raising my head  perceived a company of men and women dancing on the grass at some distance from me —I looked upon this to be a favourable season for distress to attract compassion  when every selfish thought is banished  and the heart dilated with mirth and social joy  wherefore I got up and approached those happy people  whom I soon discovered to be a party of soldiers  with their wives and children  unbending and diverting themselves at this rate  after the fatigue of a march —I had never before seen such a parcel of scare crows together  neither could I reconcile their meagre gaunt looks  their squalid and ragged attire  and every other external symptom of extreme woe  with this appearance of festivity —I saluted them however  and was received with great politesse  after which they formed a ring and danced around me —This jollity had a wonderful effect upon my spirits  I was infected with their gayety  and in spite of my dismal situation forgot my cares  and joined in their extravagance —When we had recreated ourselves a good while at this diversion  the ladies spread their manteaus on the ground  upon which they emptied their knapsacks of some onions  coarse bread  and and few flasks of poor wine  Being invited to a share of the banquet  I sat down with the rest  and in the whole course of my life never made a   60 more comfortable meal —When our repast was ended  we got up again to dance  and now that I found myself refreshed  I behaved to the admiration of every body  I was loaded with a thousand compliments  and professions of friendship  the men commended my person and agility  and the women were loud in the praise of my bonne grace —the serjeant in particular  expressed so much regard for me  and described the agreemens of a soldier s life  with so much art  that I began to listen to his proposal of enlisting me in the service  and the more I considered my own condition  the more I was convinced of the necessity I was under to come to a speedy determination —Having therefore maturely weighed the circumstances pro and con  I signified my consent  and was admitted into the regiment of Picardy  said to be the oldest corps in Europe —The company to which this command belonged  was quartered at a village not far off  whither we marched next day  and I was presented to my captain  who seemed very well pleased with my appearance  gave me a crown to drink  and ordered me to be accommodated with cloaths  arms and accoutrements —Whereupon I sold my livery suit  purchased linnen  and as I was at great pains to learn the exercise  in a very short time became a compleat soldier   It was not long before we received orders to join several more regiments  and march with all expedition into Germany  in order to reinforce Marechal Duc de Noailles  who was then encamped with his army on the side of
