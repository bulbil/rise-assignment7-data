shout  and foremost to propagate their unblushing faces upon brass  My uneasiness therefore at not finding my few favourite names among the number was now changed into congratulation    176 I could not avoid reflecting on the fine observation of Tacitus on a similar occasion  In this cavalcade of flattery  cries the historian  neither the pictures of Brutus  Cassius  nor Cato  were to be seen  eo clariores quia imagines eorum non deferebantur  their absence being the strongest proof of their merit   It is in vain  cried I  to seek for true greatness among these monuments of the unburied dead  let me go among the tombs of those who are confessedly famous  and see if any have been lately deposited there  who deserve the attention of posterity  and whose names may be transmitted to my distant friend  as an honour to the present age  Determined in my pursuit  I paid a second visit to Westminster Abbey  There I found several new monuments erected to the memory of several great men  the names of the great men I absolutely forget  but I well remember that Roubillac was the statuary who carved them  I could not help smiling at two modern epitaphs in particular  one of which praised the deceased for being ortus ex antiqua stirpe  the other commended the dead  because hanc aedem suis sumptibus reaedificavit  the greatest merit of one  consisted in his being descended from an illustrious house  the chief distinction of the other  that he had propped up an old house that was falling  Alas  alas  cried I  such monuments as these confer honour  not upon the great men  but upon little Roubillac   Hitherto disappointed in my enquiry after the great of the present age  I was resolved to mix in company  and try what I could learn among critics in coffee houses  and here it was that I heard my   177 favourite names talked of even with inverted fame  A gentleman of exalted merit  as a writer  was branded in general terms as a bad man  another of exquisite delicacy as a poet was reproached for wanting good nature  a third was accused of free thinking  and a fourth of having once been a player  Strange  cried I  how unjust are mankind in the distribution of fame  the ignorant among whom I sought at first  were willing to grant  but incapable of distinguishing the virtues of those which deserved it  among those I now converse with  they know the proper objects of admiration  but mix envy with applause   Disappointed so often  I was now resolved to examine those characters in person of whom the world talked so freely  by conversing with men of real merit I began to find out those characters which really deserved  though they strove to avoid  applause  I found the vulgar admiration entirely misplaced  and malevolence without its sting  The truly great  possessed of numerous small faults  and shining virtues  preserve a sublime in morals as in writing  They who have attained an excellence in either  commit numberless trangressions  observable to the meanest understanding  The ignorant critic and dull remarker can readily spy blemishes in eloquence or morals  whose sentiments are not sufficiently elevated to observe a beauty  but such are judges neither of books nor of life  they can diminish no solid reputation by their censure  nor bestow a lasting character by their applause  In short  I found by my search  that such only can confer real fame upon others  who have merit themselves to deserve it  Adieu     178  LETTER CVII  To the same   THERE are numberless employments in the courts of the Eastern Monarchs utterly unpractised and unknown in Europe  They have no such officers  for instance  as the Emperor s ear tickler  or tooth picker  they have never introduced at the courts the Mandarine appointed to bear the royal tobacco box  or the grave director of the imperial exercitations in the seraglio  Yet I am surprized that the English have imitated us in none of these particulars  as they are generally pleased with every thing that comes from China  and excessively fond of creating new and useless employments  They have filled their houses with our furniture  their public gardens with our fire works  and their very ponds with our fish  our courtiers  my friend  are the fish  and the furniture they should have imported  our courtiers would fill up the necessary ceremonies of a court better than those of Europe  would be contented with receiving large salaries for doing little  whereas some of this country are at present discontented though they receive large salaries for doing nothing   I lately  therefore  had thoughts of publishing a proposal here  for the admission of some new Eastern offices and titles into their court register  As I consider myself in the light of a Cosmopolite    179 I find as much satisfaction in scheming for the countries in which I happen to reside  as for that in which I was born   The finest apartments in the palace of Pegu are frequently infested with rats  These the religion of the country strictly forbids the people to kill  In such circumstances therefore they are obliged to have recourse to some great man of the court  who is willing to free the royal apartments
