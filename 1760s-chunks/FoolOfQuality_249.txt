of our weakness   he himself will be our   rectitude and guide from all error   he will purify our pollution     put his own robe on our nakedness   enrich our poverty with the   heartfelt treasures of himself  and we shall be as so many mirrors   wherein our divine Friend and Father shall delight to behold   the express image of his own person  his own perfections and   beatitudes  represented for ever      Oh  sir   exclaimed Harry  how you gladden  how you transport   me   I shall now no longer repine at my own weakness  or blindness    or ignorance  or insufficiency of any kind  since all these are   but as so many vessels prepared to contain pearls of infinite   price  even the riches  the enjoyment and fulness of my God    Never will I seek or desire  never will I accept any thing less   than himself      You must  my child  said Mr  Fenton   you are still in the flesh    in a carnal and propertied world   your old man must be fed  though   not pampered   it must be mortified  but not slain      You read in the third chapter of Genesis how our first father   lusted after the sensual fruits of this world   how he wilfully brake   the sole commandment of his God   how he added to his apostasy   the guilt of aspiring at independence   how he trusted to the   promise and virtue of creatures for making him equal in godhead   to the Creator   how in that day he died the fearfullest of all   deaths  a death to the fountain of life  light  and love within him     and how his eyes were opened to perceive the change of his body   into grossness  corruption  diseases  and mortality  conformable to   the world to which he had turned his faith  and into which he had   cast himself      Now  had man continued in this state  his spirit  which had turned   from God into its own creaturely emptiness  darkness  and desire    must have so continued for ever  in its own hell and misery    without the possibility of exciting or acquiring the smallest spark   of benevolence or virtue of any kind  But God  in compassion to   Adam  and more especially in compassion to his yet unsinning   progeny  infused into his undying essence a small embryo or   reconception of that lately forfeited image  which  in creation    had borne the perfect likeness of the Creator      From hence arises the only capacity of any goodness in man    And  according as we suppress  or quench  or encourage and foster    this heavenly seed  or infant offspring of God within us  in such   proportion we become either evil  malignant  and reprobate   or   benevolent  and replete with divine propensities and affections      Now  Harry  let us turn our eyes to our gross and outward man     for  as I told you  it must be cared for  and sustained agreeable to   its nature  and it is well deserving of our attention  forasmuch         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  263     as it is the husk  the habitation  and temple of that godlike   conception  which  when matured  is to break forth into never    ending glory      Lastly  this same outward man is further to be regarded by us    forasmuch as his infirmities  frailties  distemperatures  afflictions    aches  and anguishes are so intimately felt by his divine inmate    that they occasionally excite those thousand social charities  rela    tions  and endearments  that with links of golden love connect the   brotherhood of man      It is  therefore  worth while to inquire into the claims and rights   of this close  though gross companion   at least  so far as may be   requisite for his necessary  if not comfortable  subsistence upon   earth      We find that God has intrusted him with life  liberty  and   strength to acquire property for his sustenance  It is therefore   his duty to preserve all these trusts inviolate  for  as they are   wedded to his nature    what God hath so joined  let no man put   asunder       If these were not  my Harry  the natural  inheritable  and in    defeasible rights of all men  there would be no wrong  no injustice    in depriving all you should meet of their liberty  their lives  and   properties  at pleasure  For all laws that were ever framed for
