for for some time  by   one of those aspiring geniuses  who sacrifice the solid happiness of   independence to the vain ambition of being  Kell with the great    submitting to their capricious humours for the honour of a nod   in public places  or an invitation to their tables  to enhance their   welcome at which  and consume time they know not how to make   better use of  they fall upon this wise expedient of turning poet      When they had gone through all the formalities of polite address    and taken their seats with proper ceremony  the poet opened the   business        Well  sir    said he  with a smile of self complaisance    you   have perused that trifle   what is your opinion   Heh   don t you   think it will do           Sir    answered my master  with the smooth simper of a courtier      you do it injustice by calling it a trifle  The piece has a great deal   of merit  and reads very prettily in many places   but I fear it is   not quite so proper for the stage          How  sir   Not proper for the stage   Pray  sir  where does   the impropriety lie   Several persons of the first rank have read   it  and found no such thing  His grace said it abounded with the   vis comica   Lord Tastly was charmed with the Attic salt  and Sir   Peter Courtly admired the elegance of the diction  Pray  sir    where then can the impropriety lie   They are allowed to be good   judges          Pardon me  sir  I did not presume to call their judgment in   question in the least  But â€” a         And why  then  should you hesitate to receive it   They will   support it with all their interest          That  sir  I do not doubt  But â€” still  sir â€” the town          The town  sir   And pray  what of the town   Is the judg    ment of the town to be put in competition with theirs           No  sir  by no means  But still the town is a very formidable   and arbitrary judge  and will not admit its authority to be disputed   in such matters as this          And pray  good sir  what objections can the judicious town    or you  its learned advocate  make           Sir  you impose a very disagreeable task upon me   I had much   rather be excused          I do not in the least doubt that  sir  but my friends insist upon a   direct answer  Either receive the play  or say you will not          Sir  I should be very sorry to give offence to any gentleman     but since you insist upon my opinion  do not you think  sir  the   plot is too â€” too â€” too domestic   Aie not the intrigues and tricks   of servants too low a subject for polite entertainment           How  sir   Have you any objection to servants   Do not they   make a principal part in all our modem comedies   Are the Jeremy s   and Scrub s and Phillis s  and a thousand others to be rejected   because they are servants           No  sir  But consider they are not the principal characters    nor does the plot return upon them  They come in  as it were          380 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     by accident   and indeed  except in the instances you have men    tioned  and perhaps a very few more  they had much better be left   out  It shows a grossnesa of taste to stoop to them for enter    tainment          And do I not introduce the masters and mistresses too  as well   as the servants   Are there not country squires  and town fops   and fine ladies           Yes  sir  you do introduce them  but in a subordinate light    and merely to be the dupes of their servants  without any business   or importance of their own          And pray  sir  in what other light
