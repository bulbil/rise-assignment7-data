till night  The increase of your illness  from the time I received the last visit from Mr Faulkland  to such a degree as to alarm us for your life  I suppose  prevented your brother from reassuming the subject  though I can perceive he is full of anger and vexation on the occasion  You are now  my dear  God be praised  in a hopeful way of recovery  and I expect that George  who has  by espousing this man’s interests so warmly  very much offended me   that George  I say  will renew his sollicitations in his favour  What do you say  my child  I should be glad to know your thoughts  with regard to the part I have acted  as well as with respect to Mr Faulkland’s conduct   Shall I own my weakness to you  my dear Cecilia  I was ready to melt into tears  my spirits  exhausted by sickness  were not proof against this unexpected blow  a heavy sigh burst from my heart  that gave me a little relief  You know my mother is rigid in her notions of virtue  and I was determined to shew her that I would endeavour to imitate her  I therefore suppressed the swelling passion in my breast  and  with as much composure as I could assume  told her  I thought she acted as became her  and that  with regard to Mr Faulkland  my opinion of his conduct was such  that I never desired to see him more  This answer  dictated perhaps by female pride  for I will not answer for the feelings of my heart at that instant   was so agreeable to my mother  that she threw her arms about my neck  and kissed me several times  blessing  and calling me by the most endearing names at every interval  Her tenderness overcame me  or  to deal with sincerity  I believe I was willing to make it an excuse for weeping  Oh  my dear mother  cry’d I  I have need of your indulgence  but indeed your goodness quite overpowers me  My dear love  said she  you deserve it all  and more than it is in your mother’s power to shew you  What a blessed escape have you had  my sweet child  of that wild man  Little did I think  my Sidney  when I told you the story of my first disappointment  that a case so parallel would soon be your own     With respect to you and me indeed  the incidents are nearly alike  but there is a wide difference between the two men  My lover had the grace to repent  and would have returned to his first engagements  if a dreadful malady had not overtaken him  but this graceless Faulkland persists in his infidelity  and would make you as culpable as himself  I own to you  daughter  that the recollection of that melancholy event which happened to me  has given me a sort of horror at the very thoughts of a union between you and Mr Faulkland  You remember the sad consequences which I related to you of an infidelity of this kind  the poor forsaken woman died of grief  and the dishonest lover ran mad  Think of this  my child  and let it encourage you to banish such an unworthy man from your heart  I was afraid your regard for him might make this a difficult task  but I rejoice to find your virtue is stronger than your passion  I loved as well as you  but I overcame it when I found it a duty to do so  and I see your mother’s example is not lost upon you   The honest pride that my mother endeavoured to inspire me with  had a good effect  and kept up my spirits for a time  She told me  she was sure that Sir George would quarrel with us both  when we came to talk upon the subject of the marriage  but she was entirely easy as to that  now she knew that my sentiments corresponded with her own   You know my mother has ever been despotic in her government of me  and had I even been inclined to dissent from her judgment in a matter of this importance  it would have been to no purpose  but this was really far from my thoughts   I was as much disgusted with Mr Faulkland as she was  and as heartily pitied the unhappy young creature whom he had undone   You may recollect  my dear  that my mother  tho’ strictly nice in every particular  has a sort of partiality to her own sex  and where there is the least room for it  throws the whole of the blame upon the man’s side  who  from her own early prepossessions  she is always inclined to think are deceivers of women  I am not surprized at this bias in her  her early disappointment  with the attending circumstances  gave her this impression  She is warm  and sometimes sudden  in her attachments  and yet it is not always difficult to turn her from them  The integrity of her own heart makes her liable to be imposed on by a plausible outside  and yet the dear good woman takes a sort of pride in her sagacity  She had admired and esteemed
