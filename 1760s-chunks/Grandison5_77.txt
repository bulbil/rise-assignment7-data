it  my dear—  While the Florentine is there—  I never  madam  can be any thing but a wellwisher to the Florentine—  God give you  Sir  and me too  ease of mind  But I find my head overstrained  It is bound round as with a cord  I think  putting her hands to each side Page  192 of it  for a moment—You must leave me  Sir  But if you will see me to morrow morning  and tell me whither you intend to go  and what you intend to do  I shall be obliged to you  Cannot we talk together  Sir  as brother and sister  Or as tutor and pupil —Those were happy days  Let us try to recover them   She put her hand to her forehead  as apprehensive of disorder  and looked discomposed  I bowed to both Ladies  in silence  retired  and  without endeavouring to see any body else  went to my lodgings   LETTER XXIX  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  In Continuation   Bologna  Thursday  July 13 24   I Had a visit early this morning from the Count of Belvedere  Be found me very much indisposed  He had heard that I had met with some difficulties  and attributed my indisposition to them   I owned that it might be so  My life  my Lord  said I  has not been so happy as might have been hoped for  by a man  who has made it his study to avoid giving offence  either to man or woman  and has endeavoured to restrain passions  that otherwise might have been as unruly as those of other young men  in my circumstances  But  I bless God  I have resolution  I may bend beneath a weight  when it is first laid upon me  But if I find I cannot shake it off  I will endeavour to collect my strength  and make myself easy under it  Pardon me  my Lord  I do not often allow my mind to break out thus into words  But I hold the Count of Belvedere for my friend   You do me honour  said he  And I came with a heart disposed to cultivate your friendship  I thank you for your last goodness to me  Your advice and gentle behaviour  when I was not fit to be trusted with myself  have saved me  as far as I know  from Page  193 final destruction  To the last day of my life  I shall confess obligation to you  But  dear Chevalier  if some account of the difficulties you meet with will not be a renewal of grief  now you are not very well—  It will not be so  my Lord  interrupted I  since at present I can think of nothing else  Yet putting myself in the place of every one of the family of Porretta  I have nobody to blame  but the contrary  And I must admire Lady Clementina as one of the noblest of women   He was all impatience for further particulars   What may yet be the event  I cannot tell  proceeded I  Therefore will only say  that difference in religion is the difficulty with the Lady  I am willing to allow her the full and free exercise of hers  She insists upon a change of mine  For the rest  you  my Lord  want not friends among the principals of the family  let them give you what account they think fit  I would not scruple to gratify your curiosity  could I give you a conclusive one   I am curious  Chevalier  said he  I loved Clementina above all women  before her illness  I loved her not the less for her illness  for then my Pity joined with my Love  and added a tenderness to it  of which I had not  in equal degree  been before sensible  The treatment she met with  and the self interested cruelty of Lady Laurana  heightened her illness  and that  I did not think it possible  my Love  In order to free her from that treatment  and in hopes that a different one  my hopes you see were not ill founded  would restore her reason  and that the happy result might be the defeating of the cruel Laurana s expectations  I tender d myself in marriage to her  notwithstanding her illness  But I must say  that I never knew how much I loved her  till I was apprehensive that  not only I  but Italy  and her Religion  were likely to lose her for ever  And will you not allow of my curiosity now  God give you  Chevalier  health Page  194 and happiness here and hereafter  But may you never be the husband of Clementina  but of some woman of your own country  if there be one in it that can deserve you   The Count left me with this wish  pronounced with earnestness  And I suppose will visit the Bishop and Father Marescotti  in order to gratify his curiosity   My indisposition requiring indulgence  I sent a billet to the Marchioness  excusing my attendance till the afternoon  on the score of an unexpected engagement  I was loth to mention that I was not very well  lest
