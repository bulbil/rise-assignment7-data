had returned to acquaint him   that the Countess had given her hand to Raymond  and that his nuptials  had been solemnized on the very day of their approach     The bitterness of this intelligence was too great even for the great  soul of WILLIAM  He sunk into a silent dismay  and seemed unwilling or  unable to contend with despair  The Knight  whose suspecting thoughts  had been prepared for this account  strove to rouse and comfort him  but  a long time were his efforts fruitless  The afflicted Lord scarcely  forced out  at long and heavy intervals  some broken sighs  some  confused and imperfect expressions  of anguish  of resentment  at the  supposed unkindness of his wife  and the weakness and unworthiness of  her fatal compliance  At length  suddenly starting from this extreme of  depression to that of the most violent fury  he uttered dreadful  denunciations of vengeance against the destroyer of his peace  and  called on his friends to attend him instantly to his castle  and to  assist him in a brave and jost revenge  But here the caution of the  old  Knight interposed  and with difficulty prevailed on him to return to his  friendly roof  and there to consult maturely upon the most prudent  measures  The Earl obeyed  yet seemed intent only on the most violent  and daring course  In vain did Randolph remind him of the insufficient  numbers of his retinue  and the superior advantages of the usurper  The  storm of passion was still loud and terrible  nor could the Earl  liften to danger or difficulty  the injuries which his honour had  sustained were the sole object of his thoughts  and revenge his sole  purpose     The fair Jacqueline soon perceived a confusion and disorder arising from  some unexpected incident  and  impatient to learn the cause  appeared  before her host and her protector  Randolph accosted and entreated her  to unite her gentle persuasion  and to prevent Lord William from rushing  precipitately on ruin   No   cried the Earl  hastily interrupting him         the attempt is not rash  nor the purpose desperate  What tho  my wife  hath so soon forgotten me  What tho  the absence of a few months was  too great for her impatience  What tho  she hath accepted a second  husband  Have my numerous dependents too been false  Have they forgotten  me  No  let us collect them  let us fire their brave spirits to revenge  their injured Lord  and let his fury fall with its due force upon this  adulterous pair         —Jacqueline seemed lost in consusion  Randolph again interposed  and  urged the danger of venturing  thus weakly attended  to seek his  vassals  and openly to give defiance to Raymond  But now the noble maid  recovered from her first furprise  and her great soul began to beam  forth thro  all her virgin reserve       Where is that power and influence  said she  in the court of England   which Lord William boasted  If his own wrongs cannot there find redress   if he must have recourse to the precarious chance of arms  in vain have  I sought relief in this strange land  in vain have I indulged the  pleasing hopes of regaining my lost inheritance  and  if he still  supports the miseries of oppression  my injured parent  Will not the  king protect — He  shall give me justice  cried William             This arm raised him to the throne  this arm can tear him from it         Then embracing her with a paternal sondness   The spirit of thy brave  father   said he       dwells in thee  Yes  fair partner of my fortunes  the King shall give me  justice  Let my wife  no  the wife of Raymond now  enjoy for a while her  foul disloyalty  My vengeance shall be first directed a gainst the great  author of my wrongs  the proud Hubert  In the face of his misguided  Sovereign  before the gallant Nobles of England  will I proclaim his  baseness  and demand full redress  Let us hasten to the royal presence   there shall my friends croud round me  and my vassals attend my orders         Randolph was pleased at this resolution  which William considered as the  most honourable  but he as the safest course  The time  the manner  and  all the circumstances of their departure were now settled with more  temper and composed deliberation  The Knight insisted to accompany his  noble friend  together with his band of followers  Jacqueline  consented still to reside in Cornwall  until the Earl had obtained   first  the sull redress of his own injuries  and  then  the happy means  of rescuing her father  or of revenging his fate  The little troop was  soon prepared to enter on their march  and soon took
