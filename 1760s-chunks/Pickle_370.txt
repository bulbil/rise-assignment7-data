moreover a  most wretched slave    Notwithstanding these concurring circumstances in favour of the  usurper  he did not think himself secure while the orphan had any chance  of finding a friend who would undertake his cause  and therefore laid    6 22 15  3 45 PM   a plan for his being kidnapped  and sent to America as a slave  His  coadjutor in this inhuman scheme was a person who carried on the trade  of transporting servants to our plantations  and was deeply interested  on this occasion  having  for a mere trifle  purchased of the late  Lord A    the reversion of a considerable part of the A   estate  which  shameful bargain was confirmed by the brother  but could never take  place  unless the boy could be effectually removed    Everything being settled with this auxiliary  several ruffians were  employed in search of the unhappy victim  and the first attempt that was  made upon him  in which his uncle personally assisted  happening near  one of the great markets of the city of Dublin  an honest butcher  with  the assistance of his neighbours  rescued him by force from their cruel  hands  This  however  was but a short respite  for  though warned by  this adventure  the boy seldom crept out of his lurking places  without  the most cautious circumspection  he was  in March  1727  discovered  by the diligence of his persecutors  and forcibly dragged on board of  a ship bound for Newcastle  on Delaware river in America  where he  was sold as a slave  and kept to hard labour  much above his age  or strength  for the space of thirteen years  during which he was  transferred from one person to another    While he remained in this servile situation  he often mentioned   to those in whom he thought such confidence might be placed  the  circumstances of his birth and title  together with the manner of his  being exiled from his native country  although  in this particular  he  neglected a caution which he had received in his passage  importing that  such a discovery would cost him his life  Meanwhile the usurper quietly  enjoyed his right  and to those who questioned him about his brother s  son  constantly replied  that the boy had been dead for several years   And Arthur  earl of A    dying in April 1737  he  upon pretence of being  next heir  succeeded to the honours and estate of that nobleman    The term of the nephew s bondage  which had been lengthened out beyond  the usual time  on account of his repeated attempts to escape  being  expired in the year 1739  he hired himself as a common sailor in a  trading vessel bound to Jamaica  and there  being entered on board of  one of his majesty s ships under the command of Admiral Vernon  openly  declared his parentage and pretensions  This extraordinary claim  which  made a great noise in the fleet  reaching the ears of one Lieutenant  S    nearly related to the usurper s Irish wife  he believed the young  gentleman to be an impostor  and  thinking it was incumbent on him to  discover the cheat  he went on board the ship to which the claimant  belonged  and  having heard the account which he gave of himself  was   notwithstanding his prepossessions  convinced of the truth of what  he alleged  On his return to his own ship  he chanced to mention this  extraordinary affair upon the quarter deck  in the hearing of Mr  B     one of the midshipmen  who had formerly been at school with Mr  A     This young gentleman not only told the lieutenant  that he had been  school fellow with Lord A   s son  but also declared that he should know  him again  if not greatly altered  as he still retained a perfect idea  of his countenance    Upon this intimation  the lieutenant proposed that the experiment  should be tried  and went with the midshipman on board the ship that  the claimant was on  for that purpose  After all the sailors had been  assembled upon deck  Mr  B    casting his eyes around  immediately    6 22 15  3 45 PM   distinguished Mr  A   in the crowd  and  laying his hand on his  shoulder   This is the man   said he  affirming  at the same time  that   while he continued at school with him  the claimant was reputed and  respected as Lord A   s son and heir  and maintained in all respects  suitable to the dignity of his rank  Nay  he was  in like manner   recognised by several other persons in the fleet  who had known him in  his infancy    These things being reported to the admiral  he generously ordered him  to be supplied with necessaries  and treated like a gentleman  and  in  his next
