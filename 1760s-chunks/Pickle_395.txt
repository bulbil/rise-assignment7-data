the self denial of your forlorn   P  Pickle     Emilia  who knew the nicety of our hero s pride  had foreseen the  purport of this epistle before it came to her hands  she did not   therefore  despair of success  nor desist from the prosecution of her  plan  which was no other than that of securing her own happiness  in  espousing the man upon whom she had fixed her unalterable affection   Confident of his honour  and fully satisfied of the mutual passion with  which they were inspired  she gradually decoyed him into a literary  correspondence  wherein she attempted to refute the arguments on which  he grounded his refusal  and  without doubt  the young gentleman was not  a little pleased with the enjoyment of such delightful commerce  in the  course of which he had  more than ever  an opportunity of admiring the  poignancy of her wit  and the elegance of her understanding   The contemplation of such excellency  while it strengthened the chains  with which she held him enslaved  added emulation to the other motives  that induced him to maintain the dispute  and much subtlety of reasoning  was expended upon both sides of this very particular question  without  any prospect of conviction on either part  till  at last  she began to  despair of making him a proselyte to her opinion by dint of argument   and resolved for the future to apply herself chiefly to the irresistible  prepossessions of his love  which were not at all diminished or impaired  by the essays of her pen  With this view she proposed a conference   pretending that it was impossible to convey all her reflections upon  this subject in a series of short letters  and Godfrey undertook to bail  him for the day  But  conscious of her power  he would not trust himself    6 22 15  3 45 PM   in her presence  though his heart throbbed with all the eagerness of  desire to see her fair eyes disrobed of that resentment which they  had worn so long  and to enjoy the ravishing sweets of a fond  reconciliation   Nature could not have held out against such powerful attacks  had not  the pride and caprice of his disposition been gratified to the full in  the triumph of his resistance  he looked upon the contest as altogether  original  and persevered with obstinacy  because he thought himself  sure of favourable terms  whenever he should be disposed to  capitulate  Perhaps he might have overshot himself in the course of his  perseverance  A young lady of Emilia s fortune and attractions could  not fail to find herself surrounded by temptations  which few women can  resist  She might have misinterpreted the meaning of some paragraph or  taken umbrage at an unguarded expression in one of Peregrine s letters   She might have been tired out by his obstinate peculiarity  or  at the  long run  construed it into madness  slight  or indifference  or  rather  than waste her prime in fruitless endeavours to subdue the pride of  a headstrong humourist  she might have listened to the voice of some  admirer  fraught with qualifications sufficient to engage her esteem and  affection  But all these possibilities were providentially prevented by  an accident attended with more important consequences than any we have  hitherto recounted   Early one morning Pipes was disturbed by the arrival of a messenger  who  had been sent express from the country by Mr  Clover  with a packet for  the lieutenant  and arrived in town overnight  but as he was obliged to  have recourse to the information of Jack s correspondent in the city   touching the place of his abode  before he demanded entrance at the  Fleet the gate was shut  nor would the turnkeys admit him  although he  told them that he was charged with a message of the utmost consequence   so that he was fain to tarry till daybreak  when he  at his earnest  solicitation  was allowed to enter   Hatchway  opening the packet  found a letter enclosed for Peregrine   with an earnest request that he should forward it to the hands of that  young gentleman with all possible despatch  Jack  who could not dive  into the meaning of this extraordinary injunction  began to imagine  that Mrs  Clover lay at the point of death  and wanted to take a last  farewell of her brother  and this conceit worked so strongly upon his  imagination  that  while he huddled on his clothes  and made the best of  his way to the apartment of our hero  he could not help cursing  within  himself  the folly of the husband in sending such disagreeable messages  to a man of Peregrine s impatient temper  already soured by his own  uneasy situation  This reflection would have induced him to suppress the  letter  had not he been afraid to tamper with the ticklish disposition  of his friend  to whom  while he delivered it   As for my own part    said he   mayhap I may have as much natural affection as another  but  when my spouse parted
