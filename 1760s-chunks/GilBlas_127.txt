Enriquez  who gained the ascendancy over all his enemies  As for Siffredi  the melancholy he contracted from having been the cause of destruction to his dearest friends  gave him a disgust to the world  and made a longer abode in his native country insupportable  He turned his back on Sicily for ever  and  coming over into Spain with Portia  his surviving daughter  purchased this mansion  He lived here nearly fifteen years after the death of Blanche  and had the consolation  before his own death  of establishing Portia in the world  She married Don Jerome de Silva  and I am the only issue of that marriage  Such  pursued the widow of Don Pedro de Penares  is the story of my family  a faithful recital of the melancholy events represented in that picture  which was painted by order of my grandfather Leontio  as a record to his posterity of the fatal adventure I have related       CH  V     The behaviour of Aurora de Guzman on her arrival at Salamanca   ORTIZ  her companions  and myself  after having heard this tale  withdrew together from the hall  where we left Aurora with Elvira  There they lengthened out the remainder of the day in a mutual intercourse of confidence  They were not likely to be weary of each other  and on the following morning  when we took our leave  there was as much to do to part them  as if they had been two friends brought up in the closest habits of confidence and affection   In due time we reached Salamanca without any impediment  There we immediately engaged a ready furnished house  and Dame Ortiz  as it had been before agreed  assumed the name of Donna Kimena de Guzman  She had played the part of a duenna too long not to be able to shift her character according to circumstances  One morning she went out with Aurora  a waiting maid and a man  servant  and betook herself to a lodging house  where we had been informed that Pacheco most commonly took up his abode  She asked if there was any lodging to be let there  The answer was in the affirmative  and they showed her into a room in very neat condition  which she hired  She paid down earnest to the landlady  telling her that it was for one of her nephews who  was coming from Toledo to finish his studies at Salamanca  and might be expected on that very day   The duenna and my mistress  after having made sure of this apartment  went back the way they came  and the lovely Aurora  without loss of time  metamorphosed herself into a spruce young spark  She concealed her black ringlets under a braid of light  coloured hair  the better to disguise herself          manufactured her eyebrows to correspond  and dressed herself up in such a costume  as to look for all the world as if her sex were of a piece with her appearance  Her deportment was free and easy  so that  with the exception of her face  which was somewhat more delicate than became the manly character  there was nothing to lead to a discovery of her masquerading  The waiting woman who was to officiate as page  got into her paraphernalia at the same time  and we had no apprehension respecting her competency to perform her part  There was no danger of her beauty telling any tales  and besides  she could put on as brazen faced a swagger as the most impudent dog in town  After dinner  our two actresses  finding themselves in cue to make their first appearance on the stage  where the scene was laid in the ready furnished lodging  took me along with them  We all three placed ourselves in the coach  and carried with us all the baggage we were likely to have occasion for   The landlady  Bernarda Ramirez by name  welcomed us with a glut of civility  and led the way to our room  where we began to make arrangements with her  We concluded a bargain for our board by the month  which she undertook should be suitable to our condition  Then we asked if she had her complement of boarders  I have none at all at present  answered she  Not that there would be any want of enough  if I was of the mind to take in all sorts of people  but young men of fashion are the thing for me  I expect one of that description this morning  he is coming hither from Madrid to complete his education  Don Lewis Pacheco  But you must have heard of him before now  No  said Aurora  I have no acquaintance whatever with the gentleman  and since we are to be inmates together  you will do me a kindness by letting me a little into his character  Please your honour  replied the landlady  leering at this outside of a man  his figure is as taking as your own  just the same sort of make  and about the same size  Oh  how well you will do together  By St James  though I say it who should not say it  I shall have about me two of the prettiest young fellows in all Spain  Well  but
