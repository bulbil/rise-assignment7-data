heard  that Sir Hargrave Pollexfen was at his house on the forest  he rode to make him a visit  tho  some few miles out of his way  I attended him   Sir Hargrave is one of the most miserable of men  He is not yet fully recovered of the bruises and rough treatment he met with near Paris  But he is so miserably sunk in his spirits  that my patron could not but be concerned for him  He received him with grateful acknowlegements  and was thankful for his visit  Page  289 But he told him  that he was so miserable in himself  that he could hardly thank him for saving a life so wretched   Mr  Merceda  it seems  died about a sortnight ago   That poor man was thought to be pretty well recovered  and rode out several times  But was taken on his return from one of his rides  with a vomiting of blood  the consequence  as imagined  of some inward bruises  and died miserably  His death  and the manner of it  have greatly affected Sir Hargrave —And poor Bagenhall  Sir Charles  said he  is as miserable a dog as I am   Sir Hargrave  understanding  as he said  that I was a parson  begged me to give him one prayer—  He was so importunate  and for Sir Charles to join in it  that we both kneeled with him   Sir Hargrave wept  He called himself a hardened dog   Strange man —But I think I was still more affected  Sir Hargrave shocked me   by your noble brother s humanity  than by Sir Hargrave s wretchedness  tears of compassion for the poor man  stealing down his manly cheek—God comfort you  Sir Hargrave  said he  wringing his hand—Dr  Bartlett is a good man  You shall have the prayers of us both   He left him  He could stay no longer  followed by the unhappy man s blessings  interrupted by violent sobbings   We were both so moved  that we broke not silence  as we rode  till we joined our company at my Lord s   I recounted what passed at this interview to Mr  Grandison  Your Ladyship will not want me to be very particular in relating what were his applications Page  290 to  and reflexions on  himself  when I tell you that he could not have been more concerned  had he been present on the occasion   Mr  Beauchamp was with us when I gave this relation to Mr  Grandison  He was affected at it  and with Mr  Grandison s sensibility  But how happy for himself was it  that his concern had in it no mixture of self reproach  It was a generous and humane concern  like that of his dear friend   Sir Charles s next visit was to the good Earl of G  And here we left my Lord G   the best natured  and one of the most virtuous and prudent young noblemen in the Kingdom  Your Ladyship will not accuse me of flattery  when you read this  but you will  perhaps  of another view—Yet  as long as I know that you love to have justice done to my Lord  and in your heart are sensible of the truth of what I say  and I am sure rejoice in it  I give chearful way to the justice  and the rather  as you look upon my Lord as so much yourself  that if you receive his praises with some little reluctance  it is with such a modest reluctance as you would receive your own  glad  at the same time  that you were so justly complimented   My Lord will acquaint your Ladyship with all that passed at the good Earl s  and how much overjoyed he and Lady Gertrude were at the favour they thought your brother did them in dining with them  His Lordship will tell you also  how much they wish for you  for they propose to winter there  and not in Hertfordshire  as once they thought to do   Here Sir Charles enquired after their neighbour  Mr  Bagenhall   He is become a very melancholy man  His wife is as obliging as he will let her be  but he hates her  and the less wonder  for he hates himself   Page  291 Poor woman  she could not expect a better fate  To yield up her chastity  to be forced upon him afterwards  by way of doing her poor justice  what affiance can he have in her virtue  were she to meet with a trial   But that is not all  for though nobody questions her fidelity  yet what weight with him can her arguments have  were she to endeavour to enforce upon his mind those doctrines  which  were they to have proceeded from a pure heart  might  now and then  have let in a ray of light on his benighted soul  A gloomy mind must occasionally receive great consolation from the interposal and soothing of a companionable Love  when we know it comes from an untainted heart   Poor Mr  Grandison found in this case also great room for self application and regret  without my being so officious as to remind him of the similitude  tho
