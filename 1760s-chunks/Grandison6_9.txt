you  my Harriet  had given me of that amiable man  I was surprised  But  contrary to the manner of ghosts  it spoke first—Venerable Lady  it called me  and said  its name was Grandison  in a voice—so like what I had heard you spake of it  that I had no doubt but it was Sir Charles Grandison himself  and was ready to fall down to welcome him      It took its place by me  You  madam  said it  will forgive this intrusion  And it made several fine speeches  with an air so modest  so manly—It had almost all the talk to itself  I could only bow  and   22 be pleased  for still I thought it was corporally  and indeed  Sir Charles Grandison  It said  that it had but a very little while to stay  It must reach  I don t know what place  that night—What  said I  will you not go to Selby house  Will you not see my daughter Byron  Will you not see her aunt Selby  No  it desired to be excused  It talked of leaving a pacquet behind it  and seemed to pull out of its pocket a parcel of Letters sealed up  It broke the seal  and laid the parcel on the table before me  It refused refreshment  It desired in a courtly manner  an answer to what it had discoursed upon—Made a profound reverence—and—vanished    And now  my dear Lady G  let me repeat my question  What is become of your brother   Forgive me  this light  this amusing manner  My grandmamma speaks of this visit as an appearance  so sudden  and so short  and nobody seeing him but she  that it gave a kind of amusing levity to my pen  and I could not resist the temptation I was under to surprise you  as he has done us all  How could he take such a journey  see nobody but my grandmamma  and fly the country  Did he do it to spare us  or to spare himself   The direct truth is this  My grandmamma was sitting by herself  as above  James told her  as above  that a gentleman desired to be introduced to her  He was introduced  He called himself by his own name  took her hand  saluted her—Your character  madam  and mine  said he  are so well known to each other  that tho  I never before had the honour of approaching you  I may presume upon your pardon for this intrusion   He then launched out in the praises of your happy friend  With what delight did the dear  the indulgent parent repeat them from his mouth  I hope she mingled not her own partialities with them  whether I deserved them  or not  for sweet is praise  from   23 those we wish to love us  And then he said  You see before you  madam  a man glorying in his affection to one of the most excellent of your Sex  an Italian Lady  the pride of Italy  And who  from motives which cannot be withstood  has rejected him  at the very time that all her friends consenting  and innumerable difficulties overcome  he expected that she would yield her hand to his wishes—And they were his wishes  My friendship for the dear Miss Byron  You and she must authorize me to call it by a still dearer name  before I dare to it  is well known  That also has been my pride  I know too well what belongs to female delicacy in general  and particularly to that of Miss Byron  to address myself first to her  on the subject which occasions you this trouble  I am not accustomed to make professions  not even to Ladies—Is it consistent with your notions of delicacy  madam  Will it be with Mr  and Mrs  Selby s  to give your interest in favour of a man who is thus situated  A rejected man  A man who dares  to own  that the rejection was a disappointment to him  and that he tenderly loved the fair rejecter  If it will  and Miss Byron can accept the tender of a heart that has been divided  unaccountably so  the circumstances  I presume  you know  then will you  then will she  lay me under an obligation that I can only endeavour to repay by the utmost gratitude and affection —But if not  I shall admire the delicacy of the second refuser  as I do the piety of the first  and  at least  suspend all thoughts of a change of condition   Noblest of men—And my grandmamma was proceeding in high strains  but very sincere ones  when  interrupting her  and pulling out of his pocket the pacquet I mentioned above  I presume  madam  said he  that I see favour and goodness to me in your benign countenance  But I will not even be favoured  but upon your full knowledge of all the facts I am master of myself  I will be the guardian of the delicacy   24 of Miss Byron and all her friends in this important case  rather than the discourager  tho  I were to suffer by it  You
