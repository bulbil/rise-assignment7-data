it must be his own care prudently and  secretly to dispose of young William  Nor did Raymond  in his present  temper  hear him with abhorrence or emotion  To such inconsistencies is  the mind of man hurried by the tyranny of passions  He had just  expressed the tenderest pity for the Countess  and now  when the  determined villain had proposed to destroy her infant son  he started  not at the horrid council  nor refused his consent                  SECT  II     BUT that pity which pride and interested cruelty denied her  Ela found  now in her own sex  Her principal female attendant  though the creature  of Raymond  and by him appointed for her service  had long beheld her  sorrows and maternal fondness  with secret grief and sympathy  She had   herself  been wife and mother  had long felt and known their endearments  and cares  Long had she wept in secret for  the afflictions of her injured lady  and now attended on her sick  couch  with all the fond zeal and concern  which a woman s distress  could excite in the gentle and feeling mind of woman  Her affection was  now undissembled  for her Lord enjoined the most assiduous care  when  the disorder had first seized the Countess   and that affection was  attended with success  proportioned to it s ardor and sincerity  Not  time nor fatigue could abate her diligence and kind attention to a  beloved mistress  who long lay insensible of her goodness  shrinking  timorously from the hand that presented relief  At length  however   nature appeared still unconquered in this severe conflict  Reason began  gradually to regain it s native seat  and the Countess was restored to  some composure  Elinor  so was her attendant called  watched the happy  moment  when she began to survey the objects round her without  distraction  to offer comfort and consolation  She presented her son   who stood weeping by her side  to assure her of his security  and every  office which duty and charity could dictate  she busily performed to  allay the violence of her malady  and to restore her languid spirit  The  Countess  touched with her goodness  repaid her with the warmest  expressions of regard and gratitude  Their affection was now mutual   and was succeeded by mutual considence  Thus  even amongst it s  enemies  did oppressed virtue so far prevail  as to reconcile one mind   and to attach one relenting heart  to it s injured cause  Ela every hour  experienced the happy effects of tender care  She had recovered some  degree of ease and strength  she had leisure to reflect upon her danger  and difficulties  misfortune and solitude had effaced the proud thoughts  of rank and greatness  and without reserve she opened her soul to this  attendant  bitterly lamenting the severity of her fate  who  tho  she  numbered many and powerful friends  tho  her fortune and condition gave  her the command of a formidable band of vassals  yet by foul treachery  was cut off from all relief  from all possibility of complaining  or  petitioning for deliverance  subjected to the will of  insolent and cruel enemies  and exposed to all the distresses of  captivity  in that very place  where she was rightful mistress  strange  reward for the services of her great father  and her noble husband  The  attendant with ardent prayers  and lively effusions of pity and  tenderness  gave her some slight consolation  but tho  she felt for her  distress  she seemed incapable of devising any reasonable means of  relief  Hope  patience  and such like terms  which found but harshly in  the ear of affliction  she repeated with a warm but impotent zeal  she  even ventured to hint at the expediency of assuming an appearance of  less severity to Lord Raymond  of flattering his fond expectations for a  while  thus  to amuse the busy and contriving malice of his creature  to  gain some interval of ease  some happy respite from persecution  Time  and the interposition of heaven might then work wonderfully for her  deliverance  But the soul of Ela still retained a dignity superior to  the arts of dissimulation  She started with abhorrence  at the thought  of sullying her bright same by any suspicious conduct  any semblance of  unworthy condescension  Her high mind dwelt with more pleasure on the  flattering thoughts of redress and vengeance  She reflected that the  land still contained many powerful friends to her lost husband  and to  her noble house  she hoped that nothing was necessary for her  deliverance  and for the punishment of her oppressors  but to inform  them of her dangerous and distressful state  Possessed with these  thoughts  she conceived the bold design of eluding the vigilance of  Raymond  and of escaping to a religious house  there to take sanctuary  with her infant son  from thence to represent to the King  the cruel  insult offered to the memory of his kinsman and
