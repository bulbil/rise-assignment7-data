the scenes  and the concerns of   individuals were overwhelmed and lost in the confusion of nations          CHAPTER XIV     CHRYSAl s remarks on military glory in her journey â€” TWO   STRANGE PASSENGERS TAKEN INTO THE BOAT â€” NATIONAL PREJU    DICE AND PRIDE BREAK OTTT IN PERSONS NOT LIKELY TO BE   SirSPBCTBD OF SUCH PASSIONS     While I was travelling to my destined master  I had frequent   opportunities of seeing the fruits of military glory in the misery of   the people  and desolation of the countries through which I went    Such scenes as these cannot be made known by description to an   inhabitant of this happy island  whose situation defends it from the   sudden inroads of foreign enemies  as its natural naval strength does   from the more deliberate devastations of regular invasion  and the   excellency of its laws  from the yet severer outrages of arbitrary   power  But  amid all this unhappiness  such is the insatiate in    gratitude of the human heart that  not content with these blessings    you are ever complaining  ever grasping at more  till  in the end    you lose the enjoyment of what you possess  insensible that your       Frederick of Prussia was reueiving an annual subsidy of Â£670 000   and the Landgrave of Hesse one of Â£340 000 for the hire of troops         212 ADVENTUBES OF A GUINEA     ABTerest wants would be abundance to millions  who dare not even   utter a complaint      It has been said that there is a certain degree of madness requisite   to make a great man   that is  to enable humanity to conquer its   first principle of self preservation  to slight the most terrifying   dangers  and to seek the most severe evils that interrupt its pursuit of   an imaginary good  The lust of power and the intoxication of   glory may seem to animate the great to this contradiction of nature    but madness alone can support the mass of mankind through it   who are insensible to these fantastic motives  or  at least  cannot   delude themselves with the fairest hope of ever obtaining them    Of this I saw many instances in my journey through the countries   that were the scene of the present war   but one more particularly   that happened in one of the Dutch travelling boats  early in our   journey  made the strongest impression on me  and deserves relation   most  There had been an obstinate battle fought some time before   between the parties then at war  in which the loss was so severe    and so equal on both sides  that  as soon as night covered their   retreat  each withdrew  concluding itself vanquished  though next   morning  when they came to a better knowledge of each other s   situation  they both claimed the victory  while neither thought   proper to return to the charge to assert that claim        This uncertainty aggravated the misery of the unhappy wretches    who were left wounded on the field of battle  as it prevented their   receiving relief either from friend or enemy  However  as thi    dreadful scene was acted in the neighbourhood of a neutral city    as soon as the iirst terrors of it were a little cooled  the common   feelings of humanity moved some of the inhabitants to go and try   to relieve as many of the deserted sufferers as had not perished for   want of more timely assistance  without distinction or respect to   any party      Two of those victims of ambition  who had been enemies   in the day of battle  but had since founded a friendship on   their common calamity having been supported by the same   charity  and cured of their wounds in the same bed  were now   striving to get the mangled remains of their mutilated carcasses   carried  like other worn out instruments of the war  to their re    spective countries  In their journey they happened to be brought   to the waterside  where we had just taken boat  where they begged   in the most moving terms to be admitted  but were absolutely   refused  till one of the passengers  an English gentleman  took   compassion on their distress  and paid their fare      We were all seated in the equality usual in such vehicles  in which    as in a grave  all conditions are thrown promiscuously together    when  the conversation happening to turn upon the war  whicli   then reigned in most parts of Europe  and every one speaking   variously  as prejudice or opinion dictated  the Englishman chanced     1 At Lobositz  the victorious Prussians were said to have lost more   in killed and wounded than the enemy
