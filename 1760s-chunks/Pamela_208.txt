 Monday  I myself  said he  well remember  it was that I wrote you the   letter  that prevailed on you so kindly to return to me  and on the same   day you did return to my house here  which I hope  my girl  will be as   propitious an era as any you have named  And now  lastly  will you say    which will crown the work  And  on a Monday I was married   Come  come    my dear  added he  Thursday has reigned long enough o conscience  let us   now set Monday in its place  or at least on an equality with it  since   you see it has a very good title  and as we now stand in the week before   us  claims priority  And then  I hope  we shall make Tuesday  Wednesday    Friday  Saturday  and Sunday  as happy days as Monday and Thursday  and   so  by God s blessing  move round  as the days move  in a delightful   circle  till we are at a loss what day to prefer to the rest       O how charmingly was this said   And how sweetly kind       Indeed  sir  said I  you rally my folly very agreeably  but don t let a   little matter stand in the way  when you are so generously obliging in a   greater  Indeed I like Thursday best  if I may choose       Well  then  said he  if you can say you have a better reason than this    I will oblige you  else I ll send away for the parson this moment       And so  I protest  he was going   Dear sirs  how I trembled  Stay  stay    sir  said I  we have a great deal to say first  I have a deal of silly   prate to trouble you with   Well  say then  in a minute  replied he  the   most material  for all we have to say may be talked of while the   parson is coming   O  but indeed  and indeed  said I  it cannot be   to day   Well  then  shall it be to morrow  said he   Why  sir  if it   must not be on a Thursday  you have given so many pleasant distinctions   for a Monday  that let it then be next Monday   What  a week still  said   he  Sir  answered I  if you please  for that will be  as you enjoined    within the second seven days  Why  girl  said he   twill be seven months   till next Monday  Let it  said he  if not to morrow  be on Wednesday  I   protest I will stay no longer       Then  sir  returned I  please to defer it  however  for one day more    and it will be my beloved Thursday  If I consent to defer it till then    may I hope  my Pamela  said he  that next Thursday shall certainly be   the happy day   Yes  sir  said I and I am sure I looked very foolishly       And yet  my dear father and mother  why should I  with such a fine   gentleman  And whom I so dearly love  And so much to my honour too    But there is something greatly awful upon my mind  in the solemn   circumstance  and a change of condition never to be recalled  though all   the prospects are so desirable  And I can but wonder at the thoughtless   precipitancy with which most young folks run into this important change   of life       So now  my dear parents  have I been brought to fix so near a day as   next Thursday  and this is Monday  O dear  it makes one out of breath   almost to think of it  This  though  was a great cut off  a whole week   out of ten days  I hope I am not too forward  I m sure  if it obliges my   dear master  I am justified  for he deserves of me all things in my poor   power       After this  he rode out on horseback  attended by Abraham  and did not   return till night  How by degrees things steal upon one  I thought even   this small absence tedious  and the more  as we expected him home to   dinner   I wish I may not be too fond  and make him indifferent  But   yet  my dear father and mother  you were always fond of one another  and   never indifferent  let the world run as it would
