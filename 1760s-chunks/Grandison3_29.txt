to wish he had suffered a creature  with whom he had been familiar  to destroy herself —I could hardly bear him  Only that I thought it would be serving both wretches  and giving both a chance for repentance  or I should not have kept my seat—But we see in my mother  and in her brother  how habitual wickedness debases  and how habitual goodness exalts  the human mind  In their youth they were supposed nearer an equality in their understandings and attainments  than in their maturity  when occasion called out into action their respective talents  But perhaps the brother was not the better man for the uninterrupted prosperity that attended him  and for having never met with check or controul  whereas the most happily married woman in the world must have a will to which she must sometimes resign her own  What a glory to a good woman must it be  who can not only resign her will  but make so happy an use of her resignation  as my mother did   My Lord repeated his request  that I would talk with the woman  and that directly   I withdrew  and sent for her  accordingly   She came to me  out of breath with passion  and  as I thought  partly with apprehension for what her own behaviour might be before me     71 I see  Mrs  Giffard  said I  that you are in great emotion  I am desired to talk with you  a task I am not very fond of  But you will find nothing but civility  such as is due to you  for your sex s sake  from me  Calm  therefore  your mind  I will see you again  in a few moments   I took a turn  and soon came back  Her face looked not quite so bloated  and she burst into tears  She began to make a merit of her services  her care  her honesty  and then inveighed against my Lord for the narrowness of his spirit  She paid some compliments to me  and talked of being ashamed to appear before me as a guilty creature  introductory to what she was prepared to say of her sacrifices  the loss of her good name  and the like  on which  with respect to my Lord  and his ingratitude to her  as she called it  she laid great stress   I am never displeased  my dear friend  with the testimony which the most profligate women bear to the honour of virtue  when they come to set a value upon their departure from it   You have it not to say  Mrs  Giffard  that my Lord betrayed  seduced  or deceived you  I say not this so much for reproach  as for justice sake  and not to suffer you to deceive yourself  and to load him with greater faults than he has been guilty of  You were your own mistress  You had no father  mother  husband  to question you  or to be offended with you  You knew your duty  You were treated with as a sole and independent person  One hundred and fifty pounds a year  Mrs  Giffard  tho  a small price for the virtue of a good woman  which is indeed above all price  is  nevertheless  greatly above the price of common service  I never seek to palliate faults of a flagrant nature  tho  it is not my meaning to assront  a woman especially  and one who supposes herself in distress  You must know  madam  the frail tenure by which you are likely to hold  You stipulated    72 therefore  for a provision  accordingly  The woman who never hoped to be a wife  can have no hardships to take the stipulation  and once more give herself the opportunity to recover her lost fame  This independence my Lord is desirous to give you—  What independence  Sir   One hundred and fifty—  Two hundred and fifty  Sir  if you please—If my Lord thinks fit to dismiss me   My Lord has told me  that that was indeed the stipulation  but he pleads misbehaviour   I was willing to make a little difficulty of the 100 l  a year  tho  I thought my Lord ought not—And as to misbehaviour  Dr  Bartlett  I hardly know how to punish a woman for that  to her keeper  Does she not first misbehave to herself  and to the laws of God and man  And ought a man  that brings her to violate her first duties  to expect from her a regard to a mere discretionary obligation  I would have all these moralists  as they affect to call themselves  suffer by such libertine principles as cannot be pursued  but in violation of the very first laws of morality   Misbehaviour  Sir  He makes this plea to cover his own baseness of heart  I never misbehaved  as he calls it  till I saw—  Well  madam  this may lead to a debate that can answer no end  I presume  you are as willing to leave my Lord  as he is to part with you  It must be a wretchedness beyond what I can well imagine  to live a life of guilt
