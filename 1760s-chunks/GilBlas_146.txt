and own it at some future period  and the further information that it had been baptized by the name of Alphonso  I was that unfortunate stranger in the world  and this is all that I know about myself  Whether honour or profligacy was the motive of the exposure  the helpless child was equally the victim  whether my unhappy mother wanted to get rid of me  to conceal an habitual course of scandalous amours  or whether she had made a single deviation from the path of virtue with a faithless lover  and had been obliged to protect her fame at the expense of nature and the maternal feelings   However this might be  the Baron and his wife were touched by my destitute condition  and resolved  as they had no children of their own  to bring me up under the name of Don Alphonso  As I grew in years and stature their attachment to me strengthened  My manners  genteel before strangers and affectionate towards them  were the theme of their fondest panegyric  In short  they loved me as if I had been their own  Masters of every description were provided for me  My education became their leading object  and far from waiting impatiently till my parents should come forward  they seemed  on the contrary  to wish that my birth might always remain a mystery  As soon as the Baron thought me old enough to bear arms  he sent me into the service  With my ensign s commission  a genteel and suitable equipment was provided for me  and  the more effectually to animate me in the career of glory  my patron pointed out that the path of honour was open to every adventurer  and that the renown of a warrior would be so much the more creditable to me  as I should owe it to none but myself  At the same time he laid open to me the circumstances of my birth  which he had hitherto concealed  As I had passed for his son in Madrid  and had actually thought myself so  it must be owned that this communication gave me some uneasiness  I could not then  nor can I even now  think of it without a sense of shame  In proportion as the innate feelings of a gentleman bear testimony to the birth of one  am I mortified at being rejected and renounced by the unnatural authors of my being   I went to serve in the Low Countries  but peace was concluded in a short time  and Spain finding herself without assailants  though not without assassins  I returned to Madrid  where I received fresh marks of affection from the Baron and his wife  Rather more than two months after my return  a little page came into my room one morning  and presented me with a note couched nearly in the following terms      I am neither ugly nor crooked  and yet you often see me at my window without the tribute of a glance  This conduct is little in unison with the spirit of your physiognomy  and so far stings me to revenge that I will make you love me if possible    On the perusal of this epistle  there could be no doubt but it came from a widow  by name Leonora  who lived opposite our house  and had the character of a very great coquette  Hereupon I examined my little messenger  who had a mind to be on the reserve at first  but a ducat in hand opened the floodgates of his intelligence  He even took charge of an answer to his mistress  confessing my guilt  and intimating that its punishment was far advanced   I was not insensible to a conquest even of this kind  For the rest of the day home and my window seat were the grand attraction  and the lady seemed to have fallen in love with her window seat too  I madesignals  She returned them  and on the very next day sent me word by her little Mercury  that if I would be in the street on the following night between eleven and twelve  I might converse with her at a window on the ground  floor  Though I did not feel myself very much captivated by so coming on a kind of widow  it was impossible not to send such an answer as if I was  and a sort of amorous curiosity made me as impatient as if I had really been in love  In the dusk of the evening  I went sauntering up and down the Prado till the hour of assignation  Before I could get to my appointment  a man mounted on  a fine horse alighted near me  and coming up with a peremptory air    Sir  said he  are not you the son of Baron Steinbach  I answered in the affirmative  You are the person then  resumed he  who were to meet Leonora at her window to  night  I have seen her letters and your answers  her page has put them into my hands  and I have followed you this evening from your own house hither  to let you know you have a rival whose pride is not a little wounded at a competition with yourself in an affair of the heart  It would be unnecessary to say more  We are in a retired place  let us therefore draw  unless  to
