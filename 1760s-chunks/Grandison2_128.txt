upon answering objections to him  which I have thought insufficient  And indeed  Charlotte  some of your objections have been so slight  that I was ready to believe  you put them for the pleasure of having them answered   My Charlotte need not doubt of admirers  where—ever she sets her foot  And I repeat  that whoever be the man she inclines to favour  she may depend upon the approbation and good offices of  Her ever affectionate brother  CHARLES GRANDISON   LETTER XXXIII  Miss HARRIET BYRON  To Miss SELBY    Friday  Mar  17   I SEND you inclosed  to be returned by the first opportunity  Sir Charles s Letter to his sister  acquainting her with the happy conclusion of the affair between Captain Anderson and her  Her brother  as   320 you will see▪ acquits her not of precipitation  If he did  it would have been an impeachment of this justice  O the dear Charlotte  how her pride is piqued at the meanness of the man  But no more of this subject  as the Letter is before you   And now  my dear and honoured friends  let me return you a thousand thanks for the great pacquet of my Letters  just sent me  with a most indulgent one from my aunt  and another from my uncle   I have already put into the two Ladies  and my Lord s  without reserve  all the Letters that reach to the masquerade affair  from the time of my setting out for London  and when they have heard those  I have promised them more  This confidence has greatly obliged them  and they are employed  with no small earnestness  in perusing them   This gives me an opportunity of pursuing my own devices—And what  besides scribling  do you think one of them is—A kind of persecution of Dr  Bartlett  by which  however  I suspect  that I myself am the greatest sufferer  He is an excellent man  and I make no difficulty of going to him in his closet  encouraged by his assurances of welcome   Let me stop to say  my Lucy  that when I approach this good man in his retirement  surrounded by his books  his table generally covered with those on pious subjects  I  in my heart  congratulate the saint  and inheritor of future glory  and in that great view am the more desirous to cultivate his friendship   And what do you think is our subject  Sir Charles  I suppose  you guess—And so it is  either in the middle or latter end of the few conversations we have yet had time to hold  But  I do assure you  we begin with the sublimest  tho  I must say  to my shame  that it has not so much of my heart  at present  as once it had  and I hope again it will one day have—The great and glorious truths of Christianity  are this subject  which yet  from this good Dr  Bartlett    321 warms my heart  as often as he enters into it  But this very subject  sublime as it is  brings on the other  as of consequence  For Sir Charles Grandison  without making an ostentatious pretension to religion  is the very Christian in practice  that these doctrines teach a man to be  Must not then the doctrines introduce the mention of a man who endeavours humbly to imitate the Divine example  It was upon good grounds he once said  That as he must one day die  it was matter of no moment to him  whether it were to morrow  or forty years hence   The Ladies had referred me to the Doctor himself for a more satisfactory account than they had given me  how Sir Charles and he first came acquainted  I told him so  and asked his indulgence to me in this enquiry   He took it kindly  He had  he said  the history of it written down  His nephew  whom he often employs as his amanuensis  should make me out  from that little history an account of it  which I might shew  he was pleased to say  to such of my select friends  as I entrusted with the knowlege of my own heart   I shall impatiently expect the abstract of this little history  and the more  as the Doctor tells me  there will be included some particulars of Sir Charles s behaviour abroad in his younger life  and of Mr  Beauchamp  whom the Doctor speaks of with love  as his patron s dearest friend  and whom he calls a second Sir Charles Grandison   SEE  my Lucy  the reward of frankness of heart  My communicativeness has been already encouraged with the perusal of two Letters from the same excellent man to Doctor Bartlett  to whom  from early days  as I shall be soon more particularly informed  he has given an account of all his conduct and movements     322 The Doctor drew himself in  however  by reading to Lord L  and the Ladies  and me  a paragraph or two out of one of them  And he has even allowed me to give my grandmamma and aunt a sight of them  Return them  Lucy
