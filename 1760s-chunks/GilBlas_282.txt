an alliance with Don Austin s murderer  a still stronger reason henceforward presses  to detach you from Don Gaston  It may well overwhelm you with shame  to have been his dupe so long  Here is an undeniable proof of his inconstancy  Only read this letter just received by a merchant of Coria from Italy  The trembling Helena caught at this forged paper  glanced over the writing  then weighed every expression  and stood aghast at the import of the whole  A keen pang of disappointment wrung from her a few reluctant tears  but pride came to her assistance  she wiped away the falling drops of weakness  and said to her father in a determined tone  Sir  you have just been witness of my folly  now bear testimony to my triumph over myself  The delusion is past  Don Gaston is the object of my utter contempt  I am ready to meet Don Blas at the altar  and be beforehand with the traitor in the pledge of our transferred affections  Don George  transported with joy at this change  embraced his daughter  extolled her spirit to the skies  and hastened the necessary preparations  with all the self complacency of a successful plotter   Thus was Donna Helena snatched from me  She threw herself into the arms of Combados in a pet  not listening to the secret whispers of love within her breast  nor suspecting a story which ought to have seemed so improbable in the annals of true passion  The haughty are always the victims of their own rash conclusions  Resentment of insulted beauty triumphed wholly over the suggestions of tenderness  And yet  a few days after marriage  there came over her some feelings of remorse for her precipitation  it struck her that the letter might have been a forgery  and the very possibility disturbed her peace  But the enamoured Don Blas left his wife no time to nurse up thoughts injurious to their new found joys  a succession of gaiety and pleasure kept her in a thoughtless whirl  and shielded her from the pangs of unavailing repentance   She appeared to be in high good humour with so spirit stirring a husband  so that they were living together in perfect unanimity  when my aunt adjusted my affair with Don Austin s relations  Of this she wrote me word to Italy  I returned on the wings of love  Donna Eleonora  not having announced the marriage  informed me of it on my arrival  and remarking what pain it gave me  said  You are in the wrong  nephew  to shew so much feeling for a faithless fair  Banish from your memory a person so unworthy to share in its tender recollections   As my aunt did not know how Donna Helena had been played upon  she had reason to talk as she did  nor could she have given me better advice  To affect indifference  if not to conquer my passion  was my bounden duty  Yet there could be no harm in just inquiring by what means this union had been brought to bear  To get at the truth  I determined on applying to Felicia s friend Theodora  There I met with Felicia herself  who was confounded at my unwelcome presence  and would have escaped from the necessity of explanation  But I stopped her  Why do you avoid me  said I  Has your perjured mistress forbidden you to give ear to my complaints  or would you make a merit with the ungrateful woman  of your voluntary refusal   Sir  answered the plotting abigail  I confess my fault  and throw myself on your mercy  Your appearance here has filled me with remorse  My mistress has been betrayed  and unhappily in part by my agency  The particulars of their infernal device followed this avowal  with an endeavour to make me amends for its lamentable consequence  To this effect  she offered me her services with her mistress  and promised to undeceive her  in a word  to work night and day  that she might soften the rigour of my sufferings  and open the career of hope   I pass over the numberless contradictions she experienced  before she could accomplish the projected interview  It was at length arranged to admit me privately  while Don Blas was at his hunting seat  The plot did not linger  The husband went into the country  and they sent for me to his lady s apartment   My onset was reproachful in the extreme  but my mouth was shut upon the subject  It is useless to look back upon the past  said the lady  It can be no part of our present intention to work upon each other s feelings  and you are grievously mistaken  if you fancy me inclined to flatter your aspiring hopes  My sole inducement for receiving you here was to tell you personally  that you have only henceforth to forget me  Perhaps I might have been better satisfied with my lot  had it been united with yours  but since heaven has ordered it otherwise  we must submit to its decrees   What  madam  answered I  is it not enough to have lost you  to see my successful rival in quiet possession of all my soul holds dear  but I must also banish you from my thoughts  You would tear from me even my passion  my only
