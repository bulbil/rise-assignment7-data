 and put  now and then  a little bit on my plate    and guided it to my mouth  I was concerned to receive his goodness with   so ill a grace  Well  said he  if you won t eat with me  drink at least   with me  I drank two glasses by his over persuasions  and said  I am   really ashamed of myself  Why  indeed  said he  my dear girl  I am not   a very dreadful enemy  I hope  I cannot bear any thing that is the least   concerning to you  Oh  sir  said I  all is owing to the sense I have of   my own unworthiness   To be sure  it cannot be any thing else       He rung for the things to be taken away  and then reached a chair    and sat down by me  and put his kind arms about me  and said the most   generous and affecting things that ever dropt from the honey flowing   mouth of love  All I have not time to repeat  some I will  And oh    indulge your foolish daughter  who troubles you with her weak nonsense    because what she has to say  is so affecting to her  and because  if she   went to bed  instead of scribbling  she could not sleep       This sweet confusion and thoughtfulness in my beloved Pamela  said   the kind man  on the near approach of our happy union  when I hope all   doubts are cleared up  and nothing of dishonour is apprehended  shew me   most abundantly  what a wretch I was to attempt such purity with a worse   intention  No wonder  that one so virtuous should find herself deserted   of life itself on a violence so dreadful to her honour  and seek a   refuge in the shadow of death   But now  my dearest Pamela  that you   have seen a purity on my side  as nearly imitating your own  as our sex   can shew to yours  and since I have  all the day long  suppressed even   the least intimation of the coming days  that I might not alarm your   tender mind  why all this concern  why all this affecting  yet sweet   confusion  You have a generous friend  my dear girl  in me  a protector   now  not a violator of your innocence  Why then  once more I ask  this   strange perplexity  this sweet confusion       O sir  said I  and hid my face on his arm  expect not reason from a   foolish creature  You should have still indulged me in my closet  I am   ready to beat myself for this ungrateful return to your goodness  But   I know not what   I am  to be sure  a silly creature  O had you but   suffered me to stay by myself above  I should have made myself ashamed   of so culpable a behaviour   But goodness added to goodness every   moment  and the sense of my own unworthiness  quite overcome my spirits       Now  said the generous man  will I  though reluctantly  make a proposal   to my sweet girl   If I have been too pressing for the day  If another   day will still be more obliging  If you have fears you will not then   have  you shall say but the word  and I ll submit  Yes  my Pamela  for   though I have  these three days past  thought every tedious hour a day    till Thursday comes  if you earnestly desire it  I will postpone it    Say  my dear girl  freely say  but accept not my proposal  without great   reason  which yet I will not ask for       Sir  said I  I can expect nothing but superlative goodness  I have been   so long used to it from you  This is a most generous instance of it  but   I fear  yes  I fear it will be too much the same thing  some days hence    when the happy  yet  fool that I am  dreaded time  shall be equally   near       Kind  lovely charmer  said he  now do I see you are to be trusted with   power  from the generous use you make of it   Not one offensive word or   look  from me  shall wound your nicest thoughts  but pray try to subdue   this over scrupulousness  and unseasonable timidity  I persuade myself   you will if you can       Indeed  sir  I will  said I  for I am quite ashamed of myself  with all   these lovely views before me   The honours you do me  the kindness you
