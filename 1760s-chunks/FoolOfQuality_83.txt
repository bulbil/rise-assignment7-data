very feelingly re    futed its evidence  he moved his fingers over and over every part   of the surface   but found all smooth and fair  in spite of the late   sensible demonstration to the contrary      Down again  with slow caution  subsided Mr  Vindex  recon    noitring the premises to the right hand and to the left      As his temper was not now in the most dulcet disposition  he   first looked sternly at Ned  and then turning toward Harry  with   an eye that sought occasion for present quarrel  he questioned him   morosely on some articles of his lesson   when Ned  not enduring   such an indignity to the patron of his life and fortunes  gave a   second twitch with better will  and much more lively than the   first  and up again sprung Vindex with redoubled vigour and   action  and bounded  plunged  and pranced about the room  as be    witched  He glared  and searched all about with a frantic pene    tration  and peered into every corner for the visible or invisible   perpetrators of these mischiefs   when  hearing a little titter  he   began to smell a fox  and  with a malignant determination of   better note for the future  he returned with a countenance of dis    sembled placability  and  resuming his chair  began to examine the   boys with a voice apparently tuned by good temper and affection      During this short scene  poor Ned happened to make a little   trip in his rudiments  when Vindex turned  and cried to our hero   Mr  Harry  my dear  be so kind as to get up and reach me yon   ferule      These words had not fully passed the lips of the luckless pre    ceptor  when Ned plucked the string with his utmost force  and   Vindex thought himself at least impaled on the spot  Up he shot   once more  like a sudden pyramid of flame  The ground could no   longer retain him he soared aloft  roared and raved like a thou    sand infernals  While Ned  with an aspect of the most condoling   hypocrisy  and words broke by a tone of mourning  tenderly   inquired of his ailments      Vindex turned upon him an eye of jealous malignity  and  taking   a sudden thought  he flew to the scene of his repeated infliction    and turning up the bottom of the seat of pain  this complicated   effort  of extraordinary genius lay revealed  and exposed to vulgar   contemplation          60 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      He first examined minutely into the parts and construction of   this wonderful machinery  whose efficacy he still so feelingly recol    lected  He then drew the string  and admired with what a   piercing agility the needle could be actuated by so distant a hand    And lastly  and deliberately  he tore away  piece by piece  the   whole composition  as his rascally brethren  the Turks  have also   done  in their antipathy to all the monuments of arts  genius  and   learning  throughout the earth      In the mean while  our friend Edward sat trembling and frying   in his skin  All his drollery had forsaken him   nor had he a single   cast of contrivance for evading the mountain of mischiefs that he   saw impending  How  indeed  could he palliate   what had he to   hope or plead in mitigation of the penalty  where  in the party so   highly offended  he saw his judge and his executioner       Mr  Vindex had now the ball wholly at his own foot   and that   Ned was ever to have his turn again  was a matter no way pro    mised by present appearances      Vindex at length looked smilingly about him  with much fun in   his face  but more vengeance in his heart Mr  Edward  said he    perhaps you are not yet apprised of the justice of the Jewish laws    that claim an eye for an eye  and a breach for a breach   but I  my   child  will fully instruct you in the fitness and propriety of them      Then  reaching at the rod  he seized his shrinking prey as a kite   trusses a robin   he laid him  like a little sack  across his own stool     off go the trousers  and with the left hand he holds him down  while   the right is laid at him with the application of a woodman  who   resolves to clear part of the forest before noon      Harry  who was no way
