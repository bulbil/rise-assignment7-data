think you may do any thing with the men  Poor Sir Frederick   will break his heart  or run mad  that s to be sure  if you don t send   him a favourable answer to this letter   In speaking these words  she   delivered a letter to Miss Betsy  which that young lady opened with a   careless air  and it contained these high flown lines             This humbly to be presented to the most beautiful of all        beauties  the super excellent Miss Betsy Thoughtless            Adorable creature            I am grieved to the very soul to hear you have any subject for        affliction  but am very certain that  in being deprived of your        divine presence  I endure a more mortal stab than any loss you have        sustained can possibly inflict  I am consumed with the fire of my        passion  I have taken neither repose nor food since first I saw        you  I have lived only on the idea of your charms  Oh  nourish me        with the substance  Hide me in your bosom from the foul fiend        Despair  that is just ready to lay hold on me            The passion I am possessed of for you is not like that of other        men  I cannot wait the tedious forms of courtship  there is no        medium between death and the enjoyment of you  the circle of your        arms  or a cold leaden shroud  the one or the other must very        shortly be my portion  But I depend upon the heaven of your mercy         and hope you will permit me to pour forth the abundance of my soul        before you  to bask in the sunshine of your smiles  and to try  at        least  if no spark of that amorous flame  which burns me up  has        darted upon you  and kindled you into soft desires            O  if any part of my impatient fires  by secret sympathy  should        happily have reached your breast  never was there a pair so        transcendently blest as we should be  The thought is rapture         Extasy too big for words  too mighty for description  And I must         therefore  for a few hours  defer any farther endeavours to        convince you  till when I remain  absorbed in the delightful image         dear quintessence of joy  your most devoted  most obsequious  and        most adoring vassal            F  FINEER        In spite of the serious humour Miss Betsy was in  she could not read   this without bursting into a violent fit of laughter  but soon composing   herself   If I had not seen the author of this epistle   said she to   Mrs  Modely   I should have thought it had been sent me by some   school boy  and was the first essay of describing a passion he had heard   talked of  and was ambitious of being supposed capable of feeling  But    sure   continued she   the man must be either mad  or most impudently   vain  to write to me as if he imagined I was in love with him  and would   have him on his first putting the question to me         Ah  my dear Madam   said Mrs  Modely   do you consider that a young   gentleman of ten thousand a year in possession  as much more in   reversion  and the expectation of a coronet  is not apt to think he may   have any body     If he does  he may find himself mistaken   replied   Miss Betsy haughtily  and then in the same breath softening her voice     But are you sure   cried she   that he has so much     Sure  Madam     said Mrs  Modely   Aye  as sure that I am alive  I have heard it from   twenty people  They say he has a house in the country as big as a town    and above fifty servants in it
