him with the means by which their   sister had been seduced into the danger he had so happily delivered her   from  and Mr  Trueworth  in his turn  informed them of the accident that   had so seasonably brought him to her relief  which latter  as the reader   is yet ignorant of  it is proper should be related        Having sent   said he   for my steward to come to town  on account of   some leases I am to sign  the poor man had the misfortune to break his   leg as he was stepping out of the stagecoach  and was carried directly   to Mrs  Modely s  where  it seems  he has formerly lodged  This casualty   obliged me to go to him  As a maid servant was shewing me to his room     which is up two pair of stairs  I heard the rustling of silks behind   me  and casting my eyes over the banister  I saw Miss Betsy  and a woman   with her  who I since found was Mrs  Modely  pass hastily into a room on   the first floor        A curiosity   continued he   which I cannot very well account for    induced me to ask the nurse who attends my steward  what lodgers there   were below  To which she replied  that they said he was a baronet  but   that she believed nothing of it  for the two fellows who passed for his   servants were always with him  and  she believed  ate at the same table    for they never dined in the kitchen   Besides   said she   I have never   seen two or three shabby  ill looked men  that have more the appearance   of pick pockets  than companions for a gentleman  come after him  and    indeed  I believe he is no better than a rogue himself         Though I was extremely sorry   pursued Mr  Trueworth   to find Miss   Betsy should be the guest of such a person  yet I could not forbear   laughing at the description this woman gave of him  which  however    proved to be a very just one  I had not been there above half an hour   before I heard the shrieks of a woman  and fancied it the voice of Miss   Betsy  though I had never heard it made use of in that manner  I went    however  to the top of the stair case  where  hearing the cries   redoubled  I drew my sword  and ran down  The door of the chamber was   locked  but  setting my foot against it  I easily bursted it open  and    believe  entered but just in time to save the lady from violation        On seeing the face   added he   of this pretended baronet  I   immediately knew him to be a fellow who waited on a gentleman I was   intimate with at Paris  What his real name is I either never heard or   have forgot  for his master never called him by any other than that of   Quaint  on account of the romantick and affected manner in which he   always spoke  The rascal has a little smattering of Latin  and  I   believe  has dipped into a good many of the ancient authors  He seemed    indeed  to have more of the fop than the knave in him  but he soon   discovered himself to be no less the one than the other  for he ran away   from his master  and robbed him of things to a considerable value  He   was pursued and taken  but the gentleman permitted him to make his   escape  without delivering him into the hands of justice        After this mutual recapitulation  the two brothers began to consider   what was to be done for the chastisement of the villain  as the   prosecuting him by law would expose their sister s folly  and prove the   most mortal stab that could be given to her reputation  The one was for   cutting off his ears  the other for pinning him against the very wall of   the chamber where he had offered the insult  To which Mr  Trueworth   replied   I must confess his crime deserves much more than your keenest   resentments can inflict  but these are punishments which are only the   prerogative of law  to which  as you rightly judge  it would be improper   to have recourse  I am afraid  therefore  you must content yourselves   with barely caning him  that is   continued he   if he is yet in the way   for it  but I shrewdly suspect he has before now made off  as well as   his confederates  the parson and
