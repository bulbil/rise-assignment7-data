  thee   said ALMORAN   that which will at once dismiss thee to those   regions  where the wicked cease from troubling  and the weary rest for   ever   He then produced the poignard from his bosom  and presenting it   to HAMET   Take this   said he   and sleep in peace        HAMET  whose heart was touched with sudden joy at the sight of so   unexpected a remedy for every evil  did not immediately reflect  that he   was not at liberty to apply it  he snatched it in a transport from the   hand of ALMORAN  and expressed his sense of the obligation by clasping   him in his arms  and shedding the tears of gratitude in his breast   Be   quick   said ALMORAN  this moment I must leave thee  and in the next    perhaps  the messengers of destruction may bind thee to the rack   I   will be quick   said HAMET   and the sigh that shall last linger upon my   lips  shall bless thee   They then bid each other farewel  ALMORAN   retired from the dungeon  and the door was again closed upon HAMET       Caled  who waited at the door till the supposed Osmyn should return    presented him with the beverage which he had prepared  of which he   recounted the virtues  and ALMORAN received it with pleasure  and having   eagerly drank it off  returned to the palace  As soon as he was alone    he resumed his own figure  and fate  with a confident and impatient   expectation  that in a short time a messenger would be dispatched to   acquaint him with the death of HAMET  HAMET  in the mean time  having   grasped the dagger in his hand  and raised his arm for the blow   This     said he   is my passport to the realms of peace  the immediate and only   object of my hope   But at these words  his mind instantly took the   alarm   Let me reflect   said he   a moment  from what can I derive hope   in death   from that patient and persevering virtue  and from that   alone  by which we fulfill the task that is assigned us upon the earth    Is it not our duty  to suffer  as well as to act  If my own hand   consigns me to the grave  what can it do but perpetuate that misery    which  by disobedience  I would shun  what can it do  but cut off my   life and hope together   With this reflection he threw the dagger from   him  and stretching himself again upon the ground  resigned himself to   the disposal of the Father of man  most Merciful and Almighty       ALMORAN  who had now resolved to send for the intelligence which he   longed to hear  was dispatching a messenger to the prison  when he was   told that Caled desired admittance to his presence  At the name of   Caled  he started up in an extasy of joy  and not doubting but that   HAMET was dead  he ordered him to be instantly admitted  When he came   in  ALMORAN made no enquiry about HAMET  because he would not appear to   expect the event  which yet he supposed he had brought about  he    therefore  asked him only upon what business he came   I come  my   lord   said he   to apprize thee of the treachery of Osmyn    I know     said ALMORAN   that Osmyn is a traitor  but of what dost thou accuse   him   As I was but now   said he   changing the guard which is set upon   HAMET  Osmyn came up to the door of the prison  and producing the royal   signet demanded admittance  As the command which I received  when he was   delivered to my custody  was absolute  that no foot should enter  I   doubted whether the token had not been obtained  by fraud  for some   other purpose  yet  as he required admittance only  I complied  but that   if any treachery had been contrived  I might detect it  and that no   artifice might be practised to favour an escape  I waited myself at the   door  and listening to their discourse I overheard the treason that I   suspected    What then   said ALMORAN   didst thou hear    A part of   what was said   replied Caled   escaped me  but I heard Osmyn  like a   perfidious and presumptuous slave  call ALMORAN a tyrant  I heard him   profess an inviolable friendship for HAMET  and assure him of   deliverance  What were the means
