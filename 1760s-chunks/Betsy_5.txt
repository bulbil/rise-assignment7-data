not of a   humour to give herself much pains in examining  or weighing in the   balance of judgment  the merit of the arguments she heard urged  whether   for or against any point whatsoever  She had a great deal of wit  but   was too volative for reflection  and as a ship without sufficient   ballast is tossed about at the pleasure of every wind that blows  so was   she hurried through the ocean of life  just as each predominant passion   directed       But I will not anticipate that gratification which ought to be the   reward of a long curiosity  The reader  if he has patience to go through   the following pages  will see into the secret springs which set this   fair machine in motion  and produced many actions which were ascribed    by the ill judging and malicious world  to causes very different from   the real ones       All this  I say  will be revealed in time  but it would be as absurd in   a writer to rush all at once into the catastrophe of the adventures he   would relate  as it would be impracticable in a traveller to reach the   end of a long journey  without sometimes stopping at the inns in his way   to it  To proceed  therefore  gradually with my history       The father of Miss Betsy was a very worthy  honest  and good natured   man  but somewhat too indolent  and  by depending too much on the   fidelity of those he entrusted with the management of his affairs  had   been for several years involved in a law suit  and  to his misfortune    the aversion he had to business rendered him also incapable of   extricating himself from it  and the decision was spun out to a much   greater length than it need to have been  could he have been prevailed   upon to have attended in person the several courts of justice the cause   had been carried through by his more industrious adversary  The   exorbitant bills  however  which his lawyers were continually drawing   upon him  joining with the pressing remonstrances of his friends  at   last rouzed him from that inactivity of mind which had already cost him   so dear  and determined him not only to take a journey to London  but   likewise not to return home  till he had seen a final end put to this   perplexing affair       Before his departure  he went to the boarding school  to take his leave   of his beloved Betsy  and renew the charge he had frequently given the   governess concerning her education  adding  in a mournful accent  that   it would be a long time before he saw her again       These words  as it proved  had somewhat of prophetick in them  On his   arrival in London  he found his cause in so perplexed and entangled a   situation  as gave him little hopes of ever bringing it to a favourable   issue  The vexation and fatigue he underwent on this account  joined   with the closeness of the town air  which had never agreed with his   constitution even in his younger years  soon threw him into that sort of   consumption which goes by the name of a galloping one  and  they say  is   the most difficult of any to be removed  He died in about three months    without being able to do any great matters concerning the affair which   had drawn him from his peaceful home  and according to all probability   hastened his fate  Being perfectly sensible  and convinced of his   approaching dissolution  he made his will  bequeathing the bulk of his   estate to him whose right it was   his eldest son  then upon his travels   through the greatest part of Europe  all his personals  which were very   considerable in the Bank  and other public funds  he ordered should be   equally divided between Francis his second son   at that time a student   at Oxford  and Miss Betsy  constituting  at the same time  as trustees   to the said testament  Sir Ralph Trusty  his near neighbour in the   country  and Mr  Goodman  a wealthy merchant in the city of London  both   of them gentlemen of unquestionable integrity  and with whom he had   preserved a long and uninterrupted friendship       On the arrival of this melancholy news  Miss Betsy felt as much grief as   it was possible for a heart so young and gay as hers to be capable of    but a little time  for the most part  serves to obliterate the memory of   misfortunes of this nature  even in persons of a riper age  and had Miss   Betsy been more afflicted than she was  something happened soon after   which would have
