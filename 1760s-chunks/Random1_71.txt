sooner perceived my change of temper  than they abandoned me  Horatio  disgusted at my insensibility  or  which is more probable  cloyed with possession  became colder and colder every day  till at last he left me altogether  without making any apology for his conduct  or securing me against the miseries of want  as a man of honour ought to have done  considering the share he had in my ruin  for I afterwards learned that the quarrel between Lothario and him  was a story trumped up to rid the one of my importunities  and give the other the enjoyment of my person  which  it seems  he lusted after  upon seeing me at the house of my seducer —Reduced to this extremity  I cursed my own simplicity  uttered horrid imprecations against the treachery of Horatio  and as I became every day more and more familiarized to the loss of innocence  resolved to be revenged on the sex in general  by practising their own arts upon themselves —Nor was an opportunity long wanting  An old gentlewoman  under pretence of sympathizing  visited me  and after having condoled with me on my misfortunes    200 and professed a disinterested friendship  began to display the art of her occupation  in encomiums on my beauty  and invectives against the wretch who had forsaken me  insinuating withal that it would be my own fault if I did not still make my fortune by the extraordinary qualifications with which nature had endowed me —I soon understood her drift  and gave her such encouragement to explain herself  that we came to an agreement immediately to divide the profits of my prostitution  accruing from such gallants as she should introduce to my acquaintance  The first stroke of my dissimulation  was practised upon a certain J—ge  to whom I was recommended by this matron  as an innocent creature just arrived from the country  he was so transported with my appearance and feigned simplicity  that he paid a hundred guineas for the possession of me for one night only  during which I behaved in such a manner  as to make him perfectly well pleased with his purchase     201  CHAP  XXIII   She is interrupted by a bailif  who arrests  and carries her to the Marshalsea—I accompany her—bring witnesses to prove she is not the same person named in the writ—the bailif is fain to give her a present  and discharge her—we shift our lodging—she resumes her story and ends it—my reflections thereupon—she makes me acquainted with the progress of a common woman of the town—resolves to quit that way of life   HER story was here interrupted by a rap at the door  which I no sooner opened  than three or four terrible fellows rushed in  one of whom accosted my fellow lodger thus —   Madam  your servant—you must do me the favour to come along with me—I have got a writ against you  —  While the bailif  for so he was  spoke thus  his followers surrounded the prisoner  and began to handle her very roughly —This treatment incensed me so much  that I snatched up the poker  and would certainly have used it in defence of the lady  without any regard to the strength and number of her adversaries  had not she begged me with a composure of countenance  for which I could not account  to use no violence in her behalf  which could be of no service to her  but might be very detrimental   202 to myself —Then turning to the leader of this formidable troop  she desired to see the warrant  and having perused it  said with a faultering voice    I am not the person whose name is here mentioned  arrest me at your peril  —   Ay  ay  Madam   replied the catch pole  we shall prove your identity —In the mean time  whether will you be pleased to be carried to my house or to Jail  —   If I must be confined  said she  I would rather have your house for a prison than a common Jail  —   Well  well   answered he  if you have money enough in your pocket  you shall be entertained like a princess  —  But when she acquainted him with her poverty  he swore he never gave credit  and ordered one of his myrmidons to call a coach to carry her to the Marshalsea at once —While this was a doing she took me aside  and bid me be under no concern on her account  for she knew how to extricate herself from this difficulty very soon  and perhaps gain something by the occasion —Although her discourse was a mystery to me  I was very well pleased with her assurance  and when the coach came to the door  offered to accompany her to prison  to which  after much intreaty  she consented —When we arrived at the gate of the Marshalsea  our conductor alighted  and having demanded entrance  presented the writ to the turnkey  who no sooner perceived the name of Elizabeth Cary  than he cried    Ah ha  my old acquaintance Bett  I m glad to see thee with all my heart  —  So saying he opened the coach door  and helped her to dismount  but when he observed her face  he started back  saying
