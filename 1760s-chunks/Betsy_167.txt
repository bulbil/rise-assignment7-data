    Mrs  Modely went out of the room several times  as if called away by   some household affairs  that Sir Frederick might have an opportunity of   declaring his passion to Miss Betsy  which he did in much the same   rodomontade strain with which he had at first accosted her  A handsome   supper was served in  after which  she being about to take her leave  he   affected to be in a great fret  that a fine new chariot which  he said    he had bespoke  was not come home  that he might have seen her safe to   her lodgings  with an equipage suitable to her merit  and the admiration   he had of it  he would needs  however  attend her in another chair    which piece of gallantry  after a few faint refusals  she accepted                VOLUME THE THIRD               CHAPTER I       Relates only to such things as the reader may reasonably expect would   happen          As much taken up as Miss Betsy was with the pleasure of having gained a   new admirer  she could not forbear  after she came home  making some   reflection on the value of her conquest  she had found nothing agreeable   either in his person or conversation  the first seemed to her stiff and   awkward  and looked as if not made for his cloaths  and the latter    weak  romantick  and bombast  in fine  he was altogether such as she   could not think of living with as a husband  though the rank and figure   she was told he held in the world  made her willing to receive him as a   lover  In short  though she could not consent to sacrifice herself to   his quality  she took a pride to sacrifice his quality to her vanity       No overtures of marriage having been made to her since Mr  Munden began   his courtship  and that gentleman growing  as she fancied at least  a   little too presuming  on finding himself the only lover  she was not a   little pleased at the opportunity of giving him a rival whose quality   might over awe his hopes  In this idea  she was far from repenting her   behaviour towards him the night before  but how little soever she   regarded what mortification she gave the men  she always took care to   treat her own sex with a great deal of politeness  and reflecting that   she had been guilty of an omission  in not sending her servant to excuse   herself to the ladies who expected her  went herself in the morning to   make her own apology       In the mean time  Mr  Munden  who it is certain was very much out of   humour  and impatient to let her know some part of the sentiments her   message had inspired him with  came to make her a morning visit  having   some business which he knew would detain him from waiting on her in the   afternoon  On finding she was abroad  he desired the maid to favour him   with her lady s standish  which she accordingly bringing to him  he sat   down  and  without taking much consideration  wrote the following   letter  and left for her on the table             To Miss Betsy Thoughtless            Madam            Amidst the enchanting encouragement with which you have been        pleased to admit my services  I would not  without calling your        honour and generosity in question  be altogether void of hope  that        you intended to afford them one day a recompence for ample than a        bare acceptance            Judge  then  of my surprize at the repulse I met with at Mrs         Modely s door  I could not think it any breach of the respect I owe        you  to call on you at the house of your mantua maker  I could not        imagine it possible for you to have any engagements at such a place        capable of preventing you from keeping those that you had made with        persons for whom you profess an esteem  on the contrary  I rather        expected you would have permitted me to conduct you thence  with        the same readiness you have done from most of the other places
