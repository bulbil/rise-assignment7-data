that you would not  of yourself  from displeasure  have revived the subject—Not that she values—    135 There she stopt   Sir Ch  I might  at the time  be a little petulant  But I should have revived the subject  because I had engaged myself to procure an answer for an absent person  to a question that was of the highest importance to him  But  perhaps  I should have entered into the subject with Charlotte when we were alone   Lady L  She can have no objection  I believe  to let all of us  who are present  know her mind  on this occasion   Miss Gr  To be sure I have not   Lady L  What signifies mincing the matter  I undertook  at her desire  to recal the subject  because you had seemed to interest yourself in it   Sir Ch  I think I know as much of Charlotte s mind already  from what you have hinted  Lady L  as I ought to be inquisitive about   Lady L  How so  brother  What have I said   Sir Ch  What meant the words you stopt at—Not that she values  —Now  tho  I will not endeavour to lead her choice in behalf of a prince  yet would I be earnest to oppose her marriage with a man for whom she declaredly has no value   Lady L  You are a little sudden upon me  Sir Charles   Sir Ch  You must not think the words you stopt at  Lady L  slight words  Principle  and Charlotte s future happiness  and that of a worthy man  are concerned here  But perhaps you mean no more  than to give a little specimen of Lady like pride in those words  It is a very hard matter for women  on such occasions as these  to be absolutely right —Dear Miss Byron  bowing to me  excuse me—There is one Lady in the world that ought not  from what I have had the honour to see  on her own account  to take amiss my freedom with her sex  tho  she perhaps will on that of those she loves  But have I not some reason for what I say  when even Lady L  speaking   136 for her sister on this concerning subject  cannot help throwing in a salvo for the pride of her sex   Harriet  I doubt not  Sir  but Lady L  and Miss Grandison will explain themselves to your satisfaction   Lady L  then called upon her sister   Miss Gr  Why  as to value—and all that—To be sure—Lord G —is not a man  that— and she looked round her on each person —that a woman—Hem —that a woman—But  brother  I think you are a little too ready—to—to—A word and a blow  as the saying is  are two things —Not that—And there she stopt   Sir Ch   smiling  O my dear Lord L   What shall we say to these Not that s  Were I my cousin Everard  I am not sure but I should suppose  when Ladies were suspending unnecessarily  or with affectation  the happiness of the man they resolve to marry  that they were reflecting on themselves by an indirect acknowlegement of self denial  —  Miss Gr  Good God  brother   I was angry at him  in my mind  How came this good man  thought I  by such thoughts as these  of our sex  What  Lucy  could a woman do with such a man  were he to apply to her in courtship  whether she denied or accepted of him   Sir Ch  You will consider  Lady L  that you and Charlotte have brought this upon yourselves  That I call female pride  which distinguishes not either time  company  or occasion  You will remember  that Lord G  is not here  we are all brothers and sisters  And why  Charlotte  do you approve of entering upon the subject in this company  yet come with your exceptions  as if Lord G  had his father present  or pleading for him  These Not that she values  and so forth  are so like the dealings between petty chapmen and common buyers and sellers  that I love properly  observe that I say properly  to discourage them among persons of sense and honour  But come  Charlotte  enter into your own cause  You are an excellent   137 pleader  on occasion  You know  or at least you ought t• know  your own mind  I never am for encouraging agency  Lady L  excuse me—Will you give up yours   where principals can be present   Lady L  With all my heart  I stumbled at the very threshold  E en  Charlotte  be your own advocate  The cause is on   Miss Gr  Why  I don t know what to say —My brother will be so peremptory  perhaps—  Sir Ch  A good sign for somebody—Don t you think so  madam  to me —But the snail will draw in its horns  if the finger hastily touch it—Come  no good sign  perhaps  Charlotte —I will not be peremptory  You shall be
