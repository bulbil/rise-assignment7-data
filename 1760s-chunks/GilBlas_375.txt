could not be of the party  in consequence of a violent fever from distress of mind  which confined me to the castle for more than a week  During that time  the reverend Dominican paid me all possible attention  He had conceived a friendship for me  which was not confined to my worldly interests  and was anxious to know how I meant to dispose of myself on my recovery  I answered that I had not yet made up my mind upon the subject  there were moments when my feelings strongly prompted towards a religious vow  Precious moments  exclaimed the Dominican  you will do well to profit by them  I advise you as a friend to retire to our convent at Madrid  for example  there to become a pious benefactor by the free gift of your whole fortune  and to die in the livery of Saint Dominic  Many very questionable Christians have made amends for a life of sin by so holy an end   In the actual disposition of my mind  this advice was not unpalatable  and I promised to reflect upon it  But on consulting Scipio  who came to see me immediately after the monk  he treated the very notion as the phantom of a distempered brain  For shame  said he  does not your estate at Lirias offer a more eligible seclusion  If you were delighted with it formerly  the charm will be increased tenfold  now that the lapse of years has moderated your sense of pleasure  and softened down your taste to the simple beauties of nature   It was no difficult matter to operate a change in my inclinations  My friend  said I  you carry it decidedly against the advocate of Saint Dominic  We will go back to Lirias as soon as I am well enough to travel  This happened shortly  for as the fever subsided  I soon felt myself sufficiently strong to put my design in execution  We went first to Madrid  The sight of that city gave me far other sensations than heretofore  As I knew that almost its whole population held in horror the memory of a minister  of whom I cherished the most affectionate remembrance  I could not feel at my ease within its precincts  My stay was therefore limited to five or six days  while Scipio was making the necessary arrangements for our rustication  In the meantime I waited on Caporis  and received my legacy in ready money  I likewise made my arrangements with the receivers for the regular remittance of my pensions  and settled all my affairs in due order   The evening before our departure  I asked the son of Coselina whether he had received his farewell from Don Henry  Yes  answered he  we took leave of each other this morning with mutual civility  he went so far as to express his regret that I should quit him  but however well satisfied he might be with me  I am by no means so with him  Mutual content is like a river  which must have its banks on either side  Besides  Don Henry makes but a pitiful figure at court now  he has fallen into utter contempt  people point at him with their finger in the streets  and call him a Genoese bastard  Judge  then  for yourself  whether it is consistent with my character to keep up the connection   We left Madrid one morning at sunrise  and went for Cuen√ßa  The following was the order of our equipment  we two in a chaise and pair  three mules  laden with baggage and money  led by two grooms and two stout footmen  well armed  in the rear  the grooms wore sabres  and the postilion had a pair of pistols in his holsters  As we were seven men in all  and six of us determined fellows  I took the road gaily  without trembling for my legacy  In the villages through which we passed our mules chimed their bells merrily  and the peasants ran to their doors to see us pass  supposing it to be at least the parade of some nobleman going to take possession of some viceroyalty       CH  XIII     The return of Gil Blas to his seat  His joy at finding his god daughter Seraphina marriageable  and his own second venture in the lottery of love   WE were a fortnight on our journey to Lirias  having no occasion to make rapid stages  The sight of my own domain brought melancholy thoughts into my mind  with the image of my lost Antonia  but better topics of reflection came to my aid  with a full purpose to look at things on the brighter side  and the lapse of two and twenty years  which had gradually impaired the force of tender regret   As soon as I entered the castle  Beatrice and her daughter greeted me most cordially  while the family scene was interesting in the extreme  When their mutual transports were over  I looked earnestly at my god daughter  saying  Can this be the Seraphina whom I left in her cradle  how tall and pretty  we must make a good match for her  What  my dear god father  cried my little girl with an enchanting blush  you have but just seen me  and do you want to get rid of me at once
