observing my confusion at making my appearance in so wretched a garb  your dress is of very little consequence  After the important services you have rendered me  I should be the most ungrateful of my sex  if I were to do nothing for you in return  I undertake  therefore  to better your condition  it is my duty  and the means are in my power  My fortune is large enough to pay my debt of obligation to you  without putting myself to inconvenience   You know  continued she  my story up to the time when we both were committed to prison  I will now tell you what has happened to me since  When the corregidor at Astorga had sent me to Burgos  after having heard from my own lips a faithful recital of my adventures  I presented myself at the castle of Ambrosio  My return thither excited extreme surprise  but they told me that it was too late  the marquis  as if he had been thunderstruck at my flight  fell sick  and the physicians despaired of his recovery  Here was a new incident in the melancholy tragedy of my fate  Yet I ordered my arrival to be announced  The next moment I ran into his chamber  and threw myself on my knees by his bedside  with a face running down with tears and a heart oppressed with the most lively sorrow  Who sent for you hither  said he as soon as he saw me  are you come to contemplate your own contrivance  Was it not enough to have deprived me of life  But was it necessary to satisfy your heart s desire  to be an eye witness of my death  My lord  replied I  In√®s must have told you that I fled with my first husband  and  had it not been for the sad accident which has taken him from me for ever  you never would have seen me more  At the same time  I acquainted him that Don Alvar had been killed by banditti  whose captive I had consequently been in a subterraneous dungeon  After relating the particulars of my story to the end  Don Ambrosio held out to me his hand  It is enough  said he affectionately  I will make no more complaints  Alas  Have I in fact any right to reproach you  You were thrown once more in the way of a beloved husband  and gave me up to follow his fortunes  can I blame such an instance of your affection  No  madam  it would have been vain to resist the will of fate  For that reason I gave orders not to pursue you  In my rival himself I could not but respect the sacred rights with which he was invested  and even the impulse of your flight seemed to have been communicated by some superior power  To close all with an act of justice  and in the spirit of reconciliation  your return hither has re established you completely in my affection  Yes  my dear Mencia  your presence fills me with joy  but  alas  I shall not long be sensible to it  I feel my last hour to be at hand  No sooner are you restored to me  than I must bid you an eternal farewell  At these touching expressions  my tears flowed in torrents  I felt and expressed as much affliction as the human heart is capable of containing  I question whether Don Alvar s death  doting on him as I did  had cost me more bitter lamentations  Don Ambrosio had given way to no mistaken presage of his death  which happened on the following day  and I remained mistress of a considerable jointure  settled on me at our marriage  But I shall take care to make no unworthy use of it  The world shall not see me  young as I still am  wantoning in the arms of a third husband  Besides that such levity seems irreconcilable with the feelings of any but the profligate of our sex  I will frankly own the relish of life to be extinct in me  so that I mean to end my days in this convent  and to become a benefactress to it   Such was Donna Mencia s discourse about her future plans  She then drew a purse from beneath her robe  and put it into my hands  with this address  Here are a hundred ducats simply to furnish out your wardrobe  That done  come and see me again  I mean not to confine my gratitude within such narrow bounds  I returned her a thousand thanks  and promised solemnly not to quit Burgos  without taking leave of her  Having given this pledge  which I had every inclination to redeem  I went to look out for some house of entertainment  Entering the first I met with  I asked for a room  To parry the ill opinion my frock might convey of my finances  I told the landlord that  however appearances might be against me  I could pay for my night s lodging as well as a better dressed gentleman  At this speech  the landlord  whose name was Majuelo  a great banterer in a coarse way  running over me with his eyes from top to toe  answered with a cool  sarcastic grin  that there was no need of any such assurance  it was
