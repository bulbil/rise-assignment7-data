—And must I her brother  your Jeronymo  expose his sister   We gave into almost every wish of her heart  The dear Scripturist had requested a month s time to travel from place to place on the other side of the Apennines  partly in imitation of the daughter of the famous Israelitish General  a   and partly on pretence of establishing her health  implying  that she considered the meditated marriage as a sacrifice  And we had hopes at the end of it  that she would be brought to give her hand  not unchearfully  to the Count of Belvedere  for whom she owned pity and gratitude   We had consented to several trifling delays of her return to us before  Yet besought her to excuse us from allowing her to visit Rome and Naples  and she acquiesced with the reasons we gave her  She desired leave to take into her service  as a   an English youth  the nephew of a gentleman of the English factory at Leghorn  who was well recommended by his uncle  on the enquiry Mrs  Beaumont  at our desire  made into his character  We  supposing her motive to be merely an innocent and grateful regard to the country of a man whom we could allow her to respect  consented  She accordingly took him  and he attended her in her excursions to Pistoia  Prato  Pratolina  Pisa  Sienna   c   to some of which places she was accompanied by Mrs  Beaumont  and the Ladies her friends  But being desirous to see the sea coast from Piombino to Lucca  according to a plan she shewed  and talking of stretching to Genoa  when at Lucca  which was to conclude her excursions  and complete her month  she was left by those Ladies to be attended by her own servants  These  all but her  and Laura  she contrived  the high soul d Clementina stooped to art   to send different ways  ordering them to meet her at Lucca  but  instead of going thither  took a short way to   99 Leghorn  and there embarked on board an English ship ready cleared out  and bound for the port of London  and it had sailed three days  before it was known what was become of her  But then the contents of the following Letter  directed to Mrs  Beaumont  astonished that Lady  and her friends  as you will believe it did us  when it was transmitted to us in a Letter written by Mrs  Beaumont  acquainting us with the particulars of her excursions and flight  and the certainty  upon proper enquiries at Leghorn  that she was gone to England      Forgive me  my dearest Ladies  my dearest Mrs  Beaumont  particularly  forgive me  I am embarked in an enterprize  that will be enough my punishment  Pity me  therefore  as well as pardon me  The impending evil is always the most terrible  My heart is extremely averse to a married life  A fortnight of the month is expired  at the end of which I am expected to give my vows to a man not unworthy of them  could I think it in my power to make him happy  and could I be so myself in the prospects before me  But how can that be  Persuasion  cruel persuasion  A kneeling father  a fighing mother  generous  but entreating brothers  how  how can I resist you  if I go to dear  once most dear Bologna  All you  my friends  at Bologna  at Urbino  everywhere  forgive me  What have I not suffered before I came to the resolution that must be pursued  tho  repentance  when I have attained the proposed asylum  follow  My good Lord of B  forgive me also  Change your attachment  You deserve a better wife  than conscience  than honour  than justice  words that mean the same thing  tell me  can be made you  by the unhappy Clementina  She dare not add Della Porretta —Ah my mother    —    This Letter was left with a person at Leghorn    100 with orders  not to send it  till the vessel had sailed three days  We are all distracted  but most my mother   For the sake of her peace of mind  we are come to a resolution to anticipate our summers visit to you  and  unpropitious as the season is for such a journey  we shall set out next week accordingly  God give my mother strength to bear the fatigue  Courage she has  on this occasion  who never before could be brought to go by sea any where  No  not to Naples  to visit her Giacomo  and his Lady  tho  in a more propitious season   It was a long laid scheme  we imagine  for she had dismissed her faithful Camilla  on her urging her to a change of condition  I am afraid the good woman was too sedulous in obeying the orders given her by my brother  to make use of every opportunity to inspire her with tender sentiments  in favour of the Count of Belvedere  Laura has for some time been her only favourite servant   This youth
