a sweet and promising   little fellow  whom we left at nurse in our country seat  while I   attended my lord on his embassy to Morocco      But here I must stop  my brother  I am under the positive   interdiction of an imperial thing called a husband  not to divulge   a word further  till he sees you face to face  But I trust that he   has blessed tidings for you  my brother   he says that he otherwise   would not have dared to present himself before you  after his loss   of your Eloisa      Mr  Clinton smiled careless  as at the impossibility of any con    soling event upon earth  Again  smiling archly I protest  my   sister  said he  you appear to me to grow younger for your years    I see no manner of alteration  save that you are something plumper    and not quite so slender as when we parted  But pray  when   may we expect my brother   In about two months   at present he   is engaged with the king  who is extremely fond of him  and lately   created him a duke  on account of the services which he rendered   the state in Africa  We received your kind letter  my dearest   brother  at Paris  but wondered who the sweet fellow could be   who was said to accompany you      In the mean time  our hero and the young prince were in close   combination  Abenamin stepped about and about Harry  and   toyed with him  and twisted the curls of his careless locks around   his fingers  Then turning and looking fondly up in his face Ah    how fair  says he  does this black visage of mine show in those fine   eyes of yours   It is in truth  said Harry  so fair in my eyes  that   I would not exchange it for fifteen of the fairest female faces   in Britain  The prince then caught his hand  and pressed it to   his bosom  But what shall I call you   says he  You are a great   lord in this country  and in my own country I am greater than   a lord  But I hate the formality of titles between friends  and   I will call you my Harry  provided you promise to call me your   Abenamin  A bargain  says Harry   let us seal it with a kiss     No  no   says the prince  we never kiss lips in Africa   but I will   kiss your head  and your hands  and your feet too  with pleasure    But tell me  Harry  what makes you so mighty clever a fellow     will you teach me to be a clever fellow also   Ay  that I will  says   Harry  and to beat myself too  provided you promise not to hit me         410 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      over hard  Abenamin laughed  and aimed a little fist as though   he meant to overturn him      As soon as Harry s grief for his late Maria would allow him to   associate  he had been to seek his old friend and tutor  Mr  Clement    but he found only a single domestic at home  who told him that   the old gentleman had been some time dead  and that the family   were lately gone to take possession of a new seat that they had   purchased in the country      However  as Harry found himself quite happy in the present   society  he sought no further acquaintance or amusement in London    In less than three weeks the retinue of the prince and the duchess   were well restored   and they all set out for Enfield  there to await   the wished arrival of the duke      On the third day  while they stopped at a village to repair the   fractured harness of an over mettled horse  Harry took a walk with   the prince along the road  In their way they came to a long   and waste cottage  where they heard the confused clattering of   junior voices  Harry stepped to the door  and looking in  per    ceived about forty or fifty boys ranged on benches of turf  while   a man of a pale aspect sat on a decayed chair  instructing them in   their lessons      Your servant  sir  says Harry  Pray  what language do you   teach   I can teach Latin and Greek  too  sir   but the people of   this country choose to confine themselves to the language of old   England  If I am not too free  sir  pray  what is your name    Longfield
