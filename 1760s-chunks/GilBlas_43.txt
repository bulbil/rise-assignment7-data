 and playing with my ring  You have a mighty pretty brilliant there  said she  but it is small  Are you a judge of jewellery  I answered  no  I am sorry for that  resumed she  because I was in hopes you could have told me what this is worth  As she uttered these words  she showed me a large ruby on her finger  and  while I was looking at it  said    An uncle of mine  who was governor of the Spanish settlements in the Philippine isles  gave me this ruby  The jewellers at Valladolid value it at three hundred pistoles  It cannot be worth less  said I  for it is evidently a very fine stone  Why  then  since you have taken a fancy to it  replied she  an exchange is no robbery  In a twinkling she whisked off my ring  and placed her own on my little finger  After this exchange  a genteel way enough of making a present  Camilla pressed my hand and gazed at me with expressive tenderness  then  all at once breaking off the conversation  wished me good night  and re tired to hide her blushes  as if she had been ready to sink at the indiscreet avowal of her sentiments   No one hitherto had trod less in the paths of gallantry than myself  Yet I could not shut my eyes to the vista vision opened to me by this precipitate retreat  Under these circumstances  a country excursion might have its charms  Full of this flattering idea  and intoxicated with the prosperous condition of my affairs  I locked myself into my bed room  after having told my servant to call me betimes in the morning  Instead of going to sleep  I gave myself up to the agreeable reflections which my portmanteau  snug upon the table  and my ruby excited in my breast  Heaven be praised  thought I  though misfortunes have been my lot  I am unfortunate no longer  A thousand ducats here  a ring of three hundred pistoles  value there  I am in cash for a considerable time  In deed Majuelo was no flatterer  I see clearly  The ladies of Madrid will take fire like touchwood  since the green sticks of Valladolid are so inflammable  Then the kind regards of the generous Camilla arrayed themselves in all their charms  and I tasted by anticipation the amusements Don Raphael was preparing for me at his villa  In the mean while  amid so many images of pleasure  sleep was on the watch to strew his poppies on my couch  As soon as I felt myself drowsy  I undressed and went to bed   The next morning  when I awoke  I found it rather late  It was odd enough that my servant did not make his appearance  after such particular orders  Ambrose  thought I to myself  my devout Ambrose is either at church  or abominably lazy this morning  But I soon let go this opinion of him to take up a worse  for getting out of bed  and seeing no portmanteau  I suspected him to have stolen it during the night  To clear up my suspicions  I opened my chamber door  and called the religious rascal over and over again  An old man answered  saying    What is your pleasure  sir  All your folks left my house before day break  Your house  How now  exclaimed I  am I not under Don Raphael s roof  I do not know the gentleman  said he  You are in a ready furnished lodging  and I am the landlord  Yesterday evening  an hour before your arrival  the lady who supped with you came hither  and engaged this suite of apartments for a nobleman of high rank  travelling incognito  as she called it  She paid me beforehand  I was now in the secret  It was plain enough what sort of people Camilla and Don Raphael were  and I conjectured that my servant  having wormed himself into a complete knowledge of my concerns  had betrayed me to these impostors  Instead of blaming myself for this sad accident  and considering that it could never have happened but for my indiscretion in so unnecessarily betraying my confidence to Majuelo  I gave bad language to the poor harmless dame fortune  and cursed my ill star in a hundred different formularies  The master of the ready furnished lodging  to whom I related the adventure  which perhaps was as much his as mine  showed some little outward sensibility to my affliction  He lamented over me  and protested he was deeply mortified that such a play should have been acted in his house  but I verily believe  not withstanding his fine words  that he had an equal share in the cheat with mine host at Burgos  to whom I have never denied the merit of so ingenious an invention       CH  XVII     The measures Gil Blas took after the adventure of the ready furnished lodging   AFTER the first transports of my grief were over  I began to consider  that instead of giving way to remorse  I ought rather to bear up against my ill fate  I summoned back my resolution  and  by way of comfort  said to myself
