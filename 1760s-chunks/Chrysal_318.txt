from public favour  because from this circumstance   unhappily too often entangled vpith merit   but the life of the actor   would reflect the sentiments of the poet  and enforce them to imita    tion by example  Nor would it be difficult to work this important   effect  All necessary would be to refuse admission on the stage to   all notorious for vice of any kind  to banish from it such as should   become so after  however eminent in their merits  and to support   the profession by the civil power against the tyranny of the mob    so that the lives and properties of all concerned in it should be   secure from suffering such licentious outrage and injustice as no   other subjects are exposed to  and as are equally a reproach and   insult to good government and common sense  Nor need it be   apprehended that this would make them insolent  or slacken their   endeavours to please  Their very being depends on public favour    the bare withholding of which is punishment sufBciently severe    as ambition to acquire it will make them exert their utmost abilities    and always observe proper humility to the arbiters of their fate    They know that if they are neglected they cannot live  On the   contrary  it would enable them to rise to greater merit in their art    as they would no longer he under the wretched necessity of prosti    tuting their own judgment to please the gross taste of their tyrants    Many other arguments might be alleged against this grievous and   shameful abuse   but what I have said is sufficient to convince   candid reason  and vrith prejudice it is in vain to argue          CHAPTER XVI     THE SYSTEM OF POLIOY BY WHICH CHRYSAL s MASTEK GOVERNED   HIS STATE â€” ACCOTJNT OP HIS METHOD OP PARRYING POETS â€” THE   REASON WHY SO PEW NEW PLAYS ARE ACTED â€” INQUIEY INTO THE   PRESENT STATE OP GENIUS â€” THE GENERAL MOTIVES FOR WRITING   PLAYS PRECLUDE THEM PROM SUCCESS â€” MANAGERS AND POETS   EQUALLY IN FAULT IN THEIR DEALINGS WITH EACH OTHER     The day after this great affair was thus equitably settled  on the   treasurer s making up his week s accoimt  1 came into the possession         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 377     of the manager   who  having some occasion for money  put me into   his pocket      The measures of my new master s government in this little empire   were the strongest burlesque on the policy of the world  the greatest   sovereign in which had not more intrigues of state to manage  than   were continually carrying on about him  from the ambition  envy    and jealousy of the several candidates for his royal favoxir  But   all this bustle did not embarass him in the least  He had the address   to play off one party against another  and  by never engaging him    self particularly to any  was able to manage all  a method  by the   bye  that might suggest a hint not unuseful to politicians in a higher   sphere  But the part of his conduct that was most curious  and   gave me the greatest pleasure  was his manner of parrying the   attacks of the authors who were continually bringing lum their   works for representation on the stage  of which I had an opportunity   of seeing many strildng instances      As it is evidently the interest of the manager of a theatre to   exhibit those performances whose merit is most likely to gain the   approbation of the public  and as no man who is capable of writing   a piece proper for exhibition can be supposed to want judgment   to know whether it has that merit  you may naturally think tliat   there could not be much difficulty in the intercourse between them     but human actions are not always to be judged of from the strongest   appearances of reason  The representation of a new piece neces    sarily puts the manager to some expense and much trouble  If   you add to this the natural anxiety about success  for merit is   often rejected by caprice or personal prejudice  you will not wonder   that he should be cautious what he brings upon the stage  and prefer   acting old ones  unattended with these inconveniences  while the   public will bear the repetition  and does not peremptorily demand   new      This is the real reason why so few new pieces are performed  and   not any decline of poetical gem us to produce them  it being certain   that there are as many good plays written now as at any former   point of time  But the matter is this   â   11 the good ones of those   times lie together before you  and raise your opinion to
