willing to put an end to his suspence  cried out  Look up  Nourjahad  raise thy eyes to thy master s face  no longer the angry Schemerzad  thy offended prince  but the real Schemzeddin  thy friend and kind protector     ← Nourjahad →   who before  out of respect and awful distance  had not ventured to look in the sultan s face  now fixed his eyes earnestly upon him  By the life of Schemerzad  said he  if I were not certain that all this is illusion  and that thy illustrious father  my royal and once beloved master  is dead  thou art so very like him  that I should swear that thou wert the real sultan Schemzeddin  Page  223  himself  such at thy years was his countenance and features     The sultan at this burst into a second fit of laughter  And for whom  said the visier   who had by this time taken off his turban  and a false beard which he wore  for whom wouldst thou take me     By Mahomet  cried ← Nourjahad →   falling back a step or two  I should take thee for my old friend Hasem  if I were not convinced that the good man died above twenty years ago     It is time  said the sultan  descending from his throne  and taking ← Nourjahad →  Page  224  by the hand  it is now time to undeceive thee  and explain to thee the mystery of all those extraordinary events  which seem to have bewildered thy senses     Know then  ← Nourjahad →   that the adventure of thy guardian genius was all a deception  and a piece of machinery of my contrivance  You are now convinced  by the evidence of your own eyes  that your celestial intelligence was no other than this young damsel     I had a mind to make trial of thy heart  and for this purpose made choice of this charming virgin  for whom I own I had entertained a passion  but found I could not gain her affections  She had  Page  225  seen you from the windows of the womens apartments  walking with me in the gardens of the seraglio  and had conceived a tenderness for you  which she frankly confessed to me  declaring at the same time  she would never give her love to any other  Though she was my slave  I would not put a constraint upon her inclinations  but told her  if she would assist me faithfully in a design I had formed  I would reward her  by bestowing her on you     She readily assented to my proposal  and having previously prepared every thing for my purpose  I equipped her as you see     Page  226  It was not difficult for me to introduce her into your chamber  by a private door which you know communicates between your apartments  and certain lodgings in my palace     I myself stood at the door  whilst she entered as you slept  and contrived to throw that light into your chamber  which disclosed to you the wonderful vision  I overheard all your discourse  and could scarce contain my laughter  when you so greedily received that marvellous essence from Mandana  which you supposed would confer immortality  but which was in reality nothing more than a soporific drug  of so potent a  Page  227  nature  that the fumes of it alone  were capable of throwing the person who smelt to them into a profound sleep  It had quickly this effect on you  and I took that opportunity of conveying into your chamber those coffers which you thought contained such immense treasures  but which in truth were as great counterfeits as your guardian angel  The supposed precious stones  were nothing more than false gems  which I procured from a skilful lapidary  who had given them such an extraordinary polish and lustre  that they might well pass for jewels of inestimable value  on one better skilled in those matters than you were     Page  228  The ingots of gold were all base metal  which I got from the same artist  Nothing  in short  was real  but the money  part of which I was very willing to sacrifice to my experiment  though  as I have managed it  the largest sums which thou in thy extravagance hast expended  were returned into my coffers     As I naturally supposed  that so long as the money lasted you would not have recourse to the other treasures  I was not afraid of having the fraud detected  The cave  which was an accidental circumstance  but of which I had long known  was by my contrivance made the repository of thy riches     Page  229  When thou wert settled in the full possession of thy imaginary felicity  thou mayst remember that Hasem was first recommended to thy service  Mandana too was amongst other slaves presented to thy view  No wonder that her charms captivated thy heart  Her love to thee was as pure as it was fervent  but thy boundless wishes were not to be restrained  and forgetting all the rational principles that thou didst
