she considers herself not much past girl     hood  though  to do her justice  she has not a scrap of it in her behaviour   August 10  All our motions here are as regular as the clock  The family rise at six  we are summoned to breakfast at eight  at ten a venerable congregation are assembled to prayers  which an ancient clergyman  who is curate of the parish  and her ladyship’s chaplain  gives us daily  Then the old horses are put to the old coach  and my lady  with her guests  if they chuse it  take an airing  always going and returning by the same road  and driving precisely to the same land mark  and no farther  At half an hour after twelve  in a hall large enough to entertain a corporation  we sit down to dinner  my lady has a grace of a quarter of an hour long  and we are waited on by four truly venerable footmen  for she likes state  The afternoon we may dispose of as we please  at least it is a liberty I am indulged in  and I generally spend my time in the garden  or my own chamber  till I have notice given me of supper’s being on the table  where we are treated with the same ceremonials as at dinner  At ten exactly  the instant the clock strikes the first stroke  my lady rises with great solemnity  and wishes us a good night   August 14  You cannot expect  in such a house as this is  my dear  that I can be furnished with materials to give you much variety  Indeed these four last days have been so exactly the same in every particular  excepting that the dishes at dinner and supper were changed  that I had resolved to hang up my pen till I quitted Grimston hall  or at least resign it to Patty  and let her plod on and tell you how the wind blew such a day  what sort of a mantua lady Grimston had on such a day  though by the way it is always the same  always ash coloured tissue   what the great dog barked at  at such an hour  and what the old parrot said at such a time  the house and the garden I have exhausted my descriptive faculties on already  though  they are neither of them worth describing  and I was beginning to despair of matter to furnish out a quarter of an hour’s entertainment  when the scene began to brighten a little this auspicious day  by the arrival of a coach full of visitors  These were no other than a venerable dean  who is the minister of our parish  his lady and daughter  and a Mr Arnold  a gentleman who is a distant relation of lady Grimston’s  He has    a house in this neighbourhood  and is just come to an estate by the death of his elder brother   This visit has given me hopes that I may now and then have a chance for seeing a human face  besides the antiques of the family  and those which are depicted on the arras  Though not to disparage the people  they were all agreeable enough in their different ways  The old dean is good humoured and polite  I mean the true politeness  that of the heart  which dictates the most obliging things in so frank a manner  that they have not the least appearance of flattery  Being very near sighted  he put on a pair of spectacles to look at me  and turning to Mr Arnold  with a vivacity that would have become five and twenty  he repeated  ‘With an air and a face   And a shape and a grace   c ’  The young man smiled his assent  and my mother looked so delighted  that the good natured dean’s compliment pleased me for her sake  Lady Grimston  who is passionately fond of musick  has a very pretty organ in one of her chambers  Mr Arnold was requested to give us a lesson on it  which he very readily obliged us with  He plays ravishingly  the creature made me envious  he touched it so admirably  I had taken a sort of dislike to him when he first came in  I cannot tell you why or wherefore  but this accomplishment has reconciled me so to him  that I am half in love with him  I hope we shall see him often  he is really excellent on this instrument  and you know how fond I am of musick   August 15  This packet is already so large that I am sure it will frighten you  I will therefore send it off before I increase it  especially as I am now so much in the hum drum way  that I ought  out of policy  to make a break in my narrative  in order to encourage you to read it  Positively  if things do not mend  and that considerably too —Patty shall keep the journal  for I find myself already disposed to sleep over it   August 20  I have looked over what Patty has writ for the five last days  upon my word she is a very good journalist  as well as amanuensis  and she has given you  to the
