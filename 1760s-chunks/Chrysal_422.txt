  to my happiness will apologize for any seeming unpoliteness in it    I have for some time taken notice of the frequency of your visits   to my house  the honour of which I am justly sensible of  but not so   far dazzled by but I can see the motive of them through it   and   therefore must for many reasons beg leave to desire that you will   discontinue them          I â€” I â€” I don t understand you  sir     answered my master  a good   deal disconcerted at so unexpected an address    I have no motive   that I desire to conceal  or is any way inconsistent with the character   of a gentleman          Pardon me  sir    replied the other    I mean no such thing  But   yet  what may be thought consistent with that character in some   things  may be very inconsistent with the happiness of a father    To be plain  sir  I am not so unacquainted with the world but I   can see all your visits are paid to my daughter   and as she is    not upon a level with you  either in family or fortune  for a wife       Sir Charles Coote  K B   Davis s Olio           ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 511     I must repeat my request  that you will drop a pursuit which   must  therefore  have another view          You do injustice to your daughter    returned my master  recov    ered from his surprise  and convinced that it was in vain to   dissemble any longer    to say that she is not upon a level with   any man alive  I am above the vain pride of family   and as to   fortune  my own satisfies me  without hazarding my happiness to   seek for more          These     said the lady s father    are truly the sentiments of a   gentleman  nor have I any doubt of the sincerity with which you   declare them  But there are other considerations that make it    impossible to carry them into execution  You and my daughter pro    fess different principles of religion   and as I can by no means expect   that you should change yours  so  I hope  she is too firmly established   in hers  to quit them for any worldly honour or advantage        This was a stroke my master was not prepared for  He acquiesced    therefore  seemingly  with the best grace he could  to avoid entering   more explicitly into the subject  till he should have time to concert   measures for getting over this new diflBculty  for his honour was   now piqued  and he resolved to stop at nothing  if only to punish   the insolence of her father  in presuming to forbid him his house    Accordingly  after revolving a variety of schemes  he fixed upon   one which he thought could not fail  Big with this hope  he went   next morning to wait upon his mistress  notwithstanding the inter    diction of her father  and finding her alone  after some moments   of mutual confusion  on the circumstances of such a meeting    I â€”   I â€” I â€” I am come  madam    said my master  hesitating and blushing   as he spoke    I am come in consequence of what passed between   your father and me yesterday  of which I presume he has informed   you  It never was my design to disavow a passion  upon which   depends the happiness of my life  I only waited till some particular   circumstances should enable me to declare it with more convenience    But  as he has made the discovery  that reserve is no longer necessary    If therefore  madam  I can be so happy as to find favour in your   sight  all his objections  I presume  will be removed  by my offering   to marry you directly   on this sole condition  that our marriage   shall be kept inviolably secret  till I have accomplished some affairs    to which you must be sensible the difference of our religions would   be a prejudice  The ceremony shall be performed by any clergyman   you please  in the presence of your father  and any other witnesses   in whose secrecy we can confide  and every thing done that can   convince you of the sincerity and honour of my attachment  Speak   then  dearest madam  and make me happy  by complying with   a proposal that has your happiness in view equally with my own
