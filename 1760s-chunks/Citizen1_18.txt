his own blood as I was served  The majority of the assembly were pleased with this punishment  and were going to condemn him without further delay when the ox rose up to give his opinion  I am informed  says this counsellor  that the prisoner at the bar has left a wife with child behind him  By my knowledge in divination I foresee that this child will be a son  decrepid  feeble  sickly  a plague to himself and all about him  What say you then  my companions  if we condemn the father to animate the body of his own son  and by this means make him feel in himself those miseries his intemperance must otherwise have entailed upon his posterity  The whole court applauded the ingenuity of his torture  they thanked him for his advice  Kabul was driven once more to revisit the earth  and his soul in the body of his own son  passed a period of thirty years  loaded with misery  anxiety  and disease    LETTER XVI  From the same   I Know not whether I am more obliged to the Chinese missionaries for the instruction I have received from them  or prejudiced by the falshoods they have made me believe  By them I was told that the Pope was universally allowed to be a man    55 and placed at the head of the church  in England  however  they plainly prove him to be an whore in man s cloaths  and often burn him in effigy as an impostor  A thousand books have been written on either side of the question  priests are eternally disputing against each other  and those mouths that want argument are filled with abuse  Which party must I believe  or shall I give credit to neither  When I survey the absurdities and falsehoods with which the books of the Europeans are filled  I thank heaven for having been born in China  and that I have sagacity enough to detect imposture   The Europeans reproach us with false history and fabulous chronology  how should they blush to see their own books  many of which are written by the doctors of their religion filled with the most monstrous fables  and attested with the utmost solemnity  The bounds of a letter  do not permit me to mention all the absurdities of this kind  which in my reading I have met with  I shall confine myself to the accounts which some of their lettered men give of the persons of some of the inhabitants on our globe  And not satisfied with the most solemn asseverations  they sometimes pretend to have been eye witnesses of what they describe   A christian doctor in one of his principal performances   says  that it was not impossible for a whole nation to have but one eye in the middle of the forehead  He is not satisfied with leaving it in doubt  but in another work † assures us  that the fact was certain  and that he himself was an eye witness of it  When  says he  I took a journey   56 into Ethiopia in company with several other servants of Christ  in order to preach the gospel there  I beheld in the southern provinces of that country a nation which had only one eye in the midst of their foreheads   You will  no doubt  be surprized  reverend Fum  with this author s effrontery  but alas he is not alone in this story  he has only borrowed it from several others who wrote before him  Solinus creates another nation of Cyclops  the Arimaspians who inhabit those countries that border on the Caspian sea  This author goes on to tell us of a people of India  who have but one leg and one eye  and yet are extremely active  run with great swiftness  and live by hunting  These people we scarce know how to pity or admire  but the men whom Pliny calls Cynamolci  who have got the heads of dogs really deserve our compassion  Instead of language they express their sentiments by barking  Solinus confirms what Pliny mentions  and Simon Mayole  a French bishop  talks of them as of particular and familiar acquaintances  After passing the desarts of Egypt  says he  we meet with the Kunokephaloi  who inhabit those regions that border on Ethiopia  they live by hunting  they cannot speak  but whistle  their chins resemble a serpent s head  their hands are armed with long sharp claws  their breast resembles that of a greyhound  and they excel in swiftness and agility  Would you think it  my friend  that these odd kind of people are  notwithstanding their figure  excessively delicate  not even an alderman s wife  or Chinese mandarine  can excel them in this particular  These people  continues our faithful bishop  never refuse wine  love roast and boiled meat  they are particularly curious in having their meat well dressed  and spurn at it   57 if in the least tainted  When the Ptolemies reigned in Egypt  says he a little farther on  those men with dog s heads taught Grammar and Music  For men who had no voices to teach music  and who could not speak to teach grammar  is  I confess a little extraordinary  Did ever the disciples of Fohi broach any thing more ridiculous   Hitherto we have seen
