the inn on foot   he ordered some chocolate for breakfast  and at the desire of the  ladies  sent Pipes to see the horses fed  and the chariot prepared   while he went to the bar  and discharged the bill   These measures being taken  they set out about five o clock  and having  refreshed themselves and their cattle at another inn on the road   proceeded in the afternoon  Without meeting with any other accident   they safely arrived at the place of their destination  where Mrs   Gauntlet expressed her joy at seeing her old friend Mr  Pickle  whom   however  she kindly reproached for the long discontinuance of his  regard  Without explaining the cause of that interruption  he protested  that his love and esteem had never been discontinued  and that for the  future he should omit no occasion of testifying how much he had her  friendship at heart  She then made him acquainted with her son  who at  that time was in the house  being excused from his duty by furlough   This young man  whose name was Godfrey  was about the age of twenty  of  a middling size  vigorous make  remarkably well shaped  and the scars  of the small pox  of which he bore a good number  added a peculiar  manliness to the air of his countenance  His capacity was good  and his  disposition naturally frank and easy  but he had been a soldier from  his infancy  and his education was altogether in the military style   He looked upon taste and letters as mere pedantry  beneath the  consideration of a gentleman  and every civil station of life as mean   when compared with the profession of arms  He had made great progress in  the gymnastic sciences of dancing  fencing  and riding  played perfectly  well on the German flute  and  above all things valued himself upon a  scrupulous observance of all the points of honour   Had Peregrine and he considered themselves upon equal footing  in  all probability they would have immediately entered into a league of  intimacy and friendship  but this sufficient soldier looked upon his  sister s admirer as a young student raw from the university  and utterly  ignorant of mankind  while Squire Pickle beheld Godfrey in the light of  a needy volunteer  greatly inferior to himself in fortune  as well as  every other accomplishment  This mutual misunderstanding could not fail  of animosities  The very next day after Peregrine s arrival  some sharp  repartees passed between them in presence of the ladies  before whom  each endeavoured to assert his own superiority  In these contests our  hero never failed of obtaining the victory  because his genius was more  acute  and his talents better cultivated  than those of his antagonist   who therefore took umbrage at his success  became jealous of his  reputation  and began to treat him with marks of scorn and disrespect   His sister saw  and  dreading the consequence of his ferocity  not  only took him to task in private for his impolite behaviour  but  also entreated her lover to make allowances for the roughness of her  brother s education  He kindly assured her  that whatever pains it might  cost him to vanquish his own impetuous temper  he would  for her sake     6 22 15  3 45 PM   endure all the mortifications to which her brother s arrogance might  expose him  and  after having stayed with her two days  and enjoyed  several private interviews  during which he acted the part of a most  passionate lover  he took his leave of Mrs  Gauntlet overnight  and told  the young ladies he would call early next morning to bid them farewell   He did not neglect this piece of duty  and found the two friends and  breakfast already prepared in the parlour  All three being extremely  affected with the thoughts of parting  a most pathetic silence for some  time prevailed  till Peregrine put an end to it by lamenting his fate   in being obliged to exile himself so long from the dear object of his  most interesting wish  He begged  with the most earnest supplications   that she would now  in consideration of the cruel absence he must  suffer  give him the consolation which she had hitherto refused  namely   that of knowing he possessed a place within her heart  The confidante  seconded his request  representing that it was now no time to disguise  her sentiments  when her lover was about to leave the kingdom  and might  be in danger of contracting other connections  unless he was confirmed  in his constancy  by knowing how far he could depend upon her love  and   in short  she was plied with such irresistible importunities  that  she answered in the utmost confusion   Though I have avoided literal  acknowledgments  methinks the circumstances of my behaviour might  have convinced Mr  Pickle that I do not regard him as a common  acquaintance     My charming Emily   cried the impatient lover  throwing  himself at her feet   why will you
