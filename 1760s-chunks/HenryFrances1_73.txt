on Reason—therefore subject to Disquisition  I am extremely provoked at those  who justify the Superstitions and Impositions of the Priests  under the plausible Title of pious Frauds  which  with more Justice  I stile impious Falshoods  Must Truth then avail itself of Error   c   For I think it Blasphemy to affirm any Thing under the Sanction of Religion  which is not of divine Authority  either from Reason  which is the Deity within  or Revelation  its Manifestation without  If Montaigne s Reasoning is just  it was so from the Beginning  and must consequently have overlaid the Christian Religion in its Birth  His whole Argument  upon this Passage  might be shewn to be extremely weak  but that I should think it a Weakness to confute him  However  it is not owing to any   253 Want of Sense or Judgment in the Author  but to a certain Laziness in his Disposition  which did not suffer him to examine closely his own Opinions  but  after the Manner of an old Man  of which all his Writings are full  found it easier to talk than think   After his wild Manner he hops away  and flies into an Essay about the Rationality of Brutes  If the Schoolmen will not allow me this Expression  by tying me down to a certain Definition  I shall only answer them  by quoting a Criticism of Addison s upon Pope s Eclogues  that  if they are not Pastorals  they are something better  I think he has offered a great many very bold and clever Arguments on this Subject  which  tho  they do not prove the Matter  do  at least  put it out of the Power of those  who deny it  to prove the Contrary  His whole Design  thro  the Essay  is  by shewing the Insufficiency of human Understanding  to recommend to us our Dependence upon Faith  and  tho  there are few People  who are more inclined to a free and canvassed Disquisition of all Matters  even the most sacred  and most general received Opinions  than I have always been  yet the Arguments of Montaigne  deduced from the Writings of the wisest of the antient and modern Philosophers  have indeed put me out of Conceit with the vain Imaginations  and presumptuous Reasonings  of human Understanding     254It was said by some Writer  that the Being of a God was so far from a Matter of Doubt  that it was the only Thing of which we could be certain  The Essay  we are upon  furnishes sufficient Arguments to prove  how doubtful our Knowledge is in every Thing else  which resolves all Science into Faith  The highest Philosophy cannot give us Certainty on the most trifling Subjects  if therefore we know any Thing certainly  it must be from supernatural Aid   The whole Essay would be properly classed  by being bound up with the Moriae Encomium of Erasmus  only with this Difference  that Montaigne is in earnest  and Erasmus is in jest  But I like my Author best  because his is a philosophical Essay  the other  only an humorous Satire   Adeiu   LETTER CXXXII   Dear FANNY   I CAME hither in spight of very opposing Weather  Along the Road I perceived Marks of the violent Storm  and I found the great Sign and Half of the Stables of this Inn carried away by it  I beg  the first Account you hear of the Yacht  you will let me hear it   I amused myself  on the Way  with reflecting upon every Person  Circumstance  and Thing    255 which I parted from  at —  But the only Occasion I had to philosophize  was on little Jenny  for  from playing with the Child  I took a Hint to examine into an Opinion  which the World seems possessed with  and perhaps receive it upon Trust from one another  as they do a great many others  without inquiring philosophically into the Matter   I remember Mr  —  a Man of tender Affections  but withal a Person of excellent Understanding  playing one Day with a pretty Child of his own  said  that he was  ever since it was born  waiting for  and attending to that Impulse or Instinct  which is called natural Affection  but that all he could perceive was  that he loved it more and more from Use  as he had done other Peoples Children before   In short  when does this particular Attachment seize us  If it is natural  we should perceive it the Instant we heard the first Cry  but  at that Time  we know nothing of the Matter  If we are sensible of it some Time after  it is merely owing to that Habit  which Mr  — mentioned  to that Proteus of Nature  Custom  which has misled most of those Philosophers who have read Men and Manners  without having studied human Nature —which is pretending to Physics  without having learned Anatomy   But even the Instant the Child is born  would not the Parent rather your s should die than his  So he would your Horse  — The Love of Property   256 is natural  but this is Part of a general Partiality
