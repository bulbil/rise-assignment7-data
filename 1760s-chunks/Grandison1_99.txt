used him worse than she did any body else  But it was not her way to use any body ill  I saw that   Nevertheless he was resolved to strike a bold stroke for a wife  as were his words from the title of a play  And between us we settled the matter in one night  For I had found means to get out unknown to the family   It will be trespassing too much upon your honour s patience  to be very particular in our contrivances  I will be as brief as possible   My Lady was to go to a Masquerade  I got into the knowledge of every thing how and about it  The maids were as full of the matter as their master and mistresses   It was agreed to make the chairmen fuddled  Two of Mr  Merceda s footmen were to undertake the task  Brandy was put into their liquor to hasten them   They were soon overcome  The weather was cold  They drank briskly  and were laid up safe  I then hired two chance chairmen and gave them orders as had been contrived   I had twenty guineas given me in hand for my encouragement  in which were included the promised ten   I had  when I was my first master Bagenhall s clerk  made acquaintance with several clerks of the Custumhouse  particularly with one Awberry  a sober modest man  who has two sisters  to one of whom I am contracted  and always for two years past  intended to make my wife  as soon as I should be in any way to maintain her  The mother is a widow  All of them are very honest people   Mr  Awberry the brother being assured by me  and I was well assured of it myself  and had no doubt about it  that marriage was intended  and knowing Sir Hargrave s great estate  and having indeed seen Sir Hargrave on the occasion  and received his protestations   244 of honour  engaged his mother and sister in it  and the result  as to them and me  was  that I was to receive  as soon as the knot was tied  an hundred guineas besides the twenty  and moreover an absolute promise of a place  and twenty pounds a year till I got it  and then my marriage with young Mrs  Awberry was to follow   The widow has an annuity of thirty pounds  which  with their son s salary  keeps them above want   She lives at Paddington  There is a back door and garden  as it happens  convenient to bring any body in  or carry any body out  secretly  and hither it was resolved  if possible  that the lady should be brought  and a Fleet parson and his clerk ready station d  to perform the ceremony  and then all that the bridegroom wish d was to follow of course   Sir Hargrave doubted not  tho  he was fruitful in contrivances  and put many others in practice  but he should be detected if he carried the Lady to his own house  And as he was afraid that the chairmen  notwithstanding several other artful contrivances  would be able to find out the place they carried her to  he had ordered his chariot and six to be at the widow Awberry s by six in the morning  with three servants on horseback  armed  and a horse and pistols besides  After marriage and consummation  he was resolved to go to his house on the forest  but not to stay there  but to go to Mr  Merceda s house near Newberry  where he doubted not but he should be secret till he thought fit to produce the lady  as Lady Pollexfen  And often  very often  did he triumph on the victory he should obtain over her other Lovers  and over her own proud heart  as he would have it to be   The parson  Sir  came  The clerk was there  But what with fits  prayers  tears  and one thing or other  at one time the Lady being thought irrecoverable having received some unintended hurt in her struggling to get out of a door  as I heard it was  Sir   245 Hargrave in terror dismissed the parson  and resolved to carry the lady  who by that time was recovered  in the chariot to his seat at Windsor  and then  staying there only to marry  go to Newberry  And from thence break out by degrees  as the matter should be taken   My lady screamed  resisted  and did all that woman could do  to get free  And more than once people who heard her cry out for help were put on a wrong scent  And had we not met with your honour  who would see with your own eyes  and hear with your own ears  the affair had been all over in the way Sir Hargrave wished  and was at so much pains and expence to effect  For  Sir  the chariot generally drove so fast  that before passengers could have resolved whether to interfere or not  we should have been out of sight or reach   Sir Hargrave is in the greatest rage with us all  because we stood not better by him  He
