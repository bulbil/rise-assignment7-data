 strange that he could be so pleased  Prepossessed as I have been in your favour  observed he  I must own that you have surpassed my expectations  It is not merely the elegance and distinctness of the handwriting  There is something animated and glowing in the composition  You will do ample credit to my choice  and fully make up for the loss of your predecessor  He would not have cut my panegyric so short  if his nephew the Count de Lemos had not interrupted him in the middle of it  By the warmth and frequency of his excellency s welcome  it was evident that they were the best friends in the world  They were immediately closeted together on some family business  of which I shall speak in the sequel  The king s affairs at this time were obliged to play second to those of the minister   While they were caballing it struck twelve  As I knew that the secretaries and their clerks quitted office at that hour to go and dine wherever their business and desire should point them  I left my prize performance behind me  and went to the gayest tavern at the court end of the town  for I had nothing further to do with Monteser  who had paid my salary  and taken his leave of me  But a common eating house would have been a very improper place for me to be seen in   Consider yourself as to the very bone and marrow the king s   This metaphorical expression of the duke had given birth to a real and tangible ambition in my soul  which put forth shoots like a plantation in a fat and unvexed soil       CH  III     All is not gold that glitters  Some uneasiness resulting from the discovery of that principle in philosophy  and its practical application to existing circumstances   I TOOK especial care  on my first entrance  to instil into the tavern keeper s conception that I was secretary to the prime minister  nor was it easy  in that view of my rank and consequence  to order anything sufficiently sumptuous for dinner  To have selected from the bill of fare  might have looked as if I descended to the meanness of calculation  I therefore told him to send up the best the house afforded  My orders were punctually obeyed  and the anxious assiduity of the attendance pampered my fancy as much as the dishes did my palate  As to the bill  I had nothing to do with it but to pay it  Down went a pistole upon the table  and the waiters pocketed the difference  which was somewhat more than a quarter  After this display of grandeur I strutted out  practising those obstreperous clearings of the throat which announce  by empty sound  the approach of a substantial coxcomb   There was at the distance of twenty yards a large house with lodgings to let  principally frequented by foreign nobility  I rented at once a suite of apartments  consisting of five or six rooms elegantly furnished  From my style of living  any one would have thought I had two or three thousand ducats of yearly income  The first month was paid in advance  Afterwards I returned to business  and employed the whole afternoon in going on with what I had begun in the morning  In a closet adjoining mine there were two other secretaries  but their office was only to copy out fair  I got acquainted with them as we were shutting up for the evening  and  by way of smoothing the first overtures towards friendship  invited them home with me to my tavern  where I ordered the choicest delicacies of the season  with a profusion of the most exquisite wines   We sat down to table  and began bandying about more merriment than wit  for with all due deference to my guests  it was but too visible that they owed their official situations to any circumstance rather than to their abilities  They were adepts  it must be confessed  in all the history and mystery of scrivening and clerkship  but as for polite literature and university education  there was not even a suspicion of it in all their talk   To make amends for that defect  they had a keen eye to the main chance  and though sensible how high an honour it was to be on the prime minister s establishment  there were some dashes of acid in the cup of good fortune  It is now full five months  said one of them  that we have been serving at our own cost  We do not touch one farthing of salary  and  what is worst of all  our very board wages are shamefully in arrear  There is no knowing what footing we are upon  As for me  said the other  I would willingly be tied up to the halbert  and receive a percentage in lashes  for the liberty of changing my berth  but I dare not either take myself off or petition for my discharge  after having transcribed such state secrets as have passed under my inspection  I might chance to become too well acquainted with the tower of Segovia or the castle of Alicant   How do you manage for a subsistence  then  said I  You must of course have means of your own  These they represented as very slender
