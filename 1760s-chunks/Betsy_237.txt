him       He returned the embrace she gave  and joined his lips to hers with a   warmth which she had not for a long time experienced from him  a sudden   rush of transport came at once upon her with such force  that it   overwhelmed her spirits  and she fell into a kind of fainting between   his arms  He was frightened at the change he observed in her  and   hastily cutting the lacings of her stays  to give her air  the letter   above mentioned dropped from her breast upon the ground  He took it up    and was going to throw it upon the table  but in that action seeing the   name of Miss Harriot on the superscription  was struck with an   astonishment not easy to be conceived  He no longer thought of the   condition Miss Flora was in  but  tearing open the letter  he began to   examine the contents       Miss Flora in that instant recovering her senses  and the remembrance of   what had been concealed in her bosom  flew to him  endeavouring to   snatch the paper from his hands  but he had already seen too much not to   be determined to see the rest   Stand off   cried he  in a voice half   choaked with fury   I am not yet fully acquainted with the whole of the   favours you have bestowed upon me in this paper   Confounded as she was    cunning did not quite forsake her   I am ignorant of what it contains     said she   I found it in the street   It is not mine   I wrote it not        With such like vain pretences would she have pleaded innocence  yet all   the time endeavoured  with her whole strength  to force the proof of her   guilt from him  insomuch that  though he was very tall  he was obliged   with one hand to keep her off  and with the other to hold the paper at   arms length  while he was reading it  and could not forbear frequently   interrupting himself  to cast a look of contempt and rage on the   malicious authoress   Vile hypocrite   cried he  and then again  as he   got farther into the base invective   Thou fiend in female form        She now finding all was over  and seized with a sudden fit of frenzy  or   something like it  ran to his sword  which he had pulled off and laid in   the window  and was about to plunge it in her breast  He easily wrested   it from her  and  putting it by his side   O thou serpent   thou viper     cried he   If thou wert a man  thou shouldest not need to be thy own   executioner   The tide of her passion then turning another way  she   threw herself at his feet  clung round his legs  and  in a voice rather   screaming than speaking  uttered these words   O pardon me   pity me    Whatever I have done  my love of you occasioned it     Curse on such   poisonous love   rejoined he   Hell  and its worst effects  are in the   name  when mentioned by a mouth like thine   Then finding it a little   difficult to disentangle himself from the hold she had taken of him     Thou shame and scandal to that sex to which alone thou owest thy   safety   cried he furiously   quit me this instant  lest I forget thou   art a woman   lest I spurn thee from me  and use thee as the worst of   reptiles        On hearing these dreadful words  all her strength forsook her  the   sinews of her hand relaxed  and lost their grasp  She fell a second time   into a fainting fit  but of a nature as different from what the former   had been as were the emotions that occasioned it  Mr  Trueworth was now   too much and too justly irritated to be capable of relenting  he left   her in this condition  and only bid the people at the bar  as he went   out of the house  send somebody up to her assistance       The humour he was at present in rendering him altogether unfit for   company  he went directly to his lodgings  where examining the letter   with more attention than he could do before  he presently imagined he   was not altogether unacquainted with the hand writing  He very well knew   it was not that of Miss Flora  yet positive that he had somewhere seen   it before  that which he had received concerning Miss Betsy and the   child at Denham came fresh into his head
