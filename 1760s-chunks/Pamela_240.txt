  Simon   Ay  ay  said he  I thought you did not look so smirking upon   us for nothing   Well  then  Pamela  said my master  since your blushes   discover you  don t be ashamed  but confess the truth       Now  said Miss Darnford  I am quite angry  and  said Lady Darnford  I am   quite pleased  let me give you joy  dear madam  if it be so  And so   they all said  and saluted me all round   I was vexed it was before Mrs    Jewkes  for she shook her fat sides  and seemed highly pleased to be a   means of discovering it       Nobody  said my master  wishes me joy  No  said Lady Jones  very   obligingly  nobody need  for  with such a peerless spouse  you want no   good wishes   And he saluted them  and when he came last to me  said    before them all  Now  my sweet bride  my Pamela  let me conclude with   you  for here I began to love  and here I desire to end loving  but not   till my life ends       This was sweetly said  and taken great notice of  and it was doing   credit to his own generous choice  and vastly more than I merited       But I was forced to stand many more jokes afterwards  For Sir Simon   said  several times  Come  come  madam  now you are become one of us  I   shall be a little less scrupulous than I have been  I ll assure you       When we came in to dinner  I made no difficulty of what all offered me    the upper end of the table  and performed the honours of it with pretty   tolerable presence of mind  considering  And  with much ado  my good   benefactor promising to be down again before winter  we got off the   ball  but appointed Tuesday evening  at Lady Darnford s  to take leave   of all this good company  who promised to be there  my master designing   to set out on Wednesday morning for Bedfordshire       We had prayers in the little chapel  in the afternoon  but they all   wished for the good clerk again  with great encomiums upon you  my dear   father  and the company staid supper also  and departed exceeding well   satisfied  and with abundance of wishes for the continuance of our   mutual happiness  and my master desired Mr  Peters to answer for him to   the ringers at the town  if they should hear of it  till our return into   this country  and that then he would be bountiful to them  because he   would not publicly declare it till he had first done so in Bedfordshire          Monday  the fifth day       I have had very little of my dear friend s company this day  for he   only staid breakfast with me  and rode out to see a sick gentleman about   eighteen miles off  who begged  by a man and horse on purpose  to speak   with him  believing he should not recover  and upon part of whose estate   my master has a mortgage  He said  My dearest  I shall be very uneasy    if I am obliged to tarry all night from you  but  lest you should be   alarmed  if I don t come home by ten  don t expect me  For poor Mr    Carlton and I have pretty large concerns together  and if he should be   very ill  and would be comforted by my presence   as I know he loves me    and his family will be more in my power  if he dies  than I wish for     charity will not let me refuse       It is now ten o clock at night  and I fear he will not return  I fear    for the sake of his poor sick friend  who  I doubt  is worse  Though I   know not the gentleman  I am sorry for his own sake  for his family s   sake  and for my dear master s sake  who  by his kind expressions  I   find  loves him  And  methinks  I should be sorry any grief should touch   his generous heart  though yet there is no living in this world  without   too many occasions for concern  even in the most prosperous state  And   it is fit it should be so  or else  poor wretches  as we are  we should   look no farther  but be like sensual travellers on a journey homeward    who  meeting with good
