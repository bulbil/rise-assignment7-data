   or rather of universal  beneficence  But my Harry here has youth   enough  with an abundance of benevolence also for the purpose     and I recommend it to him as the greatest of charities  a charity   to Great Britain  a charity to mankind  What would you think    my lord  said Harry  of my expending your whole drawer of gold   upon this business   Great as it is  it would be but a small matter   toward the value of purchasing peace upon earth  and the sons   of peace upon earth will be likeliest to be the sons of love in   heaven  So that we cannot lay out our money to better advantage   in any purchase for the benefit of the brothers of our own frailty      Alas  my love   rejoined Mr  Meekly  though you were master   of half the wealth of the people of England  and were willing to   employ the whole for their emolument in this way  the people   themselves would oppose you in every step you should take  Some   would be too proud to accept a benefit from you  Others would   tell you that no man should dare to violate their property with   either spade or pickaxe  and others would indict you even for   treading on their grounds  Nothing less than the act of the whole   legislature  to whom the people have committed their confluent   powers  can avail for an undertaking of such national import      Then  my dear Mr  Meekly  be pleased to let me have in writing     Au2         356 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      what you have already set forth on this head   and if I live to   come to the lower house of parliament  I will bend all my powers   to this capital charity  And  if no other oratory will avail for   the purpose  I will bribe the members with a hundred thousand   pounds  and corrupt them  if possible  into one act of patriotism     But  Mr  Meekly  I interrupt you  Pray  proceed in your narrative      On my return to Amsterdam  I grew affected one evening   in a manner I had never before experienced  I did not feel myself   any way sick or in pain  and yet I wished to exchange my sensa    tions for any other species of malady  I was wholly pervaded by   a gloomy despondence  I looked abroad for comfort  but it was   nowhere to be found  every object gave disgust to my discon    tented imagination  I secretly inquired of my soul  if riches    honours  dignities  if the empire of the world would restore her   to joy   but she turned from them  and said All these things are   strangers and aliens to my peace  Alas   said T  tell me then where   your peace may be found   I know not  she replied   but I feel   that I am wretched      For three clays I continued under this oppression of spirit   and   on the third night an increasing horror of deep and heavy darkness   fell upon me  All hope died within me  and misery seemed to   open a gulf of ever deepening destruction in my soul  I lay all   night bathed in drops of unutterable anguish  I wished and   struggled to arise and change my situation  but I felt that my   mind was its own place  and its own hell  from whence there was   no removal  no possible escape      I now concluded that  somehow  I must have sinned beyond the   measure of all sinners  since my damnation was deeper than that   of any other  I therefore turned toward God and wished to repent     but  as I did not feel conviction for the sins of which I accused   myself  no place for repentance was found in my soul      Tremendous author   I cried  I find that thou canst sink and slay   at pleasure   but canst thou not also raise up and make alive   If   all things have their existence in thee  O God   is it not near and   easy unto thee to impart to us some sensation of thine own exist    ence also  some sensation of thine own peace  the sense that it   is thou alone who canst be our sustainer  Save me  Jesus  save   me from the hell of mine own nature  Save me  thou Son of   David   save me from myself       While I thus prayed in an agony  my whole frame was suddenly   overpowered  and sunk  as I suppose  into a state of insensibility
