says   My husband  though he is become a blackguard jail bird  must be allowed to be a handsome fellow still  —On the other hand  he will frequently desire me to take notice of his rib  as she chances to pass — Mind that draggle tailed drunken drab   he will say   what an antidote it is—yet  for all that  Felton  she was a fine woman when I married her—Poor Bess  I have been the ruin of her  that is certain  and deserve to be d—ned for bringing her to this pass     Thus they accommodate themselves to each other s infirmities  and pass their time not without some taste of plebeian enjoyment—but  name their child  they never fail to burst into tears  and still feel a return of the most poignant sorrow    Sir Launcelot Greaves did not hear this story unmoved  Tom Clarke s cheeks were bedewed with the drops of sympathy  while  with much sobbing  he declared his opinion  that an action should lie against the lady s father   Captain Crowe having listened to the story with uncommon attention  expressed his concern that an honest seaman should be so taken in stays  but he imputed all his calamities to the wife   For why   said he   a seafaring man may have a sweetheart in every port  but he should steer clear of a wife  as he would avoid a quicksand —You see  brother  how this here Clewline lags astern in the wake of a snivelling b— h  otherwise he would never make a weft in his ensign for the loss of a child—odds heart  he could have done no more if he had sprung a top mast  or started a timber    The knight declaring that he would take another view of the prison in the afternoon  Mr  Felton insisted upon his doing him the honour to drink a dish of tea in his apartment  and Sir Launcelot accepted his invitation  Thither they  accordingly repaired  after having made another circuit of the jail  and the tea things were produced by Mrs  Felton  when she was summoned to the door  and in a few minutes returning  communicated something in a whisper to her husband  He changed colour  and repaired to the staircase  where he was heard to talk aloud in an angry tone   When he came back  he told the company he had been teased by a very importunate beggar  Addressing himself to our adventurer   You took notice   says he   of a fine lady flaunting about our walk in all the frippery of the fashion  She was lately a gay young widow that made a great figure at the court end of the town  she distinguished herself by her splendid equipage  her rich liveries  her brilliant assemblies  her numerous routs  and her elegant taste in dress and furniture  She is nearly related to some of the best families in England  and  it must be owned  mistress of many fine accomplishments  But being deficient in true delicacy  she endeavoured to hide that defect by affectation  She pretended to a thousand antipathies which did not belong to her nature  A breast of veal threw her into mortal agonies  if she saw a spider  she screamed  and at sight of a mouse she fainted away  She could not  without horror  behold an entire joint of meat  and nothing but fricassees and other made dishes were seen upon her table  She caused all her floors to be lined with green baize  that she might trip along there with more ease and pleasure  Her footmen wore clogs  which were deposited in the hall  and both they and her chairmen were laid under the strongest injunctions to avoid porter and tobacco  Her jointure amounted to eight hundred pounds per annum  and she made shift to spend four times that sum  At length it was mortgaged for nearly the entire value  but  far from retrenching  she seemed to increase in extravagance  until her effects were taken in execution  and her person here deposited in safe custody    When one considers the abrupt transition she underwent from her spacious apartments to an hovel scarce eight feet square  from sumptuous furniture to bare benches  from magnificence to meanness  from affluence to extreme poverty  one would imagine she must have been totally overwhelmed by such a sudden gush of misery  But this was not the case  She has  in fact  no delicate feelings  She forthwith accommodated herself to the exigency of her fortune  yet she still affects to keep state amidst the miseries of a jail  and this affectation is truly ridiculous  She lies a bed till two o clock in the afternoon  She maintains a female attendant for the sole purpose of dressing her person  Her cabin is the least cleanly in the whole prison  she has learned to eat bread and cheese and drink porter  but she always appears once a day dressed in the pink of the fashion  She has found means to run in debt at the chandler s shop  the baker s  and the tap house  though there is nothing got in this place but with ready money  She has even borrowed small sums from divers prisoners  who were themselves on the brink of
