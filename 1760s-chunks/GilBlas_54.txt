 You may enter into partnership at once  by keeping the books in the morning  and going out to visit patients in the afternoon  While I dose the nobility and clergy  you shall labour in your vocation among the lower orders  and when you have felt your ground a little  I will get you admitted into our body  You are a philosopher  Gil Blas  though you have never graduated  the common herd of them  though they have graduated in due form and order  are likely to run out the length of their tether without knowing their right hand from their left   I thanked the doctor for having so speedily enabled me to serve as his deputy  and  by way of acknowledging his goodness  promised to follow his system to the end of my career  with a magnanimous indifference about the aphorisms of Hippocrates  But that engagement was not to be taken to the letter  This tender attachment to water went against the grain  and I had a scheme for drinking wine every day snugly among the patients  I left off wearing my own suit a second time  to take up one of my master s  and look like an inveterate practitioner  After which I brought my medical theories into play  leaving them to look to the event whom it might concern  I began on an alguazil in a pleurisy  he was condemned to be bled with the utmost rigour of the law  at the same time that the system was to be replenished copiously with water  Next I made a lodgment in the veins of a gouty pastry cook  who roared like a lion by reason of gouty spasms  I stood on no more ceremony with his blood than with that of the alguazil  and laid no restriction on his taste for simple liquids  My prescriptions brought me in twelve rials  an incident so auspicious in my professional career  that I only wished for the plagues of Egypt on all the hale subjects of Valladolid  As I was coming out of the pastry cook s whom should I meet but Fabricio  a total stranger since the death of the licentiate SÃ©dillo  He looked at me with astonishment for some seconds  then set up a laugh with all his might  and held his sides  He had no reason to be grave  for I had a cloak trailing on the ground  with a doublet and breeches of four times my natural dimensions  I was certainly a complete original  I suffered him to make merry as long as he liked  and could scarcely help joining in the ridicule  but I kept a guard on my muscles to preserve a becoming dignity in public  and the better to enact the physician  whose part in society is not that of a buffoon  If the absurdity of my appearance excited Fabricio s merriment  my affected gravity added zest to it  and when he had nearly exhausted his lungs    By all the powers  Gil Blas  quoth he  thou art in complete masquerade  Who the devil has dressed you up in this manner  Fair and softly  my friend  replied I  fair and softly  be a little on your good behaviour with a modern Hippocrates  Understand me to be the substitute of Doctor Sangrado  the most eminent physician in Valladolid  I have lived with him these three weeks  He has bottomed me thoroughly in medicine  and  as he cannot perform the obsequies of all the patients who send for him  I visit a part of them to take the burden off his conscience  He does execution in great families  I among the vulgar  Vastly well  replied Fabricio  that is to say  he grants you a lease on the blood of the commonalty  but keeps to himself the fee simple of the fashionable world  I wish you joy of your lot  it is a pleasanter line of practice among the populace than among great folk  Long live a snug connection in the suburbs  a man s mistakes are easily buried  and his murders elude all but God s revenge  Yes  my brave boy  your destiny is truly enviable  in the language of Alexander  were I not Fabricio  I could wish to be Gil Blas   To show the son of Nunez  the barber  that he was not much out in his reckoning on my present happiness  I chinked the fees of the alguazil and the pastry cook  and this was followed by an adjournment to a tavern  to drink to their perfect recovery  The wine was very fair  and my impatience for the well known smack made me think it better than it was  I took some good long draughts  and without gainsaying the Latin oracle  in proportion as I poured it into its natural reservoir  I felt my accommodating entrails to owe me no grudge for the hard service into which I pressed them  As for Fabricio and myself  we sat some time in the tavern  making merry at the expense of our masters  as servants are too much accustomed to do  At last  seeing the night approach  we parted  after engaging to meet at the same place on the following day after dinner       CH  IV     Gil Blas goes on practising physic with equal success and ability
