 I am poor  low  silly  weak—Was I ever insolent  Was I ever saucy  Was I ever—O my uncle  hide my faults  I am mortified  Let me not reproach myself with having deserved mortification  If I did  I knew it not  I intended not to be saucy  vain  insolent—And if I was so  lay it to a flow of health  and good spirits  to time of life  young  gay  and priding myself in every one s love  yet most in the love  in the fond indulgence  of all you my good friends  And then you will have some of my faults to lay at your own doors  nor will you  even you  my uncle  be clear of reproach  because your correction was always mingled with so much praise  that I thought you were but at play with your niece  and that you levelled your blame more at the Sex than at your Harriet   BUT what have I written against myself  I believe I am not such a low  silly  weak creature  as I had thought myself  For just as I had laid down my pen with a pensive air  and to look into the state of my own heart  in order either to lighten  or to confirm  the self blame I had so glibly written down  Lady L  in her chair  made us a visit  She came up directly to me  I am come to dine with your cousins and you    97 Miss Byron  said she  Shall I be welcome  But don t answer me  I know I shall   Mrs  Reeves enter d  and acknowledged the favour   Sir Hargrave Pollexfen  and some of his brethren  are to dine with my brother  said my Lady  and I  not being obliged to do the honours of the table  with my Lord s consent  made my escape  I cannot endure the wretch who could make such a vile attempt upon you  and who might have murder d my brother —Come  will you let me see what you are writeing  You can forgive Charlotte s freedom  Will you excuse her sister s   I cannot shew your Ladyship all I have written  but I will read you some passages of the long letter before me   I told her my subject  and read to her such as I thought I could read  She raved at Sir Hargrave  Wonder d he had the confidence to approach me  especially with hope  She prais d me  Yet said to my cousin Reeves  that he ought to have been denied the house  and the rather  as I was myself very unwilling to see him   I own  I thought so too  Both my cousins are too good natur d   We had a great deal of talk about the duel that was to happily prevented  Lady L  gave us an account of the unhappy one which her father fought  and to the issue of which they owed the loss of the best of mothers  And at and after dinner she piously expatiated on the excellencies of that mother  and demonstrated  what I have often thought of great consequence  my grandmamma s and aunt Selby s examples before me affording the noblest proofs  that the conduct of women in their families is of high importance  and that they need not to look out of them so often as they do  to employ themselves  and that not only in the most useful  but in the most delightful manner     98 My Lord L  having broke from the company at Sir Charles s  did us the honour to drink tea with us  Every thing  he said  passed very agreeably among the gentlemen he had left  and it was his opinion  that his brother s noble behaviour  and the conversation that passed at table  and in which he left him and them engaged  would make more than one convert among them   He told Lady L  that Sir Charles was to set out on Monday for Canterbury  For Canterbury  Lucy    and that he should take it for a favour  if she would give him her company for a few days to Colnebrooke  Their house in Brook street  he said  would be ready to receive them in a week s time  It wanted nothing but a thorough airing  And if  said he  you could prevail upon Miss Grandison to be with us till her brother returns  and both sisters could induce Miss Byron to make a fourth  we shall be  said he  the happiest party in the world  and perhaps may get Sir Charles among us  on his return  for a day or two  I bowed   I must tell you  my Lord  that Charlotte and I thought to offer our attendance on Miss Byron to some of the public entertainments  But your Lordship s pleasure shall determine me  and if we could be so happy as to have Miss Byron for our guest  I am sure of my sister  and it would be my preferable wish  Mr  Reeves  Mrs  Reeves  will you spare Miss Byron to me   I looked  as if for their leave
