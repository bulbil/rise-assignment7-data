where he had appointed   232 me  and observed that no man possessed of generosity and compassion  would have any objection to it  considering my birth and talents  and the misfortunes I had of late so unjustly undergone —This was touching Mr  Morgan on the right key  who protested with great earnestness  that he had no objection to my being received in the mess  but only complained  that the ceremony of asking his consent was not observed    As for a shentleman in distress  said he  shaking me by the hand  I lofe him as I lofe my own powels  For Got help me  I have had vexations enough upon my own pack  —  And as I afterwards learned  in so saying he spoke no more than what was true  for he had been once settled in a very good situation in Glamorganshire  and was ruined by being security for an acquaintance —All differences being composed  he united his bundle  which consisted of three bunches of onions  and a great lump of Cheshire cheese wrapt up in a handkerchief  and taking some biscuit from the cupboard  fell to with a keen appetite  inviting us to a share of the repast —When he had fed heartily on this homely fare  he filled a large cup made of a cocoa nut shell  with brandy  and drinking it off  told us    Prandy was the best menstruum for onion and sheese  —  His hunger being appeased  he began to shew a great deal of good humour  and being inquisitive about my birth  no sooner understood that I was descended of a good family  then he discovered a particular good will to me on that account  deducing his own pedigree in a direct line from the famous Caractacus king of the Britons  who was first the prisoner and afterwards the friend of Claudius Caesar —   233 Perceiving how much I was reduced in point of linnen  he made me a present of two good ruffled shirts  which with two of check Mr  Thomson gave me  enabled me to appear with decency —Mean while the sailor  whom Mr  Morgan had sent to the doctor  brought a prescription for his mess mate  which when Mr  Welchman had read  he got up to prepare it  and asked if the man was  Tead or alive  —   Dead   replied Jack  if he was dead he would have no occasion for doctor s stuff —No  thank God  death has n t as yet boarded him  but they have been yard arm and yard arm these three glasses  —   Are his eyes open   continued the mate   —   His starboard eye  said the sailor  is open  but fast jamm d in his head  and the haulyards of his underjaw are given way  —   Passion of my heart   cried Morgan  the man is as pad as one would desire in a summer s day —Did you feel his pulses   To this  the other replied with   Anan  —  Upon which this Cambro Briton  with great earnestness and humanity  ordered the tar to run to his mess mate and keep him alive till he should come with the medicine    and then  said he  you shall peradventure  pehold what you shall see  —  The poor fellow with great simplicity ran to the place where the sick man lay  but in less than a minute  returned with a woful countenance  and told us his comrade had struck  Morgan hearing this  exclaimed    Mercy upon my salfation  why did you not stop him till I came  —   Stop him  said the other  I hailed him several times  but he was too far on his way  and the enemy had got possession of his close quarters  so that he did not mind me  —    234   Well  well   said he  we all owe heaven a Teath —Go your ways  you ragamuffin  and take an example and a warning  look you  and repent of your misteets  —  So saying  he pushed the seamen out of the birth     While he entertained us with reflections suitable to this event  we heard the boatswain pipe to dinner  and immediately the boy belonging to our mess  run to the locker  from whence he carried off a large wooden platter  and in a few minutes  returned with it full of boiled peas  crying     Scaldings    all the way as he came —The cloath  consisting of a piece of an old sail  was instantly laid  covered with three plates  which by the colour  I could with difficulty discern to be metal  and as many spoons of the same composition  two of which were curtailed in the handles  and the other in the lip  Mr  Morgan himself enriched this mess with a lump of salt butter  scooped from an old gallipot  and a handful of onions shorn  with some pounded pepper —I was not very much tempted with the appearance of this dish  of which  nevertheless  my mess mates eat heartily  advising me to follow their example  as it was banyan day
