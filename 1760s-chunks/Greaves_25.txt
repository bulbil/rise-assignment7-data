had thus distinguished  eyeing him with a look of the most emphatic malevolence  told him it was very natural for a knave to dream of Newgate  and that he hoped to see the day when his dream would be found a true prophecy  and the commonwealth purged of all such rogues and vagabonds  But it could not be expected that the vulgar would be honest and conscientious  while the great were distinguished by profligacy and corruption  The squire was disposed to make a practical reply to this insinuation  when Mr  Ferret prudently withdrew himself from the scene of altercation  The good woman of the house persuaded his antagonist to take out his nap  assuring him that the eggs and bacon  with a mug of excellent ale  should be forthcoming in due season  The affair being thus fortunately adjusted  the guests returned to the kitchen  and Mr  Clarke resumed his story to this effect —   You ll please to take notice  gemmen  that  besides the instances I have alleged of Sir Launcelot s extravagant benevolence  I could recount a great many others of the same nature  and particularly the laudable vengeance he took of a country lawyer  I m sorry that any such miscreant should belong to the profession  He was clerk of the assize  gemmen  in a certain town  not a great way distant  and having a blank pardon left by the judges for some criminals whose cases were attended with favourable circumstances  he would not insert the name of one who could not procure a guinea for the fee  and the poor fellow  who had only stole an hour glass out of a shoemaker s window  was actually executed  after a long respite  during which he had been permitted to go abroad  and earn his subsistence by his daily labour    Sir Launcelot being informed of this barbarous act of avarice  and having some ground that bordered on the lawyer s estate  not only rendered him contemptible and infamous  by exposing him as often as they met on the grand jury  but also  being vested with the property of the great tithe  proved such a troublesome neighbour  sometimes by making waste among his hay and corn  sometimes by instituting suits against him for petty trespasses  that he was fairly obliged to quit his habitation  and remove into another part of the kingdom    All these avocations could not divert Sir Launcelot from the execution of a wild scheme  which has carried his extravagance to such a pitch that I am afraid  if a statute—you understand me  gemmen—were sued  the jury would—I don t choose to explain myself further on this circumstance  Be that as it may  the servants at Greavesbury Hall were not a little confounded  when their master took down from the family armoury a complete suit of armour  which belonged to his great grandfather  Sir Marmaduke Greaves  a great warrior  who lost his life in the service of his king  This armour being scoured  repaired  and altered  so as to fit Sir Launcelot  a certain knight  whom I don t choose to name  because I believe he cannot be proved compos mentis  came down  seemingly on a visit  with two attendants  and  on the evening of the festival of St  George  the armour being carried into the chapel  Sir Launcelot  Lord have mercy upon us   remained all night in that dismal place alone  and without light  though it was confidently reported all over the country  that the place was haunted by the spirit of his great great uncle  who  being lunatic  had cut his throat from ear to ear  and was found dead on the communion table    It was observed  that while Mr  Clarke rehearsed this circumstance his eyes began to stare and his teeth to chatter  while Dolly  whose looks were fixed invariably on this narrator  growing pale  and hitching her joint stool nearer the chimney  exclaimed  in a frightened tone   Moother  moother  in the neame of God  look to  un  how a quakes  as I m a precious saoul  a looks as if a saw something   Tom forced a smile  and thus proceeded —   While Sir Launcelot tarried within the chapel  with the doors all locked  the other knight stalked round and round it on the outside  with his sword drawn  to the terror of divers persons who were present at the ceremony  As soon as day broke he opened one of the doors  and going in to Sir Launcelot  read a book for some time  which we did suppose to be the constitutions of knight errantry  Then we heard a loud slap  which echoed through the whole chapel  and the stranger pronounce  with an audible and solemn voice   In the name of God  St  Michael  and St  George  I dub thee knight—be faithful  bold  and fortunate   You cannot imagine  gemmen  what an effect this strange ceremony had upon the people who were assembled  They gazed at one another in silent horror  and when Sir Launcelot came forth completely armed  took to their heels in a body  and fled with the utmost precipitation  I myself was overturned in the crowd  and this
