at all considerable   But this hindered not Sir Hargrave from being even noisy in his applauses  He would have it  that I must know a vast deal  because I happened to touch upon some things that had not taken his attention  He drowned the voice of Mr  Walden  who two or three times was earnest to speak  but not finding himself heard  drew up his mouth as if to a contemptuous whistle  shrugg d his shoulders  and sat collected in his own conscious worthiness  His eyes  however  were often cast upon the pictures that hung round the room  as much better objects than the living ones before him   But what extremely disconcerted me  was  a freedom of Miss Barnevelt s  taken upon what I last said  and upon Mr  Walden s hesitation  and Sir Hargrave s applauses  She prosessed that I was able to bring her own  75Sex into reputation with her  Wisdom  as I call it  said she  notwithstanding what you have modestly alleged to depreciate your own  proceeding thro teeth of ivory  and lips of coral  give a grace to every word  And then clasping one of her mannish arms round me  she kissed my cheek   I was surprised  and offended  and with the more reason  as Sir Hargrave  rising from his seat  declared  that since merit was to be approved in that manner  he thought himself obliged to follow so good an example   I stood up  and said  Surely  Sir  my compliance with the request of the company  too much I fear at my own expence  calls rather for civility than freedom  from a gentleman  I beg  Sir Hargrave—There I stopt  and I am sure looked greatly in earnest   He stood suspended till I had speaking  and then  bowing  sat down again  but  as Mr  Reeves told me afterwards  he whispered a great oath in his ear  and declared  that he beheld with transport his future wife  and cursed himself if he would ever have another  vowing  in the same whisper  that were a thousand men to stand in his way  he would not scruple any means to remove them   Miss Barnevelt only laughed at the freedom she had taken with me  She is a loud and fearless laugher  She hardly knows how to smile  For as soon as anything catches her fancy  her voice immediately bursts her lips  and widens her mouth to its full extent—Forgive me  Lucy  I believe I am spiteful   Lady Betty and Miss Clements  in low voices  praised me for my presence of mind  as they called it  in checking Sir Hargrave s forwardness   Just here  Lucy  I laid down my pen  and stept to the glass  to see whether I could not please myself with a wise frown or two  at least with a solemnity of countenance  that  occasionally  I might dash with it my childishness of look  which certainly encouraged   76 this freedom of Miss Barnevelt  But I could not please myself  My muscles have never been used to any thing but smiling  So favoured  so beloved  by every one of my dear friends  an heart so grateful for all their favours—How can I learn now to frown  or even long to look grave   All this time the scholar sat uneasily careless  Can you connect together  my Lucy  ideas so very different as these two words joined will give you   In the mean time Mr  Reeves  having sent for from his study  Bishop Burnet s History of his own Times  said he would  by way of moderatorship in the present debate  read them a passage  to which he believed all parties would subscribe  And then read what I will transcribe for you from the conclusion to that performance      I have often thought it a great error to waste young gentlemens years so long in learning Latin  by so tedious a grammar  I know those who are bred to the profession in literature  must have the Latin correctly  and for that the rules of grammar are necessary  But these rules are not at all requisite to those  who need only so much Latin  as thoroughly to understand and delight in the Roman authors and poets  But suppose a youth had  either for want of memory  or of application  an incurable a version to Latin  his education is not for that to be despaired of  There is much noble knowlege to be had in the English and French languages  Geography  History  chiefly that of our own country  the knowlege of Nature  and the more practical parts of the Mathematics  if he has not a genius for the demonstrative  may make a gentleman very knowing  tho  he has not a word of Latin   And why  I would fain know  said Mr  Reeves  not a gentlewoman    There is a fineness of thought  and a nobleness of expression  indeed  in the Latin authors   This makes for your argument  Mr  Walden   that will make   77 them the entertainment of a man s whole life  if he once understands and
