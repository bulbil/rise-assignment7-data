 Mar  29   I Inclose  my Lucy  the doctor s third pacquet  From its contents you will pity Sir Charles  as well as Clementina  and if you enter impartially into the situation of the family  and allow as much to their zeal for a religion they are satisfied with  as you will do for Sir Charles s steadiness in his  you will also pity them  They are all good  they are all considerate  A great deal is to be said for them  tho  much more   253 for Sir Charles  who insisted not upon that change of religion in the Lady  which they demanded from him   How great does he appear in my eyes  A confessor  tho  not a martyr  one may call him  for his religion and country—How deep was his distress  A mind so delicate as his  and wishing for the sake of the Sex  and the Lady and Family  as he did  rather to be repulsed by them  than to be obliged himself to decline their intended favour   You will admire the Lady in her sweetly modest behaviour  on his first visit before her mother  but more  for the noble spirit she endeavoured to resume in her conversation with him in the garden   But how great will he appear in your eyes  in the eyes of my grandmother  and aunt Selby  for that noble apostrophe —   But  O my Religion and my Country  I cannot  cannot  renounce you  What can this short life promise  what can it give  to warrant such a sacrifice      Yet her conduct  you will find  is not inferior to his  firmly persuaded  as she is  of the truth of her religion  and loving him with an ardor that he had from the first restrained in himself from hopelessness   But to admire her as she deserves  I should transcribe all she says  and his account of her whole behaviour   O my dear  Who could have acted as Clementina acted —Not  I fear   Your HARRIET BYRON   Dr  Bartlett s third Letter   YOUR sixth command  madam  is    To give you the particulars of Mr  Grandison s reception from the Marchioness and her Clementina  on his return to Bologna from Vienna  at the invitation of Signor Jeronymo     Mr  Grandison was received at his arrival with   254 great tokens of esteem and friendship  by the Marquis himself  and by the Bishop   Signor Jeronymo  who still kept his chamber  the introducer being withdrawn  embraced him  And now  said he  is the affair  that I have had so long in view  determined upon  O Chevalier  you will be a happy man  Clementina will be yours  You will be Clementina s  And now indeed do I embrace my brother—But I detain you not  Go to the happy girl  She is with her mother  and both are ready to receive and welcome you  Allow for the gentle spirit  She will not be able to say half she thinks   Camilla then appeared  to conduct me  says Mr  Grandison  to her Ladies  in the Marchioness s drawing room  She whispered me in the passage  Welcome  thrice welcome  best of men  Now will you be rewarded for all your goodness   I found the Marchioness sitting at her toilette  richly dressed  as in ceremony  but without attendants  even Camilla retired  as soon as she had opened the door for me   The lovely Clementina stood at the back of her mother s chair  She was elegantly dressed  But her natural modesty  heightened by a glowing consciousness  that seemed to arise from the occasion  gave her advantages that her richest jewels could not have given her   The Marchioness stood up  I kissed her hand—You are welcome  Chevalier  said she  The only man on earth that I could thus welcome  or is fit to be so welcomed —Clementina  my dear —turning round  and taking her hand   The young Lady had shrunk back  her complexion varying  now glowing  now pale—Excuse her voice  said the condescending mother  her heart bids you welcome   Judge for me  my dear Dr  Bartlett  how I must be affected at this gracious reception  I  who knew   255 not the terms that were to be prescribed to me     Spare me  dear Lady  thought I  spare me my Conscience  and take all the world s wealth and glory to yourselves  I shall be rich enough with Clementina      The Marchioness seated her in her own chair  I approached her  But how could I with that grateful ardor  that  but for my doubts  would have sprung to my lips  Modest Love  however  was attributed to me  and I had the praise wholly for that which was but partly due to it   I drew a chair for the Marchioness  and  at her command  another for myself  The mother took one hand of her bashful daughter  I presumed to take the other  The amiable Lady held down her blushing
