he has   no manner of interest in  The podestat answered  it was unavoidable    because as the person  who said he was her husband  had accused her of   an elopement  there was all the reason in the world to suppose that if   it were so  it was in favour of this gentleman  by the rage he was   informed he had testified at finding him in Padua       Louisa gave only a scornful smile  denoting how much she disdained a   crime of the nature she was suspected of  and followed one of the   officers  who conducted her to the place appointed for her confinement       Monsieur du Plessis was touched to the soul at the indignity he thought   offered to this sovereign of his affections  but he restrained himself   when he considered that it had the sanction of law  which in all nations   must be submitted to  and he only told the podestat  that the virtue of   that lady would soon be cleared  to the confusion of those who had   presumed to traduce it       As  after they were under confinement  they had no opportunity of   advising each other what to do  monsieur du Plessis  uneasy at the   injustice done him  wrote immediately to the prince of Conti  in   these terms        To his Royal Highness the Prince of  CONTI           It is with the extremest reluctance I give   your royal highness this trouble  or find myself   obliged to accuse the count de Bellfleur of   an action so dishonourable to our nation  but   as I am here under confinement for preventing   him from committing a rape on a young English   lady  who failing to seduce at Venice  he followed   hither  and under the pretence of being   her husband  gained the people of the house on   his side  and had infallibly compassed his intent    had it not been for my seasonable interposition    I am too well convinced of the justice I presume   to implore  to doubt if your highness will   oblige him to clear up the affair to the podestat    on which she will be at liberty to prosecute her   journey  and I to throw myself  with the utmost   gratitude and submission  at your feet  who have   the honour to be       Your royal highness s        Most devoted       DU PLESSIS         Padua           Louisa  who was ignorant what her lover had done  and knew no other way    than by writing to Melanthe  to extricate herself from this trouble    sent a letter to her  the contents whereof were as follows          MADAM        On what imagined cause whatever you were   pleased to banish me  I am certain you   have too much goodness to suffer any one    much less a person you have once honoured   with your friendship  to remain in prison for a   crime it is impossible for me to be guilty of   I   am sorry I must accuse a person so dear to   you   but it is  madam  no other than the   unworthy count de Bellfleur  who followed me   hither  came into the inn where I was lodged    into the very chamber  and oh  I tremble   while I relate it  had proceeded yet farther  and   I had been inevitably lost  had not heaven sent   me a deliverer in the unexpected arrival of monsieur   du Plessis  who is also a prisoner as well   as myself  for the timely rescue he gave me    You will wonder  doubtless  by what law either   I should be confined for endeavouring to defend   my chastity  or he  for generously assisting me    but the detested artful count had pretended himself   my husband  and under the sanction of   that name it was  that he met no opposition to   his wicked will from the people of the house    and rendered them regardless of my shrieks and   cries   The magistrates are yet dubious of the   truth  and till it can be proved what I really am    both myself and monsieur du Plessis must continue   where we are   have pity on me  therefore    I conjure you  madam  and write to the podestat    I have already told him I had the honour to   belong to you   a line from you will confirm   it  and once more set at liberty a maid  who   will ever remember all your favours
