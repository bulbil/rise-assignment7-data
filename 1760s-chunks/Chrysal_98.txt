 in the company of a few of his parti    cular favourites  and the best customers of this motley set  having   dismissed the rest to the pursuit of their occupations      The business of the day  and the pleasures of the night  had so   far exhausted his spirits  that nature required a long pause   ac    cordingly  no business coming in to disturb him  for such was his   vigilance in his office  and care for the pubUo  that everything gave   way to that  he made a late morning  not waking till he was called   to attend a sermon and dinner  which were to be that day for the   benefit of a charity  to which he was a constant benefactor   as   indeed his public spirit made him to aU that were already estab    lished  and prompted him to strike out many new   in which  as   the author of them  he hoped to have the management  while   novelty should make it the fashion to support them      But in this he was always disappointed  For though  in the   multitude of his schemes  he sometimes stumbled upon a good one    yet his head was so confused  and his notions so wild and unmethodi    cal  that before he could digest his plans into any regularity  some   one else took up the hint  and ran away with the credit of the design      At church he edified greatly by a comfortable nap during the   sermon  which finished his refreshment  and sent him with a clear   head and keen stomach  to the feast  where every person seemed   to vie in demonstrating liis attachment to the cause of their meeting    by the quantity he ate and drank      I here changed my service once more  being given by his worship   to the subscription  and so came into the possession of a community   in general  which gave me an opportunity of seeing the human heart   in a more compUoated view than perhaps any other scene of its   actions could afford   as there was hardly a profession  degree  or   rank of life  which had not a representative in this meeting  nor a   motive of action  however apparently contrary to its design  or   contradictory to each other  which did not contribute its influence   to the bringing them together      While I lay in the hands of the treasurer of the charity  un    assigned to any particular use  or person  I enjoyed a state of liberty    something like that of living in a commonwealth  having it in my   power to enter into the hearts of all the governors  who were now   my owners  as I liked  and to make any observations  without   restraint  to any particular person  time  or place      CSharity is the most amiable and most exalted of the human virtues    and that which rises to the nearest imitation of the divine  Nor   can anything be stronger proof of the beneficence of the author of   the human nature  than his placing this virtue  which is the per    fection of it  within the reach of every individuaL     For charity is a disposition to think well of  and do well to every   other human being  without partiality  prejudice  or respect to any   other motive  than this universal duty   giving of alms being no   more than one  and that perhaps the very meanest effect of it          96 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     But this extensiveness of the nature of charity is the reason of   ifs being generally misconceived  and most erroneously confined   to this effect by minds unable to comprehend its greater excellence     and  from this mistake  have proceeded many of the extraordinary   instances of this effect of charity  which distinguishes the present   age      This is a most dangerous error   it is too like thinking to bribe   heaven with the wages of hell   and yet  profanely absurd as such   a notion is  daily observation shows the extensive prevalence of it      As charity is such a reflned and exalted virtue  and purely scrip    tural  it must appear strange to you how it should enter into the   head of man  to make so gross  dull  and sensual a passion as eating    the foundation of it   Indeed  so unnatural is the thought to pure   speculation  unacquainted with the perversions of life  that a charity   feast  in the literal meaning of the phrase  must be taken for a   meeting of the poor  to eat the provisions supplied for them by the   rich
