taken out after by a French surgeon  and  after all  recovered  and did his duty very well without it   If death  said my father  reasoning with himself  is nothing but the separation of the soul from the body —and if it is true that people can walk about and do their business without brains —then certes the soul does not inhabit there  Q  E  D   As for that certain  very thin  subtle  and very fragrant juice which Coglionissimo Borri  the great Milaneze physician  affirms  in a letter toBartholine  to have discovered in the cellulae of the occipital parts    of the cerebellum  and which he likewise affirms to be the principal seat of the reasonable soul  for  you must know  in these latter and more enlightened ages  there are two souls in every man living —the one  according to the great Metheglingius  being called the Animus  the other theAnima  —as for this opinion  I say  of Borri —my father could never subscribe to it by any means  the very idea of so noble  so refined  so immaterial  and so exalted a being as the Anima  or even the Animus  taking up her residence  and sitting dabbling  like a tad pole  all day long  both summer and winter  in a puddle —or in a liquid of any kind  how thick or thin soever  he would say  shock d his imagination  he would scarce give the doctrine a hearing   What  therefore  seem d the least liable to objections of any  was  that the chief    sensorium  or head quarters of the soul  and to which place all intelligences were referred  and from whence all her mandates were issued —was in  or near  the cerebellum —or rather some where about the medulla oblongata  wherein it was generally agreed by Dutch anatomists  that all the minute nerves from all the organs of the seven senses concentered  like streets and winding alleys  into a square   So far there was nothing singular in my father s opinion —he had the best of philosophers  of all ages and climates  to go along with him —But here he took a road of his own  setting up another Shandean hypothesis upon these corner stones they had laid for him —and which said hypothesis equally stood its ground  whether the subtilty and fineness of the soul depended upon the temperature and clearness    of the said liquor  or of the finer net work and texture in the cerebellum itself  which opinion he favoured   He maintained  that next to the due care to be taken in the act of propagation of each individual  which required all the thought in the world  as it laid the foundation of this incomprehensible contexture in which wit  memory  fancy  eloquence  and what is usually meant by the name of good natural parts  do consist —that next to this and his Christianname  which were the two original and most efficacious causes of all —that the third cause  or rather what logicians call the Causa sine quâ non  and without which all that was done was of no manner of significance —was the preservation of this delicate and fine spun web  from the havock which was generally made in it by    the violent compression and crush which the head was made to undergo  by the nonsensical method of bringing us into the world by that part foremost   —This requires explanation   My father  who dipp d into all kinds of books  upon looking into Lithopaedus Senonesis de Partu difficili   published by    Adrianus Smelvgot  had found out  That the lax and pliable state of a child s head in parturition  the bones of the cranium having no futures at that time  was such —that by force of the woman s efforts  which  in strong labour pains  was equal  upon an average  to a weight of 470 pounds averdupoise acting perpendicularly upon it —it so happened that  in 49 instances out of 50  the said head was compressed and moulded into the shape of an oblong conical piece of dough  such as a pastry cook generally rolls up in order to make a pye of —Good God  cried my father  what havock and destruction must this make in the infinitely fine and tender texture of the cerebellum —Or if there is such a juice as Borri pretends —is it not enough to make the clearest liquor in the world both feculent and mothery     But how great was his apprehension  when he further understood  that this force  acting upon the very vertex of the head  not only injured the brain itself or cerebrum —but that it necessarily squeez d and propell d the cerebrum towards the cerebellum  which was the immediate seat of the understanding —Angels and Ministers of grace defend us  cried my father —can any soul withstand this shock —No wonder the intellectual web is so rent and tatter d as we see it  and that so many of our best heads are no better than a puzzled skein of silk —all perplexity —all confusion within side   But when my father read on  and was let into the secret  that when a child was turn d topsy turvy  which was easy for an operator
