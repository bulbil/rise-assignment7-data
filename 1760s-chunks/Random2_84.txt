letter from him  which  he said  required an immediate answer  Upon which I opened it  and read  SIR   WHEN any man injures my honour  let the difference of rank between us be ever so great  I am contented to wave the privilege of my quality  and seek reparation from him on equal terms —The insolence of your reply to me yesterday  in the longroom  I might have overlooked  had not your presumptive emulation in a much more interesting affair  and a discovery which I made this morning  concurred in persuading me to chastise your audacity with my sword —If you therefore  have spirit enough to support the character you assume  you will not fail to follow the bearer immediately to a convenient place  where you shall be met by  Quiverwit   Whether I was enervated by the love and favour of Narcissa  or awed by the superior station of my antagonist  I know not  but I never had less inclination to fight than at this time  However  finding there was a necessity for vindicating   251 the reputation of my mistress  as well as for asserting my own honour  I forthwith rose  and dressing in a hurry  put on my sword  bid Strap attend me  and set out with my conductor  cursing my bad fortune all the way  for having been observed in my return from my angel—So I interpreted his lordship discovery —When I came within sight of my rival  his lacquey told me  he had orders to stop  upon which  I commanded Strap to halt also  while I walked forward  resolved  if possible  to come to an explanation with my challenger  before we should come to battle —Nor was an opportunity wanting  for I no sooner approached  than he asked with a stern countenance  what business I had in Mr  Tophall s garden  so early in the morning —   I don t know  my Lord   said I  how to answer a question put to me with such a magisterial haughtiness —If your lordship will please to expostulate calmly  you will have no cause to repent of your condescension—Otherwise  I am not to be intimidated into any confession  —   There s no room for denial  answered he  I saw you come out with my own eyes  —   Did any other person see me    said I  —   I neither know nor care  said he  I want no other evidence than that of my own senses  —  Pleased to hear that the suspicion was confined to him alone  I endeavoured to appease his jealousy  by owning an intrigue with the waiting maid  but he had too much discernment to be so easily imposed upon  and told me there was only one way to convince him of the truth of what I alledged  which was no other than renouncing all claim to Narcissa upon oath  and promising upon honour    252 never to speak to her for the future —Exasperated at this proposal  I unsheathed my sword  saying    Heavens  what title have you  or any man on earth  to impose such terms on me    He did the same  and making towards me with a contracted brow  said I was a villain  and had dishonoured Narcissa —   He s a scandalous villain  I replied  in a transport of fury  who brands me with that imputation  She is a thousand times more chaste than the mother who bore you  and I will assert her honour with my heart s blood  —  So saying  I rushed upon him with more eagerness than address  and endeavouring to get within his point  received a wound in my neck  which redoubled my rage —He excelled me in temper as well as in skill  by which means he parried my thrusts with great calmness  until I had almost exhausted my spirits  and when he perceived me beginning to flag  attacked me fiercely in his turn —Finding himself however better opposed than he expected  he resolved to follow his longe  and close with me  accordingly  his sword entered my waistcoat  on the side of the breast bone  and running up between my shirt and skin  appeared over my left shoulder  I imagined that his weapon had perforated my lungs  and of consequence  that the wound was mortal  therefore determined not to die unrevenged  I seized his shell  which was close to my breast  before he could disintangle his point  and keeping it fast with my left hand  shortned my own sword with my right  intending to run him through the heart  but he received the thrust in the left arm  which penetrated up to the shoulder blade —Disappointed in this expectation  and afraid still that death   253 would frustrate my revenge  I grappled with him  and being much the stronger  threw him upon the ground  where I wrested his sword out of his hand  and so great was my confusion  instead of turning the point upon him  struck out three of his fore teeth with the hilt —In the mean time  our servants seeing us fall  run up to separate and assist us  but before their approach  I was upon my feet  and had discovered
