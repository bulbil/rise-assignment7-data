an instant was crowded with people  attracted less by compassion than curiosity  The relations of the deceased no sooner got wind of his departure than they pounced down upon the premises  and sealed up everything  From the housekeeper s distreess they thought there was no will  but they soon found their mistake  and that there was one without a flaw  When it was opened  and they learned the disposition of the testator s principal property  in favour of Dame Jacintha and the little girl  they pronounced his funeral oration in terms not a little disparaging to his memory  They gave a broad apostrophe at the same time to the godly legatee  and a few blessings to me in my turn  It must be owned I had earned them  The licentiate  heaven reward him for it  to secure my remembrances through life  expressed himself thus in a paragraph of his will    Item  as Gil Blas has already some little smattering of literature  to encourage his studious habits  I give and bequeath to him my library  all my books and my manuscripts  without any drawback or exception   I could not conceive where this said library might be  I had never seen any  I only knew of some papers  with five or six bound books  on two little deal shelves in my master s closet  and that was my legacy  The books too could be of no great use to me  the title of one was  The complete Man Cook  another  A Treatise on Indigestion  with the Methods of Cure  the rest were the four parts of the breviary  half eaten up by the worms  In the article of manuscripts  the most curious consisted of documents relating to a lawsuit in which the prebendary was once engaged for his stall  After having examined my legacy with more minuteness than it deserved  I made over my right and title to these invidious relations  I even renounced my livery  and took back my own suit  claiming my wages as my only reward  I then went to look out for another place  As for Dame Jacintha  besides her residue under the will  she had some snug little articles  which  by the help of her good friend  she had appropriated to her own use during the last illness of the licentiate       CH  III     Gil Blas enters into Doctor Sangrado s service  and becomes a famous practitioner   I DETERMINED to throw myself in the way of Signor Arias de Londona  and to look out for a new berth in his register  but as I was on my way to No Thoroughfare  who should come across me but Doctor Sangrado  whom I had not seen since the day of my master s death  I took the liberty of touching my hat  He kenned me in a twinkling  though I had changed my dress  and with as much warmth as his temperament would allow him  Hey day  said he  the very lad I wanted to see  you have never been out of my thought  I have occasion for a clever fellow about me  and pitched upon you as the very thing  if you can read and write  Sir  replied I  if that is all you require  I am your man  In that case  rejoined he  we need look no further  Come home with me  it will be all comfort  I shall behave to you like a brother  You will have no wages  but everything will be found you  You shall eat and drink according to the true faith  and be taught to cure all diseases  In a word  you shall rather be my young Sangrado than my footman   I closed in with the doctor s proposal  in the hope of becoming an Esculapius under so inspired a master  He carried me home on the spur of the occasion  to instal me in my honourable employment  which honourable employment consisted in writing down the name and residence of the patients who sent for him in his absence  There had indeed been a register for this purpose  kept by an old domestic  but she had not the gift of spelling accurately  and wrote a most perplexing hand  This account I was to keep  It might truly be called a bill of mortality  for my members all went from bad to worse during the short time they continued in this system  I was a sort of book keeper for the other world  to take places in the stage  and to see that the first come were the first served  My pen was always in my hand  for Doctor Sangrado had more practice than any physician of his time in Valladolid  He had got into reputation with the public by a certain professional slang  humoured by a medical face  and some extraordinary cases  more honoured by implicit faith than scrupulous investigation   He was in no want of patients  nor consequently of property  He did not keep the best house in the world  we lived with some little attention to economy  The usual bill of fare consisted of peas  beans  boiled apples or cheese  He considered this food as best suited to the human stomach  that is to say  as most amenable to
