possession of a rational mind  as that the Deity can be pleased   vsdth the breach of His most strict command  and rendered propitious   by an action against which His severest vengeance is denounced     yet such are the errors which the least deviation from the straight   paths of reason lead to  when ceremony is made the essence of re    ligion  and human inventions substituted in the place of immutable    eternal virtue      The devil  whoever is meant by that most comprehensive name    has long been charged with being the author of this and every other   vice and folly  which men are ashamed of owning themselves  his   temptation being a convenient and comfortable excuse  But  if   man would consider a little  he must blush at so unfair and ridiculous   a charge  and give the poor devil his due  who  among all his failings    has never been suspected of being a fool  and nothing else could have   devised such gross enormities  such contradictions to the plainest   rules of common reason      But of this strange institution of human sacrifices we need search   for the original no farther than in the heart of man  who  observing   that to inculcate the duty of gratitude  the first of moral virtues    the Divine Will had directed returns of its blessings to be made  in         226 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     the way of oblation or sacrifice  soon perverted the original purity   of the institution to his own depravity  and measuring the divine   beneficence by his capricious avarice  concluded that the richer   the oblation  or the dearer to the offerer  the greater would the merit   of it be  and thus he arose from a lamb to a hecatomb  from brute   to human blood  His eagerness to obtain the end  for which he   thus strove to bribe the favour of Heaven  prevented his seeing the   absurdity of the means he used      All thintrs being prepared  the victims were brought to the altar    naked and bound  the instruments for slaying  and the fires for   roasting them  for  horror to human thought   they were to have   feasted on their flesh  in readiness  and the butchers  of whom my   master was one  just going to begin their work  when the doors of   the house were burst open  with an outcry that heightened the   terrors of the guilty wretches  and a band of soldiers rushed in and   seized them  as they stood stupefied with the fright  The horror of   the sight gave a respite to their fate  striking the very hearts of the   soldiers  though hardened by all the cruelties of war  with an aston    ishment that deprived them of power to stir for some moments      But this was only a short calm  that  as it were  gave time to the   storm to gather  for  as they stood thus gazing at each other  one   of the children cried out â€”   Oh  father  father  come and untie my   hands   these ugly cords hurt me         The voice no sooner struck the ear of the of cer who commanded   the party  than  starting in a  frenzy  he ran to the child  whom he   had not distinguished before  as he lay naked on the ground  and   snatching him up in his arms â€”   Oh  my child    said he  in an ecstasy      have I found you   have I rescued you in the very moment when   you were going to be sacrificed by these wretches   Oh  my child     my child         These words awoke the fury of the soldiers  which burst upon the   wretched Jews with a violence not to be restrained  The house   was in a moment a scene of horror beyond description  Most of   them fell instant sacrifices to this resistless rage  Happier far in   having so speedily an end put to their sufferings  than the few   survivors  who saved their lives for that moment  by throwing   themselves among the dead  or taking hold of the children whom    even in this hurricane of passion  the soldiers took all care not to   hurt      The little respite which this caution gave  the officers improved to   pacify the soldiers  who would not be persuaded to spare the rest   by any other argument but a positive assurance of having them   put to the most severe and infamous public death      When the storm was a little calmed by these means  and the   living separated from the dead  the pillage of
