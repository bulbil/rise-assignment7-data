Head as Mr  Fool was expressing his Sentiments upon his Sister s Adventures  begging Pardon for interrupting him  thus the elderly Lady held forth  The Pleasures of Life are much like the old Proverb  great Cry and little Wool  I have seen many Scenes of Life  and am sick of all I have seen  Unhappy Women  as your Sister very well knows  see  hear  and know more than most Folks imagine  and were we to declare all we have experienced  Mankind wou d be asham d to look one another in the Face   Poets pester us with Precedents of Eve  Cleopatra  and the Ephesian Matron  We are frail  very frail  but what Man can boast of Infallibility  except the Pope  And I don t think his Opinion is held to be Orthodox  We are accused of ruining Mankind  of making Men mad  but I speak from Experience they are mad before we have any Thing to do with them  mad to be with us  mad while they are with us  and as mad to   221leave us  all their Lives only contrary Fits of madness   I once was mantain d by a Person whom the World call d a great Man  He seem d to be very fond of me  but his Desires  were indelicate  irregular  and sometimes preposterous  He was profuse in his Expences upon me  and raving if I ever appear d what he call d indifferent to his Favours  Yet he had one of the best  and one of the finest Women in the World for his Spouse  and four as fine Children  all which he despis d  for the empty Ostentation of being thought the Possessor of a Woman  whom Hundreds had had before him  You see  Sir  I m as ingenuous as your Sister in my Account of myself  I despis d him in my Heart for the Grossness of his Taste  in wasting Time  Fortune  and Reputation  upon me  who was unworthy to be Scullion to the Lady he abandon d   However  his Money was of Service to me  and Women of the Town  like any other Trades people  are not to quarrel with their best Customers   I  like a Frontier Town in Time of War  often changed my Masters  The next Person who own d me  was a Being  whom I cou d  properly class under no   222Character  he call d himself a Jemmy  had a very fine Estate  was very lavish of it  in buying Nick nacks  altering his Furniture  Harness  Post Charriots  and Taverns  Jaunting with me from Inn to Inn  leaving me no other Society than the Landlady  or the melancholy Amusement of looking thro  the Sashes  at the Carriages  and Travellers that came in and out of the Place where we happened to be  He was always boasting of the many fine Women he had enjoy d  nor wou d he let a Lady of Quality escape him  indeed he took Care where he told his Story  It was only to the Landlord s Family  who  like other Dependants  were obliged to be silent  and seem to believe whatever their Patron was pleased to tell them  For my Part  I believe he was Innocency itself  for in the six Months of our dawdling together  I was a Westal to him  he conversed with me as guiltless as my Brother  But with his all Vanity  and throwing away his Money  he never wou d allow me Six pence in my Pocket  This I cou d not bear  and only staid with him till I cou d fix upon a better Chapman   I was recommended to a Man of great Taste  that was the Character given   223me of him  very rich  but very ugly  As to his Person  Women of our Profession have no Business to mind Outsides  Kept Mistresses have no more to do with real Love  than Bailies have with Compassion  I liv d with him in much Splendor  and great Uneasiness  foolishly fond of me in Public  and in private continually thwarting me   He was indeed  as they said  a Man of Taste  but of a very odd one  for  as he confessed to me  Enjoyment was almost insipid to him  All his Pleasure was  to be known  to be well with some very celebrated Lady of Pleasure  and has several Times declared to me  that he wou d not give Six pence to lay with the most exquisite Beauty  unless she was a noted Prostitute  He was all for publick Opinion  but that Opinion cou d not make me doat upon him   Tis true  he was generous enough  nay  rather pressing me sometimes to take Money  for I am not the most mercenary of my Sex  but I cou d not like him  and as he really said  he proved too  that Enjoyment was very insipid with him  nay  rather fatiguing and disgustful   Let those gentlemen  who are pleased to make what Remarks they think fit on our Sex  declare  that a Woman s   224Person is the best Part of the Pleasure  if her Mind or Inclination
