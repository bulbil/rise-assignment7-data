answered the count  if she hears my voice she may  perhaps  be   frighted enough to commit some desperate action   you shall therefore   speak to her  and make some pretence for obliging her to rise       On this they both went up  and the man knocked softly at first  but on   her not answering immediately  more loud   She  who heard him before    but imagining something of what she had heard of others was now going to   happen to herself  was endeavouring to assume all the courage she could   for supporting her in whatever exigence heaven should reduce her to   at   last she asked who was there  and for what reason she was disturbed  The   innkeeper then said he wanted something out of the room  and she must   needs open the door  This she refused to do  but got out of bed and   began to put on her cloaths  resolving to dye as decently as she could    verily believing they were come to rob and murder her       The man  who spoke all by the count s direction  then told her  that if   she would not open the door  he must be obliged to break it  and   presently beat so violently against it  that the poor terrified Louisa   expected it to burst  so thought it would be better to unbolt it of her   own accord  than  by a vain resistance  provoke worse usage than she   might otherwise receive  but what was her astonishment when she beheld   the count de Bellfleur  On the first moment the words monsieur du   Plessis repeated to her  that  he would have her one way or another     came into her mind  and made her give a great shriek  but then almost at   the same time the thought that he might possibly be sent by Melanthe to   bring her back  somewhat mitigated her fears   Unable was she to speak    however  and the consternation she appeared to be in at his presence    joined with his taking her by the hand and bidding her be under no   apprehensions  confirmed the truth of what he had told the innkeeper    who thinking he had no other business there  and they would be soonest   reconciled when alone  left them  together and went down stairs       When the count saw he was gone   I could not support the thoughts of   seeing you no more  my dear Louisa  said he  I have heard Melanthe s   cruel usage of you  and also that your condition is such  that you have   no friends in England to receive you if you should prosecute your   journey   I come therefore to make you an offer  which  in your present   circumstances  you will find it imprudent  I believe  to reject   I long   have loved you  and if you will be mine  will keep you concealed at a   house where I can confide  till my return to the army  then will take   the fame care of you  and place you somewhere near my own quarters  and    as I shall go to Paris as soon as the next campaign is over  will there   provide for you in as handsome a manner as you can wish   for be   assured  dear lovely girl  that no woman upon earth will ever be capable   of making me forsake you       That she had patience to hear him talk so long in this manner  was   wholly owing to the fear and surprize she had been in  and perhaps had   not yet recovered enough from  to make any reply to what he said  if he   had contented himself only with words  but his actions rouzing a   different passion in her soul  she broke from his arms  into which  he   had snatched her at the conclusion of his speech  and looking on him   with eyes sparkling with disdain and rage   perfidious man  cried she    is this   this the consequence of the vows you made Melanthe  and do you   think  after this knowledge of your baseness  I can harbour any idea of   you  but what is shocking and detestable       I never loved Melanthe  by heaven  resumed he  she made me advance  and   not to have returned  them  would have called even my common civility in   question   but from the first moment I saw your beauties  I was   determined to neglect nothing that might give me the enjoyment of   them   fortune has crowned my wishes  you are in my power  and it would   be madness in you to lose the merit of yielding  and I compel me to be   obliged to my own strength for a pleasure I
