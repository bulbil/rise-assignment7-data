 Thus did this pander  whose past life had been one continued series of faithful service and exemplary conduct  sell himself to the devil to feed Mergelina s illicit flame  One morning he came and talked over the whole business with me  saying at his departure  that he had a scheme in his head  to bring about a private interview between us  At the thought my hopes were all re kindled  but they glimmered tremblingly in the socket at a piece of news I heard two hours afterwards  A journeyman apothecary in the neighbourhood  one of our customers  came in to be shaved  While I was making ready to trim his bushy honours  he said    Master Diego  do you know anything about your friend  the old usher  Marcos de Obregon  Is he not going to leave Doctor Oloroso  I said  No  But he is though  replied he  he will get his dismission this very day  His master and mine were talking about it just now in my hearing  and their conversation was to the following effect     Signor Apuntador  said the physician  I have a favour to beg of you  I am not easy about an old usher of mine  and should like to place my wife under the eye of a trusty  strict  and vigilant duenna  I understand you  interrupted my master  You want Dame Melancia  my wife s directress  and indeed mine for the last six weeks  since I have been a widower  Though she would be very useful to me in housewifery  I give her up to you  from a paramount regard to your honour  You may rely upon her for the security of your brow  she is the phoenix of the duenna tribe    a spring gun and a man  trap set in the purlieus of female chastity  During twelve whole years that she was about my wife  whose youth and beauty  you know  were not without their attractions  I never saw the least semblance of manhood within my doors  No  no  by all the powers  That game was not so easily played  And yet I must let you know that the departed saint  heaven rest her soul  had in the outset a great hankering after the delights of the flesh  but Dame Melancia cast her in a new mould  and regenerated her to virtue and self denial  In short  such a guardian of the weaker sex is a treasure  and you will never have done thanking me for my precious gift  Hereupon the doctor expressed his rapture at the issue of the conference  and they agreed  Signor Apuntador and he  on the duenna s succeeding the old usher on this very day   This news  which I thought probable  and turned out to be true  disturbed the pleasurable ideas  just beginning to flow afresh  and renovate my soul  After dinner  Marcos completed the convulsion  by confirming the young drugpounder s story  My dear Diego  said the good squire  I am heartily glad that Doctor Oloroso has turned me off  it spares me a world of trouble  Besides that it hurt my feelings to be invested with the office of a spy  endless must have been the shifts and subterfuges to bring you and Mergelina together in private  We should have been rarely gravelled  Thanks to heaven  I am set free from all such perplexing cares  to say nothing of their attendant danger  On your part  my dear boy  you ought to be comforted for the loss of a few soft moments  which must have been dogged at the heels by a thousand fears and vexations  I relished Marcos  sermon well enough  because my hopes were at an end  the game was lost  I was not  it must be confessed  among the number of those stubborn lovers who bear up against every impediment  but though I had been so  Dame Melancia would have made me let go my hold  The established character of that duenna would have daunted the adventurous spirit of a knight errant  Yet  in whatever colours this phoenix of the duenna tribe might have been painted  I had reason to know  two or three days after wards  that the physician s lady had unset the man trap and spring gun  and given a stop to this watch dog of lubricity  As I was going out to shave one of our neighbours  a civil old gentlewoman stopped me in the street  and asked if my name was Diego de la Fuenta  I said  Yes  That being the case  replied she  I have a little business with you  Place yourself this evening at Donna Mergelina s door  and when you are there  give a signal  and you shall be let in  Vastly well  said I  what must the signal be  I can take off a cat to the life  suppose I was to mew a certain number of times  The very thing  replied this Iris of intrigue  I will carry back your answer  Your most obedient  Signor Diego  Heaven protect the sweet youth  Ah  you are a pretty one  By St Agnes  I wish I was but sweet fifteen  I would not go to market for other
