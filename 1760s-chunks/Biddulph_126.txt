loved  Prepossessed as I was with jealousy  I now took the alarm  I recollected that Mrs Arnold had told me at lord V——’s  upon my first seeing him there  that she had been very well acquainted with him  and I even thought that I had observed something particular in his countenance when he addressed her  I was now sure that he had come into the neighbourhood merely on her account  The hell that I suffered is not to be described  for though I really fancied that I had conceived almost an aversion to Mrs Arnold  I yet could not bear the thoughts of being dishonoured  An accident happened which served to strengthen my suspicions  he then related the circumstance of his seeing you at the public house on the night of the fire  and of his finding Mr Faulkland putting you into your chariot  He owned at the same time  that he was there with Mrs Gerrarde  whom he had conducted out of the play house  having called for her there in his return from making a visit  as he had promised to sup with her that night  Mrs Gerrarde  when she had him at her house  affected to speak with some surprize of your imprudence  in suffering a young man of Mr Faulkland’s known turn for gallantry  to attend you to such a place  and at that hour  Though  added he  Mrs Arnold’s own account of this had satisfied me at the time  yet Mrs Gerrarde’s insinuations blew up the fire anew in my breast  She pretended to sooth me  but the methods she took rather increased my uneasiness  She told me  she believed my honour as yet had received no injury  and to preserve it effectually  she thought I could not do better than    to forbid my wife to see Mr Faulkland  The designing vile woman  continued your husband  knowing that this prohibition would cut off her visits at V—— hall  no doubt apprehended my wife would not so readily acquiesce under it  and she was sure any resistance on her part would but the more inflame me  But in this she was disappointed  for I no sooner required Mrs Arnold’s promise on the occasion  than she  without the least hesitation  made it  My requiring so extraordinary a proof of her obedience  induced Mrs Arnold to enquire into the cause  and upon my explaining it  she acknowleged that Mr Faulkland had once been her lover  and that the match was broken off by her mother  who had conceived some dislike to him  This was so far from gaining credit with me  that it only served to corroborate what Mrs Gerrarde had told me  I was  however  contented for the present with the promise that my wife had made me  of which I informed Mrs Gerrarde   He then proceeded to tell me of his finding you and Mr Faulkland together one evening at the house of Mrs Gerrarde  I must confess  continued he  this unexpected incident transported me beyond the bounds of patience  I suffered  notwithstanding  Mr Faulkland to go quietly out of the house  more for Mrs Gerrarde’s sake than any other consideration  and permitted her to go home with my wife  who I then thought pretended illness   waiting in the mean time at her house for her return  in order to have this extraordinary and unexpected meeting explained   Mrs Gerrarde  on her return expressed the utmost concern and resentment on the occasion  She told me  that as she had expected me that evening  which was really the case   she had sent to my wife to engage her for the next day  in order to prevent her coming to interrupt us  which was not unlikely  as Mrs Arnold had not been to see her from the time she was laid up by the hurt she received  and she said  she did not care to lay herself so open to her servants  as to have herself denied to the wife  whilst she entertained the husband   I myself  continued he  having the same apprehensions  had asked Mrs Arnold  on my going abroad in the morning  how she purposed to dispose of herself for the day  and she had told me she intended to stay at home  Mrs Gerrarde said  that notwithstanding her message  she was surprized with a visit from Mrs Arnold just as she was sitting down to dinner  that she however put a good face on the matter  and received her very cordially  but in order to get rid of her soon  told her  she was engaged abroad in the afternoon  Mrs Arnold  she    added  however thought proper to stay  and I could not avoid asking her to drink coffee  While we were at it  behold  to my very great surprize  Mr Faulkland sent in his name  and immediately entered the parlour   As I guessed  continued Mrs Gerrarde  that this was a settled assignation  I own I was extremely provoked at it  Mr Faulkland  with whom I formerly had a very slight acquaintance at Bath  so slight indeed as never to be visited by him  now very audaciously made an apology for not having waited on me sooner  but said  that he did not hear of my being in the neighbourhood
