 another purse  which he offered  and was accepted  as a charitable  atonement for his criminal behaviour during the interview which the  friar had procured for the good of his soul  The benefaction was no  sooner made  than the mendicant edged off by little and little  till  he joined the rest of the company  leaving his generous patron at full  liberty to prosecute his purpose   It is not to be doubted that our adventurer made a good use of this    6 22 15  3 45 PM   occasion  he practised a thousand flowers of rhetoric  and actually  exhausted his whole address  in persuading her to have compassion upon  his misery  and indulge him with another private audience  without which  he should run distracted  and be guilty of extravagancies which  in  the humanity of her disposition  she would weep to see  But  instead of  complying with his request  she chid him severely for his presumption  in persecuting her with his vicious addresses  she assured him  that  although she had secured a chamber for herself in this place  because  she had no ambition to be better acquainted with the other lady  he  would be in the wrong to disturb her with another nocturnal visit  for  she was determined to deny him admittance  The lover was comforted by  this hint  which he understood in the true acceptation  and his passion  being inflamed by the obstacles he had met with  his heart beat high  with the prospect of possession  These raptures of expectation produced  an inquietude  which disabled him from bearing that share of the  conversation for which he used to be distinguished  His behaviour  at supper was a vicissitude of startings and reveries  The Capuchin   imputing the disorder to a second repulse from his charge  began to  be invaded with the apprehension of being obliged to refund  and in a  whisper forbade our hero to despair   CHAPTER LVI    The French Coquette entraps the Heart of the Jew  against whom Pallet  enters into a Conspiracy  by which Peregrine is again disappointed  and  the Hebrew s Incontinence exposed   Meanwhile the French siren  balked in her design upon her English  cully  who was so easily disheartened  and hung his ears in manifest  despondence  rather than rather than run the risk of making a voyage  that should be altogether unprofitable  resolved to practise her charms  upon the Dutch merchant  She had already made such innovation upon his  heart  that he cultivated her with peculiar complacency  gazed upon her  with a most libidinous stare  and unbended his aspect into a grin  that was truly Israelitish  The painter saw and was offended at this  correspondence  which he considered as an insult upon his misfortune   as well as an evident preference of his rival  and  conscious of his own  timidity  swallowed an extraordinary glass  that his invention might be  stimulated  and his resolution raised to the contrivance and execution  of some scheme of revenge  The wine failed in the expected effect  and   without inspiring him with the plan  served only to quicken his  desire of vengeance  so that he communicated his purpose to his friend  Peregrine  and begged his assistance  but our young gentleman was too  intent upon his own affair to mind the concerns of any other person  and  he declining to be engaged in the project  Pallet had recourse to  the genius of Pickle s valet de chambre  who readily embarked in the  undertaking  and invented a plan  which was executed accordingly   The evening being pretty far advanced  and the company separated into  their respective apartments  Pickle repaired  in all the impatience of  youth and desire  to the chamber of his charmer  and  finding the door  unbolted  entered in a transport of joy  By the light of the room     6 22 15  3 45 PM   which shone through the window  he was conducted to her bed  which he  approached in the utmost agitation  and perceiving her to all appearance  asleep  essayed to wake her with a gentle kiss  but this method proved  ineffectual  because she was determined to save herself the confusion of  being an accomplice in his guilt  He repeated the application  murmured  a most passionate salutation in her ear  and took such other gentle  methods of signifying his presence  as persuaded him that she was  resolved to sleep  in spite of all his endeavours  Flushed with this  supposition  he locked the door  in order to prevent interruption  and   stealing himself under the clothes  set fortune at defiance  while he  held the fair creature circled in his arms   Nevertheless  near as he seemed to be to the happy accomplishment of his  desire  his hope was again frustrated with a fearful noise  which in a  moment awaked his Amanda in a fright  and for the present engaged all  his attention  His valet de chambre  whom Pallet had consulted as a  confederate in his revenge against the lady of pleasure and her gallant
