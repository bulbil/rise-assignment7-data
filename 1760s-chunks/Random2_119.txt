—She was piqued at Narcissa s victory  tossed her head a thousand different ways  flirted her fan  looked   359 at us with disdain  then whispered to her husband  and broke out into an affected giggle  but all her arts proved ineffectual  either to discompose Mrs  Random  or to conceal her own mortification  which at length forced her away long before the play was done —The news of our marriage being spread  with many circumstances to our disadvantage  by the industry of this malignant creature  a certain set of persons  fond of scandal  began to enquire into the particulars of my fortune  which they no sooner understood to be independant  than the tables were turned  and our acquaintance was courted as much as it had been despised before  But Narcissa had too much dignity of pride  to encourage this change of conduct  especially in her relations  whom she could never be prevailed upon to see  after the malicious reports they had raised to her prejudice     360  CHAP  LXIX    My father intends to revisit the place of his nativity—we propose to accompany him—my uncle renews his will in my favour  determining to go to sea again—we set out for Scotland—arrive at Edinburgh—purchase our paternal estate—proceed to to it—halt at the town where I was educated—take up my bond to Crab—the behaviour of Potion and his wife  and one of my female cousins—our reception at the estate—Strap marries Miss Williams  and is settled by my father to his own satisfaction—I am more and more happy   MY father intending to revisit his native country  and pay the tribute of a few tears at my mother s grave  Narcissa and I resolved to accompany him in the execution of this pious office  and accordingly prepared for the journey  in which  however  my uncle would not engage  being resolved to try his fortune once more at sea  In the mean time  he renewed his will in favour of my wife and me  and deposited it in the hands of his brother in law  While I  that I might not be wanting to my own interest  summoned the Squire to produce his father s will   361 at Doctor s Commons  and employed a proctor to manage the affair in my absence   Every thing being thus settled  we took leave of all our friends in London  and set out for Scotland  Don Rodriguez  Narcissa  Miss Williams  and I in the coach  and Strap with two men in livery on horse back  As we made easy stages  my charmer held it out very well  till we arrived at Edinburgh  where we proposed to rest ourselves some weeks  People of our figure could not fail of attracting the notice of such a small place  where  as soon as our family was known  we were loaded with caresses  and Narcissa was so much pleased with the civilities she received  that she protested she would never desire to live in any other part of the world   Here Don Rodriguez having intelligence that his nephew the fox hunter had spent his estate  which was to be exposed to sale by publick auction  he determined to make a purchase of the spot where he was born  and actually bought the whole of his father s lands   In a few days after this bargain was made  we left Edinburgh  in order to go and take possession  and by the way  halted one night in that town where I was educated —Upon inquiry  I found that Mr  Crab was dead  whereupon I sent for his executor  paid the sum I owed  with interest  and took up my bond  Mr  Potion and his wife hearing of our arrival  had the assurance to come to the inn where we lodged  and send up their names  with a desire of being permitted to pay their respects to my father and me  But their fordid behaviour towards me  when I was an orphan  had made too deep an impression on   362 my mind  to be effaced by this mean mercenary piece of condescension  I therefore rejected their message with disdain  and bid Strap tell them  that my father and I desired to have no communication with such low minded wretches as they were   They had not been gone half an hour  when a woman without any ceremony  opened the door of the room where we sat  and making towards my father  accosted him with     Uncle  your servant—I am glad to see you  —  This was no other than one of my female cousins  mentioned in the first part of my memoirs  to whom Don Rodriguez replied    Pray  who are you  madam  —   O   cried she  my cousin Rory there  knows me very well—Don t you remember me  Rory  —   Yes  madam   said I  for my own part  I shall never forget you —Sir  this is one of the young ladies  who  as I have formerly told you  treated me so humanely in my childhood    When I pronounced these words  my father s resentment glowed in his visage  and he ordered her to be gone  with such a commanding aspect  that she retired
