    is the gentleman  who  of all others  seeks my everlasting dishonour        II  I will directly make you a present of 500 guineas  for your own   use  which you may dispose of to any purpose you please  and will give   it absolutely into the hands of any person you shall appoint to receive   it  and expect no favour in return  till you are satisfied in the   possession of it           II   As to your second proposal  let the consequence be what it       will  I reject it with all my soul   Money  sir  is not my chief       good  May God Almighty desert me  whenever it is  and whenever        for the sake of that  I can give up my title to that blessed hope       which will stand me in stead  at a time when millions of gold will       not purchase one happy moment of reflection on a past misspent life        III  I will likewise directly make over to you a purchase I lately made   in Kent  which brings in 250l  per annum  clear of all deductions  This   shall be made over to you in full property for your life  and for the   lives of any children to perpetuity  that you may happen to have  And   your father shall be immediately put into possession of it in trust   for these purposes  and the management of it will yield a comfortable   subsistence to him  and your mother  for life  and I will make up any   deficiencies  if such should happen  to that clear sum  and allow him   50l  per annum  besides  for his life  and that of your mother  for his   care and management of this your estate           III   Your third proposal  sir  I reject for the same reason        and am sorry you could think my poor honest parents would enter       into their part of it  and be concerned for the management of       an estate  which would be owing to the prostitution of their       poor daughter   Forgive  sir  my warmth on this occasion  but       you know not the poor man  and the poor woman  my ever dear       father and mother  if you think  that they would not much rather       choose to starve in a ditch  or rot in a noisome dungeon  than       accept of the fortune of a monarch  upon such wicked terms        I dare not say all that my full mind suggests to me on this       grievous occasion  But  indeed  sir  you know them not  nor       shall the terrors of death  in its most frightful form  I hope        through God s assisting grace  ever make me act unworthy of       such poor honest parents        IV  I will  moreover  extend my favour to any other of your relations    that you may think worthy of it  or that are valued by you           IV   Your fourth proposal  I take upon me  sir  to answer as the       third   If I have any friends that want the favour of the great        may they ever want it  if they are capable of desiring it on       unworthy terms        V  I will  besides  order patterns to be sent you for choosing four   complete suits of rich clothes  that you may appear with reputation  as   if you were my wife  And will give you the two diamond rings  and two   pair of ear rings  and diamond necklace  that were bought by my mother    to present to Miss Tomlins  if the match that was proposed between her   and me had been brought to effect  and I will confer upon you still   other gratuities  as I shall find myself obliged  by your good behaviour   and affection           V   Fine clothes  sir  become not me  nor have I any ambition       to wear them   I have greater pride in my poverty and meanness        than I should have in dress and finery   Believe me  sir  I think       such things less become
