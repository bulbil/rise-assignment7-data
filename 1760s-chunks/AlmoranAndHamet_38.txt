her person  could not bear the alienation of her mind  cried   our  with looks of distraction and a voice scarcely human   Not think of   HAMET   ALMEIDA  whose astonishment was every moment increasing    replied  with a tender and interesting enquiry   Is ALMORAN then   offended  that ALMEIDA mould think of HAMET no more   HAMET  being thus   addressed by the name of his brother  again recollected his situation    and now first conceived the idea  that the alteration of ALMEIDA S   sentiments with respect to himself  might be the effect of some violence   offered her by ALMORAN in his likeness  he  therefore  recurred to his   first purpose  and determined  by a direct enquiry  to discover whether   she had seen him under that appearance  This enquiry he urged with the   utmost solemnity and ardour  in terms suitable to his present appearance   and situation   Tell me   said he   have these doors been open to HAMET    Has he obtained possession of that treasure  which  by the voice of   Heaven  has been allotted to me        To this double question  ALMEIDA answered by a single negative  and her   answer  therefore  was both false and true  it was true that her person   was still inviolate  and it was true also that HAMET had not been   admitted to her  yet her denial of it was false  for she believed the   contrary  ALMORAN only had been admitted  but she had received him as   his brother  HAMET  however  was satisfied with the answer  and did not   discover its fallacy  He looked up to Heaven  with an expression of   gratitude and joy  and then turning to ALMEIDA   Swear then   said he     that thou hast granted to HAMET  no pledge of thy love which should be   reserved for me   ALMEIDA  who now thought nothing more than the   asseveration necessary to quiet his mind  immediately complied   I   swear   said she   that to HAMET I have given nothing  which thou   wouldst wish me to with hold  the power that has devoted my person to   thee  has disunited my heart from HAMET  whom I renounce in thy presence   for ever        HAMET  whose fortitude and recollection were again overborne  was thrown   into an agitation of mind  which discovered itself by looks and gestures   very different from those which ALMEIDA had expected  and overwhelmed   her with new confusion and disappointment  that he  who had so lately   solicited her love with all the vehemence of a desire impatient to be   gratified  should now receive a declaration that she was ready to   comply with marks of distress and anger  was a mystery which she could   not solve  In the mean time  the struggle in his breast became every   moment more violent   Where then   said he   is the constancy which you   vowed to HAMET  and for what instance of his love is he now forsaken        ALMEIDA was now more embarrassed than before  she felt all the force of   the reproof  supposing it to have been given by ALMORAN  and she could   be justified only by relating the particular  which at the expence of   her sincerity she had determined to conceal  ALMORAN was now exalted in   her opinion  while his form was animated by the spirit of HAMET  as much   as HAMET had been degraded  while his form was animated by the spirit   of ALMORAN  In his resentment of her perfidy to his rival  though it   favoured his fondest and most ardent wishes  there was an abhorrence of   vice  and a generosity of mind  which she supposed to have been   incompatible with his character  To his reproach  she could reply only   by complaint  and could no otherwise evade his question  than by   observing the inconsistency of his own behaviour   Your words   said   she   are daggers to my heart  You condemn me for a compliance with your   own wishes  and for obedience to that voice  which you supposed to have   revealed the will of Heaven  Has the caprice of desire already wandered   to a new object  and do you now seek a pretence to refuse  when it is   freely offered  what so lately you would have taken by force        HAMET  who was now fired with resentment against ALMEIDA  whom yet he   could not behold without desire  and who  at the same moment  was   impatient to revenge his wrongs upon ALMORAN  was suddenly prompted to   satisfy all his passions  by taking advantage of the wiles of ALMORAN    and the perfidy of ALMEIDA
