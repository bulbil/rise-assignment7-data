 His intentions were to render himself absolute by their assistance  and  it is but too probable  he might have become so  had he lived to put his designs in execution  but he died at a time he was beginning to throw off parliamentary restrictions  and left the people a share of authority which had been given them for very different purposes than the promotion of liberty  The most healing medicines are often extracted from poisons  in short  whatever Edward s character was  as a man  as a King  he was of infinite service to his country   I am   c   LETTER XVII   Dear Charles   IT was long an opinion of the English  and grounded on observations made from the days of King Arthur  that  between two valiant and able Princes in the nation  there always intervened a King of less sense and courage    moins suffisans de sens et de prouesse   that there was something in the remark you have hitherto seen in several successions     No Monarch could come to a crown with more advantageous omens than Edward II  an army prepared for victory  a people united  and an undisputed succession  But he soon gave them reasons to fear his future conduct  by the commencement of his reign  Regardless of his father s dying admonitions  he discontinued the war with Scotland    115 and recalled Gavestone  his favourite  from exile   Gavestone was a foreigner by birth  adorned with every accomplishment of person and mind that could create affection  but destitute of those qualities of heart and understanding that serve to procure esteem  He was beautiful  witty  brave  but  at the same time  vicious  effeminate  and debauched  he had assisted in all Edward s youthful extravagancies and pleasures  had been  to use a Latin expression  his arbiter elegantiarum  and thus had secured this young voluptuous Monarch s affections   A prudent King may have private friends  but should never retain a public favourite  royal favour should shine with indiscriminate lustre  and the Monarch should ever guard against raising those he most loves to the highest preferments  In being thus biassed by his affections  he will probably be induced to reward talents unequal to the burthen of affairs  or impatient of the fatigues of application  Such was the case of Edward  with regard to his new favourite  he loaded him with favours  at a time when he was giving up his title to the sovereignty of Scotland  which had been so hardly earned by his predecessor   The barons  at this time  were not so entirely humbled  but that they resented a conduct so injurious to the interests of the kingdom as well as their own  Gavestone s pride  his being a foreigner  his insolence  soon raised a strong party against him  an army was formed to oppose his administration  Gavestone was taken and beheaded  without even the formality of a trial  Thus you perceive a spirit of cruelty beginning to enter the nation  the death of Gavestone was  probably    116 supported by the precedents found in the former reign  The successors of Edward the First  copied after him in his faults alone  the vices of conquering Monarchs and great Kings are ever most dangerous  because they most generally produce imitation   From this time the scaffolds were drenched with English blood  each party  as it happened to prove victorious  brought their prisoners  as traitors  to the block or the gibbet  never was so much blood spilt in a juridical manner in England  as in this hideous reign  The Scotch  during these storms  endeavoured to fortify their government  they conquered the English in more than one battle  Robert Bruce  being made King  became powerful from the divisions of the English  who pretended to be his masters   Edward  in the mean time  seemed only intent on prosecuting his pleasures  or becoming formidable to his own subjects  The mutual hatred between him and the barons seemed daily to increase  or  in other words  as he still became more despicable in the eyes of the people  the barons  lately depressed  grew into power  His supineness gave them an opportunity of executing all their designs  so that at last he suffered himself to be taken a prisoner  but he was soon after released  upon a promise of future amendment  A certain number of the barons were admitted into his council  and he gave his word to perform nothing without their consent and approbation  but he was only born for misfortunes  This Monarch  of an easy nature  and who  probably  if born in a private station  would have been considered as a worthy man  could not live without a favourite  Into the place which Gavestone held in his affections    117 Hugh Spencer  a youth of great address and many accomplishments  succeeded  This young gentleman  no way intimidated by the misfortunes of Gavestone  in similar circumstances  pursued his conduct in every particular  he even went beyond him in pride  avarice  and prodigality  An universal discontent soon became visible  all the vices of the King were imputed to young Spencer alone  and his own were enough to sink him
