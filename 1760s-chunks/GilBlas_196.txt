but to wait for us under these willows  we shall not be long before we are with you again  Signor Don Raphael  exclaimed I with a horse  laugh  tell us rather to wait for you under a more substantial tree  the gallows  If you once leave us  we are in a month s mind that we shall not see you again till the day after the fair  This suspicion of our honour goes against the grain  replied Signor Ambrose  but we deserve that our characters should suffer in your esteem  It is but reason that you should distrust our purity  after the affair at Valladolid  and should fancy that we shall make it no more a matter of conscience to play at the devil take the hindmost with you  than with the party that we left in the lurch in that town  Yet you deceive yourselves egregiously  The gang upon whom we turned the tables were people of very bad character  and their company began to be disreputable to us  Thus far justice must be done to the members of our profession  that there is no bond in all civilized life less liable to be broken by personal and private interest  but when there are no feelings in common  our good understanding will be the worse for wear  as it happens among other descriptions of men  Wherefore  Signor Gil Blas  I entreat you  and Signor Don Alphonso as well as you  to be somewhat more liberal in your construction of us  and to set your hearts at respecting Don Raphael s and my whim about going to Segorba   It is the easiest thing in the world  observed Lucinda s hopeful brat  to quash all subject of uneasiness on that score  they have only to remain treasurers of the exchequer  and they will have a sufficient pledge in their hands for our re turn  You see  Signor Gil Blas  that we are all fair and above board  You shall both hold security for our re appearance  and you may rest assured that for Ambrose and myself  we shall set off without the slightest misgiving of your taking to your heels with so valuable a deposit  After so substantial a proof of our good faith  will you not place implicit confidence in us  Yes  gentle men  said I  and you may do at once whatever seems good in your own eyes  They took their departure immediately  carrying the bottle and the wallet along with them  and left me under the willows with Don Alphonso  who said to me after they were out of sight  Now is the time  Signor Gil Blas  now is the time to open my heart to you  I am angry with myself for having been so easily prevailed on to herd thus far with these two knaves  You have no idea how many times I have quarrelled with myself on that score  Yesterday evening  while I was watching the horses  a thousand mortifying reflections rushed upon my mind  I thought it did not become a young man of honourable principles to live among such scurvy fellows as Don Raphael and Lamela  that if by ill luck some day or other  and many a more unlikely thing has happened  the success of our swindling tricks should throw us into the hands of justice  I might sustain the shame of being tried with them as a reputed thief  and under going the disgraceful sentence of the law  These frightful thoughts present themselves incessantly to my imagination  and I will own to you that I have determined  as the only means of escape from the contamination of their bad actions  to part from them for ever  I can scarcely suppose that you will disapprove of my design  No  I promise you  answered I  though you have seen me perform the part of the alguazil in Samuel Simon s comedy  do not fancy that such pieces as those are got up to my taste  I take heaven to witness that while acting in so witty a scene  I said to myself  Faith and troth  master Gil Blas  if justice should come and lay hold of you by the wezand at this moment  you would well deserve the penitential wages of your iniquity  I feel therefore no more disposed than yourself  Don Alphonso  to tarry longer in such bad company  and if you think well of it  I will bear you company  When these gentlemen come back  we will demand a balancing of the accounts  and to morrow morning  or even to night before to morrow  we will make our bow to them   The lovely Seraphina s lover approved my proposal  Let us get to Valencia  said he  and we will embark for Italy  where we shall be able to enter into the service of the Venetian republic  Will it not be far better to take up the profession of arms  than to lead such a dastardly and disreputable life as we are now engaged in  We shall even be in a condition to make a very handsome figure with the money that will be coming to us  Not that I appropriate to myself without remorse a fund so unfairly established  but besides that necessity obliges me to it  if ever I acquire any property in my campaigns  I make a vow to indemnify Samuel Simon  I gave
