butler    that I know much good of you  The night that gentleman s daughter was deluded to our house  you were one of them    —   So then    cried Sir William    I find you have brought a very fine witness to prove your innocence  thou stain to humanity  to associate with such wretches     But continuing his examination    You tell me  Mr  Butler  that this was the person who brought him this old gentleman s daughter    —   No  please your honour    replied the butler    he did not bring her  for the  Squire himself undertook that business  but he brought the priest that pretended to marry them    —   It is but too true    cried Jenkinson    I cannot deny it  that was the employment assigned me  and I confess it to my confusion     Good heavens    exclaimed the Baronet    how every new discovery of his villainy  Page  192  alarms me  All his guilt is now too plain  and I find his present prosecution was dictated by tyranny  cowardice and revenge  at my request  Mr  Gaoler  set this young officer  now your prisoner  free  and trust to me for the consequences  I ll make it my business to set the affair in a proper light to my friend the magistrate who has committed him  But where is the unfortunate young lady herself  let her appear to confront this wretch  I long to know by what arts he has seduced her honour  Entreat her to come in  Where is she     Ah  Sir    said I    that question stings me to the heart  I was once indeed happy in a daughter  but her miseries—   Another interruption here prevented me  for who should make her appearance but Miss Arabella Wilmot  who was next day to have been married to Mr  Thornhill  Nothing could equal her surprize at seeing  Page  193  Sir William and his nephew here before her  for her arrival was quite accidental  It happened that she and the old gentleman her father were passing through the town  on their way to her aunt s  who had insisted that her nuptials with Mr  Thornhill should be consummated at her house  but stopping for refreshment  they put up at an inn at the other end of the town  It was there from the window that the young lady happened to observe one of my little boys playing in the street  and instantly sending a footman to bring the child to her  she learnt from him some account of our misfortunes  but was still kept ignorant of young Mr  Thornhill s being the cause  Though her father made several remonstrances on the impropriety of going to a prison to visit us  yet they were ineffectual  she desired the child to conduct her  which he did  and it was thus she surprised us at a juncture so unexpected   Page  194  Nor can I go on  without a reflection on those accidental meetings  which  though they happen every day  seldom excite our surprize but upon some extraordinary occasion  To what a fortuitous concurrence do we not owe every pleasure and convenience of our lives  How many seeming accidents must unite before we can be cloathed or fed  The peasant must be disposed to labour  the shower must fall  the wind fill the merchant s sail  or numbers must want the usual supply     We all continued silent for some moments  while my charming pupil  which was the name I generally gave this young lady  united in her looks compassion and astonishment  which gave new finishings to her beauty      Indeed  my dear Mr  Thornhill    cried she to the  Squire  who she supposed was come here to succour and not to oppress us    I take it a little unkindly that you should come here without  Page  195  me  or never inform me of the situation of a family so dear to us both  you know I should take as much pleasure in contributing to the relief of my reverend old master here  whom I shall ever esteem  as you can  But I find that  like your uncle  you take a pleasure in doing good in secret     He find pleasure in doing good    cried Sir William  interrupting her    No  my dear  his pleasures are as base as he is  You see in him  madam  as complete a villain as ever disgraced humanity  A wretch  who after having deluded this poor man s daughter  after plotting against the innocence of her sister  has thrown the father into prison  and the eldest son into fetters  because he had courage to face his betrayer  And give me leave  madam  now to congratulate you upon an escape from the embraces of such a monster    Page  196     O goodness    cried the lovely girl    how have I been deceived  Mr  Thornhill
