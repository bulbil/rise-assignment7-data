she was for following pleasure every   where  and having seen all that was worth observing in Germany  was   impatient to be gone where new company and new delights excited her   curiosity       Having therefore obtained proper passports  they set out in company with   several others who were taking the same rout  and by easy journeys thro    Tyrol  at length arrived at that republic  so famous over all Europe for   its situation  antiquity  and the excellence of its constitution       Here seemed to be at this time an assemblage of all that was to be found   of grand and polite in the whole christian world  but none appeared with   that splendor and magnificence as did Lewis de Bourbon  prince of Conti    he had in his train above fifty noblemen and gentlemen of the best   families in France  who had commissions under him in the army  and   seemed proud to be of his retinue  less for his being of the blood   royal  than for the many great and amiable qualities which adorned his   person  This great hero had been a candidate with Augustus  elector of   Saxony  for the crown of Poland  but the ill genius of that kingdom   would not suffer it to be governed by a prince whose virtues would   doubtless have rendered it as flourishing and happy as it has since that   unfortunate rejection been impoverished and miserable  Bigotted to a   family whose designs are plainly to render the crown hereditary  they   not only set aside that great prince  under the vain and common place   pretence  that on electing him they might be too much under the   influence of France  but also afterward  as resolved to push all good   fortune from them with both hands  refused Stanislaus  a native of   Poland  a strict observer of its laws  and a man to whose courage    virtue  and every eminent qualification even envy itself could make no   objection  and thereby rendered their country the seat of war and   theatre of the most terrible devastations of all kinds  But of this   infatuation of the Poles I shall have occasion hereafter to speak more   at large  and should not now have made any mention of it  had not the   presence of that hero  whom they first rejected  rendered it the general   subject of discourse at Venice  Numberless were the instances he gave of   a magnanimity and greatness of mind worthy of a more exalted throne than   that of Poland  but I shall only mention one  which  like the thumb of   Hercules  may serve to give a picture of him in miniature       Having the good fortune one night to win a very great sum at a public   gaming  just as he sweep d the stakes  a noble Venetian  who by some   casualties in life was reduced in his circumstances  could not help   crying out  heavens  how happy would such a chance have made me  these   words  which the extreme difficulties he was under forced from him    without being sensible himself of what he said  were over heard by the   prince  who turning hastily about  instead of putting the money into his   own pocket  presented it to him  saying  I am doubly indebted to chance    sir  which has made me master of this  since it may be of service to   you  I beseech you therefore to accept it with the respects of a prince    whose greatest pleasure in life is to oblige a worthy person       It would take up too much time to expatiate on the grateful   acknowledgments made by the Venetian  or the admiration which the report   of this action being immediately spread  occasioned  but  added to   others of a little less conspicuous nature  it greatly served to   convince those who before were ignorant of it  how blind the Polanders   had been to their own interest       Among the concourse of nobility and gentry  whom merely the love of   pleasure had drawn hither  and for that end were continually forming   parties  Melanthe never failed of making one either in one company or   other  Louisa  whom that lady still treated with her former kindness  or   rather with an increase of it  was also seldom absent  and when she was   so  the fault was wholly her own inclination  but in truth  that hurry   of incessant diversion  which at first had seemed so ravishing to her   young and unexperienced mind  began  by a more perfect acquaintance with   it  to grow tiresome to her  and she rather chose sometimes to retire   with a favourite book into her closet  than to go to the most elegant   entertainment       It is certain  indeed  that her disposition
