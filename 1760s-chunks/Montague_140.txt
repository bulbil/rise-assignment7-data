cecisbeo  mine is extremely at your service in return        But I am piqued  my dear   Sentiments so noble  so peculiar to your Rivers        I am apt to believe there are men in the world that nobleness of mind is not so very peculiar and that some people s sentiments may be as noble as other people s       In short  I am inclined to fancy Fitzgerald would have acted just the same part in the same situation        But it is your great fault  my dear Emily  to suppose your love a phoenix  whereas he is only an agreable  worthy  handsome fellow  comme un autre        I suppose you will be very angry  but who cares  I will be angry too        Surely  my Fitzgerald I allow Rivers all his merit  but comparisons  my dear       Both our fellows  to be sure  are charming creatures  and I would not change them for a couple of Adonis s  yet I don t insist upon it  that there is nothing agreable in the world but them        You should remember  my dear  that beauty is in the lover s eye  and that  however highly you may think of Rivers  every woman breathing has the same idea of the dear man       O heaven  I must tell you  because it will flatter your vanity about your charmer       I have had a letter from an old lover of mine at Quebec  who tells me  Madame Des Roches has just refused one of the best matches in the country  and vows she will live and die a batchelor         Tis a mighty foolish resolution  and yet I cannot help liking her the better for making it        My dear papa talks of taking a house near you  and of having a garden to rival yours  we shall spend a good deal of time with him  and I shall make love to Rivers  which you know will be vastly pretty       One must do something to give a little variety to life  and nothing is so amusing  or keeps the mind so pleasingly awake  especially in the country  as the flattery of an agreable fellow        I am not  however  quite sure I shall not look abroad for a flirt  for one s friend s husband is almost as insipid as one s own        Our romantic adventures being at an end  my dear  and we being all degenerated into sober people  who marry and settle  we seem in great danger of sinking into vegetation  on which subject I desire Rivers s opinion  being  I know  a most exquisite enquirer into the laws of nature        Love is a pretty invention  but  I am told  is apt to mellow into friendship  a degree of perfection at which I by no means desire Fitzgerald s attachment for me to arrive on this side seventy       What must we do  my dear  to vary our days       Cards  you will own  are an agreable relief  and the least subject to pall of any pleasures under the sun  and really  philosophically speaking  what is life but an intermitted pool at quadrille       I am interrupted by a divine colonel in the guards       Adieu  Your faithful  A  FITZGERALD     LETTER CCXXVIII   228   To Mrs  FITZGERALD   Bellfield  Tuesday   I ACCEPT your challenge  Bell  and am greatly mistaken if you find me so very insipid as you are pleased to suppose       Have no fear of falling into vegetation  not one amongst us has the least vegetative quality       I have a thousand ideas of little amusements  to keep the mind awake       None of our party are of that sleepy order of beings  who want perpetual events to make them feel their existence  this is the defect of the cold and inanimate  who have not spirit and vivacity enough to taste the natural pleasures of life       Our adventures of one kind are at an end  but we shall see others  as entertaining  springing up every moment       I dare say  our whole lives will be Pindaric  my only plan of life is to have none at all  which  I think  my little Bell will approve       Please to observe  my sweet Bell  to make life pleasant  we must not only have great pleasures but little ones  like the smaller auxiliary parts of a building  we must have our trifling amusements  as well as our sublime transports        My first second pleasure  if you will allow the expression  is gardening  and for this reason  that it is my divine Emily s  I must teach you to love rural pleasures       Colonel Willmott has made me just as rich as I wish to be       You must know  my fair friend  that whilst I thought a fortune and Emily incompatible  I had infinite contempt for the former  and fancied that it would rather take from  than
