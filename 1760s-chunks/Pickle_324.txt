 in your belly  with a barrel of gunpowder   exclaimed the enraged cynic    since I must be excruciated  read that plaguy paper   Sblood  why  didn t nature clap a pair of long ears and a tail upon me  that I might  be a real ass  and champ thistles on some common  independent of my  fellow creatures  Would I were a worm  that I might creep into the  earth  and thatch my habitation with a single straw  or rather a wasp  or a viper  that I might make the rascally world feel my resentment  But  why do I talk of rascality  folly  folly  is the scourge of life  Give  me a scoundrel  so he be a sensible one  and I will put him in my heart  of hearts  but a fool is more mischievous than famine  pestilence  and  war  The idiotical hag that writes  or causes to be writ  this same  letter  has ruined her family  and broke her husband s heart  by  ignorance and mismanagement  and she imputes her calamity to Providence  with a vengeance  and so I am defrauded of three hundred pounds  the  greatest part of which I owe to tradesmen  whom I have promised to pay  this very quarter  Pox upon her  I would she were a horned beast  that  the distemper might lay hold on her  The beldame has the impudence too   after she has brought me into this dilemma  to solicit my assistance  to stock the farm anew  Before God  I have a good mind to send her a  halter  and perhaps I might purchase another for myself  but that I  would not furnish food for laughter to knaves and coxcombs    Peregrine having perused the billet  and listened to this ejaculation   replied with great composure  that he was ashamed to see a man of  his years and pretensions to philosophy so ruffled by a trifle   What  signify all the boasted hardships you have overcome   said he   and the  shrewd observations you pretend to have made on human nature  Where is  that stoical indifference you affirm you have attained  if such a paltry  disappointment can disturb you in this manner  What is the loss of  three hundred pounds  compared with the misfortunes which I myself have  undergone within these two years  Yet you will take upon you to act the  censor  and inveigh against the impatience and impetuosity of youth  as  if you yourself had gained an absolute conquest over all the passions  of the heart  You were so kind as to insult me another day in my  affliction  by reproaching me with indiscretion and misconduct  suppose  I were now to retort the imputation  and ask how a man of your profound  sagacity could leave your fortune at the discretion of ignorant  peasants  How could you be so blind as not to foresee the necessity of  repairs  together with the danger of bankruptcy  murrain  or thin crop   Why did you not convert your land into ready money  and  as you have no    6 22 15  3 45 PM   connections in life  purchase an annuity  on which you might have lived  at your ease  without any fear of the consequence  Can t you  from the  whole budget of your philosophy  cull one apophthegm to console you for  this trivial mischance     Rot your rapidity   said the cynic  half choked with gall   if the  cancer or the pox were in your throat  I should not be thus tormented  with your tongue  and yet a magpie shall speak infinitely more to the  purpose  Don t you know  Mr  Wiseacre  that my case does not fall within  the province of philosophy  Had I been curtailed of all my members   racked by the gout and gravel  deprived of liberty  robbed of an only  child  or visited with the death of a dear friend like you  philosophy  might have contributed to my consolation  but will philosophy pay my  debts  or free me from the burden of obligation to a set of fellows whom  I despise   speak pronounce demonstrate  or may Heaven close your mouth  for ever     These are the comfortable fruits of your misanthropy   answered the  youth   your laudable scheme of detaching yourself from the bonds of  society  and of moving in a superior sphere of your own  Had you not  been so peculiarly sage  and intent upon laughing at mankind  you could  never have been disconcerted by such a pitiful inconvenience  any friend  would have accommodated you with the sum in question  But now the world  may retort the laugh  for you stand upon such an agreeable footing with  your acquaintance  that nothing could please them better than an account  of your having given disappointment the slip  by the help of a noose  properly applied  This I mention by way of hint  upon which I would have  you chew the cud of reflection  and  should it
