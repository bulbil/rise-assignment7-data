preferred to be one of his falconers  in which post he died  As for the priest  his instructor  he was made a prisoner for life   Things being thus adjusted  we may turn to France  which had long been the grave of the English  who yet coveted nothing so much as to continue the war there  Henry had all along perceived the futility of conquests upon the continent  conquests that could produce no other advantages than military glory  but  while he internally despised such pernicious triumphs  he was obliged  in order to gain popularity  to countenance them  He therefore often pretended  that he was going to ravish his kingdom once more from the usurper  and lay all France in blood  but  in fact  he had nothing farther from his heart  As far as negotiations and threats went  he did all that lay in his power to keep the jarring states of that kingdom nearly balanced  and consequently feeble  but  as for succours of men and money  he too well knew the value of both to exhaust them  in the manner of his predecessors  upon such vain projects     214 The parliament  however  was taught to believe  that he intended something considerable against France  and they  ever chearful when France was to be opposed  furnished him with the necessary supplies  But money was  at that time  more easily granted than levied in England  A new insurrection arose when the supplies came to be collected  and the Earl of Northumberland was killed by the mob of Yorkshire  while he attempted to enforce obedience to the laws  The mutineers did not stop here  by the advice of one John a Chamber  an incendiary  they set Sir John Egremont at their head  and marched towards London to give the King battle  the consequence of this rash step was the defeat of the rebels  and the death of John a Chamber  their ring leader  It was necessary to treat this man with rigour  to induce a more ready compliance to the future grants of parliament  and prevent all insurrections on the same occasion  for now people seemed continually more willing to revolt than to pay their taxes   One would not have imagined  by the success of Simnel s imposture  that it could have produced imitations  but the old Duchess of Burgundy  sister to Edward IV  finding the former fraud had deceived so many  was resolved to project a new scheme  with more art and greater plausibility  She first spread a report  that the young Duke of York  said to have been murdered in the Tower  was still alive  and soon a youth made his appearance that took upon him the title of the Duke of York  The person pitched upon to play this part was called Peter Warbeck  the son of a Flemish Jew  a youth of a beautiful person  good understanding  and possessing something in his carriage and manner far above his birth or circumstances  The   215 King of France  ever attentive to sow the seeds of division in England  received him at his court  and gave him proper encouragement  but  at the intercession of Henry  dismissed him  upon the prospect of a peace  Having quitted France  Perkin went to seek protection from the Duchess of Burgundy  taking the greatest care to conceal his former acquaintance  At their first meeting  the Duchess pretended much displeasure at his assurance  in assuming the title of her nephew  but soon after  as if brought over by conviction  she owned him for the Duke of York  and gave him a guard suitable to that dignity  The English  ever ready to revolt  gave credit to this new imposture  and the young man s prudence  conversation  and deportment  served to confirm what their credulity had began  All that were disgusted with the King prepared to join him  but particularly those that were formerly Henry s favourites  and had contributed to place him on the throne  thinking their services could never be sufficiently repaid  were now the chief heads of the conspiracy  These were joined by numbers  some greedy of novelty  some blindly attached to their leaders  and some induced  by their desperate fortunes  to wish for a change   Whilst the King s enemies were thus combining to involve the kingdom in its former calamities  he himself was no less intent upon preventing the impending danger  He endeavoured to undeceive the people  first by shewing that the Duke of York was really dead  and by punishing his murderers  and next by tracing Perkin  the impostor  to his primitive meanness  the last of these projects was not easily executed  for Warbeck s parents and place of abode were so well concealed  that it was   216 almost impossible to come to a knowledge of them But Henry  at length  won over Sir Robert Clifford  who was then accompanying the impostor in Flanders  and had been entrusted with his and the Duchess s secrets  From Clifford the King learned  not only their designs  but the names of the conspirators  and had several of them arrested  his former lenity  however  did not exempt him from fresh ingratitude  he found that the Lord High Chamberlain  brother to the famous
