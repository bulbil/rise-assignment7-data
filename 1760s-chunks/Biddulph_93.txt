and to all human appearance with her own consent  was a material point gained  but the most important of all  and without which every thing else would be fruitless  was to get her to acknowlege  under her own hand  the injury she had done Mrs Arnold by her vile insinuations to her husband  This was the grand object of all my wishes  This  you will say  was difficult  I confess it did then appear so to me  I had not at first weighed all the consequences of my enterprize with that deliberation that I ought  The principal object I had in view  was the separating Mrs Gerrarde and Mr Arnold  and raising his indignation against her  on account of the apparent infidelity on her side  To say the truth  I had not considered what I was to do with her when I had her  Two things I had resolved on  the one was  not to let her return to England  the other  to provide for her in whatever way she would put it in my power  the devoting myself to her excepted   in such a manner as should leave her no room to reproach me with having injured her temporal welfare   During my illness  I had resolved all these things in my mind  the last  viz  the providing for Mrs Gerrarde  was not a matter in which I expected to meet many difficulties  the other appeared very formidable  Several methods presented themselves  but none of them    pleased me  and I rejected them one after the other  and  to tell you my mind honestly  I was almost resolved on using compulsion  and frightening the poor woman into compliance  for I preferred even this to artificial dealings  I had already used more than I could have possibly brought myself to on any other occasion in the world  and I think I should have threatened her with a nunnery  the bastile  or even an inquisition  sooner than have failed  if she herself had not beyond expectation  beyond hope  almost beyond the evidence of my senses  led me as it were to request the thing of her  which of all others I most despaired of her consenting to  or even hearing proposed with patience  And yet  notwithstanding the seeming strangeness of this  it was nothing but what was very natural  and most consonant to her own designs  Blinded  and  as I may say  infatuated by vanity  she imagined  that as I had taken such uncommon pains to obtain her  I must love her with an uncommon degree of passion  and that her steadily refusing any dishonourable proposals  might induce me  rather than lose her  to make her my wife   In order to prepare me the better for this  no means were more natural  than for her to assume the air of a penitent  to seem sorry and ashamed of her past sins  and resolve on a virtuous course for the future  At the worst  that is  if she found I was not disposed to be as virtuous as herself  she knew she might play an after game  and could easily relax by degrees from the severity of her chastity  accordingly as I made it worth her while   This was the master key to her behaviour  and once I had got it  which I soon did  it was easy to unlock her breast   She came into my room the next morning without an invitation  and only the previous ceremony of sending Rachael to enquire how I did  and to tell me  if I were well enough to rise  observe her nicety   she would sit half an hour with me  I had enjoyed such tranquility of heart since my last conference with her  and had rested so well the preceding night  that I found myself quite another thing from what I was the day before  and  excepting a little weakness  I was as well as ever I was in my life  I was up and dressed  and you may be sure sent a suitable answer to her kind message  which soon brought the lady  sailing with an imperial port  into my chamber  After some civilities past on both sides  she  by way of bringing her own interests on the tapis  re assumed the topic of our yesterday’s conversation   You can’t imagine  Mr Faulkland  said she  how easy I am in my    mind  since I have reconciled myself to the loss of Mr Arnold  I own I had a regard for him  but I think it had more of gratitude than love in it  for though he is an agreeable man  to say the truth  he never was quite to my taste  he always had something too formal about him   I took the liberty to ask her  how she first came acquainted with Mr Arnold  and  as you may not know it  I will give you the story  She answered  with a profound sigh  It was by mere accident I first saw him  After the death of Captain Gerrarde  which happened in a little more than a year after we left Bath  for the gout  poor man  got into his stomach not long after we returned home
