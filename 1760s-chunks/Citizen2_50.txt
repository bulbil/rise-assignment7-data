in which we first had existence  that nothing but it can please  whatever vicissitudes we experience in life  however we toil  or wheresoever we wander  our fatigued wishes still recur to home for tranquillity  we long to die in that spot which gave us birth  and in that pleasing expectation opiate every calamity   You now therefore perceive that I have some intentions of leaving this country  and yet my designed departure fills me with reluctance and regret  Though the friendships of travellers are generally more transient than vernal snows  still I feel an uneasiness at breaking the connections I have formed since my arrival  particularly I shall have no small pain in leaving my usual companion  guide  and instructor   I shall wait for the arrival of my son before I set out  He shall be my companion in every intended journey for the future  in his company I can support the fatigues of the way with redoubled ardour  pleased at once with conveying instruction  and exacting obedience   Adieu     154  LETTER CI  From Lien Chi Altangi  to Fum Hoam  first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin  in China   OUR scholars of China have a most profound veneration for forms  A first rate beauty never studied the decorums of dress with more assiduity  they may properly enough be said to be cloathed with wisdom from head to foot  they have their philosophical caps and philosophical whiskers  their philosophical slippers and philosophical fans  there is even a philosophical standard for measuring the nails  and yet  with all this seeming wisdom  they are often found to be mere empty pretenders   A philosophical beau is not so frequent in Europe  yet I am told that such characters are found here  I mean such as punctually support all the decorums of learning  without being really very profound  or naturally possessed of a fine understanding  who labour hard to obtain the titular honours attending literary merit  who flatter others  in order to be flattered in turn  and only study to be thought students   A character of this kind generally receives company in his study  in all the pensive formality of slippers  night gown  and easy chair  The table is covered with a large book  which is always kept open  and never read  his solitary hours being dedicated to dozing  mending pens  feeling his pulse  peeping through the microscope  and sometimes reading amusing books  which he condemns in company  His library is preserved   155 with the most religious neatness  and is generally a repository of scarce books  which bear an high price  because too dull or useless to become common by the ordinary methods of publication   Such men are generally candidates for admittance into literary clubs  academies  and institutions  where they regularly meet to give and receive a little instruction and a great deal of praise  In conversation they never betray ignorance  because they never seem to receive information  Offer a new observation  they have heard it before  pinch them in an argument  and they reply with a sneer   Yet how trifling soever these little arts may appear  they answer one valuable purpose  of gaining the practisers the esteem they wish for  The bounds of a man s knowledge are easily concealed  if he has but prudence  but all can readily see and admire a gilt library  a set of long nails  a silver standish  or a well combed whisker  who are incapable of distinguishing a dunce   When Father Matthew  the first European Missioner  entered China  the court was informed  that he possessed great skill in astronomy  he was therefore sent for  and examined  The established astronomers of state undertook this task  and made their report to the Emperor  that his skill was but very superficial  and no way comparable to their own  The Missioner  however  appealed from their judgment to experience  and challenged them to calculate an eclipse of the moon that was to happen a few nights following   What  said some  shall a Barbarian  without nails  pretend to vie with   156 men in astronomy  who have made it the study of their lives  with men who know half the knowable characters of words  who wear scientifical caps and slippers  and who have gone through every literary degree with applause   They accepted the challenge  confident of success  The eclipse began  the Chinese produced a most splendid apparatus  and were fifteen minutes wrong  the Missioner  with a single instrument  was exact to a second  This was convincing  but the court astronomers were not to be convinced  instead of acknowledging their error  they assured the Emperor  that their calculations were certainly exact  but that the stranger  without nails  had actually bewitched the moon  Well then  cries the good Emperor  smiling at their ignorance  you shall still continue to be servants of the moon  but I constitute this man her Controller   China is thus replete with men  whose only pretensions to knowledge arise from external circumstances  and in Europe every country abounds with them in proportion to its ignorance  Spain and Flanders  who are behind the rest of Europe in learning  at least three centuries  have twenty literary titles and
