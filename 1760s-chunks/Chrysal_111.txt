or else fall upon improper subjects  This ingenious  ex    pedient has given rise to those meetings at the houses of the greatest   fashion  which  from the noise  bustle  and confusion inseparable   from such crowds  are emphatically called routs  In these  the   mistress of the house always presides  and  consequently  attendance   at them is looked upon as a compliment peculiar to her  and in   which her husband has no share  For this reason  the greater the   crowd collected the more important the entertainer appears  and   therefore no pains or expense is spared in inducing them to attend      From the character already given of the wife of this gentleman    it may be concluded that she exerted all her efforts to make a figure   by the frequency and greatness of her own routs  and by the pro    fusion with which she gamed away her money at those of others    However  the mode was become so universal and so eagerly pursued   that she soon found it was impossible for her to distinguish herself   in the manner she desired if she could not strike out some new way    But in this she was not long at a loss   the boldness of her genius   prompted her to try an expedient which no one before her had   dared to venture upon      This was to fix her routs on the day set apart  by laws human and   divine  for the duties of religion   and which till then had been held   sacred to these alone  from every kind of business and recreation    So bold a stroke necessarily attracted the notice of the public  and   the remissness of the legislature overlooking it  the crowds who    from an insensibility to those duties  were utterly at a loss how   to get rid of so much time  gladly embraced such an opportunity    and flocked to her in numbers that amply satisfied her ambition    Such success and impunity soon made her example imitated   but    as she had led the way  the merit of that secured her from being   supplanted by any rival  and having her company decoyed from her      The circumstances of her husband s birth  and the principles in   which he had been educated  made him at first look upon such an   insult upon religion with the strongest horror   but she made light   of his scruples  and overruled all his objections with such an ab    solute authority  that  for the sake of peace  he was obUged to   submit  and join in what he dared not contradict  till he has at   length forfeited the acquaintance of every serious  rational  and   religious person      He was at first greatly affected at this falling off  and much dis    tressed to think what it could proceed from  as he was not sensible   of any deviation  in his own sentiments  from the principles which   had made his acquaintance sought by every man of sense and   virtue   but an accident soon opened his eyes to the absurdity   of his situation      The acquaintance on which he justly set the greatest value  was   with a prelate of distinguished merit and virtue  an intimate friend   of his deceased father  With him he spent the happiest hours of   his life   and  in the wisdom and piety of his conversation  found   relief for the sick heart  from the follies and riotous excesses which   he was a slave to at home  Though he always met with the most         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 115     benevolent and friendly reception from tliis worthy person  yet   the coolness with which he found himself treated by some others    made his apprehension so ready to take alarm  that  upon his grace   not returning a visit or two with the exactest punctuality  either   from sickness or some necessary engagement  he could not help   expressing his uneasiness with such warmth  when he went to see   him next  that his grace  who  though he despised ceremony  would   not give pain or offence to any person  especially one for whom he   had so sincere an esteem  accoimted for his late omission  by giving   the real reason of it  and told him that he would do himself the   pleasure of visiting him any day when he might be sure of finding   him at home      The gentleman answered that if his grace would appoint any   day agreeable and convenient to him  he would gladly break through   all engagements  and attend to receive him  This was a strain   of complaisance which the prelate would not agree to  but insisted   upon knowing what day he was usually at home
