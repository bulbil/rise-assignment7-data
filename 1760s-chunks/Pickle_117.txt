suspecting at first that the whole was the creation of his own brain   but when Pickle  with a view of flattering the doctor s self conceit   espoused his side of the question  and confirmed the truth of everything  he advanced  Mr  Pallet changed his opinion  and in emphatic silence  adored the immensity of his friend s understanding  In short  Peregrine  easily perceived that they were false enthusiasts  without the smallest  pretensions to taste and sensibility  and pretended to be in raptures  with they knew not what  the one thinking it was incumbent upon him  to express transports on seeing the works of those who had been most    6 22 15  3 45 PM   eminent in their profession  whether they did or did not really raise  his admiration  and the other as a scholar deeming it his duty to  magnify the ancients above all competition  with an affected fervour   which the knowledge of their excellencies never inspired  Indeed  our  young gentleman so successfully accommodated himself to the disposition  of each  that long before their review was finished  he was become a  particular favourite with both   From the Palais Royal he accompanied them to the cloisters of the  Carthusian s  where they considered the History of St  Bruno  by Le  Sueur  whose name being utterly unknown to the painter  he gave judgment  against the whole composition  as pitiful and paltry  though  in the  opinion of all good judges  it is a most masterly performance   Having satisfied their curiosity in this place  Peregrine asked them  to favour him with their company at dinner  but whether out of caution  against the insinuations of one whose character they did not know  or by  reason of a prior engagement  they declined his invitation on pretence  of having an appointment at a certain ordinary  though they expressed  a desire of being further acquainted with him  and Mr  Pallet took the  freedom of asking his name  which he not only declared  but promised   as they were strangers in Paris  to wait upon them next day in the  forenoon  in order to conduct them to the Hotel de Toulouse  and the  houses of several other noblemen  remarkable for painting or curious  furniture  They thankfully embraced his proposal  and that same day made  inquiry among the English gentlemen about the character of our hero   which they found so much to their satisfaction  that  upon their second  meeting  they courted his good graces without reserve  and as they had  heard of his intended departure  begged earnestly to have the honour of  accompanying him through the Low Countries  He assured them that  nothing could be more agreeable to him than the prospect of having such  fellow travellers  and they immediately appointed a day for setting out  on that tour   CHAPTER XLIII   He introduces his new Friends to Mr  Jolter  with whom the Doctor enters  into a Dispute upon Government  which had well nigh terminated in open  War   Meanwhile  he not only made them acquainted with everything worth seeing  in town but attended them in their excursions to all the king s houses  within a day s journey of Paris  and in the course of these parties   treated them with an elegant dinner at his own apartments  where a  dispute arose between the doctor and Mr  Jolter  which had well nigh  terminated in an irreconcilable animosity  These gentlemen  with an  equal share of pride  pedantry  and saturnine disposition  were  by the  accidents of education and company  diametrically opposite in  political maxims  the one  as we have already observed  being a bigoted  high churchman  and the other a rank republican  It was an article of  the governor s creed  that the people could not be happy  nor the earth  yield its fruits in abundance  under a restricted clergy and limited    6 22 15  3 45 PM   government  whereas  in the doctor s opinion  it was an eternal truth   that no constitution was so perfect as the democracy  and that no  country could flourish but under the administration of the mob   These considerations being premised  no wonder that they happened to  disagree in the freedom of an unreserved conversation  especially as  their entertainer took all opportunities of encouraging and inflaming  the contention  The first source of their difference was an unlucky  remark of the painter  who observed that the partridge  of which he was  then eating  had the finest relish of any he had ever tasted  His friend  owned that the birds were the best of the kind he had seen in France   but affirmed that they were neither so plump nor delicious as those that  were caught in England  The governor  considering this observation as  the effect of prejudice and inexperience  said  with a sarcastic smile    I believe  sir  you are very well disposed to find everything here  inferior to the productions of your own country     True  sir   answered  the physician
