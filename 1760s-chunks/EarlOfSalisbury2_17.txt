that unmerited  severity with which he pursued our generous friend  Peace and  forgiveness to his departed spirit —If thou hast already heard how the  hunted fugitive ranged through the wild and desart mountains  spare me  the odious recital  yes  thou must have heard  Thy brave Countrymen  who  long defended him  must have at length found their Lord  Their valour  only could have rescued thee from the snares of envy and cruelty  And   may due honour and reward attend that Fidelity  which guarded the  unhappy devoted head of Les Roches  Long time they watched over him in  his melancholy retreat  nor was it their want of vigilance  but his own  absence of thought and careless inattention to danger  which at last  separated him from their protection      It  was on the morning of a night of broken and disordered slumbers  that  the unhappy Lord started from his hard couch  full of inward grief  and  agitation  The woody covert where he had sought repose  at first  concealed his motions from the Englishmen  who watched at some  distance  Insensibly was he led on  wrapt up in sad and painful  reflection  and wandered solitary down the winding path  which led from  the mountain  was divided  and gradually lost in a vale incumbered with  shrubs and rocks  and watered by a resounding current  At length  he  awakened as from a dream  stared round on the awful prospect  and sought  to gain his companions  But  alas  he had wandered too far  and too  incautiously  Perplexed and confounded  encompassed with steep hills   which the luxuriant hand of nature had cloathed with a wild  magnificence of forest  and  ever and anon  diverted from his course by  the rocky fragments which the torrent seemed to have washed down into  the valley  his eyes searched in vain for the path which he had taken   he hasted on  and paused by turns  without direction  nor totally free  from terror  when suddenly he descried a venerable personage  clad in  the habit of austere piety  on which the silver beard descended from a  grave and emaciated visage  The hermit advanced  raising his shrivelled  hands in holy benediction over our astonished friend  and  as Les Roches  bowed before him  he enquired with surprize what fate or chance had led  him into this rude and solitary retreat     The afflicted Lord  awed by his reverend aspect  yet comforted by that  benevolence which beamed forth from his looks  and softened all his  accents  freely acknowledged that he was the wretched child of calamity   driven to the desart by persecution and oppression  and that he sought  the neighbouring hills  where a few friends  the two sharers in his  misfortune  waited his return  The reverend father  who saw his anguish   comforted  exhorted  and  by degrees so far gained on his confidence  that he freely acknowledged  his name and quality  and briefly related the events which had driven  him from the society of men  The hermit was moved  and  pointing to his  cell  which lay at no great distance  There  said he  shalt thou find  refuge   till these storms of calamity have wasted their violence   Come  on  my son  enter and partake of my homely refreshment  your  friends too shall be my care  Tarry there  I know all the windings and  secret paths of these unfrequented hills  I shall soon find them  and  here shall they enjoy a more secure  and  perhaps  less uncomfortable  retreat  The Baron made obeisance  and accepted the generous  invitation  The hermit laboured up the precipice with slow and painful  steps  towards the place which Les Roches had described  but here he  found no unhappy strangers  all was silence and solitude  He returned  full of fears and sad forebodings  which his tenderness of nature had  dictated  He entered his cave  but this too was silent and solitary  no  guest appeared  no afflicted Lord waited his arrival     However cautiously Les Roches had directed his course  however secret  and retired he had chosen his residence  still had his motions been long  watched by some base and ignoble men  allured by the rewards promised  to those who should discover and seize him  Four sordid hinds  disguised  in the garb of wood men  had diligently traced him thro  all his various  progress  but still were terrified and kept at wary distance by the  vigilance and well known valour of his attendants  The moment of his  separation had not escaped them  they exulted  and resolved to seize  this critical occasion  They pursued his steps  and hastened down to the  valley by different routs to them well known —They lay unnoticed   impatient to snatch their prey  they marked the late conference  and saw  the hermit depart  and no sooner was he lost in the distant wood  than  rushing furiously into the cave  and drawing  their concealed weapons  they
