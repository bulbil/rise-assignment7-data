our  hero  who had covered such a damnable scheme with the mask of religion   In short  he performed his cue with such dexterity  that the lady   believing him to be in earnest  begged he would forgive the stranger on  account of his youth and education  which had been tainted by the errors  of heresy  and he was on these considerations content to accept the  submission of our hero  who  far from renouncing his expectations   notwithstanding this mortifying repulse  confided so much in his  own talents  and the confession which his mistress had made  that he  resolved to make another effort  to which nothing could have prompted  him but the utmost turbulence of unruly desire   CHAPTER LIV    He makes another Effort to towards the Accomplishment of his Wish  which  is postponed by a strange Accident   He directed his valet de chambre  who was a thorough paced pimp   to kindle some straw in the yard  and then pass by the door of her  apartment  crying with a loud voice that the house was on fire   This alarm brought both ladies out of their chamber in a moment  and  Peregrine  taking the advantage of their running to the street door   entered the room  concealed himself under a large table that stood in an  unobserved corner  The nymphs  as soon as they understood the cause  of his Mercury s supposed affright  returned to their apartment  and   having said their prayers  undressed themselves  and went to bed     6 22 15  3 45 PM   This scene  which fell under the observation of Pickle  did not at all  contribute to the cooling of his concupiscence  but on the contrary  inflamed him to such a degree  that he could scarce restrain his  impatience  until  by her breathing deep  he concluded the fellow lodger  of his Amanda was asleep  This welcome note no sooner saluted his ears   than he crept to his charmer s bedside  and placing himself on his  knees  gently laid hold on her white hand  and pressed it to his lips   She had just begun to close her eyes  and enjoy the agreeable oppression  of slumber  when she was roused by this rape  at which she started   pronouncing  in a tone of surprise and dismay   My God  who s that    The lover  with the most insinuating humility  besought her to hear him   vowing that his intention  in approaching her thus  was not to violate  the laws of decency  or that indelible esteem which she had engraved on  his heart  but to manifest his sorrow and contrition for the umbrage he  had given  to pour forth the overflowings of his soul  and tell her that  he neither could nor would survive her displeasure  These and many  more pathetic protestations  accompanied with sighs and tears and other  expressions of grief  which our hero had at command  could not fail to  melt the tender heart of the Fleming  already prepossessed in favour of  his qualifications  She sympathized so much with his affliction  as  to weep in her turn  when she represented the impossibility of her  rewarding his passion  and he  seizing the moment  reinforced his  solicitations with such irresistible transports  that her resolution  gave way  she began to breathe quick  expressed her fear of being  overheard by the other lady  with an ejaculation of  O heavens  I m  undone   suffered him  after a faint struggle  to make a lodgment upon  the covered way of her bed  Her honour  however  was secured for the  present  by a strange sort of knocking upon the wainscot  at the other  end of the room  hard by the bed in which the female adventurer lay   Surprised at this circumstance  the lady begged him for heaven s sake  to retreat  or her reputation would be ruined for ever  but when he  represented to her  that her character would run a much greater risk  if he should be detected in withdrawing  she consented  with great  trepidation  to his stay  and they listened in silence to the sequel of  the noise that alarmed them  This was no other than an expedient of the  painter to awaken his dulcinea  with whom he had made an assignation   or at least interchanged such signals as he thought amounted to a firm  appointment  His nymph  being disturbed in her first sleep  immediately  understood the sound  and  true to the agreement  rose  and  unbolting  the door  as softly as possible  gave him admittance  leaving it open  for his more commodious retreat   While this happy gallant was employed in disengaging himself from  the deshabille in which he had entered  the Capuchin  suspecting that  Peregrine would make another attempt upon his charge  had crept silently  to the apartment in order to reconnoitre  lest the adventure should be  achieved without his knowledge  a circumstance that would deprive him  of the profits he might expect from his
