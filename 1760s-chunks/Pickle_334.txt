 than me this morning   The fellow  though a valet de chambre  blushed at  this observation  and I withdrew  not a little irritated at the peer s  disingenuity  and fully resolved to spare him my visits for the future   It was not long after this occasion  that I happened to meet him in  the park  and being naturally civil  I could not pass him without a  salutation of the hat  which he returned in the most distant manner   though we were both solitary  and not a soul within view  and when that  very performance  which he had applauded so warmly  was lately published  by subscription  he did not bespeak so much as one copy  I have often  reflected with wonder upon this inconsistency of his conduct  I never  courted his patronage  nor indeed thought of his name  until he  made interest for my acquaintance  and if he was disappointed in my  conversation  why did he press me so much to further connection     The case is very clear   cried the chairman  interrupting him   he is  one of those connoisseurs who set up for taste  and value themselves  upon knowing all men of genius  whom they would be thought to assist  in their productions  I will lay an even bet with any man  that his  lordship on the strength of that slender interview  together with the  opportunity of having seen your performance in manuscript  has already  hinted to every company in which he is conversant  that you solicited  his assistance in retouching the piece  which you have now offered to  the public  and that he was pleased to favour you with his advice   but found you obstinately bigoted to your own opinion  in some points  relating to those very passages which have not met with the approbation  of the town  As for his caresses  there was nothing at all extraordinary  in his behaviour  By that time you have lived to my age  you will not  be surprised to see a courtier s promise and performance of a different  complexion  not but that I would willingly act as an auxiliary in your  resentment    The opinion of the president was strengthened by the concurrence of all  the members  and all other complaints and memorials being deferred till  another sitting  the college proceeded to an exercise of wit  which was  generally performed once every fortnight  with a view to promote the  expectoration of genius  The subject was occasionally chosen by the  chairman  who opened the game with some shrewd remark naturally arising  from the conversation  and then the ball was tossed about  from one  corner of the room to the other  according to the motions of the spirit     6 22 15  3 45 PM   That the reader may have a just idea of this sport  and of the abilities  of those who carried it on  I shall repeat the sallies of this evening   according to the order and succession in which they escaped  One of the  members observing that Mr  Metaphor was absent  was told by the person  who sat next to him  that the poet had foul weather at home  and could  not stir abroad   What   said the president  interposing  with the  signal upon his countenance   is he wind bound  in port     Wine bound   I suppose   cried another   Hooped with wine  a strange metaphor   said  the third   Not if he has got into a hogshead   answered the fourth    The hogshead will sooner get into him   replied a fifth   it must be a  tun or an ocean     No wonder then  if he should be overwhelmed   said  a sixth   If he should   cried a seventh   he will cast up when his gall  breaks     That must be very soon   roared an eighth   for it has been  long ready to burst    No  no   observed a ninth   he ll stick fast  at the bottom  take my word for it  he has a natural alacrity in  sinking     And yet   remarked a tenth   I have seen him in the  clouds     Then was he cloudy  I suppose   cried the eleventh    So dark   replied the other   that his meaning could not be  perceived     For all that   said the twelfth   he is easily seen  through     You talk   answered the thirteenth   as if his head was made  of glass     No  no   cried the fourteenth   his head is made of more  durable stuff  it will bend before it breaks     Yet I have seen it  broken   resumed the president   Did you perceive any wit come out  at the whole   said another   His wit
