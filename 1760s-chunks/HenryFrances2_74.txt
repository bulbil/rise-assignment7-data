your sweet ante loved Babe  I was  from some prior Reasons  directed to this particular Place  for both   Let me indulge myself farther in the Contemplation of this Scheme of Providence  with regard to you and me  You chose and approved of me  when you had before you  as Milton says    The World to chuse  and Providence your Guide   Sense  Wit  and Reading were  from my earliest Years  the Objects of my implicit Adoration  and  whenever I changed my Passion  it was in Search of a fit Subject for my Admiration  I  at length  possessed  unknowing  these rare Qualities in you  and was in Danger   like the base Indian  to throw a Pearl away  richer Page  280 than all my Tribe   But  as my Reason improved by your charming Converse more than my own Reflection  I found  acknowledged  and incased the Gem  thou  one entire and perfect Chrysolite   and hope never to exchange thee  but for a better World than this  made more eminently so  by a nobler and higher Converse there with thee  thou amiable Cherubim and Seraphim in one  in whom are so perfectly joined their two distinguishing Characteristics  Love and Knowledge  the pleasing Hope of which Enjoyment above will be a stronger Incitement to my Virtue here below  In short  I do not know two Persons alive  who seem more adapted by Nature for each other  Excuse this Vanity in me  when your Approbation has already made my Panegyric  My Calmness and Philosophy is fit to temper the Misfortunes and Disappointments of Life  and your Wit and Spirit proper to season and enliven the Ease or Pleasures of it   Dull  tasteless all  if unenjoy d by thee     Farewell  thou best Subject of my best Comments   Henry   Page  281  LETTER CCXCV   My Dear FANNY   I DRANK hard at —  and it is now too late to reach home  However  I might get as far as —  with Ease  but have stopped short here  that I might be at Liberty to think of  and write to you  more agreeable to me than any Company or Converse  I can meet with in this World  while my Back is turned to you   I received a very pretty Letter from you last Post  a very generous and a kind one too  The fatal Necessity of my too long Absence from you is sufficiently irksome in itself  and the sensible Light in which you apprehend it  and the rational Manner you speak of it in  saves me that additional Weight of Anxiety  which would be intolerable  You can always command Sense and Reason enough  when you are Mistress of yourself  and  in Obedience to them  let me be proud to own myself your Vassal too   The Comments  I expect from you  upon those Writings  and others of the same Class  which I have recommended to you  are best shewn in your Life  by Chearfulness and Content  the first manifested in Philosophy  and the latter in Resignation  Whenever I sit down to Page  282 read any Writings of this Kind  I first suppose myself  in order to try their Power  labouring under all the Ills of Sickness  Sorrow  Poverty  and Oppression  When  in a short Time  all these gloomy Cares are dispelled  like Mists before the enlivening Sun beams  and I look back first  with Triumph  and Contempt upon those fleeting Shadows  which are now posting so far behind me  and then look forward  with Gratitude and Joy  to that glorious Prospect wide opening before me  In short  there is but one Misfortune in Life  which I think could prove too hard for such Reflections as these to support me through  I mean the Loss of thee  of thee  my only Gain  And I am very certain  that nothing could prevent me from following you precipitately  but the Fear  by that rash Action  of losing you for ever   Among the Papers  which I design to collect in my Solamen miseris  I would insert the Hymn to Contentment  and Night piece on Death  of Parnell s  I happened to read them both this Morning  at Kitty s  and  if it would not appear too much Vanity  I would add some of my Letters to you  where I speak of the Providence and Mercy of God  and the Immortality of the Soul  which  as they are my own Reflections  might have a better Effect on myself  at least  than better Writings on the same Subjects  A Collection of Essays  intitled Spectacle de la Page  283 Nature  occurs to me here  as they give you a general and comprehensive View of natural Philosophy  which is such a Manifestation of a God infinitely wise  powerful  and good  as — away all impious Thoughts  — almost renders particular Revelation superfluous  at least  to contemplative Minds  There are also many Passages in these Writings  especially two Letters from the Prior to the Chevalier  which are masterly in their Kind  that are admirable to abate the Self sufficiency of Man s
