a happy facility in bending  This remark    119 Charles  is not the consequence of an idle speculation  In the course of my own experience  I have frequently found it existing in reality  when I first commenced life  I have been the most uneasy fellow in the world at the conclusion of an amour  lest the distraction in which I saw the unfortunate fair one absorbed  should force her into some desperate extremity  yet how have I stared with astonishment  when  in the short circle of a few hours  the self same miserable nymph  who was prostrate at my feet  and tearing her hair with all the phrensy of an extravagant passion  has appeared in the side box  or the drawing room  with as perfect a composure upon her features  as if her tender bosom had never undergone the smallest agitation  On this account  therefore  I flatter myself  that Miss Mildmay s uneasiness will very speedily wear off  especially as her secret will rest in a   120 manner with herself  and as she herself also has the credit of the rejection   I shall by this day s post write to lady Haversham  That woman  Charles  has a soul that strikes against the stars  and excites  in the midst of all the brother s familiarity  a something that commands my highest admiration  Notwithstanding all your peculiarities  you are one of her greatest favourites  call upon her therefore immediately on the receipt of this  and let me as immediately know what she says of my breach with Miss Mildmay  I shall stay at this place till I receive your answer  where I shall go next must be a matter of farther consideration  though where  would be a matter of no consequence  as I am heartily weary of myself  were it not that I am  in spite of all my indifference to the world  your ever faithful  R  HAROLD     121  LETTER IX  Mr  CHARLES MELMOTH  to Sir ROBERT HAROLD   I Do not know how it is  Harold  but  notwithstanding my general disregard of women  you have interested me strangely in favour of Miss Mildmay  and this unaccountable delicacy of your s in breaking off with a lady  merely because she has given you the most convincing proof of her affection  is what  in my opinion  savours considerably more of romance than of real understanding  To embrace a certain misery for fear of a misfortune which is never likely to happen  may perhaps  make you the hero of a very pretty novel  but must  in actual life  expose you to the unremiting ridicule of every body who is trusted with your secret  however  as the die   122 is irrecoverably cast  and as I do not see that the generous girl could be prevailed upon to have you  were you even to sneak back to her father s house in as pitiful a manner as you left it  I shall throw away as few of my reflections as possible  upon a fellow who acts in manifest repugnance to the sentiments both of his reason and his honour  and is willing to become a rascal in the eyes of the wise and the worthy  for fear the ignorant or the profligate should set him down as a fool   Agreeable to the desire of your letter  I had no sooner looked over the contents than I set out to your sister s  but  instead of being immediately ushered up stairs  according to custom  the servant told me that his lady had been excessively ill the whole day  and given orders against the admittance of any visitors   however  Sir   says the honest man      123as it is you  I ll call Mrs  Harper  her ladyship s woman  who will probably give you a more satisfactory answer    Harper accordingly came down to me  and  with a look of mingled grief and impatience  asked me if you were come to town  I replied in the negative  and enquired  if I might not speak a word or two with her lady    Yes to be sure  Sir  answered she  though I do not believe she would see any other person in the kingdom   On this she led me up stairs  and there I found your sister with a letter before her  which she afterwards informed me came from Mrs  Mildmay  It was easy to see that lady Haversham had been weeping much  her eyes were prodigiously swelled  and there was an uncommon paleness over her whole face  which sufficiently indicated both indisposition and distress       124You know how little she stands upon ceremony with me—she pointed therefore to a chair near her own  and waving with her hand to Harper  as a signal to withdraw  she burst into a violent flood of tears  As I had but too much reason to guess the cause of her perturbation  and was sensible that talking in her present circumstances would only add to her affliction  I waited without ever opening my lips till she had somewhat recovered herself  and was a little able to enter upon a conversation   After her tears had procured her some relief  she turned to me with an air of unspeakable dejection
