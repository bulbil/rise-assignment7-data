his arm  and his dada  as he called him  and   he  returned to their old recreations      As Harry s ideas began to open and expand  he grew ambitious   of greater power and knowledge  He wished for the strength of   that bull  and for the swiftness of yonder horse   and on the close   of a solemn and serene summer s evening  while he and his patron   walked in the garden  he wished for wings  that he might fly up   and see what the sky  and the stars  and the rising moon  were   made of      In order to reform this inordinancy of his desires  his patron ad    dressed him in the following manner       I will tell you a story  my Harry  On the other side of yonder   hill there runs a mighty clear river  and in that river  on a time    there lived three silver trouts the prettiest little fishes that any   one ever saw  Now  God took a great liking and love to these   pretty silver trouts  and he let them want for nothing that such   little fishes could have occasion for   but two of them grew sad and   discontented  and the one wished for this thing  and the other   wished for that thing  and neither of them could take pleasure in   any thing that they had  because they were always longing for   something that they had not      Now  Harry  you must know that all this was very naughty in   those two little trouts  for God had been exceedingly kind to them     he had given them every thing that was fittest for them  and he   never grudged them any thing that was for their good  but  in    stead of thanking him for all his care and his kindness  they blamed   him in their own minds for refusing them any thing that their   silly fancies were set upon   in short  there was no end of their   wishing  and longing  and quarrelling in their hearts  for this thing   and the other      At last God was so provoked  that he resolved to punish their   naughtiness by granting their desires  and to make the folly of   those two little stubborn trouts an example to all the foolish fish   in the whole world      For this purpose  he called out to the three little silver trouts    and told them they should have whatever they wished for      Now the eldest of these trouts was a very proud little fish  and   wanted  forsooth  to be set up above all other little fishes  May   it please your greatness  says he  I must be free to tell you that   I do not  at all  like the way in which you have placed me  Here      ou have put me into a poor  narrow  and troublesome river  where   am straitened on the right side  and straitened on the left side    and can neither get down into the ground  nor up into the air  nor   go where  nor do any thing I have a mind to do  I am not so   blind  for all  but that I can see well enough how mighty kind and   bountiful you can be to others  There are your favourite little   birds  who fly this way and that way  and mount up to the very         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  9     heavens  and do whatever they please  and have every thing at   command  because you have given them wings  Give me such   wings also as you have given to them  and then I shall have some    thing for which I ought to thank you      No sooner ask than have  He felt the wings he wished for   growing from either side  and  in a minute  he spread them abroad    and rose out of the water  At first he felt a wonderful pleasure   in finding himself able to fly  He mounted high into the air  above   the very clouds  and he looked down with scorn on all the fishes   in the world      He now resolved to travel  and to take his diversion far and   wide  He flew over rivers and meadows  and woods and moun    tains   till  growing faint with hunger and thirst  his wings began   to fail him  and he thought it best to come down to get some re    freshment      The little fool did not consider that he was now in a strange   country  and many a mile from the sweet river where he was born   and
