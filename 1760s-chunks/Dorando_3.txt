  But Providence  whose awful designs cannot be penetrated by mortals  Page  17  —Providence  who is sometimes pleased to manifest his justice  even in this world of imperfection  where we are not always to expect it—Providence determined to reward the piety of the princess Maria ← Dorando →   by rescuing her memory from reproach  and vindicating the honour of her son by means the most extraordinary   Not far from the castle of Dorando was the seat of a knight  who claimed a distant connection with the illustrious house  having the honour to bear the name  but he was never allowed to approach the castle  as he was well known to be inviolably attached to the family from whence he sprung  and had even fought several duels with persons who said in his presence  that the lady Maria had brought home supposititious children   Page  18  The daughter of this knight was Donna Eleanora  of uncommon talents  and all the high spirit of her race  Her brother was an officer in the service of Naples  during the monarchy of Don Carlos  when king of the two Sicilies  and as the prince of ← Dorando → had been baptized the same day with his majesty  received the same name  and been ever intimate with him  Donna Eleanora determined to solicite his interest in favour of her brother  and as Stocaccio was just dead  she resolved to improve a favourable interval   She accordingly went to the castle  and was allowed admittance to the prince —← Dorando → rose and received her with an easy dignity  as if he had not been a day absent from court    Fair lady  said he  how am I so fortunate —To whom am I indebted  Page  19  for so agreeable a visit    Donna Eleanora told him her name and Family  and why she had presumed to come into his presence  and she spoke with such openness and unaffected vivacity  that the prince was charmed with her behaviour —told her that she might command his services in every thing  and that he would the very next morning dispatch a special courier to Naples  with the strongest recommendations of her brother to his Sicilian majesty  He insisted that she should stay with him a day or two  and very pleasantly said    I hope  cousin  you are not afraid of being eaten alive by the wild man  God forbid  Sir  said Donna Eleanora  that I  whose veins are warm with the blood of ← Dorando →   should be affected by such imaginations  I am a woman  but  I hope  I am free  Page  20  from the weaknesses which render our sex contemptible —Will your highness allow me to see the castle      The prince conducted her through the apartments with the most courteous affability  Donna Eleanora admired their grandeur  but her attention was chiefly fixed on the portraits of the renowned heroes of the house of ← Dorando →     Ah prince  said she  is it not sacrilege to let so glorious a sun set for ever —Your highness will forgive me for mentioning the name of the lady Maria —My tears must plead my excuse    —The prince fetched a deep sigh  and stood for a minute or two as if looking towards heaven  but made no reply  Donna Eleanora assumed a gayer tone —   Well then  prince  is there no lady in Spain who deserves the honour of having her picture placed  Page  21  in this gallery  Are women so degenerated  that the house of Dorando must fail for want of a consort    The prince kissed her hand  and walked a cross the room  as if he had something in his mind which he could not communicate  Donna Eleanora was not at all discomposed  Though she had heard many reports  that the prince was subject to furious fits  she considered them as the inventions of interested people  and she stood fearless and unconcerned  till he recovered from his reverie  and asking her ten thousand pardons  led her to the room where dinner was served up     Donna Eleanora appeared at table with such gracefulness and majesty  that the prince often fixed his eyes upon her  and then hastily withdrawing them  was heard to say —   This  Page  22  is strange —This is strange    —After dinner she was shewn to her apartment to take a siesto  or gentle sleep  as is the custom in Spain  She dreamed that a lady appeared to her with a celestial countenance  informing her  she was the princess Maria  and saying    Noble lady  I am come to tell you  that Donna Eleanora was born for the deliverance of my injured son      This vision left a wonderful impression on the mind of Donna Eleanora  she wist not well what to think of it —She rose and went to the drawing room  where she found the prince reclined on a sofa  and playing on the lute with inimitable taste  she begged that he would continue his music  of which she was very fond  The prince did so  and touched the instrument with such delicacy  that  Page  23  Donna Eleanora thought herself in an enchanted region
