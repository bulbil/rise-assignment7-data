 6 22 15  3 45 PM   situation extremely uneasy  on account of the perpetual wrangling which  prevailed between us  in consequence of his desiring to sleep with me  again  after we had parted beds for the second time  and  that I might  no longer be exposed to such disagreeable persecutions  I resolved to  leave him  though at the hazard of my life    Thus determined  I went to the British ambassador  in a hackney coach   and  in order to disguise my youth  which might have prepossessed him  against my judgment  muffled myself up in a black hood  which  as he  said  instead of lending an air of gravity to my countenance  added a  wildness to my looks  which was far from being disagreeable  He had  been a gallant man in his youth  and even then  though well stricken  in years  was not insensible to the power of beauty  This disposition   perhaps  rendered him more favourable to my cause  though he first  advised me to return to my husband  but finding me obstinate  he  undertook to serve me in my own way  and procured a protection from the  French king  by virtue of which I could live at Paris unmolested by my  lord  Nevertheless  he advised me  if I was determined to leave him  to  make the best of my way to England and sue for a divorce  I relished his  opinion  and concealed myself about three days in Paris  during which I  borrowed some linen  for  as it was impossible to convey anything out  of my own house without suspicion  I had neither clothes for my  accommodation  nor a servant to wait on me    In this solitary condition  I took the road to Flanders  after I had  put my lord upon a wrong scent  by writing a letter to him  dated at  Calais  and travelled through an unknown country  without any other  attendant than the postillion  being subjected to this inconvenience by  the laws of France  which are so severe in some particulars  that  if  any person had been apprehended with me  he would have suffered death  for going off with a man s wife  though any man might go to bed with  that same woman  without fear of incurring any legal punishment    I proceeded night and day without intermission  that I might the sooner  reach Flanders  where I knew I should be safe  and as the nights were  excessively cold  I was fain to wrap myself up in flannel  which  I bought for the purpose  as I had no clothes to keep me warm  and  travelled in an open chaise  While we passed through dreary woods  quite  remote from the habitations of men  I was not without apprehension of  being stripped and murdered by the postillion  and  in all probability   owed my safety to the indigence of my appearance  which might also  protect me in two miserable places  where I was obliged to lie  before  I got out of the territories of France  for  as I could not reach the  great towns where I intended to lodge  I was under the necessity of  putting up at little wretched hovels  where no provision was to be had   but sour brown bread  and sourer cheese  and everything seemed to denote  the dens of despair and assassination    I made shift  however  to subsist on this fare  uncomfortable as it  was  confiding on the meanness of my equipage for the security of my  person  and at length arriving at Brussels  fixed my quarters in the  Hotel de Flandre  so well known to the English since   where I thought  myself extremely happy in the accomplishment of my flight    I had not been two full days in this place  when I was blessed with the  sight of my lover  who followed me on the wings of love  in pursuance  of the plan we had projected before my departure from Paris  Here    6 22 15  3 45 PM   we concerted measures for proceeding to England  I hired a tall fine  Liegeoise for my maid  and setting out for Ostend  we embarked in a  vessel  in which Mr  S   had bespoke our passage  Our voyage was short  and prosperous  and our time most agreeably spent in the company of my  dear partner  who was a most engaging man in all respects  as I dare say  my Lady C   has since found him    I assumed a fictitious name  took private lodgings in Poland street   retained lawyers  and commenced a suit for separation against my lord   I communicated the reasons of my elopement to my father  who was shocked  and surprised at my conduct  which he condemned with expressions of  sorrow and resentment  But the step was taken  nor did I repent of what  I had done  except on his account    In the morning after my arrival at London  I
