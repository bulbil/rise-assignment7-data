reason given before    is not the necessary consequence of such merit  An attorney   or surgeon  for instance  who is not thought to have some merit   in his profession  will never be employed  but let him by any   means get into the Church  and curry favour with those in power    and he may rise to the first dignities of it  though he has no more   merit in his profession than he had in that which he was forced to   quit for want of bread  And this is the reason why they   who have least abilities for any profession are packed into this    and why they  again  who have the least of these  are generally   most successful in it  as consciousness of their want of merit makes   them take most pains to gain favour  The consequences of his   entering into such a profession against inclination are obvious    An indignant sense of his own natural superiority to his superiors   in station made him fall into the too common error of arguing from   the abuse  against the use  and hold in contempt not only them    but also the very profession itself  in which they could have such   success  and in which necessity alone obliged him to continue    He disdained to apply abilities which he thought above the end    He neglected duties which he saw abused  and at length sunk into   a state of listless indifference  in which he would have died in ob    scurity  had not distress roused him  and extorted an exertion   of his abilities which a mind soured by disappointment of its earliest   hopes  and by domestic unhappiness after  turned to satire  with   an asperity and strength that made vice tremble in the bosom of   the great  and folly Mde her head in the highest places  As this   domestic unhappiness was the immediate cause of those parts of   his conduct which contradicted the general tenor of his character    justice requires that some account should be given of it  In the   capricious levity of youth  he fixed his inclination on a female  who   had no other recommendation beside beauty  Prudence would   have forbidden a match  in which there was so little prospect of   happiness  but men of great abilities too often think it beneath   them to listen to her voice  He married her  though in the phrase   of the world  evidently to his ruin  the return she made him for   which proof of his love was infidelity to his bed  This is the deepest   wound that can be given to a heart of any delicacy   it sharpens   the sting of ingratitude with insult  by giving a preference that   reflects dishonour  He felt it so severely  that despair made him   strive to drown the sense of it in wine  in the intoxication of which   he too often was guilty of what  in a cooler moment  his reason   would have blushed at and his priuoiples abhorred   and this was   the chief cause of that distress also  which  as I observed  forced   him to exert his abilities  which he did with such success  as soon   enabled him to quit a profession that had not been his choice    and at the same time indulge the natural disposition of his heart   by practising some of the sublimest duties of it      As soon as he awoke next day  he went to visit his new family    where the happiness that glistened in every grateful eye at hia    approach made him happy  After some general chat â€”   It is my   duty  sir    said the father    to give you some account of myseU    and of the cause of my falling into that depth of misery  from which         468 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     your beneficence relieved me  that you should not think it haa been   laviahed on objects altogether unworthy of it  I am descended   from a good family  the fortune of which my father dissipated in   supporting a parliamentary interest for the ministry  the only   return he received for which  and for his voice upon all occasions    was a small pension for himself  and a pair of colours in the Guards   for me  his only son  with promises  indeed  of further provision    which were all forgotten when he died  happily for himself  before   the end of the parliament  which  as he had no prospect of being   returned again  would have left him at the mercy of creditors  whom   it was not in his power to pay  Though I was soon sensible that   my best hopes died with him  I was so infatuated to a profession   the most pleasing to youthful idleness and vanity
