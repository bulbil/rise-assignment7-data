could not fail to   inspire him with respect  He was lolling at breakfast in an elbow    chair   dressed in a morning gown of green damask  with a red cap   on his head  the cambric lining of which was edged with a rich lace   that turned up over it  and crimson velvet slippers on his feet  one   of which was extended on a cushion of the same materials  to give   him the appearance of the gout  a disorder which he looked upon   as an incontestible proof of his being sprung from a good family    while his lady poured out his tea  and between every dish read a   paragraph in the newspapers to entertain him      As soon as the herald was shown in  my master cast an eye upon   his lady  and nodding majestically towards the door  she withdrew    and left him to his business  After the usual questions about the   weather and the news  my master at length entered upon the sub    ject    I understand  s â€” s â€” sâ€” sir    said he  faltering  and almost   blushing in spite of his assurance    that you have great skill in   heraldry   and  therefore  desired to see you to consult about my   c â€” c â€” c â€” coat of arms          I do presume  sir    answered the herald  with an air of import    ance    to have some knowledge in that mysterious and sublime   science  and hope I shall not wrong the character you have received of   me in anything in which you are pleased to employ me  Hem     ahem   Pray  sir  what may be the nature of your present com    mands   I suppose you want to introduce into your own coat the         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 443     bearing of some branch of your family  which is fallen to you    There is nothing in the world easier to be done  that is by one   who  as I said before  understands the science  It is only dividing   the field properly  and taking care that the blazoning of the different   quarterings  of which all good families gain many in a long course   of descents  may not be wrongly blended  as colour upon colour    or metal upon metal  which you must know is false heraldry     though  I beg pardon  your blazoning is most likely in precious   stones  the peculiar emblems of nobility with us  But that makes no   difference  as I will convince you  if you please to let me see your arms         Sir    replied my master  still more confounded by this jargon      that is not what I want  I would have an entire nâ€” n â€”  new coat          Oh   I understand you  sir   you are the first of your family     and want to make arms for yourself  as none of your ancestors have   left you any  Why  sir  that too may be done   but it must be   with judgment and care  as I said before  for fear of interfering   with the arms of any other family  But  you may trust me for that    sir  HaU the arms you see cut such a figure about the town are of   my devising  The king may make lords and knights of whom he   pleases  but it is the herald must make them gentlemen   for what   is any man without a coat of arms   Pray  sir  what is your name     and of what profession was your father           Wh â€” wh â€” why do you ask   I suppose there cannot be any    thing material to your purpose in them           Pardon me  good sir  they are material  very material  A name    especially if it consists of many syllables  often gives an excellent   hint   for  as much as your modern wits may affect to despise the   mysterious learning of rebuses  wiser antiquity held it in higher   repute  as you must have observed from the many illustrious coats   of arms taken entirely from the name   and then knowledge of the   profession of a gentleman s father is absolutely necessary for many   reasons  There are professions  the implements of which are never   dropped  because the professions themselves are reckoned honour    able  as there also are others  nothing relating to which is ever   borne for the contrary reason  The son of a general or an admiral
