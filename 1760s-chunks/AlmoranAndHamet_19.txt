 lifting up his hand  and   beginning again to speak  HAMET remained silent        Thou knowest   said OMAR   that when my checks were yet ruddy with   youth  and my limbs were braced by vigour  that mine eye was guided to   knowledge by the lamp that is kindled at midnight  and much of what is   hidden in the innermost recesses of nature  was discovered to me  my   prayer ascended in secret to Him  with whom there is wisdom from   everlasting to everlasting  and He illuminated my darkness with His   light  I know  by such sensations as the world either feels not at all    or feels unnoticed without knowledge of their use  when the powers that   are invisible are permitted to mingle in the walks of men  and well I   know  that some being  who is more than mortal  has joined with ALMORAN   against thee  since the veil of night was last spread upon the earth        HAMET  whose blood was chilled with horror  and whose nerves were no   longer obedient to his will  after several ineffectual attempts to   speak  looked up at OMAR  and striking his hand upon his breast  cried   out  in an earnest  but faultering voice   What shall I do    Thou must   do   said OMAR   that which is RIGHT  Let not thy foot be drawn by any   allurement  or driven by any terror  from the path of virtue  While thou   art there  thou art in safety  and though the world should unite against   thee  by the united world thou canst not be hurt         But what friendly power   said HAMET   shall guard even the path of   virtue from grief and pain  from the silent shaft of disappointed love    or the sounding scourge of outrageous jealousy  These  surely  have   overtaken the foot of perseverance  and by these  though I should   persevere  may my feet be overtaken    What thou sayest   replied OMAR     is true  and it is true also  that the tempest which roots up the   forest  is driven over the mountain with unabated rage  but from the   mountain  what can it take more than the vegetable dust  which the hand   of nature has scattered upon the moss that covers it  As the dust is to   the mountain  so is all that the storms of life can take from virtue  to   the sum of good which the Omnipotent has appointed for its reward     HAMET  whose eye now expressed a kind of doubtful confidence  a hope   that was repressed by fear  remained still silent  and OMAR  perceiving   the state of his mind  proceeded to fortify it by new precepts   If   heaven   said he   should vanish like a vapour  and this firm orb of   earth should crumble into dust  the virtuous mind would stand unmoved   amidst the ruins of nature  for He  who has appointed the heavens and   the earth to fail  has said to virtue   Fear not  for thou canst neither   perish  nor be wretched   Call up thy strength  therefore  to the fight   in which thou art sure of conquest  do thou only that which is RIGHT    and leave the event to Heaven        HAMET  in this conference with OMAR  having gradually recovered his   fortitude  and the time being now near  when he was to conduct ALMEIDA   to the court of the palace  where the marriage ceremony was to be   performed  they parted with mutual benedictions  each recommending the   other to the protection of the Most High       At the appointed hour  the princes of the court being assembled  the   mufti and the imans being ready  and ALMORAN seated upon his throne    HAMET and ALMEIDA came forward  and were placed one on the right hand    and the other on the left  The mufti was then advancing  to hear and to   record the mutual promise which was to unite them  ALMORAN was   execrating the appearance of the Genius  as a delusive dream  in all the   tumults of anguish and despair  and HAMET began to hope  that the   suspicions of OMAR had been ill founded  when a stroke of thunder shook   the palace to its foundations  and a cloud rose from the ground  like a   thick smoke  between HAMET and ALMEIDA       ALMORAN  who was inspired with new confidence and hope  by that which   had struck the rest of the assembly with terror  started from his seat   with an ardent and furious look  and at the same moment  a voice
