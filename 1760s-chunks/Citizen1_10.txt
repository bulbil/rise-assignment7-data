who made professions of expiring for love  when all the world could perceive they were going to die of old age  and what is more surprising still  such batter d beaus are generally most infamously successful   A fellow of this kind employs three hours every morning in dressing his head  by which is understood only his hair   He is a professed admirer  not of any particular lady  but of the whole sex   He is to suppose every lady has caught cold every night  which gives him an opportunity of calling to see how she does the next morning   He is upon all occasions to shew himself in very great pain for the ladies  if a lady drops even a pin  he is to fly in order to present it     30He never speaks to a lady without advancing his mouth to her ear  by which he frequently addresses more senses than one   Upon proper occasions he looks excessively tender  This is performed by laying his hand upon his heart  shutting his eyes  and showing his teeth   He is excessively fond of dancing a minuet with the ladies  by which is only meant walking round the floor eight or ten times with his hat on  affecting great gravity  and sometimes looking tenderly on his partner   He never affronts any man himself  and never resents an affront from another   He has an infinite variety of small talk upon all occasions  and laughs when he has nothing more to say   Such is the killing creature who prostrates himself to the sex till he has undone them  all whose submissions are the effects of design  and who to please the ladies almost becomes himself a lady   LETTER X  To the same   I HAVE hitherto given you no account of my journey from China to Europe  of my travels through countries  where nature sports in primeval rudeness  where she pours forth her wonders in solitude  countries  from whence the rigorous   31 climate  the sweeping inundation  the drifted desart  the howling forest  and mountains of immeasurable height banish the husbandman  and spread extensive desolation  countries where the brown Tartar wanders for a precarious subsistence  with an heart that never felt pity  himself more hideous than the wilderness he makes   You will easily conceive the fatigue of crossing vast tracts of land  either desolate  or still more dangerous by its inhabitants  The retreat of men  who seem driven from society  in order to make war upon all the human race  nominally professing a subjection to Moscovy or China  but without any resemblance to the countries on which they depend   After I had crossed the great wall  the first object that presented were the remains of desolated cities  and all the magnificence of venerable ruin  There were to be seen temples of beautiful structure  statues wrought by the hand of a master  and around a country of luxuriant plenty  but not one single inhabitant to reap the bounties of nature  These were prospects that might humble the pride of kings  and repress human vanity  I ask d my guide the cause of such desolation  These countries  says he  were once the dominions of a Tartar prince  and these ruins the seat of arts  elegance  and ease  This prince waged an unsuccessful war with one of the emperors of China  he was conquered  his cities plundered  and all his subjects carried into captivity  Such are the effects of the ambition of Kings  Ten Dervises  says the Indian proverb  shall sleep in peace upon a single carpet  while two kings shall quarrel though they have kingdoms to divide them  Sure  my friend    32 the cruelty and the pride of man have made more desarts than nature ever made  she is kind  but man is ungrateful   Proceeding in my journey through this pensive scene of desolated beauty  in a few days I arrived among the Daures  a nation still dependent on China  Xaixigar is their principal city  which  compared with those of Europe  scarcely deserves the name  The governors and other officers  who are sent yearly from Pekin  abuse their authority  and often take the wives and daughters of the inhabitants to themselves  The Daures accustomed to base submission  feel no resentment at those injuries  or stifle what they feel  Custom and necessity teach even barbarians the same art of dissimulation that ambition and intrigue inspire in the breasts of the polite  Upon beholding such unlicensed stretches of power  alas  thought I  how little does our wise and good emperor know of these intolerable exactions  these provinces are too distant for complaint  and too insignificant to expect redress  The more distant the government  the honester should be the governor to whom it is entrusted  for hope of impunity is a strong inducement to violation   The religion of the Daures is more absurd than even that of the sectaries of Fohi  How would you be surprized  O sage disciple and follower of Confucius  you who believe one eternal intelligent cause of all  should you be present at the barbarous ceremonies of this infatuated people  How would you deplore the blindness and folly of mankind  His boasted reason seems only to light him astray  and brutal instinct more regularly
