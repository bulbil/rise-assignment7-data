him know I am his wife   cried she   and   whatever he is possessed of  I am an equal sharer in  let him not   therefore think that  wherever he is master  I shall cease to be   mistress        The lawyer then remonstrated to her  that though it were true  as she   said  that she had a right to partake of his fortune  yet it was still   in the power of a husband to oblige her to receive the benefit of that   right in what manner  and in what place  he should think proper  he told   her  Mr  Goodman was determined that she should quit his house  and that   all applications made by her to the contrary would be fruitless  and   exasperate him the more  and only serve to widen the unhappy breach   between them   If Mr  Goodman   said he   has no other complaint against   your ladyship  than simply his paying the penalty of the bond  and  it   may be  some other trifling debts  I cannot think he will  for any   length of time  persevere in his present inflexibility of temper   These   arguments  and some others he made use of  enforced with all the   rhetorick and art he was master of  at last convinced her  that it was   best for her to yield  with a seeming willingness  to the fate it was   not in her power to avoid  and she promised him to send Prinks directly   to hire an apartment for her  at a house near Golden Square  with the   mistress of which she had some small acquaintance       The whole time this gentleman had been with Lady Mellasin  the meat was   kept on the table  but he would not stay to eat   We have not a minute   to lose   said he to Mr  Goodman   let us go  Sir  and dispatch what we   have to do   With these words  they both went hastily out of the doors    leaving Miss Betsy in a good deal of consternation at what they were   about                CHAPTER XVI       Is a kind of olio  a mixture of many things  all of them very much to   the purpose  though less entertaining than some others          Lady Mellasin  who little expected that her husband was made so well   acquainted  or even that he had the least thought of the worst part of   her behaviour towards him  was ready enough to flatter herself  both   from her experience of his uncommon tenderness for her  and from what   his lawyer had insinuated  in order to prevail upon her to go away with   the less noise  that when this gust of passion was blown over  he would   be reconciled  and consent to her return       These imaginations made her carry it with a high hand before the   servants  and as they were packing up her things  while Mrs  Prinks was   gone to prepare a lodging for her   Your master will be glad to fetch me   home again   cried she   poor man  he has been strangely wrong headed of   late  I suppose he will be ready to hang himself when he considers what   he has done  for he may be sure I shall not very easily forgive the   affront he has put upon me        How truly amiable is an unblemished character  and how contemptible is   the reverse  Servants naturally love and respect virtue in those they   live with  and seldom or ever either flatter or conceal the vices they   do not greatly profit by  The airs Lady Mellasin gave herself on this   occasion  were so far from making them believe her innocent  or their   master blameable  that  as soon as they had gone out of her sight  they   only turned her pride  and the fall it was going to sustain  into   ridicule and grimace       Miss Betsy  however  could not see them depart in this manner  without   feeling a very deep concern  their misfortunes obliterated all the   resentment she had at any time conceived against them  and she had never   before been more angry  even with Miss Flora  for the treachery she had   been guilty of to her  than she was now grieved at the sight of her   humiliation       She was sitting alone  and full of very serious reflections on this   sudden change in the family  when her brother Thoughtless came in  she   was glad of the opportunity of sounding his inclinations as to her   living with him  and now resolved
