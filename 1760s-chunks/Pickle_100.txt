and constraint   one of the entertainers  being more intoxicated than his fellows   proposed a toast  to which Peregrine  with some warmth  excepted as an  unmannerly insult  The other maintained his proposition with indecent  heat  and the dispute beginning to grow very serious  the company  interposed  and gave judgment against their friend  who was so keenly  reproached and rebuked for his impolite behaviour  that he retired in  high dudgeon  threatening to relinquish their society  and branding them  with the appellation apostates from the common cause  Mortified at the  behaviour of their companion  those that remained were earnest in  their apologies to their guests  whom they besought to forgive his  intemperance  assuring them with great confidence that he would  upon  the recovery of his reflection  wait upon them in person  and ask  pardon for the umbrage he had given  Pickle was satisfied with their  remonstrances  resumed his good humour  and the night being pretty far  advanced resisted all their importunities with which he was entreated to  see another bottle go round  and was escorted to his own lodgings more  than half seas over  Next morning  about eight o clock  he was waked by  his valet de chambre  who told him that two of the gentlemen with whom  he had spent the evening were in the house  and desired the favour of  being admitted into his chamber  He could not conceive the meaning of  this extraordinary visit  and  ordering his man to show them enter into  his apartment  beheld the person who had affronted him enter with the  gentleman who had reprehended his rudeness   He who had given the offence  after having made an apology for  disturbing Mr  Pickle  told him that his friend there present had been  with him early that morning  and proposed the alternative of either  fighting with him immediately  or coming to beg pardon for his  unmannerly deportment over night  that though he had courage enough to  face any man in the field in a righteous cause  he was not so brutal as  to disobey the dictates of his own duty and reflection  in consequence  of which  and not out of any regard to the other s menaces  which he  despised  he had now taken the liberty of interrupting his repose  that  he might  as soon as possible  atone for the injury he had done him   which he protested was the effect of intoxication alone  and begged his  forgiveness accordingly  Our hero accepted of this acknowledgment very  graciously  thanked the other gentleman for the gallant part he had  acted in his behalf  and perceiving that his companion was a little  irritated at his officious interposition  effected a reconciliation  by  convincing him that what he had done was for the honour of the company   He then kept them to his breakfast  expressed a desire of seeing their  situation altered for the better  and the chaise being repaired  took  his leave of his entertainers  who came to wish him a good journey  and  with his attendants left Boulogne for the second time   CHAPTER XXXVII   Proceeds for the Capital  Takes up his Lodging at Bernay  where he is  overtaken by Mr  Hornbeck  whose Head he longs to fortify     6 22 15  3 45 PM   During this day s expedition  Mr  Jolter took an opportunity of  imparting to his pupil the remarks he had made upon the industry of the  French as an undeniable proof of which he bade him cast his eyes around   and observe with what care every spot of ground was cultivated  and from  the fertility of that province  which is reckoned the poorest in France   conceive the wealth and affluence of the nation in general  Peregrine   amazed as well as disgusted at this infatuation  answered that what he  ascribed to industry was the effect of mere wretchedness  the miserable  peasants being obliged to plough up every inch of ground to satisfy  their oppressive landlords  while they themselves and their cattle  looked like so many images of famine  that their extreme poverty  was evident from the face of the country  on which there was not one  inclosure to be seen  or any other object  except scanty crops of barley  and oats  which could never reward the toil of the husbandman  that  their habitations were no better than paltry huts  that in twenty miles  of extent not one gentleman s house appeared  that nothing was more  abject and forlorn than the attire of their country people  that the  equipage of their travelling chaises was infinitely inferior to that  of a dung cart in England  and that the postilion who then drove their  carriage had neither stockings to his legs  nor a shirt to his back   The governor  finding his charge so intractable resolved to leave him  in the midst of his own ignorance and prejudice  and reserve his  observations for those who would pay more deference to his opinion  and  indeed this resolution he had often made  and as often broken in the  transports of his zeal  that
