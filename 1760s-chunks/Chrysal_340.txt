husband had left the accumulated   wealth of several ages of successful industry  Such a quarry en    gaged all his attention in the pursuit  He paid his addresses to   her  though destitute of everything that could raise natural desire    with so much assiduity and warmth  that she readily received him   into her good graces  and in return for the pleasure she found in   his conversation  lavished her fortune upon him with a profusion   that even exceeded his hopes      Erom the principle on which he set out  it may be judged that he   did not neglect to improve such an opportunity of repairing his   broken fortune  and laying up a fund for a future day  out of the   overflowings of her untimely fondness  But  unbounded as her   generosity was  he was far from being content  while anythiUjg   further remained possible to be got from her  Beside the great   wealth which was directly in her power  a very large estate was by   family settlements to descend to an only daughter  whom she had       Mrs Homer  Fox met this woman on the continent whilst he was   fleeing from his creditors  and got bo much out of her that he was able   to return in a year or two  and enter Parliament as member for Hiudon   in 1735          406 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     by her husband  Aa soon  therefore  as her modest lover had got   possession of the former  his heart yearned for the latter also    with as much greediness as if his wants were only increased by his   acquisitions  But  though he was seldom long at a loss for means   to accomplish anything he had in view  as he was under no restraint   from principle in the choice of them  there was an obstacle in his   way here  which all the fertility of his genius could not surmount    This was his connection with the mother  the nature of which he   well knew would never let her consent to a scheme destructive of   itself   for he had no fear of her making opposition  from motives   of honour or virtue  to anything that dad not clash with that  as   he found none in his own conscience even to this  though contrary   to the iirst principles of nature  Since he could not  therefore    get the daughter s whole fortune by marrying her  he resolved to   exert his influence on her mother  to give her to some person of his   choosing  who should divide it with him  as a recompense for making   the match  For this purpose he pitched upon a near relation   of   his own  who readily gave in to his scheme  though possessed him    self of a fortune that placed him above the necessity of such mean    ness  The consent of the guardian mother  as he foresaw  was   easily obtained  She was happy in having such an opportunity of   proving her regard for him  as well as of removing her daughter   out of his reach  his attention to whom  while his first project was   in his head  had not escaped her jealous notice      His share of the prize  added to his other gains  made him now   a man of considerable fortune  and fired him with an ambition of   making a considerable figure in the state  To accomplish this  the   natural turn of his mind suggested it to him to marry into some   family  the interest and splendour of which might drown the ob    scurity of his own original  and assist his hopes  Nor did he appre    hend any opposition to this scheme from the same quarter that had   defeated the former  He had now gotten from her all that she had   to give  and the same principle that prompted him to be the hired   drudge of her loose desires made him find no scruple to leave her   service  when she was no longer able to pay the wages of it      Nothing is easier than to make matter for dispute  On her   expressing her resentment  with the haughtiness which she thought   the circumstances of the connection between them gave her a right   to assume  as she had on many occasions before  at something he   had done with design to provoke her  his sensibility took fire  and    in just indignation at treatment so improper for a man of honour   to submit to  he bound himself by the most dreadful imprecations   to shake off so intolerable a yoke for ever  and so flung out of her   presence      Her surprise at a behaviour so different from what he had ever   shown before suspended her resentment  and she waited with
