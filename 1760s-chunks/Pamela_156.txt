you  than you were from me  for I was just upon   resolving to defy all the censures of the world  and to make you my   wife        I will acknowledge another truth  That  had I not parted with you as I   did  but permitted you to stay till I had read your journal  reflecting    as I doubt not I shall find it  and till I had heard your bewitching   pleas in your own behalf  I feared I could not trust myself with my   own resolution  And this is the reason  I frankly own  that I have   determined not to see you  nor hear you speak  for well I know my   weakness in your favour        But I will get the better of this fond folly  Nay  I hope I have   already done it  since it was likely to cost me so dear  And I write   this to tell you  that I wish you well with all my heart  though you   have spread such mischief through my family   And yet I cannot but   say that I could wish you would not think of marrying in haste  and    particularly  that you would not have this cursed Williams   But what   is all this to me now   Only  my weakness makes me say  That as I had   already looked upon you as mine  and you have so soon got rid of your   first husband  so you will not refuse  to my memory  the decency that   every common person observes  to pay a twelvemonth s compliment  though   but a mere compliment  to my ashes        Your papers shall be faithfully returned you  and I have paid so dear   for my curiosity in the affection they have rivetted upon me for you    that you would look upon yourself amply revenged if you knew what they   have cost me        I thought of writing only a few lines  but I have run into length  I   will now try to recollect my scattered thoughts  and resume my reason    and shall find trouble enough to replace my affairs  and my own family    and to supply the chasms you have made in it  For  let me tell you    though I can forgive you  I never can my sister  nor my domestics  for   my vengeance must be wreaked somewhere        I doubt not your prudence in forbearing to expose me any more than is   necessary for your own justification  and for that I will suffer myself   to be accused by you  and will also accuse myself  if it be needful  For   I am  and will ever be   Your affectionate well wisher           This letter  when I expected some new plot  has affected me more than   any thing of that sort could have done  For here is plainly his great   value for me confessed  and his rigorous behaviour accounted for in such   a manner  as tortures me much  And all this wicked gipsy story is  as it   seems  a forgery upon us both  and has quite ruined me  For  O my dear   parents  forgive me  but I found  to my grief  before  that my heart   was too partial in his favour  but now with so much openness  so much   affection  nay  so much honour too   which was all I had before doubted    and kept me on the reserve   I am quite overcome  This was a happiness    however  I had no reason to expect  But  to be sure  I must own to   you  that I shall never be able to think of any body in the world   but him   Presumption  you will say  and so it is  But love is not a   voluntary thing  Love  did I say   But come  I hope not   At least it is   not  I hope  gone so far as to make me very uneasy  For I know not how   it came  nor when it began  but crept  crept it has  like a thief  upon   me  and before I knew what was the matter  it looked like love       I wish  since it is too late  and my lot determined  that I had not had   this letter  nor heard him take my part to that vile woman  for then I   should have blessed myself in having escaped so happily his designing   arts upon my virtue  but now my poor mind is all topsy turvied  and I   have made an escape to be more a prisoner       But I hope  since thus it
