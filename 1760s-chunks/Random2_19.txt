families in the neighbourhood  that my scruples were entirely removed  and I thought myself happy in his acquaintance —In the course of our conversation  I disclosed my condition without reserve    49 and displayed my talents to such advantage  that the old father looked upon me with admiration  and assured me  that if I stayed in France  and listened to reason  I could not fail of making my fortune  to which he would contribute all in his power     My uncle began to be jealous of the priest s insinuation  and very abruptly declared  that if ever I should renounce my religion  he would break off all connexion and correspondence with me  for it was his opinion  that no honest man would swerve from the principles in which he was bred  whether Turkish  Protestant or Roman —The father  affronted at this declaration  with great vehemence  began a long discourse  setting forth the danger of obstinacy  and shutting one s eyes against the light  He said  that ignorance would be no plea towards justification  when we had opportunities of being better informed  and that  if the minds of people had not been open to conviction  the Christian religion would not have been propagated in the world  and we should now be in a state of Pagan darkness and barbarity  He endeavoured to prove  by some texts of scripture  and many quotations from the fathers  that the Pope was the successor of St  Peter  and vicar of Jesus Christ  that the church of Rome was the true  holy  catholick church  and that the protestant faith was an impious heresy  and damnable schism  by which many milions of souls would suffer everlasting perdition —When he had finished his sermon  which I thought  he pronounced with more zeal than discretion  he addressed himself to my uncle  and desired to know his objections to what had been said  The lieutenant  whose   50 attention had been wholly engrossed by his own affairs  took the pipe out of his mouth  and replied     As for me  friend  d ye see  I have no objection to what you say  it may be either true or false  for what I know  I meddle with no body s affairs but my own  the gunner to his linstock  and the steersman to the helm  as the saying is —I trust to no creed but the compass  and do unto every man as I would be done by  so that I defy the pope  the devil  and the pretender  and hope to be saved as well as another  —  This association of persons gave great offence to the friar  who protested  in a mighty passion  that if Mr  Bowling had not been his countryman  he would have caused him to be imprisoned for his insolence —I ventured to disapprove of my uncle s rashness  and appeased the old gentleman  by assuring him  there was no offence intended by my kinsman  who by this time  sensible of his error  shook the injured party by the hand  and asked pardon for the freedom he had taken —Matters being amicably compromised  he invited us to come and see him in the afternoon at the convent to which he belonged  and took his leave for the present  when my uncle recommended it strongly to me to persevere in the religion of my forefathers  whatever advantages I might propose to my self by a change  which could not fail of disgracing myself  and dishonouring my family —I assured him no consideration should induce me to forfeit his friendship and good opinion  on that score  at which he discovered great satisfaction  and put me in mind of dinner  which we immediately bespoke  and when it was ready eat together       51 I imagined my acquaintance with the Scottish Priest  if properly managed  might turn out to my advantage  and therefore resolved to cultivate it as much as I could  With this view we visited him at his convent  according to his invitation  where he treated us with wine and sweet meats  and shewed us every thing that was remarkable in the monastery —Having been thus entertained  we took our leave  though not before I had promised to see him next day  and the time fixed for my uncle s embarking being come  I accompanied him to the harbour  and saw him on board —We parted not without tears  after we had embraced and wished one another all manner of prosperity  and he intreated me to write to him often  directing to lieutenant Thomas Bowling  at the sign of the Union flag  near the Hermitage  London   I returned to the house in which we had met  where I passed the night in a very solitary manner  reflecting on the severity of my fate  and endeavouring to project some likely scheme of life for the future  but my invention failed me  I saw nothing but unsurmountable difficulties in my way  and was ready to despair at the miserable prospect  That I might not  however  neglect any probable means  I got up in the morning  and went directly to the father  whose advice and assistance I implored —He received me very kindly  and gave me to understand  that
