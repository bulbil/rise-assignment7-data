stranger to what she wrote  Thus   every way was the poor virgin beset  And the whole will shew the base   arts of designing men to gain their wicked ends  and how much it behoves   the fair sex to stand upon their guard against artful contrivances    especially when riches and power conspire against innocence and a low   estate       A few words more will be necessary to make the sequel better understood    The intriguing gentleman thought fit  however  to keep back from her   father her three last letters  in which she mentions his concealing   himself to hear her partitioning out her clothes  his last effort to   induce her to stay a fortnight  his pretended proposal of the chaplain    and her hopes of speedily seeing them  as also her verses  and to send   himself a letter to her father  which is as follows        GOODMAN ANDREWS        You will wonder to receive a letter from me  But I think I am obliged   to let you know  that I have discovered the strange correspondence   carried on between you and your daughter  so injurious to my honour and   reputation  and which  I think  you should not have encouraged  till you   knew there were sufficient grounds for those aspersions  which she so   plentifully casts upon me  Something possibly there might be in what she   has written from time to time  but  believe me  with all her pretended   simplicity and innocence  I never knew so much romantic invention as she   is mistress of  In short  the girl s head s turned by romances  and   such idle stuff  to which she has given herself up  ever since her   kind lady s death  And she assumes airs  as if she was a mirror of   perfection  and every body had a design upon her        Don t mistake me  however  I believe her very honest  and very   virtuous  but I have found out also  that she is carrying on a sort of   correspondence  or love affair  with a young clergyman  that I hope   in time to provide for  but who  at present  is destitute of any   subsistence but my favour  And what would be the consequence  can you   think  of two young folks  who have nothing in the world to trust to of   their own to come together with a family multiplying upon them before   they have bread to eat        For my part  I have too much kindness to them both  not to endeavour to   prevent it  if I can  and for this reason I have sent her out of his way   for a little while  till I can bring them both to better consideration    and I would not  therefore  have you be surprised you don t see your   daughter so soon as you might possibly expect        Yet I do assure you  upon my honour  that she shall be safe and   inviolate  and I hope you don t doubt me  notwithstanding any airs she   may have given herself  upon my jocular pleasantry to her  and perhaps   a little innocent romping with her  so usual with young folks of the two   sexes  when they have been long acquainted  and grown up together  for   pride is not my talent        As she is a mighty letter writer  I hope she has had the duty to   apprise you of her intrigue with the young clergyman  and I know not   whether it meets with your countenance  But now she is absent for a   little while   for I know he would have followed her to your village    if she had gone home  and there  perhaps  they would have ruined   one another  by marrying   I doubt not I shall bring him to see his   interest  and that he engages not before he knows how to provide for a   wife  And when that can be done  let them come together in God s name    for me        I expect not to be answered on this head  but by your good opinion  and   the confidence you may repose in my honour  being                                          Your hearty friend to serve you         P  S  I find my man John has been the manager of the correspondence  in   which such liberties have been taken with me  I shall soon  in a manner   that becomes me  let the saucy fellow know how much I
