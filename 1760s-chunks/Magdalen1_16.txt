I conducted my explanatory interview with Miss Mildmay—You cannot  however  be more impatient to hear than I am to tell it  yet  somehow  I feel a latent kind of repugnance to enter upon the subject  as if I was sensible of having acted with a manifest impropriety—This latent uneasiness you have often called the working of honest conscience  and told me that I might be sure I had done some unjustifiable action whenever I found it busy with my tranquility  I am half afraid  Melmoth  that you are right—This Miss Mildmay hangs unaccountably upon my heart—and  was I   95 master of the universe  I would give it  either never to have seen her  or to throw an everlasting oblivion upon one cursed transaction   After breakfast on Monday morning  Mr  Mildmay withdrew to his study  and Mrs  Mildmay retired to her reading parlour  Louisa and I were left alone  and neither of us  for a full half hour  spoke a single syllable  each expecting the other would begin the conversation—My silence  as it was indeed my business to speak first  cutting the poor girl to the heart  she burst into a flood of tears  and  with some difficulty  told me  that she plainly saw how much she was lessened in my esteem  and that she was sure  after what had happened  it would be much better to think of breaking off the intended connexion than to carry it on where there was so small an expectation of happiness—To   96 this I replied  with an air of tenderness  visibly affected however  that she did the highest injustice to my love  that I beheld her with more passionate admiration than ever  and that nothing could be more idle than to teize herself with the indulgence of a fear that had so little foundation in probability  I concluded this cold compliment  with a bow upon her hand  that indicated very little or no emotion  though it contained a great deal of respect  and  turning to the window with an air of the most mortifying unconcern  observed that we could scarcely hope for any of our expected company while the weather continued so uncommonly boisterous   Louisa was a woman of too much soul to stand against the attack of a palpable indifference  however speciously glossed over with a smooth civility  and  indeed  I intended my indifference should be   97 seen pretty plainly  as I had no other method of bringing matters to an ecclarcissement with any tolerable degree of propriety—In proportion therefore  as she saw me calm and undisturbed  she very naturally took the alarm  and considered all the useless professions of my good breeding  as so many indirect declarations of my disrespect  To a fellow of your knowledge  Melmoth  I need not observe how extremely we are provoked by a polite serenity  where our hearts are deeply interested in the issue of a debate—Good breeding  where we want to excite the strongest emotions  is the most aggravating insult which we can possibly meet  because it equally disappoints our views  and denies us an opportunity of finding fault  conscious that it would effectually answer my purpose  I continued it till I had wound up Louisa to the highest pitch of passion  and madamed her with so   98 profound a degree of veneration  as gave me a speedy occasion of carrying my design into execution    Very well  Sir Robert  says she as I stood playing with a chinese figure on the chimney piece so placid and so undisturbed    You see this affair in a very easy light  but suffer me to assure you  before things are carried to the last extremity  that if you are actuated by any insolent motives of pity for me  and not influenced entirely by a regard for your own happiness  far as matters have unfortunately gone between us  I am determined to stop where we are—You may perhaps  render me wretched  but it never shall be in your power to make me contemptible     The mingled air of dignity and distress with which the beautiful girl pronounced   99 this declaration  went to my very heart—yet that damned  unhappy  facility with which she yielded to my wishes  still employ the principal share of my thoughts  I was determined to act agreeable to the resolution which I had previously made  and therefore replied    that though nothing but the honour of her hand could possibly secure my felicity  nevertheless  since she seemed so desirous to break off the treaty subsisting between us  I was ready to make any concession that might be agreeable to her inclinations  however repugnant such a concession might be to my own     The cool sarcastic humility of this reply  added greatly to her indignation  but no way got the better of her recollection —   Sir Robert  says she  it is no difficult matter to perceive the whole extent of your design—the   100 fatal testimony which I have given you of my fondness  has lessened me in your esteem  and of course rendered you disinclined to the union which was to subsist between our families  you want  by a cruel serenity  a stabbing politeless of behaviour to force me into such a refusal of your addresses  as may give a colour to your contempt  There is
