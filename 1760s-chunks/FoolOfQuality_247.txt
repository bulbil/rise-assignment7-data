this puts me in mind of what is said   by the Prince of Peace    The prince of this world cometh  and has   no part in me   And again he says to the purpose  that fathers   and sons  and mothers and daughters  shall be divided against each   other  and that  a man s enemies shall be those of his own   household       I lately met with a fragment of an epic poem that struck me   wonderfully at the time  and I recollect some of the lines that   contain  in my opinion  the most genuine  the truest picture that   ever was drawn of the state of mankind        Man comes into this passing world in weakness    And cries for help to man for feehle is he    And many are his foes  Thirst  hunger  nakedness     Diseases infinite within his frame      Without  inclemency  the wrath of seasons    Famines  pests  plagues  devouring elements    Earthquakes heneath  tne thunders rolling o er him     Age and infirmity on either hand     And death  who shakes the certain dart behind him    These  surely  one might deem  were ills sufficient      82         260 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      Man thinks not so   on his own race he turns   The force of all his talents  exquisite   To shorten the short interval  by art    Which nature left us  Fire and sword are in   His hand  and in his heart are machinations    For speeding of perdition  Half the world    Down the steep crulf of dark futurity    Push off their fellows  pause upon the brink    And then drop after       Say then  my dearest father  tell me whence comes this  Merse   than flinty  this cruel heartedness in man  Why are not all like   you  Why are they not happy in communicating happiness  If   my eyes did not daily see it in fact  as well as in history  I should   think it impossible that any one should derive pleasure from giving   pain to another  Can it be more blessed to destroy than to pre    serve  to afflict than to gladden  to wound than to heal   My heart   wrings with regret for being cast into a world where nation against   nation  family against family  and man against man  are perpetually   embattled  grudging  coveting  grasping  tearing every enjoyment    every property  and life itself  from each other      Here Harry for a while held his handkerchief to his eyes  while   his fond uncle dropped a silent tear of delight at beholding the   amiable emotion of his beloved      Take care  my Harry  rejoined Mr  Fenton   beware of the   smallest tincture of uncharitableness   You see only the worse   part  the outward shell of this world  while the kernel  the better   part  is concealed from your eyes  There are millions of worthy   people and affectionate saints upon earth   but they are as a king    dom within a kingdom  a grain within a husk it requires a kindred   heart and a curious eye to discover them  Evil in man is like evil   in the elements   earthquakes  hurricanes  thunders  and lightnings   are conspicuous  noisy  glaring   while goodness  like warmth and   moisture  is silent and unperceived  though productive of all the   beauties and benefits in nature      I once told you  my darling  that all the evil which is in you   belongs to yourself  and that all the good which is in you belongs to   your God   that you cannot in or of yourself so much as think a   good thought  or form a good wish  or oppose a single temptation   or evil motion of any kind  And what I then said of you may   equally be said of all men  and of the highest angels now in   bliss      No creature can be better than a CRAVING AND DARK DESIRE    No efforts of its own can possibly kindle the smallest portion of   light or of love  till God  by giving himself  gives his light and   love into it      Here lies the eternal difference between evil and good  between   the creature and the Creator  the spirits who are now in darkness   are there for no other reason but for their desire of a proud and   impossible independence   for their rejecting the light and love of   that God  in whom  however  they
