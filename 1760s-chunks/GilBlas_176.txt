in our attack upon your estate  You shall have the life interest  and your daughter the reversion  So good a bargain for Beatrice and myself would not allow of any wavering  I closed without delay on the conditions  The attorney kept his word most miraculously  he turned short round upon the other creditors  defeated them with the very weapons himself had furnished with their joint campaign  and secured me in the possession of my house and lands  It was probably the first time in his life that he had taken up the cause of the widow and the orphan   Thus did I become the honoured wife of an attorney  without losing my rank as the lady of the manor  But this incongruous marriage ruined me in the esteem of the gentry about Valencia  The women of quality looked upon me as a person who had lowered herself  and refused any longer to visit me  This inevitably threw me on the acquaintance of the tradespeople  a circumstance which could not do otherwise than hurt my feelings a little at first  because I had been accustomed  for the last six years  to associate only with ladies of the higher classes  But it was in vain to fret about it  and I soon found my level  I got most intimately acquainted with the wives of my husband s brethren of the quill and brief  Their characters were not a little entertaining  There was an absurdity in their manners  which tickled me to the very soul  These trumpery fine ladies held themselves up for something far above the common run  Well a day  said I to myself  every now and then  when they forgot the blue  bag  this is the way of the world  Every one fancies himself to be something vastly superior to his neighbour  I thought we actresses only did not know our places  women at the lower end of private life  as far as I see  are just as absurd in their pretensions  I should like  by way of check upon their presumption  to propose a law  that family pictures and pedigrees should be hung up in every house  Were the situation left to the choice of the owner  the deuce is in it if these legal gentry would not cram their scrivening ancestors either into the cellar or the garret   After four years passed in the holy state of wedlock  Signor Bernardo d Astuto fell sick  and went the way of all flesh  We had no family  Between my settlement and what I was worth before  I found myself a well endowed widow  I had too the reputation of being so  and on this report  a Sicilian gentleman  by name Colifichini  determined to stick in my skirts  and either ruin or marry me  The alternative was kindly left to my own choice  He was come from Palermo to see Spain  and  after having satisfied his curiosity  was waiting  as he said  at Valencia for an opportunity of taking his passage back to Sicily  The spark was not quite five and twenty  of an elegant  though diminutive person          in short  his figure absolutely haunted me  He found the means of getting to the speech of me in private  and  I will own it to you frankly  I fell distractedly in love with him from the moment of our very first interview  On his part  the little knave flounced over head and ears in admiration of my charms  I do really think  God forgive me for it  that we should have been married out of hand  if the death of the attorney  whose funeral baked meats were scarcely cold enough to have furnished forth the marriage tables  would have allowed me to contract a new engagement at so short a warning  But since I had got into the matrimonial line  it was necessary that where the church makes the feast  the devil should not send cooks  I therefore took care always to season my nuptials to the palate of the world at large   Thus did we agree to delay our coming together for a time  out of a tender regard to appearances  Colifichini  in the mean time  devoted all his attentions to me  his passion  far from languishing  seemed to become more a part of himself from day to day  The poor lad was not too flush of ready money  This struck my observation  and he was no longer at a loss for his little pocket expenses  Besides being very nearly twice his age  I recollected having laid the men under contribution in my younger days  so that I looked upon what I was then lavishing as a sort of restitution  which balanced my debtor and creditor account  and made me quits with my conscience  We waited  as patiently as our frailty would allow  for the period when widows may in decency so far surmount their grief as to try their luck again  When the happy morning rose  we presented ourselves before the altar  where we plighted our faith to each other by oaths the most solemn and binding  We then retired to my castle  where I may truly say that we lived for two years  less as husband and wife than as tender and unfettered lovers  But alas l such an
