 But what inducement has my master for taking so much pains to do   the devil s work for him   If he loves me  as  tis falsely called  must   he therefore lay traps for me  to ruin me and make me as bad as himself    I cannot imagine what good the undoing of such a poor creature as I can   procure him   To be sure  I am a very worthless body  People  indeed    say I am handsome  but if I was so  should not a gentleman prefer an   honest servant to a guilty harlot  And must he be more earnest to seduce   me  because I dread of all things to be seduced  and would rather lose   my life than my honesty       Well  these are strange things to me  I cannot account for them  for   my share  but sure nobody will say  that these fine gentlemen have any   tempter but their own wicked wills   his naughty master could run   away from me  when he apprehended his servants might discover his vile   attempts upon me in that sad closet affair  but is it not strange that   he should not be afraid of the all seeing eye  from which even that   base plotting heart of his  in its most secret motions  could not be   hid   But what avail me these sorrowful reflections  He is and will be   wicked  and designs me a victim to his lawless attempts  if the God in   whom I trust  and to whom I hourly pray  prevent it not          Tuesday and Wednesday       I have been hindered by this wicked woman s watching me so close  from   writing on Tuesday  and so I will put both these days together  I have   been a little turn with her for an airing  in the chariot  and walked   several times in the garden  but have always her at my heels       Mr  Williams came to see us  and took a walk with us once  and while her   back was just turned   encouraged by the hint he had before given me     I said  Sir  I see two tiles upon that parsley bed  might not one cover   them with mould  with a note between them  on occasion   A good hint    said he  let that sunflower by the back door of the garden be the place    I have a key to the door  for it is my nearest way to the town       So I was forced to begin  O what inventions will necessity push us upon    I hugged myself at the thought  and she coming to us  he said  as if he   was continuing a discourse we were in  No  not extraordinary pleasant    What s that  what s that  said Mrs  Jewkes   Only  said he  the town    I m saying  is not very pleasant  No  indeed  said she  it is not  it is   a poor town  to my thinking  Are there any gentry in it  said I  And so   we chatted on about the town  to deceive her  But my deceit intended no   hurt to any body       We then talked of the garden  how large and pleasant  and the like  and   sat down on the tufted slope of the fine fish pond  to see the fishes   play upon the surface of the water  and she said  I should angle if I   would       I wish  said I  you d be so kind to fetch me a rod and baits  Pretty   mistress  said she  I know better than that  I ll assure you  at this   time   I mean no harm  said I  indeed  Let me tell you  said she  I know   none who have their thoughts more about them than you  A body ought   to look to it where you are  But we ll angle a little to morrow  Mr    Williams  who is much afraid of her  turned the discourse to a general   subject  I sauntered in  and left them to talk by themselves  but he   went away to town  and she was soon after me       I had got to my pen and ink  and I said  I want some paper  Mrs  Jewkes     putting what I was about in my bosom   You know I have written two   letters  and sent them by John   O how his name  poor guilty fellow    grieves me   Well  said she  you have some left  one sheet did for those   two letters  Yes
