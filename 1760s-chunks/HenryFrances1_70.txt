Love of Life  which is  I believe  implanted in the Heart of every Creature  renders Death formidable to us while we are in perfect Health  but when the animal Spirits are weakened by Pain  when we only live to Misery  our Sentiments are wholly changed  and we wish for Death  as a Relief from Torment  Think then  if my every Thought  Hope  and Wish were not centered in you  how earnestly should I have desired a Deliverance from Pain  But  perhaps I deceive myself  perhaps  in Contradiction to what I have said  the Voice of Nature  more powerful than even that of Love  made me wish to live —perhaps  my Life is of no Consequence to you —   I will  however  endeavour to banish the cruel Reason  that would inform me  and preserve my Illusion  that I may preserve my Life     As my first Wish is to be beloved by you  my second is to be approved  let me then  my dear Harry  giving full Force to your Protestations  account for what you unjustly call Caprice  I own  I love you enough to be guilty of the very Folly you charge me with  imbittering the present Happiness  by the Fear of losing it  But it is not from this Motive  that I have mentioned our Parting  I know and feel that my Affection and Friendship for you increase daily  therefore cannot suspect that   243 your s for me are lessened  but whenever I dare venture to ask myself  what will be the End of our mutual Attachment  I tremble at the Reply my Reason makes  and almost wish we hated one another  For the present  my Regard for you renders every Pleasure in Life insipid to me  and every Accident indifferent  that has not some Relation to you  —my whole Time and Thoughts are devoted to you  and Business  or Pleasure  are alike hateful to me  For this Indifference to the Objects that surround me  I think myself amply rewarded  by the Pleasure I receive from your Letters  and wish for no other Recompence for all my Love and Tenderness  but a Continuation of your s  But tell me  my dearest Harry  what will all this end in  The little Circle of my Acquaintance speak of my Attachment to you  with seeming Pity  from a Belief  that you have none to me  The World  in general  treat me in the severest Manner  on your Account  Answer me now  my Heart s dear Harry  with Truth and Justice  for Reason prompts the Question  and Honour will not dally longer  can you indeed lay your Hand on that dear Breast  where Fanny s Heart inhabits  and tell me you have Love  Honour  and Constancy enough  to repay all her past  present  and future Sufferings  by seriously intending  whenever it is in your Power  to make her your Wife —Consider well this Point  for it is of the highest Moment to us both  and   244 on your Answer intirely depends my continuing those pleasing Ideas  which have hitherto supported me  thro  the various Scenes of Distress  I have suffered for you  or  by a proper Resolution  erasing them  and you for ever  from my Heart  Let not a false Delicacy to yourself  or an affected Tenderness for me  prevent your speaking your Sentiments with that Frankness  which  I think  I ever merited from you  and be assured  your speaking candidly  should it even acquaint me with the most unwelcome Truths  will raise you higher in my Esteem  than your attempting to amuse me with unmeaning Expressions of Regard  I do not indeed suspect  that you have hitherto said any Thing to me  which you did not think  but  as the Matter in Question is of the nicest Nature  I would guard against every Thing  which could possibly aggravate the Misfortune I am taught to apprehend   Your Reproaching me with Want of Tenderness I can readily forgive  First  as my Heart is armed so strong with Truth  that it repels the Dart  nor suffers it to wound your Image  which is lodged in its inmost Recesses —next  as my so often mentioning our Parting  without having Courage to assign the Cause  might well warrant your seeming Suspicion of my Affection  tho  I dare venture to affirm  you never yet injured me so far  as in Reality to doubt it     245Let me now  my dear and best loved Harry  conjure you by all the Love and Tenderness  you ever vowed to me  to rest assured  that the Words  which I have wrote  on the melancholy Subject of our Parting  have been so many Daggers to my Heart  and that no light Suspicion of your Love  or idle Caprice of my own  has occasioned my reducing you to an Explanation  which I would part with a Limb to avoid  for tho  I cannot  will not doubt your Love  I tremble at the Trial —No  my own Heart bears Witness to your Truth  it is filled with you  and you alone  why then should I not  in Contradiction
