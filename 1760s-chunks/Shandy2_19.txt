Dr  Slop  struck a little with my father s    frank acknowledgment —that a man in the Romish church may live as badly —but then he cannot easily die so — Tis little matter  replied my father  with an air of indifference —how a rascal dies —I mean  answer d Dr  Slop  he would be denied the benefits of the last sacraments —Pray how many have you in all  said my uncle Toby —for I always forget —Seven  answered Dr  Slop —Humph —said my uncle Toby —tho  not accented as a note of acquiescence —but as an interjection of that particular species of surprize  when a man  in looking into a drawer  finds more of a thing than he expected —Humph  replied my uncle Toby  Dr  Slop  who had an ear  understood my uncle Toby as well as if he had wrote a whole volume against the seven sacraments —Humph  replied Dr  Slop   stating my uncle Toby s argument over     again to him —Why  Sir  are there not seven cardinal virtues —Seven mortal sins —Seven golden candle sticks —Seven heavens — Tis more than I know  replied my uncle Toby —Are there are not seven wonders of the world —Seven days of the creation —Seven planets —Seven plagues —That there are  quoth my father  with a most affected gravity  But pri thee  continued he  go on with the rest of thy characters  Trim     Another is sordid  unmerciful    here Trim waved his right hand   a strait hearted  selfish wretch  incapable either of private friendship or public spirit  Take notice how he passes by the widow and orphan in their distress  and sees all the miseries incident to human life without a sigh or a prayer    And    please your Honours  cried Trim  I think this is a viler man than the other     Shall not conscience rise up and sting him on such occasions —No  thank God there is no occasion  I pay every man his own —I have no fornication to answer to my conscience —no faithless vows or promises to make up —I have debauched no man s wife or child  thank God  I am not as other men  adulterers  unjust  or even as this libertine  who stands before me     A third is crafty and designing in his nature  View his whole life — tis nothing but a cunning contexture of dark arts and unequitable subterfuges  basely to defeat the true intent of all laws —plain dealing and the safe enjoyment of our several properties —    You will see such a one working out a frame of little designs upon the ignorance and perplexities of the poor and needy man —shall raise a fortune upon the inexperience of a youth  or the unsuspecting temper of his friend  who would have trusted him with his life    When old age comes on  and repentance calls him to look back upon this black account  and state it over again with his conscience —CONSCIENCE looks into the STATUTES at LARGE —finds no express law broken by what he has done —perceives no penalty or forfeiture of goods and chattels incurred —sees no scourge waving over his head  or prison opening his gates upon him —What is there to affright his conscience —Conscience    has got safely entrenched behind the Letter of the Law  sits there invulnerable  fortified with Cases and Reports so strongly on all sides —that it is not preaching can dispossess it of its hold     Here Corporal Trim and my uncle Toby exchanged looks with each other —Aye —aye  Trim  quoth my uncle Toby  shaking his head —these are but sorry fortifications  Trim —O  very poor work  answered Trim  to what your Honour and I make of it —The character of this last man  said Dr Slop  interrupting Trim  is more detestable than all the rest —and seems to have been taken from some pettifogging Lawyer amongst you —Amongst us  a man s conscience could not possibly continue so long blinded —three times in    a year  at least  he must go to confession  Will that restore it to sight  quoth my uncle Toby —Go on  Trim  quoth my father  or Obadiah will have got back before thou hast got to the end of thy sermon — tis a very short one  replied Trim —I wish it was longer  quoth my uncle Toby  for I like it hugely —Trim went on     A fourth man shall want even this refuge —shall break through all this ceremony of slow chicane —scorns the doubtful workings of secret plots and cautious trains to bring about his purpose —See the bare faced villain  how he cheats  lies  perjures  robs  murders —Horrid —But indeed much better was not to be expected  in the present case —the poor man was in the dark —his priest had got    the keeping of his conscience —and all he would let him know of it  was  That he must believe in the Pope —go to Mass —cross himself —tell his beads —be a good Catholic  and that this  in all conscience  was enough to carry him to heaven  What —if he perjures —Why —he had a mental reservation in it —But if he is so
