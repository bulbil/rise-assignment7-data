might have crampt  or perhaps totally destroy d  It has always appear d to me  that          1 147       our understandings are fettered by systems  and our hearts corrupted by example  and that there needs no more to minds well disposed than to recover their native freedom  and think and act from themselves  Full of this idea  I have instructed you how  but never what to think  I have pointed out the road which leads to truth  but have left you to discover her abode by your own strength of mind  even on the most important of all subjects  I have said no more  than that conviction must be on the side of that religion  which teaches the purest and most benevolent morality  it most conducive to the general happiness of mankind  and gives the most sublime idea of the Deity      Convinced that the seeds of virtue are innate  I have only watched to cherish the rising shoot  and prune  but with a trembling hand  the too luxuriant branches            1 148          By virtue I would here be understood to mean  not a partial attention to any one duty of life  but that rectitude of heart  which leads us to fulfil all  as far as the frailty of human nature will permit  and which is a constant monitor of our faults  Confucius has well observed  that virtue does not consist in never erring  which is impossible  but in recovering as fast as we can from our errors        With what joy  my dearest Harry  did I early see in you that warmth of temper  which is alone productive of every extraordinary exertion of the human mind  the proper foil of genius and the virtues  that heat from which light is inseparable        I have only one fear for you  inured to a habit of profuse expence  I dread your being unable to practice that frugality  which will now be indispensable  To Lady Mary s intended settlement  I will add a          1 149       third of my estate  but even that is below your birth  and the manner of life to which you are habituated  But why do I doubt you  I know your generosity of spirit  and scorn of every species of slavery  that you will not descend to be indebted to with hold a moment the price of laborious industry  or lessen the honest profit of the trader  by a delay yet more destructive to yourself than to him      Intended to become a part of the legislative power  you are doubly bound to keep yourself from all temptation of corruption or dependence  by living within your income  the amplest estate is wretched penury  if exceeded by the expences of its possessor        Need I say more to recommend oeconomy to a spirit like yours  than that it is the fountain of liberality  and the parent of independence        You enquire after the place where I am  it is  except Belmont  the sweetest spot I          1 150       ever beheld  but in a different style  the situation is rather beautiful than magnificent  There is a mild elegance  a refined simplicity in the air all around  strongly expressive of the mind of its amiable possessor  a poetic wildness  a luxuriant glow  like that of primeval nature  adorned by the hand of the Graces      The same spirit of liberty breathes here as with you  we are all perfectly at home  our time is subject to no restraint but that which our desire of obliging each other makes a voluntary imposition        I am now alone  sitting in an arbour  attentive to the lively chant of the birds  who swell in their little throats with a morning hymn of gratitude to their Creator  whilst I listen  I think of those sweet lines of Cowley        All round the little winged choir    Pathetic tender thoughts inspire         1 151         With ease the inspiration I obey    And sing as unconcern d and as well pleas d as they        Tis yet early day  the flocks and herds are spreading over the distant meadows  and joining the universal song of praise to the beneficent Lord of nature        Rejoicing in the general joy  I adore the God who has expanded so wide the circle of happiness  and endeavour to regulate my own desires by attending to the simplicity of theirs        When I see the dumb creation  my dear Harry  pursuing steadily the purposes of their being  their own private happiness  and the good of their peculiar species  I am astonished at the folly and degeneracy of man  who acts in general
