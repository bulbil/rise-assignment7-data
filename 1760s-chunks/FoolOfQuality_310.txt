for a few   days  where it may get the fostering warmth of the sun through   one of your windows  Have you ever seen the fly they call the   dragon fly  my lord   Yes   and have admired the elegance of its   shape  the mechanism of its double wings  and the lustre of its   irradiations      This mass  my lord  of apparently insensible matter is now actually   pregnant with one of the same species  The parent  through whose   death it is to attain life  was no other  as you see  than a vile   and grovelling maggot   but the new creature that is to be born   from it will be of a quite different nature and tendency  It will   loathe the food and occupation of its foul progenitor   it will soar   sublime over carnal and earthly things   it will drink the dews of   heaven  and feed on the consummate nectar and fragrance of flowers      This  indeed  Mr  Meekly  rejoined the earl  is to make the   invisible things of God visible  even to the naked eye  by the things   that are seen      While my lord and his friend were thus deeply in discourse    Mr  John  the house steward  came in and told his master that one   waited in the hall with a letter for him      A letter   cried the earl   what can I have to say  John  to any   letter  or any of the writers thereof  But something is due to   humanity  and it shall be paid   desire him to step in          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  339     Hereupon a stranger entered  whose figure instantly caught the   eyes and attention of the earl and his companion in an astonished   captivity  The youth was dressed in a mourning frock  and his   dark brown locks  tied behind with a black riband  flowed carelessly   between his shoulders  while some of the front straying curls  as   in sport  alternately shaded and discovered a part of his lovely   countenance  He bowed  he moved attraction  and  gracefully   advancing toward my lord  he again bowed  laid a letter before him   on the table  and then silently retired backward a few steps      They viewed him they gazed on him as it had been the sudden   vision of an angel of light  Mr  Meekly was not able to utter a   word   neither had my lord the power to lay a finger on the paper   that was directed to him  till Mr  Meekly at last  giving a great   stroke on the table  cried suddenly out I would lay a thousand   pounds of it   it is he   it is he   my heart tells me he can be no   other but your Harry Clinton       Here Harry sprung forward  and  casting himself precipitately at   the feet of the earl  he clasped his knees with an eager reverence    crying My father  my honoured  my dear  my dear father  and   broke into tears      My lord  all in a tremor  attempted to raise him to his arms  and   Harry  perceiving this  rose and threw himself into the bosom of his   father  But the earl gently and fondly put him off a little  and   gazing intently on a countenance that appeared to him lovely above   all that was lovely in the circle of creation  he gathered new strength    and catching Harry to his breast  he exclaimed in a transport   Let   me die   let me die   since I have seen thy face  my son       Thus my lord  in the recent acquisition of such a son  forgot all   his losses  and cast the whole weight of his late calamities behind   him  His eyes could not be tired with seeing him  neither his ear   with hearing the sweetness of his voice   and he continued to hold    to gaze at him  to caress him  unmindful of aught else unmindful   even of his friend Meekly  who sat enraptured beside him      Will you leave me again  my child   cried out the earl   do you   intend to go from me again  my Harry  You must not you shall   not leave me not for an hour no  not for a minute   a second loss   of my son would quickly bring my grey hairs with sorrow to the   grave  Never  never  my lord  will I leave you  tenderly cried   Harry   never for a moment will I forsake you again  my
