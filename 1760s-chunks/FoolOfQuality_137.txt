As far as a guilty person loves and is reconciled to guilt  it be    comes a part of himself  and he cannot blush at it  But goodness   will blush in a closet  in a desert  in darkness  on fearing it was in   danger to have said or done any thing unbecoming or disgustful to   its own sensibilities      But again  where such a delicate virtue is accompanied by lowli    ness  there needs not any thing amiss  nor the slightest apprehension   of any thing amiss  to excite this sweet confusion in the soul and   in the countenance  Humility will blush to be found hi the pre    sence of those whom it reveres  it will blush to be thought of   either too meanly or too highly by those whose favourable opinion   it wishes to merit      This graceful effusion of a virtuous and humble heart is  as I once   hinted  the highest  and generally the most grateful compliment         126 TEE FOOL OF QUALITY      that the person can pay to the company   as it is an expression of   deference  and a comparative acknowledgment of superior merit    But it is more peculiarly amiable in your sex  Mrs  Clement   it is   that shamefacedness so grateful to God and man  and which in   scripture is called the most becoming clothing and best ornament   of a woman      However  my dear child  as this emotion is generally attended   with some little matter of pain  the present company are too much   your friends to receive any kind of pleasure from a compliment   as unmerited as it is wholly unnecessary  And  in truth  there is   but one thing that I can think of for which Mrs  Clement ought   to blush      Pray  sir  don t hold me in pain   what is it  I beseech you     It is for being a reproach almost to her whole sex      Ah  sir   cried Arabella rising  smiling and blushing  and curtsy    ing down to the ground  excuse me if I don t stay to hear myself   so abused  and  turning away  she swam and disappeared in   an instant      As soon as she was gone  Clement took out his purse of a   hundred guineas  And pray  sir  said he  what shall I do with all   this money  Oh  as for that matter  said Mr  Fenton  I know   people not half so ingenious as you are  who could quickly contrive   to get rid of a much larger sum  Lay it out in decent clothing for   yourself and your Arabella  and I will find some way to have you   reimbursed  In short  Hammel  I cannot think of parting with   you  if my fortune may serve for a sufficient cement  I will pay   you two hundred guineas yearly while you stay with me  and I will   settle on you one thousand pounds in case of my mortality  to put   you into some little station of independence      Sir  sir   cried Clement hesitatingly  you oppress me  you Hush    hush   said Mr  Fenton  putting his hand to his mouth   no compli    ments  my dear friend  It is not your thanks  but your services   that I want  and you may readily make them more than an   equivalent to such matters  I value the instilling of a single   principle of goodness or honour into the mind of my dear Harry    beyond all the wealth that the Indies can remit  Ah  Hammel    why was not that brat of yours a girl instead of a boy   She might   one day have been the wife of my precious Harry  and I might then   have had some of the breed of this wonderful Arabella      But  Hammy  continued Mr  Fenton  I would not have you    through any zeal or attachment to me  think of pushing my boy   into learning of the languages beyond his own pleasure  Neither   would I have you oppress or perplex his infant mind with the deep   or mysterious parts of our holy religion  First  be it your care to   instruct him hi morality  and let the law precede the gospel  for   such was the education that God appointed for the world  Give   him  by familiar and historical instances  an early impression of the   shortness of human life  and of the nature of the world in which he   is placed  Let him learn  from this day forward  to distinguish   between natural and imaginary wants  and that nothing is estimable    or
