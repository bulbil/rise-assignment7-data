formalities  but to secure our property  Not less than one hundred thousand families live in oppulence  elegance and ease  merely by securing our property   To embarras justice  returned I  by a multiplicity of laws  or to hazard it by a confidence in our judges  are  I grant  the opposite rocks on which legislative wisdom has ever split  in one case the client resembles that Emperor  who is said to have been suffocated with the bedcloaths  which were only designed to keep him warm  in the other  to that town which let the enemy take possession of its walls  in order to shew the world how little they depended upon aught but courage for   137 safety —But bless me  what numbers do I see here—all in black —how is it possible that half this multitude find employment  Nothing so easily conceived  returned my companion  they live by watching each other  For instance  the catchpole watches the man in debt  the attorney watches the catchpole  the counsellor watches the attorney  the solicitor the counsellor  and all find sufficient employment  I conceive you  interrupted I  they watch each other  but it is the client that pays them all for watching  it puts me in mind of a Chinese Fable  which is entituled  Five animals at a meal   A grashopper filled with dew  was merrily singing under a shade  a whangam that eats grashoppers had marked it for its prey  and was just stretching forth to devour it  a serpent that had for a long time fed only on whangams  was coiled up to fasten on the whangam  a yellow bird was just upon the wing to dart upon the serpent  a hawk had just stooped from above  to seize the yellow bird  all were intent on their prey  and unmindful of their danger  So the whangam eat the grashopper  the serpent eat the whangam  the yellow bird the serpent  and the hawk the yellow bird  when sousing from on high  a vulture gobbled up the hawk  grashopper  whangam  and all in a moment   I had scarce finished my fable  when the lawyer came to inform my friend  that his cause was put off till another term  that money was wanted to retain  and that all the world was of opinion  that the very next hearing would bring him off victorious  If so  then cries my friend  I believe   138 it will be my wisest way to continue the cause for another term  and in the mean time  my friend here and I will go and see Bedlam   Adieu   LETTER XCVI  From the same   I Lately received a visit from the little beau  who I found had assumed a new flow of spirits with a new suit of cloaths  Our discourse happened to turn upon the different treatment of the fair sex here and in Asia  with the influence of beauty in refining our manners and improving our conversation   I soon perceived he was strongly prejudiced in favour of the Asiatic method of treating the sex  and that it was impossible to persuade him  but that a man was happier who had four wives at his command  than he who had only one   It is true  cries he  your men of fashion in the East are slaves  and under some terrors of having their throats squeezed by a bow string  but what then  they can find ample consolation in a seraglio  they make indeed an indifferent figure in conversation abroad  but then they have a seraglio to console them at home  I am told they have no balls  drums  nor operas  but then they have got a seraglio  they may be deprived of wine and French cookery  but they have a seraglio  a seraglio  a seraglio  my dear creature  wipes off every inconvenience in the world     139 Besides  I am told  your Asiatic beauties are the most convenient women alive  for they have no souls  positively there is nothing in nature I should like so much as ladies without souls  soul  here  is the utter ruin of half the sex  A girl of eighteen shall have soul enough to spend an hundred pounds in the turning of a trump  Her mother shall have soul enough to ride a sweepstake match at an horse race  her maiden aunt shall have soul enough to purchase the furniture of a whole toy shop  and others shall have soul enough to behave as if they had no souls at all    With respect to the soul  interrupted I  the Asiatics are much kinder to the fair sex than you imagine  instead of one soul  Fohi the idol of China gives every woman three  the Bramines give them fifteen  and even Mahomet himself  no where excludes the sex from Paradise  Abulfeda reports  that an old woman one day importuning him to know what she ought to do in order to gain Paradise  My good Lady  answered the Prophet  old women never get there  what  never get to Paradise  returned the matron  in a fury  Never  says he  for they always grow young by the way   No  Sir  continued I  the men of Asia behave with
