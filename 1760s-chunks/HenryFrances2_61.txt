 with regard to the two recent Instances you mention  I cannot help thinking  that it is rather doing a general Injury  than a particular Charity  to support Persons in any Profession  which their Want of Capacity  Industry  or a proper Fund  renders them unfit for  These Persons  so disqualified  prevent others  who may be capable  from engaging in that Business  which they do not execute  while themselves might become useful Members of Society  in another Situation  Page  230 You may  perhaps  think this Way of arguing too severe  But  were we not to regard the general Good more than that of Individuals  the Tenderness of our Dispositions might impel us to Acts of the highest Injustice  and lead us  perhaps  to the Rescue of a Murderer  if we did not reflect on the salutary Effects  which Examples produce  in the general Community  But  while I talk with such seeming Strictness  my Heart and Pen disagree  and an inward Consciousness of the many Failings  I am incident to  strongly reminds me of the mutual Claim  which every Part of the Creation has to each other s Indulgence  and  perhaps  none has more Need of it  than my poor  faulty  helpless Self   I can very easily account for your being able to write in a more clear and distinct Manner  than you speak  For  besides the Confusion of Ideas  which you have found so just and pretty a Resemblance for  you have  probably  more Modesty than any Man  who has lived so long  and been so conversant with the World  as you have  and I am sure there are Men  who are not possessed of the thousandth Part of your Understanding or Knowledge  who could make a better Figure in a general Conversation   Distrustful Sense with modest Caution speaks   While flutt ring Nonsense in full Vollies breaks   Page  231You express much Reluctance at parting with the Child of your Fancy  and I will allow your Attachment too to be a reasonable one  But  like good Reason  let it give way to better  and remember   Your Home is every where   I am  perhaps  partial to this new Scheme  as I first mentioned it  for this  if for no other Reason  you cannot condemn me for desiring it s Success  as my utmost Wish has ever been to become  in some Shape or other  the Means of Good to thee  Let me then  my sweet Love  flatter myself  that  in this Affair  I was the Agent to thy Guardian Angel  and pointed out the Road to thy future Advantage  But I will not inforce the Subject farther  as I am sure you will do every Thing  which Sense and Prudence direct   Health  Peace  and Competence attend my Love   Frances   LETTER CCLXVIII   My Dearest FANNY   YOU have made but a more cruel Apology for your Silence last Post  than that Silence itself  You cannot imagine what Anxiety I went through  in reading your Letter  You  indeed  Page  232 I apprehended  was well and safe  from your writing  but I expected a Lapsus Linguae at every Line  The Remedy I knew to be pleasant  but the Delay of the Cure intolerably tedious  I am not so fond of this Life  as to desire to renew my Age  but I should wish most ardently to revive it in my Posterity   I must insist upon it  that   till I see you again  which shall be the sooner for your Compliance with this Request  you are in Bed  every Night  by Eleven o Clock  — as much sooner  as you please  and up at Eight  — as much earlier  as you will  and that  in every other Particular  you will live  as we should do together  alone at Belvidere  or whatever Place we may hereafter spend and enjoy our Lives together in   There is something very just in your Remarks upon my partial Humanity  But I remember to have observed somewhat to you lately  upon this Subject    Beyond the fix d and settled Rules  Of Vice and Virtue in the Schools   c    This Dispute between us puts me in mind of a parallel Difference between Swift and Pope  in their Letters to each other  but  tho  we sometimes argue on different Sides of the Question  I am satisfied we shall always agree in acting the same Way     I have not mentioned a Word to my own Family of my Correspondence with —  nor Page  233 shall I   till it is finished  I must now shorten my Letter to you  that I may have Time to lengthen one to him  the Copy of which I design to send you  and desire you will return it to me   Your s  your s  your s   LETTER CCLXIX   AND so  Sir  your chief Concern was for Bab  Indeed  Bab s Mam is affronted  tho  I may venture to assure you  she was more anxious for it  than herself  I have
