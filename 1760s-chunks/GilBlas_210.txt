though a little below par with respect to your own works in general  I know what you mean  replied he  You think I am going down hill  do not you  Out with it at once  It is your opinion that it is time for me to think of retiring  I should never have had the presumption  said I  to deliver myself with so little reserve  if it had not been your grace s express command  I act in entire obedience to your grace s orders  and I most obsequiously implore your grace not to take offence at my boldness  I were unfit to live in a Christian land  interrupted he  with stammering impatience  I were unfit to live in a Christian land if I liked you the less for such a Christian virtue as sincerity  A man who does not love sincerity sets his face against the distinguishing mark between a friend and a flatterer  I should have given you infinite credit for speaking what you thought  if you had thought anything that deserved to be spoken  I have been finely taken in by your outside shew of cleverness  without any solid foundation of sober judgment   Though completely unhorsed  and at the enemy s mercy  I wanted to make terms of decent capitulation  and to go unmolested into winter quarters  but let those who think to appease an exasperated author  and especially an author whose ear has been long attuned to the music of his own praises  take warning by my fate  Let us talk no more on the subject  my very young friend  said he  You are as yet scarcely in the rudiments of good taste  and utterly incompetent to distinguish between gold and tinsel  You are yet to lean that I never in all my life composed a finer homily than that unfortunate one which had not the honour of your approbation  The immortal part of me  by the blessing of heaven on me and my congregation  is less weighed down by human infirmity than when the flesh was stronger  We all grow wiser as we grow older  and I shall in future select the people about me with more caution  nor submit the castigation of my works but to a much abler critic than yourself  Get about your business  pursued he  giving me an angry shove by the shoulders out of his closet  go and tell my treasurer to pay you a hundred ducats  and take my priestly blessing in addition to that sum  God speed you  good Master Gil Blas  I heartily pray that you may do well in the world  There is nothing to stand in your way  but the want of a little better taste       CH  V     The course which Gil Blas took after the archbishop had given him his dismissal  His accidental meeting with the licentiate who was so deeply in his debt  and a picture of gratitude in the person of a parson   I MADE the best of my way out of the closet  cursing the caprice  or more properly the dotage of the archbishop  and more in dudgeon at his absurdity  than cast down at the loss of his good graces  For some time it was a moot point whether I should go and lay claim to my hundred ducats  but after having weighed the matter dispassionately  I was not such a fool as to quarrel with my bread and butter  There was no reason why that money  fairly earned  should deprive me of my natural right to make a joke of this ridiculous prelate  in which good deed I promised myself not to be wanting  as often as himself or his homilies were brought upon the carpet in my hearing   I went therefore and asked the treasurer for a hundred ducats  without telling a word about the literary warfare between his master and me  Afterwards I called on Melchior de la Ronda  to take a long leave of him  He was too much my friend not to sympathize with my misfortune  While I was telling my story vexation was strongly imprinted on my countenance  In spite of all his respect for the archbishop  he could not help blaming him  but  when in the fever of my resentment I threatened to be a match for the prelate  and to entertain the whole city at his expense  the prudent Melchior gave me a salutary caution  Take my advice  my dear Gil Blas  and rather pocket the affront  Men of a lower sphere in life should always be cap in hand to people of quality  whatever may be their grounds of complaint  It must be admitted  there are some very coarse specimens of greatness  which in themselves are scarcely deserving of the least respect or attention  but even such animals have their weapons of annoyance  and it is best to keep out of their way   I thanked the old valet de chambre for the good counsel he had given me  and promised to be guided by it  Pleased with my deference to his opinion  he said to me  If you go to Madrid  be sure you call upon my nephew  Joseph Navarro  He is factotum in the family of Signor Don Balthazar de Zunigna  and I can venture to recommend him as a lad in every respect worthy of your friendship
