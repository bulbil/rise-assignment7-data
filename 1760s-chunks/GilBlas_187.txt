hermitage contained  an employment which was not oppressively laborious  since the household furniture extended no further than what you remarked in the grotto  Brother Juan was not only in ill furnished lodgings  his kitchen  too  was in a very rustic plight All the store laid in consisted of some small nuts and some pieces of crusty barley bread as hard as flint  which had all the appearance of having been impregnable to the gums of the venerable man  I specify his gums  because we looked for his teeth  and found they had all dropped out  The whole arrangement of this solitary abode  every object that met our eyes  made us look upon this good anchoret as a pattern of sanctity  One thing only staggered us in our opinion  We opened a paper folded in the form of a letter  and lying upon the table  wherein he besought the person who should read the contents  to carry his rosary and sandals to the bishop of Cuença  We could not make out in what spirit this modern recluse of the desert could aim at making such a present to his bishop  It seemed to us to tread somewhat on the heels of his humility  and to savour of one who was a candidate for a niche in the calendar  Though indeed it might be  that there was nothing in it but a simple supposition  that the bishop was such another as himself  but whether his ignorance was really so extreme  I shall not pretend to decide   In talking over this subject  a very pleasant idea occurred to Lamela  Let us take up our abode  said he  in this holy retreat  The disguise of hermits will become us  Brother Juan must be laid quietly in the earth  You shall personate him  and for myself  in the character of brother Anthony  I will go and see what is to be done in the neighbouring towns and villages  Besides that we shall be too cunningly ensconced for the prying curiosity of the corregidor  since it is not to be supposed that he will think of coming hither to look for us  I have some good connections at Cuença  which may be of essential service to us  I fell in with this odd whim  not so much for the reasons given me by Ambrose  as in compliance with the humour of the thing  and as it were to play a part in a dramatic piece  We made an excavation in the ground at about thirty or forty yards from the grotto  and buried the old anchoret there without any pompous rites  after having stripped him of his wardrobe  which consisted of a single gown tied round the middle with a leathern girdle  We likewise despoiled him of his beard to make me an artificial one  and finally  after his interment  we took possession of the hermitage   The first day our table was but meanly served  the provisions of the deceased were all we had to feed on  but on the following morning  before sunrise  Lamela set off to sell the two mules at Toralva  and returned in the evening  laden with provisions and other articles which he had purchased  He brought everything necessary to metamorphose us completely  For himself he had provided a gown of coarse dark cloth  and a little red horse hair beard  so ingeniously appended to his ears  that one would have sworn it had been natural  There is not a cleverer fellow in the universe for a frolic  Brother Juan s beard was also new  modelled  and adapted to the plumpness of my face  My brown woollen cap completed the masquerade  In fact  nothing was wanting to make us pass for what we were not  Our equipage was so ludicrously out of character  that we could not look at one another without laughing  under a garb so diametrically at variance with our general complexion  With brother Juan s mantle  I caught and kept his rosary and sandals  taking the liberty of borrowing them for the time being from the bishop of Cuença   We had already been three days in the hermitage  without having been interrupted by a living soul  but on the fourth  two countrymen came into the grotto  They brought bread  cheese  and onions  for the deceased  whom they supposed to be still living  I threw myself on our miserable couch as soon as they made their appearance  and it was not difficult to impose on them  Besides that it was too dark to distinguish my features accurately  I imitated the voice of brother Juan  whose last words I had heard  to the best of my ability  They had no suspicion of the trick  though a good deal surprised at finding another hermit there  Lamela  taking advantage of their stupid wonder  said in a canting tone  My brethren  be not astonished at seeing me in this solitude  I have quitted a hermitage of my own in Arragon  to come hither and be a companion to the venerable and edifying brother Juan  who  at his advanced age  wants a yoke fellow to administer to his necessities  The rustics lavished their clumsy panegyrics on the charity of Ambrose  and congratulated themselves that they might triumph over their neighbours  and boast of two holy personages residing in their country   Lamela
