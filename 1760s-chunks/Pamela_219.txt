that can be presented her  Mr    Peters said  He was sure I should value it more than the richest diamond   in the world       I had bid Mrs  Jewkes not to dress herself  lest she should give cause   of mistrust  and she took my advice       When breakfast was over  my master said  before Abraham  Well    gentlemen  we will step into the chapel  and you must give me your   advice  as to the alterations I design  I am in the more haste  because   the survey you are going to take of it  for the alterations  will take   up a little time  and we shall have but a small space between that and   dinner  for the little tour I design to make   Pamela  you ll give us   your opinion  won t you  Yes  sir  said I  I ll come after you       So they went out  and I sat down in the chair again  and fanned myself    I am sick at heart  said I  I think  Mrs  Jewkes  Said she  Shall   I fetch you a little cordial   No  said I  I am a sad fool  I want   spirits  that s all  She took her smelling bottle  and would have given   it me  but I said  Keep it in your hand  may be I shall want it  but I   hope not       She gave me very good words  and begged me to go  And I got up  but my   knees beat so against one another  I was forced to sit down again  But    at last  I held by her arm  and passing by Abraham  I said  This ugly   slip  coming down stairs  has made me limp  though  so I must hold by   you  Mrs  Jewkes  Do you know what alterations there are to be in the   chapel  that we must all give our opinions of them       Nan  she told me  was let into the secret  and she had ordered her to   stay at the chapel door  to see that nobody came in  My dear master came   to me  at entering the chapel  and took my hand  and led me up to the   altar  Remember  my dear girl  whispered he  and be cheerful  I am    I will  sir  said I  but I hardly knew what I said  and so you may   believe  when I said to Mrs  Jewkes  Don t leave me  pray  Mrs  Jewkes    don t leave me  as if I had all confidence in her  and none where it was   most due  So she kept close to me  God forgive me  but I never was so   absent in my life  as at first  even till Mr  Williams had gone on in   the service  so far as to the awful words about requiring us  as we   should answer at the dreadful day of judgment  and then the solemn   words  and my master s whispering  Mind this  my dear  made me start    Said he  still whispering  Know you any impediment  I blushed  and said   softly  None  sir  but my great unworthiness       Then followed the sweet words  Wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded   wife  etc  and I began to take heart a little  when my dearest master   answered  audibly  to this question  I will  But I could only make a   courtesy  when they asked me  though  I am sure  my heart was readier   than my speech  and answered to every article of obey  serve  love  and   honour       Mr  Peters gave me away  and I said  after Mr  Williams  as well as   I could  as my dear master did with a much better grace  the words of   betrothment  and the ceremony of the ring passing next  I received the   dear favour at his worthy hands with a most grateful heart  and he was   pleased to say afterwards in the chariot  that when he had done saying    With this ring I thee wed  etc  I made a courtesy  and said  Thank you    sir  May be I did  for I am sure it was a most grateful part of the   service  and my heart was overwhelmed with his goodness  and the tender   grace wherewith he performed it  I was very glad  that the next part   was the prayer  and kneeling  for I trembled so  I could hardly stand    betwixt fear and joy
