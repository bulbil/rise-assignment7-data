        2 80       I walk in these sweet shades  so resembling those of Belmont  I look round as if expecting to behold her  I start at every sound  and almost fancy her lovely form in my view      Oh  Mordaunt  what transport do I find in this sweet delirium of love  How eagerly do I expect the return of evening  Could I but once again behold her  once again swear eternal passion    I have a thousand things to say            2 81         To Colonel Bellville   Tuesday Morning      I Have this moment a letter from Bell Hastings  which I send you  I wish her here  yet know not how to press it  after so rational an apology       To Lady Anne Wilmot      BEFORE I absolutely accept or refuse your Ladyship s generous invitation  allow me to account to you for my being in a place where you so little expected to find me  but which I am convinced you will acquiesce in my continuing in  when you know the motives which induced me to make choice of it            2 82          When my uncle married your Ladyship  you remember he left me in a convent at Paris  where I staid till his death  I should then have returned  but  having contracted a very great friendship for a young Lady of the first quality in England  she pressed me to continue there till her return  which was fixed for the year following  About three months before we intended to leave Paris  her brother arrived  on which occasion she left the convent  and went to spend her remaining time with an aunt who then resided in France  and who  being told I had staid the last year in complaisance to her amiable niece  insisted on my accompanying her  To spare a long narrative of common events  the brother of my friend became passionately in love with me  and I was so unhappy as to be too sensible to his tenderness  he entreated me to conceal our attachment from his sister for the present  professed the most honourable designs  told me he did not doubt of bring his father to          2 83       consent to a marriage  to which there could be no objection that was not founded in the most sordid avarice  and on which the happiness of his life depended      The time of our intended return to England drawing near  he employed  and successfully  the power he had over my heart to influence my acceptance of an invitation give me  by a friend of my mother s  to accompany her to Florence  where I promised to stay till his return from Rome        Too much in love  as he said  and I weakly believed  to support a longer absence  he came in a few months to Florence  we were then in the country with a Florentine Nobleman  whose Lady was related to my friend  to whom he was strongly recommended  and who gave him an invitation to his villa  which I need not tell you he accepted  We saw each other continually  but under a restraint  which  whilst it encreased          2 94       our mutual passion  was equally painful to both  At length he contrived to give me a letter  pressing me to see him alone in the garden at an hour he mentioned  I went  and found the most beloved of men waiting for me in a grove of oranges  He saw me at a distance  I stopped by an involuntary impulse  he ran to me  he approached me with a transport which left me no room to doubt of his affection      After an hour spent in vows of everlasting love  he pressed me to marry him privately  which I refused with an air of firmness but little suited to the state of my heart  and protested no consideration should ever induce me to give him my hand without the consent of his father        He expressed great resentment of a resolution  which  he affirmed  was inconsistent with a real passion  pretended jealousy of a young Nobleman in the house  and artfully          2 85       hinted at returning immediately to England  then  softening his voice  implored my compassion  vowed he could not live without me  and so varied his behaviour from rage to the most seducing softness  that the fear of displeasing him  who was dearer to me than life  assisted by the tender persuasive eloquence of well dissembled love  so far prevailed over the dictates of reason and strict honor  that  unable to resist his despair  I consented to a clandestine marriage  I then insisted on returning immediately to the house  to which he
