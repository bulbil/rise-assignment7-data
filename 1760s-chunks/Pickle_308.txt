was naturally clear  he enriched it with  remnants of opera tunes  to be hummed during a pause in conversation   which is generally supplied with a circulation of a pinch of snuff   By means of this cultivation she became a wonderful proficient in the  polite graces of the age  she  with great facility  comprehended the  scheme of whist  though cribbage was her favourite game  with which she  had amused herself in her vacant hours  from her first entrance into the  profession of hopping  and brag soon grew familiar to her practice and  conception   Thus prepared  she was exposed to the company of her own sex  being  first of all visited by the parson s daughter  who could not avoid  showing that civility to Mr  Hatchway s niece  after she had made her  public appearance at church  Mrs  Clover  who had a great share of  penetration  could not help entertaining some doubts about this same  relation  whose name she had never heard the uncle mention  during the  whole term of her residence at the garrison  But as the young lady was  treated in that character  she would not refuse her acquaintance  and   after having seen her at the castle  actually invited Miss Hatchway to  her house  In short  she made a progress through almost all the families  in the neighbourhood  and by dint of her quotations  which  by the bye   were not always judiciously used  she passed for a sprightly young lady   of uncommon learning and taste   Peregrine having in this manner initiated her in the beau monde of the  country  conducted her to London  where she was provided with private  lodgings and a female attendant  and put her immediately under the  tuition of his valet de chambre  who had orders to instruct her in    6 22 15  3 45 PM   dancing  and the French language  He attended her to plays and concerts  three or four times a week  and when our hero thought her sufficiently  accustomed to the sight of great company  he squired her in person to  a public assembly  and danced with her among all the gay ladies of  fashion  not but that there was still an evident air of rusticity and  awkwardness in her demeanour  which was interpreted into an agreeable  wildness of spirit  superior to the forms of common breeding  He  afterwards found means to make her acquainted with some distinguished  patterns of her own sex  by whom she was admitted into the most elegant  parties  and continued to make good her pretensions to gentility  with  great circumspection  But one evening  being at cards with a certain  lady whom she detected in the very fact of unfair conveyance  she taxed  her roundly with the fraud  and brought upon herself such a torrent of  sarcastic reproof  as overbore all her maxims of caution  and burst  open the floodgates of her own natural repartee  twanged off with the  appellation of b   and w    which she repeated with great vehemence  in  an attitude of manual defiance  to the terror of her antagonist  and  the astonishment of all present  nay  to such an unguarded pitch was she  provoked  that  starting up  she snapped her fingers  in testimony of  disdain  and  as she quitted the room  applied her hand to that part  which was the last of her that disappeared  inviting the company to kiss  it by one of its coarsest denominations   Peregrine was a little disconcerted at this oversight in her behaviour   which  by the demon of intelligence  was in a moment conveyed to all the  private companies in town  so that she was absolutely excluded from all  polite communication  and Peregrine  for the present  disgraced among  the modest part of his female acquaintance  many of whom not only  forbade him their houses  on account of the impudent insult he had  committed upon their honour  as well as understanding  in palming a  common trull upon them  as a young lady of birth and education  but  also aspersed his family  by affirming that she was actually his own  cousin german  whom he had precipitately raised from the most abject  state of humility and contempt  In revenge for this calumny  our young  gentleman explained the whole mystery of her promotion  together with  the motives that induced him to bring her into the fashionable world   and repeated among his companions the extravagant encomiums which had  been bestowed upon her by the most discerning matrons of the age   Meanwhile  the infanta herself being rebuked by her benefactor for this  instance of misbehaviour  promised faithfully to keep a stricter  guard for the future over her conduct  and applied herself with great  assiduity to the studies  in which she was assisted by the Swiss  who  gradually lost the freedom of his heart  while she was profiting by his  instruction  In other words  she made a conquest of her preceptor  who  yielding to the instigations of the flesh  chose a proper opportunity  to declare
