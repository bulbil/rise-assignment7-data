 To the same   SOME time since I sent thee  oh holy disciple of Confucius  an account of the grand abbey or mausoleum of the kings and heroes of this nation  I have since been introduced to a temple not so ancient  but far superior in beauty and magnificence  In this  which is the most considerable of the empire  there are no pompous inscriptions  no flattery paid the dead  but all is elegant and awfully simple  There are however a few rags hung round the walls  which have at a vast expence been taken from the enemy in the present war  The silk of which they are composed when new  might be valued at half a string of copper money in China  yet this wise people fitted out a fleet and an army in order to seize them  though now grown old  and scarce capable of being patched up into a handkerchief  By this conquest the English are said to have gained  and the French to have lost  much honour  Is the honour of European nations placed only in tattered silk   In this temple I was permitted to remain during the whole service  and were you not already acquainted with the religion of the English  you might  from my description  be inclined to believe   173 them as grosly idolatrous as the disciples of Lao  The idol which they seem to address  strides like a colossus over the door of the inner temple  which here  as with the Jews  is esteemed the most sacred part of the building  It s oracles are delivered in an hundred various tones  which seem to inspire the worshippers with enthusiasm and awe  an old woman who appeared to be the priestess  was employed in various attitudes  as she felt the inspiration  When it began to speak  all the people remained fixed in silent attention  nodding assent  looking approbation  appearing highly edified by those sounds  which to a stranger might seem inarticulate and unmeaning   When the idol had done speaking  and the priestess had locked up its lungs with a key  observing almost all the company leaving the temple  I concluded the service was over  and taking my hat  was going to walk away with the crowd  when I was stopt by the man in black  who assured me that the ceremony had scarcely yet begun  What  cried I  do I not see almost the whole body of the worshippers leaving the church  Would you persuade me that such numbers who profess religion and morality  would in this shameless manner quit the temple before the service was concluded  you surely mistake  not even the Kalmouks would be guilty of such an indecency  tho  all the object of their worship was but a joint stool My friend seemed to blush for his countrymen  assuring me that those whom I saw running away  were only a parcel of musical blockheads  whose passion was merely for sounds  and whose heads were as empty as a fiddle case  those who remain behind  says he  are the true Religious  they make   174 use of music to warm their hearts  and to lift them to a proper pitch of rapture  examine their behaviour  and you will confess there are some among us who practise true devotion   I now looked round me as he directed  but saw nothing of that fervent devotion  which he had promised  one of the worshippers appeared to be ogling the company through a glass  another was fervent not in addresses to heaven  but to his mistress  a third whispered  a fourth took snuff  and the priest himself  in a drowsy tone  read over the duties of the day   Bless my eyes  cried I  as I happened to look towards the door  what do I see  one of the worshippers fallen fast asleep  and actually sunk down on his cushion  is he now enjoying the benefit of a trance  or does he receive the influence of some mysterious vision  Alas  alas  replied my companion  no such thing  he has only had the misfortune of eating too hearty a dinner  and finds it impossible to keep his eyes op•n  Turning to another part of the temple  I perceived a young lady just in the same circumstances and attitude  strange  cried I  can she too have over eaten herself  O  fie  replied my friend  you now grow c•ns•rious  She grow drowsy from eating too much  that would be profanation  She only sleeps now from having sat up all night at a brag party  Turn me where I will then  says I  I can perceive no single symptom of devotion among the worshippers  except from that old woman in the corner  who sits groaning behind the long sticks of a mourning fan  she indeed seems greatly edified with what she hears  Aye  replied my friend    175I knew we should find some to catch you  I know her  that is the Deaf lady who lives in the cloysters   In short  the remissness of behaviour in almost all the worshippers  and some even of the guardians  struck me with surprize  I had been taught to believe that none were ever promoted to offices in the temple  but men remarkable for their
