I say  Sir Hargrave may be very glad  if he hear no more of this affair from the Lady s natural friends  That  however  I shall rid him of all apprehensions of that nature  for that I still consider the Lady as under my protection  with regard to any consequences that may naturally follow what happened on Hounslow heath  That I say  I shall neglect no proper call to protect her further  but that his call upon me to meet him  must be such a one as my own heart can justify  and that it is not my way to obey the insolent summons of any man breathing —And yet what is this  Mr  Bagenhall  but repeating what I wrote   Mr  B   You are warm  Sir Charles   Sir Ch   Indeed I am not  I am only earnest  As Sir Hargrave is to be shewn what passes  I say more than otherwise I should chuse to say   Mr  B   Will you name your own Time and Place  Sir Charles   Sir Ch   To do what   Mr  B   To meet Sir Hargrave   Sir Ch   To do him good—To do good to my bitterest enemy  I would meet him  Let him know  that I wrote a very long Letter  because I would discharge my mind of all that I thought necessary to say on the occasion   Mr  B   And you have no other answer to return   Sir Ch   Only this  Let Sir Hargrave engage himself in a like unworthy enterprize  and let the Lady  as this did  claim my protection  and I will endeavour   313 to give it to her  altho  Sir Hargrave were surrounded by as many men armed  as he has in his service  that is to say  if a legal redress were not at hand  If it were  I hold it not to be a point of bravery to insult magistracy  and to take upon myself to be my own judge  and  as it might happen  another man s executioner   Mr  B   This is nobly said  Sir Charles  But still Sir Hargrave had not injured you  he says  And as I had heard you were a man of an excellent character  and as I know that Sir Hargrave is a man of courage  I took it into my head  for the prevention of mischief  to make a proposal in writing to the Lady  whom Sir Hargrave loves as his own soul  and if she had come into it—  Sir Ch   A strange proposal  Mr  Bagenhall  Could you expect any thing from it   Mr  B   Why not  Sir Charles  She is disengaged  it seems  I presume  Sir  you do not intend to make court to her yourself   Sir Ch   We are insensibly got into a parley  upon a subject that will not bear it  Mr  Bagenhall  Tell Sir Hargrave—or  write it down from my lips  Sir   speaking to the writer  That I wish him to take time to enquire after my character  and after my motives in refusing to meet him  on the terms he expects me to see him  Tell him  That I have  before now  shewn an insolent man  that I may be provoked  But that  when I have been so  I have had the happiness to chastise such a one without murdering him  and without giving any advantage over my own life  to his single arm   Mr  B   This is great talking  Sir Charles   Sir Ch   It is  Mr  Bagenhall  And I should be sorry to have been put upon it  were I not in hope  that it may lead Sir Hargrave to such enquiries as may be for his service  as much as for mine   Mr  B   I wish  that two such spirits were better acquainted with each other  or that Sir Hargrave had not   314 suffered so much as he has done  both in person and mind   Sir Ch   What does all this tend to  Mr  Bagenhall  I look upon you as a gentleman  and the more  for having said  You were sollicitous to prevent further mischief  or I should not have said so much to so little purpose  And once more  I must refer to my Letter   Mr  B   I own I admire you for your spirit  Sir  But it is amazing to me  that a man of your spirit can refuse to a gentleman the satisfaction which is demanded of him   Sir Ch   It is owing to my having some spirit  that I can  fearless of consequences  refuse what you call satisfaction to Sir Hargrave  and yet be fearless of insult upon my refusal  I consider myself  as a mortal man  I can die but once  Once I must die  And if the cause be such as will justify me to my own heart  I  for my own sake  care not  whether my life be demanded of me
