that Lady Olivia is grieved on the remembrance of it  and arraigns herself  and her wicked passion  and the more  for his noble forgiveness of her on the spot  and recommending her afterwards to the civilities of his sisters  and their Lords  But I hate her  for all that   Poor unhappy Olivia  said I  But what  my Emily  are we women  who should be the meekest and tenderest of the whole animal creation  when we give way to passion  But if she is so penitent  let not the shocking attempt be known to his sisters  or their Lords  I may take the liberty of mentioning it  in strict confidence  Observe that  Lucy  to those from whom I keep not any secret  But let it not be divulged to any of the relations of Sir Charles  Their detestation of her  which must follow  would not be concealed  and the unhappy creature  made desperate  might—Who knows what she might do   The dear girl ran on upon what might have been the consequence  and what a loss the world would have had  if the horrid fact had been perpetrated  Lady Maffci told her  however  that had not her heart relented  she might have done him mischief  for he was too rash in approaching her  She fell down on her knees to him  as soon as he had wrested the poniard from her  I forgive  and pity you  madam  said he  with an air that had  as Olivia and he• aunt have recollected since  both majesty and company a   178 in it  But he would withdraw  Yet  at her request  sent in Lady L  to her  and  going into his Study  told not even Dr  Bartlett of it  tho  he went to him there immediately   From the consciousness of this violence  perhaps  the Lady was more temperate afterwards  even to the very time of his departure   LORD bless me  What shall I do  Lady D  has sent a card to let me know  that she will wait upon Mrs  Reeves and me to morrow to breakfast  She comes  no doubt  to tell me  that Sir Charles having no thoughts of Harriet Byron  Lord D  may have hopes of succeeding with her  And perhaps her Ladyship will plead Sir Charles s recommendation and interest in Lord D s favour  But should this plea be made  good Heaven give me patience  I am afraid I shall be uncivil to this excellent woman   LETTER XXV  Miss BYRON  In Continuatin   Monday  April 17   THE Countess is just gone   Mr  Reeves was engaged before to breakfast with Lady Betty Williams  and we were only Mrs  Reeves  Lady D  and I   My heart aked at her entrance  and every moment still more  as we were at breakfast  Her looks  I thought  had such particular kindness and meaning in them  as seemed to express     You have no hopes  Miss Byron  any where else  and I will have you to be mine      But my suspence was over the moment the tea table was removed  I see your confusion  my dear  said the Countess  Mrs  Reeves  you must not leave us   and I have sat in pain for you  as I saw it increase    179 By this I know that Sir Charles Grandison has been as good as his word  Indeed I doubted not but he would  I don t wonder  my dear  that you love him  He is the finest man in his manners  as well as person  that I ever saw  A woman of virtue and honour cannot but love him  But I need not praise him to you  nor to you  neither  Mrs  Reeves  I see that   Now you must know  proceeded she  that there is an alliance proposed for my son  of which I think very well  but still should have thought better  had I never seen you  my dear  I have talked to my Lord about it  You know I am very desirous to have him married  His answer was  I never can think of any proposal of this nature  while I have any hope that I can make myself acceptable to Miss Byron   What think you  my Lord  said I  if I should directly apply to Sir Charles Grandison  to know his intentions  and whether he has any hopes of obtaining her favour  He is said to be the most unreserved of men  He knows our characters to be as unexceptionable as his own  and that our alliance cannot be thought a discredit to the first family in the kingdom  It is a free question  I own  as I am unacquainted with him by person  But he is such a man  that methinks I can take pleasure in addressing myself to him on any subject   My Lord smiled at the freedom of my motion  but not disapproving it  I directly went to Sir Charles  and  after due compliments  told him my business   The Countess stopt
