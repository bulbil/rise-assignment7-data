eyes  left me to make an answer  Mrs Gerrarde  said I  I declare to you solemnly that there is no deception in any thing which you see  nor any foul play meant to you  This young man  whom I now present to you for your husband  is well born  and has many genteel relations in this country  he has it in his power  to my certain knowlege  to make good the settlement he proposes for you  which I will take care to see properly secured  That part of it which is your own property  you have now in your possession  the other half I know is his  He was brought up to a creditable business  which he intends to follow  I know him to be good natured  and of an obliging temper  He lived with me some time  and accompanied me in my travels  I suppose his having been my gentleman  which station he did not accept through necessity  will not be a material objection  and I smiled and affected to look very proud   and I only mention it to convince you that I have no design of deceiving you  or concealing any part of his character   Pivet coloured  for I stole a side glance at him  and looked sheepish  He began an aukward compliment with a bow  and ‘I hope     madam’—but I relieved him  and speaking to Mrs Gerrarde  You know all now  madam  that can be known  therefore  if you are disposed to keep your word  let us put an end to this business to day  To day  Sir  Yes  to day  madam  What occasion is there for farther delay   Pivet now plucked up his courage  and begged  since she had consented  that she would not defer his happiness  I told her  between mirth and chiding  that I was in haste to get rid of my charge  and was therefore determined to make her over to Mr Pivet that evening  and telling her I would give orders about the ceremony  left the lovers to make out for themselves a scheme of conjugal felicity  Pivet pleaded his own cause so effectually  that  in the evening  I had the satisfaction of bestowing  with my own hand  that inestimable treasure of virtue and meekness  Mrs Gerrarde  on my faithful Squire  Monsieur Pivet  to the no small joy of the latter  and I believe  if the truth were known  to the no great mortification of the former  Mrs Rachael and myself were the only witnesses of this illustrious union   When the ceremony was over  I approached  according to custom  to congratulate and salute the bride  but she turned her saucy cheek to me  and affected the whole night vast dignity of behaviour  yet it was so foreign to her nature  that it appeared ridiculous  however it was better than ranting   I invited them both to sup with me  and treated Pivet with a familiar civility that seemed to please him highly  as it did him credit in the presence of his lady   After supper  Pivet entreated me to complete the friendly and generous offices I had already done him  by undertaking the settlement of all money matters for him  As he knew I intended to go to Paris  he begged I would receive for him the sum he had in the hands of the banker  which  he said  if I would remit to him  it would enable him to enter upon his business immediately  At the same time he  with no ill grace  presented me my bond again  assuring me he relied entirely upon my honour for the execution of my promise to him  farther requesting that I would put that  together with Mrs Gerrarde’s money  if she approved of it  into such hands as I should judge most proper for her advantage   I was pleased at the openness of his proceedings  and promised to do every thing for their mutual satisfaction  but insisted on his keeping the bond  or lodging it in some proper hand  till I could    redeem it  by paying the money  which I should take care should be speedily done  I told him  I thought the sooner he set out for his own province the better  He said  he should be ready the next day  if Mrs Gerrarde  for he did not yet presume to call her by his name  did not object to it  He appealed to her with his looks   She had scarce condescended to open her lips before  but now answered  You may be sure  Sir  I shall not think it too soon to get out of a prison   He asked her if she chose to take her maid Rachael along with her   Certainly  she said  I should not be fond of having a servant about me  by whom I should not be understood   Rachael was now called in  and the thing proposed to her  She seemed rather inclined to return to England  but I told her  she could not  in gratitude  desert her lady in a strange country  and that if she had a mind to make me her friend  which she should
