anguish than that of   this unfortunate young lady  as she was yet ignorant of what steps her   brothers intended to take in this affair  and feared they might be such   as would render what had happened to her publick to the world  she fell   into reflections that almost turned her brain  she represented to   herself all the sarcasms  all the comments  that she imagined  and   probably would have been made on her behaviour  her danger  and her   delivery  all these thoughts were insupportable to her  she resolved to   hide herself for ever from the town  and pass her future life in   obscurity  so direful to her were the apprehensions of becoming the   object of derision  that  rather than endure it  she would suffer any   thing       In the present despondency of her humour  she would certainly have fled   the town  and gone directly down to L    e  if she had not known that   Sir Ralph and Lady Trusty were expected here in a very short time  and   she was so young when she left that country  that she could not think of   any family to whom it was proper for her to go  without some previous   preparations       All her pride  her gaiety  her vanity of attracting admiration  in fine    all that had composed her former character  seemed now to be lost and   swallowed up in the sense of that bitter shame and contempt in which she   imagined herself involved  and she wished for nothing but to be unseen    unregarded  and utterly forgotten  by all that had ever known her  being   almost ready to cry out  with Dido             Nor art  nor nature s hand  can ease my grief        Nothing but death  the wretch s last relief        Then farewel  youth  and all the joys that dwell       With youth and life  and life itself  farewel        The despair of that unhappy queen  so elegantly described by the poet    could not far transcend what poor Miss Betsy sustained during this whole   cruel night  nor did the day afford her any more tranquillity  on the   contrary  she hated the light  the sight even of her own servants was   irksome to her  she ordered  that whoever came to visit her  except her   brothers  should be denied admittance  complained of a violent pain in   her head  would not be prevailed upon to take the least refreshment  but   kept herself upon the bed  indulging all the horrors of despair and   grief       In the afternoon Mr  Francis Thoughtless came  seemed a little surprized   to find his brother was not there  and told Miss Betsy  that  having   been called different ways  they had appointed to meet at her lodgings    in order to have some serious discourse with her concerning her future   settlement  to which she replied  that her late fright hung so heavy on   her spirits  that she was in little condition at present to resolve on   any thing       She spoke this with so dejected an air  that Mr  Francis  who truly   loved her  in spite of all the resentment he had for the errors of her   conduct  could not forbear saying a great many tender things to her  but   nothing afforded her so much consolation as the account he gave her    that no prosecution would be commenced against the sham Sir Frederick   Fineer   The villain   said he   is run away from his lodgings  but    questionless  might easily be found out  and brought to justice  but the   misfortune is  that in cases of this nature  the offended must suffer as   well as the offender  to punish him  must expose you  You see    therefore  to what your inadvertency has reduced you  injured to the   most shocking degree  yet denied the satisfaction of revenge        Miss Betsy only answering with her tears   I speak not this to upbraid   you   resumed he   and would be far from adding to the affliction you   are in  on the contrary  I would have you be chearful  and rejoice more   in the escape you have had  than bewail the danger you have passed   through  but then  my dear sister  I would wish you also to put yourself   into a condition which may defend you from attempts of this vile   nature        He was going on with something farther  when the elder Mr  Thoughtless   came in   I have been detained
