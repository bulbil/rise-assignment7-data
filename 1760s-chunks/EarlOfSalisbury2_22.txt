such  answers as confirmed his joy  He now secretly condemned his own rash  suspicions of the Countess  his love was redoubled  he was impatient to  receive her in his arms  and all the lively impressions of delight and  satisfaction which he felt were communicated to his friends  Chauvigny  embraced him in joyful congratulation  Randolph forgot his suspicions   and wore a face of serenity and pleasure  A generous repast was  prepared  and the board was graced with the most enlivened social  festivity     The false host knew full well the dreadful purpose now to be executed   and dared not oppose  though he shuddered at the thought of it  To  Reginhald he resigned the absolute command of his domestics  The wicked  Monk was officiously attentive to oblige Lord Salisbury  eager to  promote the joy of the table  but less intent on sharing in this joy   than in providing for the guests  He had now mixed the fatal draught   and saw the poisoned bowl in the hand of an attendant  ready to be  delivered to Lord William  He stood unnoticed in a distant part of the  hall  his heart panting  his limbs trembling  and his haggard eyes fixed  upon the Earl  He saw him  receive the bowl  he retired towards the entrance of the hall  he heard  him salute his host and his associates  he turned  and saw him raise the  poison towards his head â€”In that instant he rushed impetuously out   regardless of those who were entering with equal haste  mounted his  horse  which stood prepared by his appointment  and in an extravagance  of horrid and malignant joy  fled to Lord Raymond with the important  news that the Earl of Salisbury was no more     The joy of Raymond was extravagant  With eyes all on fire  and accents  faltering with impatience and emotion  he demanded the particulars of  this surprising intelligence  and the shameless and abandoned wickedness  of Reginhald scrupled not to declare the whole of his adventures since  his late departure from the castle  He was heard with eagerness and  anxiety  At the mention of poison Raymond trembled  the blood forsook  his cheeks  and his brow bespoke horror and consternation  but Grey  laboured to quiet his disordered spirit  by observing  that he had  taken no part in the deed  that it was past and irrevocable  that now   he had but to consider how to approve this event to his own advantage   to the interests of his love and fortune  The wretch who hath once  deviated from the paths of goodness  is easily reconciled to the horrors  of his progress in iniquity  The thoughts of this Lord were soon turned  to the flattering prospects of happiness which were presented to his  imagination  his first emotions of joy and triumph returned  he  commended the zeal and daring spirit of Reginhald  and Grey joined in  the applause  although his wicked heart secretly repined at the share  which his brother might now boast  in advancing the designs of Lord  Raymond  and envied the vast rewards which his services might justly  claim     Raymond was now sully persuaded that all his wishes were speedily to be  crowned with success  that future difficulties would gradually vanish   In his present state of exultation he forgot the obstinacy with  which the Countess had hitherto opposed his desires  and flattered  himself with the hopes that a little time  together with a full and  clear assurance of the death of Salisbury  would prevail on her to  listen more favourably to his suit  For a while he resolved to suspend  his sollicitations  but  as the prospect of success served to inflame  his passion  he obstinately adhered to his resolution of possessing the  proud Lady  and even of recurring once more to violence  if violence  should be necessary  With an affected lenity and generosity he ordered  the three followers of William to be dismissed  when he had first  severely reproved them  for presuming to disturb the minds of his  friends by false intelligence  They returned towards the house of  Randolph  still wondering at the delay of their Lord  and impatient to  acquaint him with those important tidings  which the unhappy Oswald had  found means of giving them in their confinement  notwithstanding the  vigilance of their guards     Nor did these late extraordinary events  which had engaged all the  attention of Raymond and his creatures  fail to excite the wonder and  expectation of the Countess  They had suspended her persecution  and  now gave her leisure to indulge her hopes of relief and deliverance   Such hopes she had not yet resigned  though tormented by delay and  painful disappointment  Some fears indeed sometimes arose  to cloud the  pleasing thoughts she was studious to entertain  yet when she reflected  how abruptly Raymond had retreated from his wicked purpose of forcibly  possessing himself of her bed  under the pretence of a nuptial  ceremony  when she considered the appearances of commotion and disorder  which were evidently discoverable in the castle  she seemed to have good  reasons to persuade
