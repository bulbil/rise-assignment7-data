from habits the poor beasts took very kindly of their own accord  Their masters kept tight hold of me  and let the trap down after them  Thus was the worthy nephew of my uncle Perez caught  just for all the world as you would catch a rat       CH  IV     Description of the subterraneous dwelling and its contents   I NOW knew into what company I had fallen  and I leave it to any one to judge whether the discovery must not have rid me of my former fear  A dread more mighty and more just now seized my faculties  Money and life  all given up for lost  With the air of a victim on his passage to the altar did I walk  more dead than alive  between my two conductors  who finding that I trembled  frightened me so much the more by telling me not to be afraid  When we had gone two hundred paces  winding down a declivity all the way  we got into a stable lighted by two large iron lamps suspended from the vault above  There was a good store of straw  and several casks of hay and corn with room enough for twenty horses  but at that time there were only the two which came with us  An old Negro  who seemed for his years in pretty good case  was tying them to the rack where they were to feed   We went out of the stable  By the melancholy light of some other lamps  which only served to dress up horror in its native colours  we arrived at a kitchen where an old harridan was broiling some steaks on the coals  and getting supper ready  The kitchen furniture was better than might be expected  and the pantry provided in a very plentiful manner  The lady of the larder s picture is worth drawing  Considerably on the wrong side of sixty     In her youth her hair had been of a fiery red  though she would have called it auburn  Time had indeed given it the fairer tint of grey  but a lock of more youthful hue  interspersed at intervals  produced all the variegated effect of the admired autumnal shades  To say nothing of an olive complexion  she had an enormous chin turning up  an immense nose turning down  with a mouth in the middle  modestly retiring inwards  to make room for its encroaching neighbours  Red eyes are no beauty in any animal but a ferret     hers were purple   Here  dame Leonard  said one of the horsemen as he presented me to this angelic imp of darkness  we have brought you a young lad  Then looking round  and observing me to be miserably pale  Pluck up your spirits  my friend  you shall come to no harm  We want a scullion  and have met with you  You are a lucky dog  We had a boy who died about a fortnight ago  you shall succeed to the preferment  He was rather too delicate for his place  You seem a good stout fellow  and may live a week or two longer  We find you in bed and board  coal and candle  but as for day light  you will never see that again  Your leisure hours will pass off very agreeably with Leonard  who is really a very good creature  and tolerably tender hearted  you will have all your little comforts about you  I flatter myself you have not got among beggars  At this moment the thief seized a flambeau  and as I feared   with zeal to destroy   for he ordered me to follow him   He took me into a cellar  where I saw a great number of bottles and earthen pots full of excellent wine  He then made me cross several rooms  In some were pieces of cloth piled up  in others  stuffs and silks  As we passed through I could not help casting a sheep s eye at the gold and silver plate peeping out of the different cupboards  After that  I followed him into a great hall illuminated by three copper lustres  and serving as a gallery between the other rooms  Here he put fresh questions to me  asking my name     why I left Oviedo     and when I had satisfied his curiosity  Well  Gil Blas  said he  since your only motive for quitting your native place was to get into something snug and eligible  to be sure you must have been born to good luck  or you would not have fallen into our hands  I tell you once for all  you will live here on the fat of the land  and may souse over head and ears in ready money  Besides  you are in a place of perfect safety  The officers of the holy brotherhood might pass through the forest a hundred times without discovering our subterraneous abode  The entrance is only known to myself and my comrades  You may perhaps ask how it came to be contrived  without being perceived by the inhabitants in the neighbourhood  But you are to understand  my friend  that it was made long ago  and is no work of ours  After the Moors had made themselves masters of Granada  of Arragon  and nearly
