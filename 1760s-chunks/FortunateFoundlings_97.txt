or the   peace of him whom you have ever found a father   in his care and affection  and whom you will   now find so more than you can possibly expect       DORILAUS           Impossible is it to conceive  without being in the very circumstances   Horatio was  what a strange variety of mingled passions agitated his   breast on having to read  and considered these letters   to find such   unhoped condescension from the baron de Palfoy and that Dorilaus was   still living  and had the same  if not more tender inclinations for him   than ever  the latter of which he had long since ceased to hope  was   sufficient to have overwhelmed even the most phlegmatic person with an   excess of joy   but then the dark expressions in both these letters put   his brain on the rack   The baron had seemed to refer to an explanation   of what he darkly hinted at in the letter of Dorilaus  but that he found   rather more obsolete  he could imagine nothing farther than that   Dorilaus having resolved to make him his heir  as he remembered some   people said before he left England  on the knowledge of that   intelligence the baron de Palfoy had consented to his marriage with   mademoiselle Charlotta  and this  her being permitted to write to him   confirmed   This indeed was the supreme aim of his desires  and this it   was that made him quit St  Germains  in hope of raising himself to a   condition which might enable her to own her affection to him without a   blush  but transporting as this idea was  it was mingled with disquiet    to reflect on the terms which both the Baron and Dorilaus seemed to   insist on for the accomplishment of his wishes  tho  he impatiently   longed to see Dorilaus after so long an absence   Tho  in the possession   of Charlotta all his hopes were centered  yet to leave a prince who had   so highly favoured him  and under whose banners he had gained so much   consideration  was a piece of ingratitude  which it was worse than death   for him to be guilty of   No  said he  it would be to render me unworthy   of all the blessings they make me hope  should I purchase them on such   conditions   How can they demand them of me   The Baron  Charlotta  and   Dorilaus  have all of them the highest notions of honour  generosity and   gratitude  and can they approve that in me  which I am certain they   would not be guilty of themselves   Sure it is but to try me  they seem   to exact what they are sensible I cannot yield to  without the breach of   every thing that can entitle me to esteem or love       Thus did he argue within himself for one moment  the next  other   reasons  directly opposite to these  presented themselves   Dorilaus    cried he  demands all my obedience   all my gratitude   without   protection I had been an outcast in the world   Whatever honours    whatever happiness I enjoy  is it not to him I owe them  Can I refuse   then to comply with commands  which  he says  are necessary to his   peace   Besides  was it not Charlotta that inspired this ardor in me for   great actions  Was not the possession of that charming maid  the sole   end I proposed to myself in all I have undertaken  and shall I  by   refusing her request  madly run the risque of losing her for ever   Does   not she wish  her father persuade  and Dorilaus enjoin me to   return   Does not love  friendship  duty call me to partake the joys   that each affords   And shall I refuse the tender invitation   No  the   world cannot condemn me for following motives such as these  and even   the royal Charles himself is too generous not to acquit me of   ingratitude or cowardice       It must indeed be confessed he had potent inducements for his return to   Paris  to combat against those of continuing in the king of Sweden s   service  and both by turns appeared so prevalent  that it is uncertain   which would have got the better  had not an accident happened  which   unhappily determined him in favour of the latter       Colonel Poniatosky  who had attended Stanislaus into Poland  now the   disturbances of that kingdom were quieted  on hearing the king of Sweden   was on some new expedition  obtained leave of Stanislaus to return to   the camp  and implored his majesty s permission to be one of those who   should partake the glorious toils he was now re
