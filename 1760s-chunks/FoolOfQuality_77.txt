of our hero s flight was now  in a great measure    unravelled   but no one could form any rational conjecture touch    ing the motives of the old gentleman s procedure in the case     and all were staggered at his leaving such a mass of wealth behind   him      As the falling on of a dark night rendered all pursuit  for that   time  impracticable  my lord ordered the servants to bed  that they   might rise before day  and then to take every horse he had    coach cattle and all  and to muster and mount the young men   of the village  and to pursue after the fugitives by different roads    according to the best likelihood or intelligence they might receive      In fhis hopeful prospect  the house was again in some measure   composed   all  except poor nurse  who would not be comforted      2         52 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      neither could be prevailed upon to enter in at the doors   but   all night on the cold stairs  or rambling through the raw air    continued clapping and wringing her hands  and bewailing the irre    parable loss of her Harry      On the following day  my lord ordered a minute inventory to   be taken of all the furniture in the forsaken mansion house   and   further appointed Harry s foster father  with his family  to enter   into possession  and to take care of the eifects  till such time as   the proprietor should renew his claim      After three tedious days  and as many expecting nights  the   posse that went in quest of our runaways returned  all drooping   and dejected  most of them slowly leading their overspent horses    and universally bespattered or covered with mire  without any   equivalent of comfortable tidings to balance the weight of their   languor and fatigue      The happiness or wretchedness of human life  as it should seem    does not so much depend on the loss or acquisition of real ad    vantage  as on the fluctuating opinions and imaginations of men    The absence of this infant  who  but a few months before  had no   manner of interest in the views  affections  or solicitudes of this   noble family  appeared now as the loss of all their honours and   fortunes  a general face of mourning seemed to darken every   apartment   and my lord and lady no more paid visits  nor received   public company  They were  however  inventive in many contri    vances for amusing and consoling their darling Dicky  but even   this was to little purpose  for he was often found silently languish    ing in corners  or crying 0  where s my brother Harry  my own   sweet brother Harry   shall I never see my own brother Harry   any more       My lord had already despatched a multitude of circular letters   to all his acquaintances  with other notices  throughout the king    dom  containing offers of ample rewards for the recovery of his   child  But finding all ineffectual  he caused advertisements to   the same purpose to be repeatedly inserted in all the public   papers   as the same  no doubt  are still extant  and may be found   in the musty chronicles of those days      Within a few weeks after the publishing of these advertisements    my lord received a letter respecting his son Harry  that afforded   great consolation to him and his lady   insomuch that  with the   help of the lenient hand of time  in less than the space of twelve   months this noble family were restored to their former cheerfulness   and tranquillity      But to return to the situation in which we left our hero   the   coach drove on at a round rate  and the children continued in high   glee  and thought this kind of conveyance the finest sport imaginable      When they entered a space on the first common  the coachman   looked about to take care that no one was in sight   and  turning   to the right hand  he held gently on till he came to another great   road  on which he drove at his former rate  This he did again   at the next common  and coming to another road that led also to   London  and night now approaching  he put up at the first great inn   he came to          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  53     Harry s patron had the precaution to keep his great coat muffled   about his face  so that no one could observe his beard
