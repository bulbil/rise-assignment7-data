for a peru•al of your Letters to Dr  Bartlett for the same number of weeks past  Letter for Letter  if we could prevail on Miss Byron to consent to the proposal   Would Miss Byron consent  upon that condition   What say you  Miss Byron  said my Lord   I answered  that I could not presume to think  that the little chit chat  which I wrote to please my partial friends in the country  could appear tolerable in the eye of Sir Charles Grandison   They all answered with high encomiums on my pen  and Sir Charles  in the most respectful manner    103 insisting upon not being denied to see what Lord L  had perused  and Miss Grandison having said that I had  to oblige them  been favoured with the return of my Letters from the country  I thought it would look like a too meaning particularity  if I refused to oblige him  in the light  tho  not a very agreeable one  I own to you  Lucy  of another brother  I told him  that I would shew him very willingly  and without condition  all the Letters I had written  of the narrative kind  from my first coming to London  down to the dreadful masquerade affair  and even Sir Hargrave s barbarous treatment of me  down to the deliverance he had so generously given me   How did he extol me  for what he called my noble frankness of heart  In that grace  he said  I excelled all the women he had ever conversed with  He assured me  that he would not wish to see a line that I was not willing he should see  and that if he came to a word or passage that he could suppose would be of that nature  it should have no place in his memory   Miss Grandison called out—But the condition  Sir Charles—  Is only this  replied I  I am sure of your candor  Sir   that you will correct me  where I am wrong  in any of my notions or sentiments  I have been very pert and forward in some of my Letters  particularly  in a dispute that was carried on in relation to Learning and Languages  If I could not  for improvement  sake  more heartily bespeak your correction than your approbation  I should be afraid of your eye there   Excellent Miss Byron  Beauty shall not bribe me on your side  if I think you wrong in any point that you submit to my judgment  And if I am Beauty proof  I am sure nothing on earth can biass me   Miss Grandison said  she would number the Letters according to their dates  and then would give them to me  that I might make such conditions with   104 her brother on the loan  as every one might be the b•tter for   BREAKFAST being over  Miss Grandison renewed the talk of the visit made here by Mrs  O Hara on Sunday last  Miss Jervois very prettily expressed her grief for the trouble given her guardian by her unhappy mother  He drew her to him  as he fat  with looks of tenderness  and called her his dear Emily  and told her  she was the Child of his compassion  You are called upon  my dear  said he  young as you are  to a glorious trial  and hitherto you have shone in it  I wish the poor woman would be but half as much the mother  as you would be the child  But let us read her Letter   His goodness overwhelmed her  He took her mother s Letter out of his pocket  She stood before him  drying her eyes  and endeavouring to suppress her emotion  And when he had unfolded the Letter  he put his arm round her waist  Surely  Lucy  he is the tenderest  as well as bravest of men  What would I give for a picture drawn but with half the life and love which shone out in his looks  as he cast his eyes  now on the Letter  and now up to his Emily —Poor woman  said he  two or three times  as he read  And  when he had done  You must read it  my dear  said he  there is the mother in it  We will acknowlege the mother  where ever we can find her   Why did not the dear girl throw her arms about his neck  just then —She was ready to do so  O my best of guardians  said she  and  it was plain  was but just restrained  by virgin modesty  from doing so  her hands caught back  as it were  and resting for a moment on his shoulder  And she looked as much abashed  as if she had not checked herself   I took more notice of this her grateful motion  than any body else  I was affected with the beautiful check  and admired her for it     105 And must I  Sir  would you have me  read it  I will retire to my chamber with it   He arose  took her hand  and  coming with her to me  put it into mine  Be so
