able to work out a reconciliation between you  but she must not know that I was consenting to this marriage  lest an irreconcileable quarrel should ensue  I fell at my father’s feet  and embraced his knees  for this tender and unexpected proof of his affection   Mr Vere’s father was no stranger to his son’s attachment  and we were very sure he would readily come into the proposal which my father intended to make   The two parents had a meeting secretly  where all the terms of portion and settlement were speedily and privately adjusted  Mr Vere the father  who had been long intimate in our family  knew very well the necessity there was for keeping the secret  After this  my lover and I were to be married privately  without the knowlege  seemingly  of any one in either family  excepting one of the Miss Veres  who was to    be present  and when the time of my probation was expired  my father was to let my mother into the knowlege of this affair  as a thing he had just discovered  and to pacify her anger as well he could   Every thing was conducted in the manner proposed  I was married with the utmost privacy  and continued in my father’s house till the day arrived  when I was to give my definitive answer   Unfortunately for me  my mother chose to receive it from my own mouth  and called me into her presence  I appeared before her trembling and terrified  I had not seen her for a fortnight  and I was in dread  lest the discovery I had to make  should banish me her sight perhaps for ever  unless my father might influence her in time to forgive me  She asked me  with a stern brow  What I had resolved on  I had not courage to make her an answer  but burst into tears  She repeated her question  and I could only reply  Madam  it is not in my power to obey you  She did not comprehend the meaning of my words  but imputing them to obstinacy  commanded me to leave the room  and not to see her face till I came to a proper sense of my duty  at the same time ordering me into my chamber  where I was to be locked up   I flew to my father  and conjured him to let my mother know the truth at once  that I might be no longer subject to such harsh treatment  for I knew the being sent home to my husband would be the consequence of her being told that I had one   My poor father was almost afraid to undertake the task  though he had been the chief promoter of my marriage  and his authority ought to have given sanction to it  He ventured however to let her know  that I had confessed to him what my fears of her immediate resentment would not suffer me to discover whilst I was in her presence  and what my aversion to the man she proposed to me  and the rigours I had been threatened with  if I refused him  had driven me to  The rage my mother flew into  was little short of phrenzy  and my father made haste to send me out of the house   Mr Vere’s whole family received me with great tenderness  but I was sorry at leaving my father  whose visits to me were made but seldom  and even those by stealth   My situation  though I was united to the man I loved  and caressed by all his family  was far from being happy  My mother’s inflexible temper was not to be wrought upon  notwithstanding my father did his utmost to prevail on her to see and to forgive me  and she carried her resentment so far  that she told my father  unless he cut me off    entirely in his will  she was determined to separate herself totally from him  This was an extremity he by no means expected she would have gone to   In a fit of sickness  which had seized him a few years before  he had left me ten thousand pounds  five of this he had secretly transferred to Mr Vere on the day of my marriage  and had promised him to bequeath me five more at his death   In consequence of this disposition  he purposed making a new will  so that he the less scrupled giving my mother up the old one  with a promise of making another agreeable to her request   My mother’s jointure was already settled on her  my eldest sister had received her portion  so that there was little bequeathed by this testament  but my fortune  and a few other small legacies   My mother tore the will with indignation  and not satisfied with my father’s promise  insisted on his putting it into execution immediately  In short  his easy temper yielded to her importunities  and he had a will drawn up by her instructions  in which I was cut off with one shilling  and my intended fortune bequeathed to my eldest sister  My mother was made residuary legatee to every thing that should remain  after paying all the bequests  This would have amounted to a considerable sum  if the half of my portion  which was already paid
