was an imprudent one  gratitude and  if the expression is not impertinent  compassion give me a softness in my behaviour to the latter  which a superficial observer would take for love  and which her own tenderness may cause even her to misconstrue  a circumstance which must retard her resolution of changing the affection with which she has honored me  into friendship       I am also delicate in my love  and cannot bear to have it one moment supposed  my heart can know a wish but for my Emily       Shall I say more  The blush on Emily s cheek on her first seeing Madame Des Roches convinced me of my indiscretion  and that vanity alone carried me to desire to bring together two women  whose affection for me is from their extreme merit so very flattering       I shall certainly now fix in Canada  I can no longer doubt of Emily s tenderness  though she refuses me her hand  from motives which make her a thousand times more dear to me  but which I flatter myself love will over rule       I am setting off in an hour for Montreal  and shall call at Silleri to take Emily s commands   Seven in the evening  Des Chambeaux       I asked her advice as to fixing the place of my settlement  she said much against my staying in America at all  but  if I was determined  recommended Lake Champlain rather than the Kamaraskas  on account of climate  Bell smiled  and a blush  which I perfectly understood  over spread the lovely cheek of my sweet Emily  Nothing could be more flattering than this circumstance  had she seen Madame Des Roches with a calm indifference  had she not been alarmed at the idea of fixing near her  I should have doubted of the degree of her affection  a little apprehension is inseparable from real love       My courage has been to day extremely put to the proof  had I staid three days longer  it would have been impossible to have continued my journey       The ice cracks under us at every step the horses set  a rather unpleasant circumstance on a river twenty fathom deep  I should not have attempted the journey had I been aware of this particular  I hope no man meets inevitable danger with more spirit  but no man is less fond of seeking it where it is honorably to be avoided       I am going to sup with the seigneur of the village  who is  I am told  married to one of the handsomest women in the province       Adieu  my dear  I shall write to you from Montreal   Your affectionate  ED  RIVERS     LETTER CXVI   116   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   Montreal  April 3   I AM arrived  my dear  after a very disagreable and dangerous journey  I was obliged to leave the river soon after I left Des Chambeaux  and to pursue my way on the land over melting snow  into which the horses feet sunk half a yard every step       An officer just come from New York has given me a letter from you  which came thither by a private ship  I am happy to hear of your health  and that Temple s affection for you seems rather to increase than lessen since your marriage       You ask me  my dear Lucy  how to preserve this affection  on the continuance of which  you justly say  your whole happiness depends       The question is perhaps the most delicate and important which respects human life  the caprice  the inconstancy  the injustice of men  makes the task of women in marriage infinitely difficult       Prudence and virtue will certainly secure esteem  but  unfortunately  esteem alone will not make a happy marriage  passion must also be kept alive  which the continual presence of the object beloved is too apt to make subside into that apathy  so insupportable to sensible minds       The higher your rank  and the less your manner of life separates you from each other  the more danger there will be of this indifference       The poor  whose necessary avocations divide them all day  and whose sensibility is blunted by the coarseness of their education  are in no danger of being weary of each other  and  unless naturally vicious  you will see them generally happy in marriage  whereas even the virtuous  in more affluent situations  are not secure from this unhappy cessation of tenderness       When I received your letter  I was reading Madame De Maintenon s advice to the Dutchess of Burgundy  on this subject  I will transcribe so much of it as relates to the woman  leaving her advice to the princess to those whom it may concern        Do not hope for perfect happiness  there is no such thing in this sublunary state        Your sex is the more exposed to suffer  because it is always in dependence  be neither angry nor ashamed of this dependence on a husband  nor of any of those which are in the order of Providence        Let your husband be your best friend and your only confidant        Do not hope
