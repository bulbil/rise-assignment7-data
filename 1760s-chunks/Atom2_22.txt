him in the day of his disgrace —Advantage was also taken of the disgust occasioned by Yak strot s reserve among the nobles of Japan  Even the Fatz man was estranged from the councils of his kinsman Giogio  and lent his name and countenance to the malcontents  who now formed themselves into a very formidable cabal  comprehending a great number of the first Quos in the empire   In order to counterballance this confederacy  which was a strange coalition   127 of jarring interests  the new Cuboy endeavoured to strengthen his administration  by admitting into a share of it Gotto mio  who dreaded nothing so much as the continuation of the war  and divers other noblemen  whose alliance contributed very little to his interest or advantage  Gotto mio was universally envied for his wealth  and detested for his avarice  the rest were either of the She itkum sheit el faction  which had been long in disgrace with the Mobile  or men of desperate fortunes and loose morals  who attached themselves to the Ximian favourite solely on account of the posts and pensions he had to bestow   During these domestic commotions  the arms of Japan continued to prosper in the Indian ocean  Thinquo was reduced almost without opposition  and news arrived that the conquest of Fan yah was already   128 more than half atchieved  At the same time  some considerable advantages were gained over the enemy on the continent of Tartary  by the Japonese forces under the command of Bron xi tic  It might be naturally supposed that these events would have  in some measure  reconciled the Niphonites to the new ministry  but they produced rather a contrary effect  The blatant beast was resolved to rejoice at no victories but those that were obtained under the auspices of its beloved Taycho  and now took it highly amiss that Yak strot should presume to take any step which might redound to the glory of the empire  Nothing could have pleased the monster at this juncture so much as the miscarriage of both expeditions  and a certain information that all the troops and ships employed in them had miserably perished  The king of Corea  however  was so   129 alarmed at the progress of the Japonese before Fan yah  that he began to tremble for all his distant colonies  and earnestly craved the advice of the cabinet of Pekin touching some scheme to make a diversion in their favour   The councils of Pekin have been ever fruitful of intrigues to embroil the rest of Asia  They suggested a plan to the king of Corea  which he forthwith put in execution  The land of Fumma  which borders on the Corean territories  was governed by a prince nearly allied to the king of Corea  although his subjects had very intimate connexions in the way of commerce with the empire of Japan  which  indeed  had entered into an offensive and defensive alliance with this country  The emperor of China and the king of Corea having sounded the sovereign of Fumma  and found him well disposed   130 to enter into their measures  communicated their scheme  in which he immediately concurred  They called upon him in public  as their friend and ally  to join them against the Japonese  as the inveterate enemy of the religion of Fo  and as an insolent people  who affected a despotism at sea  to the detriment and destruction of all their neighbours  plainly declaring that he must either immediately break with the Dairo  or expect an invasion on the side of Corea  The prince of Fumma affected to complain loudly of this iniquitous proposal  he made a merit of rejecting the alternative  and immediately demanded of the court of Meaco  the succours stipulated in the treaty of alliance  in order to defend his dominions  In all appearance  indeed  there was no time to be lost  for the monarchs of China and Corea declared war against   131 him without further hesitation  and uniting their forces on that side  ordered them to enter the land of Fumma  after having given satisfactory assurances in private  that the prince had nothing to fear from their hostilities   Yak strot was not much embarrassed on this occasion  Without suspecting the least collusion among the parties  he resolved to take the prince of Fumma under his protection  thereunto moved by divers considerations  First and foremost  he piqued himself upon his good faith  secondly  he knew that the trade with Fumma was of great consequence to Japan  and therefore concluded that his supporting the sovereign of it would be a popular measure  thirdly  he hoped that the multiplication of expence incurred by this new war  would make the blatant beast wince under its burden    132 and of consequence reconcile it to the thoughts of a general pacification  which he had very much at heart  Mean while he hastened the necessary succours to the land of Fumma  and sent thither an old general called Le yaw ter  in order to concert with the prince and his ministers the operations of the campaign   This officer was counted one of the shrewdest politicians in Japan  and having resided many years as ambassador in Fumma  was well acquainted with the genius of that people  He immediately discovered the scene which had been acted behind the curtain  He found that the prince of Fumma  far from having made any preparations for his
