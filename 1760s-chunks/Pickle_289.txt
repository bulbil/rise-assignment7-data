the future  they resolved  that a grate should be    6 22 15  3 45 PM   fixed in the middle of the outward door  through which the conjurer  himself might reconnoitre all the visitants  before their admission  so  that  to those whose appearance he might not like  Hadgi should  without  opening  give notice  that his master was engaged  By this expedient  too  they provided against those difficulties which Cadwallader must  have encountered  in giving satisfaction to strangers  whom he did not  know  for the original intention of the founders was to confine the  practice of their art to people of fashion only  most of whom were  personally known to the counterfeit magician and his coadjutors   Indeed these associates  Cadwallader in particular  notwithstanding his  boasted insight into the characters of life  never imagined that his  pretended skill would be consulted by any but the weaker minded of  the female sex  incited by that spirit of curiosity which he knew was  implanted in their nature  but  in the course of his practice  he found  himself cultivated in his preternatural capacity by people of all sexes   complexions  and degrees of reputation  and had occasion to observe   that  when the passions are concerned  howsoever cool  cautious  and  deliberate the disposition may otherwise be  there is nothing so idle   frivolous  or absurd  to which they will not apply for encouragement  and gratification  The last occurrence  according to the hopes and  expectation of the confederates  was whispered about by the ladies  concerned  in such a manner  that the whole affair was in a few days the  universal topic of discourse  in which it was retailed with numberless  embellishments  invented by the parties themselves  who had long  indulged a pique at each other  and took this opportunity of enjoying  their revenge   These incidents  while they regaled the spleen  at the same time  augmented the renown of the conjurer  who was described on both sides as  a very extraordinary person in his way  and the alteration in his door  was no sooner performed  than he had occasion to avail himself of it   against the intrusion of a great many  with whom he would have found it  very difficult to support the fame he had acquired   Among those who appeared at his grate  he perceived a certain clergyman   whom he had long known a humble attendant on the great  and with some  the reputed minister of their pleasures  This Levite had disguised  himself in a greatcoat  boots  and dress quite foreign to the habit  worn by those of his function  and  being admitted  attempted to impose  himself as a country squire upon the conjurer  who  calling him by his  name  desired him to sit down  This reception corresponding with the  report he had heard  touching our magician s art  the doctor said he  would lay aside all dissimulation  After having professed an implicit  belief  that his supernatural knowledge did not proceed from any  communication with evil spirits  but was the immediate gift of Heaven   he declared the intention of his coming  was to inquire into the health  of a good friend and brother of his  who possessed a certain living in  the country  which he named  and  as he was old and infirm  to know what  space of time was allotted to him in this frail state of mortality  that  he might have the melancholy satisfaction of attending him in his last  moments  and assisting him in his preparations for eternity   The conjurer  who at once perceived the purport of this question   after a solemn pause  during which he seemed absorbed in contemplation   delivered this response to his consulter   Though I foresee some  occurrences  I do not pretend to be omniscient  I know not to what age    6 22 15  3 45 PM   that clergyman s life will extend  but so far I can penetrate into  the womb of time  as to discern  that the incumbent will survive his  intended successor   This dreadful sentence in a moment banished the  blood from the face of the appalled consulter  who  hearing his own doom  pronounced  began to tremble in every joint  he lifted up his eyes in  the agony of fear  and saying   The will of God be done   withdrew in  silent despondence  his teeth chattering with terror and dismay   This client was succeeded by an old man about the age of seventy five   who  being resolved to purchase a lease  desired to be determined in the  term of years by the necromancer s advice  observing  that  as he had  no children of his own body  and had no regard for his heirs at law   the purchase would be made with a view to his own convenience only  and  therefore  considering his age  he himself hesitated in the period of  the lease  between thirty and three score years   The conjurer  upon due deliberation
