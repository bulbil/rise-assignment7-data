 dashing off the necessary amount of manuscript in an hour or so just before the departure of the post  If the story is true  it adds its testimony to that of his works to the author s extraordinarily facile pen  Finally  in 1762  the novel thus hurried off in instalments appeared as a whole  This method of its introduction to the public gives Sir Launcelot Greaves still another claim to interest  It is one of the earliest English novels  indeed the earliest from the pen of a great writer  published in serial form   G  H  MAYNADIER           THE ADVENTURES OF SIR LAUNCELOT GREAVES            CHAPTER ONE  IN WHICH CERTAIN PERSONAGES OF THIS DELIGHTFUL HISTORY ARE INTRODUCED TO THE READER S ACQUAINTANCE   It was on the great northern road from York to London  about the beginning of the month of October  and the hour of eight in the evening  that four travellers were  by a violent shower of rain  driven for shelter into a little public house on the side of the highway  distinguished by a sign which was said to exhibit the figure of a black lion  The kitchen  in which they assembled  was the only room for entertainment in the house  paved with red bricks  remarkably clean  furnished with three or four Windsor chairs  adorned with shining plates of pewter  and copper saucepans  nicely scoured  that even dazzled the eyes of the  beholder  while a cheerful fire of sea coal blazed in the chimney  Three of the travellers  who arrived on horseback  having seen their cattle properly accommodated in the stable  agreed to pass the time  until the weather should clear up  over a bowl of rumbo  which was accordingly prepared  But the fourth  refusing to join their company  took his station at the opposite side of the chimney  and called for a pint of twopenny  with which he indulged himself apart  At a little distance  on his left hand  there was another group  consisting of the landlady  a decent widow  her two daughters  the elder of whom seemed to be about the age of fifteen  and a country lad  who served both as waiter and ostler   The social triumvirate was composed of Mr  Fillet  a country practitioner in surgery and midwifery  Captain Crowe  and his nephew Mr  Thomas Clarke  an attorney  Fillet was a man of some education  and a great deal of experience  shrewd  sly  and sensible  Captain Crowe had commanded a merchant ship in the Mediterranean trade for many years  and saved some money by dint of frugality and traffic  He was an excellent seaman  brave  active  friendly in his way  and scrupulously honest  but as little acquainted with the world as a sucking child  whimsical  impatient  and so impetuous  that he could not help breaking in upon the conversation  whatever it might be  with repeated interruptions  that seemed to burst from him by involuntary impulse  When he himself attempted to speak he never finished his period  but made such a number of abrupt transitions  that his discourse seemed to be an unconnected series of unfinished sentences  the meaning of which it was not easy to decipher   His nephew  Tom Clarke  was a young fellow  whose goodness of heart even the exercise of his profession had not been able to corrupt  Before strangers he never owned himself an attorney without blushing  though he had no reason to blush for his own practice  for he constantly refused to engage in the cause of any client whose character was equivocal  and was never known to act with such industry as when concerned for the widow and orphan  or any other object that sued in forma pauperis  Indeed  he was so replete with human kindness  that as often as an affecting story or circumstance was told in his hearing  it overflowed at his eyes  Being of a warm complexion  he was very susceptible of passion  and somewhat libertine in his amours  In other respects  he piqued himself on understanding the practice of the courts  and in private company he took pleasure in laying down the law  but he was an indifferent orator  and tediously circumstantial in his explanations  His stature was rather diminutive  but  upon the whole  he had some title to the character of a pretty  dapper  little fellow   The solitary guest had something very forbidding in his aspect  which was contracted by an habitual frown  His eyes were small and red  and so deep set in the sockets  that each appeared like the unextinguished snuff of a farthing candle  gleaming through the horn of a dark lanthorn  His nostrils were elevated in scorn  as if his sense of smelling had been perpetually offended by some unsavoury odour  and he looked as if he wanted to shrink within himself from the impertinence of society  He wore a black periwig as straight as the pinions of a raven  and this was covered with a hat flapped  and fastened to his head by a speckled handkerchief tied under his chin  He was wrapped in a greatcoat of brown frieze  under which he seemed to conceal a small bundle  His
