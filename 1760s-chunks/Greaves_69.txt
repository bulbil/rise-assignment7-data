letter  accosted him in these words   Please your noble honour  if your honour be Sir Launcelot Greaves of the West Riding  here s a letter from a gentlewoman  that I promised to deliver into your honour s own hands    The knight  snatching the letter with the utmost avidity  broke it up  and found the contents couched in these terms —   HONOURED SIR —The man az gi en me leave to lat yaw knaw my dear leady is going to Loondon with her unkle Squaire Darnel  Be not conzarned  honoured sir  vor I se take it on mai laife to let yaw knaw wheare we be zettled  if zobe I can vind where you loadge in Loondon  The man zays yaw may put it in the pooblic prints  I houp the bareheir will be honest enuff to deliver this scrowl  and that your honour will pardon Your umbil servant to command  DOROTHY COWSLIP     P  S —Please my kaind sarvice to laayer Clarke  Squire Darnel s man is very civil vor sartain  but I ave no thoughts on him I ll assure yaw  Marry hap  worse ware may have a better chap  as the zaying goes    Nothing could be more seasonable than the delivery of this billet  which he had no sooner perused than his reflection returned  and he entered into a serious deliberation with his own heart  He considered that Aurelia was by this time far beyond a possibility of being overtaken  and that by a precipitate pursuit he should only expose his own infirmities  He confided in the attachment of his mistress  and in the fidelity of her maid  who would find opportunities of communicating her sentiments by means of this lacquey  of whom he perceived by the letter she had already made a conquest  He therefore resolved to bridle his impatience  to proceed leisurely to London  and  instead of taking any rash step which might induce Anthony Darnel to remove his niece from that city  remain in seeming quiet until she should be settled  and her guardian returned to the country  Aurelia had mentioned to him the name of Doctor Kawdle  and from him he expected in due time to receive the most interesting information formerly tormented with the pangs of despairing love  which had actually unsettled his understanding  he was now happily convinced that he had inspired the tender breast of Aurelia with mutual affection  and  though she was invidiously snatched from his embrace in the midst of such endearments as had wound up his soul to ecstasy and transport  he did not doubt of being able to rescue her from the power of an inhuman kinsman  whose guardianship would soon of course expire  and in the meantime he rested with the most perfect dependence on her constancy and virtue   As he next day crossed the country  ruminating on the disaster that had befallen his squire  and could now compare circumstances coolly  he easily comprehended the whole scheme of that adventure  which was no other than an artifice of Anthony Darnel and his emissaries to draw him from the inn  where he proposed to execute his design upon the innocent Aurelia  He took it for granted that the uncle  having been made acquainted with his niece s elopement  had followed her track by the help of such information as he received  from one stage to another  and that  receiving more particulars at the White Hart touching Sir Launcelot  he had formed the scheme in which Crabshaw was an involuntary instrument towards the seduction of his master   Amusing himself with these and other cogitations  our hero in the afternoon reached the place of his destination  and  entering the inn where Timothy had been left at sick quarters  chanced to meet the apothecary retiring precipitately in a very unsavoury pickle from the chamber of his patient  When he inquired about the health of his squire  this retainer to medicine  wiping himself all the while with a napkin  answered in manifest confusion  that he apprehended him to be in a very dangerous way from an inflammation of the piamater  which had produced a most furious delirium  Then he proceeded to explain  in technical terms  the method of cure he had followed  and concluded with telling him the poor squire s brain was so outrageously disordered  that he had rejected all administration  and just thrown an urinal in his face   The knight s humanity being alarmed at this intelligence  he resolved that Crabshaw should have the benefit of further advice  and asked if there was not a physician in the place  The apothecary  after some interjections of hesitation  owned there was a doctor in the village  an odd sort of a humourist  but he believed he had not much to do in the way of his profession  and was not much used to the forms of prescription  He was counted a scholar  to be sure  but as to his medical capacity—he would not take upon him to say   No matter   cried Sir Launcelot   he may strike out some lucky thought for the benefit of the patient  and I desire you will call him instantly    While the apothecary was absent on this service  our adventurer took it in his head to question the landlord about the character of this physician  which had been so unfavourably represented  and
