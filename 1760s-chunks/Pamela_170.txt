and goodness   to me   But I will tell you all the truth  And then I recounted to him   the whole affair of the gipsy  and how the letter was put among the   loose grass  etc  And he said  The man who thinks a thousand dragons   sufficient to watch a woman  when her inclination takes a contrary bent    will find all too little  and she will engage the stones in the   street  or the grass in the field  to act for her  and help on her   correspondence  If the mind  said he  be not engaged  I see there is   hardly any confinement sufficient for the body  and you have told me a   very pretty story  and  as you never gave me any reason to question your   veracity  even in your severest trials  I make no doubt of the truth   of what you have now mentioned  and I will  in my turn  give you such a   proof of mine  that you shall find it carry a conviction with it       You must know  then  my Pamela  that I had actually formed such a   project  so well informed was this old rascally Somebody  and the time   was fixed for the very person described in this letter to be here  and I   had thought he should have read some part of the ceremony  as little as   was possible  to deceive you  in my chamber  and so I hoped to have you   mine upon terms that then would have been much more agreeable to me than   real matrimony  And I did not in haste intend you the mortification of   being undeceived  so that we might have lived for years  perhaps  very   lovingly together  and I had  at the same time  been at liberty to   confirm or abrogate it as I pleased       O sir  said I  I am out of breath with the thoughts of my danger  But   what good angel prevented the execution of this deep laid design       Why  your good angel  Pamela  said he  for when I began to consider    that it would have made you miserable  and me not happy  that if you   should have a dear little one  it would be out of my own power to   legitimate it  if I should wish it to inherit my estate  and that  as I   am almost the last of my family  and most of what I possess must   descend to a strange line  and disagreeable and unworthy persons    notwithstanding that I might  in this case  have issue of my own body    when I further considered your untainted virtue  what dangers and   trials you had undergone by my means  and what a world of troubles I had   involved you in  only because you were beautiful and virtuous  which   had excited all my passion for you  and reflected also upon your tried   prudence and truth  I  though I doubted not effecting this my last plot    resolved to overcome myself  and  however I might suffer in struggling   with my affection for you  to part with you  rather than to betray   you under so black a veil  Besides  said he  I remember how much I had   exclaimed against and censured an action of this kind  that had been   attributed to one of the first men of the law  and of the kingdom  as he   afterwards became  and that it was but treading in a path that another   had marked out for me  and  as I was assured  with no great satisfaction   to himself  when he came to reflect  my foolish pride was a little   piqued with this  because I loved to be  if I went out of the way  my   own original  as I may call it  On all these considerations it was  that   I rejected this project  and sent word to the person  that I had better   considered of the matter  and would not have him come  till he   heard further from me  And  in this suspense I suppose  some of your   confederates  Pamela   for we have been a couple of plotters  though   your virtue and merit have procured you faithful friends and partisans    which my money and promises could hardly do   one way or other got   knowledge of it  and gave you this notice  but  perhaps  it would have   come too late  had not your white angel got the better of my black one    and inspired me with resolutions to abandon the project  just as it   was to have been put into execution  But yet I own  that  from these   appearances  you were but too well justified in your fears  on this
