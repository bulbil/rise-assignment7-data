just going off in a boat to the ship  takes the care of this       May every happiness attend my dear girl  Say every thing affectionate for me to Captain Fermor and Mr  Fitzgerald       Adieu  Yours   EMILY MONTAGUE     LETTER CLXII   162   To Miss FERMOR  at Silleri   London  July 19   I GOT to town last night  my dear  and am at a friend s  from whence I have this morning sent to Mrs  Rivers  I every moment expect her answer  my anxiety of mind is not to be expressed  my heart sinks  I almost dread the return of my messenger       If the affections  my dear friend  give us the highest happiness of which we are capable  they are also the source of our keenest misery  what I feel at this instant  is not to be described  I have been near resolving to go into the country without seeing or sending to Mrs  Rivers  If she should receive me with coldness why should I have exposed myself to the chance of such a reception  It would have been better to have waited for Rivers s arrival  I have been too precipitate  my warmth of temper has misled me  what had I to do to seek his family  I would give the world to retract my message  though it was only to let her know I was arrived  that her son was well  and that she might every hour expect him in England       There is a rap at the door  I tremble I know not why  the servant comes up  he announces Mr  and Mrs  Temple  my heart beats  they are at the door   One o clock       They are gone  and return for me in an hour  they insist on my dining with them  and tell me Mrs  Rivers is impatient to see me  Nothing was ever so polite  so delicate  so affectionate  as the behaviour of both  they saw my confusion  and did every thing to remove it  they enquired after Rivers  but without the least hint of the dear interest I take in him  they spoke of the happiness of knowing me  they asked my friendship  in a manner the most flattering that can be imagined  How strongly does Mrs  Temple  my dear  resemble her amiable brother  her eyes have the same sensibility  the same pleasing expression  I think I scarce ever saw so charming a woman  I love her already  I feel a tenderness for her  which is inconceivable  I caught myself two or three times looking at her  with an attention for which I blushed        How dear to me is every friend of my Rivers       I believe  there was something very foolish in my behaviour  but they had the good breeding and humanity not to seem to observe it       I had almost forgot to tell you  they said every thing obliging and affectionate of you and Captain Fermor        My mind is in a state not to be described  I feel joy  I feel anxiety  I feel doubt  I feel a timidity I cannot conquer  at the thought of seeing Mrs  Rivers       I have to dress  therefore must finish this when I return   Twelve at night       I am come back  my dearest Bell  I have gone through the scene I so much dreaded  and am astonished I should ever think of it but with pleasure  How much did I injure this most amiable of women  Her reception of me was that of a tender parent  who had found a long lost child  she kissed me  she pressed me to her bosom  her tears flowed in abundance  she called me her daughter  her other Lucy  she asked me a thousand questions of her son  she would know all that concerned him  however minute  how he looked  whether he talked much of her  what were his amusements  whether he was as handsome as when he left England       I answered her with some hesitation  but with a pleasure that animated my whole soul  I believe  I never appeared to such advantage as this day       You will not ascribe it to an unmeaning vanity  when I tell you  I never took such pains to please  I even gave a particular attention to my dress  that I might  as much as possible  justify my Rivers s tenderness  I never was vain for myself  but I am so for him  I am indifferent to admiration as Emily Montague  but as the object of his love  I would be admired by all the world  I wish to be the first of my sex in all that is amiable and lovely  that I might make a sacrifice worthy of my Rivers  in shewing to all his friends  that he only can inspire me with tenderness  that I live for him alone       Mrs  Rivers pressed me extremely to pass a month with her  my heart yielded too easily to her request  but I had courage to resist my own wishes  as well as
