Thursday morning my lady set out for her own seat  and my best friend   and I  attended by Mr  Colbrand  Abraham  and Thomas  for this   dear house  Her ladyship parted with her brother and me with great   tenderness  and made me promise to send her my papers  which I find   she intends to entertain Lady Betty with  and another lady or two  her   intimates  as also her lord  and hopes to find  as I believe  in the   reading of them  some excuse for her brother s choice       My dearest master has been all love and tenderness on the road  as he is   in every place  and on every occasion  And oh  what a delightful change   was this journey  to that which  so contrary to all my wishes  and so   much to my apprehensions  carried me hence to the Lincolnshire house    And how did I bless God at every turn  and at every stage       We did not arrive here till yesterday noon  Abraham rode before  to let   them know we were coming  and I had the satisfaction to find every body   there I wished to see       When the chariot entered the court yard  I was so strongly impressed   with the favour and mercies of God Almighty  on remembering how I was   sent away the last time I saw this house  the leave I took  the dangers   I had encountered  a poor cast off servant girl  and now returning a   joyful wife  and the mistress  through his favour  of the noble house I   was turned out of  that I was hardly able to support the joy I felt in   my mind on the occasion  He saw how much I was moved  and tenderly asked   me  Why I seemed so affected  I told him  and lifted his dear hand to   my lips  and said  O sir  God s mercies  and your goodness to me on   entering this dear  dear place  are above my expression  I can hardly   bear the thoughts of them   He said  Welcome  thrice welcome  joy of my   life  to your own house  and kissed my hand in return  All the common   servants stood at the windows  as unseen as they could  to observe us    He took my hand  with the most condescending goodness in the world  and    with great complaisance  led me into the parlour  and kissed me with   the greatest ardour  Welcome again  my dearest life  said he  a thousand   times welcome to the possession of a house that is not more mine than   yours       I threw myself at his feet  Permit me  dear sir  thus to bless God  and   thank you  for all his mercies and your goodness  O may I so behave  as   not to be utterly unworthy  and then how happy shall I be  God give me    my dearest  said he  life and health to reward all your sweetness  and   no man can be so blest as I       Where  said he to Abraham  who passed by the door   where is Mrs    Jervis   She bolted in  Here  good sir  said she  here  good madam  am   I  waiting impatiently  till called for  to congratulate you both   I   ran to her  and clasped my arms about her neck  and kissed her  O my   dear Mrs  Jervis  said I  my other dear mother  receive your happy    happy Pamela  and join with me to bless God  and bless our master  for   all these great things   I was ready to sink in her arms through excess   of joy  to see the dear good woman  who had been so often a mournful   witness of my distress  as now of my triumph   Dearest madam  said she    you do me too much honour  Let my whole life shew the joy I take in your   deserved good fortune  and in my duty to you  for the early instance I   received of your goodness in your kind letter  O Mrs  Jervis  replied   I  there all thanks are due  both from you and me  for our dear master   granted me this blessing  as I may justly call it  the very first   moment I begged it of him  Your goodness  sir  said she  I will for ever   acknowledge  and I beg pardon for the wrong step I made in applying to   my Lady Davers   He was so good as to salute her  and said  All is over   now  Mrs  Jervis  and I shall not
