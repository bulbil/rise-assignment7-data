that she always   used those worst  who used her best      I have often told you that sensuality is disagreeable to a spiritual   being  I  therefore  longed to quit this mistress  the succession of   whose amours was so constant and quick  that I was astonished   how nature could afford a fund of love for them aU in so young a   creature   for she was not twenty years old  I see you have a   curiosity to know the history of this young votary of Venus  in   which you think there must be something extraordinary   but you   are deceived   it contains nothing but common occurrences      She was the daughter of tradespeople  in moderate circumstances    whose foohsh fondness  because she was a pretty  smart child  gave   her an education above her rank  in hopes of her making her fortune   by marriage      This raised the vanity natural to the female heart so high  that   she despised her own station  and not being so fortunate as immedi    ately to climb to the one she desired  by the way proposed  she         74 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     fell an easy victim to the first seducer who promised it in any   other      Thus the accomplishments  by which the injudicious tenderness   of her parents meant to raise her into a rank higher than their own   became the cause of her faUinginto that of the lowest of all human   beings   a fall  though deplorable in itself  yet unafFecting to her    as the time in which her mind should have been formed to virtue   was given up to the nourishing that vanity which proved her ruin     so that she is absolutely insensible of the wretche hiess of her con    dition  and never has the pursuit of her most infamous profession   disturbed her by a moment s remorse      I told you of her spending the hours that were unemployed at     home  at an house in Street  where she was always sure of     business  Though this venerable mansion was dedicated to the   mysterious rites of unrestrained love  yet  as the priests of all temples   expect to live by the offerings made at them  her conscience would   not permit the priestess of this to break through an ordinance so   long established  and she exacted fees from the votaries of her s     not indeed a tithe indiscriminately from aU  whether they received   benefit from their devotion or not  but always in proportion to the   fruits they reaped      At this shrine was I offered the third night of my being in the   possession of this young devotee  when the plenteousness of her   gain from a multitude of lovers seemed to her piety to merit so   rich a return      I now entered into a much more extensive scene than my last    the prostitution of which made but a small part of the business of   the profession  But what I have related in the history of my late   mistress shall suffice for that branch  nor shall I give more than   some outlines of the horrors of the rest      My new mistress had originally been of the sisterhood of my last    who  having fallen a prey to lust  almost in her infancy  and having   no beauty  nor anything but extreme youth to recommend her    as soon as that was worn out  neglect obhged her to apply to other   business for bread  and her natural turn determining her to this    as well as the outrageous virtue of the undiscovered part of her   own sex excluding her from every other  she changed her occupation   from yielding to providing pleasure  in which her success was so   great that she soon became the most eminent of her profession      It was near five in the morning when I changed my service   and   business being ended  my late mistress having reigned sole mistress   of the night  and seen out aU the company  there remained nothing   to do  after she went home  but to see the inmates to their truckle    beds in the cock lofts   where stripping off every part  not only of the   finery  but even of the comforts of dress  they were crowded three   or four together  to keep each other warm  under a ragged coverlet    upon a bare mattress  where their shudderings and groans made a   just contrast to the spirited wickedness of their conversation some   hours before      This was always the fate of those who were not so successful   in the evening as to earn the price of a better bed  above the fees
