of good sense  which almost incessantly gleam through the chaos of their absurdities   Japan was originally governed by monarchs who possessed an absolute power  and succeeded by hereditary right  under the title of Dairo  But in the beginning of the period Foggien  this emperor became a cypher  and the whole administration devolved into the hands of the prime minister  or Cuboy  who now exercises all the power and authority  leaving the trappings of royalty to the inactive Dairo  The prince  who held the reins of government in the short period which I intend to record  was not a lineal descendant of the antient Dairos  the immediate succession having sailed  but sprung from a collateral branch which was invited from a foreign country in the person of Bupo  in honour of whom the Japonese erected Fakkubasi   or the    16 temple of the white horse  So much were all his successors devoted to the culture of this idol  which  by the bye  was made of the vilest materials  that  in order to enrich his shrine  they impoverished the whole empire  yet still with the connivance  and by the influence of the Cuboy  who gratified this sordid passion or superstition of the Dairo  with a view to prevent him from employing his attention on matters of greater consequence   Nathaniel  You have heard of the transmigration of souls  a doctrine avowed by one Pythagoras  a philosopher of Crotona  This doctrine  though discarded and reprobated by christians  is nevertheless sound  and orthodox  I affirm on the integrity of an atom  Further I shall not explain myself on this subject  though I might with safety set the convocation and the whole hierarchy at defiance  knowing  as I do  that it is not in their    17 power to make me bate one particle of what I advance  or  if they should endeavour to reach me through your organs  and even condemn you to the stake at Smithfield  verily  I say unto thee  I should be a gainer by the next remove  I should shift my quarters from a very cold and empty tenement  which I now occupy in the brain of a poor haberdasher  to the nervous plexus situated at the mouth of the stomach of a fat aldermand fed with venison and turtle   But to return to Pythagoras  whom one of your wise countrymen denominated Peter Gore  the wise acre of Croton  you must know that philosopher was a type  which hath not yet been fully unveiled  That he taught the metempsychosis  explained the nature and property of harmonies  demonstrated the motion of the earth  discovered the elements of geometry and arithmetic  enjoined his disciples silence  and abstained from eating    18 any thing that was ever informed by the breath of life  are circumstances known to all the learned world  but his veneration for beans  which cost him his life  his golden thigh  his adventures in the character of a courtezan  his golden verses  his epithet of 〈 in non Latin alphabet 〉  the fable of his being born of a virgin  and his descent into hell  are mysteries in which some of the most important truths are concealed —Between friends  honest Nathaniel  I myself constituted part of that sage s body  and I could say a great deal—but there is a time for all things —I shall only observe  that Philip Tessier had some reason for supposing Pythagoras to have been a monk  and there are shrewd hints in Meyer s dissertation  Utrum Pythagoras Judaeus fuit  an monachus Carmelita   Waving these intricate discussions for the present   though I cannot help disclosing that Pythagoras was actually    19 circumcised  know  Peacock  that the metempsychosis  or transmigration of souls  is the method which nature and fate constantly pursue  in animating the creatures produced on the face of the earth  and this process  with some variation  is such as the eleusinian mysteries imported  and such as you have read in Dryden s translation of the sixth book of Virgil s Aeneid  The Gods have provided a great magazine or diversorium  to which the departed souls of all animals repair at their dismission from the body  Here they are bathed in the waters of oblivion  until they retain no memory of the scenes through which they have passed  but they still preserve their original crasis and capacity  From this repository  all new created beings are supplied with souls  and these souls transmigrate into different animals  according to the pleasure of the great disposer  For example  my good friend Nathaniel Peacock  your    20 own soul has within these hundred years threaded a goat  a spider  and a bishop  and its next stage will be the carcase of a brewer s horse   In what manner we atoms come by these articles of intelligence  whether by intuition  or communication of ideas  it is not necessary that you should conceive—Suffice it to say  the gods were merry on the follies of mankind  and Mercury undertook to exhibit a mighty nation  ruled and governed by the meanest intellects that could be found in the repository of pre existing spirits  He laid the scene in Japan  about the middle of the period Foggien  when that nation was at peace with all her neighbours
