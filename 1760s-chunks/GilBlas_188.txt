laden with a large wallet which he had not forgotten among the number of his purchases  went for the first time to reconnoitre the town of Cuença  which is but a very short distance from the hermitage  With a mortified exterior  by which nature had dubbed him for a cheat  and the art of making that natural deception go as far as possible  by a most hypocritical and factitious array of features  he could not fail to play upon the feelings of the charitable and humane  and those whom heaven has blessed with affluence  His knapsack bore testimony to the extravagance of their pious liberalities  Master Ambrose  said  I on his return  I congratulate you on your happy knack at softening the souls of all good Christians  As we hope to be saved  one would suppose that you had been a mendicant friar among the Capuchins  I have done something else besides bringing in food for the convent  answered he  You must know that I have ferreted out a certain lass called Barbara  with whom I used to flirt formerly  She is as much altered as any of us  for she also has addicted herself to a godly life  She forms a coterie with two or three other sanctified dames  who are an example to the faithful in public  and flounce over head and ears in every sort of private vice  She did not know me again at first  What then  mistress Barbara  said I  is it possible that you should have discharged one of your oldest friends from your remembrance  your servant Ambrose  As I am a true Christian  Signor de Lamela  exclaimed she  I never thought to have turned you up in such a garb as that  By what transformation are you become a hermit  This is more than I can tell you just now  rejoined I  The particulars are rather long  but I will come to morrow evening and satisfy your curiosity  Nay  more  I will bring brother Juan  my companion  along with me  Brother Juan  interrupted she  the venerable hermit who has taken up his saintly residence near this town  You do not know what you are saying  he is supposed to be more than a hundred years old  It is very true  said I  that he was of that age some little while ago  but time  in deference to his sanctity  has gone backward with him  and he is grown considerably younger within these few days  He is at present just about my turn of life  Say you so  Then let us have him too  replied Barbara  I perceive there is something more in this mystery than the church will be able to explain   We did not miss our appointment with these whited sepulchres on the following night To make our reception the more agreeable  they had laid out a sumptuous entertainment  Off went our beards and cowls  and vestments of mortification  and without any squeamishness we confessed our birth  education  and real character  to these sisters in hypocrisy  On their part  for fear of being behindhand with us in freedom from prejudice  they fairly let us see of what pretended religionists are capable  when they drop the veil of the sanctuary  and exhibit their unmanufactured faces  We spent almost the whole night at table  and got back to our grotto but a moment before daybreak  We were not long in repeating our visit  or  if the truth must be told  it was nightly for three months  till we had ate up more than two thirds of our ways and means in the company of these delicate creatures  But an unsuccessful candidate for their favour got wind of our proceedings  and prated of our whereabout in the ear of justice  which was to have been in motion towards the hermitage this very day  to lay hold of our persons  Yesterday Ambrose  while picking up eleemosynary at Cuença  stumbled upon one of our whining sisterhood  who gave him a note  with this caution  A female friend of mine has written me this letter  which I was going to send to you by a man on purpose  Shew it to brother Juan  and regulate your proceedings accordingly  It was this very note  gentlemen  that Lamela gave me in your presence  which occasioned us to take so abrupt a leave of our solitary dwelling       CH  II    Don Raphael s consultation with his company  and their adventures as they were preparing to leave the wood   WHEN Don Raphael had finished the narrative of his adventurous life  which  with all the other qualities of a romance  had the tediousness  Don Alphonso  according to the laws of good breeding  swore himself black in the face that he had been prodigiously entertained  After the usual exchange of compliments  Signor Ambrose put in his oar  with an admonitory hint to the partner of his exploits and peregrinations  Consider  Don Raphael  that the sun is setting  It would not be amiss  methinks  to take counsel on what we are to do  You are in the right  answered his comrade  we must determine on the place of our destination  For my own part  replied Lamela  I am of opinion that we should
