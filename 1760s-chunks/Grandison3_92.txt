brothers  with a chearful aspect at table  especially before the Patriarch  Do not  madam  in silence—  You find  Sir  I have been talkative enough with you  —Shall we go thro  your Shakespeare s Hamlet  to night —Farewel  Chevalier  I will try to be chearful at table  But let not your eye  if I am not  reproach me —She took another walk   I was loth  my dear Dr  Bartlett  to impute to myself   227 the consequence with this amiable Lady  that might but naturally be inferred from the turn which the conversation took  but I thought it no more than justice to the whole family  to hasten my departure  And when I hinted to Clementina  that I should soon take leave of them  I was rejoiced to find her unconcerned   This  my good Miss Byron  is what I find in my patron s Letters relating to this conference  He takes notice  that the young Lady behaved herself at table as she was wished to do   Mr  Grandison was prevailed upon  by the intreaties of the whole family  to suspend his departure for a few days   The young Lady s melancholy  to the inexpressible affliction of her friends  increased  yet she behaved with so much greatness of mind  that neither her mother nor her Camilla could persuade themselves that Love was the cause  They sometimes imagined  that the earnestness with which they solicited the interest of the Count of Belvedere with her  had hurried and affected her delicate spirits  and therefore they were resolved to say little more on that subject till they should see her disposed to lend a more favourable ear to it  And the Count retired to his own palace in Parma  expecting and hoping for such a turn in his favour  For he declared  That it was impossible for him to think of any other woman for a wife   But Signor Jeronymo doubted not  all this time  of the cause  and  without letting any body into his opinion  not even Mr  Grandison  for fear a disappointment would affect him  resolved to make use of every opportunity that should offer  in favour of the man he loved  from a principle of gratitude  that reigned with exemplary force in the breast of every one of this noble family  a principle which took the firmer root in their hearts  as the prudence  generosity    228 magnanimity  and other great and equally amiable qualities of Mr  Grandison  appeared every day more and more conspicuous to them all   I will soon  madam  present you with farther extracts from the Letters in my possession  in pursuance of the articles you have given me in writing  I am not a little proud of my task   Continuation of Miss Byron s Letter   Begun p  199   CAN you not  Lucy  gather from the setting out of this story  and the short account of it given by Sir Charles in the Library conference  that I shall soon pay my duty to you all in Northamptonshire  I shall  indeed   Is it not strange  my dear  that a father and mother  and brothers  so jealous as Italians  in general  are said to be  of their women  and so proud as this Bologna family is represented to be of their rank  should all agree to give so fine a man  as this is  in mind  person and address  such free access to their daughter  a young Lady of Eighteen   Teach her English —Very discreet in the father and mother  surely  And to commission him to talk with the poor girl in favour of a man whom they wished her to marry —Indeed you will say  perhaps  that by the honourable expedient they fell upon  unknown to either tutor or pupil  of listening to all that was to pass in the conference  they found a method to prove his integrity  and that  finding it proof  they were justified to prudence in their future confidence   With all my heart  Lucy  If you will excuse these parents  you may  But I say  that any body  tho  not of Italy  might have thought such a tutor as this was dangerous to a young Lady  and the more  for being a man of honour and family  In every case  the teacher is the obliger  He is called master  you know  And where there is a master  a servant is implied    229 Who is it that seeks not out for a married man  among the common tribe of tutors  whether professing music  dancing  languages  science of any kind  But a tutor such a one as this —  Well  but I will leave them to pay the price of their indiscretion   I AM this moment come from the doctor  I insinuated to him  as artfully as I could  some of the above observations  He reminded me  that the Marchioness herself had her education at Paris  and says  that the manners of the Italians are very much altered of late years  and that the French freedom begins to take place among the people of condition  in a very visible manner
