was his business to undermine in silence and security  The Cardinals were even heard facetiously to declare    that the King should be excommunicated for thus endeavouring to overturn the small remains of Popery that yet subsisted in England     James  notwithstanding his discouragements  was yet resolved to prosecute his favourite scheme with vigour  Upon every occasion the Catholics shared his confidence and favour  Hugh Peters  his confessor  ruled his conscience  and drove him blindly forward to attempt innovation  He became every day more and more ambitious of making converts  the Earl of Sunderland sacrificed his religion to his ambition  the Earl of Rochester lost his employment of treasurer for refusing to alter his religion  The King stooped so low as to his officers  a rough soldier one day answered his remonstrances by saying that he was pre engaged  for he had promised the King of Morocco  when he was quartered at   74 Tangiers  that  should he ever change his religion  he would turn Mahometan   An Ecclesiastical Court was erected  with power to punish all delinquents  or such so reputed by the court  with all manner of ecclesiastical censures  Before this court was summoned the Vice chancellor of Cambridge  for having refused to admit one Francis  a Benedictine Monk  to the degree of master of arts  the Vice chancellor was deprived of his office  but the university persisted in their refusal  and the King thought proper to desist from his purpose  The Vice president and fellows of Magdalen college in Oxford were treated with more severity  They refused to admit one Farmer  a new convert  and one of a profligate life  who was nominated by the King to the place of President  now become vacant  The King next nominated Parker  Bishop of Oxford  but he was equally obnoxious for the same reasons  The King repaired in person to Oxford  he reproached the fellows with insolence and disobedience  but neither he  nor his ministers  could prevail to alter the resolutions of this society  The fellows were expelled by his order  and their places filled with Papists  who he knew would be more obedient to his commands   His designs hitherto were sufficiently manifest  but he was now resolved entirely to throw off the mask  By his permission the Pope s Nuncio made his public entry into Windsor in his pontificals  preceded by the cross  and attended by a great number of monks in the habit of their respective orders  He next published a declaration for liberty of conscience  by which all restraints upon Popery were taken away  The Church of England took the alarm  the peculiar animosity of the people against the Catholic religion proceeded not less from religious than temporal motives  It is the spirit of that   75 religion to favour arbitrary power  and its reproach to encourage persecution  The English had too osten smarted under both to be willing again to submit to either  Seven Bishops  who had received the King s express orders to cause this declaration of liberty of conscience to be read in their churches  refused to comply  They drew up a modest petition to excuse their refusal  which only served to increase the King s resentment and rage  They were cited before the council  and still adhered to their former resolution with that firmness which is the characteristic of virtue  The Attorney general was ordered to prosecute them for publishing sedition  and abridging the King s prerogative  They were committed prisoners to the Tower  conducted thither amidst the prayers and condolence of an incredible multitude of the populace  who regarded them as sufferers for truth  The day appointed for their tryal arrived  this cause was looked upon as the crisis of English freedom  the council managed the debate on both sides with learning and candour  the jury withdrew into a chamber  where they passed the whole night  but next morning returned into court  and declared the Bishops not guilty  The joy of the people  on this occasion  was inexpressible  the whole city  and the country around  seemed at once to catch the shouts of exultation  they even reached the camp  where the King was then sitting at dinner  who heard them with indignation and amazement   If the Bishops testified the readiness of martyrs  in support of their religion  James shewed no less obstinacy in his attempts towards the establishment of his own  Finding the clergy averse to his designs  he next tried what he could do with the army  He thought  if one regiment would promise implicit obedience  their example would soon induce others to the same compliance  He ordered one of the regiments to be drawn up in his presence  and desired   76 that such as were against his late declaration of liberty should lay down their arms  He was surprized to see the whole battalion ground their arms  except two officers and a few Roman Catholic soldiers   Opposition only served to increase the infatuated Monarch s zeal  he was continually stimulated by his Queen and his priests to proceed rashly onward  But he was particularly urged on by the Jesuit Peters  his confessor  an ambitious and intriguing priest  whom some historians have even accused of being the creature of the Prince of Orange  the King s son in law  who had long since conceived hopes of
