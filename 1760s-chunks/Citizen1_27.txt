 neither startings  strainings  nor attitudes affect me unless there be cause  after I have been once or twice deceived by those unmeaning alarms  my heart sleeps in peace  probably unaffected by the principal distress  There should be one great passion aimed at by the actor as well as the poet  all the rest should be subordinate  and only contribute to make that the greater  if the actor therefore exclaims upon every occasion in the tones of despair  he attempts to move us too soon  he anticipates the blow  he ceases to affect though he gains our applause   I scarce perceived that the audience were almost all departed  wherefore  mixing with the crowd  my companion and I got into the street  where essaying an hundred obstacles from coach wheels and palanquin poles  like birds in their flight through the branches of a forest  after various turnings  we both at length got home in safety   Adieu     83  LETTER XXII  From the same   THE letter which came by the way of Smyrna  and which you sent me unopened  was from my son  As I have permitted you to take copies of all those I send to China  you might have made no ceremony in opening those directed to me  Either in joy or sorrow  my friend should participate in my feelings  It would give pleasure to see a good man pleased at my success  it would give almost equal pleasure to see him sympathise at my disappointment   Every account I receive from the east seems to come loaded with some new affliction  My wife and daughter were taken from me  and yet I sustained the loss with intrepidity  my son is made a slave among barbarians  which was the only blow that could have reached my heart  yes  I will indulge the transports of nature for a little  in order to shew I can overcome them in the end  True magnanimity consists not in NEVER falling  but in RISING every time we fall   When our mighty emperor had published his displeasure at my departure  and seized upon all that was mine  my son was privately secreted from his resentment  Under the protection and guardianship of Fum Hoam  the best and the wisest of all the inhabitants of China  he was for some   84 time instructed in the learning of the missionaries  and the wisdom of the east  But hearing of my adventures  and incited by filial piety  he was resolved to follow my fortunes  and share my distress   He passed the confines of China in disguise  hired himself as a camel driver to a caravan that was crossing the desarts of Thibet  and was within one day s journey of the river Laur  which divides that country from India  when a body of wandering Tartars falling unexpectedly upon the caravan  plundered it  and made those who escaped their first fury slaves  By those he was led into the extensive and desolate regions that border on the shores of the Aral lake   Here he lived by hunting  and was obliged to supply every day a certain proportion of the spoil to regale his savage masters  his learning  his virtues  and even his beauty were qualifications that no way served to recommend him  they knew no merit but that of providing large quantities of milk and raw flesh  and were sensible of no happiness but that of rioting on the undressed meal   Some merchants from Mesched  however  coming to trade with the Tartars  for slaves  he was sold among the number  and led into the kingdom of Persia  where he is now detained  He is there obliged to watch the looks of a voluptuous and cruel master  a man fond of pleasure yet incapable of refinement  whom many years service in war has taught pride  but not bravery   That treasure which I still kept within my bosom  my child  my all that was left to me  is now   85 a slave   Good heavens  why was this  why have I been introduced into this mortal apartment  to be a spectator of my own misfortunes  and the misfortunes of my fellow creatures  wherever I turn  what a labyrinth of doubt  error  and disappointment appears  why was I brought into being  for what purposes made  from whence have I come  whither stray d  or to what regions am I hastening  Reason cannot resolve  It lends a ray to shew the horrors of my prison  but not a light to guide me to escape them  Ye boasted revelations of the earth  how little do you aid the enquiry   How am I surprized at the inconsistency of the magi  their two principles of good and evil affright me  The Indian who bathes his visage in urine  and calls it piety  strikes me with astonishment  The christian who believes in three gods is highly absurd  The Jews who pretend that deity is pleased with the effusion of blood  are not less displeasing  I am equally surprized that rational beings can come from the extremities of the earth  in order to kiss a stone  or scatter pebbles  How contrary to reason are those  and yet all pretend to teach me to be happy   Surely all men are blind
