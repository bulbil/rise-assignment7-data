 that my supposed mortal wound was only a slight scratch  The knowledge of my own safety  disarmed me of a good deal of my resentment  and I began to enquire with some concern into the situation of my antagonist  who remained on the ground bleeding plentifully at his mouth and arm —I helped his footman to raise him  and having bound up his wound with my handkerchief  assured him it was not dangerous  I likewise restored his sword  and offered to support him to his own house —He thanked me  with an air of sullen dignity  and whispering to me  that I should hear from him soon  went away  leaning on his servant s shoulder     I was surprized at this promise  which I construed into a threat  and resolved  if ever he should call me out again  to use whatever advantage fortune might give me over him  in another manner —In the mean time  I had leisure to take notice of Strap  who seemed quite stupified with horror  and  after having recovered him from his exstasy  with an assurance that I had received no damage  to explain the nature of this affair as we walked homeward —By that time I had got into my apartment  I found the wound in my neck stiff and uneasy  and a good deal of clotted blood run down upon my shirt    254 Upon which I pulled off my coat and waistcoat  and unbuttoned my collar  that I might dress it with more ease —My friend no sooner perceived my shirt quite dyed with blood  than imagining I had got at least twenty dreadful wounds  he cried     O Jesus    and fell flat on the floor —I stopt the bleeding with a little dry lint  and applying a plaister over it  cleaned myself from the gore  shifted and dressed  while he lay senseless at my feet  so that when he recovered  and saw me perfectly well  he could scarce believe his own eyes —Now that the danger was past  I was very well pleased with what had happened  which I did not doubt  would soon become known  and consequently dignify my character not a little in this place —I was also proud of having shewn myself  in some shape  worthy of the love of Narcissa  who  I was persuaded  would not think the worse of me for what I had done       255  CHAP  LX    I am visited by Freeman  with whom I appear in public  and am carressed—I am sent for by Lord Quiverwit  whose presence I quit in a passion—Narcissa is carried off by her brother—I intend to pursue him  and am dissuaded by my friend—I engage in play  and lose all my money—set out for London—try my fortune at the gaming table  without success—receive a letter from Narcissa—bilk my taylor   WHILE I entertained myself with these reflections  the news of this duel being communicated by some unknown channel  spread all over the town —I was visited by Freeman  who testified his surprize at finding me  having been told  that Lord Quiverwit being dead of his wounds  I had absconded  in order to avoid the cognizance of the law  I asked if people guessed the occasion of the quarrel  and understanding it was attributed to his lordship s resentment of my reply in the Long room  confirmed that conjecture  glad to find Narcissa unsuspected —My friend  after I had assured him that my antagonist was in no danger  wished me joy of the event  than which  he said  nothing could happen more opportunely to support the idea he had given of my character  to his friends    256 among whom he had been very assiduous in my behalf   On the strength of this assurance  I went with him to the coffee house  where I was saluted by a great many of those very persons  who shunned me the preceeding day —And I found every body making merry with the story of Melinda s French gallant —While I remained in this place  I received a message from Lord Quiverwit  desiring  if I was not engaged  to see me at his house   Thither I immediately repaired  and was conducted to an apartment where I was received by his lordship in bed —Being lest by ourselves  he thanked me in very polite terms  for having used the advantage fortune had given me over him  with such moderation  and asked pardon for any offence his resentment might have prompted him to commit —   I would willingly   said he  make you my friend  but as it is impossible for me to divest myself of my passion for Narcissa  I am too well convinced of your sentiments  to think we shall ever agree on that subject  I took the liberty  therefore  of sending for you  in order to own candidly  that I cannot help opposing your success with that young lady  though at the same time  I promise to regulate my opposition by the dictates of justice and honour  This  however  I think proper to advertise you of  that she has no independant fortune  and if you should even succeed in your addresses  you would have the mortification to see her reduced to indigence  unless you have
