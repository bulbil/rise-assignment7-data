earth for what had happened  he said  there was a lady in the world to whom he was bound to offer his hand  that her brother was his particular friend  that his marriage was then actually negotiating  and he was pressed on that occasion to return to London  He owned he    had never seen the lady  but as his honour was engaged to her brother  he could not look upon himself as a free man  He cursed his ill fate  that he had not had an opportunity of informing me of this sooner  which  he said  might have prevented me from casting away my affection on a man  who could not deserve it  What could I say  madam  There was no room for reproaches or complaints  I made none  I had nobody to accuse but myself  I had declared my frantic love to Mr Faulkland unasked  I had implored his in return  in one dreadful moment I fell a sacrifice to my own weakness  The only hope that now remained for me  was built on that circumstance of Mr Faulkland’s having never seen his destined bride  Had I known you  madam  to have been the person  there could have sprung but small comfort from that consideration  but ignorant as I was of the lady’s merit  I thought it not impossible but that some objection might have arisen either to her person or temper  or the lady  perhaps   though that I thought almost incredible  might not approve of Mr Faulkland  in either case  some glimmerings of hope remained for me  Mr Faulkland’s generous compassion for me  gave me room to think he did not hate me  and I was unwilling to lose the little interest I thought I had gained in his heart  by fond complainings  much less upbraidings  for which he had given me no cause  I therefore acquiesced  determined to wait for what my fate was to do with me  resolving privately in my own mind  that in case Mr Faulkland’s intended nuptials should not take place  to remind him of my love  I did not confess to my aunt what had been the result of that interview  which she had contrived between Mr Faulkland and me  shame would not suffer me to indulge it  But it was not long in my power to conceal it  I believe indeed  she suspected it before  She reproached me for the error which she herself had caused  but I believe  what most nettled her was Mr Faulkland’s having escaped the snare  for I am sure she would have been base enough to have had me retain him as a lover  though I could not secure him for a husband  for he was not the first  that this bad woman would have seduced me to favour  for her own private interest   In the midst of the horror  into which the condition I found myself threw me  I heard that Mr Faulkland was on the point of being married   The prospect I had before me drove me to despair  I knew I could not remain long in my uncle’s house  I knew not whither to fly  In my distraction I wrote to Mr Faulkland  You  madam  saw the letter  that    ill fated letter  which deprived Mr Faulkland of his happiness   I soon received an answer  wherein Mr Faulkland related to me at large the unfortunate consequences that letter had produced  He lamented  in the tenderest manner  my unhappy situation  told me  he would provide me a proper place for my retreat  and  as I was an entire stranger in London  having never been there  would recommend me to the notice of one of the best of women  lady Bidulph  from whom  as my unhappy story was known to her  I might expect the utmost humanity  And here  madam  with blushes let me own it  he urged me not to conceal a single circumstance of the truth from that lady   ‘You know  said he  my dear Miss Burchell  I am not a seducer  rescue me from that black suspicion  and  as far as the unhappy case will admit  clear my honour to lady Bidulph  See what a reliance I have on your honour  when I trust the vindicating of my own to you  in such delicate circumstances  He concluded his letter with telling me frankly  that though he had been rejected by Miss Bidulph  he loved her with such an ardent passion  that it was impossible for him ever to think of any other woman  and till he had a heart to bestow  he should never entertain a thought of marriage ’  You know Mr Faulkland at this juncture went abroad  and thus was I circumstanced when I came to that house  which he had provided for me  And so frank and noble were his proceedings  that I solemnly declare  I was determined  though at the hazard of divulging my own shame  to have acquitted him to the utmost of my power to lady Bidulph  and should have rejoiced  could I have been the means of procuring him the happiness he deserved  in regaining your favour  as I had been  though unknowingly  the unlucky cause of his losing it  But
