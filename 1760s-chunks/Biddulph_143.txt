time has not been spent in vain  But for these last fourteen days  had I kept a journal for my cat  I think I should have had as much to say for her   July 8  I shall grow busy again  I have received the promised letter from Sir George  an extraordinary one it is  but I will not anticipate the contents  read them yourself   Dear Sidney July 4  1706   I have a serious subject to offer to your consideration  which made me the rather chuse to engage your attention in this manner  than in a conversation between ourselves  liable as that would be to interruptions  objections  and frivolous punctilios  from which you have already suffered so severely   I have paid so much regard to that decorum of which you are so fond  as never to have mentioned Mr Faulkland’s name to you since you were become a widow  though it is near four months since he returned to England   As I kept up a correspondence with him when he was abroad  you may be sure I informed him of your reconciliation to your late husband  a reconciliation  which  if you thought it a happiness to you  you were indebted to Faulkland for  This single circumstance it was that inclined him to return to England  which otherwise perhaps he would never again have seen  though the necessity of his affairs here  which he had left at random  required his presence  To avoid giving umbrage to your husband  he repaired privately to his house in the country  where I paid him a visit  Few of his friends  except myself  knew of his being in the kingdom     Remember  Sidney  the great obligations you have to Mr Faulkland  and let that prepare your mind for what I am going to say   You are now become a free woman  Faulkland loves you still  with an unparallel’d affection  I had a letter from him soon after your arrival in town  wherein he mentions the revival of his hopes from your present situation  and intreats me to be mindful of his interest  He charged me  however  not to mention his name to you  till a decent time was passed  otherwise probably you would have been acquainted with these particulars sooner  but Faulkland himself has a little too much of that ridiculous nicety which you admire so  I think I have waited till a very decent time  as you have now been almost three months a widow   I have very little reason to imagine that my influence  on this occasion  will have any weight either with you or my mother  I have had proofs of this already  but I hope you will not be so blind to your own interest  as to refuse the good that fortune once more throws at your feet  I can hardly suppose you so weak  as to let the absurd objection  which formerly prevented your happiness  still prevail with you to reject the same happiness  so unexpectedly again offered to your acceptance   My mother and you have by this time learnt how to forgive human frailties  Indeed you forgave such enormities  that Faulkland’s transgression  in comparison of them  was innocence  But I will not reproach the memory of the dead   Whatever pretence you might formerly have had to carry your punctilios to an extraordinary height  certain circumstances in your life have now made your situation very different  You are destitute of fortune  incumbered with children  Reflect on this  and let your own imagination supply the rest  To any body but yourself  I should think all that I have said needless  but I know the minds that I have to deal with   I must take this opportunity of telling you  that I am surprized at my mother’s continued attachment to Miss Burchell  she is an artful creature  and  I think  by no means a proper acquaintance for you  I am far from wishing to injure her  but such an intimacy may be dangerous   You will certainly hear from Faulkland before it be long  I repeat it again  You owe him more than ever you will be able to    repay  the recompence he deserves will ensure your own happiness and prosperity  your gratitude  as well as your prudence  will now be put to the test  and your conduct  on this occasion  will determine me as to the light in which I shall henceforth consider you   Present my duty to my mother  Lady Sarah desires her service may be accepted   I am   c   What a letter is this  my sister  But Sir George is still himself  gross  void of sentiment  he dreams of nothing but the glaring advantages that fortune and rank in life procure  And how he argues too  Weak arguer  He will not suppose that the objection  absurd he calls it   which formerly prevented my happiness  should still prevail with me to reject the same happiness—Why not  Is the nature of Mr Faulkland’s offence changed  Has he ever repaired it  Has not Miss Burchell the same claim she ever had  Nay  a stronger than ever  if years of unabated love can give it her  My mother and I have
