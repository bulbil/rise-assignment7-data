of extraordinary stature  others for producing some particular animals in great abundance  some for excessive plenty  and others again for seemingly causeless famine  Nature which shews herself so very different in her visible productions  must surely differ also from herself in the production of minds  and while she astonishes one age with the strength and stature of a Milo or a Maximin  may bless another with the wisdom of a Plato  or the goodness of an Antonine     278Let us not then attribute to accident the falling off of every nation  but to the natural revolution of things  Often in the darkest ages there has appeared some one man of surprizing abilities  who  with all his understanding  failed to bring his barbarous age into refinement  all mankind seemed to sleep  till nature gave the general call  and then the whole world seemed at once rouzed at the voice  science triumphed in every country  and the brightness of a single genius seemed lost in a galaxy of contiguous glory   Thus the enlightened periods in every age have been universal  At the time when China first began to emerge from barbarity  the western world was equally rising into refinement  when we had our Yau  they had their Sesostris  In succeeding ages  Confucius and Pythagoras seem born nearly together  and a train of philosophers then sprung up as well in Greece as in China  The period of renewed barbarity begun to have an universal spread much about the same time  and continued for several centuries  till in the year of the christian aera 1400  the emperor Yonglo arose  to revive the learning of the east  while about the same time the Medicean family laboured in Italy to raise infant genius from the cradle  thus we see politeness spreading over every part of the world in one age  and barbarity succeeding in another  at one period a blaze of light diffusing itself over the whole world  and at another all mankind wrapped up in the profoundest ignorance   Such has been the situation of things in times past  and such probably it will ever be  China  I have observed  has evidently begun to degenerate from its former politeness  and were the learning of the Europeans at present candidly considered    279 the decline would perhaps appear to have already taken place  We should find among the natives of the west the study of morality displaced for mathematical disquisition  or metaphysical subtelties  we should find learning begin to separate from the useful duties and concerns of life  while none ventured to aspire after that character  but they who know much more than is truly amusing or useful  We should find every great attempt suppressed by prudence  and the rapturous sublimity in writing cooled by a cautious fear of offence  We should find few of those daring spirits  who bravely venture to be wrong  and who are willing to hazard much for the sake of great acquisitions  Providence has indulged the world with a period of almost four hundred years refinement  does it not now by decrees sink us into our former ignorance  leaving us only the love of wisdom  while it deprives us of its advantages  Adieu   LETTER LXI  From the same   THE princes of Europe have found out a manner of rewarding their subjects who have behaved well  by presenting them with about two yards of blue ribbon  which is worn about the shoulder  They who are honoured with this mark of distinction are called knights  and the King himself is always the head of the order  This is a very frugal method of recompensing the most important services  and it is very fortunate for kings that their subjects are satisfied with   280 such trifling rewards  Should a nobleman happen to lose his leg in battle  the King presents him with two yards of ribbon  and he is paid for the loss of his limb  Should an embassador spend all his paternal fortune in supporting the honour of his country abroad  the King presents him with two yards of ribbon  which is to be considered as an equivalent to his estate  In short  while an European King has a yard of blue or green ribbon left  he need be under no apprehensions of wanting statesmen  generals  and soldiers   I cannot sufficiently admire those Kingdoms in which men with large patrimonial estates are willing thus to undergo real hardships for empty favours  A person  already possessed of a competent fortune  who undertakes to enter the career of ambition  feels many real inconveniencies from his station  while it procures him no real happiness that he was not possessed of before  He could eat  drink  and sleep  before he became a courtier  as well  perhaps better than when invested with his authority  He could command flatterers in a private station  as well as in his public capacity  and indulge at home every favourite inclination  uncensured and unseen by the people   What real good then does an addition to a fortune already sufficient procure  Not any  Could the great man by having his fortune encreased  encrease also his appetites  then precedence might be attended with real amusement   Was he by having his one thousand made two  thus enabled to enjoy two wives  or eat two dinners    281 then indeed he might be excused for undergoing
