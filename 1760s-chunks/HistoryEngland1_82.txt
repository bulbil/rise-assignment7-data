size  while her wit and vivacity even exceeded the allurements of her person  The King  who never restrained one passion which he   240 desired to gratify  saw  and loved her  but  after several efforts to induce her to comply with his criminal passion  he found that without marriage he could have no hopes of succeeding  This obstacle  therefore  he quickly undertook to remove  his own Queen was now become hateful to him  and  in order to procure a divorce  he pretended that his conscience rebuked him  for having so long lived in incest with his present Queen  formerly his brother s wife  This every person of candour saw was only a pretext to cover his real motive  he himself had eagerly solicited the match with Queen Catharine  he had lived with her eighteen years without any scruple  and had the Pope s licence for this cohabitation  but he asserted  that a wounded conscience was his motive  and none of his subjects offered to divulge the real one   In this perplexity  therefore  he applied to Clement VII  who owed him obligations  and from whom he expected a ready compliance  to dissolve the bull of the former Pope  who had given him permission to marry Catharine  and to declare that it was contrary to all laws  both divine and human  Clement was now in the utmost perplexity  Queen Catharine was aunt to the Emperor who had lately made him a prisoner  and whose resentment he dreaded to rekindle  by thus injuring so near a relation  beside  he could not  in honour  declare the bull of a former Pope illicit  for this would be entirely destroying papal infallibility  On the other hand  Henry was his protector and friend  the dominions of England were the chief resource of his finances  and the King of France  some time before  had got a bull of divorce in somewhat similar circumstances  In this exigence he thought the best method was to spin out the affair by a negotiation    241 and thus he argued  temporized  promised  recanted  and disputed  hoping that the King s passion would never hold out during the tedious course of an ecclesiastical controversy  In this he was mistaken  Henry had been taught to argue as well as he  and quickly found  or wrested  many texts of scripture to favour his opinions and his passion  To his arguments he added threats  which probably had greater influence  the Pope was assured that the English were already but too much disposed to withdraw their obedience from the Holy See  and that  if he continued to refuse  the whole country would readily follow their Monarch s example  and exclude themselves from his protection  The King even proposed to his Holiness  whether  if he was denied the putting away his present Queen  he might not have a dispensation to marry two wives at a time  The Pope  though his measures were already taken not to grant the bull  yet still seemed unresolved  as if waiting for more full and authentic information   During these solicitations  on which Henry s happiness seemed to depend  he expected  in his favourite Wolsey  a warm defender and a steady adherent  but  in this  he was deceived  Wolsey seemed to be in pretty much such a dilemma as the Pope himself  On the one hand he was to please his master the King  from whom he had received a thousand marks of favour  on the other hand he could not disoblige the Pope  whose servant he more immediately was  and who had power to punish his disobedience  in this dilemma he chose to stand neuter  though  of all mankind  he was most haughty  on this occasion he gave way in all things  to his colleague Cardinal Campegio  sent by the Pope from Italy  Wolsey s   242 method of temporizing highly disgusted the King  yet he endeavoured to conceal his resentment  he now only looked out for some man of equal abilities and less art  and it was not long till accident threw in his way one Thomas Cranmer  of greater abilities than the former  and rather more integrity  Cranmer was a Doctor of Divinity and a Professor at Cambridge  but had lost his place upon marrying contrary to the institutes of the canon law  which enjoined him celibacy  He had travelled into Germany  where he read Luther s works  and embraced his doctrine  and  upon his return  was tutor to the sons of a gentleman  who one night happened to entertain two of the principal men of the court  Cranmer  being asked his opinion of the King s divorce  which was then the topic of the conversation  delivered himself in so learned a manner  that the King was soon informed of his abilities  and ordered him to follow the court   The King s resentment now appeared more openly against the Cardinal  The Attorney general was ordered to prepare a bill of indictment against him  and soon after he himself was orderdered to resign the great seal  Crimes are readily found against a man when he is hated  and the Cardinal was sentenced to be excluded from the protection of the laws  As soon as he was outlawed  the King commanded him to retire to
