have been perhaps a great while before he could have found words   which he would have thought proper for the purpose  if he had not taken   an opportunity  which  without any design of his own  offered itself   to him       The chevalier St  George took a particular pleasure in the game of   Chess  and Horatio having learned it among the officers in Campaine    frequently played with him  they were one evening at this diversion    when the lover of Charlotta having his mind a little perplexed  placed   his men so ill  that the chevalier beat him out at every motion  How is   this  Horatio  cried he  you used to play better than I  butt now I have   the advantage of you   May you always have it  sir  replied he with the   utmost respect  over all who pretend to oppose you   Chess is a kind of   emblem of war  where policy should go hand in hand with courage  and   there is a great master in that art  whom if I were some time to serve   under  I flatter myself that I should be able to know how to move my men   with better success than I have done to night  but then my skill should   be employed only against such as are your enemies       You mean my brother Charles of Sweden  said the chevalier smiling  but I   believe he seldom plays  Never  but when kingdoms are at stake  resumed   Horatio  and if a day should come when you  sir  shall attempt the   prize  how fortunate would it be for me to have learned to serve you as   I am obliged by much more than my duty  by the most natural and   inviolable attachment of my heart  which would render it the greatest   blessing I could receive from heaven  I believe  indeed  returned the   chevalier St  George  you love me enough to fight in my cause whenever   occasion offers  I would not only fight  but die  cried Horatio warmly    yet I would wish to have the skill to make a great number of your   enemies die before me  Well  said the chevalier  we will talk of this   to morrow  in the mean time play as well as you can against me at St    Germains  in another place perhaps you may play for me  Horatio made no   other reply to these words than a low bow  and then elating his hands   and eyes to heaven  as internally praying for the opportunity his master   seemed to hint at       The impression this little conversation made on the mind of the   chevalier St  George  proved itself in its effects the very next day    Horatio being ordered to come into his chamber early in the morning   I   have been thinking on what passed last night between us  said he  and if   you have a serious Intention of doing what you seemed to hint at  will   contribute all I can to forward you       Ah sir  cried Horatio  falling at his feet  impute not  I beseech you    this desire in me to any thing but the extreme desire I have to render   myself worthy of the favours you have been pleased to confer upon me    and to be able to serve you whenever any happy occasion shall   present itself       No more  Horatio  replied the chevalier  with a sweetness and affability   peculiar to himself  I am perfectly assured of your duty and affection   to me  and am so far from taking it ill that you desire to quit my court   on this score  that I think  your ambition highly laudable   I will   write letters of recommendation  with my own hand  to my brother   Charles  and to some others in his camp  which I doubt not but will   procure you a reception answerable to your wishes   therefore  as it is   a long journey you are to take  the sooner you provide for your   departure the better   I will order you out of my privy purse 2000   crowns towards your expences       Horatio found it impossible to express how much this goodness touched   his soul  nor could do it any otherwise than by prostrating himself a   second time  embracing his knees  and uttering some incoherent   acclamations  which more shewed to his master the sincerity of his   gratitude  and the perfect love he bore him  than the most elegant   speeches could have done       After all possible demonstrations of the most gracious benignity on the   one side  and reverence on the other  Horatio quitted the presence  and   went to sir Thomas Higgons  who at that
