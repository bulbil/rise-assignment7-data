Gentle  who   sacrificed his fine sense and affluent fortune to the vanity and   bad temper of a silly and turbulent wife   and Squire Sulky  a   brutal fool  who tyrannized over the most sensible and most ami    able of her sex      On the opposite side was Lord Prim  who evidently laboured   hard to be easy in conversation   and next to him was Lord   Flippant  who spoke nonsense with great facility  By his side   sat the fair but dejected Miss Willow   she had lately discovered   what a misfortune it was to be born to wit  beauty  and affluence    the three capital qualifications that lead the sex to calamity  Next   to her was Colonel Jolly  with a heart ever tuned to merriment    and lungs to laughter  Had he known how to time his fits  the   laugh might have grown catching  Below him was seated Mrs    Mirror  a widow lady  industriously accomplished in the faults of   people of fashion  And below her sat the beloved and respected   Mr  Meekly  who always sought to hide behind the merits of the   company  Next to him was Major Settle no one spoke with more   importance on things of no signification  And beside him sat Miss   Lovely  who looked sentiment  and  while she was silent  inspired   others with sense and virtue      These were the principal characters  The rest could not be said   to be of any character at all  The cloth had been lately removed    and a host of glasses and decanters glowed on the table  when in   comes young Harry  escorted by his nurse      All the eyes of the company were instantly drawn upon him    but he advanced  with a vacant and unobserving physiognomy  and   thought no higher of the assembly than as of so many peasants   at a country wake      Dicky  my dear  says my lady  go and welcome your brother    whereat Dick went up  took Harry by the hand  and kissed him   with much affection  Harry  thereupon  having eyed his brother   I don t know you  said he  bluntly  but at the same time held up   his little mouth to kiss him again      Dick  says my lady  put your laced hat upon Harry  that we may   see how it becomes him  which he immediately did  but Harry    feeling an unusual encumbrance on his head  took off the hat  and    having for some time looked contemptuously at it  he cast it from   him with a sudden and agile jerk  as he used to cast flat stones   to make ducks and drakes in the mill pond  The hat took the   glasses and decanters in full career   smash go the glasses  abroad   pours the wine on circling laces  Dresden aprons  silvered silks    and rich brocades   female screams filled the parlour   the rout is   equal to the uproar   and it was long ere most of them could be   composed to their places      B2         4 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      In the meanwhile  Harry took no kind of interest in their out    cries or distresses   but spying a larsre Spanish pointer  that just   then came from under the table  he sprung at him like lightning    seized him by the collar  and vaulted on his back with inconceivable   agility  The dog  wholly disconcerted by so unaccustomed a bur    den  capered and plunged about in a violent manner   but Harry   was a better horseman than to be so easily dismounted   whereon   the dog grew outrageous  and  rushing into a group of little misses   and masters  the children of the visitants  he overthrew them like   nine pins  thence proceeding with equal rapidity between the   legs of Mrs  Dowdy  a very fat and elderly lady  she instantly fell   back with a violent shriek  and  in her fall  unfortunately overthrew   Frank the foxhunter  who overthrew Andrew the angler  who over    threw Bob the beau  who closed the catastrophe      Our hero  meantime  was happily dismounted by the intercepting   petticoats  and fairly laid  without damage  in the fallen lady s   lap  From thence he arose at his leisure  and strolled about the   room with as unconcerned an aspect as if nothing had happened   amiss  and as though he had neither art nor part in this frightful   discomfiture      When matters were once more  in some measure  set to rights   My heavens   exclaimed my lady  I shall faint
