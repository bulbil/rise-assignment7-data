their voices  in a most lamentable strain   begged  for the passion of Christ  that he would spare their lives  and  take all they had   Peregrine guessing  from this exclamation  and the circumstance of their  being abed  that they mistook him for a robber  and were ignorant of  that which he wanted to know  dispelled their terror  by making them  acquainted with the cause of his visit  and desired the husband to get  up with all possible despatch  in order to assist and attend him in his  search   Thus reinforced  he rummaged every corner of the inn  and at last   finding the hostler in the stable  was by him informed  to his  unspeakable mortification  that the gentleman and lady who arrived in  the chaise  had immediately hired post horses for a certain village  at the distance of fifteen miles  and departed without halting for the  least refreshment  Our adventurer  mad with his disappointment  mounted  his horse in an instant  and  with his attendant  took the same road   with full determination to die  rather than desist from the prosecution  of his design  He had  by this time  rode upwards of thirty miles  since  three o clock in the afternoon  so that the horses were almost quite  jaded  and travelled this stage so slowly  that it was morning before  they reached the place of their destination  where  far from finding the  fugitives  he understood that no such persons as he described had passed  that way  and that  in all likelihood  they had taken a quite contrary  direction  while in order to mislead him in his pursuit  they had amused  the hostler with a false route  This conjecture was strengthened by his  perceiving  now for the first time  that he had deviated a considerable  way from the road  through which they must have journeyed  in order to  arrive at the place of her mother s residence  and these suggestions  utterly deprived him of the small remains of recollection which he  had hitherto retained  His eyes rolled about  witnessing rage and  distraction  he foamed at the mouth  stamped upon the ground with  great violence  uttered incoherent imprecations against himself and all  mankind  and would have sallied forth again  he knew not whither  upon  the same horse  which he had already almost killed with fatigue  had  not his confidant found means to quiet the tumult of his thoughts   and recall his reflection  by representing the condition of the poor    6 22 15  3 45 PM   animals  and advising him to hire fresh horses  and ride post across  the country  to the village in the neighbourhood of Mrs  Gauntlet s  habitation  where they should infallibly intercept the daughter   provided they could get the start of her upon the road   Peregrine not only relished  but forthwith acted in conformity with  this good counsel  His own horses were committed to the charge of the  landlord  with directions for Pipes  in case he should come in quest of  his master  and  a couple of stout geldings being prepared  he and  his valet took the road again  steering their course according to the  motions of the post boy  who undertook to be their guide  They had  almost finished the first stage  when they descried a post chaise just  halting at the inn where they proposed to change horses  upon which our  adventurer  glowing with a most interesting presage  put his beast  to the full speed  and approached near enough to distinguish  as the  travellers quitted the carriage  that he had at last come up with the  very individual persons whom he had pursued so long   Flushed with this discovery  he galloped into the yard so suddenly  that  the lady and her conductor scarce had time to shut themselves up in a  chamber  to which they retreated with great precipitation  so that  the pursuer was now certain of having housed his prey  That he might   however  leave nothing to fortune  he placed himself upon the stair by  which they had ascended to the apartment  and sent up his compliments to  the young lady  desiring the favour of being admitted to her presence   otherwise he should be obliged to waive all ceremony  and take that  liberty which she would not give  The servant  having conveyed his  message through the keyhole  returned with an answer  importing that she  would adhere to the resolution she had taken  and perish  rather than  comply with his will  Our adventurer  without staying to make any  rejoinder to this reply  ran upstairs  and  thundering at the door  for entrance  was given to understand by the nymph s attendant  that  a blunderbuss was ready primed for his reception  and that he would do  well to spare him the necessity of shedding blood in defence of a person  who had put herself under his protection   All the laws of the land    said he   cannot now untie
