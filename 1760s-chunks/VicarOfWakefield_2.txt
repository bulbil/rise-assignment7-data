usually in three or four days we began to wonder how they vext us   My children  the offspring of temperance  as they were educated without softness   Page  5  so they were at once well formed and healthy  my sons hardy and active  my daughters dutiful and blooming  When I stood in the midst of the little circle  which promised to be the supports of my declining age  I could not avoid repeating the famous story of Count Abensberg  who  in Henry II s progress through Germany  when other courtiers came with their treasures  brought his thirty two children  and presented them to his sovereign as the most valuable offering he had to bestow  In this manner  though I had but six  I considered them as a very valuable present made to my country  and consequently looked upon it as my debtor  Our eldest son was named George  after his uncle  who left us ten thousand pounds  Our second child  a girl  I intended to call after her aunt Grissel  but my wife  who during her pregnancy had been reading romances  insisted upon her being called Olivia  In less than another year we had a daughter again  and now I was determined that Grissel should be her name  but a rich relation  Page  6  taking a fancy to stand godmother  the girl was  by her directions  called Sophia  so that we had two romantic names in the family  but I solemnly protest I had no hand in it  Moses was our next  and after an interval of twelve years  we had two sons more   It would be fruitless to deny my exultation when I saw my little ones about me  but the vanity and the satisfaction of my wife were even greater than mine  When our visitors would usually say    Well  upon my word  Mrs  Primrose  you have the finest children in the whole country    —   Ay  neighbour    she would answer    they are as heaven made them  handsome enough  if they be good enough  for handsome is that handsome does    And then she would bid the girls hold up their heads  who  to conceal nothing  were certainly very handsome  Mere outside is so very trifling a circumstance with me  that I should scarce have remembered to mention it  had it not  Page  7  been a general topic of conversation in the country  Olivia  now about eighteen  had that luxuriancy of beauty with which painters generally draw Hebe  open  sprightly  and commanding  Sophia s features were not so striking at first  but often did more certain execution  for they were soft  modest  and alluring  The one vanquished by a single blow  the other by efforts successfully repeated     The temper of a woman is generally formed from the turn of her features  at least it was so with my daughters  Olivia wished for many lovers  Sophia to secure one  Olivia was often affected from too great a desire to please  Sophia even represt excellence from her fears to offend  The one entertained me with her vivacity when I was gay  the other with her sense when I was serious  But these qualities were never carried to excess in either  and I have often seen them exchange characters for a whole day together  A suit of mourning has transformed my coquet into  Page  8  a prude  and a new set of ribbands given her younger sister more than natural vivacity  My eldest son George was bred at Oxford  as I intended him for one of the learned professions  My second boy Moses  whom I designed for business  received a sort of a miscellaneous education at home  But it would be needless to attempt describing the particular characters of young people that had seen but very little of the world  In short  a family likeness prevailed through all  and properly speaking  they had but one character  that of being all equally generous  credulous  simple  and inoffensive   Page   unnumbered   CHAP  II   Family misfortunes  The loss of fortune only serves to encrease the pride of the worthy   THE temporal concerns of our family were chiefly committed to my wife s management  as to the spiritual I took them entirely under my own direction  The profits of my living  which amounted to but thirty five pounds a year  I gave to the orphans and widows of the clergy of our diocese  for having a sufficient fortune of my own  I was careless of temporalities  and felt a secret pleasure in doing my duty without reward  I also set a resolution of keeping no curate  and of being acquainted with every man in the parish  exhorting the married men to temperance and the bachelors to matrimony  so that in a few years it was a common saying  that there  Page  10  were three strange wants at Wakefield  a parson wanting pride  young men wanting wives  and ale houses wanting customers   Matrimony was always one of my favourite topics  and I wrote several sermons to prove its utility and happiness  but there was a peculiar tenet which I made a point of supporting
