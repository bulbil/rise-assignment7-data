 nor was his  perplexity dissipated by the conclusion of this speech  The accounts  which he had received from Oswald seemed natural and consistent  those  of Grey subtile and improbable  and  yet  this ring was such an  attestation of his truth and integrity  as seemed to warrant a full  assent  He wavered for a while  but endeavoured to persuade himself that  the orders which Grey delivered were real  and demanded his compliance   timorous by nature  and possessed with strong imaginations of the power  of Raymond  and the danger of his displeasure  He therefore laboured to  suppress all his doubts  affected to be fully convinced and satisfied   and consented to deliver up young William to be conducted back to his  mother by the Monk and Grey  who dissembled their joy  and studied to  compleat their success  by seducing Oswald from his retreat  They  exerted all their artifice to persuade him that the resentment of his  Lord had totally subsided  that he could not but consent to the desires  of  the gentle Countess  and forgive an honest though mistaken zeal for the  service of a Lady  who in a few days was to be united with him  in the  bands of love and wedlock  Oswald hesitated  he knew the falsehood of  some part of what Grey had declared  yet he conceived that he must have  delivered this jewel from the hand of the Countess  and by her command   and that  of consequence  she must have been reconciled to her suitor   He thought it natural  on such a reconciliation  to conceal some late  transactions  thus he endeavoured to account for the misrepresentations  of Grey  yet still he feared and doubted —Grey  as by the authority of  his Lord  and in his name  not only pronounced his full pardon  but  assured him of favour and reward  The Abbot condemned his irresolution  as weak and criminal  as highly prejudicial to his own interest  and an  undutiful suspicion of the truth and honour of his master  The  simplicity and inexperience of the vassal gave force to these  sollicitations  he dreaded to renew the displeasure of Raymond by  delay or hesitation  he consented to return  and resigned himself to  Grey  who now led away his victims in triumph     The party which Grey had appointed to attend him  soon appeared in view   obeyed his signal  and advanced  At the sight of armed men  the  misguided Oswald felt all his suspicions renewed  he trembled  and his  fears were instantly confirmed  Grey  with an air of sullen authority   ordered him to be seized and bound  he attempted to expostulate  but was  silenced with all the insolence of a successful malice  committed to a  guard  and led away a prisoner to the castle  and  there  was this  friend to the afflicted and oppressed consigned to the dreary dungeon   The infant heir of Salisbury was entrusted to others of the party  whose  services Grey purchased by rich bribes  and in whom he chiefly confided   A kinsman he had upon the distant coast of Devon  to whom they were  directed to convey their charge with strictest care  Thus he resolved to  dispose of the young Lord for the present  as he relied on the  attachment of this kinsman  and  by his means might hereafter remove him to some safe and secret  residence  as his future purposes might require                  SECT  III     THUS far the wicked arts of Grey had been compleatly successful  and   now  he hastened to the presence of Lord Raymond with his flattering  congratulations  He acquainted him in a few words  that all the mischief  which the flight of Oswald had threatened was now effectually prevented   that he had safely disposed of young William with such guardians as  were devoted to his  and to his master s service  and that the false  slave who had attempted to betray him  was now his prisoner  Raymond  wondered  embraced his minion  and applauded his address and  vigilance  In his first violence of pride and resentment he pronounced  that Oswald should instantly be hanged upon the next tree  But Grey  restrained his passion  and entreated him to suspend the fate of this  vassal  and to reserve the power of granting his forfeited life to the  requests of Ela  if this might hereafter contribute to conciliate her  regards  At the name of Ela  Raymond fighed  and turned upon his  creature  with an aspect of perplexity and sorrow   Trust me   said he         I am weary of this unprofitable pursuit  and would to heaven I had  never seen this proud dame  never felt the power of her beauty  —This  morning was I unexpectedly summoned to her presence  I saw the charming  mourner  I saw her tortured with fears  She had just discovered the  loss of an ancient ring  the usual ornament of her hand
