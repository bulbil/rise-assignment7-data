of your conversation  in relation to me  which I should have resented   more than I do  but that I am conscious I had no business to demean   myself so as to be in your closet  where I might have expected to hear a   multitude of impertinence between you       Well  sir  said she  you have no objection  I hope  to Pamela s going   away on Thursday next  You are mighty solicitous  said he  about Pamela    But no  not I  let her go as soon as she will  She is a naughty girl    and has brought all this upon herself  and upon me more trouble than she   can have had from me  But I have overcome it all  and will never concern   myself about her       I have a proposal made me  added he  since I have been out this morning    that I shall go near to embrace  and so wish only  that a discreet use   may be made of what is past  and there s an end of every thing with me    as to Pamela  I ll assure you  I clasped my hands together through my   apron  overjoyed at this  though I was soon to go away  For  naughty as   he has been to me  I wish his prosperity with all my heart  for my good   old lady s sake  Well  Pamela  said he  you need not now be afraid to   speak to me  tell me what you lifted up your hands at  I said not a   word  Says he  If you like what I have said  give me your hand upon it    I held my hand up through my apron  for I could not speak to him  and he   took hold of it  and pressed it  though less hard than he did my arm the   day before  What does the little fool cover her face for  said he  Pull   your apron away  and let me see how you look  after your freedom of   speech of me last night  No wonder you are ashamed to see me  You know   you were very free with my character       I could not stand this barbarous insult  as I took it to be  considering   his behaviour to me  and I then spoke and said  O the difference between   the minds of thy creatures  good God  How shall some be cast down in   their innocence  while others can triumph in their guilt       And so saying  I went up stairs to my chamber  and wrote all this  for   though he vexed me at his taunting  yet I was pleased to hear he was   likely to be married  and that his wicked intentions were so happily   overcome as to me  and this made me a little easier  And I hope I have   passed the worst  or else it is very hard  And yet I shan t think   myself at ease quite  till I am with you  For  methinks  after all    his repentance and amendment are mighty suddenly resolved upon  But the   divine grace is not confined to space  and remorse may  and I hope has    smitten him to the heart at once  for his injuries to poor me  Yet I   won t be too secure neither       Having opportunity  I send now what I know will grieve you to the heart    But I hope I shall bring my next scribble myself  and so conclude    though half broken hearted  Your ever dutiful DAUGHTER                LETTER XXVII         DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER       I am glad I desired you not to meet me  and John says you won t  for   he told you he is sure I shall get a passage well enough  either behind   some one of my fellow servants on horseback  or by farmer Nichols s   means  but as to the chariot he talked to you of  I can t expect that   favour  to be sure  and I should not care for it  because it would look   so much above me  But farmer Brady  they say  has a chaise with one   horse  and we hope to borrow that  or hire it  rather than fail  though   money runs a little lowish  after what I have laid out  but I don t   care to say so here  though I warrant I might have what I would of Mrs    Jervis  or Mr  Jonathan  or Mr  Longman  but then how shall I pay it    you ll say  And  besides  I don t love to be beholden
