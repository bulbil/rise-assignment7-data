what passed yesterday  Sir Charles is gone to Grosvenor Square  to enquire after the health and composure of his noble guests there   When I called upon Lady Clementina yesterday  five o clock  I found her greatly distressed with her   179 own apprehensions  I must  said she to me  be a guiltier creature than I had allowed myself to think I was  Why else am I so ashamed  so afraid  to see parents whom I ever honoured  brothers and friends whom I ever loved —O Lady Grandison  What a dispiriting thing is the consciousness of having done amiss  And to a proud heart too   Then looking upon the written plan  Let me see  said she  what I am to sign  These were the remarks she made upon them  as she read    1   Hard  hard article  the first  But your Grandison  madam  my fourth brother  my friend  my protector  tells me  that I shall discharge all the obligations he ever laid upon me  if I will sign it —I submit    2   How flattering to my pride  to my hopes of doing good to the indigent and unhappy    3   Nominating my attendants—my confessor—Kind  considerate Grandison  If I give up the first wish of my heart  I shall not insist upon these stipulations in my favour  My parents shall have  in these cases  affirmative and negative too  Indeed I desire not in any article to be independent of them    4   A grateful article  I acknowlege  Chevalier  your protection with gratitude  in this stipulation    5   If my friends promise  they will perform  Ours is a family of untainted honour  I hope my Brother Giacomo will be answered for by his Brothers in these articles  But he will hate me  I fear   Generous Grandison  what tempting proposals do you conclude with  And you  Lady Grandison  are so good as to say  that my happiness is wanting to complete yours—That is a motive  I assure you  Lead me  madam  and do you  my dear Lady L   my hospitable other protectress  oblige me with your countenance too  A woman of your honour and goodness  Sister of the Chevalier Grandison  acknowleging me your guest  and answering for my behaviour    180 will credit the abject Clementina in the eyes of her forgiving relations —Sir Charles Grandison there before me  to prepare them to receive graciously the fugitive —Lead me on  while I can be led  I will attend you   She looked wild and disordered  and  giving each of us a hand  we led her to the coach  But  at stepping in  she trembled  faltered  and seemed greatly disturbed  We consoled her all we could  and the coach drove to Grosvenor Square  When it stopt  she threw her arms about Lady L  and  hiding her face in her bosom  called upon the Blessed Virgin to support her—How  how  said she  can I look my Father  my Mother  in the face   Sir Charles  on the coach stopping  appeared  He saw her emotion  It is kind  my Harriet  It is kind  Lady L  to accompany Lady Clementina —Your goodness will be rewarded in being eye witnesses of the most gracious reception that ever indulgent parents gave to a long absent daughter   Ah  Chevalier  was all she could say   Let me conduct you  dearest Lady Clementina  into a drawing room  where you will see no other person but whom you now see  till your recovered spirits shall rejoice the dearest of friends   I was afraid she was too much discomposed to attend to this considerate expedient  I repeated  therefore  what Sir Charles last said  She was visibly encouraged by it  She gave him her trembling hand  and he led her into the prepared drawing room  Lady L  and I followed  and took our seats on each hand of her  Sir Charles his over against her  Our offered salts  and soothing  with difficulty kept her from fainting   When she was a little revived—Hush  said she  with her finger held up  and wildness in her looks  casting her eyes to the doors and windows in turn  They will hear us —Further recovering herself—O   181 Chevalier  said she  what shall I say  How shall I look  What shall I do —And am I  am I  indeed  in the same house with my Father  Mother  Jeronymo  Who else  Who else  with quickness   It is so ordered  my dearest Clementina  said Sir Charles  in love and tenderness to you  that you shall only see your Mother first  then your Father—At your own pleasure  your Brothers  Mrs  Beaumont  Father Marescotti   Sir Charles was sent for out—Don t  don t leave me  Sir  Then looking to Lady L  and then to me—You are all goodness  Ladies—Don t leave me   Sir Charles instantly returned  Your Mamma  madam  all indulgence  is impatient to fold you to her heart  What joy will you
