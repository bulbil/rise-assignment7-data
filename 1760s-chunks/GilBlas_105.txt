 said Rosimiro  a new stroke of our dear brother Cesarino  This very morning he bought silk stockings  ribbons  and laces  and sent them to rehearsal by a little page  as a present from a countess  What a knavish trick  said Signor de la Ventoleria  with a smile made up of fatuity and conceit  In my time there was more honesty  we never thought of descending to such impositions  To be sure  women of fashion were tender of our inventive faculties  nor did they leave such purchases to be made out of our own pockets  it was their whim  By the honour of our house  said Ricardo  in the same strain  that whim of theirs is lasting  and if it were allowable to kiss and tell         But one must be secret on these occasions  above all when persons of a certain rank are concerned   Gentlemen  interrupted Florimonde  a truce  if you please  with your conquests and successes  they are known over the whole earth  Apropos of Ismene  It is said that the nobleman who has fooled away so much money upon her  has at length recovered his senses  Yes  indeed  exclaimed Constance  and I can tell you besides that she has lost  by the same stroke  a snug little hero of the counting house  whose ruin would otherwise have been signed and sealed  I have the thing from the first hand  Her Mercury made an unfortunate mistake  for he carried a tender invitation to each  and delivered them wrong  These were great losses  my darling  quoth Florimonde  Oh  as for that of the lord  replied Constance  it is a very trifling matter  The man of blood had almost run through his estate  but the little fellow with the pen behind his ear was but just coming into play  He had never been fleeced before  it is a pity he should have escaped so easily   Such was the tenor of the conversation before dinner  and it was not much mended in its morality at table  As I should never have done with the recital of all their ribaldry and nonsense  the reader will excuse the omission  and pass on to the entrance of a poor devil  yclept an author  who called just before the cloth was taken away   Our little footboy came and said to my mistress in an audible voice    Madam  a man in a dirty shirt  splashed up to his middle  with very much the look of a poet  saving your presence  wants to speak to you  Let him walk up  answered Arsenia  Keep your seats  gentlemen  it is only an author  To be sure so it was  one whose tragedy had been accepted  and he was bringing my mistress her part  His name was Pedro de Moya  On coming into the room he made five or six low bows to the company  who neither rose nor took the least notice of him  Arsenia just returned his superabundant civilities with a slight inclination of the head  He came forward with tremor and embarrassment  He dropped his gloves and let his hat fall  He ventured to pick them up again  then advanced towards my mistress  and presenting to her a paper with more ceremony than a defendant an affidavit to the judge of the court    Madam  said he  have the goodness to receive under your protection the part I take the liberty of offering you  She stretched out her hand for it with cold and contemptuous indifference  nor did she condescend even to notice the compliment by a look   But our author was not disheartened  Seizing this opportunity to distribute the cast  he gave one character to Rosimiro and another to Florimonde  who treated him just as genteelly as Arsenia had done  On the contrary  the low comedian  a very pleasant fellow  as those gentlemen for the most part affect to be  insulted him with the most cutting sarcasms  Pedro de Moya was not made of stone  Yet he dared not take up the aggressor  lest his piece should suffer for it  He withdrew without saying a word  but stung to the quick  as it seemed to me  by his reception  He could not fail  in the transports of his anger  mentally to apostrophize the players as they deserved  and the players  when he was gone  began to talk of authors in return with infinite deference and kindness  It should seem  said Florimonde  as if Signor de Moya did not go away very well pleased   Well  madam  cried Rosimiro  and why should you trouble yourself about that  Are we to study the feelings of authors  If we were to admit them upon equal terms  it would only be the way to spoil them  I know that contemptible squad  I know them of old  they would soon forget their distance  There is no dealing with them but as slaves  and as for tiring their patience  never fear that  Though they may take themselves off in a pet sometimes  the itch of writing brings them back again  and they are raised to the third heaven  if we will but condescend to support their pieces
