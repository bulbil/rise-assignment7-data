not talk more than three hours  The senators and the player went away with Florimonde  whom they saw safe home   When they were gone  my mistress said to me    Here  Gil Blas  are ten pistoles to go to market to morrow  Five or six of our gentlemen and ladies are to dine here  take care that we are well served  Madam  answered I  with this sum there shall be a banquet for the whole troop  My friend  replied Arsenia  correct your phraseology  you must say company  not troop  A troop of robbers  a troop of beggars  a troop of authors  but a company of comedians  especially when you have to mention the actors of Madrid  I begged my mistress s pardon for having used so disrespectful a term  and entreated her to excuse my ignorance  I protested that henceforward  when I spoke collectively of so august a body  I would always say the company       CH  XI     A theatrical life and an author s life  I TOOK the field the next morning  to open my campaign as steward  It was a fish day  for which reason I bought some good fat chickens  rabbits  partridges  and every variety of game  As the gentlemen of the sock and buskin are not on the best possible terms with the church  they are not over scrupulous in their observance of the rubric  I brought home provisions more than enough for a dozen portly gentlemen to have fasted on during a whole Lent  The cook had a good morning s work  While she was getting dinner ready  Arsenia got up and spent the early part of the day at her toilet  At noon came two of the players  Signor Rosimiro and Signor Ricardo  Afterwards two actresses  Constance and Celinaura  then entered Florimonde  attended by a man who had all the appearance of a most spruce cavalier  He had his hair dressed in the most elegant manner  his hat set off with a fashionable plume  very tight breeches  and a shirt with a laced frill  His gloves and his handkerchief were in the hilt of his sword  and he wore his cloak with a grace altogether peculiar to himself   With a prepossessing physiognomy and a good person  there was something extraordinary in the first blush of him  This gentleman  said I to myself  must be an original  I was not mistaken  his singularities were striking  On his entrance  he ran with open arms and embraced the company  male and female  one after another  His grimaces were more extravagant than any I had yet seen in this region of foppery  My prediction was not falsified by his discourse  He dwelt with fondness on every syllable he uttered  and pronounced his words in an emphatic tone  with gestures and glances artfully adapted to the subject  I had the curiosity to ask Laura who this strange figure might be  I forgive you  said she  this instance of an inquisitive disposition  It is impossible to see and to hear Signor Carlos Alonso de la Ventoleria for the first time  without having such a natural longing  I will paint him to the life  In the first place  he was originally a player  He left the stage through caprice  and has since repented in sober sadness of the step  Did you notice his dark hair  Every thread of it is pencilled  as well as his eyebrows and his whiskers  He was born in the reign of Saturn s father  in the age before the golden  but as there were no parish registers at that time  he avails himself of the primitive barbarism  and dates at least twenty centuries below the true epoch  Moreover  his self sufficiency keeps pace with his antiquity  He passed the olympiads of his youth in the grossest ignorance  but taking a fancy to become learned about the Christian era  he engaged a private tutor  who taught him to spell in Greek and Latin  Nay  more  he knows by heart an infinite number of good stories  which he has given so often as genuine  that he actually begins to believe them himself  They are eternally pressed into the service  and it may truly be said that his wit shines at the expense of his memory  He is thought to be a great actor  I am willing to believe it implicitly  but I must own he is not to my taste  He declaims here sometimes  and I have observed  among other defects  an affectation in his delivery  with a tremulousness of voice bordering on the antiquated and ridiculous   Such was the portrait drawn by my abigail of this honorary spouter  and never was mortal of a more stately carriage  He prided himself too on being an agreeable companion  He never was at a loss for a commodity of trite remarks  which he delivered with an air of authority  On the other hand  the Thespian fraternity were not much addicted to silence  They began canvassing their absent colleagues in a manner little consistent with charity  it must be owned  but this is a failing pardonable in players as well as in authors  The fire grew brisk and the satire personal  You have not heard  ladies
