which he had been accused of drinking  I would not lose so fair an occasion of learning all I wanted to know  and plied my questions so successfully as to go home with much self complacency  at my punctual performance of my engagements with my mistress  It was on the coming night that I was to see her again at the same hour and in the same manner as the first time  I was not in such a confounded hurry this evening  Far from writhing with impatience under the prolixity of my old commander  I led him on to the charge  I waited for midnight with the greatest indifference in the world  and it was not till all the clocks within ear shot had struck that I crept down into the garden  without any nonsense of pomatum and perfumery  That foppery was completely cured   At the place of meeting I found the very faithful duenna  who sneeringly reproached me with a defalcation in my zeal  I made her no answer  but suffered myself to be conducted into Aurora s chamber  She asked me  as soon as I made my appearance  whether I had gained any intelligence of Don Lewis  Yes  madam  said I  and you shall have the sum total in two words  I must first tell you  that he will soon set out for Salamanca  to finish his studies  The young gentleman is brim full of honour and probity  As for valour  he cannot be deficient there  since he is a man of birth and a Castilian  Besides this  he has an infinite deal of wit  and is very agreeable in his manners  but there is one thing which can scarcely be to your liking  He is pretty much in the fashion of our young nobility here at court    exemplarily catholic in his devotions to the fair  Have you not heard that at his age he has already been tenant at will to two actresses  What is it you tell me  replied Aurora  What shocking conduct  But do you know for certain  Gil Blas  that he leads so dissolute a life  Oh  there is no doubt of it  madam  rejoined I  A servant  turned off this morning  told me so  and servants are very plain dealers when the failings of their masters are the topic  Besides  he keeps company with Don Alexo Segiar  Don Antonio Centellés  and Don Fernando de Gamboa  that single circumstance proves his libertinism with all the force of demonstration  It is enough  Gil Blas  said my mistress with a sigh  on your report I am determined to struggle with my unworthy passion  Though it has already struck deep root in my heart  I do not despair of tearing it forcibly from its bed  Go  added she  putting into my hands a small purse  none of the lightest  take this for your pains  Beware of betraying my secret  Consider it as entrusted to your silence   I assured my mistress that she might be perfectly easy on that score  for I was the Harpocrates of confidential servants  After this compliment to myself  I withdrew with no small eagerness to investigate the contents of the purse  There were twenty pistoles  It struck me all at once that Aurora would surely have given me more had I been the bearer of pleasant tidings  since she paid so handsomely for a blank in the lottery  I was sorry not to have adopted the policy of the pleaders in the courts  who sometimes paint the cheek of truth when her natural complexion is inclined to be cadaverous  It was a pity to have stifled an amour in the birth which might in its growth have been so profitable  Yet I had the comfort of finding myself reimbursed the expense so unseasonably incurred in perfumery and washes       CH  III     A great change at Don Vincent s  Aurora s strange resolution   IT happened soon after this adventure that Signor Don Vincent fell sick  Independent of his very advanced age  the symptoms of his disorder appeared in so formidable a shape that a fatal termination was but too probable  From the beginning of his illness he was attended by two of the most eminent physicians in Madrid  One was Doctor Andros  and the other Doctor Oquetos  They considered the case with due solemnity  and both agreed  after a strict investigation  that the humours were in a state of mutiny  but this was the only thing about which they did agree  The proper practice  said Andros  is to purge the humours  though raw  with all possible expedition  while they are in a violent agitation of flux and reflux  for fear of their fixing upon some noble part  Oquetos maintained  on the contrary  that we must wait till the humours were ripened before it would be safe to go upon purgatives  But your method  replied the first speaker  is directly in the teeth of the rules laid down by the prince of medicine  Hippocrates recommends purging in the most burning fever from the very first attack  and says in plain terms that no time is to be lost in purging when the humours are in    asµ    orgasmos   that is to say  in a state of
