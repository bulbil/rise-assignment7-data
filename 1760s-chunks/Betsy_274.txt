as it was highly disagreeable to him to enter into any   discussions on that head  it was some time before he could resolve   within himself what answer he should send       But whatever deficiencies there might be in this gentleman  none    excepting those of his own family  to whom he did not think it worth his   while to be complaisant  could ever accuse him of want of politeness  a   character so dear to him  that  perhaps he would not have forfeited it    even for the attainment of any other of the more shining and valuable   virtues of his sex       Perplexing  therefore  as he knew this interview must necessarily be to   him  he could not think of behaving in an uncourtly manner to a   gentleman of Sir Ralph Trusty s rank and fortune  and having ordered   that the servant who brought the letter should come up  desired him  in   the most affable terms  to acquaint his master that nothing should   deprive him of the honour of attending him the moment he was dressed       Sir Ralph Trusty  in his younger years  had lived very much in London    had kept the best company in it  and though he was perfectly sincere in   his nature  and had a thorough contempt for all those idle superfluous   ceremonies  which some people look upon as the height of good breeding    and value themselves so much upon  yet he knew how to put them in   practice when ever he found they would facilitate any point he had to   gain  and as Mr  Munden was altogether the courtier in his behaviour  he   thought it best to address him in his own way  and receive him rather in   a manner as if he was about to praise him for some laudable action he   had done  than make any remonstrances to him on a conduct which he   wanted to convince him required some amendment       After having said a great many obliging things to him  in order to bring   him into a humour proper for his purpose  the politick old baronet began   in these terms to open the business on which he had desired to speak   with him        I have not words to make you sensible   continued he   how much your   absence was regretted yesterday by all the company at Mr  Goodman s    especially by the two Mr  Thoughtlesses  who  indeed  on all occasions    express the highest esteem and regard for you  both as a friend and   brother  but I was more particularly affected  when  on coming home  my   wife acquainted me with what she imagined the real cause that deprived   us of you        She told me   added he   that having the other day surprized Mrs    Munden in tears and great confusion  she would not leave her until she   wrested from her a secret  which I am equally ashamed and sorry to   repeat  but which you can be at no loss to guess at        Though Mr  Munden had foreseen on what account he was sent for  and had   prepared himself for it  yet he could to forbear testifying some   confusion  but  recovering himself from it as soon as he could   Yes    Sir Ralph  I easily perceive   answered he   that my wife has been   making some complaints against me to your lady  which  doubtless  have   laid me under her displeasure  as I know the accuser has the advantage   of the accused  in the opinion of those to whom they appeal         Not at all   cried Sir Ralph hastily   I dare answer that my wife is no   less concerned for your sake  than for that of Mrs  Munden  at the   unfortunate disagreement that has happened between you        As he was speaking these words  Lady Trusty  either by design or   accident  passed by the door of the room where they were sitting   Come   in  my dear   said Sir Ralph to her   and justify yourself from being   swayed against right reason  by any partial affection to your fair   friend         If you mean in the case of Mrs  Munden  as I suppose you do   replied   she   I can acquit myself with very great ease from any imputation on   that score  and am ready  even before her husband  to give it as my   judgment  that  in all disputes between persons who are married to each   other  especially when carried to any height  neither of them are wholly   faultless  for  though one may be the
