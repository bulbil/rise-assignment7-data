horse  quoth my father  and do you go directly for Dr  Slop  the man midwife  with all our services —and let him know your Mistress is fallen into labour —and that I desire he will return with you with all speed   It is very strange  says my father  addressing himself to my uncle Toby  as Obadiah shut the door —as there is so expert an operator as Dr  Slop so near—that my wife should persist to the very last in this obstinate humour of hers  in trusting the life of my child  who has had one misfortune already  to the ignorance of an old woman —and not only the life of my child  brother —but her own    life  and with it the lives of all the children I might  peradventure  have begot out of her hereafter   Mayhap  brother  replied my uncle Toby  my sister does it to save the expence —A pudding s end —replied my father —the doctor must be paid the same for inaction as action —if not better —to keep him in temper   —Then it can be out of nothing in the whole world  quoth my uncle Toby  in the simplicity of his heart —but MODESTY —My sister  I dare say  added he  does not care to let a man come so near her          I will not say whether my uncle Toby had completed the sentence or not — tis for his advantage to suppose he had —as  I think  he could have added no    ONE WORD which would have improved it   If  on the contrary  my uncle Toby had not fully arrived at his period s end —then the world stands indebted to the sudden snapping of my father s tobacco pipe  for one of the neatest examples of that ornamental figure in oratory  which Rhetoricians stile the Aposiopesis —Just heaven  how does the Poco piu and the Poco meno of the Italian artists —the insensible MORE or LESS  determine the precise line of beauty in the sentence  as well as in the statue  How do the slight touches of the chifel  the pencil  the pen  the fiddle stick  et caetera —give the true swell  which give the true pleasure —O my countrymen —be nice —be cautious of your language —and never  O  never let it be forgotten upon what    small particles your eloquence and your fame depend   — My sister  mayhap   quoth my uncle Toby   does not choose to let a man come so near her          Make this dash — tis an Aposiopesis —Take the dash away  and write Backside — tis Bawdy —Scratch Backside out  and put Cover d way in — tis a Metaphor —and  I dare say  as fortification ran so much in my uncle Toby s head  that if he had been left to have added one word to the sentence —that word was it   But whether that was the case or not the case —or whether the snapping of my father s tobacco pipe so critically  happened thro  accident or anger —will be seen in due time     CHAP  VII   THO  my father was a good natural philosopher —yet he was something of a moral philosopher too  for which reason  when his tobacco pipe snapp d short in the middle —he had nothing to do —as such —but to have taken hold of the two pieces  and thrown them gently upon the back of the fire —He did no such thing —he threw them with all the violence in the world —and  to give the action still more emphasis —he started up upon both his legs to do it   This look d something like heat —and the manner of his reply to what my uncle Toby was saying  prov d it was so     — Not choose   quoth my father  repeating my uncle Toby s words   to let a man come so near her  —By heaven  brother Toby  you would try the patience of a Job —and I think I have the plagues of one already  without it —Why —Where —Wherein —Wherefore —Upon what account  replied my uncle Toby  in the utmost astonishment —To think  said my father  of a man living to your age  brother  and knowing so little about women —I know nothing at all about them —replied my uncle Toby  and I think  continued he  that the shock I received the year after the demolition of Dunkirk  in my affair with widow Wadman —which shock you know I should not have received  but from my total ignorance of the sex —has given me just cause to say  That I neither know  nor do pretend to    know  any thing about  em  or their concerns either —Methinks  brother  replied my father  you might  at least  know so much as the right end of a woman from the wrong   It is said in Aristotle s Master Piece   That when a man doth think of any thing which is past —he looketh down upon the ground —but that when he thinketh of something which is to come  he looketh up towards the heavens    My uncle Toby  I suppose  thought
