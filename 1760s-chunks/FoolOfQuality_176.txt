I   endeavoured to conceal my affection for this your resemblance  and   never made my court to it but when I was alone      The morning after your visit  on your return from Paris  as I was   carelessly performing the business of my little toilette before the   glass  I took out your picture  and surveyed it with new and   increasing delight  In the mean time I did not know that my   mamma stood behind me  attentive to all my motions  that were   reflected to her by the mirror  She heard me talk to your picture    she saw me kiss it  and eagerly press it to my bosom  At last I   turned my eye to the glass  and perceived a piece of her image     whereon I started  coloured  and trembled  and was thrown  I knew   not why  into the utmost confusion      Ah  Fanny   cried my mother  what is this that I see   your   young heart  my child  is certainly affected  Unquestionably you   love your cousin Clinton      Ought I not to love him  madam  does he not love me as well   as I love him   No  no  my darling   said my mother  I would to   heaven that he did  Your cousin Clinton indeed is worthy of all   love  but then he has lately given away his heart to another  He   is married  my Fanny And cannot he love me still  for all   that  madam  By no means  my sweet innocent  When once a   man marries  he vows  and swears  and obliges himself to love   nobody living but his wife  and what is more  my Fanny  it is   accounted very naughty in any girl to think of loving such a one   afterwards          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  175     What emotions did I then feel   what a conflict of opposing   passions   but resentment  for the time got the upper hand  I had   yet formed no idea of the relations of sex  or matrimony  or any   conjugal obligation save that of love alone  But then it was suffi    cient to me that I had given you my whole heart   that nothing   less than your whole heart could satisfy me in return   and I felt   myself offended and outraged to the last degree  by your having   imparted a share thereof to another      The day following  as I sat languid and much discomposed  as   well by my passion as want of rest the night before  my mamma   came up to tell me that you were below  and inquired for me  No    no  my dearest mamma  said I  it does not signify  I will not see   him  Let him go to whomever he loves best  But what shall   I say to him  my Fanny   what excuse shall I make   No matter   for excuse  madam  tell him that I never desire to see his face   any more      As something informed me that you could not help still loving   me a little  T laid hold of that little love to pique  and disoblige  and   be revenged of you for your perfidy   and  as long as you stayed    the thoughts of the pain and uneasiness I presumed you were under    gave me vast delight  But as soon as I was told you were gone    my heart sunk down  as from a mount of triumph  into a depth   of desolation      My mamma came up to console me  She highly applauded my   spirit  and the resentment I had showed   and she blamed you for   marrying another  at a time that you pretended so much fondness   to me  She further endeavoured to set me against your age    She told me that you must soon be old and ugly and wrinkled    and that you were much fitter to be my father than my lover    She also spoke to me of my vast fortune  of my beauty  and so   forth  and that I might have my pick and choice of all the   young and handsome earls and dukes in the nation  She opened   to me  in a variety of glittering prospects  all the pleasures and   advantages of wealth  title  state  equipage  with the respects and   admiration of crowds bending around me  As she represented   them to my imagination  I catched at each of them for comfort     but  alas   I did not find you among them  and all to me became   empty      That
