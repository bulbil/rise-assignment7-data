preach for the world  and the world shall pay us for preaching  whether we like each other or not      LETTER LVII  From Hingpo to Lien Chi Altangi  by the way of Moscow   YOU will probably be pleased to see my letter dated from Terki  a city which lies beyond the bounds of the Persian empire  here  blessed   255 with security  with all that is dear  I double my raptures  by communicating them to you  the mind sympathizing with the freedom of the body  my whole soul is dilated in gratitude  love  and praise   Yet were my own happiness all that inspired my present joy  my raptures might justly merit the imputation of self interest  but when I think that the beautiful Zelis is also free  forgive my triumph when I boast of having rescued from captivity the most deserving object upon earth   You remember the reluctance she testified at being obliged to marry the tyrant she hated  Her compliance at last was only feigned  in order to gain time to try some future means of escape  During the interval between her promise and the intended performance of it  she came undiscovered one evening to the place where I generally retired after the fatigues of the day  her appearance was like that of an aerial genius  when it descends to minister comfort to undeserved distress  the mild lustre of her eye served to banish my timidity  her accents were sweeter than the eccho of some distant symphony   Unhappy stranger  said she  in the Persian language  you here perceive one more wretched than thyself  all this solemnity of preparation  this elegance of dress  and the number of my attendants  serve but to encrease my miseries  if you have courage to rescue an unhappy woman from approaching ruin  and our detested tyrant  you may depend upon my future gratitude   I bowed to the ground  and she left me  filled with rapture and astonishment  Night brought no rest  nor could the ensuing morning calm the anxieties   256 of my mind  I projected a thousand methods for her delivery  but each  when strictly examined  appeared impracticable  in this uncertainty the evening again arrived  and I placed myself on my former station in hopes of a repeated visit  After some short expectation  the bright perfection again appeared  I bowed  as before  to the ground  when raising me up she observed  that the time was not to be spent in useless ceremony  she observed that the day following was appointed for the celebration of her nuptials  and that something was to be done that very night for our mutual deliverance  I offered with the utmost humility to pursue whatever scheme she should direct  upon which she proposed that instant to scale the garden wall  adding  that she had prevailed upon a female slave  who was now waiting at the appointed place  to assist her with a ladder   Pursuant to this information I led her trembling to the place appointed  but instead of the slave we expected to see  Mostadad himself was there awaiting our arrival  the wretch in whom we confided  it seems  had betrayed our design to her master  and he now saw the most convincing proofs of her information  He was just going to draw his sabre  when a principle of avarice repressed his fury  and he resolved  after a severe chastisement  to dispose of me to another master  in the mean time ordering me to be confined in the strictest manner  and the next day to receive an hundred blows on the soles of my feet   When the morning came I was led out in order to receive the punishment  which  from the sevety with which it is generally inflicted upon slaves  is worse even than death     257A trumpet was to be a signal for the solemnization of the nuptials of Zelis  and for the infliction of my punishment  Each ceremony to me equally dreadful were just going to begin  when we were informed that a large party of Circassian Tartars had invaded the town  and were laying all in ruin  Every person now thought only of saving himself  I instantly unloosed the cords with which I was bound  and seizing a scymetar from one of the slaves who had not courage to resist me  flew to the women s apartment where Zelis was confined  dressed out for the intended nuptials  I bade her follow me without delay  and going forward  cut my way through eunuchs  who made but a faint resistance  The whole city was now a scene of conflagration and terror  every person was willing to save himself  unmindful of others  In this confusion seizing upon two of the fleetest coursers in the stables of Mostadad  we fled northward towards the kingdom of Circassia  As there were several others flying in the same manner  we passed without notice  and in three days arrived at Terki  a city that lies in a valley within the bosom of the frowning mountains of Caucasus   Here  free from every apprehension of danger  we enjoy all those satisfactions which are consistent with virtue  though I find my heart at intervals give way to unusual passions  yet such is my admiration for my fair companion  that I lose even
