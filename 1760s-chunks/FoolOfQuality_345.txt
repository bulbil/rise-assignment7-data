 But I must be a knight adventurer   forsooth  and draw my sword in defence of every scoundrel who   goes the street      I then went and felt the windows  to try if I could force a   passage for making my escape   but finding that all were grated   with strong and impassable bars of iron Oh  I cried  that this   marquis  this ungrateful D Aubigny  were now in his fullest   strength  and opposed to me point to point  that I might reclaim   from him in an instant the life I have given       I then traversed the room with an inconsistent pace  now rashly   resolving on furious events  and again more sedately deliberating   on what I had to do  till  having ruminated thus for the remainder   of the night  I at last became more at ease  and resigned myself   to the dispensations of all disposing Providence  though  I confess    with a gloomy and reluctant kind of content      When the day appeared  and was something advanced  I heard   my door unlocking  and the chain taken away  and I concluded   that they came to summon me to my trial  But  instead of the   officers of justice  I saw near twenty men in the marquis s livery    who silently bowed down before me  and respectfully showed me   with their hands the way out of my prison  I followed them also   in silence  and  getting into the street  I wished to know if I was   really free  and turned from them down the way that led to my   lodgings   whereupon they cast themselves before me  and in a   supplicating posture besought me to go with them      Finding then that I was still their prisoner  I gave a longing   look out for my valiant fellows  but  as they did not appear    I suffered myself to be reconducted to the marquis s palace  and   followed my obsequious commanders into the proud apartment   to which they had led me the preceding night  and where  bowing   to the ground  they all left me and retired      As I had been much fatigued in body and mind  I threw myself   on the bed  leaving events to their issues  and fell into a kind of   starting and intermitting slumber  when I heard a voice at my side   shout out in once loved accents Oh  my dearest mamma  it is he     indeed it is he it is he himself      On this I awoke and roused myself  and lifting my languid eyes    and fixing them on the object that stood before me And are you   then  I cried  are you also  Louisa  in the confederacy against me     Say nothing  you are not the Louisa I once knew  I will arise    I will go forth   not all your gates and bars and bolts shall hold   me   I will tear my body  and my soul too  if possible  from you   for ever   Go to your betrothed  to your beloved   and leave me to         382 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      perish   it is a matter of no import  I am yet pleased that I saved   your chosen  as it may one day serve to reproach you with the   merits of the man whom he has so unworthily treated       I could no more  A long silence on all sides ensued  save the   language that was uttered by heavings and sobbings  when the   marchioness  coming and casting herself on her knees by my bed   You have reason  sir   she exclaimed you have reason to reproach   and to detest every branch of our ungrateful family for ever   You   saved myself  you saved my daughter   and yet the father and the   husband proved averse to your deservings  and turned your benefits   into poison  You have now saved our son  the only one who can   convey our name to posterity   and yet  from the beginning  you   have received nothing in return save wounds  pains  and sickness    losses  damages  and disappointments  and at this very day the most   ignominious usage  where you merited endless thanks and ever    lasting renown  Blame my Louisa  then  and me   but blame not   my son  sir  for these unworthy events  He is shocked and dis    tracted by them   he is quite innocent of them   he respects and   loves you more than ever Jonathan loved the son of Jesse   but he   will not  he dare not see you  till we
