many   compliments       They all went into the garden for a walk  before dinner  and  I   understood  were so impatient to see me  that my master took them into   the largest alcove  after they had walked two or three turns  and stept   himself to me  Come  my Pamela  said he  the ladies can t be satisfied   without seeing you  and I desire you ll come  I said  I was ashamed  but   I would obey him  Said he  The two young ladies are dressed out in their   best attire  but they make not such an appearance as my charming girl   in this ordinary garb   Sir  said I  shan t I follow you thither  For   I can t bear you should do me so much honour  Well  said he  I ll go   before you  And he bid Mrs  Jewkes bring a bottle of sack  and some   cake  So he went down to them       This alcove fronts the longest gravel walk in the garden  so that   they saw me all the way I came  for a good way  and my master told me   afterwards  with pleasure  all they said of me       Will you forgive the little vain slut  your daughter  if I tell you all    as he was pleased to tell me  He said   spying me first  Look  there    ladies  comes my pretty rustic   They all  I saw  which dashed me  stood   at the windows  and in the door way  looking full at me       My master told me  that Lady Jones said  She is a charming creature  I   see that  at this distance  And Sir Simon  it seems  who has been a sad   rake in his younger days  swore he never saw so easy an air  so fine   a shape  and so graceful a presence   The Lady Darnford said  I was a   sweet girl  And Mrs  Peters said very handsome things  Even the parson   said  I should be the pride of the county  O  dear sirs  all this was   owing to the light my good master s favour placed me in  which made   me shine out in their eyes beyond my deserts  He said the young ladies   blushed  and envied me       When I came near  he saw me in a little confusion  and was so kind as   to meet me  Give me your hand  said he  my poor girl  you walk too fast     for  indeed  I wanted to be out of their gazing   I did so  with a   courtesy  and he led me up the steps of the alcove  and  in a most   gentleman like manner  presented me to the ladies  and they all saluted   me  and said  They hoped to be better acquainted with me  and   Lady Darnford was pleased to say  I should be the flower of their   neighbourhood  Sir Simon said  Good neighbour  by your leave  and   saluting me  added  Now will I say  that I have kissed the loveliest   maiden in England  But  for all this  methought I owed him a grudge   for a tell tale  though all had turned out so happily  Mr  Peters very   gravely followed his example  and said  like a bishop  God bless you    fair excellence  said Lady Jones  Pray  dear madam  sit down by me    and they all sat down  But I said  I would stand  if they pleased    No  Pamela  said my master  pray sit down with these good ladies  my   neighbours   They will indulge it to you  for my sake  till they know   you better  and for your own  when they are acquainted with you  Sir    said I  I shall be proud to deserve their indulgence       They all so gazed at me  that I could not look up  for I think it is one   of the distinctions of persons of condition  and well bred people  to   put bashful bodies out of countenance  Well  Sir Simon  said my master    what say you now to my pretty rustic   He swore a great oath  that he   should better know what to say to me if he was as young as himself  Lady   Darnford said  You will never leave  Sir Simon       Said my master  You are a little confused  my good girl  and out of   breath  but I have told all my kind neighbours here a good deal of your   story  and your excellence
