have been admitted to the presence of Clementina  and have hopes that she will soon recover her peace of mind  I can the more chearfully obey you   I was exactly at the hour at the appointed place  Laura guessed at my chair  and my servants  as they crossed the way  and stood out on the pavement  that I might see her  When she found she had caught my eye  she ran into the house  wringing her clasped hands—God be praised  God be praised  were her words  as I followed her in  in her own language  Laura can speak no other  Shew me  shew me  to your Lady  good Laura  said I  with emotion   She ran up one pair of stairs before me  She entered the dining room  as it is called  I stopt at the stairs head till I had Clementina s commands  Laura soon came out  She held open the door for me  courtefying in silence   The drawn window curtains darkened the room  But the dignity of Clementina s air and motion left me not in doubt  She stood up  supporting herself on the back of an elbow chair     119 On one knee  taking her trembling hand  Welcome  thrice welcome to England  dearest Lady Clementina  I pressed her hand with my lips  and rising  seated her  For she trembled  she sobbed  she endeavoured to speak  but could not for some moments   I called to Laura  fearing she was fainting   O that well known voice  said she  And do you  can you  bid me welcome —Me  a fugitive  an ingrate  undutiful —O Chevalier  lower not your unfullied character  by approving so unnatural a step as that which I have taken   I do bid you welcome  madam  Your brother  your friend  from his soul  welcomes you to England   Let me know  Chevalier  before another word passes  Whether I have a Father  whether I have a Mother   Blessed be God  madam  you have both   She lifted up her clasped hand  Thank God  God  I thank thee  Distraction would have been my portion  if I had not  I was afraid to ask after them  I should have thought myself the most detestable of parricides  if either of them had been no more   They are in the utmost distress for your safety  They will think themselves happy  when they know you are well  and in the protection of your brother Grandison   Will they  Sir  O what a paradox  They so indulgent  yet so cruel—I  so dutiful  yet a fugitive  But tell me  Sir  determined as I was against entering into a state I too much honour to enter into it with a reluctant heart  could I take any other step than that I have taken  to free myself from the cruelty of persuasion  O that I might have been permitted to take the veil —But answer my question  Chevalier   Surely  madam  they would not have compelled you  They always declared to me they would not   Not compelled me  Sir  Did not my father kneel to me  My mother s eyes spoke more than her lips   120could have uttered  The Bishop had influenced good Father Marescotti  against the interests of Religion  I had almost said  to oppose the wish of my heart  Jeronymo  your Jeronymo  gave into their measures  What refuge had I —Our Glacomo was inexorable  I was to be met on my return from Florence to Bologna  by the Count of Belvedere  and all those of his house  the General was to be in his company  I had secret intelligence of all this  And I was to be received as an actual bride at Bologna  or made to promise I would be so within a few days after my arrival  My Sister in law  my only advocate among my Italian friends  pitied me  it is true  But  for that reason  she was not to be allowed to come to Bologna  I was at other times denied to go to Urbino  to Rome  to Naples—Could I do otherwise than I have done  if I would avoid prosaning a Sacrament   My dearest sister Clementina sometimes accuses herself of rashness  for taking a step so extraordinary  At this moment  does she not receive her brother in darkness  Whence this sweet consciousness  But what is done is done  Your Conscience is a Law to you  who shall condemn —Let us look forward  madam  I approve not of the vehemence of your friends persuasions  Yet what parents ever meant a child more indulgence  what brothers  a sister more disinterested affection   I own  sir  that my heart at times misgives me  But answer me this  Are you of opinion that I ought  at the instance of my parents and brothers  however affectionate  however indulgent in all other instances  to marry against inclination  against justice  against conscience   Against any one of these you ought not   Well  Sir  then I will endeavour to make myself easy as to this article
