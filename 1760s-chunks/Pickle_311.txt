trifle as half a guinea  the whole  town crowded into my house  in order to subscribe  But there I was their  humble servant   Gentlemen  you must have a little patience till my  own particular friends are served   Among that number  I do myself the  honour to consider Mr  Pickle  Here is a copy of the proposals  and  if  the list should be adorned with his name  I hope  notwithstanding his  merited success among the young ladies  he will for once be shunned by  that little vixen called Miss Fortune  he  he  he    So saying  he bowed with a thousand apish congees  and presented his  paper to Peregrine  who  seeing the number of subscribers was limited to  one hundred  said he thought him too moderate in his expectations  as  he did not doubt that his picture would be a cheap purchase at five  hundred  instead of fifty pounds  at which the price was fixed  To this  unexpected remark Pallet answered  that among the connoisseurs he would  not pretend to appraise his picture  but that  in valuing his works  he  was obliged to have an eye to the Gothic ignorance of the age in which  he lived  Our adventurer saw at once into the nature of this raffle   which was no other than a begging shift to dispose of a paltry piece   that he could not otherwise have sold for twenty shillings  However  far  from shocking the poor man in distress  by dropping the least hint  of his conjecture  he desired to be favoured with six chances  if the  circumstances of his plan would indulge him so far  and the painter   after some hesitation  condescended to comply with his request  out of  pure friendship and veneration  though he observed  that  in so doing   he must exclude some of his most intimate companions  Having received  the money he gave Pickle his address  desiring he would  with his  convenience  visit the princess  who  he was sure  would display her  most engaging attractions  in order to captivate his fancy  and took his  leave extremely well pleased with the success of his application   Though Peregrine was tempted with the curiosity of seeing this portrait   which he imagined must contain some analogy to the ridiculous oddity of  the painter  he would not expose himself to the disagreeable alternative  of applauding the performance  contrary to the dictates of conscience  and common sense  or of condemning it  to the unspeakable mortification    6 22 15  3 45 PM   of the miserable author  and therefore never dreamt of returning the  painter s visit  Nor did he ever hear of the lottery s being drawn   About this time he was invited to spend a few weeks at the country seat  of a certain nobleman  with whom he had contracted an acquaintance   in the course of his debauches  which we have already described  His  lordship being remarkable for his skill and success in horse racing  his  house was continually filled with the connoisseurs and admirers of that  sport  upon which the whole conversation turned  insomuch that Peregrine  gradually imbibed some knowledge in horse flesh  and the diversions of  the course  for the whole occupation of the day  exclusive of eating and  drinking  consisted in viewing  managing  and exercising his lordship s  stud   Our hero looked upon these amusements with an eye of taste as well as  curiosity  he contemplated the animal as a beautiful and elegant part of  the creation  and relished the surprising exertion of its speed with  a refined and classical delight  In a little time he became personally  acquainted with every horse in the stable  and interested himself in the  reputation of each  while he also gratified his appetite for knowledge   in observing the methods of preparing their bodies  and training them to  the race  His lordship saw and encouraged his eagerness  from which he  promised himself some advantage  he formed several private matches for  his entertainment  and flattered his discernment  by permitting him to  be successful in the first bets he made  Thus was he artfully decoyed  into a spirit of keenness and adventure  and disposed to depend upon his  own judgment  in opposition to that of people who had made horse racing  the sole study of their lives  He accompanied my lord to Newmarket  and   entering at once into the genius of the place  was marked as fair game   by all the knowing ones there assembled  many of whom found means  to take him in  in spite of all the cautions and admonitions of his  lordship  who wanted to reserve him for his own use   It is almost impossible for any man  let him be never so fearful or  phlegmatic  to be an unconcerned spectator in this busy scene  The demon  of play hovers in the air  like a pestilential vapour  tainting the  minds of all present with infallible infection  which communicates  from one person to another  like the circulation of a
