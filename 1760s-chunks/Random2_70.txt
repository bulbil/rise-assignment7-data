very ludicrous attitude  while my Dulcinea was applauded to the skies  for the brilliancy of her wit  and her acquaintance immediately courted by the best people of both sexes in the room —This event  with which I was infinitely pleased at first  did not fail of alarming me  upon further reflection  when I considered that the more she was caressed by persons of distinction  the more her pride would be inflamed  and consequently  the obstacles to my success multiplied and enlarged —Nor were my presaging fears untrue—That very night I perceived her a little intoxicated with the incense she had received    205 and though she still behaved with a particular civility to me  I foresaw that as soon as her fortune should be known  she would be surrounded with a swarm of admirers  some one of whom might possibly  by excelling me in point of wealth  or in the arts of flattery and scandal  supplant me in her esteem  and find means to make the mother of his party —I resolved therefore to lose no time  and being invited to spend the evening with them  found an opportunity  in spite of the old gentlewoman s vigilance  to explain the meaning of my glances in the coach  by paying homage to her wit  and professing myself enamoured of her person —She blushed at my declaration  and in a favourable manner disapproved of the liberty I had taken  putting me in mind of our being strangers to one another  and desiring I would not be the means of interrupting our acquaintance  by any such unseasonable strokes of gallantry for the future —My ardour was effectually checked by this reprimand  which was  however  delivered in such a gentle manner  that I had no cause to be disobliged  and the arrival of her mother relieved me from a dilemma in which I should not have known how to demean myself a minute longer —Neither could I resume the easiness of carriage with which I came in  my mistress acted on the reserve  and the conversation beginning to flag  the old lady introduced her kinswoman of the house  and proposed a hand at whist     While we amused ourselves at this diversion  I understood from the gentlewoman  that there was to be an assembly next night  at which I begged to have the honour of dancing with Miss  She thanked me for the favour I intended her  assured me  she   206 never did dance  but signified a desire of seeing the company  upon which I offered my service  and was accepted  not a little proud of being exempted from appearing with her  in a situation  that  notwithstanding my profession to the contrary  was not at all agreeable to my inclination   Having supped  and continued the game  till such time as the successive yawns of the mother warned me to begone  I took my leave  and went home  where I made Strap very happy with an account of my progress —Next day I put on my gayest apparel  and went to drink tea at Mrs  Snapper s  according to appointment  when I found  to my inexpressible satisfaction  that she was laid up with the tooth ach  and that Miss was to be intrusted to my care —Accordingly  we set out for the ball room  pretty early in the evening  and took possession of a commodious place  where we had not sat longer than a quarter of an hour  when a gentleman dressed in a green frock came in  leading a young lady  whom I immediately discovered to be the adorable Narcissa  Good heaven  what were the thrillings of my soul at that instant  my reflection was overwhelmed with a torrent of agitation  my heart throbbed with surprizing violence  a sudden mist overspread my eyes  my ears were invaded with a dreadful sound  I panted for want of breath  and in short  was for some moments intranced —This first tumult subsiding  a crowd of flattering ideas rushed upon my imagination  Every thing that was soft  sensible  and engaging in the character of that dear creature  recurred to my remembrance  and every favourable circumstance of my own qualifications appeared in all   207 the aggravation of self conceit  to heighten my expectation —Neither was this transport of long duration  The dread of her being already disposed of  intervened  and over cast my enchanting reverie  My presaging apprehension represented her encircled in the arms of some happy rival  and of consequence for ever lost to me  I was stung with this suggestion  and believing the person who conducted her  to be the husband of this amiable young lady  already devoted him to my fury  and stood up to mark him for my vengeance  when I recollected  to my unspeakable joy  her brother the foxhunter  in the person of her gallant —Undeceived so much to my satisfaction in this particular  I gazed in a frenzy of delight  on the irresistible charms of his sister  who no sooner distinguished me in the crowd  than her evident confusion afforded a happy omen to my flame —At sight of me she started  the roses instantly vanished from her polished cheeks  and returned in a moment with a double glow that over spread her lovely neck  while her enchanting bosom heaved with strong emotion —I hailed these favourable symptoms
