for some time  I announced my intention  with the reasons of it  to my mother  who  considering my uncouth reception as no very flattering compliment to herself  did not urge my longer stay among people so little inclined to treat me civilly  The only point remaining now to be discussed was her future destiny and provision  My dear mother  said I  since my uncle stands so much in need of your attendance  I will no longer urge you to go along with me  but  as his days seem likely to be very few on earth  you must promise to come and take up your abode with me at my farm  as soon as the last duties are performed to his honoured remains   I shall make no such promise  answered my mother  for I mean to pass the remnant of my days in the Asturias  and in a state of perfect independence  Will you not on all occasions  replied I  be absolute mistress in my household  May be so  and may be not  rejoined she  you have only to fall in love with some flirt of a girl  and then you will marry  then she will be my daughter in  law  and I shall be her stepmother  and then we shall live together as step mothers and daughters in law usually do  Your prognostics  said I  are fetched from a great distance  I have not at present the most remote intention of entering into the happy state  but even though such a whim should take possession of my brain  I will pledge myself for instructing my wife betimes in an implicit submission to your will and pleasure  That is giving security  without the means of making good your contract  replied my mother  you would scarcely be able to justify bail  I would not even swear that in our sparring matches  you might not take your wife s part in preference to mine  however ill she might behave  or however unreasonably she might argue   You talk very excellent sense  madam  cried my secretary  coming in for his share of the conversation  I think just as you do  that docility is about as much the virtue of a donkey as of a daughter in law  As the matter stands  that there may be no difference of opinion between my master and you  since you are absolutely determined to live asunder  you in the Asturias  and he in the kingdom of Valencia  he must allow you an annuity of a hundred pistoles  and send me hither every year for the payment  By thus arranging matters  mother and son will be very good friends  with an interval of two hundred leagues between them  The parties concerned fell in at once with the proposal  I paid the first year in advance  and stole out of Oviedo the next morning before dawn  for fear of vying with Saint Stephen in popular favour  Such were the charms of my return to my native place  An admirable lesson this for those successful upstarts  who having gone abroad to make their fortunes  come home to be the purse proud tyrants of their birth place       CH  III     Gil Blas sets out for Valencia  and arrives at Lirias  description of his seat  the particulars of his reception  and the characters of the inhabitants he found there   We took the road for Leon  afterwards that of Palencia  and  continuing our journey by short stages  arrived on the evening of the tenth day at the town of Segorba  whence early on the morrow we repaired to my seat  at the distance of very little more than three leagues  In proportion as we approached nearer  it was amusing to see with what a longing eye my secretary looked at all the estates which lay in our way  to the right and left of the road  Whenever he caught a glimpse of any which bespoke the rank and opulence of its owner  he never missed pointing at it with his finger  and wishing that were the place of our retreat   I know not  my good friend  said I  what idea you have formed of our habitation  but if you have taken it into your head that ours is a magnificent house  with the domain of a great landed proprietor  I warn you in time that you are laying much too flattering an unction to your vanity   If you have no mind to be the dupe of a warm imagination  figure to yourself the little ornamented cottage which Horace fitted up near Tibur in the country of the Sabines  on a small farm  the fee simple of which was given hint by Maecenas  Don Alphonso has made me just such another present  more as a token of affection than for the value of the thing  Then I must expect to see nothing but a dirty hovel  exclaimed Scipio  Bear in mind  replied I  that I have always given you quite an unvarnished description of my place  and now  even at this moment  you may judge for yourself whether I have not stuck to truth and nature in my representations  Just carry your eye along the course of the Guadalaviar  and observe at a little distance from the further bank  near that
