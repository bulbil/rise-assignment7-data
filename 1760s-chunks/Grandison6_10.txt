will be so good as to read these Letters to your daughter Byron  to her Lucy  to Mr  and Mrs  Selby  and to whom else you will think fit to call to the consultation  They will be those  I presume  who already know something of the history of the excellent Clementina  If  on the perusal of them  I may be admitted to pay my respects to Miss Byron  consistently  as I hinted  with her notions and yours of that delicacy by which she was always directed  and at the same time be received with that noble frankness which has distinguished her in my eye above all women but one  Excuse me  madam  I must always put these sister souls upon an equal foot of excellence   then shall I be a happier man than the happiest  Your answer  madam  by pen and ink  will greatly oblige me  and the more  the sooner I can be favoured with it  because  being requested by my friends abroad to set an example to their beloved Clementina  as you will see in more than one of these Letters  I would avoid all punctilio  and let them know  that I had offered myself to Miss Byron  and have not been mortified with absolute denial  if I may be so happy as to be allowed to write so   Thus did this most generous of men prevent  by this reference to the Letters  my grandmamma s heart overflowing to her lips  He should directly  he said  proceed on his journey to London  and was in such haste to be gone  when he had said what he had to say  that it precipitated a little my grandmamma s spirits  But the joy she was filled with  on the occasion  was so great  that she only had a concern upon her  when he was gone  as if something was left by her undone or unsaid  which she thought should have been said and done to oblige him   The Letters he left on the table  were copies of what he wrote from Lyons to the Marquis and Marchioness    25 the Bishop  the General  and Father Marescotti  as also to Lady Ciementina  and her brother  the good Jeronymo  a   That to the Lady cannot be enough admired  for the tenderness  yet for the acquiescence with her will expressed in it  Surely they were born for each other  however it happens  that they are not likely to come together   A Letter from Signor Jeronymo  in answer to his from Lyons  I will mention next  In this—Sir Charles is wished to use his supposed influence upon Lady Clementina  What a hard task upon him   to dissuade her from the thoughts of going into a nunnery and to resolve upon marriage  b    Next is a Letter of Lady Clementina to Sir Charles  complaining tenderly of persecution from her friends  who press her to marry  while she contends to be allowed to take the veil  and applies to Sir Charles for his interest in her behalf   The next is Sir Charles s reply to Lady Clementina   Then follows a Letter from Sir Charles to Signor Jeronymo  I have copied these three last  and inclose them in confidence  c    By these you will see  my dear  that the affair between this excellent man and woman is entirely given up by both  and also in his reply to Signor Jeronymo  that your Harriet is referred to as his next choice  And how can I ever enough value him  for the dignity he has given me  in putting it  as it should seem  in my power to lay an obligation upon him  in making for me my own scruples  and now  lastly  in the method he has taken in the application to my grandmamma  instead of to me  and leaving all to our determination  But thus should the men give dignity  even for their own saken to the women whom they wish to be theirs  Were there more Sir Charles Grandisons  would not even the Female world   26  much better  as I hope it is  than the Male  be amended   My grandmamma  the moment Sir Charles was gone  sent to us  that she had some very agreeable news to surprise us with  and therefore desired the whole family of us  her Byron particularly to attend her at Breakfast  the next morning  We looked upon one another  at the message  and wondered  I was not well  and would have excused myself  but my aunt insisted upon my going  Little did I or any body else think of your brother having visited my grandmamma in person  When she acquainted us that he had  my weakened spirits wanted support  I was obliged to withdraw with Lucy   I thought I could not bear  when I recovered myself  that he should be so near  and not once call in  and enquire after the health of the creature for whom he professed so high an esteem  and even affection  But when  on my return to company  my grandmamma related what passed between them  and the Letters were read  then again were my failing spirits unable to
