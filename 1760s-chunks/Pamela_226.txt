 continued he  you are not to   mind  as you once proposed  what other ladies will say  but to appear as   my wife ought to do  Else it would look as if what you thought of  as   a means to avoid the envy of others of your sex  was a wilful slight   in me  which  I hope  I never shall be guilty of  and I will shew the   world  that I value you as I ought  and as if I had married the first   fortune in the kingdom  And why should it not be so  when I know none of   the first quality that matches you in excellence       He saw I was at a loss for words  and said  I see  my dearest bride  my   spouse  my wife  my Pamela  your grateful confusion  And kissing me  as   I was going to speak  I will stop your dear mouth  said he  You shall   not so much as thank me  for when I have done ten times more than this    I shall but poorly express my love for so much beauty of mind  and   loveliness of person  which thus  said he  and clasped me to his   generous bosom  I can proudly now call my own   O how  my dear parents    can I think of any thing  but redoubled love  joy  and gratitude       And thus generously did he banish from my mind those painful   reflections  and bashful apprehensions  that made me dread to see   him for the first time this day  when I was called to attend him at   breakfast  and made me all ease  composure  and tranquillity       He then  thinking I seemed somewhat thoughtful  proposed a little turn   in the chariot till dinner time  And this was another sweet relief   to me  and he diverted me with twenty agreeable relations  of what   observations he had made in his travels  and gave me the characters of   the ladies and gentlemen in his other neighbourhood  telling me whose   acquaintance he would have me most cultivate  And when I mentioned Lady   Davers with apprehension  he said  To be sure I love my sister dearly    notwithstanding her violent spirit  and I know she loves me  and I can   allow a little for her pride  because I know what my own so lately was    and because she knows not my Pamela  and her excellencies  as I do    But you must not  my dear  forget what belongs to your character  as   my wife  nor meanly stoop to her  though I know you will choose  by   softness  to try to move her to a proper behaviour  But it shall be my   part to see  that you do not yield too much       However  continued he  as I would not publicly declare my marriage here    I hope she won t come near us till we are in Bedfordshire  and then    when she knows we are married  she will keep away  if she is not willing   to be reconciled  for she dares not  surely  come to quarrel with me    when she knows it is done  for that would have a hateful and wicked   appearance  as if she would try to make differences between man and   wife   But we will have no more of this subject  nor talk of any thing    added he  that shall give concern to my dearest  And so he changed the   talk to a more pleasing subject  and said the kindest and most soothing   things in the world       When we came home  which was about dinner time  he was the same   obliging  kind gentleman  and  in short  is studious to shew  on every   occasion  his generous affection to me  And  after dinner  he told   me  he had already written to his draper  in town  to provide him new   liveries  and to his late mother s mercer  to send him down patterns of   the most fashionable silks  for my choice  I told him  I was unable to   express my gratitude for his favours and generosity  And as he knew best   what befitted his own rank and condition  I would wholly remit myself   to his good pleasure  But  by all his repeated bounties to me  of so   extraordinary a nature  I could not but look forward with awe upon the   condition to which he had exalted me  and now I feared I should hardly   be able to act up to it in such a manner as should justify the choice he   had condescended to make  But that  I hoped  I should have not only his
