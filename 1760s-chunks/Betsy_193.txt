former bashfulness  from   which she had a little recovered herself  and again deprived her of the   power of speech        You give up the point  then  my angel   cried he  perceiving she was   silent   and I am glad you do  for had you continued to prohibit my   expatiating on these matters  which made me your adorer  I must have   maintained the argument even against your lovely self  to whom I shall   for ever yield in all things else        After this he fell  insensibly as it were  into some discourse   concerning the divine ordinance of marriage  and then proceeded to give   her the most amiable picture that words could form of that state  when   two persons of virtue  honour  and good sense  were by love and law   united  and found themselves equally bound by duty and inclination to   promote each other s happiness       There are some ladies who listen very contentedly to the most warm and   amorous addresses that can be made to them  yet will not suffer the   least word of marriage till after a long and tedious preparation is made   for a sound which they pretend to think so dreadful  These  no doubt    will say  that Mr  Trueworth went too far for a lover on the first   declaration of his passion  but he was emboldened to act in the manner   he did by the brother of his mistress  and had the satisfaction to   perceive she was not offended at it  she had a great share of solid   understanding  was an enemy to all sorts of affectation  and as she knew   the end proposed by his courtship was marriage  saw no reason why he   should be fearful of mentioning it to her  and though her modesty would   not permit her to take much part in a conversation of this nature  yet   she was too artless  and indeed  too sincere  to counterfeit a   displeasure which she did not feel                CHAPTER VIII       Is more full of business than entertainment          While Mr  Trueworth was thus prosecuting a suit  which every time he saw   the lovely Harriot redoubled his impatience to accomplish  Mr  Francis   Thoughtless had been twice at his lodgings without finding him at home    but on that gentleman s leaving his name the second time  and saying he   would come again the next morning  the other thought himself under an   indispensible necessity of staying to receive his visit       The meeting of these two was extremely civil and polite  but far from   that cordial familiarity which used to pass between them  especially on   the side of Mr  Francis  After Mr  Trueworth had congratulated him on   the recovery of his health  and coming to town  they fell into some   discourse on ordinary affairs  without the least mentioning of Miss   Betsy  by either party  for a considerable time  till her brother    growing a little impatient that the other should say nothing to him on   an affair in which he had made him his confidant  and which he had taken   so much pains to forward  said to him  with an air  partly gay  and   partly serious   I was surprized on my arrival to be told  that a   passion so violent as that you pretended for my sister  should all on a   sudden vanish  and that a thing which I once thought so near being   concluded  was entirely broken off         Things of that nature   replied Mr  Trueworth  coldly   are never   concluded till accomplished  accidents sometimes intervene to separate   persons who have seemed most likely to be united for ever  which    indeed  never was the case between me and that lady         Yet  Sir   rejoined the other  a little irritated at his manner of   speaking   I think  that when a gentleman has made his addresses to a   young lady of family and character for any length of time  and in the   publick manner you did  some cause ought to be assigned for his   deserting her         I am under no obligation   said Mr  Trueworth  very gloomily   to give   an account of my behaviour to any one whatever  but  in consideration of   our friendship  and the love I once had for your sister  I shall make no   scruple to tell you  that a woman of her humour would suit but ill with   a man of mine  as to any farther eclaircissement of this affair  it is
