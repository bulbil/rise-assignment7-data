tis more prudent to go with my father  I love prudence  and will therefore send for Mademoiselle Clairaut to be Rivers s belle   Yours   A  FERMOR     LETTER LXXIX   79   To Miss FERMOR   YOU are a provoking chit  and I will go with Rivers  Your father may attend Madame Villiers  who you know will naturally take it ill if she is not of our party  We can ask Mademoiselle Clairaut another time       Adieu  Your  EMILY MONTAGUE     LETTER LXXX   80   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Silleri  Feb  25   THOSE who have heard no more of a Canadian winter than what regards the intenseness of its cold  must suppose it a very joyless season   tis  I assure you  quite otherwise  there are indeed some days here of the severity of which those who were never out of England can form no conception  but those days seldom exceed a dozen in a whole winter  nor do they come in succession  but at intermediate periods  as the winds set in from the North West  which  coming some hundred leagues  from frozen lakes and rivers  over woods and mountains covered with snow  would be insupportable  were it not for the furs with which the country abounds  in such variety and plenty as to be within the reach of all its inhabitants       Thus defended  the British belles set the winter of Canada at defiance  and the season of which you seem to entertain such terrible ideas  is that of the utmost chearfulness and festivity       But what particularly pleases me is  there is no place where women are of such importance  not one of the sex  who has the least share of attractions  is without a levee of beaux interceding for the honor of attending her on some party  of which every day produces three or four       I am just returned from one of the most agreable jaunts imagination can paint  to the island of Orleans  by the falls of Montmorenci  the latter is almost nine miles distant  across the great bason of Quebec  but as we are obliged to reach it in winter by the waving line  our direct road being intercepted by the inequalities of the ice  it is now perhaps a third more  You will possibly suppose a ride of this kind must want one of the greatest essentials to entertainment  that of variety  and imagine it only one dull whirl over an unvaried plain of snow  on the contrary  my dear  we pass hills and mountains of ice in the trifling space of these few miles  The bason of Quebec is formed by the conflux of the rivers St  Charles and Montmorenci with the great river St  Lawrence  the rapidity of whose flood tide  as these rivers are gradually seized by the frost  breaks up the ice  and drives it back in heaps  till it forms ridges of transparent rock to an height that is astonishing  and of a strength which bids defiance to the utmost rage of the most furiously rushing tide       This circumstance makes this little journey more pleasing than you can possibly conceive  the serene blue sky above  the dazling brightness of the sun  and the colors from the refraction of its rays on the transparent part of these ridges of ice  the winding course these oblige you to make  the sudden disappearing of a train of fifteen or twenty carrioles  as these ridges intervene  which again discover themselves on your rising to the top of the frozen mount  the tremendous appearance both of the ascent and descent  which however are not attended with the least danger  all together give a grandeur and variety to the scene  which almost rise to enchantment       Your dull foggy climate affords nothing that can give you the least idea of our frost pieces in Canada  nor can you form any notion of our amusements  of the agreableness of a covered carriole  with a sprightly fellow  rendered more sprightly by the keen air and romantic scene about him  to say nothing of the fair lady at his side       Even an overturning has nothing alarming in it  you are laid gently down on a soft bed of snow  without the least danger of any kind  and an accident of this sort only gives a pretty fellow occasion to vary the style of his civilities  and shew a greater degree of attention       But it is almost time to come to Montmorenci  to avoid  however  fatiguing you or myself  I shall refer the rest of our tour to another letter  which will probably accompany this  my meaning is  that two moderate letters are vastly better than one long one  in which sentiment I know you agree with      Yours    A  FERMOR     LETTER LXXXI   81   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Silleri  Feb  25  Afternoon   SO  my dear  as I was saying  this same ride to Montmorenci where was I  Lucy  I forget  O  I believe pretty near the mouth of the bay  embosomed in which lies the lovely cascade of which I am to
