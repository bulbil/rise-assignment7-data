all this while with admiration  all   that seemed lovely in her  when he knew no more of her than that she was   young and beautiful  was now heightened in his eyes almost to divine  by   that virtuous pride which shewed him some part of her more charming   mind  What he extremely liked before  he now almost adored  and having    by the loose manner in which the count had mentioned these two English   ladies  imagined them women of not over rigid principles  now finding   his mistake  at least as concerning one of them  was so much ashamed and   angry with himself for having been the cause of that disorder he was   witness of  that he for some moments was equally at a loss to appease    as she who felt was to express it       But being the first that recovered presence of mind  madame  I beseech   you  said he  involve not the innocent with the guilty   I acknowledge   you have reason to resent the boldness of the count  but I am no   otherwise a sharer in his crime than in reporting it  and if you knew   the pain it gave my heart while I complied with the promise I was   unhappily betrayed into  I am sure you would forgive the misdemeanor of   my tongue       Sir  answered she  I can easily forgive the slight opinion one so much a   stranger to me as yourself may have of me  but monsieur the count has   been a constant visitor to the lady I am with  ever since our arrival at   Venice  and am very certain he never found any thing in my behaviour to   him or any other person  which could justly encourage him to send me   such a message   a message  indeed  equally affrontive to himself  since   it shews him a composition of arrogance  vanity  perfidy  and every   thing that is contemptible in man   This  sir  is the reply I send him    and desire you to tell him withal  that if he persists in giving me any   farther trouble of this nature  I shall let him know my sense of it in   the presence of Melanthe       Monsieur du Plessis then assured her he would be no less exact in   delivering what she said  than he had been in the observance of his   promise to the other  and conjured her to believe he should do it with   infinite more satisfaction  He then made use of so many arguments to   prove  that a man of honour ought not to falsify his word  tho  given to   an unworthy person  that she was at last won to forgive his having   undertaken to mention any thing to her of the nature he had done       Indeed  the agitations she had been in were more owing to the vexation   that monsieur du Plessis was the person employed  than that the count   had the boldness to apply to her in this manner  but the submission she   found herself treated with by the former  convincing her that he had   sentiments very different from those the other had entertained of her    rendered her more easy  and she not only forgave his share in the   business which had brought him there  but also permitted him to repeat   his visits  on condition he never gave her any cause to suspect the mean   opinion the count had of her conduct had any influence on him             CHAP  XIII        Louisa finds herself very much embarrassed by Melanthe s imprudent   behaviour  Monsieur du Plessis declares an honourable passion for her    her sentiments and way of acting on that occasion        After the departure of monsieur du Plessis  Louisa fell into a serious   consideration of what had passed between them  not all the regard  which   she could not hinder herself from feeling for that young gentleman  nor   the pleasure she took in reflecting on the respect he paid her  made her   unmindful of what she owed Melanthe  the many obligations she had   received from her  and the friendship she had for her in return  made   her think she ought to acquaint her with the baseness of the count de   Bellfleur  in order to prevent an affection which she found she had   already too much indulged from influencing her to grant him any farther   favours  but this she knew was a very critical point to manage  and was   not without some apprehensions  which afterward she experienced were but   too well grounded  that when that lady found herself obliged to hate the   man she took pleasure in loving  she would also hate the woman who was   the innocent occasion of it  Few in the circumstances Louisa was
