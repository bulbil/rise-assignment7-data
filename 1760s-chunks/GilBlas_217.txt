with a knight  who had other motives for officiating as the guardian of distressed damsels  besides the honour of chivalry  I saw at once that he reckoned much on my gratitude  and still more on my distress  Nevertheless  though these two pleas were almost equally eloquent in his favour  I rejected his addresses with disdain  The reason was  that there were two advocates still more eloquent on the side of a refusal  a certainty that he was disagreeable  and a strong suspicion that he was poor  But when he returned to the charge  and offered to say the grace of matrimony before he fell to  proving to me at the same time  by the undeniable evidence of cash in hand  that his stewardship had enabled him to live in clover for a long time to come  the truth must come out in spite of blushes  my heart was softened  and my ears unstopped  I was dazzled by the gold and jewels which he laid out in burning row before me  and became a living monument in my own person  that miraculous transformations are effected by the power of pelf  as well as by the wand of love  My Biscayan became  by little and little  quite another sort of man in my eyes  His tall body and bare bones were plumped up into a shapely and commanding figure  his cadaverous complexion was improved into a manly brown  even that look  as if butter would not melt in his mouth  was no longer hypocrisy  but a staid and decent aspect  Having made these discoveries  I accepted his hand without any material abhorrence  and he plighted the usual vows in all due form  After this  like a good wife  I kept the spirit of contradiction as much as possible under the hatches  We resumed our journey  and Coimbra soon received a new family within its walls  My husband stocked my wardrobe as became my sex and station  making me a present of several diamonds  among which I fixed my eye on that of Don Felix Moldonado  There were no further documents wanting to give a shrewd guess whence came all the precious stones I had seen  and to be morally certain that I had not married a troublesomely nice observer of the eighth article in the decalogue  Yet  considering myself as the main spring of all his little deviations from the strict law of propriety  it was not for me to judge harshly on that point A woman can always find a palliation for the misdeeds which are set in motion by the power of her own beauty  But for that  he certainly would have ranked no higher than one of the wicked in my estimation   I had no great reason to complain of him for two or three months  His attentions were always polite and kind  amounting apparently to a sincere and tender affection  But no such thing  These proofs of wedded love  this worshipping with the body  and endowing with the worldly goods  were all but a copy of his countenance  for the cheating fellow meant  as men serve a cucumber  to throw me away on the first opportunity  One morning  at my return from mass  I found nothing at home but the bare walls  the moveables  not excepting my own apparel  every stick and every thread  had been carried off  Zendono and his faithful servant had taken their measures so adroitly  that in less than an hour the house had been completely gutted  so that with nothing but the gown upon my back  and Don Felix s ring  as good luck would have it  on my finger  here stood I  like another Ariadne  abandoned by the ungrateful rifler of my effects as well as of my charms  But you may take my word for it  I did not beguile the sense of my misfortunes in tragedy  elegy  scene individable  or poem unlimited  I rather fell upon my knees  and blessed my guardian angel  for having delivered me from a rascal who must sooner or later fall into the hands of justice  The time we had passed together I considered in the light of a dead loss  and my spirits were all on the alert to make up for it  If I had been inclined to stay in Portugal  as a hanger on to some woman of fashion  I should have found no difficulty in suiting myself  but whether it was patriotism  or some astrological conjunction  preparing a better fortune for me under the influence of the planets  my whole heart was bent on getting back into Spain  I applied to a jeweller  who valued my diamond and gave me cash for it  and then took my departure with an old Spanish lady who was going to Seville in a post chaise   This lady  whose name was Dorothea  had been to see a relation settled at Coimbra  and was on her return to Seville  where she lived  There was such a sympathy between us  as made us fast friends on the very first day of our acquaintance  and the attachment grew so close while we travelled together  that the lady insisted  at our journey s end  on my making her house my home  I had no reason to repent having formed such a connection  Never was there a woman
