the best   And then Mr  Grandison  as he told the sisters  ridiculed the unhappy woman on her grief  and mortified behaviour  when she was obliged to quit the house  where  he said  she had reigned so long Lady Paramount   Sir Charles ask d  If they had search d for or found a will   Mr  Grandison said  They had look d in every probable place  but found none   What I think to do  cousin  said Sir Charles  is  to interr the venerable remains  I must always speak in this dialect  Sir  with those of my mother  This I know  was his desire  I will have an elegant  but not sumptuous monument erected to the memory of both  with a modest inscription  that shall rather be matter of instruction to the living  than a panegyric on the departed  The funeral shall be decent  but not ostentatious  The difference in the expence shall be privately applied to relieve or assist distressed   204 housekeepers  or some of my fathers poor tenants  who have large families  and have not been wanting in their honest endeavours to maintain them  My sisters  I hope  will not think themselves neglected  if I spare them the pain of conferring with them on a subject that must afflict them   These sentiments were new to Mr  Grandison  He told the sisters what Sir Charles had said  I did not contradict him  said he  But as Sir Thomas had so magnificent a mind  and always lived up to it  I should have thought he ought to have been honoured with a magnificent funeral  But I cannot but own  however  that what your brother said  had something great and noble in it   The two Ladies  on their brother s hinting his intentions to them  acquiesced with all he proposed  and all was performed according to directions which he himself wrote down  He allowed of his sisters compliance with the fashion  But he in person saw performed  with equal piety and decorum  the last offices   Sir Charles is noted for his great dexterity in business  Were I to express myself in the language of Miss Grandison  I should say  that a sun beam is not more penetrating  He goes to the bottom of an affair at once  and wants but to hear both sides of a question to determine  and when he determines  his execution can only be staid by perverse accidents  that lie out of the reach of human foresight  And when he finds that to be the case  yet the thing right to be done  he changes his methods of proceeding  as a man would do  who finding himself unable to pursue his journey by one road  because of a sudden inundation  takes another  which  tho a little about  carries him home in safety   As soon as the solemnity was over  Sir Charles  leaving every thing at Grandisor hall as he found it  and the seals unbroken  came to town  and  in the   205 presence of his sisters  broke the seals that had been affixed to the cabinets and escrutoires in the house there   The Ladies told him  that their bills were ready for his inspection  and that they had a balance in their hands  His answer was  I hope my dear sisters  we shall have but one interest  It is for you to make the demands upon me  and for me to answer them as I shall be able   He made memorandums of the contents of many papers  with surprising expedition  and then locked them up  He found a bank note of 350l  in the private drawer of one of the bureaus in the apartment that was his father s  Be pleased  my sisters  said he  presenting it to Miss Caroline  to add that to the money in your hands  to answer family calls   He then went with his sisters to the house in Essex  When there  he told them  it was necessary for Mrs  Oldham  who had lodgings at a neighbouring farmhouse  to be present at the breaking of the seals  as she had hers affixed  and accordingly sent for her   They desired to be excused seeing her   It will be a concern to me  said he  to see her  But what ought to be done  must be done   The poor woman came with fear and trembling   You will not Lucy  be displeased with an account of what passed on the occasion  I was very attentive to it  as given by Miss Grandison  whose memory was aided by the recollection of her sister  And  as I am used to aim at giving affecting scenes in the very words of the persons  as near as I can  to make them appear lively and natural  you will expect  that I should attempt to do so in this case   Sir Charles  not expecting Mrs Oldham would be there so soon  was in his stud with his groom and coachman  looking upon his horses  For there were most of the hunters and racers  some of the finest beasts in the kingdom     206 By mistake
