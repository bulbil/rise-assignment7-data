     The object of which I am speaking has all the American magnificence       The ice before the town  or  to speak in the Canadian stile  the bridge  being of a thickness not less than five feet  a league in length  and more than a mile broad  resists for a long time the rapid tide that attempts to force it from the banks       We are prepared by many previous circumstances to expect something extraordinary in this event  if I may so call it  every increase of heat in the weather for near a month before the ice leaves the banks  every warm day gives you terror for those you see venturing to pass it in carrioles  yet one frosty night makes it again so strong  that even the ladies  and the timid amongst them  still venture themselves over in parties of pleasure  though greatly alarmed at their return  if a few hours of uncommon warmth intervenes       But  during the last fortnight  the alarm grows indeed a very serious one  the eye can distinguish  even at a considerable distance  that the ice is softened and detached from the banks  and you dread every step being death to those who have still the temerity to pass it  which they will continue always to do till one or more pay their rashness with their lives       From the time the ice is no longer a bridge on which you see crowds driving with such vivacity on business or pleasure  every one is looking eagerly for its breaking away  to remove the bar to the continually wished and expected event  of the arrival of ships from that world from whence we have seemed so long in a manner excluded       The hour is come  I have been with a crowd of both sexes  and all ranks  hailing the propitious moment  our situation  on the top of Cape Diamond  gave us a prospect some leagues above and below the town  above Cape Diamond the river was open  it was so below Point Levi  the rapidity of the current having forced a passage for the water under the transparent bridge  which for more than a league continued firm       We stood waiting with all the eagerness of expectation  the tide came rushing with an amazing impetuosity  the bridge seemed to shake  yet resisted the force of the waters  the tide recoiled  it made a pause  it stood still  it returned with redoubled fury  the immense mass of ice gave way       A vast plain appeared in motion  it advanced with solemn and majestic pace  the points of land on the banks of the river for a few moments stopped its progress  but the immense weight of so prodigious a body  carried along by a rapid current  bore down all opposition with a force irresistible       There is no describing how beautiful the opening river appears  every moment gaining on the sight  till  in a time less than can possibly be imagined  the ice passing Point Levi  is hid in one moment by the projecting land  and all is once more a clear plain before you  giving at once the pleasing  but unconnected  ideas of that direct intercourse with Europe from which we have been so many months excluded  and of the earth s again opening her fertile bosom  to feast our eyes and imagination with her various verdant and flowery productions       I am afraid I have conveyed a very inadequate idea of the scene which has just passed before me  it however struck me so strongly  that it was impossible for me not to attempt it       If my painting has the least resemblance to the original  your Lordship will agree with me  that the very vicissitudes of season here partake of the sublimity which so strongly characterizes the country       The changes of season in England  being slow and gradual  are but faintly felt  but being here sudden  instant  violent  afford to the mind  with the lively pleasure arising from meer change  the very high additional one of its being accompanied with grandeur  I have the honor to be       My Lord   Your Lordship s   c   WILLIAM FERMOR     LETTER CXXXII   132   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   April 22   CERTAINLY  my dear  you are so far right  a nun may be in many respects a less unhappy being than some women who continue in the world  her situation is  I allow  paradise to that of a married woman  of sensibility and honor  who dislikes her husband       The cruelty therefore of some parents here  who sacrifice their children to avarice  in forcing or seducing them into convents  would appear more striking  if we did not see too many in England guilty of the same inhumanity  though in a different manner  by marrying them against their inclination       Your letter reminds me of what a French married lady here said to me on this very subject  I was exclaiming violently against convents  and particularly urging  what I thought unanswerable  the extreme hardship of one circumstance  that  however unhappy the state was found on trial  there was no retreat  that it
