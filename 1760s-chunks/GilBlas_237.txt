chamber was blockaded by esquires  gentlemen  and various officers of the household  They were all as fine as possible  but with so whimsical an assortment of features  that you might have taken them for a cluster of monkeys dressed up to satirize the Spanish fashions  Do what you will  there is a certain class of men and women in nature  whom no art can trick out into anything human   At the very name of Don Fabricio  a lane was formed for my patron  and I followed in the rear  The count was in his dressing gown  sitting on a sofa and taking his chocolate  We made our obeisance in the most respectful manner  while an inclination of the head on his part  accompanied with a condescending smile  won my heart at once  It is very wonderful  and yet very common  how the most trifling notice from the great penetrates the very soul of those who are not accustomed to it  They must have behaved like fiends  before their behaviour will be complained of   After taking his chocolate  he recreated himself with the humours of a large ape  which underwent the name of Cupid  why the ape was made a god  or the god likened to an ape  the parties concerned can best answer  the only point of resemblance seemed to be mischief  At all events  this hairy brat of the sylvan Venus had so gambolled himself into his master s good graces  had established such a character for wit and humour  that the life of society was extinguished in his absence  As for Nunez and myself  though we had a better turn for drollery  we were cunning enough to chime in with the prevailing taste  The Sicilian was highly delighted with this  and tore himself away for a moment from his favourite pastime  just to tell me  My friend  you have only to say whether you choose to be one of my secretaries  If the situation suits you  the salary is two hundred pistoles a year  If Don Fabricio gives you a character  that is enough  Yes  my lord  cried Nunez  I am not such a cowardly fellow as Plato  who introduced one of his friends to Dionysius the tyrant  and then was afraid to back his own recommendation  But I have no anxiety about being reproached on that head   I thanked the poet of the Asturias with a low bow  for having so much better an opinion of me than Plato had of his friend  Then addressing my patron  I assured him of my zeal and fidelity  No sooner did this good nobleman perceive his proposal to be acceptable  then he rang for his steward  and after talking to him apart  said to me  Gil Blas  I will explain the nature of your post hereafter  Meanwhile  you have only to follow that right hand man of mine  he has his orders how to bestow you  I immediately retreated  leaving Fabricio behind with the Count and Cupid   The steward  who came from Messina  and proved by all his actions that he came thence  led the way to his own room  overwhelming me all the while with the kindness of his reception  He sent the tailor who lived upon the skirts of the household  and ordered him to make me out of hand a suit of equal magnificence with those of the principal officers  The tailor took my measure and withdrew  As to lodging  said the native of Messina  I know a room which will just suit you  But stay  Have you breakfasted  I answered in the negative  Oh  poor shamefaced youth  replied he  why did not you say so  Come this way  I will introduce you where  thank heaven  you have only to ask and have   So saying  he led me down into the buttery  where we found the clerk of the kitchen  who was a Neapolitan  and of course a complete match for his neighbour on the other side of the water  It might be said of this pair that they were formed to meet by nature  This honest clerk of the kitchen was doing justice to his trade by cramming himself and five or six hangers on with ham  tongue  sausages  and other savoury compositions  which  besides their own relish  possess the merit of engendering thirst  we made common cause with these jolly fellows  and helped them to toss off some of my lord the count s best wines  While these things were going on in the buttery  kindred exploits were performing in the kitchen  The cook too was regaling three or four tradesmen of his acquaintance  who liked good wine as well as ourselves  nor disdained to stuff their craws with meat pasties and game  the very scullions were at free quarters  and filched whatever they pleased  I fancied myself in a house given up to plunder  and yet what I saw was comparatively fair and honest  These little festivities were laughing matters  but the private transactions of the family were very serious       CH  XV     The employment of Gil Blas in Don Galiano s household   I WENT away to fetch my moveables to my new residence  On my return the count was at
