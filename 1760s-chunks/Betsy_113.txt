company he was in  after some little   time being passed in discoursing on ordinary affairs  Miss Forward took   Miss Betsy into the next room to return the money she had been so kind   to lend her at Mrs  Nightshade s  and told her  she had much to say to   her  but could not be so rude to leave the gentlemen for any long time    While they were absent  which indeed was not above half a minute   This   is a delicious girl   said Sir Bazil to Mr  Trueworth   i faith    Charles  you will have the best of the market to night   What reply Mr    Trueworth would have made is uncertain  the ladies returned that   instant  and the conversation became extremely sprightly  though  on Sir   Bazil s part  sometimes interspersed with expressions not altogether   consistent with that decorum he would have observed towards women of   reputation       Miss Betsy  far from thinking any ill herself  took every thing as well   meant  and replied to whatever was uttered by this gay young gentleman    with a freedom which  to those who knew her not perfectly  might justly   render liable to censure  Mr  Trueworth would fain have taken some   share  if possible  in this conversation  in order to conceal the   perplexity of his thoughts  but all his endeavours were ineffectual  and   though his words were sometimes gay  the tone with which he spoke them   plainly shewed  that his heart was very far from corresponding with his   expressions       Sir Bazil having ordered a handsome supper  Miss Betsy staid till it was   over  and then rose up  and took her leave  saying  she was obliged to   go home and write some letters  As none of them had any equipage there    a hackney coach was ordered to be called  and Mr  Trueworth offering to   accompany her  Sir Bazil  on waiting on them down stairs  said to him   some merry things on the occasion  which  though Miss Betsy did not   comprehend  her lover understood the meaning of but too well for his   peace of mind                CHAPTER IX       Is yet more interesting than the former          Any one may judge what a heart  possessed of so sincere and honourable a   flame as that of Mr  Trueworth s  must feel  to see the beloved object   so intimate with a common prostitute  it shall suffice  therefore  to   say  that his anxieties were such as prevented him from being able to   recover himself enough to speak to Miss Betsy on that subject as he   would do  He forbore mentioning it at all  and said very little to her   on any other  while they were in the coach  and  having seen her safe   into Mr  Goodman s house  took his leave  and went home  where he passed   a night of more vexation than he ever had before experienced       Fain would he have found some excuse for Miss Betsy s conduct in this   point  fain would he have believed her as innocent as she was lovely    but could not tell how to conceive there was a possibility for true   virtue to take delight in the company of vice  but  were there even such   a thing in nature  the shew of encouraging an infamous action he knew   not how to brook in a woman he intended to make his wife       He now acknowledged the justice of his aunt s remonstrances  and  by   what the levity of Miss Betsy made him at present endure  foresaw what   his honour and peace of mind must hereafter continually endure if he   should once become a husband  Never were thoughts so divided  so   fluctuating  as his  His good understanding  and jealousy of honour    convinced him there could be no lasting happiness with a person of Miss   Betsy s temper  but then the passion he had for her  flattered him with   the hopes  that as all the faults she was guilty of  sprung rather from   want of consideration than design  she might be reasoned out of them    when once he had gained so far upon her affections  as to find he might   take the liberty of painting them to her in their proper colours       He often asked himself the question  whether he could be able to break   with her or not  and finding  by the pangs which the very idea of an   utter separation inflicted on him  that he could not  had no other   measures to take than to submit with patience  to appear satisfied with   every
