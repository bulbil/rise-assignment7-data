archbishop  besides that  there are three times as many servants as are necessary  and consequently you are put to an expense at once enormous and useless   Had you accepted the annuity of two thousand ducats which we offered you at Madrid  said Don Caesar  we should have thought it enough to give you the mansion furnished as it is  but you know  you refused it  and we felt it but right to do what we have done as an equivalent  Your bounty has been too lavish  answered I  the gift of the estate was the utmost limit to which it should have been extended  and that was more than sufficient to crown my largest wishes  But to say nothing about what it has cost you to keep up so great and expensive an establishment  I declare to you most solemnly that these people stand in my way  and are a great annoyance  In one word  gentlemen  either take back your boon  or give me leave to enjoy it in my own way  I pronounced these last words so much as if I was in earnest  that the father and son  not meaning to lay me under any unpleasant restraint  at length gave me their permission to manage my household as it should seem expedient to my better judgment   I was thanking them very kindly for having granted me that privilege  without which a dukedom would have been but splendid slavery  when Don Alphonso interrupted me by saying  My dear Gil Blas  I will introduce you to a lady who will be extremely happy to see you  Thus preparing me for the interview  he took me by the hand and led the way to Seraphina s apartment  who set up a scream of joy on recognizing me  Madam  said the governor  I flatter myself that the visit of our friend Santillane at Valencia is not less acceptable to you than myself  On that head  answered she  he may rest confidently assured  time has not obliterated the remembrance of the service which he once rendered me and to that must be added a new debt of gratitude incurred on the score of your obligations  I told the governor s lady that I was already too well requited for the danger which I had shared in common with her deliverers  in exposing my life for her sake  compliments to the like effect were bandied about for some time on both sides  when Don Alphonso motioned to quit Seraphina s room  We then went back to Don Caesar  whom we found in the saloon with a fashionable party  who were come to dinner   All these gentleman were introduced  and paid their compliments to me in the politest manner  nor did their attentions relax in assiduity  when Don Caesar told them that I had been one of the Duke of Lerma s principal secretaries  In all likelihood several of them might not be unacquainted that Don Alphonso had been promoted to the government of Valencia by my interest  for political secrets are seldom kept  However that might be  while we were at table  the conversation principally turned on the new cardinal  Some of the company either were  or affected to be  his unqualified admirers  while others allowed his merit upon the whole  but thought it had been rather overrated  I plainly saw through their design of drawing me on to enlarge on the subject of his eminence  and to gratify their taste for scandal with court anecdotes at his expense  I could have been well enough pleased to have delivered my real sentiments on his character  but I kept my tongue within my teeth  and thereby passed in the estimation of the guests for a close  confidential  politic  trustworthy young statesman   The party respectively retired home after dinner to take their usual nap  what Don Caesar and his son  yielding to a similar inclination  shut themselves up in their apartments   For my own part  full of impatience to see a town which I had so often heard extolled for its beauty  I went out of the governor s palace with the intention of walking through the streets  At the gate a man accosted me with the following address  Will Signor de Santillane allow me to take the liberty of paying my respects to him  I asked him who and what he was  I am Don Caesar s valet de  chambre  answered he  but was one of his ordinary footmen during your stewardship  I used to make my court to you every morning  and you used to take a great deal of notice of me  I regularly gave you intelligence of what was passing in the house  Do you recollect my apprising you one day that the village surgeon of Leyva was privately admitted into Dame Lorenza Sephora s bedchamber  It is a circumstance which I have by no means forgotten  replied I  But now that we are talking of that formidable duenna  what is become of her  Alas  resumed he  the poor creature moped and dwindled after your departure  and at length gave up the ghost  more to the grief of Seraphina than of Don Alphonso  who seemed to consider her death as no great evil   Don Caesar s valet de chambre  having thus acquainted me with Sephora s melancholy end  made an humble apology for having presumed to stop
