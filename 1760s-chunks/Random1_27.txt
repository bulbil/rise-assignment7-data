the floor scratching his head  with a look testifying the utmost astonishment  at the concourse of apparitions that surrounded him —This honest gentleman was  it seems  a recruiting serjeant  who having listed two country fellows over night  dreamed they had mutinied  and threatened to murder him and the drummer who was along him —This made such an impression on his imagination  that he got up in his sleep  and expressed himself as above —When our apprehension of danger vanished  the company beheld one another with great surprize and mirth  but what attracted the notice of every one  was our landlady with nothing on her but her shift and a large pair of buckskin breeches with the backside before  which she had slipt on in the hurry  and her husband with her petticoat about his shoulders  one had wrapt himself in a blanket  another was covered with a sheet  and the drummer who had given his only shirt to be washed  appeared in querpo with the bolster rolled about his middle —When this affair was discussed  every body retired to his own apartment  the serjeant slipt into bed  and my companion and I slept without any further disturbance till the morning  when we got up  went to breakfast  paid our reckoning  and set forward in expectation of overtaking the waggon  in which  however  we were disappointed that day  As we   69 exerted ourselves more than usual  I found myself quite spent with fatigue  when we entered a small village in the twilight  We enquired for a publick house  and were directed to one of a very sorry appearance  At our entrance the landlord  who seemed to be a venerable old man  with long grey hair  rose from a table placed by a large fire in a very neat paved kitchin  and with a chearful countenance accosted us in these words    Salvete Pueri—ingredimini  —  I was not a little pleased to hear our host speak Latin  because I was in hopes of recommending myself to him by my knowledge in that language  I therefore answered without hesitation —Dissolve frigus  ligna super foco —large reponens —I had no sooner pronounced these words  than the old gentleman runing towards me  shook me by the hand  crying    —Fili mi dilectissime  unde venis —a superis  ni fallor  —  in short  finding we were both read in the classicks  he did not know how to testify his regard  but ordered his daughter  a jolly rosycheeked damsel  who was his sole domestic  to bring us a bottle of his quadrimum —repeating from Horace at the same time    Deprome quadrimum sabinâ  O thaliarche  merum diotâ    This quadrimum was excellent ale of his own brewing  of which he told us he had always an amphora four years old  for the use of himself and friends —In the course of our conversation  which was interlarded with scraps of Latin  we understood that this facetious person was a school master  whose income being small  he was fain to keep a glass of good liquor for the entertainment of passengers  by which he made shift to make the two ends of the year meet —   I am this day  said he  the happiest old fellow in his majesty s   70 dominions —My wife  rest her soul  is in heaven  My daughter is to be married next week —but the two chief pleasures of my life are these  pointing to the bottle and a large edition of Horace that lay one the table   I am old   tis true —what then  the more reason I should enjoy the small share of life that remains  as my friend Flaccus advises —Tu ne quaesieris scire  nefas   Quem  mihi quem tibi finem dii dederint—Carpe diem quam minimum credula postero  —  As he was very inquisitive about our affairs  we made no scruple of acquainting him with our situation  which when he had learned  he enriched us with advices how to behave in the world  telling us that he was no stranger to the deceits of mankind —In the mean time he ordered his daughter to lay a fowl to the fire for supper  for he was resolved this night to regale his friends—permittens divis caetera —While our entertainment was preparing  our host recounted the adventures of his own life  which  as they contain nothing remarkable  I forbear to rehearse  When we had fared sumptuously and drank several bottles of his quadrimum  I expressed a desire of going to rest  which was with some difficulty complied with  after he had informed us that we should overtake the waggon by noon next day  and that there was room enough in it for half a dozen  there being only four passengers as yet in that convenience —Before my comrade and I fell asleep we had some conversation about the good humour of our landlord  which gave Strap such an idea of his benevolence  that he was positive we should pay nothing for our lodging and entertainment —   Don t you observe  said he    71 that he has conceived a particular affection for us —nay  even treated us at supper with extraordinary fare  which  to be sure  we should not of ourselves  have called for  —  I was partly of Strap s opinion
