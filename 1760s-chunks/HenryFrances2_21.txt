taller  for Death  in the Philosophy of a Man  or the Hope of a Christian  is to be considered  not as a Change of our State  but an Improvement of it  However  I will indulge your Tenderness so far  as to speak no more upon this Head  but am pleased to find I am even with you  for some unkind Hints  much stronger than mine  upon this Subject  in one of your late Letters   I have been to see the large Manufacture at —  as I have engaged in the same  and it has given me great Satisfaction  though it would make any one  of less Spirit than myself  despair of bringing so vast a Work to Perfection  from Page  78 the complexed Machinery  various Business  intense Application  and large Sums of Money  and Credit  which are necessary to carry it on  yet  believe me  that every Difficulty  which occurred  has but strengthened my Resolution to pursue it  It would surprise and startle your Philosophy  at the same Time  to see so many different Machines performing the Parts of rational Agents  and requiring no farther Assistance from Man  than to set them in Motion  and to preserve their Courses regular  which is no more than what often Man from Man requires  as Patients from Physicians  Nay  some of them  like a Person in Health  perform their Parts by the mere Help of the Elements only  and  if the sole Difference between these and Animals be  that the first regularly labours to pursue the Design of it s Formation  while the other  through Caprice  is capable of disappointing the Ends of it s Creation  I do not think that living Creatures have much to boast of  in the Superiority of their Mechanism  Man  indeed  as exercised in the Contemplation of Truth  Beauty  Harmony  and Order  and employed in the Practice of Virtue  Morality  and Religion  is  in Reality  a noble and exalted Creature  but the many headed Monster  the vulgar Herd  who are insensible to these great Advantages  I take to be a more imperfect Instrument  than a Windmill or a Loom   Adieu  Adieu   Page  79  LETTER CCVII   Dear FANNY   I AM just returned from my Expedition to Scotland  and  to give you my Opinion of it  I need only say  that  since I was obliged to go  I am glad it is over   You cannot imagine  in what Light every thing  both at Bed and Board  appeared to me  who have been used  all my Life  to travel through the best Roads in England  for  though I am no great Epicure  yet I look upon Cleanliness not to be any extraordinary Luxury  though Mandeville calls it so  when he wants to help out a disingenuous Argument   I have rode several Days through this quondam Kingdom  and was so persuaded  that I strayed into Gulliver s Country of Hounhymns  that I was almost tempted to alight from my Horse  and swear Allegiance to him  for I could not perceive a Grain of Corn  through all the Fields  but Oats  nor any one House that was too good for a Stable  And when at last I chanced to espy a Garden of Wheat  I rejoiced  like the shipwrecked Sailor  who  thinking himself cast away upon a desart Island  when he observed a Circle described on the Sands  cried out    Courage  my Friends  for human Creatures inhabit here     Page  80There is a Saying among Foreigners  who observe the Cleverness of the Generality of the Scotch Gentlemen  who travel abroad  that Scotland keeps all her Fools at home  But I think they are mistaken in this Particular  for  really  those of that Nation  whom I have had any Sort of Commerce with  are  ne Feuls   I shall not press this Remark farther  as I think all national Reflections both unphilosophical and unjust  I shall take Leave of you now  for  as my ingenious Hostess of the Garter often expresses herself  I am tired after my Fatigue   Adieu   my own Fanny   Henry   LETTER CCVIII   Dear FANNY   YOU desired to hear from me on Wednesday  but you may see my Impatience  in writing to you a Post sooner   I had a very direct and obstinate Wind in my Face  all the Day  and very disagreeable Weather of Rain and Hail  however I jogged on hither  to shew that neither Wind or Weather should get the better of me  I suffered greatly from the Cholic  but chewed Page  81 Rheubarb all the Way  Mutton Chops was the Word  and now your Health goes round  which is a just Manner of speaking  as I pledge myself to that Toast  every Glass   I direct this to India  because I know you are to dine there To morrow  and might be from home  before the Post reached your Lodgings  My Love to the Company  and remember that the Council of Six is still complete  as I have left my Deputy with you  So
