 You may make light of my intention  and so will I of the trouble I have been at  if your Lordship make not light of me  But were I  my Lord  in your own palace at Naples  I would tell you  that you seem not to know  in my case  what graciousness is  Yet I ask not for favour from you  but as much for your own sake  as mine   Dear Grandison  said the Bishop—My Lord  to his brother—Did you not promise me—Why did you mention Olivia to the Chevalier   Does that disturb you  Sir  said the General to me  I cannot make light of a man of your consequence  especially with Ladies  Sir—in a scornful manner   The General  you see  my Lord▪ said I  turning to the Bishop  has an insuperable ill will to me  I found  when I attended him at Naples  that he had harboured surmises that were as injurious to his sister  as to me  I was in hopes that I had obviated them  but a rooted malevolence will recur  However  satisfied as I am with my own 〈◊〉  he shall  for many sakes  find it very difficult to provoke me   For my own sake  among the rest  Chevalier  with an air of drollery     300 You are at liberty  returned I  to make your own constructions  Allow me  my Lords  to attend you to Signor Jeronymo   Not till you are cordial friends  said the Bishop—Brother  give me your hand  offering to take it—Chevalier  yours—  Dispose of mine as you please  my Lord  said I  holding it out   He took it and the General s at the same time  and would have joined them   Come  my Lord  said I  to the General  and snatched his reluctant hand  accept of a friendly offer  from a heart as friendly  Let me honour you  from my own knowlege  for those great qualities which the world gives you  I demand your favour from a consciousness that I deserve it  and that I could not  were I to submit to be treated with indignity by any man  I should be sorry to look little in your eyes  but I will not in my own   Who can bear the superiority this man assumes  brother   You oblige me  my Lord  to assert myself   The Chevalier speaks nobly  my Lord  His character is well known  Let me lead you both friends to our Jeronymo  But say  Brother —Say  Chevalier  that you are so   I cannot bear  said the General  that the Chevalier Grandison should imagine himself of so much consequence to my sister  as some of you seem to think him   You know me not  my Lord  I have at present no wish but for the recovery of your sister and Signor Jeronymo  Were I able to be of service to them  that service would be my reward  But  my Lord  if it will make you easy  and induce you to treat me  as my own heart tells me I ought to be treated  I will give you my honour  and let me say  that it never yet was forfeited  that whatever turn your sister s   301 malady may take  I will not accept of the heighest favour that can be done me  but with the joint consent of the three brothers  as well as of your father and mother  Permit me to add  that I will not enter into any family that shall think meanly of me  nor subject the woman I love to the contempt of her own relations   This indeed is nobly said  replied the General  Give me your hand upon it  and I am your friend for ever   Proud man  He could not bear to think  that a sumple English gentleman  as he looks upon me to be  should ally with their family  improbable as it is  in his own opinion  that the unhappy Lady should ever recover her reason  But he greatly loves the Count of Belvedere  and all the family was fond of an alliance with that deserving nobleman   The Bishop rejoiced to find us at last in a better way of understanding each other  than we had hitherto been in  and it was easier for me to allow for this haughty man  as Mrs  Beaumont had let me know what the behaviour was that I had to expect from him  And indeed  his father  mother  and two brothers  were very apprehensive of it  It will therefore be a pleasure to them  that I have so easily overcome his prejudices   They both advised me to suspend my visit to their brother till the afternoon  that they might have the more time to consult with one another  and to prepare and dispose their sister to see me   At taking leave  the General snatched my hand  and  with an air of pleasantry  said  I have a wife  Grandison  I wished him joy  You need not  said he  for I have it  One of the best of women  She
