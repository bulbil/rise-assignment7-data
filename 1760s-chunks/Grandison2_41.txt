opportunity to inform myself  whether that Lady s relations  or herself  live at Canterbury  On Monday  it seems  Sir Charles sets out for that Canterbury   Our noble guests would not stay supper  They had not been gone two hours before I had an humourous letter from Miss Grandison  I inclose it   Sat  night  10 o clock   LORD and Lady L  rejoice me  by telling me  you will accompany them to Colnebrooke on Monday —That s my good girl —I will go with them for the sake of your company  Yet I had half denied them  And why  Because  if you must know—But hush—and catch a mouse—Because a certain Impertinent proposes a visit there  and I had thoughts to take the opportunity of being alone in town to rid my hands for ever  if possible  of another silly fellow  of whom  for one month  a great while ago  I thought tolerably   You and I Harriet  will open to each other all our hearts  There is one chamber that has two beds in it  We will have that  Our dressing room shall be common to both  Lady L  is a morning killer  She always loved her bed  So we shall have charming opportunities for tête à tête conversation   I will drink tea with you to morrow—No  but I won t  You and your cousins shall drink tea with us—Do you hear  I won t be denied  And then we ll settle how it shall be  I ll tell you what  my dear—   102 If  on my brother s return from Canterbury  he comes to us at Colnebrooke  we will call him to account for all his reserves  Here is this affair of Pollexfen s  How might it have ended  I tremble to think of it—You ll stand by me  Won t you  I cannot make Lord and Lady L  of my party  or I would have rebelled before now—But you and I  my dear  I warrant you—Yet you are so grave  Were you always such a grave  such a wise  such a very wise girl  Harriet  Was your grandfather a very sententious man  Was his name Solomon Shirley   I love wisdom as well as any body  But wisdom  out of its place  is a prude  my dear  How I ramble —You ll come to morrow—I designed but two lines  Adieu  Believe me  Ever Yours  C  G   I hope  Lucy  I was not wrong in so readily consenting to go to Colnebrooke  My own inclination  indeed  was in my compliance  and I begin to mistrust myself  where ever that strongly leads  Yet why should I undervalue myself  I know my heart to be good  In that I will not yield to any body  I have no littleness in my mind  Naturally I have not  Guard me  O my friends  by your prayers  that no littleness  that is not natural to my heart  may depreciate it  and make me unworthy of the love you have ever shewn to  Your HARRIET BYRON   LETTER VII  Miss HARRIET BYRON  To Miss LUCY SELBY    Sunday  Mar  5   MY cousins will have it  that I am far gone in a certain passion  They speak quite out   and with a man that has given no encouragement—Encouragement    103 how meanly sounds that word  But I hope they are mistaken  I cannot say  but one may prefer  if one were to have one s choice—one man to another—But that is a different thing from being run away with by so vehement a folly as they are ready to ascribe to me   Well  but  under this notion  they are solicitous that I should not neglect any opportunity  What a poor creature do they think me   of ingratiating myself with the sisters  And therefore I must  by all means  accept of Miss Grandison s invitation to tea   I insisted  however  that they should accompany me  as they likewise were invited  And they obliged me—I may say themselves too  for they admire the brother and sisters as much as I do   We found together Lord and Lady L  Miss Grandison  Miss Jervois  Dr  Bartlett  and Mr  Grandison  Sir Charles was in his drawing room  adjoining to the study  a lady with him  they said  What business had I to wish to know whether it was an elderly or a young lady  But I must tell you all my follies  When we alighted  a very genteel chair made way for our coach   Mr  Grandison made up to me  and  as heretofore  said very silly things  but with an air  as if he were accustomed to say such  and to have them received as gallant things  by those to whom he addressed them  How painful is it to a mind not quite at ease  to be obliged to be civil  when the ear is invaded by contemptible speeches  from a man who must think as highly of himself for uttering them  as meanly of the understanding of the person he is speaking to   Miss
