      Ah  Mr  Meekly   replied the earl  the comfort that you mention   is promised only to the deeply contrite and broken of heart  to   those who duly lament the baseness of their offences against so   great and good a God  Neither do I despair  my friend  but that   I also may finally share some portion of that same comfort   for    as I feelingly acknowledge myself the greatest of all sinners  so   I wish for grace to make me the greatest of penitents      God be praised  cried Meekly  for the grace already given    There was a time  my lord  when  as you told me  you had nothing   of these divine dispositions   when the world  as you said  seemed   to hold out happiness to you on either hand   when fortune  title    precedence  circling honours about you  and within you youth and   health  and a revelling flow of blood and spirits  wholly disguised   and concealed the state of your nature from you   when they hid   from you your own body of frailty  distemper  sin  and death  and   left you no occasion to call out for a Saviour  as you felt nothing   from which you desired to be saved  But God has now been   graciously pleased to send you his monitors  and to call upon you   by affliction  that you  in your turn  may call upon him who alone   can give you consolation      It is not  my lord  to the mourners for sin alone to whom   comfort is promised   the state of suffering and mourning is in   its nature extremely salutary  and of happy tendency to man     and it is  therefore  that the suffering JESUS hath pronounced   it blessed      The God of all love takes no delight in the sufferings of his   poor and pitiable creatures  neither would he have made this   state of our mortality a vale of tears  and a state of misery  had   it not been in order to conduct us through transitory evils to   ever enduring bliss  where  he himself will wipe all tears from   our eyes       When Adam  by his apostasy and falling off from his Maker    had converted all the goods of his temporary state into evil in    citements to lust  covetousness  and sensuality  God determined    by a gracious reverse  to turn all the evils of corrupt and fallen   nature into means of enduring good to his fallen and frail creatures    he therefore appointed pain  affliction  distress  and disease  to be   his ministers  his monitors  and preachers within us  to convince   us of all the evil of our depraved and mortal nature   to wean us   from a world that is full of false promises  but empty of true   enjoyment   to remind us that we are strangers and pilgrims upon   earth  to turn our eye to the star that hath visited us from on         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  337     high   and finally  through our sufferings  to accomplish the great   work of his own salvation in us      Thank you  thank you  Mr  Meekly   these are comforting things   indeed  They pluck comfort from the very depth and abyss of   affliction   I love that my God should be lovely to my heart  You   have now rent the dark veil that long hung before my eyes   and   the Sun of Eighteousness breaks upon me through the clouds of   my mortality  But what of death  Mr  Meekly  what of death     my friend   I am interested in the question   my time is approach    ing  When this body shall fall to dust  and all these organs of   sensation be utterly cut off  what remains what then shall follow     by what means shall my spirit attain the powers of new perception     or am I to lie in the grave  in a state of total insensibility  till   the last trumpet shall sound  My nature shrinks  I confess  from   a total deprivation of the sense of existence      It is no way evident to me  my lord  that body  or at least such   gross bodies as we now have  are necessary to the perceptions and   sensibilities of our spirit  God himself is a Spirit  an all seeing    all hearing  all tasting  all smelling  all feeling  all knowing  and   all governing Spirit   He who made the eye  shall he not see    He who made the ear  shall
