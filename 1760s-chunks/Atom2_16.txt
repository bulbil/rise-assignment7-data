barbers   c  because their salaries were included in the ordinary expence of the crown  I shall only observe  that a certain person who could not read  was appointed librarian to his imperial majesty   These were all the men of superlative genius  that Yak strot could find at this period in the empire of Japan   Whilst this great patriot was thus employed in executing his schemes of oeconomy with more zeal than discretion  and in providing his poor relations with lucrative offices under the government  a negociation for peace was brought upon the carpet by the mediation of certain neutral powers  and Orator Taycho arrogated to himself the province of discussing the several articles of the treaty —Upon this occasion he shewed himself surprizingly   91 remiss and indifferent in whatever related to the interest of Japan  particularly in regulating and fixing the boundaries of the Chinese and Japonese settlements in Fatsisio  the uncertainty of which had given rise to the war  but when the business was to determine the claims and pretensions of his ally Brut an tiffi  on the continent of Tartary  he appeared stiff and immoveable as mount Athos  He actually broke off the negotiation  because the emperor of China would not engage to drive by force of arms the troops of his ally the princess of Ostrog  from a village or two belonging to the Tartarian free booter  who  by the bye  had left them defenceless at the beginning of the war  on purpose that his enemies might  by taking possession of them  quicken the resolutions of the Dairo to send over an army for the protection of Yesso     92 The court of Pekin perceiving that the Japonese were rendered intolerably insolent and overbearing by success  and that an equitable peace could not be obtained while Orator Taycho managed the reins of government at Meaco  and his friend Brut an tiffi found any thing to plunder in Tartary  resolved to fortify themselves with a new alliance  They actually entered into closer connections with the king of Corea  who was nearly related to the Chinese emperor  had some old scores to settle with Japan  and because he desired those disputes might be amicably compromised in the general pacification  had been grossly insulted by Taycho  in the person of his ambassador  He had for some time dreaded the ambition of the Japonese ministry  which seemed to aim at universal empire  and he was  moreover  stimulated by this outrage   93 to conclude a defensive alliance with the emperor of China  a measure which all the caution of the two courts could not wholly conceal from the knowledge of the Japonese politicians   Mean while a dreadful cloud big with ruin and disgrace seemed to gather round the head of Brut an tiffi  The Mantchoux Tartars  sensible of the inconvenience of their distant situation from the scene of action  which rendered it impossible for them to carry on their operations vigorously in conjunction with the Ostrog  resolved to secure winter quarters in some part of the enemy s territories  from whence they should be able to take the field  and act against him early in the spring  With this view they besieged and took a frontier fortress belonging to Brut an tiffi  situated upon a great inland lake which extended as far as the capital of the Mantchoux  who were thus enabled to send thither by   94 water carriage all sorts of provisions and military stores for the use of their army  which took up their winter quarters accordingly in and about this new acquisition  It was now that the ruin of Brut an tiffi seemed inevitable  Orator Taycho saw with horror the precipice to the brink of which his dear ally was driven  Not that his fears were actuated by sympathy or friendship  Such emotions had never possessed the heart of Taycho  No  he trembled because he saw his own popularity connected with the fate of the Tartar  It was the success and petty triumphs of this adventurer which had dazzled the eyes of the blatant beast  so as to disorder its judgment  and prepare it for the illusions of the Orator  but  now that Fortune seemed ready to turn tail to Brut an tiffi  and leave him a prey to his adversaries  Taycho knew the dispositions of the   95 monster so well as to prognosticate that its applause and affection would be immediately turned into grumbling and disgust  and that he himself  who had led it blindfold into this unfortunate connexion  might possibly fall a sacrifice to its resentment  provided he could not immediately project some scheme to divert its attention  and transfer the blame from his own shoulders   For this purpose he employed his invention  and succeeded to his wish  Having called a council of the Twenty eight  at which the Dairo assisted in person  he proposed  and insisted upon it  that a strong squadron of Fune should be immediately ordered to scour the seas  and kidnap all the vessels and ships belonging to the king of Corea  who had acted during the whole war with the most scandalous partiality in favour of the Chinese emperor  and was now so intimately connected   96 with that potentate  by means of a secret alliance  that he ought to be prosecuted with the same hostilities which the other had severely felt  The whole council were confounded at this proposal  the Dairo stood aghast  the Cuboy trembled
