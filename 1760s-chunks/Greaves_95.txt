on a Wednesday  be cast at the Old Bailey on Thursday  and suffer on a Friday  and he strenuously recommended it to him to appear in the cart with a nosegay in one hand  and the Whole Duty of Man in the other   But if in case it should be in the winter   said the squire   when a nosegay can t be had  — Why  then   replied the conjurer   an orange will do as well    These material points being adjusted to the entire satisfaction of Timothy  he declared he would bestow another shilling to know the fortune of an old companion  who truly did not deserve so much at his hands  but he could not help loving him better than e er a friend he had in the world  So saying  he dropped a third offering in the coffin  and desired to know the fate of his horse Gilbert  The astrologer having again consulted his art  pronounced that Gilbert would die of the staggers  and his carcase be given to the hounds  a sentence which made a much deeper impression upon Crabshaw s mind  than did the prediction of his own untimely and disgraceful fate  He shed a plenteous shower of tears  and his grief broke forth in some passionate expressions of tenderness  At length he told the astrologer he would go and send up the captain  who wanted to consult him about Margery Cook  because as how she had informed him that Dr  Grubble had described just such another man as the captain for her true love  and he had no great stomach to the match  if so be as the stars were not bent upon their coming together   Accordingly the squire being dismissed by the conjurer  descended to the parlour with a rueful length of face  which being perceived by the captain  he demanded   What cheer  ho   with some signs of apprehension  Crabshaw making no return to this salute  he asked if the conjurer had taken an observation  and told him anything  Then the other replied  he had told him more than he desired to know   Why  an that be the case   said the seaman   I have no occasion to go aloft this trip  brother    This evasion would not serve his turn  Old Tisiphone was at hand  and led him up growling into the hall of audience  which he did not examine without trepidation  Having been directed to the coffin  where he presented half a crown  in hope of rendering the fates more propitious  the usual ceremony was performed  and the doctor addressed him in these words   Approach  Raven   The captain advancing   You an t much mistaken  brother   said he   heave your eye into the binnacle  and box your compass  you ll find I m a Crowe  not a Raven  thof indeed they be both fowls of a feather  as the saying is  — I know it   cried the conjurer   thou art a northern crow —a sea crow  not a crow of prey  but a crow to be preyed upon —a crow to be plucked —to be flayed —to be basted —to be broiled by Margery upon the gridiron of matrimony   The novice changing colour at this denunciation   I do understand your signals  brother   said he   and if it be set down in the log book of fate that we must grapple  why then  ware timbers  But as I know how the land lies  d ye see  and the current of my inclination sets me off  I shall haul up close to the wind  and mayhap we shall clear Cape Margery  But howsomever  we shall leave that reef in the fore top sail —I was bound upon another voyage  d ye see—to look and to see  and to know if so be as how I could pick up any intelligence along shore concerning my friend Sir Launcelot  who slipped his cable last night  and has lost company  d ye see     What   exclaimed the cunning man   art thou a crow  and canst not smell carrion  If thou wouldst grieve for Greaves  behold his naked carcase lies unburied  to feed the kites  the crows  the gulls  the rooks  and ravens  — What  broach d to    Dead as a boil d lobster  — Odd s heart  friend  these are the heaviest tidings I have heard these seven long years—there must have been deadly odds when he lowered his top sails—smite my eyes  I had rather the Mufti had foundered at sea  with myself and all my generation on board—well fare thy soul  flower of the world  had honest Sam Crowe been within hail—but what signifies palavering   Here the tears of unaffected sorrow flowed plentifully down the furrows of the seaman s cheeks —then his grief giving way to his indignation   Hark ye  brother conjurer   said he   you can spy foul weather before it comes  d—n your eyes  why did not you give us warning of this here squall  B—st my limbs  I ll make you give an account of this here d—ned  horrid  confounded murder  d ye see—mayhap
