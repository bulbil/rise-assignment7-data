the humble born Pamela  than the rags       your good mother raised me from   Your rings  sir  your necklace        and your ear rings  will better befit ladies of degree  than me        and to lose the best jewel  my virtue  would be poorly recompensed       by those you propose to give me   What should I think  when I       looked upon my finger  or saw in the glass those diamonds on my       neck  and in my ears  but that they were the price of my honesty        and that I wore those jewels outwardly  because I had none inwardly        VI  Now  Pamela  will you see by this  what a value I set upon the   free will of a person already in my power  and who  if these proposals   are not accepted  shall find  that I have not taken all these pains  and   risked my reputation  as I have done  without resolving to gratify my   passion for you  at all adventures  and if you refuse  without making   any terms at all           VI   I know  sir  by woful experience  that I am in your power        I know all the resistance I can make will be poor and weak  and        perhaps  stand me in little stead  I dread your will to ruin me       is as great as your power  yet  sir  will I dare to tell you        that I will make no free will offering of my virtue   All that       I can do  poor as it is  I will do  to convince you  that your       offers shall have no part in my choice  and if I cannot escape       the violence of man  I hope  by God s grace  I shall have nothing       to reproach myself  for not doing all in my power to avoid my       disgrace  and then I can safely appeal to the great God  my only       refuge and protector  with this consolation  That my will bore no       part in my violation        VII  You shall be mistress of my person and fortune  as much as if the   foolish ceremony had passed  All my servants shall be yours  and you   shall choose any two persons to attend yourself  either male or female    without any control of mine  and if your conduct be such  that I have   reason to be satisfied with it  I know not  but will not engage for   this  that I may  after a twelvemonth s cohabitation  marry you  for  if   my love increases for you  as it has done for many months past  it will   be impossible for me to deny you any thing        And now  Pamela  consider well  it is in your power to oblige me on   such terms  as will make yourself  and all your friends  happy  but this   will be over this very day  irrevocably over  and you shall find all you   would be thought to fear  without the least benefit arising from it to   yourself        And I beg you ll well weigh the matter  and comply with my proposals    and I will instantly set about securing to you the full effect of them    And let me  if you value yourself  experience a grateful return on this   occasion  and I ll forgive all that s past            VII   I have not once dared to look so high  as to such a       proposal as your seventh article contains   Hence have proceeded       all my little abortive artifices to escape from the confinement       you have put me in  although you promised to be honourable to me        Your honour  well I know  would not let you stoop to so mean and       so unworthy a slave  as the poor Pamela  All I desire is  to be       permitted to return to my native meanness unviolated   What have       I done  sir  to deserve it should be otherwise   For the obtaining       of this  though I would not have married your chaplain  yet would       I have run away
