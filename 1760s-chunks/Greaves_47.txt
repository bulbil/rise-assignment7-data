in fact the occasion of the knight s detention and the squire s disgrace             CHAPTER ELEVEN  DESCRIPTION OF A MODERN MAGISTRATE   Before the knight would take any resolution for extricating himself from his present embarrassment  he desired to be better acquainted with the character and circumstances of the justice by whom he had been confined  and likewise to understand the meaning of his own detention  To be informed in this last particular  he renewed his dialogue with the turnkey  who told him through the grate  that Ferret no sooner perceived him in the jail without his offensive arms  which he had left below  than he desired to be carried before the justice  where he had given information against the knight  as a violator of the public peace  who strolled about the country with unlawful arms  rendering the highways unsafe  encroaching upon the freedom of elections  putting his majesty s liege subjects in fear of their lives  and  in all probability  harbouring more dangerous designs under an affected cloak of lunacy  Ferret  upon this information  had been released  and entertained as an evidence for the King  and Crabshaw was put into the stocks  as an idle stroller   Sir Launcelot  being satisfied in these particulars  addressed himself to his fellow prisoners  and begged they would communicate what they knew respecting the worthy magistrate  who had been so premature in the execution of his office  This request was no sooner signified  than a crew of naked wretches crowded around him  and  like a congregation of rooks  opened their throats all at once  in accusation of Justice Gobble  The knight was moved at this scene  which he could not help comparing  in his own mind  to what would appear upon a much more awful occasion  when the cries of the widow and the orphan  the injured and oppressed  would be uttered at the tribunal of an unerring Judge  against the villanous and insolent authors of their calamity   When he had  with some difficulty  quieted their clamours  and confined his interrogation to one person of a tolerably decent appearance  he learned  that Justice Gobble  whose father was a tailor  had for some time served as a journeyman hosier in London  where he had picked up some law terms  by conversing with hackney writers and attorneys  clerks of the lowest order  that  upon the death of his master  he had insinuated himself into the good graces of the widow  who took him for her husband  so that he became a person of some consideration  and saved money apace  that his pride  increasing with his substance  was reinforced by the vanity of his wife  who persuaded him to retire from business  that they might live genteelly in the country  that his father dying  and leaving a couple of houses in this town  Mr  Gobble had come down with his lady to take possession  and liked the place so well  as to make a more considerable purchase in the neighbourhood  that a certain peer being indebted to him in the large way of his business  and either unable or unwilling to pay the money  had compounded the debt  by inserting his name in the commission  since which period his own insolence  and his wife s ostentation  had exceeded all bounds  that  in the execution of his authority  he had committed a thousand acts of cruelty and injustice against the poorer sort of people  who were unable to call him to a proper account  that his wife domineered with a more ridiculous  though less pernicious usurpation  among the females of the place  that  in a word  she was the subject of continual mirth  and he the object of universal detestation   Our adventurer  though extremely well disposed to believe what was said to the prejudice of Gobble  would not give entire credit to this description  without first inquiring into the particulars of his conduct  He therefore asked the speaker  what was the cause of his particular complaint   For my own part  sir   said he   I lived in repute  and kept a shop in this here town  well furnished with a great variety of articles  All the people in the place were my customers  but what I and many others chiefly depended upon  was the extraordinary sale at two annual customary fairs  to which all the country people in the neighbourhood resorted to lay out their money  I had employed all my stock  and even engaged my credit  to procure a large assortment of goods for the Lammas market  but  having given my vote in the election of a vestry clerk  contrary to the interest of Justice Gobble  he resolved to work my ruin  He suppressed the annual fairs  by which a great many people  especially publicans  earned the best part of their subsistence  The country people resorted to another town  I was overstocked with a load of perishable commodities  and found myself deprived of the best part of my home customers  by the ill nature and revenge of the justice  who employed all his influence among the common people  making use of threats and promises  to make them desert my shop  and give their custom to
