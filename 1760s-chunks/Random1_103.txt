perfectly well acquainted with the soundings of the harbour  who affirmed there was water enough for five eighty gun ships to lye a breast in  almost up at the very walls —The disappointments we suffered  occasioned an universal dejection  which was not at all alleviated by the objects that daily and hourly entertained our eyes  nor by the prospect of what must inevitably happen  if we remained much longer in this place —Such was the oeconomy in some ships  that  rather than be at the trouble of interring the dead  their commanders ordered their men to throw the bodies overboard  many withouteither ballast or winding sheet  so that numbers of human carcasses floated in the harbour  until they were devoured by sharks and carrion crows  which afforded no agreeable spectacle to those who survived —At the same time the wet season began  during which  a deluge of rain falls from the rising to the setting of the sun  without intermission  and that no sooner ceases  than it begins to thunder and lighten with such continual flashing  that one can see to read a very small print by the illumination     297  CHAP  XXXIV   An epidemick fever rages among us—we abandon our conquests—I am seized with the distemper  write a petition to the captain  which is rejected—I am in danger of suffocation through the malice of Crampley  and relieved by a serjeant—my fever increases—the chaplain wants to confess me—I obtain a favourable crisis—Morgan s affection for me proved—the behaviour of Mackshane and Crampley towards me—Captain Oakhum is removed into another ship with his beloved doctor—our new captain described—an adventure of Morgan   THE change of the atmosphere  occasioned by this phoenomenon  conspired with the stench that surrounded us  the heat of the climate  our own constitutions impoverished by bad provision  and our despair  to introduce the bilious fever among us  which raged with such violence that three fourths of those whom it invaded  died in a deplorable manner  the colour of their skin  being by the extreme putrefaction of their juices  changed into that of soot   Our conductors finding things in this situation  perceived it was high time to relinquish our conquests  which we did  after having rendered their   298 artillery useless and blown up their walls with gun powder —Just as we sailed from Bocca Chica on our return to Jamaica  I found myself threatened with the symptoms of this terrible distemper  and knowing very well that I stood no chance for my life  if I should be obliged to lie in the cockpit  which by this time  was grown intolerable even to people in health  by reason of the heat and unwholsome smell of decayed provision  I wrote a petition to the captain representing my case  and humbly imploring his permission to lie among the soldiers in the middle deck  for the benefit of the air  But I might have spared myself the trouble  for this humane commander refused my request  and ordered me to continue in the place allotted for the surgeon s mates  or else be contented to lie in the hospital  which  by the bye  was three degrees more offensive and more suffocating than our own birth below —Another in my condition  perhaps  would have submitted to his fate  and died in a pet  but I could not brook the thought of perishing so pitifully  after I had weathered so many gales of hard fortune  I therefore  without minding Oakhum s injunction  prevailed upon the soldiers  whose good will I had acquired  to admit my hammock among them  and actually congratulated myself upon my comfortable situation  which Crampley no sooner understood  than he signified to the captain  my contempt of his orders  and was invested with power to turn me down again into my proper habitation —This barbarous piece of revenge  incensed me so much against the author  that I vowed  with bitter imprecations  to call him to a severe account  if ever it should be in   299 my power  and the agitation of my spirits increased my fever to a violent degree —While I lay gasping for breath in this infernal abode  I was visited by a serjeant  the bones of whose nose I had reduced and set to rights  after they had been demolished by a splinter during our last engagement  He being informed of my condition  offered me the use of his birth in the middledeck  which was inclosed with canvas and wellaired by a port hole that remained open within it —I embraced this proposal with joy  and was immediately conducted to the place  where I was treated  while my illness lasted  with the utmost tenderness and care by this grateful halberdier  who had no other bed for himself than a hencoop  during the whole passage—Here I lay and enjoyed the breeze  notwithstanding of which  my malady gained ground  and at length my life was despaired of  though I never lost hopes of recovery  even when I had the mortification to see  from my cabbin window  six or seven thrown over board every day  who died of the same distemper  This confidence  I am persuaded  conduced a good deal to the preservation of my life  especially  when joined to another resolution I took at the beginning  namely  to refuse all medicine  which I could not help thinking co operated with
