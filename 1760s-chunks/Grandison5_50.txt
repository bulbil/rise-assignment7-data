to wish her success  for her young man rises every day in his character  My dear creature  you must  you shall  be in our row  and Lady D s last Letter to you is unanswerable  Forgive me for touching upon this subject  But we have no hopes  You have nothing to fear  since you expect what the next mails will bring  And who of us  after all  have our first Love  Aunt Nell would not have descended sola into her greys  nor Cicely Badger neither  if they might have obtained the men of their choice—Poor aunt Nell  she has been telling me  her taken off spectacles in her fingers  of a disappointment of this kind in her youth  with such woeful earnestness  that it made me ready to cry for her  She lays it at the door of her brother  Page  125 my poor father  and now will you wonder  that  to this hour  she cannot speak of him with patience —Poor aunt Nell   Well  but how do you  my Love  For Heaven s sake  be well  Could I make you speak out  could I make you complain  I should have some hope of you  But so sorrowful when alone  as we plainly see  yet aiming to be so chearful in company—O my dear  you must be gluttonous of grief in your solitary hours  But what tho  the man be Sir Charles Grandison  Is not the woman Harriet Byron   Lady L  tells me  that Olivia behaved like a distracted woman  when she took leave of her on her setting out to return to Italy  She sometimes wept  sometimes raved and threatned  Wretched woman  Surely she will not attempt the life of the man she so ungovernably loves  Our case  Harriet  is not so hard as hers  But she will sooner get over her talkative  than you will your silent Love  When a person can rave  the passion is not dangerous  If the head be safe  pride and supposed slight will in time harden the heart of such a one  and her Love will be swallowed up by resentment   You complimented me on my civility to my good man  all the time we were with you  Indeed I was very civil to him  It is now become a habit  and I verily think that it looks well in man and wife to behave prettily to each other before company  I now and then  however  sit down with a full design to make him look about him  but he is so obliging  that I am constrained  against my intention  to let the fit go off  without making him very serious   Am I conceited  Harriet  Which of the two silly folks  do you think  has most  Not wit—Wit is a foolish thing  but  understanding  I think the woman has it  all to nothing —Now don t mortify me  If you pretend to doubt  I will be sure  Upon my word  my dear  I am an excellent creature  so thinking  soPage  126 assured  to behave so obligingly as I do to Lord G  Never  never  unless a woman has as much prudence as your Charlette  let her wed a man who has less understanding than herself  But women marry not so much now a days for Love  or fitness of tempers  as for the liberty of gadding abroad  with less censure  and less controul—And yet  now I think of it  we need only to take a survey of the flocks of single women which croud to Ranelagh and Vaux hall markets  dressed out to be cheapened  not purchased  to be convinced that the maids are as much above either shame or controul  as the wives  But were not fathers desirous to get the drugs off their hands  to express myself in young Danby s saucy stile  these freedoms would not be permitted  As for mothers  many of them are for escorting their daughters to public places  because they themselves like racketing   But how  Charlotte  methinks you ask  do these reflexions on your own Sex square with what you said above of the preference of women to men —How  I ll tell you  The men who frequent those places are still more silly than we  Is it their interest to join in this almost universal dissipation  And would the women croud to market  if there were not men   We are entered into our new house  It is furnished in taste  Lord G  has wanted but very little of my correction  I do assure you  in the disposition of every thing  He begins to want employment  Have you  Harriet  any thing to busy him in —I am not willing to teach him to knot  Poor man  He has already knit one that he cannot unty   God bless the honest Soul  He came to me  just now  so prim  and so pleased—A Parrot and Paroquet—The Parrot is the finest talker  He had great difficulty  he said  in getting them  He had observed  that I was much taken with Lady Finlay s Parrot  Lady Finlay had a Marmouset too  I wonder the poor man did not
