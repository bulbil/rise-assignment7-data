moment s delay may deprive me of that power   Here we must not abide  Let us depart together  and let me share thy  fortune  Some friends I have that shall receive and comfort thee  I  know the way that leads to the coast  and will conduct thee  Thence may  Lord Salisbury soon find the means of returning to his native country   and thither  for thou wilt not leave me to the mercy of our common  unemies  shall D  Aumont attend thee  I heard him with eagerness  and  implicit confidence  Without pause or reflection I submitted to his  guidance  and in that very hour  we both departed from the castle                      SECT  II     THUS had I rashly ventured forth into a wide and unknown scene of  danger  under the direction of a false guide  whose treachery was soon  discovered  It was night  and the moon cast her mild gleam over all the  prospect that lay before us  D Aumont repeated his assurances of  friendship  spoke with chearfulness and confidence  encouraging me to  hope  and to fix my reliance on his services  I expected every instant  to be conducted to some place of retirement and friendly recepiton   Sometimes I expressed my uneasiness  but ever and anon my guide  practised his arts of soothing persuasion  and flattering professions   to allay my fears  thus we proceeded for some hours  at length  in our  tedious progress  we passed by the skirts of a thick forest  from whence  our ears were first pierced with shrill  and lamentable shrieks as if from a female voice  and instantly  afterwards  there issued out a small number of armed men  who surrounded  us  and demanded our names and quality  My companion  nothing alarmed at  this appearance  made the like enquiries on his part  and learned that  they were the soldiers of Chauvigny Lord of Poictiers  I seek that Lord    the  charitable cares of assisting  and supporting the wounded youth  who by  this time revived from his trance  and cast a languid look of love and  tenderness upon his kind companion   O Jacqueline  said he  are we then  prevented  But thou hast escaped the present danger  Nor shall force  tear me from thee  or time efface thy remembrance   This was answered  with deep sighs and tender looks  which spoke an affection ardent and  powerful  tho  controuled by the presence of strangers  Every word and  every action increased my surprize  Utterly unable to conceive how any  part of the distress I now beheld could be imputed to me  I attempted  with all courtesy to accost the page  who  on the other hand  had no  eyes  no ear  no voice for me  But how was my astonished soul afflicted  and confounded  when one of the soldiers casually discovered  that this  page was no other than a young maiden  and daughter to Les Roches   Whilst she was busily employed about the wounded youth  and with the  assistance of some soldiers raising him from the ground  I turned to  D Aumont with looks of rage and anguish  Wretch  said I  explain this  wonder  Is this the work of thy cursed treachery  No  proud Lord   replied the false Frenchman  This youth is son to Count Chauvigny  whose  prisoner I have made thee  but were he mine enemy  I am no murderer   Witness for me  that if my nature had been cruel  I might have plunged  the dagger into thine own heart  What though I promised Mal leon to use  all my art to separate thee from thy protector  and to betray thee into  the power of the Lord of Poictiers  yet I scorn the base work of blood   I have used my art  and with success  I have served my country and my  Chief  to whose hand the laws of war  and thy fate consign thee  and to  whom thou shalt be soon restored by his friend Chauvigny     I prepared to retort this insolence  when the soldiers interrupted  and  commanded me to attend them to Poictiers  whither we now bent our  course  the wounded  youth being supported by the soldiers  and followed by the sorrowful  Jacqueline  But scarcely had we proceeded a few paces  when another and  a larger body of armed men was discovered  rushing precipitately across  the plain  My guards nothing doubting but that these were friends  took  no pains to avoid their approach  As they poured down upon us  their  leader cast his eyes on me  and with plain marks of surprize pronounced  my name  when instantly the whole party fell with the utmost fury upon  my guards  They in vain endeavoured to support an unequal contest   encouraged by the voice and actions of D Aumont  who fought with  desperate rage  Impatient to take a share in this encounter  I suddenly  snatched my
