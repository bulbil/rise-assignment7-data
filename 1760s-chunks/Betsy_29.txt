advances you made him  and took   all opportunities to shew how much his heart and judgment gave the   preferences to me   These words so piqued the vanity of Miss Betsy    that  not able to bear she should continue in the imagination of being   better liked than herself  though even by the man she hated  told her   the solicitations he had made to her  the letter she had received from   him  and the rebuff she had given him upon it   So that   pursued she     it was not till after he found there was no hope of gaining me  that he   carried his devoirs to you        Miss Flora was more nettled at this eclaircissement than she was at the   discovery she now perceived the other had made of her intrigue  she   pretended  however  not to believe a word of what she had said  but   willing to evade all farther discourse on that head  returned to the   adventure they had just gone through with the Oxonians   Never expect     said she   to pass it upon any one of common sense  that if you had not   a mind to have been alone with that terrible man  as you now describe   him  you would have staid in the room after I was gone  and called to   you to follow        It was in vain that Miss Betsy denied she either heard her speak  or   knew any thing of her departure  till some time after she was gone  and   the gentleman commoner began to use her with such familiarities as   convinced her he was sensible no witnesses were present  This  though no   more than truth  was of no consequence to her justification  to one   determined to believe the worst  or at least seem to do so  Miss Flora   treated with contempt all she said on this score  derided her   imprecations  and  to mortify her the more  said to her  in a taunting   manner   Come  come  Miss Betsy  it is a folly to think to impose upon   the world by such shallow artifices  What your inclinations are  is   evident enough  any one may see  that if it had not been for your   brother s unseasonable interruption  nobody would ever have heard a   word of these insults you so heavily complain of        Poor Miss Betsy could not refrain letting fall some tears at so unjust   and cruel an inuendo  but the greatness of her spirit enabled her in a   few moments to overcome the shock it had given her  she returned   reproaches with reproaches  and  as she had infinitely more of truth and   reason on her side  had also much the better in this combat of tongues    nevertheless the other would not give out  she upbraided and exaggerated   with the most malicious comments on it every little indiscretion Miss   Betsy had been guilty of  repeating every censure which she had heard   the ill natured part of the world pass on her conduct  and added many   more  the invention of her own fertile brain       Some ladies they had made acquaintance with in town coming to visit   them  put an end to the debate  but neither being able presently to   forget the bitter reflections cast on her by the other  both remained   extremely sullen the whole night  and their mutual ill humour might   possibly have lasted much longer  but for an accident more material    which took off their attention  as it might have produced much worse   consequences than any quarrel between themselves could be attended with    It happened in this manner       The brother of Miss Betsy was of a fiery disposition  and though those   who were entrusted with the care of his education were not wanting in   their pains to correct this propensity  which they thought would be the   more unbecoming in him  as he was intended for the pulpit  yet did not   their endeavours for that purpose meet with all the success they wished    Nature may be moderated  but never can be wholly changed  the seeds of   wrath still remained in his soul  nor could the rudiments that had been   given him be sufficient to hinder them from springing into action  when   urged by any provocation  The treatment his sister had received from the   gentleman commoner  seemed to him so justifiable a one  that he thought   he ought not  without great submissions on the part of the transgresser    to be prevailed upon to put up with it       The first step he took was to sound the young student  as to what he   knew relating to the affair  who freely told him  as Miss Betsy had   done  where
