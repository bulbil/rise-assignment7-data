by her harpsichord only  What a whimsical thing is Charlotte Grandison  But still she keeps Lord G  at distance  I told her an hour ago  that she knows not how to condescend to him with that grace which is so natural to her in her whole behaviour to every body else     97 I have been talking to Dr  Bartlett  about Sir Charles s journey to Italy  Nobody knows  he says  what a bleeding heart is cover d by a countenance so benign  and chearful  Sir Charles Grandison  said he  has a prudence beyond that of most young men  but he has great sensiblities   I take it for granted  Sir  that he will for the future be more an Italian than Englishman   Impossible  madam  A prudent youth  by travelling  reaps this advantage—From what he sees of other countries  he learns to prefer his own  An imprudent one the contrary  Sir Charles s country is endeared to him by his long absence from it  Italy in particular is called  The Garden of Europe  but it is rather to be valued for what it was  and might he  than what it is  I need not tell a Lady who has read and conversed as you have done  to what that incomparable difference is owing  Sir Charles Grandison is greatly sensible of it  He loves his country  with the judgment of a wise man  and wants not the partiality of a patriot   But  doctor  he has offered  you know  to reside—There I stopt   True  madam—And he will not recede from his offers  if they are claimed  But this uncertainty it is that disturbs him   I pity my patron  I have often told you he is not happy  What has indiscretion to expect  when discretion has so much to suffer  His only consolation is  that he has nothing to reproach himself with  Inevitable evils he bears as a man should  He makes no ostentation of his piety  But  madam  Sir Charles Grandison is a CHRISTIAN   You need not  Sir  say more to me to exalt him  And  let me add  that I have no small pleasure in knowing that Clementina is a Lady of strict piety  tho  a Roman Catholic   And let me assure you  madam  that Sir Charles s   98 regard for Miss Byron  his more than regard for her  why should I not say  since every body sees it  is founded upon her piety  and upon the amiable qualities of her mind  Beauty  madam  is an accidental and transient good  No man better knows how to distinguish between admiration and love  than my patron  His virtue is virtue upon full proof  and against sensibilities  that it is heroic to overcome  Lady Olivia knows this  And here I must acknowledge myself a debtor to you for three articles out of your ten  I hope soon to discharge the obligation   Your own time  doctor  But I must say  that whenever you give me Lady Olivia s story  I shall be pained  if I find  that a Clementina is considered by a beauty of an unhappier turn  as her rival in the love of Sir Charles Grandison   Lady Olivia  madam  admires him for his virtue  but she cannot  as he has made it his study to do  divide admiration from love  What offers has she not refused —But she declares  that she had rather be the friend of Sir Charles Grandison  than the wife of the greatest prince on earth   This struck me  Have not I said something like it  But surely with innocence of heart  But here the doctor suggests  that Olivia has put his virtue to the proof  Yet I hope not   The FRIEND  Dr  Bartlett —I hope that no woman who is not quite given up to dishonour  will pollute the sacred word  by affixing ideas to it  that cannot be connected with it  A Friend is one of the highest characters that one human creature can shine in to another  There may be Love  that tho  it has no view but to honour  yet even in wedlock  ripens not into friendship  How poor are all such attachments  How much beneath the exalted notion I have of that noblest  that most delicate union of souls  You wonder at me  Dr  Bartlett  Let me repeat to you  Sir  I have it by heart  Sir Charles Grandisons s   99 tender of friendship to the poor Harriet Byron  which has given me such exalted ideas of this disinterested passion  but you must not take notice that I have  I repeated those words  beginning     My heart demands alliance with hers   —and ending with these—  So long as it shall be consistent with her other attachments  a       The doctor was silent for a few moments  At last  What a delicacy is there in the mind of this excellent man  Yet how consistent with the exactest truth  The friendship he offers you  madam  is indeed friendship  What you have repeated can want no explanation  Yet it is expressive
