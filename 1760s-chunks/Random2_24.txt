ashamed at the pitiful figure of my antagonist  who was a poor  little  shivering creature decrepid with   64 age  and blind of one eye —But I soon found the folly of judging from appearances  being at the second pass wounded in the sword hand  and immediately disarmed with such a jerk  that I thought the joint was dislocated —I was no less confounded than enraged at this event  especially as my adversary did not bear his success with all the moderation that might have been expected  for he insisted upon my asking pardon for my presumption in affronting his king and him —This I would by no means comply with  but told him  it was a mean condescension  which no gentleman in his circumstances ought to propose  nor none in my situation perform —and that if he persisted in his ungenerous demand  I would in my turn claim satisfaction with my musket  at which weapon we should be more upon a par  than with the sword  of which he seemed so much master     65  CHAP  XLIV    The gascon does not use his victory with all the moderation that might have been expected—In order to be revenged I learn the science of defence —we join Marechal Duc de Noailles—are engaged with the allies at Dettingen  and put to flight—the behaviour of the French soldiers on that occasion—I industriously seek another combat with the old gascon  and vanquish him in my turn—our regiment is put into winter quarters at Rheims  where I find my friend Strap—our recognition—he supplies me with money  and procures my discharge—we take a trip to Paris  from whence we set out for London by the way of Flanders  where we safely arrive   HE was disconcerted at this declaration  to which he made no reply  but repaired to the dancers  among whom he recounted his victory with many exaggerations and gasconades  while I  taking up my sword  went to my quarters and examined my wound  which I sound was of no consequence —The same day  an Irish drummer  having heard my misfortune  visited me  and after having condoled me on the chance of war  gave me to understand  that he was   66 master of his sword  and would in a very short time instruct me so thoroughly in that noble science  that I should be able to chastise the old gascon for his insolent boasting at my expence —This friendly office he proffered on pretence of the regard he had for his countrymen  but I afterwards learned the true motive was no other than a jealousy be entertained of a correspondence between the Frenchman and his wife  which he did not think proper to resent in person —Be this as it will  I accepted his offer  and practised his lessons with such application  that I soon believed myself a match for my conqueror —In the mean time we continued our march  and arrived at the camp of Mareschal Noailles  the night before the battle of Dettingen  Notwithstanding the fatigue we had undergone  our regiment was one of those that were ordered next day to cross the river  under the command of the Duc de Gramont  to take possession of a narrow defile  through which the allies must of necessity have passed at a great disadvantage  or remain where they were  and perish for want of provision  if they would not condescend to surrender at discretion —How they suffered themselves to be pent up in this manner  it is not my province to relate  I shall only observe  that when we had taken possession of our ground  I heard an old officer in conversation with another  prosess a surprise at the conduct of Lord Stair  who had the reputation of a good general —But it seems  at this time  that nobleman was over ruled  and only acted in an inferior character  so that no part of the blame could be imputed to him  who declared his disapprobation of the step  in consequence of which the whole army was in the utmost danger    67 but providence or destiny acted miracles in their behalf  by disposing the Duc de Gramont to quit his advantageous post  pass the defile  and attack the English  who were drawn up in order of battle on the plain  and who handled us so roughly  that after having lost a great number of men  we turned our backs without ceremony  and fled with such precipitation  that many hundreds perished in the river  through pure fear and confusion  for the enemy was so generous  that they did not pursue us one inch of ground  and if our consternation would have permitted  we might have retreated with great order and deliberation —But not withstanding the royal clemency of the king of Great Britain  who headed the allies in person  and no doubt  put a stop to the carnage  our loss amounted to 5000 men  among whom were many officers of distinction —Our miscarriage opened a passage for the foe to Hanau  whither they immediately marched  leaving their sick and wounded to the care of the French  who next day took possession of the field of battle  buried the dead  and treated the living with humanity —This was a great consolation to us  who thence took occasion to claim the victory  and the genius of the French nation never appeared more conspicuous than now  in
