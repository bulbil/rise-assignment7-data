said  he was of opinion it might be saved  without endangering the lady’s life  The other  with a contemptuous smile  told him  he was sorry he thought him so ignorant of his profession  and without much ceremony  putting him aside  was about to proceed to the operation  when Mr Main laying hold of him  said  that he should never do it in his presence  adding  with some warmth  that he would engage to make a perfect cure of it in a month  without the pain or hazard of amputation   The young lady  who had been an eye witness of what passed  for she would not suffer her face to be covered  now thought it proper to interpose  She told the unfeeling operator  the he might be very sure she would embrace any distant hope of saving herself from the pain  the danger  and the loss she must sustain  if he pursued the method he intended  She was not  however  so irresolute  she said  as to desire either to avoid or postpone the operation  if it should be found necessary  but as there was hope given her of a cure without it  she thought it but reasonable to make the experiment  and should therefore refer the decision of her case to a third person of skill in the profession  by whose opinion she would be determined   The two women servants  who are always professed enemies to chirurgical operations  readily joined in her sentiments  and saying it was a mortal sin to cut and hack any christian  they made haste to cover up their young lady again     The disappointed surgeon hardly forbore rude language to the women  and telling Mr Main he would make him know what it was to traduce the skill of a practitioner of his standing  marched off in a violent passion  saying to his patient  if she had a mind to kill herself  it was nothing to him   The modest young man  delighted to find the case of his beloved not so desperate as he had supposed it to be  begged she would permit him to apply some proper dressings to the afflicted part  and conjuring her to call in the aid of the ablest surgeon that could be procured  took his leave   The brother of the lady being apprized of what had passed  lost no time in sending an express to Bath  and by a very handsome gratuity  induced a surgeon of great eminence to set out immediately for his house  who arrived early the next morning  But in the mean time poor Main had like to have paid dear for his superior skill in his profession  The other surgeon had no sooner got home  than he sent him a challenge  to meet him that evening  in a field at some distance from the town  They met  Main had the good fortune  after wounding  to disarm his antagonist  but first received himself a dangerous wound   This accident was kept from the knowledge of his mistress  but on the arrival of the surgeon from Bath  as he would not take off the dressings  but in the presence of the person who put them on  it was thought proper that both Mr Main and the other man should be sent for  The latter was not by any means in a condition to attend  but the former  though very ill and feverish  desired that he might be carried to the house  The Bath surgeon having  in his and the brother’s presence  examined the case  declared it as his opinion  that the complaint might be removed without amputation  adding  that it was owing to wrong management that the grievance had gone so far  He consulted with Main  in the presence of the family  as to his intended method of treating it for the future  he agreed with him intirely  with regard to the propriety of it  and having assured the friends of the girl  that he thought him a skilful and ingenious young man  took his leave  being obliged to return directly home   The testimony of this gentleman  whose skill was undoubted  and whose impartiality must be so too  having never seen any of the parties concerned in his life before  wrought so much upon the brother  that he did not hesitate to put his sister under the care of her lover     Poor Main  though scarce able to leave his bed for some time  was nevertheless carried to his patient every day  at the hazard of his life  His skill  his tenderness  and his assiduity  were all exerted in a particular manner on the present occasion  and in less than five weeks he had the pleasure to see his mistress restored to perfect health   The consequence of this incident was very happy for them both  the brother  exceedingly pleased at his whole behaviour  told him  he was an honest generous fellow  and since he was convinced it was his sister’s person  and not her fortune he was attached to  he would  with all his heart  bestow both on him  and accordingly Mr Arnold and I had this day the satisfaction of seeing this worthy young pair united in marriage   Patty is not a little delighted at her brother’s good
