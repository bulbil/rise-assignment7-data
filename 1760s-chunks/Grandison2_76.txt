Grandison coloured  and bit her lip  Why did she colour   At last Sir Thomas took a resolution to look into and regulate his affairs  preparative to the leave he intended to give to his beloved son to come over  From his duty  discretion  and good management  he was sure  he said  he should be the happiest of men  But he was at a loss what to do with Mrs  Oldham and her two children  He doubted not  but his son had heard of his guilty commerce with her  Yet he cared not  that the young gentleman should find her living in a kind of wife like state in one of the familyseats  And yet she had made too great a sacrifice to him  to be unhandsomely used  and he thought he ought to provide for his children by her   While he was meditating this change of measures  that he might stand well with a son  whose character for virtue and prudence made his father half afraid of him  a proposal of marriage was made to him for his son by one of the first men in the kingdom  whose daughter  accompanying her brother and his wife  in a tour to France and Italy  saw and fell in Love with the young Gentleman at Florence  And her brother gave way to his sister s regard for him  for the sake of the character he bore among the people of prime consideration in Italy   Sir Thomas had several meetings on this subject  both with the brother  and the Earl his father  and was so fond of bringing it to bear  that he had thoughts of reserving to himself an annuity  and   189 making over the whole of his estate to his son  in favour of this match  And once he said  He should by this means do as Victor Amadeus of Savoy did  rid himself of many incumbrances  and being not a king  was sure of his son s duty to him   The Ladies found a Letter of their brother s among Sir Thomas s loose papers  which shewed that this offer had been actually made him  This is a copy of it   Dear and ever honoured Sir   I AM astonished at the contents of your last favour  If the proposal made in it  arose from the natural greatness of your mind  and an indulgence which I have so often experienced  what shall I say to it  I cannot bear it  If it proceed from proposals made to you  God forbid that I should give your name to a woman  how illustrious soever in her descent  and how high soever the circumstances of her family  whose friends could propose such conditions to my father   I receive with inexpressible joy so near an hope of the long wished for leave to throw myself at your feet in my native country  When I have this happiness granted me  I will unbosom my whole heart to my father  The credit of your name  and the knowledge every one has of your goodness to me  will be my recommendation whenever you shall wish me to enlarge the family connexions   Till I have this honour  I beseech you  Sir  to discontinue the treaty already begun   You are pleased to ask my opinion of the Lady  and whether I have any objection to her person  I remember  I thought her a very agreeable woman   You mention  Sir  the high sense the Lady  as well as Lord and Lady N  have of the civilities they received from me  My long residence abroad gave me the power of doing little offices for those of my country  who visited France and Italy  Those services   190 are too gratefully remember d by my Lord and the Ladies   I am extremely concern d that you have reason to be displeased with any part of the conduct of my sisters  Can the daughters of such a mother as you had the happiness to give them  forget themselves  Their want of consideration shall receive no countenance from me  I shall let them know  that my Love  my esteem  if it be of consequence with them  is not founded on relation  but merit  And that  where duty to a parent is wanting  all other good qualities are to be suspected   You ask my opinion of my Lord L  and whether he has sought to engage me to favour his address to your Caroline  He wrote to me on that subject  I inclose his Letter  and a copy of my answer  As to my opinion of him  I must say  that I have not met with any British man abroad  of whose discretion  sobriety  and good nature  I think more highly than I do of Lord L  s  Justice requires of me this testimony  But as to the affair between him and my sister  I shall be extremely sorry  if Lord L  s first impropriety of behaviour were to you  and if my sister has suffer d her heart to be engaged against her duty   You have the goodness to say  that my return will be a strengthening of your hands  May my own be weaken d  May I ever want the power to do good to myself
