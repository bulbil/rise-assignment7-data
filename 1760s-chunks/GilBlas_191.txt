it were best suited to our purpose  and led us on by winding paths to a spot where a rivulet of transparent water was meandering in its slow and silent course  to incorporate with the waters of Guadalaviar  The refreshing shade afforded by the foliage  and the rich pasturage in which our toil won beasts so much delighted  would have fixed this for the place of our halting  if our resolution had not been previously taken to that effect   We therefore alighted  and were preparing to pass the day very pleasantly  but a good breakfast was amongst the foremost of our intended pleasures  and we found that there was very little ammunition left  Bread was beginning to be a nonentity  and our bottle was becoming an evidence of the material system  mere carnal leather without a vivifying soul  Gentlemen  said Ambrose  scenery and the picturesque have but hungry charms for me  unless Bacchus and Ceres preside over the landscape  Our provisions must be lengthened out  For this purpose  away post I to Xelva  It is a very pretty town  not more than two leagues off  I shall soon make this little excursion  Speaking after this manner  he slung the bottle and the wallet over a horse s back  leaped merrily into his seat  and shot out of the wood with a rapidity which seemed to bid fair for a speedy return   He did not  however  come back quite so soon as he had given us reason to expect  More than half the day had elapsed  nay  night herself was already pranking up her dun and gloomy wings  to overshadow the thicket with a denser horror  when we saw our purveyor once again  whose long stay was beginning to give us some uneasiness  Our extreme wishes were lame and impotent  compared with the abundance of his stores  He not only produced the bottle filled with some excellent wine  and the wallet stuffed with game and poultry ready dressed  to say nothing of bread  the horse was laden besides with a large bundle of stuffs  of which we could make neither head nor tail  He took notice of our wonder  and said with a smile  I will lay a wager  neither Don Raphael nor all the colleges of soothsayers upon earth can guess why I have bought these articles  With this fling at our dulness  we untied the bundle  and lectured on the intrinsic value of what we had been considering only as an empty pageant  In the inventory was a cloak and a black gown of trailing dimensions  doublets  breeches  and hose to correspond  an inkstand and writing paper  such as a secretary of state need not be ashamed of  a key  such as a treasurer might carry  a great seal and green wax  such as a chancellor might affix to his decrees  When he had at length exhausted the display of his bargains  Don Raphael observed in a bantering tone    Faith and troth  Master Ambrose  it must be confessed that you have made a good sensible speculation  But pray  how do you mean to turn the penny on your purchase  Let me alone for that  answered Lamela  All these things cost me only ten pistoles  and it shall go hard but they bring us in above five hundred  The tens in five hundred are fifty  a good improvement of money  my masters  I am not a man to burden myself with a trumpery pedlar s pack  and to prove to you that I have not been making ducks and drakes of our joint stock  I will let you into the secret of a plan which has just taken birth in my pericranium   After having laid in my stock of bread  I went into a cook s shop  where I ordered a range of partridges  chickens  and young rabbits  half a dozen of each  to be put instantly on the spit  While these relishing little articles were roasting  in came a man in a violent passion  open mouthed against the coarse conduct of a tradesman to his consequential self  This faggot of fury observed to the lord paramount of the dripping pan  By St James  Samuel Simon is the most wrong headed retail dealer in the town of Xelva  He has just insulted me in his own shop before his customers  The skinflint would not trust me for six ells of cloth  though he knows very well that my credit is as good as the bank  and that no one could say he ever lost anything by me  Are not you delighted with the outlandish monster  He has no objection to getting people of fashion on his books  He had rather toss up heads or tails with them  than oblige a plain citizen in an honest way  and be paid in full at the time appointed  What a strange whim  But he is an infernal Jew  He will be taken in some day or other  All the merchants on the Exchange are lying in wait to catch him upon the hip  and his disgrace or ruin will be nuts to me   While this reptile of the warehouse was thus spitting his spite and blurting out many other ill natured innuendoes  there came over me a sort of astrological anticipation that I should be lord of the ascendant over this
