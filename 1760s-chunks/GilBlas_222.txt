one another  and put a good face upon it into the bargain       CH  VIII     The reception of Gil Blas among the players at Grenada  and another old acquaintance picked up in the green  room   JUST as Laura was finishing her story  there came in an old actress who lived in her neighbourhood  and was come to take her to the theatre as she passed by  This venerable tutelary of the stage was admirably fitted to play some superannuated strumpet among the heathen goddesses in a pantomime  My sister was not remiss in introducing her brother to that stale old harridan  whereupon a profusion of compliments were bandied about on both sides   I left them together  telling the steward s relict that I would join her again at the playhouse  as soon as I had sent my baggage to the Marquis de Marialva s  to whose residence she directed me  First I went to the room I had hired  whence  after having settled with my landlady  I repaired with a porter who carried my luggage to a large ready furnished house  where my new master was quartered  At the door I met his steward  who asked me if I was not the lady Estella s brother  I answered in the affirmative  Then you are welcome  Signor cavalier  replied he  The Marquis de Marialva  whose steward I have the honour to be  has commissioned me to receive you properly  There is a room got ready for you  I will shew you the way to it  if you please  that you may be quite at home  He took me up to the top of the house  and thrust me into so small a room  that a very narrow bed  a chest of drawers  and two chairs completely filled it  This was my apartment  You will not have much spare room  said my conductor  but as a set  off  I promise you that you shall be superbly lodged at Lisbon  I locked up my portmanteau in the wardrobe and put the key in my pocket  asking at the same time what was the hour of supper  The answer was  that his lordship seldom supped at home  but allowed each servant a monthly sum for board wages  I put several other questions  and learnt that the Marquis s people were a happy set of idle fellows  After a conversation short and sweet  I left the steward to go and look for Laura  reflecting much to my own satisfaction on the happy omens I drew from the opening of my new situation   As soon as I got to the playhouse door  and mentioned my name as Estella s brother  there was free admission at once  You might have observed the forwardness of the guards to make way for me  just as if I had been one of the most considerable noblemen in Grenada  All the supernumeraries  door keepers  and receivers of checks whom I encountered in my progress  made me their very best bows  But what I should like best to give the reader an idea of  is the serious reception which the merry vagrants gave me in the green room  where I found the whole dramatis persona ready dressed  and on the point of drawing up the curtain  The actors and actresses  to whom Laura introduced me  fell upon me without mercy  The men were quite troublesome with their greetings  and the women  not to be outdone  laid their plastered faces alongside of mine  till they covered it with a villanous compound of red and white  No one choosing to be the last in making me welcome  they all paid their compliments in a breath  AEolus himself  answering from all the points of the compass at once  would not have been a match for them  but my sister was  for the loan of her tongue was always at the service of a friend  and she brought me completely out of debt   But I did not get clear off with the squeezes of the principal performers  The civilities of the scene painters  the band  the prompter  the candle snuffer  and the call boy were to be endured with patience  all the understrappers in the theatre came to see me run the gauntlet  One would have supposed one s self in a foundling hospital  and that they had none of them ever known what sort of animals brothers and sisters were   In the mean time the play began  Some gentlemen who were behind the scenes  then ran to get seats in the front of the house  for my part  feeling myself quite at home  I continued in conversation with those of the actors who were waiting to go on  Among the number there was one whom they called Melchior  The name struck me  I looked hard at the person who answered to it  and thought I had seen him somewhere  At last I recollected that it was Melchior Zapata  a poor strolling player  who has been described in the first volume of this true history  as soaking his crusts in the pure element   I immediately took him aside  and said  I am much mistaken if you are not that Signor Melchior with whom I had the honour of breakfasting one day by the
