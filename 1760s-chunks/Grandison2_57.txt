   141 A deep melancholy having seized the young gentleman on a loss so irreparable  his father  who himself was greatly grieved  and the more  as he could not but reproach himself as having at least hasten d that loss  was alarmed for his son  and yielded to the entreaties of General W  brother of Lord W  to permit him to travel  The General recommended for a governor to the young gentleman  an officer under him  who had been wounded  and obliged to quit the military service  Sir Thomas allowed his son 800 l  a year  from the day of his setting out on his travels  which he augmented afterwards to 1 000 l  Sir Charles was about seventeen when his mother died   The two daughters were taken by Lady W  But she dying in about twelve months after Lady Grandison  they returned to their father  who  by that time  had pretty well got over his grief for the loss of his Lady  and was quite recovered of the wounds which he received in the duel that cost her her life   He plac d over his daughters  as governess  though they both took exceptions at that title  supposing themselves of age to manage for themselves  the widow of one of his gay friends  Oldham by name  whose fortune had not held out as Sir Thomas s had done  Men of strong health  I have heard my grandfather say  and of a riotous turn  should not  in mere compassion  keep company with men of feebler constitutions  and make them the companions of their riots  So may one say  I believe  that extravagant men  of great and small fortunes  are equally ill suited  since the expences which will but shake the one  will quite demolish the other   Mrs  Oldham had fine qualities  and was an oeconomist  She deserved a better husband  than had fallen to her lot  and the young Ladies having had a foundation laid by a still more excellent manager  received no small advantage from her skill in family affairs  But it was related to me with reluctance  and   142 as what I must know on a further acquaintance with their family  if they did not tell it to me  that Sir Thomas was grateful to this Lady in a way that cost her her reputation  She was obliged  in short  in little more than a twelvemonth  to quit the country  and to come up to town  She had an indisposition  which kept her from going abroad for a month or two   Lady L  being then about nineteen  and Miss Grandison about sixteen  they had spirit enough to oppose the return of this Lady to her charge  They undertook themselves to manage every thing at the capital seat in Hampshire   Sir Thomas had another seat in Essey  Thither  on the reluctance of the young Ladies to receive again Mrs  Oldham  he carried her  and they  as well as every body else  for some time  apprehended they were actually married  She was handsome  well descended  and tho  she became so unhappily sensible of the favours and presents by which Sir Thomas made way to her heart  she had an untainted character when he took her as a governess to the young Ladies   Was not Sir Thomas very  very faulty  with regard to this poor woman —She had already suffered enough from a bad husband  to whom she remarkably well perform d her duty —Poor woman —The example to his own daughters was an abominable one  She was the relict of his friend  She was under his protection  Thrown into it by her unhappy circumstances —Were not these great aggravations to his crime  Happy for those parents who live not to see such catastrophes as attended this child  This darling  it seems  Not undeservedly so  and whom they thought they had not unhappily married to Mr  Oldham—And he  poor man  thought himself not unhappy in Sir Thomas Grandison s acquaintance  tho  it ended in his emulating him in his expences  with a   143 much less estate  in the ruin of his fortune  which indeed was his own fault  and in the ruin of his wife s virtue  which was more Sir Thomas s than hers —May I say so —If I may not  since women  whose glory is their chastity  must not yield to temptation  had not the husband  however  something to answer for  who  with his eyes open  lived at such a rate  against his wife s dutiful remonstrances  and better example  as reduced her  after his death  to the necessity of dependence on another s favour  and such another   Sir Thomas was greatly displeased with his daughters  for resisting him in the return of their governess  He had thought the reason of her withdrawing a secret  because he wish d it to be one  And yet her disgrace was  at the time  every where talked of  but in his presence   This woman is still living  She has two children by Sir Thomas  who are also living  and one by Mr  Oldham  I shall be told more of her history  when the Ladies come to give
