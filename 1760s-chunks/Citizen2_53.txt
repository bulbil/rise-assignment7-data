 the monody or apotheosis  The nobility need be under no apprehensions  but die as fast as they think proper  the poet and undertaker are ready to supply them  these can find metaphorical tears and family escutcheons at half an hour s warning  and when the one has soberly laid the body in the grave  the other is ready to fix it figuratively among the stars     163There are several ways of being poetically sorrowful on such occasions  The bard is now some pensive youth of science  who sits deploring among the tombs  again he is Thyrsis  complaining in a circle of harmless sheep  Now Britannia sits upon her own shore  and gives a loose to maternal tenderness  at another time  Parnassus  even the mountain Parnassus  gives way to sorrow  and is bathed in tears of distress   But the most usual manner is this  Damon meets Menalcas  who has got a most gloomy countenance  The shepherd asks his friend  whence that look of distress  to which the other replies  that Pollio is no more  If that be the case then  cries Damon  let us retire to yonder bower at some distance off  where the cypress and the jessamine add fragrance to the breeze  and let us weep alternately for Pollio  the friend of shepherds  and the patron of every muse  Ah  returns his fellow shepherd  what think you rather of that grotto by the fountain side  the murmuring stream will help to assist our complaints  and a nightingale on a neighbouring tree will join her voice to the concert  When the place is thus settled  they begin  the brook stands still to hear their lamentations  the cows forget to graze  and the very tygers start from the forest with sympathetic concern  By the tombs of our ancestors  my dear Fum  I am quite unaffected in all this distress  the whole is liquid laudanum to my spirits  and a tyger of common sensibility has twenty times more tenderness than I   But though I could never weep with the complaining shepherd  yet I am sometimes induced to   164 pity the poet  whose trade is thus to make Demigods and Heroes for a dinner  There is not in nature a more dismal figure than a man who sits down to premeditated flattery  every stanza he writes tacitly reproaches the meanness of his occupation  till at last his stupidity becomes more stupid  and his dullness more diminutive   I am amazed therefore that none have yet found out the secret of flattering the worthless  and yet of preserving a safe conscience  I have often wished for some method by which a man might do himself and his deceased patron justice  without being under the hateful reproach of self conviction  After long lucubration  I have hit upon such an expedient  and send you the specimen of a poem upon the decease of a great man  in which the flattery is perfectly fine  and yet the poet perfectly innocent   On the Death of the Right Honourable       Ye muses  pour the pitying tear  For Pollio snatch d away   O had he liv d another year   —He had not dy d to day   O  were he born to bless mankind   In virtuous times of yore   Heroes themselves had fallen behind   —Whene er he went before   How sad the groves and plains appear   And sympathetic sheep   Even pitying hills would drop a tear   —If hills could learn to weep     165  His bounty in exalted strain  Each bard might well display   Since none implor d relief in vain   —That went reliev d away   And hark  I hear the tuneful throng   His obsequies forbid  He still shall live  shall live as long  ——As ever dead man did   LETTER CIV  To the same   IT is the most usual method in every report  first to examine its probability  and then act as the conjuncture may require  The English  however  exert a different spirit in such circumstances  they first act  and  when too late  begin to examine  From a knowledge of this disposition  there are several here who make it their business to frame new reports at every convenient interval  all tending to denounce ruin both on their cotemporaries and their posterity  This denunciation is eagerly caught up by the public  away they fling to propagate the distress  sell out at one place  buy in at another  grumble at their governors  shout in mobs  and when they have thus  for some time  behaved like fools  sit down coolly to argue and talk wisdom  to puzzle each other with syllogism  and prepare for the next report that prevails  which is always attended with the same success     166Thus are they ever rising above one report only to sink into another  They resemble a dog in a well  pawing to get free  When he has raised his upper parts above water  and every spectator imagines him disengaged  his lower parts drag him down again and sink him to the nose  he makes new efforts to emerge  and every effort increasing his weakness  only tends to sink him the deeper
