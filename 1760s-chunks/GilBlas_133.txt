and ordered his people to surround us  but he mended his opinion of us on the sound of our voices  and by favour of a dark lantern held up to the faces of Mendoza and Pacheco  His myrmidons  by his direction  examined the two men  whom our fancies had painted as in the agonies of death  but it turned out to be a fat licentiate with his servant  both of them overtaken in their cups  and not dead  but dead drunk  Gentlemen  exclaimed one of the posse  this jolly fellow is an acquaintance of mine  What  do you not know Signor Guyomer the licentiate  head of our university  With all his imperfections he is a great character  a man of superior genius  He is as staunch as a hound at a philosophical dispute  and his words flow like a gutter after a hail storm  He has but three foibles in which he indulges  intoxication  litigation  and fornication  He is now returning from supper at his Isabella s  whence  the more is the pity  the drunk was leading the drunk  and they both fell into the kennel  Before the good licentiate came to the headship this happened continually  Though manners make the man  honours  you perceive  do not always mend the manners  We left these drunkards in custody of the patrole  who carried them safe home  and betook ourselves to our lodging and our beds   Don Felix and Don Lewis were stirring about mid day  Aurora de Guzman was the first topic of their conversation  Gil Blas  said my mistress to me  run to my aunt  Donna Kimena  and ask if there is any admission for Signor Pacheco and me to day  we want to see my cousin  Off I went to acquit myself of this commission  or rather to concert the plan of the campaign with the duenna  We had no sooner laid our heads together to the purpose intended  than I was once more at the elbow of the false Mendoza  Sir  quoth I  your cousin Aurora has got about wonderfully  She enjoined me from her own lips to acquaint you  that your visit could not be otherwise than highly acceptable  and Donna Kimena desired me to assure Signor Pacheco  that any friend of yours would always meet with an hospitable reception   These last words evidently tickled Don Lewis s fancy  My mistress saw that the bait was swallowed  and prepared herself to haul the prey to shore  Just before dinner  a servant made his appearance from Signora Kimena  and said to Don Felix    My lord  a man from Toledo has been inquiring after you  and has left this note at your aunt s house  The pretended Mendoza opened it  and read the contents aloud to the following effect     If your father and family still live in your remembrance  and you wish to hear of their concerns  do not fail  on the receipt of this  to call at the Black Horse  near the university   I am too much interested  said he  in these proffered communications  not to satisfy my curiosity at once  Without ceremony  Pacheco  you must excuse me for the present  if I am not back again here within two hours  you may find your way by yourself to my aunt s  I will join the party in the evening  You recollect Gil Blas  message from Donna Kimena  the visit is no more than what will be expected from you  After having thrown out this hint  he left the room  and ordered me to follow him   It can scarcely be necessary to apprize the reader  that instead of marching down to the Black Horse  we filed off to our other quarters  The moment that we got within doors  Aurora tore off her artificial hair  washed the charcoal from her eyebrows  resumed her female attire  and shone in all her natural charms  a lovely dark complexioned girl  So complete indeed had been her disguise that Aurora and Don Felix could never have been suspected of identity  The lady seemed to have the advantage of the gentleman even in stature  thanks to a good high pair of heels  to which she was not a little indebted  It was her first business to heighten her personal graces with all the embellishments of art  after which she looked out for Don Lewis  in a state of agitation  compounded of fear and of hope  One instant she felt confident in her wit and beauty  the next she anticipated the failure of her attempt  Ortiz  on her part  set her best foot foremost  and was determined to play up to my mistress  As for me  Pacheco was not to see my knave s face till the last act of the farce  for which the great actors are always reserved  to unravel the intricacy of the plot  so I went out immediately after dinner   In short  the puppet show was all adjusted against Don Lewis s arrival  He experienced a very gracious reception from the old lady  in amends for whose tediousness he was blessed with two or three hours of Aurora s delightful conversation  When they had been together long enough  in popped I  with a message to the enamoured
