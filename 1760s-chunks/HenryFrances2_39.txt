over there some Day  on Purpose   I am surprized  that any Person of common Sense could mistake the Legacy  which he was so pleased with  Epistle I  Book V  for that from Curianus was the only one  which did him Honour  He says    A small Legacy is fallen to me   which shews  he was telling his Friend something new  And the former Legacy was above two Years before  at least  for he says  that the Suit  with the Coheirs  was of so long standing  The Mistake of the Commentator s could never have happened  but from the mere Force of Prejudice  which has amazing Powers  in many higher Instances  Pliny first speaks of Pomponia s Favour  to which it was natural to apply his Expressions of the Gratefulness of the Present  and  leaving the Reader in this Error  almost during the whole Letter  what he says at last  tho  it breaks with full Day upon you  could not open the Eyes of Prejudice     In the fourth Epistle you may see the extravagant Fees  which were given to Lawyers  in Pliny s Time  This may make us a little better Page  146 reconciled to the Extortion in our own Days  Though  to view this Matter in the Light of political Morality  the present Exorbitancy ought to alarm us extremely  for  the higher Law or Justice is vended  the scarcer it must be  and the Poor  who need it most  will  consequently  have least of it  Then Oppression reigns  and Liberty is no more  and then is a State in the proper Crisis for a Revolution  either by Rebellion at home  or Invasion from abroad  At the Time Pliny hints at this Extravagance  the great Roman Empire was hastening to it s Ruin   Adieu   Henry   LETTER CCXXIX   My dearest FANNY   Musaeum   OUR Assizes are over  and I am returned to myself  that is  to you  I wait not for the Pleasure of hearing from you  but amuse myself  in the mean Time  with the more imperfect one of writing to you  I am now retired among my Books  the best Part of which Library I esteem your Letters  for they not only teach me Wisdom  but promise me that glorious End  of which Wisdom is the surest Means  Happiness   Page  147I have read some Pages this Morning in the second Volume of Orrery s Pliny  but should not  at this Time  think of entertaining you out of this Author  if I had not from thence a fair Opportunity of addressing myself more particularly to my Heart s only Aim   You may remember  that you rallied me upon not taking Notice of Pliny s Epistles to Calpurnia  in my former Remarks  but I defended myself  upon there not being any in the first Volume  The fourth of the sixth Book  which is the first of the second Volume  is the first of these Epistles  I confess myself charmed with it  and am the more particularly fond of her  as  from the Hint of her Constitution and Make  she seems to resemble you  as you  in Return  do her in this  that I think you would deserve  on the like Occasion  a Letter full of the same Fondness  and Tenderness  and conjugal Regard  Whenever I raise a Statue to Pliny  I will have that whole Epistle inscribed on the Pedestal   The two first Lines of the fortieth Page contain a very fine and a just Sentiment  From the second Paragraph of the Comment upon this sixteenth Epistle  you may draw a Comparison between Pliny and Shakespeare  by observing  that the little Jingle  and affected Turns  in both their Writings  were rather the false Taste of their Age  than the Vices of the Authors   Page  148The Reflection in the seventeenth Epistle  that   he  who envies another  must be his Inferior   is fine     At the End of the Notes upon the fourth Epistle of the seventh Book  Lord Orrery wishes that this Letter had perished  I suppose  because it betrays a little Vanity about his trifling Performances in Poetry  He is very often angry at him  when he shews a Weakness of any Kind  because it is natural for us to wish those  we love or esteem for some Qualities  perfect in all  Now I am not quite so severe in this Matter   Non ego paucis offendor Maculis   Human Nature has many Foibles  and  when I perceive some in a great Character  I suppose I see the whole Man  but  when a perfect System is presented to me  I suspect the Genuineness of the whole  for  as I conclude a Part is acted somewhere  I think it possible it may be done throughout  Which gives me Occasion to remark upon the only Foible  I ever could object to my own Calpurnia  that I have now begun to consider it like a Tree or Shrub  which happens sometimes to be met with in forming the regular Alley of a Parterre  which  though it would be out of Rule to plant it
