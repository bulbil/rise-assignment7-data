had been presented  and it was not  long before he was heard to observe  at the club  that Pickle s sister  had not so much of the core of b   in her as he had imagined  This  negative compliment  by the medium of her brother  soon reached the  ears of Mrs  Grizzle  who  thus encouraged  redoubled in her arts and  attention  so that  in less than three months after  he in the same  place distinguished her with the epithet of a d  d sensible jade   Hatchway  taking the alarm at this declaration  which he feared  foreboded something fatal to his interest  told his commander  with a  sneer  that she had sense enough to bring him to under her stern  and he  did not doubt but that such an old crazy vessel would be the better for  being taken in tow   But howsomever   added this arch adviser   I d have  you take care of your upper works  for if once you are made fast to her  poop  egad  She ll spank it away  and make every beam in your body crack  with straining    Our she projector s whole plan had like to have been ruined by the  effect which this malicious hint had upon Trunnion  whose rage and  suspicion being wakened at once  his colour changed from tawny to a  cadaverous pale  and then shifting to a deep and dusky red  such as we  sometimes observe in the sky when it is replete with thunder  he  after  his usual preamble of unmeaning oaths  answered in these words    D    you  you jury legg d dog  you would give all the stowage in your hold to  be as sound as I am  and as for being taken in tow  d ye see  I m not  so disabled that I can lie my course  and perform my voyage without  assistance  and  egad  no man shall ever see Hawser Trunnion lagging  astern  in the wake of e er a b   in Christendom    Mrs  Grizzle  who every morning interrogated her brother with regard to  the subject of his night s conversation with his friends  soon received  the unwelcome news of the commodore s aversion to matrimony  and justly  imputing the greatest part of his disgust to the satirical insinuations    6 22 15  3 45 PM   of Mr  Hatchway  resolved to level this obstruction to her success  and  actually found means to interest him in her scheme  She had indeed  on  some occasions  a particular knack at making converts  being probably  not unacquainted with that grand system of persuasion which is adopted  by the greatest personages of the age  and fraught with maxims much  more effectual than all the eloquence of Tully or Demosthenes  even  when supported by the demonstrations of truth  besides  Mr  Hatchway s  fidelity to his new ally was confirmed by his foreseeing  in his  captain s marriage  an infinite fund of gratification for his own  cynical disposition  Thus  therefore  converted and properly cautioned   he for the future suppressed all the virulence of his wit against the  matrimonial state  and as he knew not how to open his mouth in the  positive praise of any person whatever  took all opportunities of  excepting Mrs  Grizzle  by name  from the censures he liberally bestowed  upon the rest of her sex   She is not a drunkard  like Nan Castick   of Deptford   he would say   not a nincompoop  like Peg Simper  of  Woolwich  not a brimstone  like Kate Koddle  of Chatham  nor a shrew   like Nell Griffin  on the Point  Portsmouth   ladies to whom  at  different times  they had both paid their addresses    but a tight   good humoured  sensible wench  who knows very well how to box her  compass  well trimmed aloft  and well sheathed alow  with a good cargo  under her hatches   The commodore at first imagined this commendation  was ironical  but  hearing it repeated again and again  was filled with  astonishment at this surprising change in the lieutenant s behaviour   and  after a long fit of musing  concluded that Hatchway himself  harboured a matrimonial design on the person of Mrs  Grizzle   Pleased with this conjecture  he rallied jack in his turn  and one night  toasted her health as a compliment to his passion  a circumstance which  the lady learned next day by the usual canal of her intelligence   and interpreting as the result of his own tenderness for her  she  congratulated herself on the victory she had obtained  and thinking  it unnecessary to continue the reserve she had hitherto industriously  affected  resolved from that day to sweeten her behaviour towards him  with such a dash of affection as could not fail to persuade him that  he had inspired her with a reciprocal flame  In consequence of this  determination  he was invited to dinner  and while he stayed treated
