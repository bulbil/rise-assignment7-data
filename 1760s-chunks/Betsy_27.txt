he finding the opportunity he had of being revenged  soon turned   his humble adoration into an air more free and natural to him  As she   was opening her mouth to utter some sarcasm or other  he catched her in   his arms  and began to kiss her with so much warmth and eagerness that   surprized her  she struggled to get loose  and called Miss Flora  not   knowing she was gone  to come to her assistance  The efforts she made at   first to oblige him to desist  were not  however  quite so strenuous as   they ought to have been on such an occasion  but finding he was about to   proceed to greater liberties than any man before had ever taken with   her  she collected all her strength  and broke from him  when looking   round the room  and seeing nobody there   Bless me   cried she   what is   the meaning of all this  Where are our friends     They are gone   said   he   to pay the debt which love and youth  and beauty challenge  let us   not be remiss  nor waste the precious moments in idle scruples  Come  my   angel   pursued he  endeavouring to get her once more into his arms     make me the happiest of mankind  and be as divinely good as you are   fair         I do not understand you  Sir   replied she   but neither desire  nor   will stay to hear  an explanation   She spoke this with somewhat of an   haughty air  and was making towards the door  but he was far from being   intimidated  and  instead of suffering her to pass  he seized her a   little roughly with one hand  and with the other made fast the door     Come  come  my dear creature   cried he   no more resistance  you see   you are in my power  and the very name of being so is sufficient to   absolve you to yourself  for any act of kindness you may bestow upon me    be generous  then  and be assured it shall be an inviolable secret        She was about to say something  but he stopped her mouth with kisses    and forced her to sit down in a chair  where  holding her fast  her ruin   had certainly been compleated  if a loud knocking at the door had not   prevented him from prosecuting his design       This was the brother of Miss Betsy  who having been at her lodgings  on   his coming from thence met the footman  who had been sent to acquaint   the family the ladies would not dine at home  he asked where his sister   was  and  the fellow having told him  came directly to the place  A   waiter of the house shewed him to the room  on finding it locked he was   strangely amazed  and both knocked and called to have it opened  with a   great deal of vehemence       This gentleman commoner knowing his voice  was shocked to the last   degree  but quitted that instant his intended prey  and let him enter    Mr  Francis  on coming in  knew not what to think  he saw the gentleman   in great disorder  and his sister in much more   What is the meaning of   this   said he   Sister  how came you here     Ask me no questions at   present   replied she  scarce able to speak  so strangely had her late   fright seized on her spirits   but see me safe from this cursed house    and that worst of men   Her speaking in this manner made Mr  Francis   apprehend the whole  and perhaps more than the truth   How  Sir   said   he  darting a furious look at the gentleman commoner   what is it I   hear   Have you dared to     Whatever I have dared to   interrupted the   other   I am capable of defending     It is well   rejoined the brother   of Miss Betsy   perhaps I may put you to the trial  but this is not a   time or place   He then took hold of his sister s hand  and led her down   stairs  as they were going out  Miss Betsy stopping a little to adjust   her dress  which was strangely disordered  she bethought herself of Miss   Flora  who  though she was very angry with  she did not chuse to leave   behind at the mercy of such rakes  as she had reason to think those were   whom she had been in company with  Just as she was desiring of her
