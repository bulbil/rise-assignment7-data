While he was at college  Swift prophesied wonders of him only      regretting that his talent pointed towards poetry  which of     all pursuits was most unprofitable   The Dean  says Brookiana      when he saw how thoroughly modest and unpretending he was       never asked his opinion of any matter which was beyond his     power  or which might embarrass him   The artless vivacity     and sweetness of the lad seems to have softened even that cruel     heart  It utterly captivated  in the next few years  men of equal     talent and of more humanity  When he went to study law in     London  in 1724  he became at once the pet of Pope and Lyttleton       and one of the few really important things in Brookiana are a     few letters selected from a correspondence between Brooke and     Pope  which lasted for many years  Where are these letters now       Would that the Editor had given them all  even though  to make     room for them  he had consigned to obscurity a dozen of Irish     worthies  Brooke  in one of them written in 1739  is very solicitous     about Pope s religious tenets  having heard it insinuated that he      had too much wit to be a man of religion  and too much refine      ment to be that trifling thing called a Christian   which Pope     answers satisfactorily enough  sending him a  vindication of the     Essay on Man from the aspersions and mistakes of Mr  Crousaz             PREFACE  xli     and saying  for himself  that he   sincerely worships God  believes   in his revelations  resigns to his dispensations  loves all his creatures    is in charity with all denominations of Christians  however violently   they treat each other  and detests none so much as that profligate   race who would loosen the bands of morality  either under the   pretence of religion or free thinking  I hate no man as a man    but I hate vice in any man   I hate no sect  but I hate unchari    tableness in any sect  This much I say  merely in compliance   with your desire that I should say something of myself  a   confession of faith which will not surprise the few who still consider    with Henry Brooke  the Essay on Man to be one of the noblest   didactic poems in the English language      It is worth while to remark  in these letters  first the high terms   in which Pope speaks of young Brooke   of his   modesty unspoilt   by applause   his  good qualities of the heart as well as of the   head   his  always honourable ends   and next  the absolute   worship with which Brooke regards Pope apologizing to him  in   one place  for having confessed that   Virgil gave me equal pleasure    Homer equal warmth  Shakspeare greater rapture  Milton more   astonishment   so ungrateful was I to refuse you your due praise    when it was not unknown to me that I got friends and reputation   by your saying of me things which no one would have thought   I merited  had not you said them  But I spoke without book   at the time  I had not been entered into the spirit of your   works  and I believe there are few who have          Any   one of your original writings is indisputably a more finished   piece than has been wrote by any other man  There is one   consistent genius through the whole of your works  but that   genius seems the smaller by being divided          Each   distinct performance is the performance of a separate author  no   one being large enough to contain you in your full dimensions     and much more  at which we may smile now  and possibly  if   we be men of the world  hint that the young author did not   worship the great literary star for nothing  Perhaps  nevertheless     the whirligig of time may bring round its revenges   and   Alexander Pope be rated  if not as high as young Brooke sets   him  yet still far more highly than now  And mean while  is it   not in the nature of all noble young souls to worship a great   man  when they can find him  And ought it not to be in their   nature  Is there any feeling more ennobling  there are few more   delightful  than that of looking
