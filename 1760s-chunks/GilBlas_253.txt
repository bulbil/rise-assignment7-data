all the conceits  engendered by a merry nature and an eccentric course of life  when two magpies perched on the trees above us  Their clack and clatter was so obstreperous  as to force our attention whether we would or no  These birds  said the duke  seem to be in dudgeon with one another  I should like to learn the cause of their quarrel  My lord  said I  your curiosity reminds me of an Indian story in Pilpay or some other fabulist  The minister insisted on the particulars  and I related them in the following terms   There reigned in Persia a good monarch  who not being blessed with capacities of sufficient compass to govern his dominions in his own person  left the care of them to his grand vizier  That minister  whose name was Atalmuc  was possessed of first rate talents  He supported the weight of that unwieldy monarchy  without sinking under the burden  He preserved it in profound peace  His art consisted in uniting the love of the royal authority with the reverence of it  while the people at large looked up to the vizier as to an affectionate father  though a devoted servant of his prince  Atalmuc had a young Cachemirian among his secretaries  by name Zeangir  to whom he was particularly attached  He took pleasure in his conversation  invited him frequently to the chase  and opened to him his most secret thoughts  One day as they were hunting together in a wood  the vizier  at the croaking of two ravens on a tree  said to his secretary    I should like to know what those birds are talking about in their jargon  My lord  answered the Cachemirian  your wishes may be fulfilled  Indeed  How so  replied Atalmuc  Because  rejoined Zeangir  a dervise read in many mysteries  has taught me the language of birds  If you wish it  I will lay my ear close to these  and will repeat to you word for word whatever they may happen to say   The vizier agreed to the proposal  The Cachemirian got near the ravens  and affected to suck in their discourse  Then  returning to his master  My lord  said he  would you believe it  We are ourselves the topic of their talk  Impossible  exclaimed the Persian minister  Prithee now  what do they say of us  One of the two  replied the secretary  spoke thus  Here he is  the very man  the grand vizier Atalmuc  the guardian eagle of Persia  hovering over her like the parent bird over its nest  watching without intermission for the safety of its brood  For the purpose of unbending from his wearisome toils  he is hunting in this wood with his faithful Zeangir  How happy must that secretary be  to serve so partial and indulgent a master  Fair and softly  observed the other raven shrewdly  fair and softly  Make not too much parade about that Cachemirian s happiness  Atalmuc  it is true  talks and jokes familiarly with him  honours him with his confidence  and may very possibly intend to signalize his friendship by a lucrative post  but between the cup and the lip Zeangir may perish with thirst  The poor devil lodges in a ready  furnished apartment  where there is not an article of furniture for his use  In a word  he leads a starving life  with all the paraphernalia of a plump fed courtier  The grand vizier never troubles his head about inquiring into the right or wrong of his affairs  but satisfied with empty good wishes towards him  leaves his favourite within the ruthless gripe of poverty   I stopped here  to see how the Duke of Lerma would take it  and he asked me with a smile what effect the fable had produced on the mind of Atalmuc  and whether the grand vizier had not felt a little offended at the secretary s presumption  No  my noble lord  answered I  with some little embarrassment at the question  historians say that his ingenuity was amply rewarded  He was more lucky than discreet  replied the duke with a serious air  there are some ministers who would esteem it no joke to be lectured at that rate  But the king will not be long before he is getting up  my duty demands my attendance  After this hint he walked off with hasty strides towards the palace without throwing away a word more upon me  and to all appearance in high dudgeon at my Indian parable   I followed him up to the very door of his majesty s chamber  and went thence to arrange my papers in the places whence they had been taken  Then I entered a closet where our two copying secretaries were at work  for they also were of the migratory party  What is the matter with you  Signor de Santillane  said they at the sight of me  You are quite down in the mouth  Has anything untoward happened   I was too much mortified at the ill success of my narrative  to be cautious in the expression of my grief  On the recital of what had passed with the duke  they sympathized in my disappointment You have some reason to fret  said one of them  Heaven grant you may be better treated than a secretary
