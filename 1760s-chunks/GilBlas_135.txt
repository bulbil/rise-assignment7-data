to the combustible heart of Don Lewis  Kimena  a veteran performer  took the cue of sympathy at every expression of tenderness  and promised the enamoured youth that it should not be her fault if his plea with her niece was urged in vain  Pacheco threw himself at the feet of so good an aunt  and thanked her for all her favours  In this stage of the business Don Felix asked if his cousin was up  No  replied the Duenna  she is still in bed  and is not likely to be down stairs while you stay  but call again after dinner  and you shall have a tête à tête with her to your heart s content  It is easy to imagine that so coming on a proposal from the dragon which was to guard this inaccessible treasure  produced its full complement of joy in the heart of Don Lewis  The remainder of the long morning had nothing to do but to be sworn at  He went back to his own lodging with Mendoza  who was not a little enraptured to observe  with the scrutinizing eye of a mistress under the disguise of a friend  all the symptoms of an incurable amorous infirmity   Their tongues ran on no earthly subject but Aurora  When they had done dinner  Don Felix said to Pacheco    A thought has just struck me  It would not be amiss for me to go to my aunt s a few minutes before you  I will get to speak to my cousin in private  and pry  if it be possible  into every fold and winding of her heart  as far as your interests are concerned  Don Lewis just chimed in with this idea  so that he suffered his friend to set out first  and did not follow him till an hour afterwards  My mistress availed herself so diligently of the interval  that she was tricked out as a lady from heel to point before the arrival of her lover  I beg pardon         said the poor abused inamorato  after having paid his compliments to Aurora and the Duenna         I took it for granted Don Felix would be here  You will see him in a few seconds  answered Donna Kimena  he is writing in my closet  Pacheco was easily put off with the excuse  and found his time pass cheerfully in conversation with the ladies  And yet  notwithstanding the presence of all his soul held dear  it seemed very strange that hour after hour glided away but no Mendoza stepped forth from the closet  He could not help remarking  that the gentleman s correspondence must be unusually voluminous  when Aurora s features all at once assumed the broader contour of a laugh  with a delightfully provoking question to Don Lewis    Is it possible that love can be so blind as not to detect the glaring imposition by which it has been deluded  Has my real self made so faint an impression on your senses  that a flaxen peruke and a pencilled eyebrow could carry the farce to such a height as this  But the masquerade is over now  Pacheco  continued she  resuming an air of gravity  you are to learn that Don Felix de Mendoza and Aurora de Guzman are but one and the same person   It was not enough to discover to him all the springs and contrivances by which he had been duped  she confessed the motives of tender partiality that led her to the attempt  and detailed the progress of the plot to the winding up of the catastrophe  Don Lewis scarcely knew whether to be most astonished or delighted at the recital  at my mistress s feet he thus uttered the transports of his fond applause    Ah  lovely Aurora  can I believe myself indeed the happy mortal on whom your favours have been so lavished  What can I do to make you amends for them  My affection  were this life eternal  could scarcely pay the price  These pretty speeches were followed by a thousand others of the same quality and texture  after which the lovers descended a little nearer to common sense  and began planning the rational and human means of arriving at the accomplishment of their wishes  It was resolved that we should set out without loss of time for Madrid  where marriage was to drop the curtain on the last act of our comedy  This purpose was executed in the spirit of impatience which conceived it  so that Don Lewis was united to my mistress in a fortnight  and the nuptial ceremonies were graced with the usual accompaniments of music  feasting  balls  and rejoicings  without either end or respite       CH  VII    Gil Blas leaves his place and goes into the service of Don Gonzales Pacheco   THREE weeks after marriage  my mistress bethought herself of rewarding the services I had rendered her  She made me a present of a hundred pistoles  telling me at the same time    Gil Blas  my good fellow  it is not that I mean to turn you away  for you have my free leave to stay here as long as you please  but my husband has an uncle  Don Gonzales Pacheco  who wants you very much for a valet de chambre  I have
