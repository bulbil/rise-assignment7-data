become our choice   I bowed to the generous nobleman  She kneeled  Best and most indulgent of fathers  taking his hand  and kissing it  let me thank you for bearing with me as you have done  What trouble have I given you —All the business of my future life shall be to shew my gratitude  and my obedience to your will  The Marchioness then tenderly raising her  took her to the farther end of the room  They talked low  but we heard all they said  You were so very indifferent all day yesterday  and last night  said the Marchioness  that I would not disturb you  Love  for fear of breaking your rest  else I would have told you  how desirous now we all are  of an alliance with the Chevalier Grandison  No other way can he be rewarded for his goodness to us all   Permit me  madam  answered Clementina  to give Page  155 you the motives of my present conduct  of my selfdenial  such is my value for the Chevalier  I will call it so  If I thought I could make the generous man happy  if I thought I should not rather punish than reward him  if I thought I could be happy  in myself  and my soul would not be endangered  if I thought I could make you and my papa happy  by giving my hand to him  God knows that my heart would not make the least scruple  But  madam  the Almighty has laid his hand upon me  My head is not yet as it should be  and  before I took my resolution  I considered every thing  as much as my poor shattered reason would permit me to consider it  This was the way I took—I prayed that God would direct me  I put myself in the situation of another person  who circumstanced as I was  I supposed  came to me for advice  I saw plainly  that I could not deserve the Chevalier  because I could not think as he thought  in the most important of all articles  and there was no likelihood of his thinking as I thought  I prayed for fortitude  I doubted myself  I altered and altered what I had written  But still all my alterations ran one way  It was against my own wishes  So this I took for an answer to my prayers  I transcribed it fair  but still I doubted myself  I would not consult you  madam  You had declared for the Chevalier  That would not have been to do justice to the question before me  and to the divine impulse by which I was determined to be governed  if my prayers for it should be answered  I let not Camilla know my struggles  I besought the assistance of the Blessed Virgin to favour an unhappy maid  whose heart was in her duty  but whose head was disturbed  It was suggested to me what to do  Yet I would not send to the Chevalier what I had written  I still doubted my heart  And thought I never should be able to give him the paper  At last I resolved  But when he came  my heart recoiled  He could not but see the Page  156 distress I was in  I am sure I met with his pity  Could I but give him the paper  thought I  my difficulty would be over  for then I am sure  almost sure that  seeing my scruples  and the rectitude of my purpose  he will himself generously support me in my resolution  At last I gave the paper to him  And now let me say  that I verily think I shall be easier in my mind  if I can be allowed to adhere to the contents  yet not be thought ungrateful  Dear blessed Grandison  turning to me  read once more that paper  And then if you will not  if you cannot  set me free  I will obey my friends  and make you as happy as I can   She turned from every one  and fell upon her knees  Great God  I thank thee  said she for this serene moment   Serene as the noble enthusiast thought her mind  I saw it was too high set  From the turn of her eyes I feared a relapse  It was owing to her greatness of mind  her reason and her love combating with each other  that she ever was disordered  I approached her—Admirable Lady  said I  be you free  Whatever be my destiny  be you  for me  what you wish to be  If you are well and happy  I will  if possible  make myself so   Dear Grandison  said the Bishop  coming up to me  and taking my hand  how do I admire you  But can you be thus great   Shall I not emulate  my Lord  such an example set by a woman  I came over without any interested views  I considered myself  indeed  as bound by the conditions to which I had formerly yielded  but Lady Clementina and your family as free  When I was encouraged to hope  I did hope  I will now  though with deep regret  go back to my former situation
