ministry  and no¦thing but loyalty breathed throughout the whol kingdom  The administration of affairs being com¦mitted to the Earl of Harrington  the Earl of Chester¦field  and others  who enjoyed a great share of po¦pularity  the views of the crown were no longe thwarted by an opposition in parliament  The Admiral Rowley and Warren had retrieved the honour of th British flag  and made several rich captures  Louis¦burg in the island of Cape Breton  in North Ame¦rica  a place of great consequence to the Britis commerce  surrendered to General Pepperel  whil a short time after  two French East India ships  an another from Peru laden with treasure  supposing th place still in possession of the French  sailed into th harbour  and their capture added to the English suc¦cess  It was in this period of universal satisfactio that the son of the old Pretender resolved to mak  175 an effort at gaining the British crown  Young Charles Edward  the adventurer in question  had been bred in a luxurious court without sharing its effeminacy  he was enterprising and ambitious  but  either from inexperience  or natural inability  utterly unequal to the undertaking  He was flattered by the rash  the superstitious  and the needy  that the kingdom was ripe for a revolt  that the people could no longer bear the immense load of taxes  which was daily increasing  and that the most considerable persons in the kingdom would gladly seize the opportunity of crowding to his standard  Being furnished with some money  and still larger promises from France  who fanned this ambition in him  from which they hoped to gain some advantages  he embarked for Scotland on board a small frigate  accompanied by the Marquis Tullibardine  Sir  Thomas Sheridan  and a few other desperate adventurers  For the conquest of the whole British empire he brought with him seven officers  and arms for two thousand men  Fortune  which ever persecuted his family  seemed no way more favourable to him  his convoy  a ship of sixty guns  was so disabled in an engagement with an English man of war  called the Lion  that it returned to Brest  while he was obliged to continue his course to the western parts of Scotland  and  landing on the coast of Lochaber  he was  in a little time  joined by some chiefs of the Highland Clans  and their vassals  These chiefs had ever continued to exercise an hereditary jurisdiction over all their tenants  This power of life and death vested in the Lords of the manor  was a privilege of the old feudal law  long abolished in England  but which had been confirmed to the Scotch lairds at the time of the union  From hence we see  that a chief had the power of commanding all his vassals  and that immediate death was the consequence of their disobeyng  By means of these chiefs therefore he soon   176 saw himself at the head of fifteen hundred men  and invited others to join him by his manifestoes  which were dispersed throughout all the Highlands   The boldness of this enterprize astonished all Europe  it awakened the fears of the pusillanimous  the pity of the wise  and the loyalty of all  The whole kingdom seemed unanimously bent upon opposing the enterprize  which they were sensible  as being supported only by Papists  would be instrumental in restoring Popery  The ministry was no sooner confirmed of the truth of his arrival  which  at first  they could scarely be induced to believe  than Sir John Cope was ordered to oppose his progress  In the mean time  the young adventurer marched to Perth  where the unnecessary ceremony was performed of proclaiming the Chevalier de St  George  his father  King of Great Britain  The rebel army  descending from the mountains  seemed to gather as it went  They advanced towards Edinburgh  which they entered without opposition  Here too the pageantry of proclamation was performed  in which he promised to dissolve the union  and redress the grievances of the country  But  though he was master of the capital  yet the citadel  which goes by the name of the Castle  a strong fortress built upon a rock  and commanded by General Guest  braved all his attempts  In the mean time  Sir John Cope  who had pursued them to the Highlands  but declined meeting them in their descent  now reinforced by two regiments of dragoons  resolved to march towards Edinburgh  and give them battle  The young adventurer  unwilling to give him time to retreat  attacked him near Preston pans  about twelve miles from the capital  and  in a few minutes  put him and his troops totally to the route  This victory  in which the King lost about five hundred men  gave the rebels great influence  and  had the Pretender taken advantage of the general consternation    177 and marched towards England  the consequence might have been dangerous to the safety of the state  but he spent the time at Edinburgh  seeming to enjoy the useless parade of royalty  pleased at being addressed and treated as a King  By this time he was joined by the Earl of Kilmarnock  the Lords Elcho  Balmerino  Ogilvy  Pitsligo  and the eldest son of the Lord Lovat  This Lord Lovat was
