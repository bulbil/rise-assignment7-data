this Bagenhall    170 There is such a man  and he is a man of pleasure  as  Sir John Allestree informs me—Accursed villain  this Wilson  He could not bear with his master s constant bad hours  and profligate course of life  as he told our servants  and Mrs  Sarah —Spacious impostor   One o Clock   LADY Betty s chairmen have sound out  and they brought with them  one of the fellows whom that vile Wilson hired  The other was afraid to come  I have secured this fellow  Yet he seems to be ingenuous  and I have promised  that if he prove innocent  he shall be rewarded instead of punish d  and the two chairmen  on this promise  are gone to try to prevail upon his partner to come  were it but to release the other  as both insisted upon their innocence   And now will you be impatient to know what account this fellow gives   O Mr  Selby  The dear  dear creature—But before I can proceed  I must recover my eyes   Two o Clock   THIS fellow s name is Macpherson  His partner s Mc Dermot  This is Macpherson s account of the matter   Wilson hired them to carry this young Lady to Paddington—To Paddington  A vile dog —  They objected distance and danger  the latter  as Macpherson owns  to highten the value of the service   As to the danger  Wilson told him  they would be met by three others of his fellow servants  armed  at the first fields  And as to the distance  they would be richl• rewarded  and he gave them a crown a piece earnest  and treated them besides with brandy   To prevent their curiosity  and entirely to remove their difficulties  the villain told them  that his young Lady was an heiress  and had agreed to go off from the Masquerade with her lover  But that the gentleman   171 would not appear to them till she came to the very house  to which she was to be conveyed   She thinks  said the hellish villain  that she is to be carried to May Fair Chapel  and to be married directly  and that the minister  unseasonable as the hour is  will be there in readiness  But the gentleman  who is a man of the utmost honour  intends first to try whether he cannot obtain her friend s consent  So when she finds her way lengthened  proceeded the vile wretch  she will perhaps be frightned  and will ask me questions  I would not for the world disoblige her  but here she must be cheated for her own sake  and when all is over  will value me the more for the innocent imposture  But whatever orders she may give you  observe none but mine  and follow me  You shall be richly rewarded  repeated the miscreant  Should she even cry out  mind it not  She is full of fears  and hardly holds in one mind for an hour together   He further cautioned them not to answer any questions which might possibly be ask d of them  by the person who should conduct his young Lady to her chair  but refer to himself  And in case any other chairs were to go in company with hers  he bid them fall behind  and follow his flambeaux   Macpherson says  that she drew the curtains close  because of her dress  no doubt  the moment I had lest her  after seeing her in the chair   The fellows thus prepossessed and instructed  speeded away  without stopping for our chairs  Yet the dear creature must have heard me give that direction   They had carried her a great way before she called out  and then she called three times before they would hear her  At the third time they stopt  and her servant asked her commands  Where am I  William  said she  Just at home  madam  answered he  Surely you have taken a strange round about way  We are  172 come about  said the rascal  on purpose to avoid the croud of chairs and coaches   They proceeded onwards  and were joined by three men  as Wilson had told them they would  but they fansied one of them to be a gentleman  for he was muffled up in a cloak  and had a silver hilted sword in his hand  But he spoke not  He gave no directions  And all three kept aloof  that they might not be seen by her   At Maribone  she again called out  William  William  said she  with vehemence  The Lord have mercy upon me  Where are you going to carry me  Chairmen  stop  Stop  chairmen  Set me down —William —Call my servant  chairmen —  Dear soul  Her servant  Her devil   The chairmen called him  They lifted up the head  The side curtains were still undrawn  and Mc Dermot stood so close  that she could not see far before her  Did you not tell me  said the villain to them  that it was not far about —See how you have frighted my Lady —Madam  we are now almost at home   They
