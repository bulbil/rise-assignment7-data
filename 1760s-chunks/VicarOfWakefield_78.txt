when we reflect on the various schemes this gentleman laid to seduce innocence  perhaps some one more artful than the rest has been found able to deceive him  When we consider what numbers he has ruined  how many parents now feel with anguish the infamy and the contamination which he has brought into their families  it would not surprise me if some one of them—Amazement  Do I see my lost daughter  Do I hold her  It is  it is my life  my happiness  I thought thee lost  my Olivia  yet still I hold thee—and still shalt thou live to bless me    —The warmest transports of the fondest lover were not greater than mine when I saw him introduce my child  and held my daughter in my arms  whose silence only spoke her raptures    And art thou returned to me  my darling    cried I    to be my comfort in age    —   That she is    cried Jenkinson    and make much of her  for she is your  Page  207  own honourable child  and as honest a woman as any in the whole room  let the other be who she will  And as for you  Squire  as sure as you stand there this young lady is your lawful wedded wife  And to convince you that I speak nothing but truth  here is the licence by which you were married together    —So saying  he put the licence into the Baronet s hands  who read it  and found it perfect in every respect    And now  gentlemen    continued he    I find you are surprised at all this  but a few words will explain the difficulty  That there  Squire of renown  for whom I have a great friendship  but that s between ourselves  has often employed me in doing odd little things for him  Among the rest  he commissioned me to procure him a false licence and a false priest  in order to deceive this young lady  But as I was very much his friend  what did I do but went and got a true licence and a true priest   Page  208  and married them both as fast as the cloth could make them  Perhaps you ll think it was generosity that made me do all this  But no  To my shame I confess it  my only design was to keep the licence and let the  Squire know that I could prove it upon him whenever I thought proper  and so make him come down whenever I wanted money    A burst of pleasure now seemed to fill the whole apartment  our joy reached even to the common room  where the prisoners themselves sympathized   And shook their chains  In transport and rude harmony   Happiness expanded upon every face  and even Olivia s cheek seemed flushed with pleasure  To be thus restored to reputation  to friends and fortune at once  was a rapture sufficient to stop the progress of decay and restore former health and vivacity  But perhaps among all there was not one  Page  209  who felt sincerer pleasure than I  Still holding the dear loved child in my arms  I asked my heart if these transports were not delusion     How could you    cried I  turning to Mr  Jenkinson    how could you add to my miseries by the story of her death  But it matters not  my pleasure at finding her again  is more than a recompence for the pain     As to your question    replied Jenkinson    that is easily answered  I thought the only probable means of freeing you from prison  was by submitting to the  Squire  and consenting to his marriage with the other young lady  But these you had vowed never to grant while your daughter was living  there was therefore no other method to bring things to bear but by persuading you that she was dead  I prevailed on your wise to join in the deceit  and we have not had a fit opportunity of undeceiving you till now    Page  210  In the whole assembly now there only appeared two faces that did not glow with transport  Mr  Thornhill s assurance had entirely forsaken him  he now saw the gulph of infamy and want before him  and trembled to take the plunge  He therefore fell on his knees before his uncle  and in a voice of piercing misery implored compassion  Sir William was going to spurn him away  but at my request he raised him  and after pausing a few moments      Thy vices  crimes  and ingratitude    cried he    deserve no tenderness  yet thou shalt not be entirely forsaken  a bare competence shall be supplied  to support the wants of life  but not its follies  This young lady  thy wife  shall be put in possession of a third part of that fortune which once was thine  and from her tenderness alone thou art to expect any extraordinary supplies for the future    He was going to express his gratitude for such kindness in a set speech  but the  Page
