an only daughter  who being sickly and decrepid  intends to drink the waters for the recovery of her health —Her father  who was a rich Turkey merchant  died about a year ago  and left her with a fortune of twenty thousand pounds  under the sole management of her mother  who is my kinswoman —I would have put in for the plate myself  but there is a breach at present between the old woman and me —You must know  that some time ago I borrowed a small sum of her  and promised  it seems  to pay it before a certain time  but being disappointed in my expectation of money from the country  the day clapsed  without my being able to take up my note  upon which she wrote a peremptory letter  threatning to arrest me  if I did not pay the debt immediately  Nettled at this precise behaviour  I sent a damned severe answer  which enraged her so much  that she actually took out a writ against me —Whereupon  finding the thing grow serious  I got a friend to advance the money for me  discharged the debt  went to her house  and abused her for unfriendly dealing —She was provoked by my reproaches  and scolded in her turn  The little deformed urchin joined her mother with such virulence and volubility of tongue  that I was fain to make my retreat  after having been honoured with a great many scandalous epithets  which gave   184 me plainly to understand that I had nothing to hope from the esteem of the one  or the affection of the other —As they are both utter strangers to life  it is a thousand to one that the girl shall be picked up by some scoundrel or other at Bath  if I don t provide for her otherwise —You are a well looking sellow  Random  and can behave as demurely as a quaker —Now if you will give me an obligation for five hundred pounds  to be paid six months after your marriage  I will put you in a method of carrying her in spite of all opposition      This proposal was too advantageous for me  to be refused  The writing was immediately drawn and executed  and Banter giving me notice of the time when  and the stage coach in which they were to set out  I bespoke a place in the same convenience  and having hired a horse for Strap  who was charmed with the project  set out accordingly   As we embarked before day  I had not the pleasure for some time of seeing Miss Snapper  that was the name of my mistress  nor even of perceiving the number and sex of my fellowtravellers  although I guessed that the coach was full  by the difficulty I found in seating myself —The first five minutes passed in a general silence  when all of a sudden  the coach heeling to one side  a boisterous voice pronounced     To the right and left  cover your flanks  damme    I easily discovered by the tone and matter of this exclamation  that it was uttered by a son of Mars  neither was it hard to conceive the profession of another person  who sat opposite to me  and observed  that we ought to have been well satisfied of   185 the security  before we entered upon the premises —These two sallies had not the desired effect  We continued a good while as mute as before  till at length  the gentleman of the sword  impatient of longer silence  made a second effort  by swearing  he had got into a meeting of quakers —   I believe so too   said a shrill female voice  at my left hand  for the spirit of solly begins to move  —   Out with it then  madam    replied the soldier  —   You seem to have no occasion for a midwife    cried the lady  —   D—n my blood   exclaimed the other  a man can t talk to a woman  but she immediately thinks of a midwife  —   True  Sir   said she  I long to be delivered     —What  of a mouse  madam    said he  —   No  Sir   said she  of a fool  —   Are you far gone with fool    said he  —   Little more than two miles    said she  —   By Gad  you re a wit  madam    cried the officer —   I wish I could with any justice return the compliment    said the lady  —   Zounds  I have done    said he  —   Your bolt is soon shot  according to the proverb    said she  —  The warrior s powder was quite spent  the lawyer advised him to drop the prosecution  and a grave matron  who sat on the left hand of the victorious wit  told her  she must not let her tongue run so fast among strangers —This reprimand softened with the appellation of child  convinced me that the satyrical lady was no other than Miss Snapper  and resolved to regulate my conduct accordingly
