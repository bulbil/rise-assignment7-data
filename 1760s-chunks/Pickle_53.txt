of thy      benevolence melt the icy emanations of thy disdain  which hath      frozen up the spirits of angelic pre eminence   Thy most      egregious admirer and superlative slave                                         Peregrine Pickle    Never was astonishment more perplexing than that of Emilia  when she  read this curious composition  which she repeated verbatim three times  before she would credit the evidence of her own senses  She began to  fear in good earnest that love had produced a disorder in her lover s  understanding  but after a thousand conjectures by which she attempted  to account for this extraordinary fustian of style  she concluded that  it was the effect of mere levity  calculated to ridicule the passion he  had formerly professed  Irritated by this supposition  she resolved    6 22 15  3 45 PM   to balk his triumph with affected indifference  and in the mean time  endeavoured to expel him from that place which he possessed within her  heart  And indeed such a victory over her inclinations might have been  obtained without great difficulty  for she enjoyed an easiness of temper  that could accommodate itself to the emergencies of her fate  and her  vivacity  by amusing her imagination  preserved herself from the keener  sensations of sorrow  Thus determined and disposed  she did not send  any sort of answer  or the least token of remembrance by Pipes  who  was suffered to depart with a general compliment from the mother  and  arrived at Winchester the next day   Peregrine s eyes sparkled when he saw his messenger come in  and he  stretched out his hand in full confidence of receiving some particular  mark of his Emilia s affection  but how was he confounded  when he found  his hope so cruelly disappointed  In an instant his countenance fell   He stood for some time silent and abashed  then thrice repeated the  interrogation of  What  not one word from Emilia   and dubious of his  courier s discretion  inquired minutely into all the particulars of his  reception  He asked if he had seen the young lady  if she was in good  health  if he had found an opportunity of delivering his letter  and how  she looked  when he put it into her hand  Pipes answered  that he had  never seen her in better health or better spirits  that he had managed  matters so as not only to present the billet unperceived  but also to  ask her commands in private before he took his leave  when she told him  that the letter required no reply  This last circumstance he considered  as a manifest mark of disrespect  and gnawed his lips with resentment   Upon further reflection  however  he supposed that she could not  conveniently write by the messenger  and would undoubtedly favour him by  the post  This consideration consoled him for the present  and he waited  impatiently for the fruits of his hope  but after he had seen eight  days elapse without reaping the satisfaction with which he had flattered  himself  his temper forsook him  he raved against the whole sex  and was  seized with a fit of sullen chagrin  but his pride in a little time came  to his assistance  and rescued him from the horrors of the melancholy  fiend  He resolved to retort her own neglect upon her ungrateful  mistress  his countenance gradually resumed its former serenity  and  though by this time he was pretty well cured of his foppery  he appeared  again at public diversions with an air of gaiety and unconcern  that  Emilia might have a chance of hearing how much  in all likelihood  he  disregarded her disdain   There are never wanting certain officious persons  who take pleasure in  promoting intelligence of this sort  His behaviour soon reached the ears  of Miss Gauntlet  and confirmed her in the opinion she had conceived  from his letter  so that she fortified herself in her former sentiments   and bore his indifference with great philosophy  Thus a correspondence   which had commenced with all the tenderness and sincerity of love   and every promise of duration  was interrupted in its infancy by a  misunderstanding occasioned by the simplicity of Pipes  who never once  reflected upon the consequences of his deceit   Though their mutual passion was by these means suppressed for the  present  it was not altogether extinguished  but glowed in secret   though even to themselves unknown  until an occasion  which afterwards  offered  blew up the latent flame  and love resumed his empire in  their breasts  While they moved  as it were  without the sphere of each  other s attraction  the commodore  hearing that Perry was in danger of    6 22 15  3 45 PM   involving himself in some pernicious engagement  resolved  by advice  of Mr  Jolter and his friend the parish priest  to recall him
