a Man must be a God  or a Brute  who can live alone  Be it so  but surely the Contemplation of Virtue  Truth  and Nature  being the highest Entertainment of Angels  may enable a philosophick Mind to support Retirement  without Hanging  or Drowning  Mere Solitude  or even the most learned Leisure  is said to unqualify a Man for the Commerce  or even the Conversation of the World  and perhaps it does —but this Objection is only from them to you  not from you to yourself  Dancing may be a necessary Accomplishment for the Stage  but why shall a Man practise Coupees  who only means to walk  Such Hints as these should make a virtuous Mind the more inamoured of Fields and Groves  for sure it is a high Recommendation of Truth and Honesty  that the first would disappoint a Courtier s Preferment  and the latter mar an Attorney s Fortune       285I read over a long Chapter in Montaigne Yesterday  absurdly stiled  of Cruelty  for the Subject is entirely on Virtue  I think this Essay by much the best of all his Works  and well worth frequent Reading  I don t know whether any Thing  he has said  is the Occasion of this Observation occurring to me  but I have often thought  that the Writers both upon Religion  and Morality  have said enough about Virtue and Vice  yet have not sufficiently distinguished between Vice and Vice  which would be a more useful Criticism  as less obvious  I am realy afraid that some of the Works of our learned Divines have hardened more People thro  Despair  than ever they reclaimed by Repentance  proceeding too much upon a literal Construction of that Text    He who is guilty of the Breach of any Part of the Law  is guilty of the Whole   Which is a Doctrine as severe against God  as against Man —For  then  who was born to be saved  My Opinion is  that  as there is no Vice  which the Frailty of human Nature may not be led into  so there is no Crime  which the Divine Nature will not pardon  and the most irreligious Crime is the Despairing of that Pardon  The Christian Religion goes Hand in Hand with the Weakness of human Nature  and the very Doctrine of Repentance  without which no Man can be perfect  supposes us to have erred  Christ was a Pattern given us to imitate  not to equal    286 However  when our Saviour wishes the bitter Cup to pass by him  and makes that frail Ejaculation  Eli  Eli  lama sabacthani  he seems to suffer with more Weakness  than many Mortals have betrayed in Death or Torments  But surely this was to abate the Vain glory of Stoicism  to humble the Pride of Self sufficiency  and to shew us that God  who made us  as we are  indulges human Weaknesses even in the most perfect Man     Farewel  my charming Sinner  and I wish I had half your Virtues to attone for even all my Frailties   Your s  No Saint   LETTER CXLVI   Dear HARRY   I HAVE observed  since you left Town  that the Letters  which have passed between us  have not had the least Air of a Correspondence  Your s  indeed  are infinitely superior to any Thing I have ever seen under that Denomination  being regular finished Essays  while mine have been mere Acknowledgments for the Receipt of such a Treasure  And  if  at any Time  I have chanced to vary from the usual Form  and given Expression to my own Thoughts  which are only filled with Tenderness for you  you have not deigned to take the least Notice of them  To illustrate this Truth    287 can any Thing be more extraordinary  than your addressing your Answer  to the most important Concern of my Life  to Kitty  yet write to me by the same Post  without ever mentioning it  However  the Means cannot rob me of the Pleasure  I take  in knowing you are well   Whatever Effect Spleen may have on my Mind  I do assure you my Body  without that  is much disordered  But I hope every Thing from clear Air  Regularity  and Content  none of which I have the least Expectation of enjoying in London  tho  I believe I shall not go above five or six Miles from it  in Pursuit of them all  My Scheme  with Regard to Hertfordshire  is quite changed  — but more of this  when we meet  You flatter me with the Hopes of seeing you—Do you really think of coming  Tell me  and when   Mr  and Mrs  — have left Town  Mr  — goes to Ireland next Monday  I am just going to bid him Adieu  Indeed I shall be the most disconsolate of all Mortals  left among those  who serve only to debar me of the Pleasures of Solitude  and remind me of the Absence of them I love  I detest going abroad  yet must be obliged to it  for it will be impossible to bear Home without a Companion  or the Liberty of Reading  Which last
