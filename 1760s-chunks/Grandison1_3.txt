 much pleasure in town  and a return with a safe and sound heart  My sister  who  poor dear girl  continues extremely weak and low  will spare me for a purpose so indispensable  I will not have you come to us  I know it would grieve you to see her in the way she is in  You too much take to heart the infirmities of your friends which you cannot cure  and as your grandmamma lives upon your smiles  and you rejoice all your friends by your chearfulness  it would be cruel to make you sad   MR  GREVILLE has just left us  He dropt in upon us as we were going to dinner  My grandmother Selby you know is always pleased with his rattling  She prevailed on him to alight  and sit down with us  All his talk was of you  He repeated his   3 former threatenings  as I called them to him  on your going to town  After dinner  he read us a Letter from Lady Frampton relating to you  He read us also some passages from the copy of his answer  with design  I believe  that I should ask him to leave it behind him  He is a vain creature  you know  and seemed fond of what he had written  I did ask him  He pretended to make a scruple of your seeing it  but it was a faint one  However he called for pen and ink  and when it was brought him  scratched over two passages  and that with so many little flourishes  as you will see  that he thought they could not be read  But the ink I furnished him with happening to be paler than his  you will find he was not cunning enough  I promised to return it   Send me a line by the bearer  to tell me if your resolution holds as to the day   Adieu  my dearest Harriet  May angels protect and guide you whithersoever you go   LUCY SELBY   LETTER II  Mr  GREVILLE  To Lady FRAMPTON  Inclosed in the preceding   Northampton January 6   YOUR Ladyship demands a description of the Person of the celebrated Miss Byron in our neighbourhood  and to know  whether  as report tells you  Love has listed me in the number of her particular admirers —Particular admirers you well distinguish  since every one who beholds her admires her   Your Ladyship confines your enquiries to her Person  you tell me  and you own  that women are much more solicitous about the beauties of that  than of the Mind  Perhaps it may be so  and that their envy is much sooner excited by the one than by the others   4 But who  madam  can describe the person of Miss Harriet Byron  and her person only  animated as every feature is by a mind that bespeaks all human excellence  and dignifies her in every Air  in every Look  in every Motion   No man living has a greater passion for beauty than I have  Till I knew Miss Byron  I was one of those who regarded nothing else in the Sex  Indeed  I considered all intellectual attainments as either useless or impertinent in women  Your Ladyship knows what were my free notions on this head  and has rebuked me for them  A wise and learned Lady  I considered as a very unnatural character  I wanted women to be all Love  and nothing else  A very little Prudence allow d I to enter into their composition  just enough to distinguish the Man of Sense from the Fool  and that for my own sake  You know I have vanity  madam  But lovely as Miss Byron s person is  I defy the greatest Sensualist on earth not to admire her mind more than her person  What a triumph would the devil have  as I have often thought  when I have stood contemplating her perfections  especially at church  were he able to raise up a man that could lower this Angel into Woman —Pardon me —Your Ladyship knows my mad way of saying every thing that rises to my thoughts   Sweetness of temper must make plain featuresglow  What an effect must it then have upon fine ones  Never was there a sweeter temper d woman  Indeed from Sixteen to Twenty  all the Sex  kept in humour by their hopes  and by their attractions  are said to be good temper d  but she is remarkably so  She is just turned of Twenty  but looks not more than Seventeen  Her beauty  hardly yet in its full blow  will last longer  I imagine  than in an earlier blossom  Yet the prudence visible in her whole aspect  gave her a distinction  even at Twelve  that promised  what she would be at a riper age     5 Yet with all this reigning good nature visible in her face and manner  there is such a native dignity in all she says  in all she does  tho  mingled with a frankness that shews her mind s superiority to the minds of almost all other women  that it damps and suppresses  in the most audacious  all imaginations of bold familiarity   I know not  by my soul  how she does this neither
