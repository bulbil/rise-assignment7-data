defined an author as  un homme qui prend aux livres tout ce qui lui passe par la tête   The public rightly judges the work of art by the criterion of pleasure which it is capable of giving  By that standard Gil Blas was long ago classed among the delightful books of the world  How many of its beauties are plagiarisms  or whether any of them are  are inquiries which the wise are content to leave to the mandarins of literature   While the oft reported story of the pillage by Lesage of a lost Spanish manuscript is a myth  it is incontestable that in the last books of Gil Blas he embodied long passages from a French translation of two Italian pamphlets on The Disgrace of Count Olivares  and from a book published in 1683 at Cologne entitled  Le Ministre Parfait ou le Comte Duc  It is easy to prove also that Lesage had read Lazarilla de Tormes and a great many Spanish tales and plays  but  as M  Lintilhac says  so had Corneille  yet the Cid remains the Cid      II  The representation of life  then  is the avowed object of Lesage  Gil Blas is a microcosm  One might apply to Lesage the words of Balzac in allusion to the Comedie Humaine    J aurai porté une société toute entière dans ma tête   Gil Blas is a picture  singularly vivid and comprehensive  of the society of France at the close of the reign of Louis XIV and at the beginning of the Regency  Lesage  like St  Simon  sought to reflect the life of his time  but he is greater than St  Simon because of the larger general interest and significance of his literary form  Lesage was a gentleman  serenely  gaily taking notes on the world that surrounded him  but  as it pleased him to publish all his notes in his own lifetime  he adopted the novel form and the device of a Spanish atmosphere  Happily the society that surrounded Lesage in the Paris of the end of the seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth centuries was sufficiently complex and representative for an exhaustive picture of that world to assume a typical value   Gil Blas is an encyclopadia of human types  No other single book contains so rich a collection of specimens of the genus homo  The success with which Lesage has introduced into Gil Blas virtually every form of human character  all sorts and conditions of men  is one of the miracles of literary art  The purely traditional picaro types  the vagabond and the beggar  the unscrupulous highwayman and the cut throat  have  after all  comparatively small importance in the great comedy of life which Lesage depicts  These picaro types move in and out of the vast throng peopling his pages much as their counterparts in the flesh  the Apaches of the Marais quarter  jostled on the Pont Neuf the honest workman  the country bumpkin  the banker Turcaret  the bourgeois merchant  the strutting soldier  the barefoot monk  the daintily stepping petits maîtres  the authors and the actors  the ministers and the high officials  the servants and the adventurers  the priests  and the précieuses peering from their vinaigrettes  From the brigand cave that sheltered the jail bird to the drawing room of the Marquise de Chaves  from the boudoir of the enticing Laure to the cabinet of the Duke of Olivares  we visit every haunt of human activity and every social condition  conversing on the way with comedians  doctors  poets  lawyers  statesmen  valets  judges of the Inquisition  shopkeepers  courtesans  archbishops  and countless other actors of the Human Comedy  The final impression is that we have been in contact with the whole of life and with life as a whole  In this connexion it is pertinent to quote the verdict of Nodier in the  Notice  prefixed to the famous and now rare edition of Gil Blas containing the woodcuts of Jean Gigoux  Paris 1835     Comme il avait embrassé tout ce qui appartient à l homme dans sa composition  il osa se prescrire d embrasser toute la langue dans son travail   In other words  the grammarian and the lexicographer have in Gil Blas what Nodier is justified in calling  un monument de la langue    We have witnessed the amusing spectacle arm in arm with Gil Blas de Santillane  a puppet of circumstance  but the most good  natured of companions  No youth of sprightlier wit  of keener observation  or of more unfailing good humour was ever born of mortal man or immortal writer  Gil Blas is too agreeable a fellow for us to dream of parting company with him merely because of his escapades  Moreover  no one was ever long in his company without discovering that the firstfruit of his innate gift of observation is a habit of reflection gradually conducting him to the point of view of the great American pragmatist  For Gil Blas  as for Franklin  whatever else honesty may be  it is at all events the best policy  His ambition  to get on   to succeed  is not the ambition of a Julien Sorel  He is not ready and willing to succeed at any price  He would not say cynically with Marie  Caroline of Naples   je vois trop que la force seule compte et que
