interim  to retire to   his own country to set the affairs of his disconsolate family in order    This the tyrant intended most peremptorily to refuse  by granting   it  as he conceived  on the impossible condition of his procuring   some one to remain as hostage for his return  under equal forfeiture   of life  Pythias heard the condition  and did not wait for an ap    plication on the part of Damon  he instantly offered himself to   durance in place of his friend  and Damon was accordingly set   at liberty      The king and all his courtiers were astonished at this action    as they could not account for it on any allowed principles  Self    interest  in their judgment  was the sole mover of human affairs     and they looked on virtue  friendship  benevolence  love of country    and the like  as terms invented by the wise to impose upon the   weak  They  therefore  imputed this act of Pythias to the ex          32 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      travagance of his folly  to the defect of head merely  and no way   to any virtue or good quality of heart      When the day of the destined execution drew near  the tyrant   had the curiosity to visit Pythias in his dungeon  Having re    proached him for the romantic stupidity of his conduct  and rallied   him for some time on his madness in presuming that Damon  by   his return  would prove as great a fool as himself My lord  said   Pythias  with a firm voice and noble aspect  I would it were possible   that I might suffer a thousand deaths rather than my friend should   fail in any article of his honour  He cannot fail therein  my lord    I am as confident of his virtue as I am of my own existence  But   I pray  I beseech the gods  to preserve the life and integrity of   my Damon together  Oppose him  ye winds prevent the eager    ness and impatience of his honourable endeavours and suffer him   not to arrive till  by my death  I have redeemed a life a thousand   times of more consequence  more estimation  than my own   more   estimable to his lovely wife  to his precious little innocents  to his   friends  to his country   leave me not to die the worst of deaths   in my Damon       Dionysius was confounded and awed by the dignity of these   sentiments  and by the manner  still more sentimental  in which   they were uttered  He felt his heart struck by a slight sense of   invading truth   but it served rather to perplex than to undeceive   him  He hesitated he would have spoken   but he looked down   and retired in silence      The fatal day arrived  Pythias was brought forth  and walked   amidst the guard  with a serious but satisfied air  to the place of   execution      Dionysius was already there  He was exalted on a moving throne   that was drawn by six white horses  and sat pensive and attentive   to the demeanour of the prisoner      Pythias came  He vaulted lightly on the scaffold  and be    holding  for some time  the apparatus of his death  he turned   with a pleased countenance and addressed the assembly      My prayers are heard  he cried   the gods are propitious   You   know  my friends  that the winds have been contrary till yesterday    Damon could not come he could not conquer impossibilities  he   will be here to morrow  and the blood which is shed to day shall   have ransomed the life of my friend  O   could I erase from your   bosoms every doubt  every mean suspicion of the honour of the   man for whom I am about to suffer  I should go to my death even   as I would to my bridal   Be it sufficient  in the mean time  that   my friend will be found noble   that his truth is unimpeachable     that he will speedily approve it   that he is now on his way  hurry    ing on  accusing himself  the adverse elements  and the gods  But   I haste to prevent his speed   executioner  to your office       As he pronounced the last words  a buzz began to arise among   the remotest of the people  A distant voice was heard  The   crowd caught the words   and Stop  stop the execution   was re    peated by the whole assembly      A man came at full speed
