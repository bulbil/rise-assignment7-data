 layable  is become a greater grievance than all that it was intended   to redress          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  151     I lately asked a pleasant gentleman of the coif if he thought it   possible for a poor man to obtain a decree  in matter of property    against a rich man  He smiled  and answered according to scripture    that   with man it was impossible  but that all things were possible   to God   I suppose he meant that the decrees of the courts of   Westminster were hereafter to be reversed      Perhaps  sir  said Mr  Fielding  neither our laws nor our lawyers   are so much to blame  as the people who apply to them for pro    tection  for justice  satisfaction  or revenge  Might not the parties    who adventure on the course of litigation  begin where they are   most likely to end their career  in the award of a few persons  or a   verdict of twelve neighbours       But the nature of man is prone to contention and quarrel  There   is a certain portion of yeast or fermentation in his mass  that will   have vent in some way   and our courts of law are the most obvious   receptacles for the ebullitions of pride  avarice  envy  resentment    and wrathfulness  the insolence of temper  and overflowings of   fortune      Mr  Scruple  an attorney  a very singular man in his way  was   lately recommended to me as a person equally qualified for allur    ing or compelling my litigating opponents to an accommodation     and he told me an exceeding pleasant story  as well respecting   the process and forms of our courts of law  as respecting the con    tentious disposition of our neighbours      Some time since   Walter Warmhouse  a substantial farmer in   Essex  was advised by Sergeant Craw  that he had an unques    tionable right to a certain tenement in the possession of Barnaby   Boniface  his next neighbour and gossip  who fattened by the dint   of good ale and good humour      Barnaby  who equally hated debate and dry bowels  offered to   leave the matter in question to any honest neighbours of Walter s   own choosing  but Walter  proud of a weighty opinion and as   weighty a purse  rejected the proffered compromise with scorn    and took a mortal aversion to honest Barnaby  because he refused   to surrender his possessions on demand      Walter Warmhouse accordingly began the attack in form   but   Mr  Scruple  who had the uncommon conscience to remember that   Barnaby had once recovered his purse from a highwayman  de    termined as far as possible to preserve the property of his old   friend  For this purpose he kept warily and cheaply on the de    fensive  and  while he held a watchful eye over the motions of   the adversary  he followed him close through a thirteen years    labyrinth of law forms  and  what with exceptions to bills and   replies  expensive commissions for examination of witnesses  de    murrer  imparlance  and essoign  with hearings and re hearings    defer of issue thereon  costs of suit and costs of office  he pretty   nearly exhausted both the purse and the patience of the valorous   plaintiff  Walter Warmhouse  Whereupon his prudent patron    the good Sergeant Craw  deemed it high time to consent to a   motion for referring the case to the arbitration and award of   certain umpires  though not of his client s choosing  as at first   proposed          152 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      Soon after this order  Sergeant Craw had occasion to travel to   the farther parts of Essex  and his road led to the concerns of   his old client  Walter Warmhouse  Here Walter happened to   meet him  and warned him of the manifold dangers of the way    and of the numbers of thieves and highwaymen that infested the   passages that lay just before him  And pray  then  very smoothly   says the sergeant  is there no way through your fields  Mr  Warm    house  There is  sir  said Warmhouse  as good as any in Eng    land  And may I not be permitted to pass   Most safely  and a   thousand welcomes      Hereupon client Warmhouse opened the gate that led from the   road into the fields  and in issued the equipage of his learned   advocate and kind patron      Goodman Warmhouse was mounted on a round  ambling nag    and rode much at his ease
