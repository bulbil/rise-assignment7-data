  who had appointed to pay me a large sum of money  On my   return in the evening through Moorfields  attended only by my   favourite Irishman  a very faithful and active fellow  though it was   yet fair day  I was suddenly set upon by a posse of robbers  who   rushed on me from behind a cover  The first of them  running up    fired directly in my face  but did me no further damage than by   carrying away a small piece of the upper part of my left ear  Had   the fools demanded my money  I would have given it to them at a   word  but  finding them bent on murder  I resolved that they   should have my life at as dear a rate as possible  I instantly drew   my sword  and run the first through the body   and then  rushing   on the second assailant  I laid him also on the ground before he   had time to take his aim  so that his pistol went harmlessly off   in his fall      In the mean while my brave and loving companion was not idle     with two strokes of his oaken cudgel he had levelled two more of   them with the earth  Hereupon the remainder halted  retreated   into a group  and then stood and fired upon us altogether   but  ob    serving that we did not drop  they cast their arms to the ground    and run ofl several ways as fast as they could  My good friend    Tirlah O Donnoh  then turned affectionately to me Are you hurt    my dear master  says he  I believe I am  Tirlah  let us make   home the best we can  O  cried the noble creature  if nobody was   hurt but Tirlah  Tirlah wouldn t be hurt at all       Here  taking me under the arm  we walked slowly to the city    till  coming to a hackney coach  he put me tenderly into it   and    sitting beside me  supported me  as I began to grow weak through   much effusion of blood      As soon as we got home  the coachman  as is their practice    thundered at the door   and my Matty  according to custom   whenever I was abroad  was the readiest of all our domestics to   open      By this time I had fainted  and was quite insensible   but when   my tender and true mate saw me borne by two men into her pre    sence  all pale and bloody  she  who thought she had fortitude to   support the wreck of the world  gave a shriek that w r as enough to   alarm the neighbourhood  and  instantly falling backward  got a   violent contusion in the hinder part of her head      Immediately we were conveyed to separate beds  and all requisite   help was provided  It was found that I had received six or seven   flesh wounds  but none of them proved dangerous  as they were   given at a distance  and by pistol shot  But  alas   my Matty s case   was very different  she fell into sudden and premature labour    and having suffered extreme anguish all the night  during which   she ceased not to inquire after me  she was with difficulty delivered   of a male infant  who was suffocated in the birth      In the mean while  the good and tender hearted old gentleman   hurried about incessantly from one of us to the other  wringing his   hands  and scarcely retaining his senses          202 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      As soon as my wounds were dressed  and I had recovered my   memory  I looked about and hastily inquired for my wife   but they   cautiously answered me that she was something indisposed with the   fright which she got at seeing me bloody  and that her father had   insisted on her going to bed      On the second dressing of my wounds I was pronounced out of   danger  and then they ventured to tell me of my Matty s miscar    riage  and of the bruise which she had got in her fall when she   fainted  On hearing this my heart was cleft  as it were  in twain    I accused myself of the murder of my wife and infant  and I   accused all  without exception  of their indiscretion in not con    cealing my disaster from her      At times I began to fear that my wife was either dead  or much   worse than they represented  On my third dressing  therefore  I   peremptorily insisted on my being carried into her chamber
