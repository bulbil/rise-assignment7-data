On hearing who it was that asked for him  he was a little surprized  and   desired he would walk up stairs  but Mr  Staple not knowing but there   might be company above  returned for answer  that he had no more than a   word or two to say to him  and that must be in private  on which the   other immediately came down to him       This young lover having by accident been informed  not only that Mr    Trueworth made his addresses to Miss Betsy  but also that it was with   him she had been engaged during all that time he had been deprived of   seeing her  thought it proper to talk with Mr  Goodman concerning this   new obstacle to his wishes  That worthy gentleman was extremely troubled   to be questioned on an affair  on which he had given Miss Betsy his word   not to interfere  but finding himself very much pressed by a person   whose passion he had encouraged  and who was the son of one with whom he   had lived in a long friendship  he frankly confessed to him that Mr    Trueworth was indeed recommended to Miss Betsy by her brother  told him   he was sorry the thing had happened so  but had nothing farther to do   with it  that the young lady was at her own disposal  as to the article   of marriage  that he was ignorant how she would determine  and that it   must be from herself alone he could learn what it was he might expect   or hope       Mr  Staple received little satisfaction from what Mr  Goodman had said    but resolved to take his advice  and  if possible  bring Miss Betsy to   some eclaircissement of the fate he was to hope or fear  Accordingly  he   came the next morning to visit her  a liberty he had never taken  nor   would now  if he had not despaired of finding her in the afternoon       She gave herself  however  no airs of resentment on that account  but   when he began to testify his discontent concerning Mr  Trueworth  and   the apprehensions he had of his having gained the preference in her   heart  though the last who had solicited that happiness  she replied  in   the most haughty tones  that she was surprized at the freedom he took   with her  that she was  and ever would be  mistress of her actions and   sentiments  and no man had a right to pry into either  and concluded   with saying  that she was sorry the civilities she had treated him with    should make him imagine he had a privilege of finding fault with those   she shewed to others       It is not to be doubted but that he made use of all the arguments in his   power to convince her  that a true and perfect passion was never   unaccompanied with jealous fears  He acknowledged the merits of Mr    Trueworth   But   added he   the more he is possessed of  the more   dangerous he is to my hopes   And then begged her to consider the   torments he had suffered  while being so long deprived of her presence    and knowing  at the same time  a rival was blessed with it       Miss Betsy was not at this time in a humour either to be persuaded by   the reasons  or softened by the submissions  of her lover  and poor Mr    Staple  after having urged all that love  wit  despair  and grief  could   dictate  was obliged to depart more dissatisfied than he came       In going out he saw Mr  Goodman in the parlour  who gave him the  Good   morning   as he passed   A sad one it has been to me   answered he  with   somewhat of horror in his countenance   but I will not endure the rack   of many such   With these words he flung out of the house  in order to   go about what  perhaps  the reader is not at a loss to guess at                CHAPTER XXII       A duel begun  and another fought in the same morning  on Miss Betsy s   account  are here related  with the manner in which the different   antagonists behaved to each other          Well may the God of Love be painted blind  Those devoted to his   influence are seldom capable of seeing things as they truly are  the   smallest favour elates them with imaginary hopes  and the least coolness   sinks then into despair  their joys  their griefs  their fears  more   frequently spring from ideal rather than effective
