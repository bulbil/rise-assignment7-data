MISTAKE BRINGS AN IMPBOPER VISITOE   INTO TOO GENTEEL COMPANY     Immediately below him  you see one of those instances of incon    sistency which diversify the motley character of man  In the deep   sunk lines of his face you may read learning and intense thought    as the placid serenity of his eye shows a heart warmed with piety   and moral virtue   what pity that a listless indolence of mind   throws a shade over so bright a character  and submission to the   capricious yoke of female tyranny make him passively guilty of the   very follies and vices most immediately opposite to his own virtue   and good sense       The pious care of a good father had so improved the eminent   Abilities with which nature had blessed this gentleman  by the most         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 111     judicious education  that the promise of his youth gave hopes of   his being an ornament and advantage to his age and country   but   one indiscreet action overcast this pleasing prospect   and in its   consequences has brought him to be the insignificant thing you see      This was a marriage of mere inclination  with a person who had   neither fortune  beauty  nor merit  to justify his choice   and who   yet has taken the unjustifiable advantage of this indolence of his   temper to usurp as absolute an authority over him as if she pos    sessed them all in the most eminent degree  and conferred upon him   the benefit and obligation she herself received      This makes his life one scene of the most irreconcilable incon    sistenoy  between the wisdom and virtue of the very few actions in   which he is admitted to follow the dictates of his own judgment    and the follies and vices into which she wantonly leads him every   moment of his life  When I say vices  I mean those of dissipation    luxury  and extravagance  which  though the most injurious to   society  and productive of the worst consequences to particulars    are yet too often looked upon in another light  and thought harm    less  at least  if not even commendable exertions of greatness and   generosity of spirit  and the proper use of afiSuenoe of fortune   for    not content with the rational enjoyment of the fortune to which   he raised her  in her proper sphere  she has assumed the absolute   disposal of the whole  which she dissipates in every kind of fashion    able folly and profusion  so as utterly to disable him from exerting   the natural generosity and benevolence of his heart in the extent   and manner suited to his apparent wealth  and too often from   discharging the moral obligations of honesty  in the payment of his   just and necessary debts      Such an ungrateful abuse of obligation and influence may appear   strange to you  who have been so little conversant in the ways of   man   but  to a more extended view of life  constant observation   shows that conferring a great benefit actually extinguishes gratitude    instead of raising it higher  and that the meaner the hands into which   power is entrusted  the more exorbitant and tyrannical the use they   make of it  Whether this arises from a consciousness of inabiUty   to pay so great a debt  and a consequent desire to cancel it by an   absolute breach  that may  at the same time  also support the   debtor s pride  and seem to hide the obligation  by an implied   disavowal in the former case  and from a desire of returning the   tyranny felt before in the latter  would be a curious and not unprofit    able disquisition  but shall be reserved to another place  where the   occasion wiU illustrate it more forcibly   and only the justice of the   observation  as to the present case in particular  proved by a few    out of innumerable instances of the same kind      Of all the methods of dissipating wealth  and precipitating ruin    the most speedy and effectual is gaming  The present prevalence   of the passion for this vice  for to call it by any other name would   be a false tenderness  among all ranks and sexes has been already   often observed  as it is the characteristic of the times  However    to soften the horror  with which the barefaced practice of it  by   the fairer sex must strike every rational mind  it is blended with   matters of mere amusement  and represented only as an innocent         112 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     method of relieving conversation when a number of persons meet   in public company  which must otherwise languish and grow tire    some
