leaving me alone  and giving me to understand that what he had communicated to Mr  Medlar at the bar was an affair of the last importance    97 that would admit of no delay —He then called for some coffee  and launched out into the virtues of that berry  which  he said  in cold phlegmatic constitutions  like his  dried up the superfluous moisture  and braced the relaxed nerves —He let me know  that it was utterly unknown to the ancients  and derived its name from an Arabian word  which I might easily perceive by the sound and termination —From this topick he transferred his disquisitions to the verb drink  which he affirmed  was improperly applied to the taking of coffee  in as much as people did not drink  but sip or sipple that liquor —that the genuine meaning of drinking is to quench one s thirst  or commit a debauch by swallowing wine —that the Latin word  which conveyed the same idea  was bibere or potare  and that of the Greeks pinein or poteein  though he was apt to believe they were differently used on different occasions  For example  to drink a vast quantity  or  as the vulgar express it  to drink an ocean of liquor  was in Latin potare  and in Greek poteein  and on the other hand  to use it moderately  was bibere and pinein —that this was only a conjecture of his own  which  however  seemed to be supported by the word bibulous  which is particularly applied to the pores of the skin  that can only drink a very small quantity of the circumambient moisture  by reason of the smallness of their diameters —whereas  from the verb poteein  is derived the substantive potamos  which signifies a river  or vast quantity of liquor —I could not help smiling at this learned and important investigation  and to recommend myself the more to my new acquaintance  whose disposition I was by this time   98 well informed of  I observed  that what he alledged  did not  to the best of my remembrance  appear in the writings of the ancients  for  Horace uses the words poto and bibo indifferently for the same purpose  as in the twentieth Ode of his first Book   Vile potabis modicis sabinum cantharis —  —Et proelo domitam caleno tu bibes uvam   That I had never heard of the verb poteein  but that potamos  potema  and potos  were derived from pino  poso  pepoka  in consequence of which  the Greek poets never use any other word for festal drinking —Homer describes Nestor at his cups in these words   Nestora d  ouk elathen jache pinonta perempes    And Anacreon mentions it on the same occasion almost in every    Pionti d  oinon hedun   Otan pino ton oinon    Opliz  ego de pino   And in a thousand other places —The doctor  who  doubtless  intended by his criticism  to give me an high idea of his erudition  was infinitely surprized to find himself schooled by one in my appearance  and after a considerable pause  cried    Upon my word  you are in the right  Sir —I find I have not considered this affair with my usual accuracy —  Then accosting me  in Latin  which he spoke very well  the conversation was maintained full two hours  on a variety of subjects  in that language  and indeed  he spoke so judiciously  that I was convinced  notwithstanding his whimsical appearance  and attention   99 to trifles  of his being a man of extensive knowledge  especially in books  he looked upon upon me  as I afterwards understood from Mr  Medlar  as a prodigy in learning  and proposed that very night  if I was not engaged  to introduce me to several young gentlemen of fortune and fashion  with whom he had an appointment at the Bedford coffee house     CHAP  XLVI    Wagtail introduces me to a set of fine gentlemen  with whom I spend the evening at a tavern—our conversation—the characters of my new companions—the doctor is roasted—the issue of our debauch   I Accepted his offer with pleasure  and we went thither in a hackney coach  where I saw a great number of gay figures fluttering about  most of whom spoke to the doctor with great familiarity  Among the rest  stood a groupe of them around the fire  whom I immediately knew to be the very persons who had the night before  by their laughing  alarmed my suspicion of the lady who had put herself under my protection —They no sooner perceived me enter with Dr  Wagtail  for that was my companion s name  than they tittered and whispered one to another  and I was not a little surprized to find that they were the gentlemen to whose acquaintance he designed to recommend me  for when he observed them together    100 he told me who they were  and desired to know by what name he should introduce me  I satisfied him in that particular  and he advanced with great gravity  saying     Gentlemen  your most obedient—give me leave to introduce my friend Mr  Random  to your society    Then turning to me    Mr  Random
