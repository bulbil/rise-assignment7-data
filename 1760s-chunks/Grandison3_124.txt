when I bid you—She read—   Let me beseech you  Sir  I was very earnest  you see  to hate  to despise  to detest  Now don t look this way  the unhappy Clementina  with all my heart  but  for the sake of your immortal Soul  let me conjure you to be reconciled to our Holy Mother Church —   Will you  Sir —following my indeed averted face with her sweet face  for I could not look towards her  Say you will  I heard you once called an Angel of a man  And is it not better to be an Angel in Heaven —Tender hearted man  I always thought you had sensibility—Say you will—Not for my sake—I told you  that I would content myself to be still despised  It shall not be said  that you did this for a wife —No  Sir  your conscience shall have all the merit of it —And I ll tell you what  I will lay me down in peace—She stood up with a dignity that was augmented by her   309 piety  And I will say    Now do  thou  O beckoning Angel  for an Angel will be on the other side of the river—The river shall be death  Sir —Now do thou  reach out thy Divine hand  O Minister of Peace  I will wade through these separating waters  and I will bespeak a place for the man  who  many  many years hence  may fill it —And I will sit next you for ever and ever    —And this  Sir  shall satisfy the poor Clementina  who will then be richer than the richest  So you see  Sir  as I told my mother  I was setting out on God s errand  not on my own     For hours might the dear Lady have talked on  without interruption from me —My dear Dr  Bartlett  What did I not suffer   The Marchioness was too near for herself  She could not bear this speech of her pious  generous  noble daughter  She sobbed  she groaned   Clementina started—She looked at me  She looked round her  Whence came these groans  Did you groan  Sir —You are not a hard hearted man  tho  they say you are  But will you be a Catholic  Sir  Say you will  I won t be denied  And I will tell you what—If I don t resign to my destiny in a few  a very few weeks  why then I will go into a nunnery  and then I shall be God s child  you know  even in this life   What could I say to the dear Lady  Her mind was raised above an earthly Love  Circumstanced as we were  how could I express the tenderness for her which overflowed my heart  Compassion is a motive that a woman of spirit will reject  And how could Love be here pleaded  when the parties believed it to be in my own power to exert it  Could I endeavour to replace myself in her affection  when I refused to comply with their terms  and they with mine  To have argued against her religion  and in defence of my own  her mind so disturbed  could not be done  And ought I  in generosity  in justice to   310 her family  to have attempted to unsettle her in a faith in which she  and all her family  were so well satisfied   I could only  when I could speak  applaud her piety  and pronounce her an Angel of a woman  an ornament of her sex  and an honour to her religion  and endeavour to wave the subject   Ah  Chevalier  said she  after a silence of some minutes —You are an obstinate man  Indeed you are—Yet  I think  you do not despise me —But what says your paper   She took it out of her bosom  and read it  She seemed affected by it  as if she had not before considered it  And you really proposed these terms  Sir  And would you have allowed me the full exercise of my religion  And should I have had my confessor  And would you have allowed me to convert you  if I could  And would you have treated my confessor kindly  And would you have been dutiful to my papa and mamma  And would you have loved my two other brothers as well as you do Jeronymo —And would you have let me live at Bologna  You don t say  Yes —But do you say  No   To these terms  madam  most willingly would I have subscribed  And if  my dearest Lady  they could have had the wished for effect  how happy had I been   Well —She then paused  and resuming  What shall we say to all these things   I thought her mother would take it well  to have an opportunity given her to quit the closet  now her Clementina had changed her subject to one so concerning to the whole family  I favoured her doing so  She slipt out  her face bathed in tears  and soon after came in at the drawing room door   Ah  madam  said Clementina  paying obeisance
