as having  by her scorn    triumphed over his audacity  and drove him from the field of battle  He   therefore resolved to continue his visits for some time  and to pique   her  as he imagined  directed all the fine things his common place book   was well stored with  to Miss Flora  leaving the other wholly neglected       But here he was little less deceived than he had been before in the   sentiments of that young lady  the hatred his late behaviour had given   her  and the utter detestation it had excited in her towards him  had   for a time extinguished that vanity so almost inseparable from youth    especially when accompanied with beauty  and she rather rejoiced  than   the contrary  to see him affect to be so much taken up with Miss Flora    that he could scarce say the least complaisant thing to her  as it freed   her from the necessity of returning it in some measure  Her good sense   had now scope to operate  she saw  as in a mirror  her own late follies   in those of Miss Flora  who swelled with all the pride of flattered   vanity on this new imaginary conquest over the heart of the accomplished   Gayland  as he was generally esteemed  and perceived the errors of such   a way of thinking and acting in so clear a light  as  had it continued    would doubtless have spared her those anxieties her relapse from it   afterwards occasioned       In these serious reflections let us leave her for a time  to see in what   situation Mr  Saving was  after being denied access to his mistress  As   it was impossible for a heart to be more truly sincere and affectionate    he was far from being able to make any efforts for the banishing Miss   Betsy s image thence  on the contrary  he thought of nothing but how to   continue a correspondence with her  and endeavour  by all the means in   his power  to engage her to a private interview  As his flame was pure   and respectful  he was some days debating within himself how to proceed    so as not to let her think he had desisted from his pretensions  or to   continue them in a manner at which she should not be offended  Love    when real  seldom fails of inspiring the breast that harbours it with an   equal share of timidity  he trembled whenever he thought of soliciting   such a meeting  yet  without it  how could he hope to retain any place   in her memory  much less make any progress in gaining her affection  At   length  however  he assumed enough courage to write to her  and by a   bribe to one of the servants  got his letter delivered to her  fearing   if he had it sent by the post  or any publick way to the house  it would   be intercepted by the caution he found Mr  Goodman had resolved to   observe in this point       Miss Betsy knowing his hand by the superscription  was a little   surprized  as perhaps having never thought of him since they parted  but   opened it without the least emotion either of pain or pleasure  she knew   him too well to be under any apprehensions of being treated by him as   she had been by Gayland  and was too little sensible of his merit to   feel the least impatience for examining the dictates of his affection    yet  indifferent as she was  she could not forbear being touched on   reading these lines              Most adored of your sex            I doubt not but you are acquainted with Mr  Goodman s behaviour to        me  but  oh  I fear you are too insensible of the agonies in which        my soul labours through his cruel caution  Dreadful is the loss of        sight  yet what is sight to me  when it presents not you  Though I        saw you regardless of my ardent passion  yet still I saw you  and        while I did so  could not be wholly wretched  What have I not        endured since deprived of that only joy for which I wish to live         Had it not been improper for me to have been seen near Mr         Goodman s house  after having been forbid entrance to it  I should        have dwelt for ever in your street  in hope of sometimes getting a        glimpse of you from one or other of the windows  this
