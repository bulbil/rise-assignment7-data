should determine you  It did  pardon me  madam  in your journey hither   She reddened to her very ears  Your brother  Ladies  has the reputation of being a polite man  Bear witness to this instance of it  I am ashamed of myself   If I am unpolite  madam  my sincerity will be my excuse  at least to my own heart   O that inflexible heart  But  Ladies  if the inhospitable Englishman refuse his protection in his own   160 country  to a foreign woman  of no mean quality  Do not you  his sisters  despise her   They  madam  and their Lords  will render you every chearful service  Let me request you  my sisters  to make England as agreeable as possible to this Lady  She is of the first consideration in her own country  She will be of such where ever she goes  My Lady Maffei deserves likewise your utmost respect  Then addressing himself to them  Ladies  said he  encourage my sisters  They will think themselves honoured by your commands   The two sisters confirmed  in an obliging manner  what their brother had said  and both Ladies acknowleged themselves indebted to them for their offered friendship  But Lady Olivia seemed not at all satisfied with her brother  And it was with some difficulty he prevailed on her to return to the company  and drink coffee   I could not help reflecting  on occasion of this Lady s conduct  that fathers and mothers are great blessings  to daughters  in particular  even when women grown  It is not every woman that will shine in a state of independency  Great fortunes are snares  If independent women escape the machinations of men  which they have often a difficulty to do  they will frequently be hurried by their own imaginations  which are said to be livelier than those of men  tho  their judgments are supposed less  into inconveniencies  Had Lady Olivia s parents or uncles lived  she hardly would have been permitted to make the tour of Europe  And not having so great a fortune to support vagaries  would have shone  as she is well qualified to do  in a dependent state  in Italy  and made some worthy man and herself haappy   Had she a mind great enough to induce her to pity Clementina  I should have been apt to pity her  for I saw her soul was disturbed  I saw that the man she loved was not able to return her Love  A pitiable   161 case  I saw a starting tear now and then with difficulty disperted  Once she rubbed her eye  and  being conscious of observation  said something had got into it  So it had  The something was a tear  Yet she looked with haughtiness  and her besom swelled with indignation ill concealed   Sir Charles repeated his recommendation of her to Lord L  and Lord G  They offered their best services  Lord W  invited her and all of us to Windsor  Different parties of pleasure were talked of  But still the Enlivener of every party was not to be in any one of them  She tried to look pleased  but did not always succeed in the trial  An eye of Love and Anger mingled was often cast upon the man whom every body loved  Her bosom heaved  as it seemed sometimes  with indignation against herself  That was the construction which I made of some of her looks   Lady Maffei  however  seemed pleased with the parties of pleasure talked of  She often directed herself to me in Italian  I answered her in it as well as I could  I do not talk it well  But as I am not an Italian  and little more than book learned in it  for it is a long time ago since I lost my grandpappa  who used to converse with me in it  and in French  I was not scrupulous to answer in it  To have forborne  because I did not excel in what I had no opportunity to excel in  would have been false modesty  nearly bordering upon pride  Were any Lady to laugh at me for not speaking well her native tongue  I would not return the smile  were she to be less perfect in mine  than I am in hers  But Lady Olivia made me a compliment on my faulty accent  when I acknowleged it to be so  Signora  said she  you shew us  that a pretty mouth can give beauty to a defect  A master teaching you  added she  would perhaps find some fault  but a friend conversing with you  must be in love with you for the very imperfection   Sir Charles was generously pleased with the compliment  and made her a fine one on her observation     162 He attended the two Ladies to their lodgings in his coach  He owned to Dr  Bartlett  that Lady Olivia was in tears all the way  lamenting her disgrace in coming to England  just as he was quitting it  and wishing she had stay d at Florence  She would have engaged him to correspond with her  He excused himself  It was a very afflicting thing to him  he told the doctor
