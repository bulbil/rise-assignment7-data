  for procuring the deliverance of Antonio  I have a protector   among the conquerors  the most generous of mankind  who will   not refuse his assistance on such an occasion        These words comforted Olivia with a hope  for the accomplish    ment of which though she was indebted to another cause  The way   from the convent to the house of Alphonso s father leading them by   the prison of the Inquisition  Olivia was so affected at the sight of it    that she swooned away in the arms of Alphonso  Such an accident   naturally threw the whole company into an embarrassment   while   they were in the midst of which  a body of English seamen  who   had slipped away from their officers  and were roving about merely   from curiosity  and without intention of doing mischief  but ready   to join in any that should fall in their way  happemng to come by    no sooner understood from the guard what was the matter  than   looking at each other for some moments  as if waiting for the word   of command  At length one of them cried out    Hullo  boys     What say you   Shall we bail the gentlewoman s father   Mayhap   there may be some of our countrymen in the bilboes along with   him  Danm my eyes and limbs  but it would be good fun to set them   all free  I fancy the Inquisitors will not refuse our bail   if they do    I should be glad to pick a quarrel with them   I hate them mortally   ever since I saw them roast some poor Smouches at Lisbon because   they would not eat pork  Come   cheer away  my hearts of oak     All hands aloft  and to work        These words were like fire given to a mine  He had scarce   finished  when the thoughtless creatures without more ado ran to   the prison  and  while some of them were forcing in the gates  the   rest  mounting on each other s shoulders  climbed over the   walls  The moment Olivia  now recovered from her swoon  saw   the prison open    Now is the time  Alphonso   said she    now is   the time to set my father free            320 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     The hint waa sufficient  Alphonso turned directly to the guard    and perceiving by their looks that they were willing to assist him      I go  my love     said he     but where shall I leave you in safety   till I return   Such a place cannot be fit for your delicacy          Speak not of leaving me     interrupted she eagerly    I will go   with you   No delicacy shall interfere with such a duty        On her saying this  they all entered the prison  where the seamen   were shouting and skipping about like so many wild creatures  and   setting all the prisoners at liberty wherever they went  The secrets   of this prison house are too horrid for description  I shall  therefore   draw a veil over them at this time  especially as another occasion   will lead me into the same scenes again  when the representation   will be more interesting      No words can convey an idea of the tenderness of the meeting   between Olivia and her father  whom Alphonso and she readily   found out  As soon as they had indulged the first transports of   their joy  she informed him briefly how much they were both in    debted to Alphonso for their present happiness  Though her   father was not at a loss for the motive of such generosity  he thought   it not proper to take notice of it at that time  He embraced him   tenderly  and besought Heaven to reward his virtues        The happiness of serving those most dear to us    said Alphonso    who had not the same command of his temper    is its own reward    Olivia and her father have a right to everything in my power  Let   us leave this place  the sight of which appals my soul  Let us   go to the house of my father          Lead on  my children    answered Olivia s father    I follow   willingly   and not without hope of reconciling my friend to our   general happiness       When they went out of the prison they found the sailors employed   in executing a piece of justice exactly in their character  They had
