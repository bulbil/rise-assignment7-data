ran into a neighbouring coffee house  where he told the company   that he had been just knocked down and robbed of a considerable   sum of money  which he was to pay the next day  Some of them   instantly went to the place in which he said this had happened    where they found his hat and wig  and the papers he had left for   them  which at first gained credit to the story  But when the   general tenor of his character  and the circumstances of his being    to pay that sum the nest day  came to be considered  the whole   artifice was seen through  especially as he never offered to prove   where he had received the money  nor gave any reason for his    carrying such a sum about him  the very bulk and weight of which    for he said it was all in specie to prevent too particular an inquiry   about bank notes  must have been a trouble and incumbrance to   him  but barely alleged that he had always kept the money by him   in cash  ever since he had received it   and if any one expressed the   least doubt of what he said  or desired to have these particulars   better explained  he directly charged them with making insinuations   injurious to his character and credit  which he threatened to vindicate   by law      Such a menace from such a man was not ineffectual   The in    jured lady was absolutely deprived of every means of doing herself   justice  and  as the poor are ever friendless  no unconcerned person   cared to enter into a dispute with one of his known experience    and who was acquainted with methods of putting his menaces into   execution  which the most innocent might not find it easy to guard   against  Besides  it was universally and well known  that even   if the whole afiair could be detected  he was not able to make satis    faction  Thus every circumstance concurred to give success to   his scheme  though not quite so smoothly as he could wish  and the   poor young lady  having no redress  was obhged to return to the   low state from which she had so lately been raised  and in which   she still lives a lite of servitude   happy had she never been flattered   with better hopes      But though he could escape the reach of man  Divine Justice   was not to be defeated so  Whose vengeance attacked him in so   signal a manner  as plainly showed the just retaliation of the im    erring hand of Heaven      Seared as his heart must be by such a Hfe  to the more general   feelings of humanity  nature was not quite debauched  and he felt   the tenderness and fond anxiety of paternal love in all its force   for an only daughter  on whose education  in all the polite accom    plishments of the more exalted ranks of life  he spared neither pains   nor expense  supporting and adorning her in the genteelest manner    and taking evident delight in lavishing  on such uses  all that he   could acquire by every possible means      Such a conduct  though carried to an excess  had something so    amiable in it that  in some measure  it palliated the blacker parts    of his character  and even weakened the credit of many of the   stories told of him  But just as he was beginning to enjoy the fruits    of his care  by seeing his daughter s eminence in the accomplish    ments he had taken such pains to teach universally acknowledged          130 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     an event happened  that not only deprived him of that pleasure    but also turned the merit of all his former fondness into the   foulest reproach      His daughter was observed for some time to bear the appearance   of the most poignant distress  Whenever she was asked the cause   of it by any of her friends  she would melt into a flood of tears  nor   would give any other answer than that she was the most miserable   of human beings  This raised a variety of conjectures  some of   which were far from being advantageous to her   but at length the   secret was revealed  She flew one day  in the utmost agony of   â€¢distress  to a lady of her acquaintance  who had seemed to show   the liveliest sense of her grief  and begged her protection from the   cruelty of her father  which  she said  was too great to be borne    ever since she bad refused to gratify an impious passion which he   had long entertained for her  and which had been the motive of all
