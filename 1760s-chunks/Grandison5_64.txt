gave their opinion  that she should be left entirely to the workings of her own will  And the Count proposed  by way of enforcing their opinions  that neither the Bishop and Father Marescotti on one hand  tho  religion was in the question  nor Jeronymo and myself on the other  should endeavour to prevail upon her either to alter or persevere in  her way of thinking  Jeronymo said  he desired only one conversation with his sister alone  before he complied with this proposal   They put it to me  I said  That several passages in her paper were of too solemn a nature for me to refuse my consent to their proposal  But  however  if I should observe  in future conversations between her and me  that she was inclined to alter her mind  and seemed to wish to be encouraged to declare the alteration  they must allow me  for the sake of my own honour  as a man  and of her delicacy  as a woman  to shew the ardour of my attachment to her  by my preventing declaration  and even entreaty   Page  160 The Marchioness bowed to me  with a grateful smile of approbation   Father Marescotti hesitated  as if he had something of an objection to make  but he was silenced by the Marquis s saying  On your honour  on your delicacy  I am sure  Chevalier  we may rely   I am absolutely of opinion that we may  said the Count  The Chevalier can put himself in every one s situation  and can forget his own interest  when a right and just measure is to be taken   This is true  said Jeronymo—But let it be our part to shew the Chevalier  that he is not the only man in the world who can do so   You must remember  my dear Jeronymo  said the Bishop  that Religion is a consideration superior to all others  Shall our sister  who follows the example set her by the Chevalier  he discouraged in an effort so noble  But I am willing to subscribe to the proposal  as an equal one   Father Marescotti  said I  you must return me the paper  I must often have recourse to it  to strengthen my own mind  in order to enable myself to answer your expectations   The Father desired leave to take a copy of it in shorthand  and retired for that purpose   I have no doubt but he will make great use of it with the family  and perhaps with the Lady  should there be occasion  hereafter  For my own part  if the noble Enthusiast  when the heat of her imagination is gone off  shall persist in believing that she has a divine impulse in favour of her resolution  and that given in answer to her prayers  I will endeavour to shew her  that her call upon me to support her in it  tho  against myself  shall be answered  whatever it cost me   They prevailed on me to stay dinner  She excused herself from being present  but desired to see me  when it was over   Page  161 Camilla then led me to her  I found her in tears  She was afraid  she said  that I would not forgive her  Yet I would  she was sure  if I knew the conflicts with which her soul laboured   I soothed her disturbed mind  I told her  that I desired her direction  and was resolved to pursue it  Her paper should be one of my constant lessons  and her conscience the rule of my conduct  with regard to my expectations of her favour   O Sir  said she  how good you are  It is from your generosity  next to the divine assistance  that I expect support in my resolution  I but imperfectly remember what I would have done  and what I consented to  when you were last among us—But when I best knew myself  I was more inclined to support my parents and brothers in their expectations  with regard to the two great articles of religion and residence  than to comply with yours  My fortune  my rank  merited your consideration  and my pride was sometimes piqued     But it was the regard that I had to the welfare of your immortal soul  that weighed most with me  O Sir  could you have been a Catholic    —    She then wrung her clasped hands  and tears trickled down her cheeks  God Almighty convert you  Chevalier —But you must leave me  I am beginning to be again unhappy —Leave me  Sir  But let me see you to morrow  I will pray for a composure of mind  in the mean time  Do you pray for me too     And pray for yourself  Chevalier  The welfare of your soul  your immortal soul  was ever my principal concern      She began to ramble  Her looks were a little wild  I took leave of her  and going hastily from her  in order to hide my own emotion  I surprised Father Marescotti  who  as it was at first sight evident to me  from the confusion I found him
