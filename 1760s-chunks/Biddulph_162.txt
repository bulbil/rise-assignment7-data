laid down a new scheme of happiness  and was for a time in possession of it  how I was thrown from this is still bitter to remembrance  You well know what I suffered  when I found myself deprived of my husband’s love  and suspected of a crime at which my soul shrunk  But it pleased the just God to deliver me from this heavy misfortune  and I think the happiest days of my marriage were those which I passed with Mr Arnold after our reunion  Then it was  I was thoroughly sensible that the heart can love a second time  truly and ardently  but I was soon again plunged into affliction by the death of a husband endeared to me more than ever by his misfortunes  My grief for him was proportionate to my love  Yet  my friend  as time is an universal conqueror  it might have healed this wound as well as the former one  and a few  a very few years would perhaps have disposed me to return Mr Faulkland’s still unabated passion  if a variety of circumstances had not interposed  that strongly forbad our union  Convinced as I was of this  I acted agreeably to the dictates both of my reason  and my conscience  in persuading Mr Faulkland to make Miss Burchell his wife  I should have been grieved and mortified had he rejected her  and I had determined never to have seen him more  Yet how deceitful is the human heart  this very act which I laboured with so much assiduity to accomplish  and on the accomplishment of which  I had founded  I know not how  a sort of contentment for myself  has been the very means of destroying what little peace of mind I was beginning to taste before  Sure that man was born to torment me in a variety of ways  If I was disappointed in my early love  I had however duty  and a consciousness of what I then thought superior worth  to support me  If on his account I suffered cruel and injurious aspersions  the innocence of my own self acquitted heart bore me up under it  but he has at length found the way to punish me without leaving me any resource  My pride is of no use  he has raised himself in my esteem superior to every thing  His whole behaviour so generous  so candid  a love so disinterested  so fervent  what noble  what uncommon proofs has he given me of it  and at length what a triumphant sacrifice has he made of that overruling passion  to the sober calls of reason and humanity  He has left me  my dear  to gaze after him with grateful admiration  and sometimes perhaps to sigh that our fates rendered it impossible for us to meet  But if I do sometimes sigh  it is not at the advantages of fortune  which I might have enjoyed with him  no  no  surrounded as I am with distress  I do not envy Miss Burchell’s affluence or    splendor  If that motive could have had weight with me  I might have been mean enough not to have acted as I have done  ’Tis the qualities of the man’s mind I esteem  I think our souls have something congenial in them  and that we were originally designed for each other  And if I believed the doctrine which teaches us that there are little officious spirits that preside over the actions of men  I should think that our two evil geniuses laid their heads together in conjunction with Miss Burchell’s active demon  to thwart and cross all our measures   I have nothing now left but to pray for the happiness of one whose lot in this life he has suffered me to determine  and to beseech Heaven that he may never stand in that fatal predicament which Sir George  with such outrageous barbarity  marked out in his vile letter   I now return to myself  and to my present state  which I think I may say brings up the rear of my misfortunes  Let the chastisement stop here  and I shall bow me to it with resignation   October 29  Ah  my Cecilia  what an aggravation is here to the already too deep regret I began to feel on Mr Faulkland’s account  His triumph over me is now complete   In sorting my mother’s papers  as I am to leave these lodgings tomorrow  I found that letter which Mr Faulkland wrote to my brother from Bath  You may remember I told you my mother had  in her resentment  flung it to Sir George  and that  as it happened to fall on the ground  he had quitted the room in a passion without taking it up  My mother  I suppose  when she cooled  laid it by  though I dare say she never looked into it afterwards  Read it  and see by what a fatality we have been governed   Mr Faulkland’s letter to Sir George Bidulph   Bath  May 9  1703  ‘How you mortify me  my dear Bidulph  when you tell me of the happiness I lost by staying so long at Bath  The ladies are impatient to see me  say you  Ah  Sir George  thou hast spoke better of me than I deserve  I fear   ‘I am sadly out of humour with
