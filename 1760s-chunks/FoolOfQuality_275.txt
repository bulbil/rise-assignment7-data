  trary   but it would be very hard indeed if I was to be answerable   for the honesty of every one who goes this road  If you had given   your money in charge to me  I would have been accountable for it    I believe  by the grief you are in  that you must have been losers     I will therefore forgive you your reckoning  and give you a pair of   breeches of my own into the bargain   but this is all I will do till   the law forces me      As there was no remedy  at least for the present  I accepted   his overture  and set out  But  O sir   it is impossible to describe   the horrors of my soul as I silently stepped along  casting an eye   of mingled pity and despair upon my children  I cursed in secret   my own existence  and wished for some sudden thunderbolt to   crush me into nothing  All trust in God  or his providence  had   now wholly forsaken me  and I looked upon him as neglecting all   other objects of his wrath  and exerting his omnipotence against   me and mine alone      Peggy  as I suppose  perceived how it was with me  and kept   behind a while  that she might give way to the present tumult   and distemper of my mind  At length  hoping to administer some   matter of comfort to me  she came up  and silently put a few   shillings into my hand  saying Courage  my dear husband  all   cannot be lost while we have a God who is infinitely rich to depend   upon  Ah   said I  these are the fruits of your dreams  these are your   promised blessings that heaven had in store for us  And still has   in store  she replied   the same hand that holds the rod  holds the   comforting staff also  Tell me not of comfort  I cried   I see that   the face of God is set in blackness and blasting against me  But   for me it matters not  had he not taken me at an advantage  He   sees that I have eight lives  all dearer than my own  and he is   determined to kill me in every one of them      Do not cast from you  my love  she said  the only crutch that the   world and the wretched have to rest upon  God is pleased          29o TEE FOOL OF QUALITY      perhaps  to take all human moans from us  that he may show forth   the won lers of his power in our relief  While any other hope is   left  wo are apt to trust to that hope  and we look not toward   the secret hand by which we are fed and supported   but when   all is lost  all gone  when no other stay is left  should sudden   come upon us  our comforter then becomes visible  he stands   revealed in his greatness and dory before us  and we are com    pelled to cry out  with unbelieving Thomas My Lord and my   God       Though th  e pious expostulations of my dearly beloved preacher   had little influence at the time for appeasing my own passions    I was yet pleased that my Peirgy had her secret consolations    but little imagined that her prophecy approached so near to its   completion      For two days we held on  living on such bread and milk as we   could purchase at the cottages that had the charity to receive us    But my boy who was on the breast grew exceedingly sick   so we   were obliged to shorten our journeys for the two succeeding days    partly begging  and partly paying for such victuals as we could   procure  Toward evening we came within sight of this town    Our little money was quite exhausted  and our child grown too ill   to bear further travel  so I looked about  and perceived some   roofless walls that stood off from the highway  and thither we   turned and took up our bleak abode      For the three following days I frequented the road  and by   begging procured what scantily kept my family from perishing    Mean tune my spirit was tamed and subdued by the habit of morti    fication  and I looked up to heaven  and cried Pardon  pardon    O my God  the offences and blasphemies of my murmurings   against you   You formerly blessed me with an over abundance of   blessings  and that  too  for a long season   and  as Job justly says    Shall we receive good at the hand of God
