obliged to stay another month in town  to transact the affair of his majority       Never did Emily look so lovely as this evening  there is a sweet confusion  mixed with tenderness  in her whole look and manner  which is charming beyond all expression       Adieu  I have not a moment to spare  even this absence from her is treason to love  Say every thing for me to my mother and Lucy   Yours   ED  RIVERS     LETTER CXCIII   193   To JOHN TEMPLE  Esq  Temple house  Rutland    Rose hill  Sept  22  Ten o clock   SHE is mine  my dear Temple  and I am happy almost above mortality       I cannot paint to you her loveliness  the grace  the dignity  the mild majesty of her air  is softened by a smile like that of angels  her eyes have a tender sweetness  her cheeks a blush of refined affection  which must be seen to be imagined       I envy Captain Fermor the happiness of being in the same chaise with her  I shall be very bad company to Bell  who insists on my being her cecisbeo for the journey       Adieu  The chaises are at the door   Your affectionate  ED  RIVERS     LETTER CXCIV   194   To Captain FITZGERALD    Temple house  Sept  29   I REGRET your not being with us  more than I can express       I would have every friend I love a witness of my happiness       I thought my tenderness for Emily as great as man could feel  yet find it every moment increase  every moment she is more dear to my soul       The angel delicacy of that lovely mind is inconceivable  had she no other charm  I should adore her  what a lustre does modesty throw round beauty       We remove to morrow to Bellfield  I am impatient to see my sweet girl in her little empire  I am tired of the continual crowd in which we live at Temple s  I would not pass the life he does for all his fortune  I sigh for the power of spending my time as I please  for the dear shades of retirement and friendship       How little do mankind know their own happiness  every pleasure worth a wish is in the power of almost all mankind        Blind to true joy  ever engaged in a wild pursuit of what is always in our power  anxious for that wealth which we falsely imagine necessary to our enjoyments  we suffer our best hours to pass tastelessly away  we neglect the pleasures which are suited to our natures  and  intent on ideal schemes of establishments at which we never arrive  let the dear hours of social delight escape us        Hasten to us  my dear Fitzgerald  we want only you  to fill our little circle of friends   Your affectionate  ED  RIVERS     LETTER CXCV   195   To Captain FITZGERALD   Bellfield  Oct  3   WHAT delight is there in obliging those we love       My heart dilated with joy at seeing Emily pleased with the little embellishments of her apartment  which I had made as gay and smiling as the morn  it looked  indeed  as if the hand of love had adorned it  she has a dressing room and closet of books  into which I shall never intrude  there is a pleasure in having some place which we can say is peculiarly our own  some sanctum sanctorum  whither we can retire even from those most dear to us        This is a pleasure in which I have been indulged almost from infancy  and therefore one of the first I thought of procuring for my sweet Emily       I told her I should  however  sometimes expect to be amongst her guests in this little retirement       Her look  her tender smile  the speaking glance of grateful love  gave me a transport  which only minds turned to affection can conceive  I never  my dear Fitzgerald  was happy before  the attachment I once mentioned was pleasing  but I felt a regret  at knowing the object of my tenderness had forfeited the good opinion of the world  which embittered all my happiness       She possessed my esteem  because I knew her heart  but I wanted to see her esteemed by others       With Emily I enjoy this pleasure in its utmost extent  she is the adoration of all who see her  she is equally admired  esteemed  respected       She seems to value the admiration she excites  only as it appears to gratify the pride of her lover  what transport  when all eyes are fixed on her  to see her searching around for mine  and attentive to no other object  as if insensible to all other approbation        I enjoy the pleasures of friendship as well as those of love  were you here  my dear Fitzgerald  we should be the happiest groupe on the globe  but all Bell s sprightliness cannot preserve her from an air of chagrin
