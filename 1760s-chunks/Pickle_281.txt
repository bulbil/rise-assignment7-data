and benevolence   and the pleasure of seeing my dear and tender parent often  in  some measure alleviate the chagrin to which I am subject from the  disagreeable disposition of my lord  who  consistent with his former  inconsistency  upon our last reconciliation  cheerfully agreed to a  proposal I made of having concerts in the house  and even approved of  the scheme with marks of particular satisfaction  But  before one half  of the winter was expired  he found means to banish all the company   beginning with Lord R   B    who  as he walked up stairs one evening   was stopped by a footman  who plainly told him he had orders to say to  him in particular  that his lordship was not at home  yet the very next  day  perceiving that nobleman and me walking together in the park  he  joins us with an air of alacrity  as if no such thing had happened   and even behaved to Lord R   with the most fawning complaisance   His deportment was equally absurd and impertinent to the rest of his  friends  who forsook us gradually  being tired of maintaining any  friendly communication with such a disagreeable composition of ignorance  and arrogance  For my own part  I look upon him as utterly incorrigible   and  as fate has subjected me to his power  endeavour to make the  bitter draught go down  by detaching myself as much as possible from the  supposition that there is any such existence upon earth  Indeed  if I  had not fatal experience to the contrary  I should be apt to believe  that such a character is not to be found among the sons of men  because  his conduct is altogether unaccountable by the known rules and maxims of  life  and falls entirely under the poet s observation  when he says     Tis true  no meaning puzzles more than wit    Her ladyship having thus concluded her story  to the entertainment  of the company  and the admiration of Peregrine  who expressed his    6 22 15  3 45 PM   astonishment at the variety of adventures she had undergone  which  was such as he thought sufficient to destroy the most hardy and robust  constitution  and therefore infinitely more than enough to overwhelm one  of her delicate frame  one of the gentlemen present roundly taxed her  with want of candour  in suppressing some circumstances of her life   which he thought essential in the consideration of her character   She reddened at this peremptory charge  which had an evident effect upon  the countenances of the whole audience  when the accuser proceeded  to explain his imputation  by observing  that  in the course of her  narration  she had omitted to mention a thousand acts of uncommon  charity  of which he himself knew her to be guilty  and that she had  concealed a great many advantageous proposals of marriage  which she  might have accepted before she was engaged   The company were agreeably undeceived by this explanation  which her  ladyship acknowledged in very polite terms  as a compliment equally  genteel and unexpected  And our hero  after having testified the sense  he had of her complaisance and condescension  in regaling him with a  mark of her confidence and esteem  took his leave  and went home in a  state of confusion and perplexity  for  from the circumstances of the  tale he had heard  he plainly perceived  that her ladyship s heart  was too delicate to receive such incense as he  in the capacity of an  admirer  could at present pay  because  though he had in some measure  abridged the empire of Emilia in his own breast  it was not in his own  power to restrain it so effectually  but that it would interfere with  any other sovereign whom his thoughts should adopt  and unless Lady     could engross his whole love  time  and attention  he foresaw that it  would be impossible for him to support the passion which he might have  the good fortune to inspire  He was  moreover  deterred from declaring  his love  by the fate of her former admirers  who seemed to have been  wound up to a degree of enthusiasm  that looked more like the effect of  enchantment  than the inspiration of human attractions  an ecstasy of  passion which he durst not venture to undergo  He  therefore  resolved  to combat with the impressions he had already received  and  if  possible  cultivate her friendship without soliciting her affection   But  before he could fix upon this determination  he desired to know the  footing on which he stood in her opinion  and  by the intelligence of  Crabtree  obtained in the usual manner  understood that her sentiments  of him were very favourable  though without the least tincture of love   He would have been transported with joy  had her thoughts of him been  of a more tender texture  though his reason was better pleased with  the information he received  in consequence of which he mustered up the  ideas of his first
