   I stooped to smell at the sunflower  and a great nasty worm ran into the   ground  that startled me  for I can t abide worms  Said she  Sunflowers   don t smell  So I find  replied I  And then we walked in  and Mrs    Jewkes said  Well  you have made haste now   You shall go another time       I went up to my closet  locked myself in  and opening my letter  found   in it these words           I am infinitely concerned for your distress  I most heartily wish it   may be in my power to serve and save so much innocence  beauty  and   merit  My whole dependance is upon Mr  B      and I have a near view of   being provided for by his favour to me  But yet I would sooner forfeit   all my hopes in him   trusting in God for the rest   than not assist   you  if possible  I never looked upon Mr  B     in the light he   now appears in to me  in your case  To be sure  he is no professed   debauchee  But I am entirely of opinion  you should  if possible  get   out of his hands  and especially as you are in very bad ones in Mrs    Jewkes s        We have here the widow Lady Jones  mistress of a good fortune  and a   woman of virtue  I believe  We have also old Sir Simon Darnford  and his   lady  who is a good woman  and they have two daughters  virtuous young   ladies  All the rest are but middling people  and traders  at best  I   will try  if you please  either Lady Jones  or Lady Darnford  if they ll   permit you to take refuge with them  I see no probability of keeping   myself concealed in this matter  but will  as I said  risk all things   to serve you  for I never saw a sweetness and innocence like yours  and   your hard case has attached me entirely to you  for I know  as you   so happily express  if I can serve you in this case  I shall thereby   perform all the acts of religion in one        As to Lady Davers  I will convey a letter  if you please  to her  but   it must not be from our post house  I give you caution  for the man   owes all his bread to Mr  B      and his place too  and I believe  by   something that dropt from him  over a can of ale  has his instructions    You don t know how you are surrounded  all which confirms me in your   opinion  that no honour is meant you  let what will be professed  and I   am glad you want no caution on that head        Give me leave to say  that I had heard much in your praise  but  I   think  greatly short of what you deserve  both as to person and mind    My eyes convince me of the one  your letter of the other  For fear   of losing the present lucky opportunity  I am longer than otherwise I   should be  But I will not enlarge  any further than to assure you that I   am  to the best of my power                              Your faithful friend and servant                                                       ARTHUR WILLIAMS         I will come once every morning  and once every evening  after   school time  to look for your letters  I ll come in  and return without   going into the house  if I see the coast clear  Otherwise  to avoid   suspicion  I ll come in           I instantly  in answer to this pleasing letter  wrote as follows           REVEREND SIR        O how suited to your function  and your character  is your kind letter    God bless you for it  I now think I am beginning to be happy  I should   be sorry to have you suffer on my account  but I hope it will be made   up to you an hundred fold  by that God whom you so faithfully serve
