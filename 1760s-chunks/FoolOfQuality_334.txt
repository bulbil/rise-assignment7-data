there is one power  one quality   which God cannot make creaturely  which with all his omnipo    tence he cannot possibly impart  in any kind of distinction or   separability  from himself  and this quality is called Goodness      And now  my dear lord  in order to convince you of this most   capital and most important of all truths  a truth upon which time    eternity  and the universe all turn  as on their axis  it may be   necessary to inquire what Goodness is      There is no species of allowed or conceivable virtue that is not   reducible under the standard of their great leader  and all gene    rating parent  called Love  Good will is the eternal blesser of all   to whom it is beneficent  and also generates its own blessing in   the very act of its love      Here lies the great and impassable gulf between God and his         368 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      productions  between the creature arid the Creator  The will ot   God is an eternal fire of love toward his creatures  and goes forth   in blessings upon them as wide and universal as his own existence    L ut the will of the creature is confined and limited  like its essence    While it is distinct from  or uninformed by the will of God  it   cannot possibly act beyond or out of itself  it cannot possibly   feel for any thing except itself   it cannot wish any welfare except   its own welfare  and this it endeavours to compass by the exertion   of all its powers      From this distinct  selfish  and craving will of the creature    springs every possible evil  whether natural or moral  From   the preference of its own identity to that of others  ariseth pride     from the eagerness of its grasping at all advantages to itself    ariseth the envy of any imaginary advantage to another  Pride    covetousness  and envy beget hatred  wrath  and contention  with   every species and degree of malevolence and malignity   and the   disappointment of these passions produces rancour and misery    and all together they constitute the whole nature and kingdom   of hell itself in the soul      But when God is pleased to inform the will of the creature   with any measure of his own benign and benevolent will  he steals   it sweetly forth in affection to others   he speaks peace to the   storm of rending passions   and a new and delightful dawning   arises on the spirit  And thus  on the grand and final consumma    tion  when every will shall be subdued to the will of good to all    our Jesus will take in hand the resigned cordage of our hearts    he will tune them  with so many instruments  to the song of his   own sentiments  and will touch them with the finger of his own   divine feelings  Then shall the wisdom  the might  and the good    ness of our God  become the wisdom  might  and goodness of all   his intelligent creatures   the happiness of each shall multiply and   overflow in the wishes and participation of the happiness of all     the universe shall begin to sound with the song of congratulation     and all voices shall break forth in an eternal hallelujah of praise    transcending praise and glory  transcending glory to God and   the Lamb       Purblind reason here will say  even the goodness of God himself   in the human heart will say If our God is all love  if he is a   will to all rectitude and happiness in his creatures  why did he   suffer any evil to begin in nature and creature  Could evil have   arisen contrary to the will of Omnipotence  if Omnipotence had   willed that it should not arise       Ah  my friends  no evil ever did  nor ever can approach the   will of God   neither can he will or effect any species of evil in   nature or creature  but he can allow a temporary evil in the   creature  as a travail towards its birth into the more eminent   degree of that goodness and happiness which God effects  God   cannot effect or take delight in the sufferings of the most abandoned   reprobate that ever blasphemed his name   but he can will that   the sinner should be reclaimed to happiness  even by suffering    when there are no other means in nature whereby he may be   reclaimed          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  369     Could creatures  without the experience of any lapse or evil    have been made duly sensible
