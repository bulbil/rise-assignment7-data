man is not intitled to be treated as a Gentleman  who denies to one—  Of whose making  Mr  Bagenhall  are the Laws of Honour you mention  I own no Laws  but the Laws of GOD and my Country  But  to cut this matter short  tell Sir Hargrave  that  little as is the dependence a Man of Honour can have upon that of a man  who has acted by an helpless woman  as he has acted by Miss Byron  I will breakfast with him in his own house to morrow morning  if he contradicts it not  I will attribute to the violence of his passion for the Lady  the unmanly outrage he was guilty of  I will suppose him mistaken enough to imagine  that he should make her amends by marriage  if he could compel her hand  and will trust my person to his honour  one servant only to walk before his door  not to enter the house  to attend my commands  after our   27 conversation is over  My sword  and my sword only  shall be my companion  But this rather  that I would not be thought to owe my safety to the want of it  than in expectation  after such confidence placed in him  to have occasion to draw it in my own defence  And pray  Mr  Bagenhall  do you  his friend  be present  and any other friends  and to what number  he pleases   When I came to this place in my cousin s Minutes  I was astonished  I was out of breath upon it   Mr  Bagenhall was surprised  and asked Sir Charles  if he were in earnest   I would not be thought a rash man  Mr  Bagenhall  Sir Hargrave threatens me  I never avoid a threatener  You seem to hint  Sir  that I am not intitled to fair play  if I consent not to meet him with a murderous intention  With such an intention I never will meet any man  though I have as much reason to rely on the skill of my arm  as on the justice of my cause  If foul play is hinted at  I am no more safe from an assassin in my bedchamber  than in Sir Hargrave s house  Something must be done by a man who refuses a challenge  to let a challenger see  such is the world  such is the custom  that he has better motives than fear  for his refusal  I will put Sir Hargrave s Honour to the fullest test  Tell him  Sir  that I will bear a great deal  but that I will not be insulted  were he a Prince   And you really would have me—  I would  Mr  Bagenhall  Sir Hargrave  I see  will not be satisfied  unless something extraordinary be done  And if I hear not from you  or from him  I will attend him by ten to morrow morning  in an amicable manner  to breakfast at his own house in Cavendish Square   I am in terror  Lucy  even in transcribing only   Mr  Reeves  said Sir Charles  you undo me  if one word of this matter escape you  even to your wife     28 Mr  Reeves begged  that he might attend him to Sir Hargrave s   By no means  Mr  Reeves   Then  Sir Charles  you apprehend danger   I do not  Something  as I said  must be done  This is the shortest and best method to make all parties easy  Sir Hargrave thinks himself slighted  He may infer  if he pleases  in his own favour  that I do not despise a man  in whom I can place such a confidence  Do you  Mr  Reeves  return to company  and let no one know the occasion of your absence  or of mine  from it   I have told you  my dear  what a difference there was in the countenances of both  when each separately entered the dining room  And could this great man  surely I may call him great  could he  in such circumstances  on his return  give joy  pleasure  entertainment  to all the company  without the least cause of suspicion of what had passed   Mr  Reeves  as I told you  singled out Sir Charles in the evening to know what had passed after he left him and Mr  Bagenhall  Sir Charles acquainted him  that Mr  Bagenhall had proposed to let him know that night  or in the morning  how Sir Hargrave approved of his intended visit  He has  accordingly  signified to me already  said Sir Charles  that Sir Hargrave expects me   And will you go  Sir   Don t give yourself concern about the matter  Mr  Reeves  All must end well  My intention is  not to run into mischief  but to prevent it  My principles are better known abroad  than they are in England  I have been challenged more than once by men  who knew them  and thought to find their safety from them  I have been obliged to take some extraordinary steps to save myself
