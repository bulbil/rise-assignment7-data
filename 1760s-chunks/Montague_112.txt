not suffer from my too anxious tenderness  I dread the possibility of my becoming in time less dear to your brother  I love him to such excess that I could not survive the loss of his affection       There is no distress  no want  I could not bear with delight for him  but if I lose his heart  I lose all for which life is worth keeping       Could I bear to see those looks of ardent love converted into the cold glances of indifference       You will  my dearest friend  pity a heart  whose too great sensibility wounds itself  why should I fear  was ever tenderness equal to that of my Rivers  can a heart like his change from caprice  It shall be the business of my life to merit his tenderness       I will not give way to fears which injure him  and  indulged  would destroy all my happiness       I expect Mr  and Mrs  Fitzgerald every moment  Adieu       Your affectionate        EMILY MONTAGUE     LETTER CLXXXIII   183   To Captain FITZGERALD   Bellfield  Sept  17   YOU say true  my dear Fitzgerald  friendship  like love  is more the child of sympathy than of reason  though inspired by qualities very opposite to those which give love  it strikes like that in a moment  like that  it is free as air  and  when constrained  loses all its spirit       In both  from some nameless cause  at least some cause to us incomprehensible  the affections take fire the instant two persons  whose minds are in unison  observe each other  which  however  they may often meet without doing        It is therefore as impossible for others to point out objects of our friendship as love  our choice must be uninfluenced  if we wish to find happiness in either       Cold  lifeless esteem may grow from a long tasteless acquaintance  but real affection makes a sudden and lively impression       This impression is improved  is strengthened by time  and a more intimate knowledge of the merit of the person who makes it  but it is  it must be  spontaneous  or be nothing       I felt this sympathy powerfully in regard to yourself  I had the strongest partiality for you before I knew how very worthy you were of my esteem       Your countenance and manner made an impression on me  which inclined me to take your virtues upon trust       It is not always safe to depend on these preventive feelings  but in general the face is a pretty faithful index of the mind       I propose being in town in four or five days   Twelve o clock       My mother has this moment a second letter from her relation  who is coming home  and proposes a marriage between me and his daughter  to whom he will give twenty thousand pounds now  and the rest of his fortune at his death       As Emily s fault  if love can allow her one  is an excess of romantic generosity  the fault of most uncorrupted female minds  I am very anxious to marry her before she knows of this proposal  lest she should think it a proof of tenderness to aim at making me wretched  in order to make me rich       I therefore entreat you and Mrs  Fitzgerald to stay at Rose hill  and prevent her coming to town  till she is mine past the power of retreat       Our relation may have mentioned his design to persons less prudent than our little party  and she may hear of it  if she is in London       But  independently of my fear of her spirit of romance  I feel that it would be an indelicacy to let her know of this proposal at present  and look like attempting to make a merit of my refusal       It is not to you  my dear friend  I need say the gifts of fortune are nothing to me without her for whose sake alone I wish to possess them  you know my heart  and you also know this is the sentiment of every man who loves       But I can with truth say much more  I do not even wish an increase of fortune  considering it abstractedly from its being incompatible with my marriage with the loveliest of women  I am indifferent to all but independence  wealth would not make me happier  on the contrary  it might break in on my present little plan of enjoyment  by forcing me to give to common acquaintance  of whom wealth will always attract a crowd  those precious hours devoted to friendship and domestic pleasure       I think my present income just what a wise man would wish  and very sincerely join in the philosophical prayer of the royal prophet   Give me neither poverty nor riches        I love the vale  and had always an aversion to very extensive prospects       I will hasten my coming as much as possible  and hope to be at Rose hill on Monday next  I shall be a prey to anxiety till Emily is irrevocably mine       Tell Mrs
