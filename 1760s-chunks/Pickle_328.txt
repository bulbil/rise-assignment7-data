 his power  so that it could not be reasonably expected that he would  pay ten thousand pounds of his debt  for which he had received no  value  Peregrine  in spite of his chagrin  could not help owning within  himself  that there was a good deal of reason in this refusal  After  having given loose to his indignation in the most violent invectives  against the defunct  he took his leave of the complaisant heir  and had  immediate recourse to the advice of counsel  who assured him that he had  an excellent plea  and was accordingly retained in the cause   All these measures were taken in the first vigour of his exertion   during which his spirits were so fluttered with the diversity of  passions produced by his mischance  that he mistook for equanimity that  which was no other than intoxication  and two whole days elapsed before  he attained a due sense of his misfortune  Then  indeed  he underwent a  woeful self examination  every circumstance of the inquiry added fresh  pangs to his reflection  and the result of the whole was a discovery   that his fortune was totally consumed  and himself reduced to a state  of the most deplorable dependence  This suggestion alone might  in the  anguish of his despondency  have driven him to some desperate course   had it not been in some measure qualified by the confidence of his  lawyers  and the assurance of the minister  which  slender as the world  hath generally found them  were the only bulwarks between misery and  him   The mind is naturally pliable  and  provided it has the least hope to  lean upon  adapts itself wonderfully to the emergencies of fortune   especially when the imagination is gay and luxuriant  This was the case  with our adventurer  instead of indulging the melancholy ideas which  his loss inspired  he had recourse to the flattering delusions of hope   soothing himself with unsubstantial plans of future greatness  and  endeavouring to cover what was past with the veil of oblivion  After  some hesitation  he resolved to make Crabtree acquainted with his  misfortune  that once for all he might pass the ordeal of his satire     6 22 15  3 45 PM   without subjecting himself to a long series of sarcastic hints and  doubtful allusions  which he could not endure  He accordingly took the  first opportunity of telling him that he was absolutely ruined by the  perfidy of his patron  and desired that he would not aggravate his  affliction by those cynical remarks which were peculiar to men of his  misanthropical disposition  Cadwallader listened to this declaration  with internal surprise  which  however  produced no alteration in his  countenance  and  after some pause  observed  that our hero had no  reason to look for any new observation from him upon this event  which  he had long foreseen  and daily expected  and exhorted him  with an  ironical sneer  to console himself with the promise of the minister  who  would doubtless discharge the debts of his deceased bosom friend   CHAPTER XCIII   Peregrine commits himself to the Public  and is admitted Member of a  College of Authors   The bitterness of this explanation being passed  our young gentleman  began to revolve within himself schemes for making up the deficiencies  of his yearly income  which was now so grievously reduced  and  determined to profit  in some shape or other  by those talents which he  owed to nature and education  He had  in his affluence  heard of several  authors  who  without any pretensions to genius or human literature   earned a very genteel subsistence by undertaking work for booksellers   in which reputation was not at all concerned  One  for example   professed all manner of translation  at so much per sheet  and actually  kept five or six amanuenses continually employed  like so many clerks in  a counting house  by which means he was enabled to live at his ease  and  enjoy his friend and his bottle  ambitious of no other character than  that of an honest man and a good neighbour  Another projected a variety  of plans for new dictionaries  which were executed under his eye by  day labourers  and the province of a third was history and voyages   collected or abridged by understrappers of the same class   Mr  Pickle  in his comparisons  paid such deference to his own  capacity  as banished all doubts of his being able to excel any of those  undertakers in their different branches of profession  if ever he should  be driven to that experiment  but his ambition prompted him to make his  interest and glory coincide  by attempting some performance which  should do him honour with the public  and at the same time establish  his importance among the copy purchasers in town  With this view  he  worshipped the muse  and  conscious of the little regard which is in  this age paid to every species of poetic composition  in which neither  satire nor obscenity occurs  he produced an imitation of Juvenal   and lashed some conspicuous characters
