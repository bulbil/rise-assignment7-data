one of mine between   them I love you no longer  my Harry  she cried   I love you no   longer  Your rival at length has conquered   I am the bride of   another  And yet I love you in a measure  since in you I love   all that is him  or that is his   and that I think is much  a great   deal  indeed  of all that is lovely  O  my dear  my sweet  mine   only enemy  as I may say   riches were nothing unto me  pleasures   were nothing unto me  the world was nothing unto me   You  and   you only  Harry stood between me and my heaven  between me   and my God  Long  and often  and vainly  have I strove and   struggled against you  but my bridegroom at length is become   jealous of you   my true owner calls me from you  and takes me   all to himself   Be not alarmed then  my Harry  when I tell you that   I must leave you  You will grieve for me you will grieve greatly   for me  my beloved   but give way to the kindly shower that your   Lord shed for his Lazarus  and let the tears of humanity alleviate   and lighten the weight of your affliction  Ah  my Harry   I tremble   for you   what a course you have to run   what perils   what   temptations  Deliver him from them  my Master  deliver him   from them all  Again  what blissful prospects they are gone    they are vanished   I sink  I die under the weight and length of   succeeding misery   Again it opens   all is cleared   and his end    like that of Job  is more blessed than his beginning  Ah  my   Harry  my Harry   your heart must be wrung by many engines     it shall be tried in many fires   but I trust it is a golden heart  and   will come forth with all its weight    You have been dreaming  my love  I said you have been         204 TEE FOOL OF QUALITY      dreaming  and the impression still lies heavy and melancholy on   your memory      Yes  she replied  I have been dreaming  indeed   but then my   dreams are much more real than my waking visions  When all   things sensible are shut out  it is then that the spirit enlarges    grows conscious of its own activity  its own power and prescience    and sees by a light whose evidence is beyond that of the sun      O  my angel  I cried  should anything happen to you But  I   dare not look that way   for I know  I find  I feel that I could not   survive you      You must survive me  my Harry   nay  you will once more be   married  I beheld your bride last night  Even now she stands   before me  the sister of my spirit  and one of the loveliest composi    tions of sin and death that ever was framed for dissolution  Her   also you will lose   and you will think  nay  you will assure your    self  that no powers in heaven or earth can avail for a ray of   comfort  In this life  however  you will finally  unexpectedly  and   most wonderfully be blessed   and soon after we shall all meet  and   be more intimately and more endearingly wedded than ever  where   yet there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage       While yet she spoke  her pains  as the pains of labour  again came   upon her  and went off  and again returned  after intermitting   swoonings      0  my cousin   what a solemn  what a fearful thing is death   All   our inlets of knowledge and sensation closed at once   the sound of   cheer  and the voice of friendship  and the comfort of light  shut   out from us for ever   Nothing before us but a blackness and depth   of oblivion   or  beyond it  a doubtful and alarming sensibility     strange scenes and strange worlds  strange associates and strange   perceptions  perhaps of horrid realities  infinitely worse than non    entity   Such are the brightest prospects of infidelity in death       Where  at that time  are your scoffers  your defiers of futurity    where your merry companions  who turn their own eternity into   matter of laugh and ridicule   Dejected and aghast
