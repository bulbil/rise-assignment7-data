in a coach  which should carry them a few miles out of town  where the horses were to wait for them   Worthy  compassionate  and generous kinsman  how I love you for the honest warmth of your heart   My brother and Mr Faulkland had a great deal of discourse about the necessary measures that were to be taken by us all  and we passed the evening in a kind of chastened satisfaction  which could not arise to happiness from the near prospect we had of parting   About ten o’clock my brother took an affectionate leave of his friend  he excused himself from accompanying him on his journey  on account of Lady Sarah’s not being well   To see such a parting  would at another time have deeply affected me  but my own hour of separation drew near  It came  and Mr Warner punctual to his time  hurried Mr Faulkland almost by force into the coach  and drove off with him   I threw myself into a chair which he had ordered for me  and was carried home  I went not to bed  but had recourse to my pen  God preserve my dear fugitive  I can do nothing but weep   July 2  My mind was too much unsettled yesterday to dictate any thing coherent  I am now  thank heaven  more composed  Sir George and Lady Sarah have been with me during the greatest part of the day  both kind and consoling  My brother seems to have all his former affection for me revived in his heart  he is indeed charmed with my justice  as he calls it  Lady Sarah  who at the bottom of her heart is no way concerned about this event  affects however to think as her husband does  and commends me for my generosity   I feel myself easier in proportion as I think Mr Faulkland gets farther out of the reach of danger  Sir George says by this time he may be on his voyage   I shall certainly wait till the child arrives  in order to take him with    me  My two little girls will be fond of such a brother  for he is a charming boy   My brother flatters me with a possibility at least of Major Smyth’s recovering  and if so  he says that Mr Faulkland may stand his trial for the other accident  as he is in hopes Smyth will not persist in his villainy so far as to add perjury to his other crimes   I have but little expectations of justice from so bad a man  but I would not discourage my friends in their endeavours to comfort me   July 3  Mr Warner is returned from Harwich  after having seen Mr Faulkland safe on board the packet  and even under sail for Holland   What a benevolent heart has this good relation of mine  Indeed I dearly love and respect him  His return has revived my spirits  and I begin to lose my fears  He brought me a short letter from Mr Faulkland  short it is  but his heart speaks in every syllable of it  I will not give you the contents  my Cecilia  you will think it too extravagant  too romantic  for a husband to write so to his wife   July 6  I long  yet dread to hear accounts from Ireland  I fear that wretched Smyth is dead  No mail has arrived from thence these eight days  Contrary winds they tell me detain the packets on the other side very often for a fortnight together  If that be so  how fortunate was Mr Faulkland in seizing on a lucky hour for his departure from the Irish shore   I suppose Mr Bond’s family  whom he must have rendered very unhappy  particularly the daughter  are all now his implacable enemies  and are tormenting themselves in being detained from the pursuit of their vengeance  But let them come now when they will  he is far out of the reach of his foes   I would it were possible for my Cecilia  to arrive in England before my departure for Holland  Indeed  my dear  I shall not be sorry if I am detained from Mr Faulkland  till I have the happiness of first embracing you  as our separation may be afterwards of a long continuance  I shall wait for the arrival of Master Faulkland  and who knows what adverse winds may detain him till your return  O  that I may pass though it be but one day  with the dear companion of my youth before we are again divided   I will not send this packet off  till I am ready to depart from    England  as that will be closing an important period of my life  What would I give that my dearest friend would come  and instead of this tedious narrative which I have written  receive the account from my own lips  If my wishes should not be granted in this  cannot you make Holland your way home  Mr Faulkland purposes staying at the Hague till I go to him   July 9  Cecilia  have I been a murmurer at the decrees of providence  have I been an impious repiner when heaven has poured down its wrath upon my head  if not  why am I marked out for divine vengeance
