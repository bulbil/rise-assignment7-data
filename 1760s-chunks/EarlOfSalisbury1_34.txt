promised should be speedy  He spoke of the present  alarm as of no moment  but declared himself resolved to learn the  occasion of it  They obeyed  and he returned into the castle  where he  appeared opportunely to prevent suspicion or detection  The domestics  were all roused  and some had already mounted the battlements to  demand  who  at this dead hour  had approached the castle  and on what  occasion  They were answered  that there stood two persons at the gates  dispatched by Hubert chief justiciary  to Lord Raymond on especial  affairs  that they had been misguided  and wandered thro  the country  until night had overtaken them  that at length they had recovered the  true path  and that their fatigue required immediate entrance and  refreshment  By the command of Oswald  they were admitted and  entertained with due courtesy  He  tho  determined to abandon the  service of Raymond  and impatient to rejoin the Countess  and her son   yet could not resist the desire of conferring with these messengers  and  especially when he learned from one of them  who seemed of inferior  quality  that they brought some intelligence about lord Salisbury  He  invited this man to refresh himself with wine  for the other had retired  to rest   He entertained him with all hospitable kindness  and from him  learned  that but a little time since  solemn justs and tournaments had  been held at the English court  in which a young knight of France   induced as he declared  by the fame of the gallant nobles of Britain   had appeared  and distinguished himself by his prowess and courage  That  the King and his courtiers had received him with all due honours  that  in some conversations  he had lamented the  fate of an English Lord known in both realms by the name of Salisbury   who as he was informed  had been pursued by adverse fortune in Poictou   obliged to fly before his enemies  abandoned by his few attendants  and  accompanied only by a fair and noble lady  and that too strong reasons  there were to fear that he had perished  Oswald heard him with a violent  yet well dissembled emotion  and having prevailed on him to retire   paused  tho  still anxious to seek the Countess  and debated within his  mind  whether he should communicate this intelligence or no  As he was  not sufficiently acquainted with the refined and exalted sentiments of  noble minds  he concluded that the hopes of her Lord s return were Ela s  only motive for receiving the addresses of Lord Raymond with such  severity and abhorrence  and that any assurances of his death  must  determine her to accept the tenders of his love  he therefore resolved  freely to declare what he had just now heard  and hoped that she might  thus be prevailed on to abandon the design of flying  and to return to  her castle     The domestics were now separated  and silence and tranquillity again  restored  when Oswald again issued forth  still firmly resolved to obey  the commands of the Countess  whatever these might be  and faithfully  to follow her fortunes  should she be still resolute to tempt the  dangers of flight  He found her at the appointed station impatient of  his tedious absence  and almost sinking under the terrors of night and  solitude  Elinor sat by her side  still more dismayed  supporting her  young son  and shielding him from the dampy air whilst he lay composed  in peaceful sleep  The moon was hastening to her decline  and threatened  to involve them in all the horrors of darkness  when their long expected  protector at length appeared to relieve their distracting fears  He  briefly related the occasion of his delay  the arrival of these  messengers  and the discourse which he had held with one of them  The  bare mention of intelligence about Lord William  raised an universal  agitation in the Countess  The melancholy air  which Oswald assumed  encreased her terror and impatience  nor had he  yet finished his relation  when the blood deserted the cheeks of Ela   She closed her eyes  and died away  Elinor shrieked  Oswald supported  her  but their cares were a long time ineffectual  At length  the  Countess raised her languid front  and breathed a heart felt sigh   He  was then disloyal   said she —        A noble lady  —was she noble —But alas  I fear  heaven hath severely  punished his guilt         Oswald now perceived his own imprudence  and would have offered  comfort  but the Countess was wholly engaged by her own sad thoughts  He  repeatedly prest and enforced the danger of her present situation  and  the necessity of speedy departure  but no attention could he gain  At  length  turning her sadly streaming eyes slowly upon him   No  my  friend   said she       these languid limbs must here find their grave —Yet —it were a blessing
