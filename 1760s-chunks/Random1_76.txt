fain to move my lodging and dwell two pair of stairs higher than before  My companion being disappointed in her expectations  left me  to trade upon her own bottom  and I had no other resource  than to venture forth like the owls  in the dark  to pick up a precarious and uncomfortable subsistence  I have often sauntered between Ludgate hill and Charing cross  a whole winter night  exposed not only to the inclemency of the weather  but likewise to the rage of hunger and thirst  without being so happy as to meet with one cully  then creep up to my garret in a deplorable  draggled condition  sneak to bed  and try to bury my appetite and sorrows in sleep —When I lighted on some rake or tradesman reeling home drunk  I frequently suffered the most brutal treatment  in spite of which I was obliged to affect gaiety and good humour  tho  my soul was stung with resentment and disdain  and my heart loaded with grief and affliction —In the course of these nocturnal adventures  I was infected with the disease  that in a short time render d me the object of my own abhorrence  and drove me to the retreat  where   215 your benevolence rescued me from the jaws of death   So much candour and good sense appeared in this lady s narration  that I made no scruple of believing every syllable of what she said  and expressed my astonishment at the variety of miseries she had undergone  in so little time  for all her misfortunes had happened within the compass of two years —I compared her situation with my own  and found it a thousand times more wretched  I had endured hardships   tis true  my whole life had been a series of such  and when I looked forward  the prospect was not much bettered—but then  they were become habitual to me  and consequently  I could bear them with less difficulty—If one scheme of life should not succeed  I could have recourse to another  and so to a third  veering about to a thousand different shifts  according to the emergencies of my fate  without forfeiting the dignity of my character  beyond a power of retrieving it  or subjecting myself wholly to the caprice and barbarity of the world  On the other hand  she had known and relished the sweets of prosperity  she had been brought up under the wings of an indulgent parent  in all the delicacies to which her sex and rank entitled her  and without any extravagance of hope  entertained herself with the view of uninterrupted happiness thro  the whole scene of life—How fatal then  how tormenting  how intolerable must her reverse of fortune be  a reverse  that not only robbs her of these external comforts  and plunges her into all the miseries of want  but also murthers her peace of mind  and entails upon her the curse of eternal infamy —Of all professions I pronounced   216 that of a courtezan the most deplorable  and her of all courtezans the most unhappy —She allowed my observation to be just in the main  but at the same time  affirmed  that notwithstanding the disgraces which had fallen to her share  she had not been so unlucky in the condition of a prostitute as many others of the same community —   I have often seen  said she  while I strolled about the streets at mid night  a number of naked wretches reduced to rags and filth  huddled together like swine  in the corner of a dark alley  some of whom  but eighteen months before  I had known the favourites of the town  rolling in affluence  and glittering in all the pomp of equi and dress  —  And indeed the gradation is easily conceived  the most fashionable woman of the town is as liable to contagion  as one in a much humbler sphere  she infects her admirers  her situation is publick  she is avoided  neglected  unable to support her usual appearance  which however she strives to maintain as long as possible  her credit fails  she is obliged to retrench and become a night walker  her malady gains ground  she tampers with her constitution and ruins it  her complexion fades  she grows nauseous to every body  finds herself reduced to a starving condition  is tempted to pick pockets  is detected  committed to Newgate  where she remains in a miserable condition   till she is discharged because the plaintiff appears not to prosecute her  No body will afford her lodging  the symptoms of her distemper are grown outrageous  she sues to be admitted into an hospital  where she is cured at the expence of her nose  she is turned out naked into the streets  depends upon the addresses of the canaille  is fain to allay the rage of   217 hunger and cold with gin  degenerates into a state of brutal insensibility  rots and dies upon a dunghill —Miserable wretch that I am  perhaps the same horrors are decreed for me —   No  cried she after some pause  I shall never live to such extremity of distress  my own hand shall open a way for my deliverance  before I arrive at that forlorn period  —  Her condition filled me with sympathy and compassion  I revered her qualifications  looked upon her as
