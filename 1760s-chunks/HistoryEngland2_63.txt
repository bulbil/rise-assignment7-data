which could produce no good  and campaigns  whether successful or not  that could only terminate in misfortune  When the parliament met  his Majesty informed them of his strict adherence to his engagements  though attacked in his own dominions  and that he had augmented the British forces in the Low Countries with sixteen thousand Hanoverians  When the supplies came to be considered  by which this additional number of troops was to be paid  it raised violent debates in both houses  It was considered as hiring the troops of the Electorate to fight their own cause  The ministry  however  who were formerly remarkable for declaiming against continental measures  now boldly stood up for them  and  at length  by dint of number  carried their cause  The people saw  with pain  their former defenders sacrificing the blood and treasure of the nation upon destructive alliances  they knew not now on whom to rely for safety  and began to think that patriotism was but an empty name  However injurious these measures might have been to the nation  they were of infinite service to the Queen of Hungary  She began  at this period  to triumph over all her enemies  The French were driven out of Bohemia  Her general  Prince Charles  at the head of a large army  invaded the dominions of Bavaria  Her rival  the nominal Emperor  was obliged to fly before her  abandoned by his allies  and stripped of all his dominions  he repaired to Francfort  where he lived in indigence and obscurity  He agreed to remain neuter during the remainder of he war  while the French  who first began it as alies  supported the burthen  The troops sent by England to the Queen s assistance were commanded by the Earl of Stair  an experienced commander  who had learned the art of war under the famous   710 Prince Eugene  and the chief object he had first in view was  to effect a junction with the army commanded by Prince Charles of Lorrain  The French  in order to prevent this junction  assembled sixty thousand men upon the river Mayne  under the command of Marshal Noailles  who posted his troops upon the east side of that river  The British forces  to the number of forty thousand  pushed forward on the other side  while the French  in the mean time  found means to cut off all the communications by which they could be supplied with provisions  The King of England arrived at the camp while the army was in this situation  and seeing it in danger of starving  resolved to proceed forward  to join twelve thousand Hanoverians and Hessians  who had reached Hanau  With this view he decamped  but before the army had marched three leagues  he found the enemy had inclosed him on every side  near a village called Detingen   In this situation he must have fought at great disadvantage  if he began the attack  and if he continued in the same situation  his army must have perished for want o subsistence  The impetuosity of the French  however  saved the English army  they passed a defil which they should have guarded  and  under the conduct of the Duke of Gramont  their horse charged with great impetuosity  They were received by the English infantry with undaunted resolution  th French were obliged to give way  and to pass th Mayne with great precipitation  with the loss o about five thousand  The King  who was possesse of personal courage  which seems hereditary to th family  exposed himself to a severe fire of cannon as well as musquetry  and  in the midst of the rank encouraged his troops  by his presence and example The whole of the battle  on either side  exhibited mo… courage than conduct  The English had the hono… of the day  but the French soon after took possessi… of the field of batle  treating the wounded Engli…  171 that were left behind with a clemency unprecedented in ancient history  and that serves to shew how much superior the present times are in point of humanity to the boasted ages of antiquity  Though the English were victorious upon this occasion  yet the Earl of Stair  who commanded  did not assume any honour from such a victory  he was unwilling that his reputation should suffer for measures  which he was not allowed to conduct  he therefore solicited  and obtained leave to resign  and the British troops desisted from further operations that campaign   Mean while the French went on with vigour on every quarter  they opposed Prince Charles of Lorrain  and interrupted his progress in his attempts to pass the Rhine  gained some successes in Italy  but their chief expectations were placed in a projected invasion of England  Cardinal Fleury was now dead  and Cardinal Tencin succeeded to his place a person of a very different character from his predecessor  proud  turbulent  and enterprizing  France  from the violence of parliamentary disputes in England  had been long persuaded that the country was ripe for a revolution  and only wanted the presence of the Pretender to induce the majority to declare against the reigning family  Several needy adventurers  who wished for a change  some men of broken fortunes  and almost all the Roman Catholics of the kingdom  endeavoured to confirm the court of France
