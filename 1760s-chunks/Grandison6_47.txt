and leave the future to the All wise Diposer of events  If Sir Charles Grandison be mine  and reward by his kindness my Love  what can befal• me  that I ought not to bear with resignation     117 But  my dear Ladies  let me here ask you a question  or two   Tell me  Did I ever  as you remember  suffer by suspenses  by any  thing —Was there ever really such a man as Sir Hargrave Pollexfen —Did I not tell you my dreams  when I told you of what I believed I had undergone from his persecuting insults  It is well  for the sake of preserving to me the grace of humility  and for the sake of warning  for all my days preceding that insult had been happy  that I wrote down at the time an account of those sufferings  those sufferings  or I should have been apt to forget now  that I ever was unhappy   And  pray  let me ask  Ladies  Can you guess what is become of my illness  I was very ill  you know  when you  Lady G  did us the honour of a visit  so ill  that I could not hide it from you  and my other dear friends  as fain I would have done  I did not think it was an illness of such a nature  as that its cure depended on an easy heart  I wa so much convinced of the merits of Lady Clementina  and that no other woman in the world ought to be Lady Grandison  that I thought I had pretty tolerably quieted my heart in that expectation  I hope I brag not too soon  But  my dear  I now see  so easy  so light  so happy—that I hardly know what s the matter with me—But I hope nobody will find the malady I have lost  May no disappointed heart be invaded by it  Let it not travel to Italy  The dear Lady there has suffered enough from a worse malady  Nor  if it stay in the island  let it come near the sighing heart of my Emily  That dear girl shall be happy  if it be in my power to make her so  Pray  Ladies  tell her she shall —No  but don t  I will tell her so myself by the next post  Nor let it  I pray God  attack Lady Anne S  or any of the half score Ladies  of whom once I was so unwilling to hear     118 Our discourse at table was on various subjects  My cousin James was again very inquisitive after the principal courts  and places of note  in Italy   What pleasure do I hope one day to receive from the perusal  if I shall be favoured with it  of Sir Charles s LITERARY JOURNAL  mentioned to Dr  Bartlett  in some of his Letters from Italy  For it includes  I presume  a description of palaces  cities  cabinets of the curious  diversions  amusements  customs  of different nations  How attentive were we all  to the answers he made to my cousin James s questions  My memory serves but for a few generals  and those I will not trouble you with  Sir Charles told my cousin that if he were determined on an excursion abroad  he would furnish him with recommendatory Letters   Mr  Greville and his insult were one of our subjects after dinner  when the servants were withdrawn  Lucy expressed her wonder  that he was so soon reconciled to Sir Charles  after the menaces he had for years past thrown out against any man who should be likely to succeed with me   My uncle observed  that Mr  Greville had not for a long time had any hopes  that he always was apprehensive  that if Sir Charles Grandison were to make his addresses  he would succeed  That it had been his and Fenwick s custom  to endeavour to bluster away their competitors  a   He possibly  my uncle added  might hope to intimidate Sir Charles  or at least  knowing his principles  might suppose he ran no risque in the attempt   Mr  Deane said  Mr  Greville had told him  that the moment he knew Miss Byron had chosen her man  he would give up his pretensions  but that  as long as she remained single  he was determined to persecute her  as he himself called it  Perseverance he had   119 known do every thing  after an admired woman had run through her circle of humble servants  and perhaps found herself disappointed in her own choice  and for his part  but with her  he had no fondness for the married life  he cared not who knew it   Sir Charles spoke of Mr  Greville with candour  He thought him a man of rough manners  but not ill natured  He affected to be a joker  and often therefore might be taken for a worse man than he really was  He believed him to be careless of his reputation  and one who seemed to think there were wit and bravery in advancing free and uncommon things  and gloried in bold surprizes  For my part  continued he  I should hardly have consented
