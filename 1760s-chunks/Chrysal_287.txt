disagreeable  and consequently a   removal to another  where a new object attracted their attention   from such reflections  and awoke new hopes  however likely to end   in the same manner as the former  gave them pleasure      There was a decency in the behaviour of both men and oiBcers   in this ship so very different from what I had seen in others  as to   strike me with an agreeable surprise  But I was not long at a loss   for the reason  As soon as the ship was im der sail  the captain   summoned all his officers into the great cabin  and after some   general instructions about their duty â€”   Gentlemen    said he    addressing himself to my master and another  who had been but   lately appointed to his ship    as we have never sailed together   before  I must desire your attention to a few hints  which I always   take the liberty to give in such circumstances  We are now shut   up together in a prison  where the unavoidable inconveniences of   our situation make all our care necessary to prevent its becoming   insupportable to us  For this reason  the first thing I recommend   to you is  not to game  Beside the danger of disagreement when   the passions are agitated by the vicissitudes of play  our pay is   scarce sufficient for our support  so that the least loss must be dis    tressing  the consequence of which must be general unhappiness    for who can see his companion miserable  without sharing in his   misery   There is another thing  against which  though not com    monly considered in this light  I must earnestly caution you  as   inevitably throwing a gloom over that cheerfulness of mind  which   is the greatest happiness of life  and to us must supply the place of   every other happiness  and this is the vice of profane cursing and   swearing  to the reproach of our service  too prevalent among   us         There is no man  however hardened in this detestable habit    but knows it to be a crime  and feels a check from within every   time he is guilty of it  the repetition of which self  accusation sours   his temper  and makes him dissatisfied with himself  and every   person and thing about him  For the truth of this  I appeal to   unvaried experience  Who ever saw a man serenely cheerful    that was addicted to this vice  I might say indeed  to any vice    but as our situation precludes us from the practice of most others    I mention these only into which we may fall    for occasional mirth   is a very different thing  and too often leads into consequences         336 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     destructive of serenity of mind  especially when it is raised by   means inconsistent with virtue        I do not speak of the effect which the practice of virtue has upon   our resolution  The courage of a Briton can never be doubted     but still there is as much difference between that of a virtuous and   a vicious man  as of the same person when sober  or intoxicated   with liquor  The former is uniform  steady  and attentive to   improve every advantage or remedy any misfortune  the other    boisterous  headlong  and blinded with passion   for passion only   can make a man face death  who  in the cool moment of reflection    is afraid to die  In a word  one is the courage of a man  the other    the rashness of a brute  Against these two things  therefore gaming   and swearing  I take the liberty to caution you  as a friend  who is   sincerely desirous of your welfare  But there is another vice  in   respect to which I do not think myself obliged to observe the same   delicacy  and this is drunkenness  which is liable to be attended   with such dangerous consequences in our situation in particular â€”   for I think it unnecessary to mention any other â€” that I shall ever   exert all the authority entrusted to me to suppress it  and therefore   it is but just for me to declare that no officer  who is once guilty   of it under my command  shall ever do duty under me more        This  gentlemen  is wlaat I had to say to you  The observation   of these few hints will make us happy among ourselves  and re    spected by our men  without which it is impossible for us to be   well obeyed by them   for  heedless and profligate as they may   appear  they are the severest
