to explain how much their  fortunes must be advanced by finding means of conquering her resolution   and by the final success of Lord Raymond in obtaining full and  indisputable possession of the lands and dignities of the house of  Salisbury  But Reginhald  conscious that his own security from disgrace  and punishment depended on the influence and protection of this Lord   needed no inducement to concur in the designs and practices of his  brother  He broke in upon his discourse with a passionate heat  and  loudly condemned all his late proceedings   Why   said he         was not I made acquainted with your difficulties  why were not their  hands forcibly joined  I should have at once pronounced the nuptial  benediction over them  and without regard to female pride or scruples   have united them for ever in those bands  which no human power can rend  asunder         —Grey again began to condemn his violence  and to urge the necessity of  caution  when their conference was suddenly interrupted by a domestic   who surprised them by declaring that he sought the Monk  and had in  charge to conduct him to the Countess    The  mind of this unhappy lady had long been violently agitated  the true  cause of that languor and malady which oppressed her gentle frame  The  hopes she had conceived of the safety of her son  and the speedy arrival  of friends and deliverers  had acted on her harassed spirits like a  powerful medicine  and checked the progress of her disorder  She had now  leisure to turn her thoughts to her husband  and to weigh those accounts  of his fate which Oswald had rashly conveyed to her  The idea of his  disloyalty was piercing  she revolved it frequently  she reasoned on  the intelligence she had received  she believed  she doubted  she  indulged her suspicions  and strove to banish them  by turns  Ill were  those reflections suited to restore her impaired health  yet she dwelt  upon them  The faithful Elinor  from whom she could not conceal her  thoughts  in vain endeavoured to compose her distractions  and to allay  her inward grief  still she tormented herself with reflections on the  supposed falsehood of her Lord  and on his unhappy fate  when the  attendant casually discovered from a window the approach of Reginhald   and observed with some surprise that a religious man  who by his habit  seemed of the neighbouring monastery  was now entering the castle         He comes with news of my son         said the Countess hastily       Let him be called hither —And  alas  this distracted breast hath but too  much need of spiritual counsel and comfort         A domestic was instantly dispatched to seek the Monk  who now appeared  before the Countess  Naturally base and mean  and never before admitted  into such a presence  he stood abashed and confused  and the  consciousness of his own vile purposes served to increase his disorder   His aspect  in which the sensual and malignant passions had fixed their  seat  and his deportment  which was that of the rude hind or midnight  brawler  not of the holy and lettered clerk  were surveyed by the  Countess with sudden disgust  She shuddered  as at the view of some  loathsome animal  yet  assuming a placid air  and endeavouring to conceal  her dislike  she asked of his order and residence  No sooner had he  named the brotherhood of Sarum  than raising herself from the couch on  which she leaned   You then  said she         bring me news of my son—dispatched to acquaint me with his safe arrival  within your holy walls—Is it not so         Reginhald coldly answered  that her son was safe  and had been  deposited in the monastery hy his conductor  The Countess  with clasped  hands and earnest accents  uttered a prayer for his protection  Elinor  was tenderly affected  and uniting her fervours with those of her  beloved mistress  commended young William to every saint and holy angel   The Monk stood unmoved  and scarcely could assume the appearance of  devotion  just as far as to pronounce a cold assent to their petitions   The Countess was on the point of imploring his protection for her son   but the disgust which she had conceived at his aspect  and which was  encreased by his demeanour  repressed that thought  She contented  herself with speaking her hopes in general  that his innocence and his  wrongs would not fail to raise him friends in the house of piety and  charity  She spoke of the oppression which she herself had suffered  in  terms of bitterness and indignation  and seemed to demand  as her just  right  the vigorous interposition of every good man for her relief  but  more especially the dutiful and faithful offices of those holy men who  had experienced her favour and munificence
