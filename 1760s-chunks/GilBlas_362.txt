 a young actress of much note for her personal and professional fascinations  it is affirmed that she dances and sings like all the muses and graces put together  and that the whole theatre rings with applause at her performance  to these perfections is added matchless and irresistible beauty  Such a star should only shine within the circle of a court  The king has a taste for the stage  for music  and for dancing  nor must he be debarred from the pleasure of seeing and hearing such a prodigy  I have determined on sending you to Toledo  that you may judge for yourself whether she really is so extraordinary an actress  on your feeling of her merit my measures shall be taken  for I have unlimited confidence in your discernment   I undertook to bring his lordship a good account of this business  and made my arrangements for setting out with one servant  but not in the minister s livery  by way of conducting matters more warily  and that precaution relished well with his excellency  On my arrival at Toledo  I had scarcely alighted at the inn  when the landlord  taking me for some country gentleman  said  Please your honour  you are probably come to be present at the august ceremony of an Auto da FÃ© to morrow  I answered in the affirmative  the more completely to mislead him  and keep my own counsel  You will see  replied he  one of the prettiest processions you ever saw in your life  there are said to be more than a hundred prisoners  and ten of them are to be roasted   In good truth  next morning  before sun rise  I heard all the bells in the town peal merrily  and the design of their bob  majors was to acquaint the people that the pastime was about to begin  Curious to see what sort of a recreation it was  I dressed in a hurry  and posted to the scene of action  All about that quarter  and along the streets where the procession was to pass  were scaffolds  on one of which I purchased a standing  The Dominicans walked first  preceded by the banner of the Inquisition  These Christian fathers were immediately followed by the hapless victims of the holy office  selected for this day s burnt offering  These devoted wretches walked one by one with their head and feet bare  each of them with a taper in his hand  and a fiery  not baptismal godfather by his side  Some had large yellow scapularies  worked with crosses of St Andrew  in red  others wore sugar loaf caps of paper  illustrated with flames  and diabolical figures of all sorts by way of emblem   As I looked narrowly at these objects of religious gaze  with a compassion in my heart which might have been construed criminal  had it run over from my eyes  I fancied that the reverend Father Hilary and his companion brother Ambrose were among those who figured in the sugar loaf caps  They passed too near for me to be deceived  What do I see  thought I inwardly  heaven  wearied out with the wicked lives of these two scoundrels  has given them up to the justice of the Inquisition  My whole frame trembled at the thought  and my spirits were scarcely equal to support me from fainting  My connection with these knaves  the adventure at Xelva  all our pranks in partnership rushed upon my memory  and I did not know how sufficiently to thank God for having preserved me from St Andrew s crosses and the painted devils on the paper caps   When the ceremony was over  I returned to the inn  with my heart sickening at the dreadful sight  but painful impressions soon wear away  and I thought only of my commission and its due accomplishment  I waited with impatience for play time  as the moment and scene of my commencing operations  On the opening of the doors I repaired to the theatre  and took my seat next to a knight of Alcantara  We soon got into chat  Sir  said I  the players here have been represented to me in very favourable terms  may I give credit to general report  The company is not contemptible  replied the knight  they have some first rate performers  among the rest  the peerless Lucretia  an actress of fourteen  who will astonish you  and she plays one of her best parts to night   On the drawing up of the curtain  two actresses came on  with every advantage of dress and stage effect  but neither of them could possibly be the object of my search  At length Lucretia made her appearance at the back scene  and walked forwards amidst a thunder of applause  Ah  this is she  indeed  thought I  and a delicate specimen of loveliness  as I am a sinner  In her very first speech she proved herself a child of nature  with energy and conception far above her years  and the approbation of a provincial audience was confirmed by my metropolitan judgment  The knight was happy to find I liked her  and assured me that if I had heard her sing  my ears might have rejoiced to the sorrow of my heart  Her dancing  too  he represented as not less formidable to the free will
