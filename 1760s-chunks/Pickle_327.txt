 but made up to them in all places of  public resort  with the same ease and familiarity as he had been used  to express  and even re embarked in some of their excesses  upon the  strength of his sanguine expectation  Cadwallader and he renewed  their consultations in the court of ridicule  and divers exploits were  achieved  to the confusion of those who had  sailed into the north of  their displeasure    But these enjoyments were soon interrupted by a misfortune equally fatal  and unexpected  His noble patron was seized with an apoplectic fit  from  which he was recovered by the physicians  that they might despatch him  according to rule  and in two months after they were called  he went the  way of all flesh  Peregrine was very much afflicted at this event  not  only on account of his friendship for the deceased  to whom he thought  himself under many and great obligations  but also because he feared  that his own interest would suffer a severe shock  by the removal of  this nobleman  whom he considered as its chief support  He put himself  therefore in mourning  out of regard to the memory of his departed  friend  and exhibited genuine marks of sorrow and concern  though he  had in reality more cause to grieve than he as yet imagined  When  quarter day came about  he applied to the steward of his lordship s heir  for the interest of his money  as usual  and the reader will readily  own he had some reason to be surprised  when he was told he had no claim  either to principal or interest  True it is  the manager talked very  civilly as well as sensibly on the subject   Your appearance  sir   said  he to Pickle   screens you from all suspicion of an intended fraud  but  the mortgage upon those lands you mention was granted to another person  many years before you pretend to have lent that sum  and I have  this  very morning  paid one quarter s interest  as appears from this receipt   which you may peruse for your satisfaction    Peregrine was so thunderstruck at this information  which stripped him  of his all  that he could not utter one word  a circumstance that did  no great honour to his character in the opinion of the steward  who   in good earnest  began to entertain some doubts of his integrity  For   among the papers of the deceased  which he had examined  there was no  writing  memorandum  or receipt relating to this encumbrance  After a  long pause of stupefaction  Peregrine recollected himself so far as to  observe  that either he was egregiously mistaken  or the predecessor of  his lord the greatest villain upon earth   But  Mr  Whatd ycallum   said  he   you must give me leave to tell you  that your bare assertion in  this affair will by no means induce me to put up quietly with the loss  of ten thousand pounds    Having thus expressed himself  he retired from the house so discontented  at this demur  that he scarce knew whether he moved upon his head or  heels  and the park chancing to be in his way  he sauntered about   giving vent to a soliloquy in praise of his departed friend  the burden    6 22 15  3 45 PM   of which was a string of incoherent curses imprecated upon himself  till  his transports by degrees giving way to his reflection  he deliberated  seriously and sorrowfully upon his misfortune  and resolved to consult  lawyers without loss of time  But  first of all  he proposed to make  personal application to the heir  who  by a candid representation of  the case  might be inclined to do him justice  In consequence of this  determination  he next morning put his writings in his pocket  and went  in a chair to the house of the young nobleman  to whom  being admitted  by virtue of his appearance  and a small gratification to the porter  he  explained the whole affair  corroborating his assertions with the papers  which he produced  and describing the disgrace that would be entailed  upon the memory of the deceased  should he be obliged to seek redress in  a public court of justice   The executor  who was a person of good breeding  condoled him upon his  loss with great good nature  though he did not seem much surprised at  his account of the matter  but wished  that  since the fraud must have  been committed  the damage had fallen upon the first mortgager  who   he said  was a thievish usurer  grown rich by the distresses of his  fellow creatures  In answer to our hero s remonstrances  he observed   that he did not look upon himself as obliged to pay the least regard to  the character of his predecessor  who had used him with great barbarity  and injustice  not only in excluding him from his countenance and  assistance  but also in prejudicing his inheritance as much as lay in
