every day contracting  The greatest part were either taken or laid under contribution  and possessed by his enemies  and he was left without any alliance or assistance  but what the British parliament might think proper to afford   These succours could  at best  have been  for some time  but ineffectual  however  it was resolved by the English ministry  that something should be done  and accordingly an enterprize was planned against the French coast  which  by drawing off their attention from their German enemies  might give the latter   221 kingdom time to respire  and call off a part of the French to the defence of their own  Beside this intention  England also hoped to be able to give a blow to their marine  by destroying such ships as were laid up  or building in the harbour of Rochfort  the city against which this expedition was destined  The English ministry had kept that object of their operations a profound secret  and France was filled with alarms till  at length  it was found that the fleet appeared before Rochfort  where it spent some time in deliberating upon what manner to proceed  At last it was resolved to secure the little island of Aix  an easy conquest  which  while performing  the militia of the country had time to assemble  and there was an appearance of two camps upon the shore  The commanders therefore  who  by the badness of the weather  were  at first  prevented from landing  now feared equal danger from the numbers of the enemy which were to oppose them  They took into consideration the badness of the coast  the danger of landing  the time the city had to prepare for a vigorous defence  and their own unfitness for any other methods to reduce it but that of a sudden attack  This consideration induced them to desist from further operations  and they unanimously resolved to return home  without making any attempt  Nothing could equal the discontent of the English upon seeing this expedition  of which they had conceived such expectations  return unsuccessful  It produced  as usual  a contest between those who planned  and those who were sent to execute it  The military men represented it as useless and rash  the ministers exclaimed at the timidity and delays of those from whose vigour success was to be expected  A Court of Enquiry censured the commander  but a Court Martial acquitted him  This  like almost all the former operations  served to embitter party  and increase despondence  A great man was even heard   222 to say  upon a very solemn occasion  that he believed the commanders of every military operation were resolved upon doing nothing  The tumult of the people was now sunk from turbulent clamour into sullen discontent  they saw only gloomy prospects on every side  their armies destroyed  their fleets unactive  their expeditions ridiculous  and the only ally they had left in Europe  that would fight their battles  upon the point of being overwhelmed by superiority of numbers  Such were the beginnings of this war  from which the timid foreboded national servitude  and a total destruction of all maritime power  and even the most sanguine only hoped for a peace that might restore them to former equality   I am   c   LETTER XXVII   SUCH was the ill success of the English arms  and of their allies  at the beginning of this war  Every day the press  teemed with productions which either reproached their cowardice  or foreboded their undoing  Yet still the hopes of the parliament rose with their disappointments  and every resource seemed to augment with their expences  Tho  the supplies for this destructive and hitherto shameful war  were enormous  yet they were raised as soon as granted  The officers of the army seemed roused into vigour by the national reproaches  Asia  however  was the country in which success first began to dawn upon the British interest  and where we first learned the art of again conquering the enemy  A war in Europe could not be proclaimed between the two great powers  without being felt in the remotest parts of the globe  This immense tract of country  which was the theatre of an Asiatic war  comprehends the   223 whole peninsula of India Proper  On the coasts of this great territory  the English  the French  and several other powers of Europe  had built forts  with the original consent of the Mogul  who claims the sovereignty of the whole Empire  Whatever his right may be to this dominion  his power is scarce felt or acknowledged in many of the remoter provinces  and even the Governors or Nabobs  who were originally of his appointment  have rendered themselves independent  and exert an absolute dominion over their respective territories  without acknowledging his superiority  either by tribute or homage  In the contests of these Princes  therefore  instead of having recourse to the Mogul for redress  they apply to the European powers  whom they can either purchase or persuade to assist them  The war between England and France  in these remote parts  first began by each power s siding with two contending Nabobs  and thus  by degrees  becoming principals in the dispute  The success  on each side  for some time after the treaty of
