not loiter by the way  An old woman in waiting  as my guide  conducted me by a little garden gate into a large house  and left me in an elegant closet  saying    Stay here  I will acquaint my mistress with your arrival  I observed a great many articles of value in the closet  which was magnificently illuminated  but this splendour only caught my attention as confirming me in my previous opinion of the lady s high rank  If appearances strengthened that conjecture  her noble and majestic air on her entrance left no doubt on my mind  Yet I was a little out in my calculation   Noble sir  said she  after the step I have taken in your favour it were impertinent to disown my partiality  Your brilliant actions of to day  in presence of the court  were not the inspirers of my sentiments  they only urge forward this avowal  I have seen you more than once  have inquired into your character  and the result has determined me to follow the impulse of my heart  But do not suppose that you are well with a Duchess  I am but the widow of a captain in the King s Guards  yet there is something to throw a radiance round your victory         the preference you have gained over one of the first noblemen in the kingdom  The Duke d Almeyda loves me  and presses his suit with ardour  yet without success  My vanity only induces me to bear his importunities   Though I saw plainly  by this address  that I had got in with a coquet  my presiding star was not a whit out of my good graces for involving me in this adventure  Donna Hortensia  for that was the lady s name  was just in the ripeness and luxuriance of youth and dazzling beauty  Nay  more  she had refused the possession of her heart to the earnest entreaties of a duke  and offered it unsolicited to me  What a feather in the cap of a Spanish cavalier  I prostrated myself at Hortensia s feet  to thank her for her favours  I talked just as a man of gallantry always does talk  and she had reason to be satisfied with the extravagance of my acknowledgments  Thus we parted the best friends in the world  on the terms of meeting every evening when the Duke d Almeyda was prevented from coming  and  she promised to give me due notice of his absence  The bargain was exactly fulfilled  and I was turned into the Adonis of this new Venus   But the pleasures of this life are transitory  With all the lady s precautions to conceal our private treaty of commerce from my rival  he found means of gaining a knowledge  of which it concerned us greatly to keep him ignorant  a disloyal chamber  maid divulged the state secret  This nobleman  naturally generous  but proud  self sufficient  and violent  was exasperated at my presumption  Anger and jealousy set him beside himself  Taking counsel only with his rage  he resolved on an infamous revenge  One night when I was with Hortensia  he waylaid me at the little garden gate  with all his servants provided with cudgels  As soon as I came out  he ordered me to be seized  and beat to death by these wretches  Lay on  said he  let the rash intruder give up the ghost under your chastisement  thus shall his insolence be punished  No sooner had he finished these words  than his myrmidons assaulted me in a body  and gave me such a beating  as to stretch me senseless on the ground  after which they hurried off with their master  to whom this butchery had been a delicious pastime  I lay the remainder of the night  just as they had left me  At daybreak some people passed by  who  finding that life was still in me  had the humanity to carry me to a surgeon  Fortunately my wounds were not mortal  and  falling into skilful hands  I was perfectly cured in two months  At the end of that period I made my appearance again at court  and resumed my former way of life  except that I steered clear of Hortensia  who on her part made no further attempt to renew the acquaintance  because the Duke  on that condition  had pardoned her infidelity   As my adventure was the town talk  and I was known to be no coward  people were astonished to see me as quiet as if I had received no affront  for I kept my thoughts to myself  and seemed to have no quarrel with any man living  No one knew what to think of my counterfeited insensibility  Some imagined that  in spite of my courage  the rank of the aggressor overawed me  and occasioned my tacit submission  Others  with more reason  mistrusted my silence  and considered my inoffensive demeanour as a cover to my revenge  The King was of opinion with these last  that I was not a man to put up with an insult  and that I should not be wanting to myself at a convenient opportunity  To discover my real intentions  he sent for me one day into his closet  where he said  Don Pompeyo
