gone down  in again  It is truth  Harriet  came the bold wretch  I will not    195 said he  as you are not particularly employed  leave you—Upon my soul  madam  you don t use me well  But if you will oblige me with your company to morrow morning—  No where  Sir—  Only to breakfast with Miss Byron  my dear—As a mark of your obligingness  I request it   His dear —Now I hate a hypocrite  of all things  I knew that he had a design to make a shew of his bride  as his property  at another place  and seeing me angry  thought he would name a visit agreeable to me  and which at the same time would give him a merit with you  and preserve to himself the consequence of being obliged by his obedient wife  at the word of authority   From this foolish beginning arose our mighty quarrel  What vexed me was  the art of the man  and the evident design he had to get you of his side  He  in the course of it  threatened me with appealing to you —To intend to ruin me in the Love of my dearest friend  Who  that valued that friend  could forgive it  You may believe  that if he had not proposed it  and after such accumulated offences  it was the very visit that I should have been delighted with   Indeed  Sir—Upon my word  my Lord—I do assure you  Sir —with a moderate degree of haughtiness—was what the quarrel arose to  on my side—And  at last  to a declaration of rebellion—I won t   On his side  Upon my soul  madam—Let me perish  if—and then hesitating—You use me ill  madam  I have not deserved—And give me leave to say—I insist upon being obliged  madam   There was no bearing of this  Harriet —It was a cool evening  but I took up my fan—Hey day  said I  what language is this —You insist upon it  my Lord —I think I am married  Am I not —And I took my watch  Half an hour after ten on Monday night—the—What day of the month is this —Please   196 the Lord  I will note down this beginning moment of your authoritative demeanour   My dear Lady G   The wretch called me by his own name  perhaps farther to insult me  if I could bear this treatment  it is impossible for me to love you as I do   So it is in Love to me  that you are to put on already all the husband —Jenny   Do you see  my Lord  affecting a whisper how you dash the poor wench  How like a fool she looks at our folly   Remember  Jenny  that to morrow morning you carry my wedding suits to Mrs  Arnold  and tell her  she has forgot the hanging sleeves to the gowns  Let her put them on out of hand   I was proceeding—But he rudely  gravely  and even with an air of scorn  There was no bearing that  you know  admonished me  A little less wit  madam  and a little more discretion  would perhaps better become you   This was too true to be forgiven  You ll say it  Harriet  if I don t  And to come from a man that was not overburdened with either—But I had too great a command of myself to say so  My dependence  my Lord  This I did say  is upon your judgment  That will always be a balance to my wit  and  with the assistance of your reproving Love  will in time teach me discretion   Now  my dear  was not this a high compliment to him  Ought he not to have taken it as such  Especially as I looked grave  and dropt him a very fine courtesy  But either his conscience or his ill nature  perhaps you ll say both  made him take it as a reflexion  True as you are alive  Harriet    He bit his lip  Jenny  begone  said he—Jenny  don t go  said I—Jenny knew not which to obey  Upon my word  Harriet  I began to think the man would have cuff d me —And while he was in his ails of mockmajesty  I stept to the door  and whipt down to my company     197 As married people are not to expose themselves to their friends  who I once heard you sagely remark  would remember disagreeable things  when the honest pair had forgot them  I was determined to be prudent  You would have been charmed with me  my dear  for my discretion  I will cheat by standers  thought I  I will make my Lord and Lady L  Dr  Bartlett  and Emily  whom I had before set in at cards  think we are egregiously happy—And down I sat  intending  with a lamblike peaceableness  to make observations on the play  But soon after  in whipt my indiscreet Lord  his colour heightened  his features working  And tho  I cautioned him not to expose himself  yet he assumed airs that were the occasion  as you shall hear  of frighting away
