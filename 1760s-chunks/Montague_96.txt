    I would say more  but my spirits are so affected  I am incapable of writing       Love my sweet Emily  and let her not repent the generosity of her conduct   Adieu  your affectionate  A  FERMOR     LETTER CLV   155   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   Silleri  June 10  Evening   MY poor Rivers  I think I felt more from his going than even from Emily s  whilst he was here  I seemed not quite to have lost her  I now feel doubly the loss of both       He begged me to shew attention to Madame Des Roches  who he assured me merited my tenderest friendship  he wrote to her  and has left the letter open in my care  it is to thank her  in the most affectionate terms  for her politeness and friendship  as well to himself as to his Emily  and to offer her his best services in England in regard to her estate  part of which some people here have very ungenerously applied for a grant of  on pretence of its not being all settled according to the original conditions        He owned to me  he felt some regret at leaving this amiable woman in Canada  and at the idea of never seeing her more        I love him for this sensibility  and for his delicate attention to one whose disinterested affection for him most certainly deserves it        Fitzgerald is below  he does all possible to console me for the loss of my friends  but indeed  Lucy  I feel their absence most severely       I have an opportunity of sending your brother s letter to Madame Des Roches  which I must not lose  as they are not very frequent   tis by a French gentleman who is now with my father       Adieu  your faithful   A  FERMOR   Twelve at night       We have been talking of your brother  I have been saying  there is nothing I so much admire in him as that tenderness of soul  and almost female sensibility  which is so uncommon in a sex  whose whole education tends to harden their hearts        Fitzgerald admires his spirit  his understanding  his generosity  his courage  the warmth of his friendship       My father his knowledge of the world  not that indiscriminate suspicion of mankind which is falsely so called  but that clearness of mental sight  and discerning faculty  which can distinguish virtue as well as vice  wherever it resides         I also love in him   said my father   that noble sincerity  that integrity of character  which is the foundation of all the virtues         And yet  my dear papa  you would have had Emily prefer to him  that white curd of asses milk  Sir George Clayton  whose highest claim to virtue is the constitutional absence of vice  and who never knew what it was to feel for the sorrows of another         You mistake  Bell  such a preference was impossible  but she was engaged to Sir George  and he had also a fine fortune  Now  in these degenerate days  my dear  people must eat  we have lost all taste for the airy food of romances  when ladies rode behind their enamored knights  dined luxuriously on a banquet of haws  and quenched their thirst at the first stream         But  my dear papa         But  my dear Bell        I saw the sweet old man look angry  so chose to drop the subject  but I do aver  now he is out of sight  that haws and a pillion  with such a noble fellow as your brother  are preferable to ortolans and a coach and six  with such a piece of still life and insipidity as Sir George       Good night  my dear Lucy     LETTER CLVI   156   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   Silleri  June 17   I HAVE this moment received a packet of letters from my dear Lucy  I shall only say  in answer to what makes the greatest part of them  that in a fortnight I hope you will have the pleasure of seeing your brother  who did not hesitate one moment in giving up to Mrs  Rivers s peace of mind  all his pleasing prospects here  and the happiness of being united to the woman he loved        You will not  I hope  my dear  forget his having made such a sacrifice  but I think too highly of you to say more on this subject  You will receive Emily as a friend  as a sister  who merits all your esteem and tenderness  and who has lost all the advantages of fortune  and incurred the censure of the world  by her disinterested attachment to your brother       I am extremely sorry  but not surprized  at what you tell me of poor Lady H—  I knew her intimately  she was sacrificed at eighteen  by the avarice and ambition of her parents  to age  disease
