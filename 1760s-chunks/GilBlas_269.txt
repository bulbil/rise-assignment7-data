a jack in office  my language to every suitor was    Send in a memorial on the subject  My tongue ran so glibly to that tune  that one day I gave my landlord the official answer  when he came to put me in mind of a twelvemonth s rent in arrear  As for my butcher and baker  they spared the trouble of asking for their memorials  by never giving me time to run up a bill  Scipio  who mimicked me so exactly  that only those behind the scenes could distinguish the double from the principal performer  held his head just as high with the poor devils who curried favour with him  as a step of the ladder to my ministerial patronage   There was another foolish trick of mine  of which I do not by any means pretend to make a merit  neither more nor less than the extreme assurance of talking about the first nobility  just as if I had been one of their kidney  Suppose  for example  the Duke of Alva  the Duke of Ossuna  or the Duke of Medina Sidonia were mentioned in conversation  I called them without ceremony  my friend Alva  that good natured fellow Ossuna  or that comical dog Medina Sidonia  In a word  my pride and vanity had swelled to such a height  that my father and mother were no longer among the number of my honoured relatives  Alas  poor understrappers  I never thought of asking whether you had sunk or were swimming in the Asturias  A thought about you never came into my head  The court has all the soporific virtues of Lethe  in the case of poor relations   My family was completely obliterated from the tablets of my memory  when one morning a young man knocked at my door and begged to speak with me for a moment in private  He was shown into my closet  where  without asking him to take a chair  as he seemed to be quite a common fellow  I desired to know abruptly what he wanted  How  Signor Gil Blas  said he  do you not remember me  It was in vain that I perused the lines of his face over and over again  I was obliged to tell him fairly that he had the advantage of me  Why  I am one of your old schoolfellows  replied he  bred and born in Oviedo  Bertrand Muscada  the grocer s son  next door neighbour to your uncle the canon  I recollect you as well as if it was but yesterday  We have played a thousand times together at blind man s buff and prison bars   My youthful recollections  answered I  are very transient and confused  Blind man s buff and prison bars are but childish amusement  The burden of state affairs leaves me little time to ruminate on the trifles of my younger days  I am come to Madrid  said he  to settle accounts with my father s correspondent  I heard talk of you  Folks say that you have  a good berth at court  and are already almost as well off as a Jew broker  I thought I would just call in and say  how d ye do  On my return into the country  your family will jump out of their skins for joy  when they hear how famously you are getting on   It was impossible in decency to avoid asking how my father  my mother  and my uncle stood in the world  but that duty was performed in so gingerly a manner  as to leave the grocer little room to compliment dame Nature on her liberal provision of instinct  He seemed quite shocked at my indifference for such near kindred  and told me bluntly  with his coarse shopman s familiarity  Methinks you might have shown more heartiness and natural feeling for your kinsfolk  Why  you ask after them just as if they were vermin  Your father and mother are still at service  take that in your dish  And the good canon  Gil Perez  eat up with gout  rheumatism  and old age  has one foot in the grave  People should feel as people ought  and seeing that you are in a berth to be a blessing to your poor parents  take a friend s advice  and allow them two hundred pistoles a year  That will be doing a handsome thing  and making them comfortable  and then you may spend the rest upon yourself with a good conscience  Instead of being softened by this family picture  I only resented the officiousness of unasked advice  A more delicate and covert remonstrance might perhaps have made its impression  but so bold a rebuke only hardened my heart  My sulky silence was not lost upon him  so that while he moralized himself out of charity into downright abuse  my choler began to overflow  Nay  then  this is too much  answered I  in a devil of a passion  Get about your business  Master Muscada  and mind your own shop  You are a pretty fellow to preach to me  As if I were to be taught my duty by you  Without further parley I handed the grocer out of my closet by the shoulder  and sent him off to weigh figs and nutmegs at Oviedo   The home strokes he had laid
