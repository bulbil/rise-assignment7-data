 to think the man  whose  ample mind must grasp whatever yonder stars survey   Pray  Mr  Pellet   what is your opinion of that image of the mind s grasping the whole  universe  For my own part  I can t help thinking it the most happy  conception that ever entered my imagination    The painter  who was not such a flaming enthusiast in the cause of  liberty  could not brook the doctor s reflections  which he thought  savoured a little too much of indifference and deficiency in point of  private friendship  and therefore seized the present opportunity of  mortifying his pride  by observing  that the image was  without all  doubt  very grand and magnificent  but that he had been obliged for the  idea to Mr  Bayes in  The Rehearsal   who values himself upon the same  figure  conveyed in these words   But all these clouds  when by the eye  of reason grasp d  etc   Upon any other occasion  the painter would  have triumphed greatly upon this detection  but such was the flutter and  confusion of his spirits  under the apprehension of being retaken  that   without further communication  he retreated to his own room  in order to  resume his own dress  which he hoped would alter his appearance in such  a manner as to baffle all search and examination  while the physician  remained ashamed and abashed  to find himself convinced of bombast by  a person of such contemptible talents  He was offended at this proof  of his memory  and so much enraged at his presumption in exhibiting  it  that he could never forgive his want of reverence  and took every  opportunity of exposing his ignorance and folly in the sequel  Indeed   the ties of private affection were too weak to engage the heart of this  republican  whose zeal for the community had entirely swallowed up  his concern for individuals  He looked upon particular friendship as a  passion unworthy of his ample soul  and was a professed admirer of L   Manlius  Junius Brutus  and those later patriots of the same name   who shut their ears against the cries of nature  and resisted all the  dictates of gratitude and humanity   CHAPTER XLVIII     6 22 15  3 45 PM   Pallet conceives a hearty Contempt for his Fellow traveller  and  attaches himself to Pickle  who  nevertheless  persecutes him with his  mischievous Talent upon the Road to Flanders   In the mean time  his companion  having employed divers pailfuls of  water in cleansing himself from the squalor of jail  submitted his face  to the barber  tinged his eye brows with a sable hue  and  being dressed  in his own clothes  ventured to visit Peregrine  who was still under the  hands of his valet de chambre  and who gave him to understand that his  escape had been connived at  and that the condition of their deliverance  was their departure from Paris in three days   The painter was transported with joy  when he learned that he ran  no risk of being retaken  and  far from repining at the terms of his  enlargement  would have willingly set out on his return to England that  same afternoon  for the Bastille had made such an impression upon him   that he started at the sound of every coach  and turned pale at the  sight of a French soldier  In the fulness of his heart  he complained of  the doctor s indifference  and related what had passed at their meeting  with evident marks of resentment and disrespect  which were not at all  diminished  when Jolter informed him of the physician s behaviour  when he sent for him  to confer about the means of abridging their  confinement  Pickle himself was incensed at his want of bowels  and   perceiving how much he had sank in the opinion of his fellow traveller   resolved to encourage these sentiments of disgust  and occasionally  foment the division to a downright quarrel  which he foresaw would  produce some diversion  and perhaps expose the poet s character in  such a light  as would effectually punish him for his arrogance and  barbarity  With this view  he leveled several satirical jokes at the  doctor s pedantry and want of taste  which had appeared so conspicuous  in the quotation he had got by heart  from ancient authors  in his  affected disdain of the best pictures of the world  which  had he been  endowed with the least share of discernment  he could not have beheld  with such insensibility  and  lastly  in his ridiculous banquet  which  none but an egregious coxcomb  devoid of all elegance and sense  would  have prepared  or presented to rational beings  In a word  our young  gentleman played the artillery of his wit against him with such success   that the painter seemed to wake from a dream  and went home with the  most hearty contempt for the person he had formerly adored   Instead of using the privilege of a friend  to enter his apartment  without ceremony
