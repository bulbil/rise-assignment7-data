when his weak    ness shall put on power  his corruption put on glory  and his mortal   be wholly swallowed up of immortality       Friend  I confess that  for once  you have convinced me  Give me   leave to proceed          CHAPTER XI      SOME time after this  Mr  Fenton privately took Ned into his   closet  and calling him a good boy  and giving him a few shillings to   buy playthings  desired him to give the best history he could re    member of himself and his adventures before he met with Harry      Sir  said Ned  the first thing that I remember of myself is my   going from house to house a begging with my mammy  I dreamed   indeed that I was once in a fine house  and among fine people  but   I don t know where nor when   and so I believe  as I say  it was   only a dream      Do you remember your father  Ned  No  sir  I never had a   father that I know of  My mammy was very cross to me  and   used to take from me all the money and victuals that I begged  and   that was a great deal  for I never let people rest till they gave me   something  And so  sir  as I was saying  my mammy was very cross   to me  and used to half starve me  and gave me a beating for every   hour in the day      Did she teach you your prayers  Ned  No  sir  I believe she had   no prayers to teach me   for she used to swear and scold sadly    And so  sir  as I was telling you  we begged from house to house    sometimes in a town and sometimes in the country  till the day she   ran away from me      How came your mammy to run away from you  Ned  Why  sir    we were begging in your town  and had got some halfpence  and   filled our bag  And so we heard a man shouting behind us  and   my mammy turned and saw him running after her very fast  and so   she threw down her great bag on the ground  and made the best   of her way to the next hedge  and got through it  sir   and so I   never saw any more of her  Then  sir  I fell a crying and roaring   terribly to be left alone  and to have nobody in the world who   would have any thing to say to me   and I wished for my mammy   again  bad as she was to me   and I strove to follow her through   the hedge  but was not able  And so I saw a great house on one   side  and I was very sad when I went to it   and there it was that   I met my own young master  and he put clothes upon me with his   own dear hands  and he took me to himself  and he is ever since so   kind to me that it troubles me very much   for I can do nothing at   all for him  you know  sir  and that grieves me more than all the   world      Well  Neddy  says Mr  Fenton  do not cry  my child  Be a good         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  147     boy and mind your book  and be sure you tell no lies  nor do   mischief to any body   and I will take care of you  and be a father   to you myself  But tell me  Ned  would you know the woman you   call your mammy  if you should see her again   Yes  yes  sir   cried   Ned  There was not a day of my life but she gave me reason to   remember her   I should know her from all the world  if I was not   to see the face of her for a hundred years to come      I find  Ned  you are not over fond of your mammy  No  indeed    sir  answered Ned  I love Master Harry s little finger  and I would   love yourself if I dared  sir  better than a thousand such mammies   as mine was   and that  I suppose  is very naughty   for all good   children  they say  love their fathers and mothers  Well  Ned  says   Mr  Fenton  if you happen at any time to see her among the great   numbers of beggars that come to our door
