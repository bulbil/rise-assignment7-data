would have thrown overboard  as a traitor who had betrayed them to their enemies  but others more considerate  alledged  that if they put me to death  and should afterwards be   40 taken  they could expect no mercy from the legislature  which would never pardon outlawry aggravated by murder —It was therefore determined by a plurality of votes  that I should be set on shore in France  and left to find my passage back to England  as I should think proper  which would be punishment sufficient for the bare suspicion of a crime in itself not capital —Although this favourable determination gave me great pleasure  the apprehension of being robbed would not suffer me to be perfectly at ease  To prevent this calamity  as soon as I was untied  in consequence of the foresaid decision  I tore a small hole in one of my stockings  into which I dropped six guineas  reserving half a piece and some silver in my pocket  that finding something  they might not be tempted to make any further inquiry —This was a very necessary precaution  for when we came within sight of the French shore  one of the smugglers told me  I must pay for my passage —To this I replied  that my passage was none of my own seeking  therefore they could not expect a reward from me for transporting me into a strange country by force —   Damme   said the outlaw  none of your palaver  but let me see what money you have got  —  So saying  he thrust his hand into my pocket without any ceremony  and emptied it of the contents  Then casting an eye at my hat and wig  which captivated his fancy  he took them off  and clapping his own on my head  declared  that a fair exchange was no robbery —I was fain to put up with the bargain  which was by no means favourable to me  and a little while after we went all on shore together       41 I resolved to take my leave of these desperadoes  without much ceremony  when one of them cautioned me against appearing to their prejudice if ever I returned to England  unless I had a mind to be murdered  for which service  he assured me  the gang never wanted agents —I promised to observe his advice  and departed for the Upper Town  where I enquired for a cabaret or publick house  into which I went  with an intention of taking some refreshment —In the kitchin  five Dutch sailors sat at breakfast  with a large loaf  a sirkin of butter  and a cag of brandy on the table  the bung of which they often applied to their mouths with great perseverance and satisfaction —At some distance from them  I perceived another person in the same garb  sitting in a pensive solitary manner  entertaining himself with a whiff of tobacco  from the stump of a pipe  as black as jet —The appearance of distress never failed to attract my regard and compassion  I approached this forlorn tar  with a view to offer him my assistance  and notwithstanding the alteration of dress  and disguise of a long beard  I discovered in him my long lost and lamented uncle and benefactor  lieutenant Bowling  Good heaven  what were the agitations of my soul  between the joy of finding again such a valuable friend  and the sorrow of seeing him in such a low condition  The tears gushed down my cheeks  I stood motionless and silent for some time  at length  recovering the use of speech  exclaimed     Gracious God  Mr  Bowling  —  My uncle no sooner heard his name mentioned  than he started up  crying with some surprize    Holloa    and after having looked at me stedfastly  without being able   42 to recollect me  said    Did you call me  brother    I told him  I had something extraordinary to communicate  and desired him to give me a few minutes hearing in another room  but he would by no means consent to this proposal  saying    Avast there  friend  none of your tricks upon travellers —if you have any thing to say to me  do it above board —you need not be afraid of being over heard —here are none who understand our lingo  —  Though I was loath to discover myself before company  I could no longer refrain from telling him  I was his own nephew Roderick Random  On this information  he considered me with great earnestness and astonishment  and recalling my features  which though enlarged were not entirely altered since he had seen me  came up and shook me by the hand very cordially  protesting he was glad to see me well  After some pause  he went on thus    And yet  my lad  I am sorry to see you under such colours  the more so  as it is not in my power  at present  to change them for the better  times being very hard with me    With these words I could perceive a tear trickle down his surrowed cheeks  which affected me so much  that I wept bitterly —Imagining my sorrow was the effect of my own misfortunes  he comforted me
