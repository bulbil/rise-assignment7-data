believe  when we hear he is coming  it will be best to make use of   the key  which I shall soon procure you  and I can borrow a horse for   you  I believe  to wait within half a mile of the back door  over   the pasture  and will contrive  by myself  or somebody  to have you   conducted some miles distant  to one of the villages thereabouts  so   don t be discomforted  I beseech you  I am  excellent Mrs  Pamela                                                   Your faithful friend  etc           I made a thousand sad reflections upon the former part of this honest   gentleman s kind letter  and but for the hope he gave me at last  should   have given up my case as quite desperate  I then wrote to thank him most   gratefully for his kind endeavours  to lament the little concern the   gentry had for my deplorable case  the wickedness of the world  first   to give way to such iniquitous fashions  and then plead the frequency of   them  against the attempt to amend them  and how unaffected people were   with the distresses of others  I recalled my former hint as to writing   to Lady Davers  which I feared  I said  would only serve to apprise her   brother  that she knew his wicked scheme  and more harden him in it  and   make him come down the sooner  and to be the more determined on my   ruin  besides that it might make Mr  Williams guessed at  as a means   of conveying my letter  And being very fearful  that if that good lady   would interest herself in my behalf   which was a doubt  because she   both loved and feared her brother   it would have no effect upon him    and that therefore I would wait the happy event I might hope for from   his kind assistance in the key  and the horse  I intimated my master s   letter  begging to be permitted to come down  was fearful it might be   sudden  and that I was of opinion no time was to be lost  for we might   let slip all our opportunities  telling him the money trick of this vile   woman  etc       I had not time to take a copy of this letter  I was so watched  And when   I had it ready in my bosom  I was easy  And so I went to seek out Mrs    Jewkes  and told her  I would have her advice upon the letter I had   received from my master  which point of confidence in her pleased her   not a little  Ay  said she  now this is something like  and we ll take a   turn in the garden  or where you please  I pretended it was indifferent   to me  and so we walked into the garden  I began to talk to her of the   letter  but was far from acquainting her with all the contents  only   that he wanted my consent to come down  and hoped she used me kindly    and the like  And I said  Now  Mrs  Jewkes  let me have your advice as   to this  Why then  said she  I will give it you freely  E en send to him   to come down  It will highly oblige him  and I dare say you ll fare the   better for it  How the better  said I   I dare say  you think yourself    that he intends my ruin  I hate  said she  that foolish word  your   ruin   Why  ne er a lady in the land may live happier than you if you   will  or be more honourably used       Well  Mrs  Jewkes  said I  I shall not  at this time  dispute with you   about the words ruin and honourable  for I find we have quite different   notions of both  But now I will speak plainer than ever I did  Do you   think he intends to make proposals to me as to a kept mistress  or kept   slave rather  or do you not   Why  lambkin  said she  what dost thou   think thyself   I fear  said I  he does  Well  said she  but if he does     for I know nothing of the matter  I assure you   you may have your own   terms  I see that  for you may do any thing with him       I could not bear this
