  Silleri  Thursday morning   I DARE say  my dear  Madame Des Roches has not heard from Rivers  but suppose she had  If he loves you  of what consequence is it to whom he writes  I would not for the world any friend of yours should ask her such a question       I shall call upon you at six o clock  and shall expect to find you determined to go to the governor s this evening  and to dance  Fitzgerald begs the honor of being your partner       Believe me  Emily  these kind of unmeaning sacrifices are childish  your heart is new to love  and you have all the romance of a girl  Rivers would  on your account  be hurt to hear you had refused to dance in his absence  though he might be flattered to know you had for a moment entertained such an idea       I pardon you for having the romantic fancies of seventeen  provided you correct them with the good sense of four and twenty       Adieu  I have engaged myself to Colonel H—  on the presumption that you are too polite to refuse to dance with Fitzgerald  and too prudent to refuse to dance at all   Your affectionate  A  FERMOR     LETTER CXXII   122   To Miss FERMOR  at Silleri   Quebec  Saturday morning   HOW unjust have I been in my hatred of Madame Des Roches  she spent yesterday with us  and after dinner desired to converse with me an hour in my apartment  where she opened to me all her heart on the subject of her love for Rivers       She is the noblest and most amiable of women  and I have been in regard to her the most capricious and unjust  my hatred of her was unworthy my character  I blush to own the meanness of my sentiments  whilst I admire the generosity of hers       Why  my dear  should I have hated her  she was unhappy  and deserved rather my compassion  I had deprived her of all hope of being beloved  it was too much to wish to deprive her also of his conversation  I knew myself the only object of Rivers s love  why then should I have envied her his friendship  she had the strongest reason to hate me  but I should have loved and pitied her       Can there be a misfortune equal to that of loving Rivers without hope of a return  Yet she has not only born this misfortune without complaint  but has been the confidante of his passion for another  he owned to her all his tenderness for me  and drew a picture of me   which  she told me  ought  had she listened to reason  to have destroyed even the shadow of hope  but that love  ever ready to flatter and deceive  had betrayed her into the weakness of supposing it possible I might refuse him  and that gratitude might  in that case  touch his heart with tenderness for one who loved him with the most pure and disinterested affection  that her journey to Quebec had removed the veil love had placed between her and truth  that she was now convinced the faint hope she had encouraged was madness  and that our souls were formed for each other       She owned she still loved him with the most lively affection  yet assured me  since she was not allowed to make the most amiable of mankind happy herself  she wished him to be so with the woman on earth she thought most worthy of him       She added  that she had on first seeing me  though she thought me worthy his heart  felt an impulse of dislike which she was ashamed to own  even now that reason and reflexion had conquered so unworthy a sentiment  that Rivers s complaisance had a little dissipated her chagrin  and enabled her to behave to me in the manner she did  that she had  however  almost hated me at the ball in the country  that the tenderness in Rivers s eyes that day whenever they met mine  and his comparative inattention to her  had wounded her to the soul       That this preference had  however  been salutary  though painful  since it had determined her to conquer a passion  which could only make her life wretched if it continued  that  as the first step to this conquest  she had resolved to see him no more  that she would return to her house the moment she could cross the river with safety  and conjured me  for her sake  to persuade him to give up all thoughts of a settlement near her  that she could not answer for her own heart if she continued to see him  that she believed in love there was no safety but in flight       That his absence had given her time to think coolly  and that she now saw so strongly the amiableness of my character  and was so convinced of my perfect tenderness for him  that she should hate herself were she capable of wishing to interrupt our happiness       That she hoped I would pardon her retaining a tender remembrance of a man who  had he never seen me  might have returned her
