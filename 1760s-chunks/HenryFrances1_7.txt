 Samuel Wynne  Mrs  Rose Whitwell  Mrs  Ellen  Whitwell  Mrs  Anne Watson  Miss Hannah Wybrants  Miss Whitmore     unnumbered   A SERIES of LETTERS BETWEEN HENRY and FRANCES   LETTER I  FRANCES to HENRY    THOUGH I have not any Thing to say  which can amuse you  yet I could not think of sending you the inclosed Pamphlet under a blank Cover  as a silent Remembrance is worse than none   I return d to Conduit Street the Evening you left us  but found it was not the same Place     2In short  as Pope says  the Sensation is like that of a Limb lopt off  which one is every Minute unawares applying to Use  but finds it is not   The Tune of Delia sounded in my Ears all Night  and I could have sat by  for the first Time  with Patience  while you play d Alberti s twelve Concerto s  to have had you back again  for the Remainder of the Evening   Now let me shift the Scene  and behold you galloping away  delighted with the certain Prospect of giving as much Joy to those Friends you go to  as you have left Concern with those you parted from  At this Thought I begin to hate you and myself  for being one Moment uneasy about a Man  who perhaps hardly remembers me enough  to forget me  I am so mortified at this  that I am angry at myself for having ever thought of you  but as a common Acquaintance  if indeed your Merit or particular Behaviour to me would have suffered me to remain in such a State of Indifference  These Thoughts  however  do not proceed from any slight Opinion I have of your Sincerity  but a mortal Apprehension that neither my Sense or Merits can purchase your Esteem  without which your Love would shock me   I am running on too far  mais il y à quelque chose de dans qui m entraine  So I shall conclude with some Lines of Cowley tho  you call him a surfeiting Author      3  Each Day think on me  and each Day I shall  For thee make Hours canonical   By every Wind that comes this Way   Send me  at least  a Sigh or two   Such and so many I ll repay   As shall themselves make Winds to get to you     I know you will laugh as you did at Tom s Correspondent for tagging her Letters  but consider  I want a Poet s Help to speak to you  though I need none to think of you   Frances   LETTER II  HENRY to FRANCES   Ma Chere Mignonne   QUELLE foule des affaires m accable — I thought to have wrote this Letter in French  but you are too nice a Critick for me  Only imagine to yourself a Person  who has  every Day of his Life  as much Business to do  as can be well compassed in twenty four Hours  to have three Months Affairs come upon him at once  One  who could scarce spare Time from the Hurry of Business in Town for Love and Alberti  to be confronted with such an Embarras du Monde —Without your sprightly Conversation  or my Twelve Concerto s  to support my Spirits     4Your very agreeable Letter I confess to have more than have repaid me for Alberti  giving me Sense for Sound  but nothing you can say  or any one else can do  will make me Amends for the Want of your Company  if you would be as kind when present  as you express yourself in Absence  but  as I have good Reason to think you Coquette in this Matter  I swear it is a most cruel Treatment  to give me Hopes  which you have not Generosity or Courage to fulfil  This is disingenuous Behaviour  and very unkind too  for I am of too sanguine a Constitution to bear Disappointments with Indifference  and  tho  I can fast a Day upon a  in Epictetus  yet I could not live one Night upon all the Volumes of Plato   Henry   LETTER III  FRANCES to HENRY   THE only Consolation I had in the Midst of my Anxiety for your leaving Town  was the pleasing Hope of an agreeable Correspondent  but I find you design to rob me of that too  for you seem inclined to misconstrue the Sentiments of an Heart  touched with the most lively Esteem  for the Effects of a Coquette Humour     5Will you not suffer me to think of you  but in an hostile Way —Are you afraid I should love you too well  that you thus make it my Duty to hate you  I ought indeed to endeavour it at least  to make a suitable Return for the Sentiments you seem to have towards me   As to your Hurry of Business  I wish I could share or alleviate that  or any Thing else  which makes you uneasy  but this  like most of my Wishes  is fruitless  And I am poor  even in Thanks  for your obliging Compliment  but I dare say  that some new Acquaintance will soon make you ample Amends for
