the adventure of Jerome de Moyadas  and on this single specimen of my parts  they conceived my genius of so high an order  as to elect me by common con sent for their leader  Their choice was fully justified by a host of slippery devices  of which I was the master wheel  the corner stone  or according to whatever other metaphor in mechanics you may best express the soul of a conspiracy  When we had occasion for a female performer to heighten the interest  Camilla was sent upon the stage  and played up to admiration in the parts she had to perform   Just at that period  our friend and brother Ambrose was seized with a longing to see his native country once more  He went for Galicia with an assurance that we might reckon on his return  The visit cured his patriotic sickness  As he was on the road back  having halted at Burgos to strike some stroke of business  an innkeeper of his acquaintance introduced him into the service of Signor Gil Blas de Santillane  not forgetting to instruct him thoroughly in the state of that gentleman s affairs  Signor Gil Blas  pursued Don Raphael  addressing his discourse to me  you know in what manner we eased you of your moveables in a ready  furnished lodging at Valladolid  and you must doubtless have suspected Ambrose to have been the principal contriver of that exploit  and not without reason  On his coming into town  he ran himself out of breath to find us  and laid open every particular of your situation  so that the associated swindlers had nothing to do but to build on his foundation  But you are unacquainted with the consequences of that adventure  you shall therefore have them on my authority  Your portmanteau was made free with by Ambrose and myself  We also took the liberty of riding your mules in the direction of Madrid  not dropping the least hint to Camilla nor to our partners in iniquity  who must have partaken in some measure of your feelings in the morning  at finding their glory shorn of two such beams   On the second day we changed our purpose  Instead of going to Madrid  whence I had not sallied forth without an urgent motive  we passed by Zebreros  and continued our journey as far as Toledo  Our first care  in that town  was to dress ourselves in the genteelest style  then assuming the character of two brothers from Galicia on our travels of mere curiosity  we soon got acquainted in the most respectable circles  I was so much in the habit of acting the man of fashion  as not easily to be detected  and as the generality of people are blinded by a free expenditure  we threw dust into the eyes of all the world  by the elegant entertainments to which we invited the ladies  Among the women who frequented our parties  there was one not indifferent to me  She appeared more beautiful than Camilla  and certainly much younger  I inquired who she was  and learned that her name was Violante  and that she was married to an ungrateful spark  who soon grew weary of her chaste caresses  and was running after those of a prostitute  with whom he was in love  There was no need to say any more  to determine me on enthroning Violante the sovereign lady and mistress of my thoughts and affections   She was not long in coming to the knowledge of her conquest  I began by following her about from place to place  and playing a hundred monkey tricks to instil into her comprehension  that nothing would please me better than the office of making her amends for the ill usage of her husband  The pretty creature ruminated on my proffered kindness  and to such purpose as to let me know in the end that my labour was not wasted on an ungrateful soil  I received a note from her in answer to several I had transmitted by one of those convenient old dowagers  in such high request throughout Spain and Italy  The lady sent me word that her husband supped with his mistress every evening  and did not return home till very late  It was impossible to mistake the meaning of this  On that very night I planted myself under Violante s windows  and engaged her in a most tender conversation  At the moment of parting  it was settled between us that every evening  at the same hour  we should meet and converse on the same everlasting topic  without gainsaying any such other acts of gallantry as might safely be submitted to the peering eye of day   Hitherto Don Balthazar  as Violante s husband was called  had no reason to complain of his forehead  but I was a natural philosopher  and little satisfied with metaphysical endearments  One evening  therefore  I repaired under my lady s windows  with the design of telling her that there was an end of life and everything  if we could not come together on more accommodating terms than from the balcony to the street  for I had never yet been able to get into the house  Just as I got thither  a man came within sight  apparently with the view of dogging me  In fact  it was the husband returning earlier than usual from his precious bit of amusement  but observing a male nuisance near his
