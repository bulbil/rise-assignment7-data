 Since we have conducted Mrs  Llwhyddwhuydd so far  we ll let her rest a little after her journey  and take a trip to London  to inquire what became of her husband     The DREAMING SCENE   David returned home the next morning about two hours after his unfaithful lady s elopement  but too much filled with his evening s excess  to admit of any information  until snoring had evaporated some of those fumes—but the physical account of SNORING  which was never before attempted  is proper to introduce here     To the Sapientifical  Scientifical  Celestial Magazine maker  self taught Philosopher  Lecturer and Instrument seller     To the Venerable Antigallicanist and Balsam of Life vender     To the most celebrated  most advertised  most graduated Ludgate hill Licentiate     And last  though not least in character  To the Egregious  consummate Doctor of all Doctoribuses  the Eccentrical  Occulistical  most superlative Egotist  Adventurer  and Chevalier  this Elaborate Essay is addressed     Page  65  SNORING arises from the superabundancy of vapour  collected the preceding night  by drink and conversation  treasured up in the store house  or magazine of the head     The spirit of the liquor sublimates through the valves  and ducts  from the stomach  and the froth  or Aerial parts of disputes  observations  altercations and witticisms  make their way  thro  the auricular glands or organs  at the same time  into the cellulae of the brain  These puff balls  thus collected  float about  until secretion  I beg  my friends of the faculty  you ll observe this  although it is out of the power of the College to account for animal secretion  ergo  all physick is upon undetermined principles  Yet I have assigned a ratio for the secretory officinal of dreams  which are these puff balls  composed as before mentioned  and lodged in the tenements of the pineal glands  just as infant maggots are housed     But when all the pia and dura mater apartments are filled  and not a single idea  even for the good of self  can be wedged in  there will remain great quantities of this windy effluvia  which the owner of the head has imbibed in the last day and night s exercise  which must be discharged  charged  before the proper disposed imaginations can have room to act     Therefore on a sudden  fast issue through those wind gates the nostrils  the overplus of yesterday s retailings  which can t be performed  before sleep has  for some hours  set his draining engines at work  and that is the reason  why morning dreams are more to be relied upon  than those before midnight  The violence with which this stream rushes forth  from the  Page  66  head  is the occasion of that sound  which is equal to the diameter of the diapason of—but the solution of that question  concerning the mathematical proportion of major and minor semi tones  betwixt snoring and other eructations  is sent for a prize answer to the Lady s Diary  to which we refer the reader     After David had slept about five hours  loud and sound  the elastic coats of his brain began to exert their pulsations  and he dreamed a dream which forboded mischief  as plain as any dream  ever repeated at breakfast  by the politest  prettiest  and most sensible maid  wife  widow or mistress  you enjoyed a morning s tête a tête with  or at least  that you said you did     David did dream  as how  that the Tower of London was made of papier machée  and that the French intended to undermine all our coalpits  and so destroy the nursery of our seamen     Out of the seven or eight millions of Great Britain s inhabitants  one million we may reasonably suppose will read this book  and that 900 000 of those readers  delight in the interpretation of dreams  for their emolument  we shall explain this dream  viz  The Tower of London  being made of chewed paper  signified  that the affection of his wife  which he thought permanent  as the bulwarks which the mud and grass of tower ditch semicirculates  was as insubstantial  as the incoherent ornaments of waste paper  and the French  and the coal pits meant  that a wicked enemy  should undermine the navigation to his wife s heart     At noon  next day  David waked  and with broad eyes found —but by all rules of writing  an author  as well as a painter  is to  Page  67  allow his customers imagination  fair play  or game law  therefore this part of the scene shall be left to the reader s conception  How Mr  Llwhyddwhuydd looked  where he looked  what he said  when he could speak  and how long it was  before he returned to a capability of saying  or seeing  or doing any thing     Suppose yourself  oh sympathizing reader  in this afflicted husband s situation  it is with some confusion  that the Editor acknowledges himself
