  the good government of men  even with the divine decalogue     are no other than faint transcripts of that eternal LAW OF BE    NEVOLENCE which was written and again retraced in the bosom   of the first man  and which all his posterity ought to observe   without further obligation      The capital apostle  St  Paul  bears testimony also to the impres    sion of this law of rights on the consciences and hearts of all men    where he says  in the second chapter of his epistle to the Komans      Not the hearers of the law are just before God  but the doers of   the law shall be justified  For when the Gentiles  which have not   the law  do by nature the things contained in the law  these    having not the law  are a law unto themselves   which shows the   work of the law written in their hearts  their consciences also   bearing witness  and their thoughts  the meanwhile  accusing or   else excusing one another       But  sir  interrupted Harry  I am quite astonished at the   falling off of the father of mankind  So infinitely benefited and   obliged as he was  so necessarily dependent also on his omnipotent   benefactor   how foolish  how base  how ungrateful  how unpardon    able  as I think  was his wonderful apostasy   Wretched creatures   that we are  no sound branch  to be sure  could ever spring   from so debased  so cankered a stock      Let us not be prone to judge of others  my Harry  I am con    fident  as I am of my being  that had you or I been in the case   and place of Adam  we should have fallen in like manner  He   had an old and a very subtile adversary to deal with  He felt   himself powerful  glorious  and happy  He had no notion that   his present state could change for the worse  He was yet a   novice in existence  He could form no conception of the depravity    pains  and mortality that afterward ensued  And he was strongly         264 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      tempted by sensual objects from without  and by the emotions of   his creaturely nature within him  But of this I am assured  Harry    that  if he was the greatest sinner  he was also the greatest and   most contrite penitent that ever existed  as the comparison of   his first with his latter state must have given him the most   poignant and bitter compunctions  and must have caused him  with   tenfold energy  to cling to that Kock from which he was hewn  but   from whence he had fallen      I have already shown you  Harry  that every man has a right in   his person and property   and that his right is natural  inheritable    and indefeasible  No consent of parties  no institution  can make   any change in this great and fundamental law of right   it is uni    versal  invariable  and inalienable  to any men or system of men    It is only defeasible in particular cases   as where one man  by   assailing the safety of another  justly forfeits the title which he had   to his own safety      If human nature had never fallen into a state of inordinate appe    tence  all laws and legal restraints would have been as needless and   impertinent  as the study and practice of physic in a country   exempted from mortality and disease  But  forasmuch as all   men are tyrants by nature  all prone to covet and grasp at the   rights of others  the great LAW OP SAFETY TO ALL can no other    wise be assured  than by THE RESTRAINT OP EACH PROM DOING     INJURY TO ANY      On this lamentable occasion  on this sad necessity of man s calling   for help against man  is founded every intention and end of civil   government  All laws that do not branch from this stem are   cankered or rotten  All political edifices that are not built and   sustained upon this foundation   of defending the weak against   the oppressor   must tumble into a tyranny even worse than   that anarchy which is called the state of nature  where individuals   are unconnected by any social band  But if such a system could   be framed  whereby wrong should not be permitted or dispensed   within any man  right would consequently ensue  and be enjoyed   by all men  and this would be the perfection of CIVIL LIBERTY      Sir  says Harry  I have heard some
