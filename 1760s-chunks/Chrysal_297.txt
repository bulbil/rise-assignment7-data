the same   kind  my stay being always shortest in the best hands  My con    tinuance  though from another motive  was not much longer with   my next master  the merchant  who  in the common course of   soliciting permission for a ship of his to sail with a cargo that must   be ruined by delay  an embargo having been laid on all the shipping   in the place  in the unfathomable wisdom of the ruling powers  to   promote some unintelligible plan of service  gave me to the general s   clerk  from whom  in the same course of business  I came into the   service of the general          CHAPTER V     CHBYSAL s master makes some CHABACTEEISTIC KEFLECTIOjrS â€”   HE IS STJKPRISED AT THE OEFICEr S REFUSING TO MAKE UP MATTERS    AND GIVES A PARTICULAR REASON FOE SOME PEOPLE S RISING IN   THE WORLD â€” AN EXTRAORDINARY PERSONAGE ENTERS TO HIM â€”   DESCRIPTION OP HIM â€” HE GIVES A CHAEACTEE OE THE NATIVE   AMERICANS  AND OFFERS SOME INTERESTING REMARKS ON THE   RETURN THEY MAKE TO THE TREATMENT THEY MEET WITH  AND   ON THE PRACTICE OF FORMING IN THE CLOSET PLANS OF OPERA    TIONS FOR ARMIES IN THE FIELD â€” ODD REASONS WHY THE AMERI    CANS ARE DESIROUS OF GOLD â€” CHRYSAL CHANGES HIS SERVICE     When I entered into the possession of my new master  he was   waiting in his tent  with the most anxious impatience  for the   return of a person whom he had employed to mediate  as of him    self  between him and the officer  whose presumption  in daring to         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 34Â»     find fault with his measures  lie had thought proper to punish in   the manner I juat now mentioned      His reflections on an affair that struck so dangerously at his   pride and avarice  the ruling passions of his heart  could not be   very agreeable  but the sight of the money gave them a pleasing   turn  Having asked the clerk a few questions in the way of busi    ness  and dismissed him  he took the purse  and weighing it in his   hand â€”   Ay    said he  with delight glistening in his eyes    this will   do  This embargo was a lucky thought  Let who will complain   of the hindrance it is to the business of the public  it advances mine    and that is all I care for  I came here to serve myself  and not the   public  and as there is neither plunder nor contributions to be got   by activity  I must try what I can do another way  I showed   my dexterity at hunting savages in the mountains of my own   country  and have no desire to renew the chase here  It was neces    sary for me then to do something that should make me remarkable    and gain favour with those who I saw must prevail in the end  and    therefore I spared no trouble or fatigue  neither friend nor foe    to convince them of my attachment   and in reward  they have now   given me this command  in conducting which  I must use delay to   reap the advantages of my former activity  Fabius saved Rome   by delay   let me but make my fortune by it  and I envy not his   fame  I prefer this sound    chinking the purse    to the empty   noise of public acclamation  the shouts of a giddy mob  who bless   and curse with the same breath  and without knowing why they do   either  No  no  this is music that charms my ear        His meditations were broken off here by the gentleman he waited   for  who informed him that the officer would come to no terms of   accommodation  nor even accept of his liberty tiU he should be   acquitted by a court martial  and have justice done him for the   affront offered to his honour  Such an account was far from being   agreeable to my master  who  for obvious reasons  wished to have   everything to go as quietly as possible  After some pause â€”   This   is a damned affair    said he    but we must now e en make the best   we can of it  Who could have thought that a countryman of my   own would have proved so refractory   We have always been   remarkable for hanging well together  One and all  was the word    or we could never have done such great matters  If it is once   found out that we can be divided  we shall soon lose our conse    quence  and
