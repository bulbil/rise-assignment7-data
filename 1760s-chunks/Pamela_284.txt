me  he treated her in such a manner as made my heart   ache for her  But part was art  I know  to make me think the better of   her       Indeed  sister  said he  there was very little of that  for  at that   time  I cared not what you thought  nor had complaisance enough to have   given a shilling for your good or bad opinion of her or me  And  I   own  I was displeased to be broken in upon  after your provocations    by either of you and she must learn that lesson  never to come near me    when I am in those humours  which shall be as little as possible  For    after a while  if let alone  I always come to myself  and am sorry for   the violence of a temper  so like my dear sister s here  And  for   this reason think it is no matter how few witnesses I have of its   intemperance  while it lasts  especially since every witness  whether   they merit it or not  as you see in my Pamela s case  must be a sufferer   by it  if  unsent for  they come in my way       He repeated the same lesson to me again  and enforced it and owned  that   he was angry with me in earnest  just then  though more with himself    afterwards  for being so  But when  Pamela  said he  you wanted to   transfer all my displeasure upon yourself  it was so much braving me   with your merit  as if I must soon end my anger  if placed there  or   it was making it so light to you  that I was truly displeased  for    continued he  I cannot bear that you should wish  on any occasion   whatever  to have me angry with you  or not to value my displeasure as   the heaviest misfortune that could befall you       But  sir  said I  you know  that what I did was to try to reconcile my   lady  and  as she herself observed  it was paying her a high regard  It   was so  replied he  but never think of making a compliment to her  or   any body living  at my expense  Besides  she had behaved herself so   intolerably  that I began to think you had stooped too much  and more   than I ought to permit my wife to do  and acts of meanness are what I   can t endure in any body  but especially where I love  and as she had   been guilty of a very signal one  I had much rather have renounced her   at that time  than have been reconciled to her       Sir  said I  I hope I shall always comport myself so  as not wilfully   to disoblige you for the future  and the rather do I hope this  as I   am sure I shall want only to know your pleasure to obey it  But this   instance shews me  that I may much offend  without designing it in the   least       Now  Pamela  replied he  don t be too serious  I hope I shan t be a very   tyrannical husband to you  Yet do I not pretend to be perfect  or to   be always governed by reason in my first transports  and I expect  from   your affection  that you will bear with me when you find me wrong  I   have no ungrateful spirit  and can  when cool  enter as impartially   into myself as most men  and then I am always kind and acknowledging  in   proportion as I have been out of the way       But to convince you  my dear  continued he  of your fault   I mean  with   regard to the impetuosity of my temper  for there was no fault in your   intention  that I acknowledge   I ll observe only  that you met  when   you came to me  while I was so out of humour  a reception you did not   expect  and a harsh word or two that you did not deserve  Now  had you   not broken in upon me while my anger lasted  but staid till I had come   to you  or sent to desire your company  you d have seen none of this    but that affectionate behaviour  which I doubt not you ll always merit    and I shall always take pleasure in expressing  and in this temper shall   you always find a proper influence over me  But you must not suppose    whenever I am out of humour  that  in opposing yourself to my passion    you oppose a proper butt to it
