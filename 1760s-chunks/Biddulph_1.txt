  MEMOIRS OF MISS SIDNEY BIDULPH  Extracted from her own Journal  and now first published  FRANCES SHERIDAN    The Editor of the following sheets takes this opportunity of paying the tribute due to exemplary Goodness and distinguished Genius  when found united in One Person  by inscribing these Memoirs to  The AUTHOR OF CLARISSA AND Sir Charles Grandison    CONTENTS  Volume I    1  The Editor’s Introduction    3  Memoirs of Miss Sidney Bidulph    9  The Journal    11   Volume II     141   Volume III    287   Cecilia’s Narrative  c  being a Supplement to Mrs  Arnold’s Journal    423     VOLUME I      THE EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION  I was invited to pass a month last summer in Buckinghamshire by a friend  who paid annually a visit to his mother  a lady pretty far advanced in years  but extremely chearful  sensible  and well bred   She lived altogether in the country  in a good old fashioned house  which was part of her jointure  and it was to this hospitable mansion he carried me   The lady received me very politely  as her son’s friend  and I have great reason to be obliged to him for the introduction   My friend and I generally dedicated our evenings to the entertainment of this obliging Lady  She loved reading  and was a woman of an excellent taste  but as her years rendered that employment not so easy to her as it had been  her son and myself usually spared her the task  and read to her such authors as she chose for her entertainment  nor was she so confined to particular studies  as not to allow us to vary our subjects as inclination led us   It happened one evening  which was on the eve of the day appointed for our departure  that we had made choice of the tragedy of Douglas for our entertainment  when a neighbouring lady  a sensible woman  who had drank tea with us  desired to make one of our auditors   After the tea table was removed  we entered on our task  my friend and I reading alternately  to relieve each other  that we might not injure the performance by a wearied or flat delivery   Neither of the ladies had ever seen or read this play before  and both gave that true testimony of nature to its merit  tears   When we had finished the reading of it  they each in her turn bestowed high praises on it  but the visitor lady said  that notwithstanding the pleasure it had afforded her upon the whole  she    had one great objection to it  We were all impatient to know what it was  I think said she  that the moral which it inculcates is a discouraging lesson  especially to youth  for the blooming hero of this story  though adorned with the highest virtues of humanity  truth  modesty  gratitude  filial piety  nobleness of mind  and valour in the most eminent degree  is not only buried in obscurity  by a severe destiny  till he arrives at manhood  but when he emerges into light  is suddenly cut off by an untimely death  and that at a juncture too  when we might  morally speaking  say his virtues ought to have been rewarded   We each spoke our thoughts on the subject  as opinion led us  when the old lady drew our attention  which she always does  whenever she delivers her sentiments   I should think as you do  madam  said she  if there were not too many melancholy precedents to give a sanction to the fable of that tragedy  I do not say but that the poet  who is at liberty to dispose as he pleases of the works of his own creation  may as well reward and punish according to the measures of justice in this life  it might perhaps make a better impression  and indeed afford a more prevalent example  to the generality of young people  I say therefore  I do not take upon me to defend an opposite conduct upon principles of poetic justice  but surely the poet who prefers that course  may be justified in it from every day’s experience  If we always saw virtuous people successful in their pursuits  and their days crowned with prosperity  there would be more force in your objection  but the direct contrary is a truth  which every body who has lived but a moderate number of years  must have been convinced of from their own observation  Amongst heathens indeed  who looked no farther than this life for good and evil  and whose only incitement to virtue was the praise of men  or what they called glory  such morals might be dangerous  but surely amongst us Christians they cannot  at least ought not to have any ill effect   On the contrary  I think it should serve to confirm that great lesson which we are all taught indeed  but which we seldom think of reducing to practice  viz  to use the good things of this life with that indifference  which things that are neither permanent in their own nature  nor of any estimation in the fight of God  deserve   On the other hand  to consider the evils which befall us  as equally temporary  and no more dispensed by the great ruler of all
