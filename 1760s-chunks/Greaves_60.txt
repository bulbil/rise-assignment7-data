masked lady s name was Miss Meadows  and that she  Dolly  was hired as her waiting woman    When the name of Meadows was mentioned  Sir Launcelot  whose spirits had been in violent commotion  became suddenly calm and serene  and he began to communicate to Clarke the dialogue which had passed between him and Captain Crowe  when the hostess  addressing herself to our errant   Well   said she   I have had the honour to accommodate many ladies of the first fashion at the White Hart  both young and old  proud and lowly  ordinary and handsome  but such a miracle as Miss Meadows I never yet did see —Lord  let me never thrive but I think she is of something more than a human creature —Oh  had your honour but set eyes on her  you would have said it was a vision from heaven  a cherubim of beauty —For my part  I can hardly think it was anything but a dream—then so meek  so mild  so good natured and generous  I say  blessed is the young woman who tends upon such a heavenly creature —And  poor dear young lady  she seems to be under grief and affliction  for the tears stole down her lovely cheeks  and looked for all the world like orient pearl    Sir Launcelot listened attentively to the description  which reminded him of his dear Aurelia  and sighing bitterly  withdrew to his own apartment             CHAPTER FOURTEEN  WHICH SHOWS THAT A MAN CANNOT ALWAYS SIP  WHEN THE CUP IS AT HIS LIP   Those who have felt the doubts  the jealousies  the resentments  the humiliations  the hopes  the despair  the impatience  and  in a word  the infinite disquiets of love  will be able to conceive the sea of agitation on which our adventurer was tossed all night long  without repose or intermission  Sometimes he resolved to employ all his industry and address in discovering the place in which Aurelia was sequestered  that he might rescue her from the supposed restraint to which she had been subjected  But when his heart beat high with the anticipation of this exploit  he was suddenly invaded  and all his ardour checked  by the remembrance of that fatal letter  written and signed by her own hand  which had divorced him from all hope  and first unsettled his understanding  The emotions waked by this remembrance were so strong  that he leaped from the bed  and the fire being still burning in the chimney  lighted a candle  that he might once more banquet his spleen by reading the original billet  which  together with the ring he had received from Miss Darnel s mother  he kept in a small box  carefully deposited within his portmanteau  This being instantly unlocked  he unfolded the paper  and recited the contents in these words —   SIR —Obliged as I am by the passion you profess  and the eagerness with which you endeavour to give me the most convincing proof of your regard  I feel some reluctance in making you acquainted with a circumstance  which  in all probability  you will not learn without some disquiet  But the affair is become so interesting  I am compelled to tell you  that however agreeable your proposals may have been to those whom I thought it my duty to please by every reasonable concession  and howsoever you may have been flattered by the seeming complacency with which I have heard your addresses  I now find it absolutely necessary to speak in a decisive strain  to assure you  that  without sacrificing my own peace  I cannot admit a continuation of your correspondence  and that your regard for me will be best shown by your desisting from a pursuit which is altogether inconsistent with the happiness of AURELIA DARNEL    Having pronounced aloud the words that composed this dismission  he hastily replaced the cruel scroll  and being too well acquainted with the hand to harbour the least doubt of its being genuine  threw himself into his bed in a transport of despair  mingled with resentment  during the predominancy of which he determined to proceed in the career of adventure  and endeavour to forget the unkindness of his mistress amidst the avocations of knight errantry   Such was the resolution that governed his thoughts  when he rose in the morning  ordered Crabshaw to saddle Bronzomarte  and demanded a bill of his expense  Before these orders could be executed  the good woman of the house entering his apartment  told him  with marks of concern  that the poor young lady  Miss Meadows  had dropped her pocket book in the next chamber  where it was found by the hostess  who now presented it unopened   Our knight having called in Mrs  Oakley and her son as witnesses  unfolded the book without reading one syllable of the contents  and found in it five banknotes  amounting to two hundred and thirty pounds  Perceiving at once the loss of this treasure might be attended with the most embarrassing consequences to the owner  and reflecting that this was a case which demanded the immediate interposition and assistance of chivalry  he declared that he himself would convey it safely into the hands of Miss Meadows  and desired to know the road she had pursued
