way  Poor counting house Gabriel  in amazement at the loftiness of their ideas  shrunk into insignificance  in spite of all his hoards  on a comparison with these wonderful men  As for me  in all the plausibility of moderation  I professed to wish for nothing more than a comfortable fortune  a snug box and a competence  whereupon these gluttons of the loaves and fishes cried out with one voice that I was wrong  absolutely criminal  for the prime minister would do anything upon earth for me  and it was an act of duty to anoint my fingers with bird lime  My honoured papa lost not a word of all this  and seemed  at going away  to take his leave with some complacency   Scipio went of course the next morning  to ask him how he liked me  Extremely well indeed  answered the knight of the ledger  the lad has won my very heart  But  good master Scipio  I conjure you by our long acquaintance to deal with me as a true friend  We have all our weak side  as you well know  Tell me where Signor de Santillane is fallible  Is he fond of play  does he wench  On what lay are his snug little vices  Do not fight shy  I beset you  It is very unkind  Signor Gabriel  to put such a question  retorted the go between  Your interest is more to me than my master s  If he had any slippery propensities  likely to make your daughter unhappy  would I ever have proposed him as a son  in law  The deuce a bit  I am too much at your service  But  between ourselves  he has but one fault  that of being faultless  He is too wise for a young man  So much the better  replied the goldsmith  he is the more like me  You may go  my friend  and tell him he shall have my daughter  and should have her though he knew no more of the minister than I do   As soon as my secretary had reported this conversation  I flew to thank Salero for his partiality  He had already told his mind to his wife and daughter  who gave me to understand by their reception  that they yielded without disgust  I carried my father in law to the Duke of Lerma  whom I had informed the evening before  and presented him with due ceremony  His excellency gave him a most gracious reception  and congratulated him on having chosen a man for his son in law  for whom he himself had so great a regard  and meant to do such great things  Then did he expatiate on my good qualities  and  in fact  said so much to my honour  that honest Gabriel thought he had met with the best match in Spain  His joy oozed out at his eyes  On parting  he pressed me in his arms  and said  My son  I am so impatient to see you Gabriela s husband  that the affair shall be finally settled within a week at latest       CH  II     In the progress of political vacancies  Gil Blas recollects that there is such a man in the world as Don Alphonso de Leyva  and renders him a service from motives of vanity   LET us leave my marriage to take care of itself for a season  The order of events requires me to recount a service rendered to my old master Don Alphonso  I had entirely forgotten that gentleman s existence  but a circumstance recalled it to my recollection   The government of Valencia became vacant at this time  and put me in mind of Don Alphonso de Leyva  I considered within myself that the employment would suit him to a nicety  and determined to apply for it on his be half  not so much out of friendship as ostentation  If I could but procure it for him  it would do me infinite honour  I told the Duke of Lerma that I had been steward to Don Caesar de Leyva and his son  and that having every reason in the world to feel myself obliged to them  I should take it as a favour if he would give the government of Valencia to one or other of them  The minister answered  Most willingly  Gil Blas  I love to see you grateful and generous  Besides  the family stands very high in my esteem  The Leyvas are loyal subjects  so that the place cannot be better bestowed  You may take it as a wedding present  and do what you like with it   Delighted at the success of my application  I went to Calderona in a prodigious hurry  to get the patent made out for Don Alphonso  There was a great crowd  waiting in respectful silence till Don Rodrigo should come and give audience  I made my way through  and the closet door opened as if by sympathy  There were no one knows how many military and civil officers  with other people of consequence  among whom Calderona was dividing his attentions  His different reception of different people was curious  A slight inclination of the head was enough for some  others he honoured with a profusion of courtly grimace  and bowed than out of
