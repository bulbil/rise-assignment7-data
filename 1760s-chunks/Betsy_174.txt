the abrupt manner of his quitting me         I know not as yet   replied Mr  Francis  with some vehemence   whether   I shall interfere any farther in the thing  and am heartily sorry I have   given myself any trouble about it  since you so little consider your own   interest  or will follow the advice of those who are at the pains to   consider for you     Come  come   said the elder Mr  Thoughtless   you   are both too fiery  I am confident my sister has too much good sense to   suffer any little caprice to impede her real happiness  therefore    pr ythee  Frank  let us drop this subject at present  and leave her to   her own reflections        To which Miss Betsy answered  that there required but little reflection   to instruct her what she ought to do  and that  though she could not   consent to be kept always in leading strings  the love and respect she   had for her brothers would never permit her to do any thing without   their approbation  There passed nothing more of consequence between them   at this visit  but what had been said  served to engross pretty much the   minds of each of them after they were separated                CHAPTER III       Has somewhat more business in it than the former          Though Miss Betsy was very conscious of the merits of Mr  Trueworth  and   equally convinced of the friendship her brother Francis had for him  and   had  therefore  doubted not but  when that young gentleman should   arrive  he would reason strongly with her on the little regard she had   paid to his recommendations  or the advantages of the alliance he had   proposed  yet she did not expect the satisfaction of their first meeting   would have been embittered by a resentment such as  it seemed to her  he   had testified on the occasion       She easily perceived the two brothers had consulted together  before   they come to her  in what manner they should behave towards her  and   this she looked upon as a sort of proof  that they intended to assume an   authority over her  to which they had no claim   The love I have for   them   said she to herself   will always make me take a pleasure in   obliging them  and doing every thing they desire of me  but they are   entirely mistaken  if they imagine it in their power to awe me into   compliance with their injunctions        And yet   cried she again   what other aim than my happiness and   interest can they propose to themselves  in desiring to have me under   their direction  Poor Frank has given me proofs that I am very dear to   him  and  I believe  my brother Thoughtless is not wanting in natural   affection for me  why  then  should I reject the counsel of two friends    whose sincerity there is not a possibility of suspecting  They know   their sex  and the dangers to which ours are exposed  by the artifices   of base designing men  I have had some escapes  which I ought always to   remember enough to keep me from falling into the like ugly accidents   again  How near was I to everlasting ruin  by slighting the warning   given me by Mr  Trueworth        This reflection bringing into her mind many passages of her behaviour   towards that gentleman  she could not forbear justifying his conduct    and condemning her own   I have certainly used him ill   pursued she    with a sigh   and if he should return  and forgive what is past  I think   I ought  in gratitude  to reward his love        She was in this contemplating mood when her servant told her that Mrs    Modely had been to wait upon her  but  on hearing her brothers were with   her  went away  saying she would come again  which she now was  and   begged to speak with her       Miss Betsy was at this moment just beginning to feel some sort of   pleasure in the idea of Mr  Trueworth s renewing his addresses  and was   a little peevish at the interruption  she ordered  however  that the   woman should come up   Well  Mrs  Modely   said she  as soon as she saw   her enter   what stuff have you brought me now         Ah  charming Miss Betsy   replied she   you fine ladies and great   fortunes
