 exclaimed the Duke d Almeyda in a menacing tone  for that only is competent to make me amends for the disgraceful step I have taken   With these words  he went away full of rage and shame  and sent to tell me  two hours after  that he was waiting for me  in a retired place  I kept the appointment  and found this nobleman ready to fight lustily  He was not five and forty  deficient neither in courage nor in skill  so that the match was fair and equal  Come on  Don Pompeyo  said he  let us terminate our difference here  Our hostility ought to be reciprocally mortal  yours  for my aggression  and mine  for having asked your pardon  These words were no sooner out of his mouth  than he drew upon me so suddenly  that I had no time to reply  He pressed very closely upon me at first  but I had the good fortune to put by all his thrusts  I acted on the offensive in my turn  the encounter was evidently with a man equally skilled in defence or in attack  and  there is no knowing what might have been the issue  if he had not made a false step in retiring  and fallen backwards  I stood still immediately  and said to the duke  Recover yourself  Why give me any quarter  he answered  Your forbearance only aggravates my disgrace  I will not take advantage of an accident  replied I  it would only tarnish my glory  Once more recover yourself  and let us fight it out   Don Pompeyo  said he rising  after this act of generosity  honour allows me not to renew the attack upon you  What would the world say of me  were I to wound you mortally  I should be branded as a coward for having murdered a man  at whose mercy I had just before lain prostrate  I cannot therefore again lift my arm against your life  and I feel my resentful passions subsiding into the sweet emotions of gratitude  Don Pompeyo  let us mutually lay aside our hatred  Let us go still further  let us be friends  Ah  my lord  exclaimed I  so flattering a proposal I joyfully accept  I proffer you my sincere friendship  and  as an earnest  promise never more to approach Donna Hortensia  though she herself should invite me  It is my duty  said he  to yield that lady to you  Justice requires me to give her up  since her affections are yours already  No  no  interrupted I  you love her  Her partiality in my favour would give you uneasiness  I sacrifice my own pleasures to your peace  Ah  too generous Castilian  replied the Duke  embracing me  your sentiments are truly noble  With what remorse do they strike me  Grieved and ashamed  I look back on the outrage you have sustained  The reparation in the King s chamber seems now too trifling  A better recompense awaits you  To obliterate all remembrance of your shame  take one of my nieces whose hand is at my disposal  She is a rich heiress  not fifteen  with beauty beyond the attractions of mere youth   I made my acknowledgments to the Duke in terms such as the high honour of his alliance might suggest  and married his niece a few days afterwards  All the court complimented this nobleman on having made such generous amends to an insulted rival  and my friends took part in my joy at the happy issue of an adventure which might have led to the most melancholy consequences  From this time  gentlemen  I have lived happily at Lisbon  I am the idol of my wife  and have not sunk the lover in the husband  The Duke d Almeyda gives me new proofs of friendship every day  and I may venture to boast of standing high in the King of Portugal s good graces  The importance of my errand hither sufficiently assures me of his confidence       CH  VIII     An accident  in consequence of which Gil Blas was obliged to look out for another place   SUCH was Don Pompeyo s story  which Don Alexo s servant and myself over heard  though we were prudently sent away before he began his recital  Instead of withdrawing  we skulked behind the door  which we had left half open  and from that station we did not miss a word  After this  the company went on drinking  but they did not prolong their carousals till the morning  because Don Pompeyo  who was to speak with the prime minister  wished for a little rest beforehand  The Marquis de Zenette and my master took a cordial leave of the stranger  and left him with his kinsman   We went to bed for once before daybreak  and Don Matthias  when he awoke  invested me with a new office  Gil Blas  said he  take pen  ink  and paper  and write two or three letters as I shall dictate  you shall henceforth be my secretary  Well and good  said I to myself  a plurality of functions  As footman  I follow my master s heels  as valet de chambre  I help him to
