so short a passage my hard fortune still attended me  our ship was taken by a Barbary corsair  the whole crew  and I among the number  being made slaves  It carries too much the air of romance to inform you of my distresses or obstinacy in this miserable state  it is enough to observe that I have been bought by several masters  each of whom perceiving my reluctance  rather than use violence  sold me to another  till it was my happiness to be at last rescued by you    Thus ended her relation  which I have abridg d  but as soon as we are arrived at Moscow  for which we intend to set out shortly  you shall be informed of all more particularly  In the mean time  the greatest addition to my happiness will be to hear of yours  Adieu     265  LETTER LVIII  From the same   THE news of your freedom lifts the load of former anxiety from my mind  I can now think of my son without regret  applaud his resignation under calamity  and his conduct in extricating himself from it   You are now free  just let loose from the bondage of an hard master  this is the crisis of your fate  and as you now manage fortune  succeeding life will be marked with happiness or misery  a few years perseverance in prudence  which at your age is but another name for virtue  will ensure comfort  pleasure  tranquility  esteem  too eager an enjoyment of every good that now offers  will reverse the medal  and present you with poverty  anxiety  remorse  contempt   As it has been observed that none are better qualified to give others advice  than those who have taken the least of it themselves  so in this respect I find myself perfectly authorized to offer mine  even though I should wave my paternal authority upon this occasion   The most usual way among young men who have no resolution of their own  is first to ask one friend s advice and follow it for some time  then to ask advice of another  and turn to that  so of a third  still unsteady  always changing  However  be assured that every change of this nature is for the worse  people may tell you of your being unfit for some peculiar occupations in life    266 but heed them not  whatever employment you follow with perseverance and assiduity  will be found fit for you  it will be your support in youth  and comfort in age  In learning the useful part of every profession  very moderate abilities will suffice  even if the mind be a little balanced with stupidity  it may in this case be useful  Great abilities have always been less serviceable to the possessors than moderate ones  Life has been compared to a race  but the allusion still improves  by observing that the most swift are ever the least manageable   To know one profession only  is enough for one man to know  and this  whatever the professors may tell you to the contrary  is soon learned  Be contented therefore with one good employment  for if you understand two at a time  people will give you business in neither   A conjurer and a taylor once happened to converse together  Alas  cries the taylor  what an unhappy poor creature am I  if people should ever take it in their heads to live without cloaths I am undone  I have no other trade to have recourse to  Indeed  friend  I pity you sincerely  replies the conjurer  but  thank heaven  things are not quite so bad with me  for if one trick should fail  I have a hundred tricks more for them yet  However  if at any time you are reduced to beggary  apply to me  and I will relieve you  A famine overspread the land  the taylor made a shift to live  because his customers could not be without cloaths  but the poor conjurer  with all his hundred tricks  could find none that had money to throw away  it was in vain that he   267 promised to eat fire  or to vomit pins  no single creature would relieve him till he was at last obliged to beg from the very taylor whose calling he had formerly despised   There are no obstructions more fatal to fortune than pride and resentment  If you must resent injuries at all  at least suppress your indignation until you become rich  and then shew away  the resentment of a poor man is like the efforts of a harmless insect to sting  it may get him crushed  but cannot defend him  Who values that anger which is consumed only in empty menaces   Once upon a time a goose fed its young by a pond side  and a goose in such circumstances is always extremely proud  and excessive punctilious  If any other animal without the least design to offend  happened to pass that way  the goose was immediately at him  The pond  she said  was hers  and she would maintain a right in it  and support her honour  while she had a bill to hiss  or a wing to flutter  In this manner she drove away ducks  pigs  and chickens
