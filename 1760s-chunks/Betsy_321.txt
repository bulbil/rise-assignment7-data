yours         Severe as this injunction is   replied he   my soul avows the justice   of it  and I submit     Farewel  then   said she  rising from her feet     Oh  farewel   cried he  and kissed her hand with emotions not to be   expressed   Farewel for ever   rejoined she  turning hastily away to   prevent his seeing the tears with which her eyes were overcharged  and   in that cruel instant overflowed her cheeks  She advanced with all the   speed she could towards the wicker gate  but  when there  could not   forbear giving one look behind  and  perceiving he had left the walk    and was proceeding through the garden  with folded arms  and a dejected   pace   Poor Trueworth   cried she  and pursued him with her eyes till he   was quite out of sight       Some readers may  perhaps  blame Mr  Trueworth  as having presumed too   far on the discovery of the lady s passion  and others  of a contrary   way of thinking  laugh at him for being so easily repulsed  but all  in   general  must applaud the conduct of Mrs  Munden  Till this dangerous   instance  she had never had an opportunity of shewing the command she   had over herself  and  as Mr  Eastcourt justly says             Ne er let the fair one boast of virtue prov d        Till she has well refus d the man she truly lov d                 CHAPTER XXII       Is less pleasing than the former          After this solemn parting between Mr  Trueworth and Mrs  Munden  that   lady s mind was in too much disorder to think what was become of the   little picture that had occasioned it  till  an hour or two after  the   maid of the house came running into the chamber with it in her hand     Does this pretty picture belong to you  Madam   said she  Mrs  Munden   started  but  soon recovering herself  answered that it did  said that   it was the picture of her youngest brother  and that she believed she   might pull it out of her pocket with her handkerchief  or some how or   other drop it in the walk   Aye  to be sure  it was so   said the maid     for it was there I found it  as I was going to the pump for some water    I saw something that glittered just by the little arbour  on which I ran   and took it up  but my mistress told me she believed it was yours  for   she knew your ladyship was in the walk this morning     I am glad thou   hast found it   replied Mrs  Munden   for it would have vexed me to the   heart to have lost it     Aye  to be sure  Madam   cried she   for it is   a sweet picture  your brother is a handsome gentleman  I warrant there   are a thousand ladies in love with him   Mrs  Munden could not forbear   smiling at the simplicity of the wench  but  willing to be rid of her    rewarded her honesty with a crown piece  and dismissed her       She was rejoiced  indeed  to have this picture once more in her   possession  not only because some other might have found and kept it    but also because she thought she might indulge herself in looking on it   without any breach of that duty to which she was resolved so strictly to   adhere  To be secure  however  from a second rencounter with the   original in that place  she kept close in the house  and stirred not out   of it all the time he was there  but her apprehensions on this score   were needless  Mr  Trueworth religiously observed the promise he had   made her  and  lest he should be under any temptation to break it while   so near her  took leave of his friend that same day  and returned to   London  but carried with him sentiments very different from those he had   brought down  as will hereafter appear       As to Mrs  Munden  she found that she had no less occasion for exerting   the heroine when alone  than when encircled in the arms of Mr    Trueworth  the accident which had betrayed the secret of her heart to   him had also discovered it to herself  She was now convinced that it was   something more than esteem
