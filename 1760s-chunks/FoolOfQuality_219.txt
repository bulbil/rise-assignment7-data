to the subject till the statute of   Marlbridge  chap  23  in the reign of Henry III      Many contract debts through vanity or intemperance   or borrow   money  or take up goods  with the intention of thieves and robbers    never to make return  When such suffer  they suffer deservedly   in expiation of their guilt  But there are unavoidable damages   by water  by tire  the crush of power  oppressive landlords  and   more oppressive lawsuits  death of cattle  failure of crop  failure of   payment in others   with thousands of such like casualties  whereby   men may become bankrupt  and yet continue blameless  And in all   such cases one would think that the present ruin was sufficient   calamity  without the exertion of law to make that ruin irreparable      As all the members of a community are interested in the life    liberty  and labours of each other  he who puts the rigour of pur   laws in execution  by detaining an insolvent brother in jail  is guilty   of a fourfold injury   first  he robs the community of the labours of   their brother  secondly  he robs his brother of all means of   retrieving his shattered fortune   thirdly  he deprives himself of the   possibility of payment   and lastly  he lays an unnecessary burden   on the public  who  in charity  must maintain the member whom he   in his cruelty confines      However  since the severity of law is such  that he whose mis    fortunes have rendered him insolvent must  make satisfaction      for so the savages esteem it   by surrendering his body to durance   tor life  it is surely incumbent on our legislators and governors to   make the condition of the unhappy sufferers as little grievous as   may be      But this most Christian duty  this most humane of all cares  is yet   to come   When a debtor is delivered up into the fangs of his jailer    he is consigned to absolute and arbitrary slavery   and woe be to the   wretch whose poverty may not have left him a sop for Cerberus    How more than miserable must be the state of those unhappy men    who are shut in from all possible redress or appeal against the   despotic treatment of their savage keepers  whose hearts are   habitually hardened to all sense of remorse  and whose ears are   rendered callous by incessant groans       We are credibly informed that it is usual with such keepers to   amass considerable fortunes from the wrecks of the wretched   to   squeeze them by exorbitant charges and illicit demands  as grapes   are squeezed in a vine press while one drop remains  and then   to huddle them together into naked walls and windowless rooms     having got all they can  and nothing further to regard  save the   return of their lifeless bodies to their creditors      How many of these keepers exact from their distressed prisoners   seven and eight shillings per week  for rooms that would not rent   at a third of that sum in any other part of this city   At times    nine of those wretched prisoners are driven to kennel together in a         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  227     hovel  fit only to stable a pair of horses  while many unoccupied   apartments are locked up from use  Even a sufficiency of the   common element of water is refused to their necessities  an advan    tage which the felons in Newgate enjoy  Public or private bene    factions are dissipated or disposed of at the pleasure of the keepers    regardless of the intention or order of the donors  And the apart    ments appointed to these miserable men are generally damp or   shattered in the flooring  and exposed  by breach or want of   windows  to the inclemency of night air  and all the rigour of the   season      But what avail their complaints if the legislature have not   authorized  or made it the duty  of some especial magistrates to   examine into and redress these crying abuses      But tell me  continued Mr  Fenton  were there any prisoners of   consideration among the confined debtors   A few  sir  of note  and   many who had been well to pass in the world  Among these    indeed  it was that every scene and species of misery was displayed    There you might see  as you have said  numerous families of   wretches  whose thin and tattered garments but ill defended their   shivering bodies from the inclemency of the elements  that blew   through shattered windows or came pouring from unstanched
