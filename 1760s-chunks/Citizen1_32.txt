the hands of the timid and the avaricious  that walls give little protection  unless manned with resolution  that too much commerce may injure a nation as well as too little  and that there is a wide difference between a conquering and a flourishing empire  Adieu     99  LETTER XXV  From the same   THO  fond of many acquaintances  I desire an intimacy only with a few  The man in black whom I have often mentioned  is one whose friendship I cou d wish to acquire  because he possesses my esteem  His manners it is true  are tinctured with some strange inconsistencies  and he may be justly termed an humourist in a nation of humourists  Tho  he is generous even to profusion  he affects to be thought a prodigy of parsimony and prudence  though his conversation be replete with the most sordid and selfish maxims  his heart is dilated with the most unbounded love  I have known him profess himself a man hater  while his cheek was glowing with compassion  and while his looks were softened into pity  I have heard him use the language of the most unbounded ill nature  Some affect humanity and tenderness  others boast of having such dispositions from nature  but he is the only man I ever knew who seemed ashamed of his natural benevolence  He takes as much pains to hide his feelings as any hypocrite would to conceal his indifference  but on every unguarded moment the mask drops off  and reveals him to the most superficial observer   In one of our late excursions into the country  happening to discourse upon the provision that was made for the poor in England  he seemed amazed how any of his countrymen could be so foolishly weak as to relieve occasional objects of   100 charity  when the laws had made such ample provision for their support  In every parish house  says he  the poor are supplied with food  cloaths  fire  and a bed to lie on  they want no more  I desire no more my self  yet still they seem discontented  I m surprized at the inactivity of our magistrates  in not taking up such vagrants who are only a weight upon the industrious  I m surprized that the people are found to relieve them  when they must be at the same time sensible that it  in some measure  encourages idleness  extravagance  and imposture  Were I to advise any man for whom I had the least regard  I would caution him by all means not to be imposed upon by their false pretences  let me assure you  Sir  they are impostors  every one of them  and rather merit a prison than relief   He was proceeding in this strain earnestly  to dissuade me from an imprudence of which I am seldom guilty  when an old man who still had about him the remnants of tattered finery  implored our compassion  He assured us that he was no common beggar  but forced into the shameful profession  to support a dying wife and five hungry children  Being prepossessed against such falshoods  his story had not the least influence upon me  but it was quite otherwise with the man in black  I could see it visibly operate upon his countenance  and effectually interrupt his harangue  I could easily perceive that his heart burned to relieve the five starving children  but he seemed ashamed to discover his weakness to me  While he thus hesitated between compassion and pride  I pretended to look another way  and he seized this opportunity of giving the poor   101 petitioner a piece of silver  bidding him at the same time  in order that I should hear  go work for his bread  and not teize passengers with such impertinent falsehoods for the future   As he had fancied himself quite unperceived  he continued  as we proceeded  to rail against beggars with as much animosity as before  he threw in some episodes on his own amazing prudence and oeconomy  with his profound skill in discovering impostors  he explained the manner in which he would deal with beggars were he a magistrate  hinted at enlarging some of the prisons for their reception  and told two stories of ladies that were robbed by beggarmen  He was beginning a third to the same purpose  when a sailor with a wooden leg once more crossed our walks  desiring our pity  and blessing our limbs  I was for going on without taking any notice  but my friend looking wishfully upon the poor petitioner  bid me stop  and he would shew me with how much ease he could at any time detect an impostor   He now therefore assumed a look of importance  and in an angry tone began to examine the sailor  demanding in what engagement he was thus disabled and rendered unfit for service  The sailor replied in a tone as angrily as he  that he had been an officer on board a private ship of war  and that he had lost his leg abroad in defence of those who did nothing at home  At this reply  all my friend s importance vanished in a moment  he had not a single question more to ask  he now only studied what method he should take to relieve him unobserved  He had however no easy   102 part to act  as he
