of a second savage freedom  and would have withdrawn it —Only one sigh over it  but one sigh  Oh—  said he  an Oh  half a yard long—and pressed it with his lips—But remember  madam  you are watched  I have half a dozen spies upon you  and the moment you find the man you can favour  up comes your Greville  cuts a throat  and flies his country   He stopt at the parlour door—One Letter  Miss Byron—Receive but one Letter from me   No  Mr  Greville  But I wish you well   Wishes  that  like the Bishop s blessing  cost you nothing  I was going to say No  for you  But you were too quick  It had been some pleasure  to have denied myself  and prevented the mortification of a denial from you   He went away  every one wishing him a good journey  and speaking favourably of the odd creature  Mrs  Reeves  in particular  thought fit to say  that he was the most entertaining of all my Lovers  But if so  what is it they call entertaining  And what are those others  whom they call my Lovers   The man  said I  is an immoral man  And had he not got above blushes  and above being hurt by   150 Love  he could not have been so gay  and so entertaining  as you call it   Miss Byron says true  said Mr  Reeves  I never knew a man who could make a jesting matter of the passion  in the presence of the object  so very deeply in Love  as to be hurt by a disappointment  There sits my saucebox  Did I ever make a jest of my Love to you  madam   No indeed  Sir  Had I not thought you most deplorably in earnest  you had not had any of my pity   Why look you there  now  That s a declaration in point  Either Mr  Orme  or Mr  Fowler  must be the happy man  Miss Byron   Indeed  neither   But why  They have both good estates  They both adore you  Sir Hargrave I see you cannot have  Mr  Greville dies not for you  tho  he would be glad to live with you  Mr  Fenwick is a still less eligible man  I think  Where can you be better  than with one of the two I have named   You speak seriously  cousin  I will not answer lightly  But neither of those gentlemen can be the man  Yet I esteem them both because they are good men   Well  but don t you pity them   I don t know what to say to that  You hold  that Pity is but one remove from Love  And to say I pity a man who professes to love me  because I cannot consent to be his  carries with it  I think  an air of arrogance  and looks as if I believed he must be unhappy without me  when  possibly  there may be hundreds of women  with any one of whom he might be more truly happy   Well  this is in character from you  Miss Byron  But may I ask you now  Which of the two gentlemen  Mr  Orme  or Mr  Fowler  were you obliged to have one of them  would you choose   Mr  Orme  I frankly answer  Have I not told Mr  Fowler so     151 Well  then  what are your objections  may I ask  to Mr  Orme  He is not a disagreeable man in his person  You own that you think him a good man  His sister loves you  and you love her  What is your objection to Mr  Orme   I don t know what to say  I hope I should perform my duty to the man to whom I shall give my vows  be he who he will  But I am not in haste to marry  If a single woman knows her own happiness  she will find that the time from eighteen to twenty four is the happiest part of her life  If she stay till she is twenty four  she has time to look about her  and if she has more Lovers than one  is enabled to choose without having reason  on looking back  to reproach herself for hastiness  Her fluttering  her romantic age  we all know something of it  I doubt  is over by twenty four  or it will hold too long  and she is then fit to take her resolutions  and to settle  I have more than once hinted  that I should be afraid to engage with one who thinks too highly of me beforehand  Nothing violent can be lasting  and I could not bear  when I had given a man my heart with my hand  and they never shall be separated  that he should behave to me with less affection than he shewed to me before I was his  As I wish not now to be made an idol of  I may the more reasonably expect the constancy due to friendship  and not to be affronted with
