may be a sufficient sample of the whole                CHAPTER XVIII       Treats on no fresh matters  but serves to heighten those already   mentioned          Mr  Goodman had staid abroad till very late that night the concert had   been performed  so was not a witness of any thing that had passed after   the company came home  but on Lady Mellasin s repeating to him every   thing she remembered  was very well pleased to hear that she had   reconciled the captain to him  though extremely sorry that the blunt   ill judged affection of that gentleman had exposed him to the ridicule    not only of Miss Betsy  but also of all her followers       That young lady  in the mean time  was far from having any commiseration   for the anxieties of those who loved her  on the contrary  she triumphed   in the pains she gave  if it can be supposed that she  who was   altogether ignorant of them in herself  could look upon them as sincere   in others  But  I am apt to believe  ladies of this cast regard all the   professions of love made to them  as  indeed  many of them are  only as   words of course  the prerogative of youth and beauty in the one sex  and   a duty incumbent on the other to pay  they value themselves on the   number and quality of their lovers  as they do upon the number and   richness of their cloaths  because it makes them of consideration in the   world  and never take the trouble of reflecting how dear it may   sometimes cost those to whom they are indebted for indulging this   vanity       That this  at least  was the motive which induced Miss Betsy to treat   her lovers in the manner she did  is evident to a demonstration  from   every other action of her life  She had a certain softness in her   disposition  which rendered her incapable of knowing the distress of   any one  without affording all the relief that was in her power to give    and had she sooner been convinced of the reality of the woes of love    the sooner she had left off the ambition of inflicting them  and    perhaps  have been brought to regard those who laboured under them    rather with too much than too little compassion  But of this the reader   will be able to judge on proceeding farther in this history       There were now three gentlemen  who all of them addressed this young   lady on the most honourable terms  yet did her giddy mind make no   distinction between the serious passion they had for her  and the idle   gallantry she received from those who either had no design in making   them  or such as tended to her undoing       Impatient to hear in what manner Mr  Trueworth would declare himself    and imagining he would come the next day  as he had made so handsome an   apology for not having waited on her the preceding one  she told Mr    Staple and Captain Hysom  in order to prevent their coming  that she was   engaged to pass that whole afternoon and evening with some ladies of her   acquaintance  Neither the captain nor Mr  Staple suspected the truth of   what she said  but the former was in too much haste to know some issue   of his fate to be quite contented with this delay       Miss Betsy was not deceived in her expectations  Soon after dinner was   over  she was told Mr  Trueworth had sent to know if she was at home    and begged leave to wait upon her  Lady Mellasin having a great deal of   company that day in the dining room  she went into an adjacent one to   receive him  He was charmed at finding her alone  a happiness he could   not flatter himself with on entering the house  he was assured  by the   number of footman that he saw in the hall  that many visitors were there   before him  This unexpected piece of good fortune  as he then thought   it  especially as he found her playing with the squirrel he had sent to   her the day before  so much elated him  that it brightened his whole   aspect  and gave a double share of vivacity to his eyes   May I hope   your pardon  Madam   said he   for presuming to approach you with so   trifling a present as that little creature     Oh  Mr  Trueworth     answered she   I will not forgive you if you speak slight of my   squirrel  though I am indebted to you for the pleasure he gives me
