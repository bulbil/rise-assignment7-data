it stands at present  I shall therefore amuse you  and myself  with an Hypothesis for this Purpose  and may  sometime or other  hereafter  refer it to wiser Heads than ours  whether there be any real Weight in this whimsical Opinion of mine  or no   I must first give your a short Account of Astronomy  This Globe of Earth  as well as all the Planets of our solar System  revolves about the Sun  which Rotation is effected from the compounding of two different Powers  the Centripetal  which is the common Gravity of Bodies  that mutually attract each other  and  if acting alone  would occasion the Earth to be swallowed up by the Sun  and the Centrifugal  which is a Force impulsed upon all the Planets  at their Creation  that directs them forward  in a right Line  and  if not counteracted by the first Power  would propel the Body on  through infinite Space  to all Eternity  Now both these Powers acting  by the almighty Oeconomy  upon our Earth  at the same Time  occasion a Motion compounded of both these Causes  every Revolution of which is performed in that Period of Time  that is called a Year  From what I have said it is plain  that  if the Centrifugal Power was taken away  the Earth must rush Page  172 into the Sun  and so be destroyed by Fire  But this would be a particular Act of the Almighty  and my Philosophy is to explain the Possibility and Probability of this Effect  by plain and natural Means  which I apprehend may be occasioned by increasing the Weight of the Earth  and consequently it s gravitating Powers  For I think natural Philosophers agree  that Bodies attract  in Proportion to their Quantity of Matter  which  at a certain Degree  will make the Centripetal overcome the Centrifugal Force  Now my Opinion is  that every living Creature  Man  Brute  Insect   c  which has been produced since the Creation  has made an Addition of so much Matter to the Earth  as it s Weight came to at it s Birth  The Increase of Bulk  during it s Life  I make no Account of  because that proceeds from the Consumption of the Fruits of the Earth  which drawing their Nourishment from the Earth itself  alters only the Form  not the specific Gravity  but that Weight  which the Creature brings into the World  is certainly an Addition  because the Parent neither eats or drinks more  to bring the Foetus to Perfection  than if she were not pregnant  and  if tried in Scales  would be found to be of equal Weight  before  and after—except in the Case of Sickness  or hard Labour  neither of which is the natural Consequence of Procreation  as may be observed from Brutes  and other Animals  Page  173 and from the Generality of the human Species too  who have not weakened or debauched their natural Forces by Luxury  Effeminacy  or Excess  I have no Library here  so must be excused  if I am not as full  and as correct  upon this Subject  as I might be  if I were among my Books  But I always write to you in the same loose Manner that Things occur to my Mind at first Thought  and often but just enter down Hints  to supply us with Topics for Conversation  when we are together   I am particularly pleased at this Hypothesis presenting itself to my Reflection  as the explanation of any Prophecy  by natural Means  is a stronger Motive to our Belief  than the mere Faith of it  from a Miracle  Now the Destruction of the World by Fire was denounced  as I apprehend  long before the Laws of Astronomy  or the Gravitation of Matter  was sufficiently known  to authorize such an Hypothesis as this  and  as I am not quite orthodox insome Points  I own that I heartily rejoice  when I can make Amends in others  and  in reasoning about Religion  or contemplating the Ways of Providence  I think we ought  in a stronger and more particular Manner  to apply an Observation  which I remember out of Longinus  That  in the reading of Homer  Plato  or any of those precious Spirits of Antiquity  when any Passages occur  to which we cannot readily Page  174 reconcile our Reason  we ought firmly to believe that  were those great Genii present to explain themselves  we should  to our Confusion  be convinced  that we only were guilty of those Errors  which we blindly charged upon them   I think I may now lay myself down to sleep  esteeming this Essay in the Place of a Prayer  And may I have the Blessing of it in my Dreams  by meeting you there in perfect Health   Have I not seen thee where thou hast not been   c    Adieu   LETTER CCXXXVIII   My Dearest Life   NO Words can express the distracted Situation of my Mind  nor give you any Idea of the ill Treatment I have received from —  Indeed  neither my Health nor Spirits can hold out much longer  But I will do all I can to support myself
