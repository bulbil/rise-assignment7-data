go   on  The confusion she was in hindered her from directing the chairmen   where to go  so they were carrying her home again  till she saw herself   at the end of the street where she lived  but then  recollecting all at   once where she had appointed to meet her brothers  she ordered them to   go to Golden Square       It seemed as if fate interested itself in a peculiar manner for the   mortification of this young lady  every thing contributed to give her   the most poignant shock her soul could possibly sustain  It was not   enough that she had heard the cruel tidings of what she looked upon as   the greatest of misfortunes  her eyes must also be witness of the   stabbing confirmation  The place of sale was within two houses of Sir   Bazil s  but  as she had never heard where that gentleman lived  could   have no apprehensions of the spectacle she was to be presented with  On   her chair turning into the square  she saw that side of it  to which she   had directed the men to carry her  crowded with coaches  horses  and a   great concourse of people  some waiting for the bridal bounty  but more   as idle spectators  At first  she imagined it was on the account of the   sale  but the same instant almost shewed her her mistake       Several footmen  with wedding favours in their hats  two of whom she   knew by their faces  as well as by their liveries  belonged to Mr    Trueworth  were just mounting their horses  The crowd was so thick about   the door  that it was with some difficulty the chair passed on  and she   had an opportunity of seeing much more than she desired  There were   three coaches and six  in the first went Sir Bazil and the new made Lady   Loveit  the father of Miss Mabel  and a young lady whom Miss Betsy had   sometimes seen in her company  in the second were seated Mr  Trueworth    his bride  Mrs  Wellair  and a grave old gentleman  the third was filled   by four maid servants  and the two valet de chambres of the two   bridegrooms  with a great deal of luggage before and behind  The ladies   and gentlemen were all in extreme rich riding habits  and the footmen    eleven in number  being all in new liveries  and spruce fellows  the   whole cavalcade altogether made a very genteel appearance       Miss Betsy  in spite of the commotions in her breast  could not forbear   standing a little in the hall  after she had got out of her chair  till   the whole had passed   Well   said she to herself  with a deep sigh     all is over  and I must think no more of Trueworth  But wherefore am I   thus alarmed  He has long since been lost to me  nor did I love him        She assumed all the courage her pride could supply her with  and had   tolerably composed herself before she went up into the sale room  yet   not so much but a paleness  mixed with a certain confusion  appeared in   her countenance  Mr  Munden  who happened to be there  as well as her   brothers  took notice of it  and asked if she was not well  to which she   replied  with an uncommon presence of mind  that she was in perfect   health  but had been frightened as she came along by a great black ox    who  by the carelessness of the driver  had like to have run his horns   quite into the chair  Mr  Munden  who never wanted politeness  and knew   how to put on the most tender air whenever he pleased  expressed an   infinity of concern for the accident she mentioned  and this behaviour   in him she either relished very well  or seemed to do so       What credit her brothers gave to the story of the ox is uncertain  they    as well as all the company in the room  had been drawn to the windows by   the noise of the cavalcade which had set out from Sir Bazil s  Every one   was talking of it when Miss Betsy entered  and  it is very probable  the   two Mr  Thoughtlesses might imagine it had an effect upon her  in spite   of the indifference she had always pretended  they were  however  too   prudent to take any notice  especially as Mr  Munden was present       Whatever were the troubles of this young lady  her spirits enabled her   to conceal them  and she gave her opinion of the goods to be disposed of   with as much exactitude as if her mind
