the keenness of her mental pangs than by the means which Siffredi used for her recovery  Languishingly did she raise her scarcely conscious eyes  when glancing on the author of her misery  as he was anxiously employed about her person          My lord  said she  with inarticulate and convulsive accents  I am ashamed to let you see my weakness  but death  which cannot be long in finishing my torments  will soon rid you of a wretched daughter  who has ventured to dispose of her heart without consulting you  No  my dear Blanche  answered Leontio  your death would be too dear a sacrifice  Virtue will resume her empire over your actions  The constable s proposals do you honour  it is one of the most considerable alliances in the state         I esteem his person and am sensible of his merit  interrupted Blanche  but  my lord  the king had given me encouragement to indulge         Daughter  vociferated Siffredi  breaking in upon her discourse  I anticipate all you have to say on that subject  Your partiality for the prince is no secret to me  nor would it meet my disapprobation under other circumstances  You should even see me active and ardent to secure for you the hand of Enriquez  if the cause of glory and the welfare of the realm demanded it not indispensably for Constance  It is on the sole condition of marrying that princess  that the late king has nominated him his successor  Would you have him prefer you to the crown of Sicily  Believe me  my heart bleeds at the mortal blow which impends over you  Yet  since we cannot contend with the fates  make a magnanimous effort  Your fame is concerned  not to let the whole nation see that you have nursed up a delusive hope  Your sensibility towards the person of the king might even give birth to ignominious rumours  The only method of preserving yourself from their poison  is to marry the constable  In short  Blanche  there is no time left for irresolution  The king has decided between a throne and the possession of your charms  He has fixed his choice on Constance  The constable holds my words in pledge  enable me to redeem it  I beseech you  Or if nothing but a paramount necessity can fix your wavering resolution  I must make an unwilling use of my parental authority  know then  I command you   Ending with this threat  he left her to make her own reflections on what had passed  He was in hopes that after having weighed the reasons he had urged to support her virtue against the bias of her feelings  she would determine of herself to admit the constable s addresses  He was not mistaken in his conjecture  but at what an expense did the wretched Blanche rise to this height of virtuous resolution  Her condition was that in the whole world the most deserving of pity  The affliction of finding her fears realized respecting the in fidelity of Enriquez  and of being compelled  besides losing the man of her choice  to sacrifice herself to another whom she could never love  occasioned her such storms of passion and alternate tossings of frantic desperation  as to bring with each successive moment a variety of vindictive torture  If my sad fate is fixed  exclaimed she  how can I triumph over it but by death  Merciless powers  who preside over our wayward fortunes  why feed and tantalize me with the most flattering hopes  only to plunge me headlong into a gulf of miseries  And thou too  perfidious lover  to rush into the arms of another  when all those vows of eternal fidelity were mine  So soon then is that plighted faith void and forgotten  To punish thee for so cruel a deception  may it please heaven  in its retribution  to make the conscious couch of conjugal endearment  polluted as it must be by perjury  less the scene of pleasure than the dungeon of remorse  May the fond caresses of Constance distil poison through thy faithless heart  Let us rival one another in the horrors of our nuptials  Yes  traitor  I mean to wed the constable  though shrinking from his ardent touch  to avenge me on myself  to be my own scourge and tormentor  for having selected so fatally the object of my frantic passion  Since deep rooted obedience to the will of God forbids to entertain the thought of a premature death  whatever days may be allotted me to drag on shall be but a lengthened chain of heaviness and torment  If a sentiment of love still lurks about your heart  it will be revenge enough for me to cast myself into your presence  the devoted bride or victim of another  but if you have thrown off my remembrance with your own vows  Sicily at least shall glory in the distinction of reckoning among its natives a woman who knew how to punish herself for having disposed of her heart too lightly   In such a state of mind did this wretched martyr to love and duty pass the night preceding her marriage with the constable  Siffredi  finding her the next morning ready to comply with his wishes  hastened to avail himself of this favourable disposition  He sent
