in acknowledgment of my zeal in more than one instance for his service and the good of the state  had been graciously pleased to confer this mark of distinction on me  I may safely say that the recollection of the act for which I was promoted effectually kept down my pride  Neither did the bashfulness of low birth ever forsake me  so that nobility to me was like a hair shirt to a penitent  I determined therefore to lock up the evidences of my shame in a private drawer  instead of blazoning them to dazzle the eyes of the foolish and corrupt       CH  VII     An accidental meeting between Gil Blas and Fabricio  Their last conversation together  and a word to the wise from Nunez   THE poet of the Asturias  as the reader  if he thought of him  may have remarked  was very negligent in his intercourse with me  It was not to be expected  that my employments would leave me time to go and look after him  I had not seen him since the critical discussion touching the Iphigenia of Euripides  when chance threw me across him  as he came out of a printing house  I accosted him  saying  So  so  Master Nunez  you have got among the printers  this looks as if we were threatened with some new production   You may indeed prepare yourselves for such an event  answered he  I have a pamphlet just ready for publication which is likely to make some noise in the literary world  There can be no question about its merit  replied I  but I cannot conceive why you waste your time in writing pamphlets  it should seem as if such squibs and rockets were scarcely worth the powder expended in their manufacture  It is very true  rejoined Fabricio  and I am well aware that none but the most vulgar gazers are caught by such holiday fire works  however  this single one has escaped me  and I must own that it is a child of necessity  Hunger  as you know  will bring the wolf out of the forest   What  exclaimed I  is it the author of the  Count of Saldagna  who holds this language  A man with an annuity of two thousand crowns  Gently  my friend  interrupted Nunez  I am no longer a pensioned poet  The affairs of the treasurer Don Bertrand are all at sixes and sevens  he has been at the gaming table  and played with the public money  an extent has issued  and my rent charge is gone post haste to the devil  That is a sad affair  said I  but may not matters come round again in that quarter  No chance of it  answered he  Signor Gomez Del Ribero  in plight as destitute as that of his poor bard  is sunk for ever  nor can he  as they say  by any possible contrivance be set afloat again   In that case  my good friend  replied I  we must look out for some post which may make you amends for the loss of your annuity  I will ease your con science on that score  said he  though you should offer me the wealth of the Indies as a salary in one of your offices  I would reject the boon  clerkships are no object to a partner in the firm of the Muses  a literary berth  or absolute starvation for your humble servant  If you must have it plump  I was born to live and die a poet  and the man whose destiny is hanging  will never be drowned   But do not suppose  continued he  that we are altogether forlorn and destitute  besides that we accommodate the requisites of independence to our finances  we do not look far beyond our noses in calculating the avenge of our fortunes  It is insinuated that we often dine with the most abstemious orders of the religious  but our sanctity in this particular is too credulously imputed  There is not one of my brother wits  without excepting the calculators of almanacs  who has not a plate laid for him at some substantial table  for my own part  I have the run of two good houses  To the master of one I have dedicated a romance  and he is the first commissioner of taxes who was ever associated with the Muses  the other is a rich tradesman in Madrid  whose lust is to get wits about him  he is not nice in his choice  and this town furnishes abundance to those who value wit more by quantity than quality   Then I no longer feel for you  said I to the poet of the Asturias  since you are satisfied in your condition  But be that as it may  I assure you once more  that you have a friend in Gil Blas  however you may slight him  if you want my purse  come and take it  it will not fail you at a pinch  and you must not stand between me and my sincere friendship   By that burst of sentiment  exclaimed Nunez  I know and thank my friend Santillane  in return  let me give you a salutary caution  While my lord duke is in his meridian  and you are all in all with
