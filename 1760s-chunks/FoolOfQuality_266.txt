observed a crowd gathering fast on the way  and   hastened like others to see what was the matter      As soon as he arrived  he perceived Mr  Gripe the constable at   the head of the posse  with his painted staff of authority exalted in   his hand  Pray  what are you about  Mr  Constable   says Harry    I am going  sir  to seize a robber who has taken shelter in yonder   waste hovel  And whom did he rob  He robbed Mr  Niggards   here  that is to say  his boy here  of a sixpenny loaf  Perhaps the   man was hungry  said Harry  and had not wherewithal to buy one    Pray tell me  my lad  how the affair was      Why  master  you must know as how Mr  Niggards  my master   here  sent me this morning to the town with a shilling to buy two   sixpenny loaves  So  as I was coming back  I met an able looking   man  who made me afraid with his pale and meagre face  My good   boy  says he  will you give me one of those loaves in charity  I   dare not  sir  says I   they are none of my own  Here  says he  I   will give you my hat for one of them   but this I refused  as his hat    to my thinking  was not worth a groat  Nay  says he  I must have   one of the loaves  that is certain  for I have a wife and seven   children all starving in yonder hovel  and while there is bread in   the world I cannot but snatch a morsel for them  So  as I told you    I was frighted  I gave him one of the loaves without any more   words  and away he run as fast as his legs could carry him   but I   followed him with my eye till I saw him safe lodged      Here Harry wiped his eye  and mused a while  Tell me truly   now  my good boy  continued he  if both those loaves had been your   own  would you willingly have given one of them to keep the poor   man and his family from perishing          TEE FOOL OF QUALITY  285     I would  sir  said the lad  with a very good will  And  had I a   sixpence of my own  I would have gone back with all my heart and   have bought another loaf  But my master is a hard man  and so I   was forced to tell him the truth      Here  my lad  says Harry   here is a crown  Go back  buy two   loaves for your master in place of the one he has lost  and keep the   remaining four shillings to yourself for your trouble  You see  Mr    Constable  continued he  you never can make any thing like felony   of this matter  The boy confesses that he gave the bread with a   very good will  and that he would not have informed had it not   been for fear of his master      It is very true  please your honour  replied Mr  Gripe   I myself   do pity the poor man from my heart  and will have nothing more   to say in this business      Stay a while  says Harry  perhaps we may find some further   employment for you  I think I should know the face of yonder   man  Is not that the Niggards whom you had in custody the other   day  and for whose deliverance I paid five and twenty pounds to his   creditors   The very man  sir  says Gripe      Harry then put his hand in his pocket  and taking out a small   scrip of parchment  exclaimed I am glad of what you tell me  with   all my heart   Indeed  I did not like the looks of the man at the   time  and that made me accept an assignment of this action  Here    Mr  Gripe  take your prisoner again into custody in my name    Away with him to jail directly   As the holy gospel has it     He   shall not depart thence till he has paid the utmost farthing   No    no  Mr  Niggards   I will not hear a word  Go and learn hence    forward to be merciful yourself  if you would look for any mercy   from God or man      Dicky  my dear  go back again  says Harry  our neighbour   Joseph here will see you safe home  I will not
