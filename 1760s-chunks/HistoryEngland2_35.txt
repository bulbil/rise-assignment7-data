 instead of immediately opposing him  to fly to the succour of the Emperor  his ally  who loudly requested his assistance  being pressed on every side by a victorious enemy  The English general was resolved to strike a vigorous blow for his relief  took with him about thirteen thousand   93 English troops  traversed extensive countries with an hasty march  arrived at the banks of the Danube  defeated a body of French and Bavarians stationed at Donavert to oppose him  passed the Danube  and laid the Dukedom of Bavaria  that had sided with the French  under contribution  Villeroy  who at first attempted to follow his motions  seemed  all at once  to have lost sight of his enemy  nor was he apprized of his route  till he was informed of his successes   Marshal Tallard prepared  by another route  to obstruct the Duke of Marlborough s retreat  with thirty thousand men  He was soon after joined by the Duke of Bavaria s forces  so that the French army amounted to a body of sixty thousand disciplined veterans  commanded by the two best reputed generals at that time in France  Tallard had established his reputation by former victories  he was active  penetrating  and had risen by the dint of merit alone  But this ardour often rose to impetuosity  and he was so short sighted as to be unable to distinguish at the smallest distance  and the Duke was remarkable for his resolution and personal bravery  On the other hand  the Duke of Marlborough was now joined by the Prince Eugene  a general bred up from his infancy in camps  and equal to Marlborough in intrigue and military knowledge  Their talents were congenial  and all their designs seemed to flow but from one source  Their army  when combined  amounted to about fifty two thousand men  troops that had been accustomed to conquer  and had seen the French  the Turks  and the Russians fly before them  As this battle  both from the talents of the generals  the improvements in the art of war  the number and discipline of the troops  and the greatness of the contending powers  is reckoned the most remarkable of this century  it demands a more particular detail     94 The French were posted on an hill  their right being covered by the Danube  and the village of Blenheim  and commanded by Marshal Tallard  their left was defended by a village  and headed by the Elector and Marsin  an experienced French general  In the front of their army ran a rivulet  the banks of which were steep  and the bottom marshy  Marlborough and Eugene went together to observe the posture of the French forces  Notwithstanding their advantageous situation  they were resolved to attack them immediately  The battle began between twelve and one in the afternoon  Marlborough  at the head of the English troops  having passed the rivulet  attacked the cavalry of Tallard in the right  This general was at that time reviewing the disposition of his troops in the left  and the cavalry fought for some time without the presence of their general  Prince Eugene  on the left  had not yet attacked the forces of the Elector  and it was an hour before he could bring his forces up to the engagement   Tallard had no sooner understood that his right was attacked by the Duke  but he flew to its head  He found a furious encounter already begun  his cavalry thrice repulsed  and rallied as often  He had a large body of forces in the village of Blenheim  he made an attempt to bring them to the charge  They were attacked by a part of Marlborough s forces so vigorously  that  instead of assisting the main body  they could hardly maintain their ground  All the French cavalry  being now attacked in flank  was totally defeated  The English army  thus half victorious  pierced up between the two bodies of the French  commanded by the Marshal and the Elector  while at the same time the forces in the village of Blenheim were separated by another detachment  In this terrible situation Tallard flew to rally some squadrons  but  from the weakness of his sight  mistaking a detachment of the enemy for his own  he   95 was taken prisoner by the Hessian troops  who were in English pay  In the mean time  Prince Eugene on the left  after having been thrice repulsed  put the enemy into confusion  The rout then became general  and the flight precipitate  The consternation was such that the French soldiers threw themselves into the Danube  without knowing where they fled  The officers lost all their authority  there was no general left to secure a retreat  The allies were now masters of the field of battle  and surrounded the village of Blenheim  where a body of thirteen thousand had been posted in the beginning of the action  and still kept their ground  These troops  seeing themselves cut off from all communication with the rest of the army  threw down their arms  and surrendered themselves prisoners of war  Thus ended the battle of Blenheim  one of the most complete victories that was ever obtained  Twelve thousand French and Bavarians were slain in the field  or drowned in the Danube  thirteen thousand were made prisoners
