of laÂ£ng  and taken his oath that   he had no private trade on board  nor anything which was not   contained in that account  they informed him what duties he   must pay on every article before he should be permitted to land   them      My master  though he was sufficiently apprised of this before    affected surprise  and attempted to expostulate with them on the   illegality and injustice of such a demand  alleging that the goods   had been purchased at the highest prices  in order to send a speedy   and effectual supply to the troops  who were known to want them    so that there could be no advance made upon them which could   defray such additional duties   that his owners  not in the least   suspecting any such  had given him no power to pay them  and that   many of the commodities  being of a perishable nature  must be   damaged  if not permitted to be landed directly  by which means   not only the merchants would be great losers  but also the troops   suffer severely for the want of common necessaries  which they   could not otherwise be supplied with  But all he could say had   no effect   they did not even deign to make him any answer  further   than that they had authority for what they did  and expected   obedience  not arguments  which they had not leisure to listen to      Such a repulse  however unjust in itself  and personally offensive          332 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     in the manner of it  was far from giving my master any concern    On the contrary  the difficulties which it threw upon the business   of his owners afforded him an opportunity of carrying on his own   private trade to advantage  which no oaths they could devise were   able to put a stop to  as an instance or two of his conduct will show      Some suspicion having arisen of his commerce with the sutler    of which no direct proof could be obtained  he was summoned to   appear before the tax gatherers  to acquit himself by his oath of   80 heinous an offence  The sutler  who knew the consequence of   being convicted  and with all hia knowledge of the world saw no   possibility of avoiding it  gave himself up as ruined  But my   master soon showed him the convenience of a conscience trained to   swearing  for  calling upon him the morning they were to appear at   the dread tribunal  and seeing him so cast down â€”   Cheer up    brother    said he    I ll bring you safe through the strait  By the   virtue and contents of this book    pulling one out of his pocket    and kissing it in form    I will never swear that you have bought   anything from me   so throw off that sneaking  Tyburn look  and   come along        Such an assurance naturally gave the sutler some spirits  though   he could not conceive how he meant to make it good   but a little   time cleared up the mystery  and showed him the force of a custom    house oath  As soon as the two culprits appeared before their   judges  the latter  assuming all the dignity of their office  exagger    ated the charge in the strongest colours  and administering the oath   to my master  demanded  in an authoritative tone  whether he had   not sold uncustomed goods to the sutler  and to what amount    who  not in the least disconcerted either by the question or the   manner in which it was put â€”   Why  look you  gentlemen    an    swered he  turning the quid in his clieek  and pulling up his breeches   at the hips with both his hands    as to that affair  by the virtue of   my oath  if I should swear that I sold liim any  I should be forsworn    and I ll always try to weather that point if I can        As there was no more than a general suspicion against the criminals    this answer satisfied the sagacity of their judges  and they were   dismissed with flying colours      When they were alone â€”   Well    said my master  shaking his   friend by the hand    I told you I would bring you off  Let that be   an example to you for the future  None but fools convict them    selves  and none but greater fools expect it  I should have little   business in the merchant s service if I scrupled to swallow such a   pin as that every day of
