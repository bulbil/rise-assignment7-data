who my grandfather used to say was worth them all  were her favourites   All this while honest Mr  Singleton had a smile at the service of every speaker  and a loud laugh always ready at the baronet s   Sir Hargrave seemed not a little pleased with the honest man s complaisance  and always directed himself to him  when he was disposed to be merry  Laughing  you know  my dear  is almost as catching as gaping  be the subject ever so silly  And more than once he shewed by his eyes  that he could have devoured Miss Cantillon  for generally adding her affected Te he  twisting and bridling behind her fan  to his louder  Hah  hah  hah  hah   What a length have I run  How does this narrative Letter writing  if one is to enter into minute and characteristic descriptions and conversations  draw one on  I will leave off for the present  Yet have not   80 quite dismissed the company  tho  I have done with the argument  that I thought to have parted with before I concluded this Letter   But I know I shall please my uncle in the livelier parts of it  by the handle they will give him against me  My grandmother and aunt Selby will be pleased  and so will you  my Lucy  with all I write  for the writer s sake  Such is their and your partial Love to  Their ever grateful HARRIET   LETTER XIV  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   BY the time tea was ready  Lady Betty whisperingly congratulated me on having made so considerable a conquest  as she was sure I had  by Sir Hargrave s looks  in which was mingled reverence with admiration  as she expressed herself  She took notice also of a gallant expression of his  uttered  as she would have it  with an earnestness that gave it a meaning beyond a common compliment  My cousin Reeves had asked Miss Clements if she could commend to me an honest  modest man servant  I  said Sir Hargrave can  I myself shall be proud to wear Miss Byron s livery  and that for life   Miss Cantillon  who was within hearing of this  and had seemed to be highly taken with the baronet  could hardly let her eyes be civil to me  and yet her really pretty mouth  occasionally  worked itself into forced smiles  and an affectation of complaisance   Sir Hargrave was extremely obsequious to me all the tea time  and seemed in earnest a little uneasy in himself  And after tea he took my cousin Reeves into the next room  and there made your Harriet the subject of a serious conversation  and desired his interest with me   He prefaced his declaration to Mr  Reeves  with   81 assuring him  that he had sought for an opportunity more than once  to be admitted into my company  when he was last at Northampton  and that he had not intruded himself then into this company  had he not heard I was to be there  He made protestations of his honourable views  which look d as if he thought they might be doubted  if he had not given such assurances  A tacit implication of an imagined superiority  as well in consequence as fortune   Mr  Reeves told him  It was a rule which all my relations had set themselves  not to interfere with my choice  let it be placed on whom it would   Sir Hargrave called himself an happy man upon this intelligence  He afterwards  on his return to company  found an opportunity  as Mrs  Reeves and I were talking at the furthest part of the room  in very vehement terms  to declare himself to me an admirer of perfections of his own creation  for he volubly enumerated many  and begg d my permission to pay his respects to me at Mr  Reeves s   Mr  Reeves  Sir Hargrave  said I  will receive what visits he pleases in his own house  I have no permission to give   He bowed  and made me a very high compliment  taking what I said for a permission   What can a woman do with these self flatterers   Mr  Walden took his leave  Sir Hargrave his  He wanted  I saw  to speak to me  at his departure  but I gave him no opportunity   Mr  Singleton seemed also inclined to go  but knew not how  and having lost the benefit of their example by his irresolution  sat down   Lady Betty then repeated her congratulations  How many Ladies  said she  and fine Ladies too  have sigh d in secret for Sir Hargrave  You will have the glory  Miss Byron  of fixing the wavering heart of a man who has done  and is capable of doing  a great deal of mischief     82 The Ladies  madam  said I  who can sigh in secret for such a man as Sir Hargrave  must either deserve a great deal of pity  or none at all   Sir Hargrave  said Miss Cantillon  is a very fine gentleman  and so looked upon  I assure you  And he has a noble estate
