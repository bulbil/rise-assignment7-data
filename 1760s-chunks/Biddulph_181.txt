hour he first saw me   I could easily see that he had a tender sympathizing heart  for he was moved to tears more than once during my relation  nor was he ashamed of them  for he suffered them to run down his cheek  whilst he listened with mute attention to my story  He praised Mr Faulkland highly  said he was a man after his own heart  and deserved the best woman in the world  I wish you had married him  said he  such a princely fellow deserves a princely fortune  He owned my brother had some reason to be nettled at my refusal of such a man  Our sex  said he  have not such chimæra notions as you women have  but still that does not excuse his sordidness   I took this opportunity of telling Mr Warner that my brother did not really know the very great distress I was in  and that I had reason to believe  from the general tenor of Lady Sarah’s character  that she had either concealed it from him  or made misrepresentations of my case  doubtless she had not informed him to what streights I was reduced immediately upon my mother’s death  and who knows but Sir George  having left me for a while to feel the effects of that resentment  with which he had threatened me in his last letter  still meant to shew himself a brother  for if he were ignorant  as I am willing to believe  of that particular which I have mentioned  he could not suppose that I was driven to absolute want  and from Lady Sarah’s insinuations  perhaps he thought that my mother left a sum of money behind her  He knew not of the illness that my children and I were visited with  and indeed it appears to me  from what he hinted to yourself  that he was quite unacquainted with my situation   To say the truth  Cecilia  as you know I am of a placable disposition  I should be glad to be on good terms with my brother  the only relation  my kinsman excepted  that I have in the world  I was willing therefore  if possible  a little to reconcile Mr Warner to him  as I durst not  without his permission  seek a reconciliation with Sir George   There may be something in what you say  coz  answered my friend  perhaps he had a mind to let you bite on the bridle for a while  and I am willing to suppose with you  that hereafter  may be  he would have    given you some dirty trifle  for a generous thing I am sure he is not capable of  from his sordidness to me  I found this stuck most with the good man  Oh  Sir  said I  but consider Lady Sarah’s influence stepped in there too  My brother  you acknowlege  was going to give you something  ’till she interposed —Half a crown  I suppose  said he  To say the truth  I believe she is the worst of the two  She has a great deal of pride  Sir  answered I  she has communicated some of it to my brother  probably he was mortified and disconcerted at the sight of so near a relation  in his wife’s presence  whose exteriour appearance could do him no credit  perhaps  had you applied privately to him  he would have behaved better  You have not much worldly wisdom  replied my cousin  to excuse him thus  however  I think the better of you for it  whatever I may do of him  But speak honestly now  don’t you want to be friends with Sir George  that he and his wife may have an opportunity of seeing you in all your finery  As I knew Mr Warner’s temper  I was resolved to humour him in it  and thought I could not give my desire of seeing my brother a better turn than this  to one of my kinsman’s disposition  To deal with you openly  Sir  said I  I think our triumph over Lady Sarah will not be complete  unless she herself is a witness of that high fortune  of which she might have been a partaker  had it not been for her own meanness of spirit  And to be sincere with you  my Cecilia  I did think Lady Sarah deserved this mortification  though it did not so far influence me as to make me desirous of being on terms with her  as for my brother  I was governed by no other motive than affection towards him   Well  said Mr Warner  suppose you were to invite them both to dine with you  and to have me at table  handsomely dressed out  for I can dress fine when I please  and let them see that the man  who was not thought worthy to sit down in their presence  they had better have used with more ceremony  Oh  Sir  said I  that would be too severe an insult  besides  I doubt whether my brother would come  you know he is angry with me  and thinks he has reason  If you will permit me first to call on my brother  when we are reconciled  I can afterwards ask both him and his lady to my house  and though
