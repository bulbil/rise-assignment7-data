which I had formerly known  my bosom  was not filled with the little deity  I could not help recalling to my  remembrance the fond  the ravishing moments I had passed with S    Had  I understood the conditions of life  those pleasures were happily  exchanged for my present situation  because  if I was now deprived  of those rapturous enjoyments  I was also exempted from the cares  and anxiety that attended them  but I was generally extravagant in my  notions of happiness  and therefore construed my present tranquility  into an insipid languor and stagnation of life    While I remained in this inactivity of sentiment  Lord     having  received a very considerable addition to his fortune  sent a message  to me  promising  that if I would leave Lord B    he would make me  a present of a house and furniture  where I should live at my case   without being exposed to his visits  except when I should be disposed to  receive them  This proposal he made in consequence of what I had always  declared  namely  that if he had not reduced me to the necessity  of putting myself under the protection of some person or other  by  depriving me of any other means of subsistence  I should never have  given the world the least cause to scandalize my reputation  and that I  would withdraw myself from my present dependence  as soon as he should  enable me to live by myself  I was therefore resolved to be as good as  my word  and accepted his offer  on condition that I should be wholly  at my own disposal  and that he should never enter my door but as a  visitant or common friend    These articles being ratified by his word and honour  the value  of which I did not then know  a house was furnished according to my  directions  and I signified my intention to Lord B    who consented  to my removal  with this proviso  that I should continue to see him  I  wrote also to his relation  Mr  B    who  in his answer  observed   that it was too late to advise  when I was actually determined  All my  friends and acquaintance approved of the scheme  though it was one  of the most unjustifiable steps I had ever taken  being a real act of  ingratitude to my benefactor  which I soon did  and always shall regret  and condemn  So little is the world qualified to judge of private  affairs    When the time of our parting drew near  Lord B   became gloomy and  discontented  and even entreated me to postpone my resolution  but I    6 22 15  3 45 PM   told him  that now everything was prepared for my reception  I could not  retract without incurring the imputation of folly and extravagance   On the very day of my departure  Mr  B   endeavoured  with all the  arguments he could suggest  to dissuade me from my purpose  and I  made use of the same answer which had satisfied his friend  Finding me  determined on removing  he burst out into a flood of tears  exclaiming    By God  if Lord B   can bear it  I can t   I was thunderstruck at this  expression  for though I had been told that Mr  B   was in love with  me  I gave no credit to the report  because he had never declared his  passion  and this was the first hint of it that ever escaped him in  my hearing  I was therefore so much amazed at the circumstance of this  abrupt explanation  that I could make no answer  but having taken my  leave  went away  ruminating on the unexpected declaration    Lord B    as I was informed  spoke not a word that whole night  and  took my leaving him so much to heart  that two years elapsed before he  got the better of his grief  This intelligence I afterwards received  from his own mouth  and asked his forgiveness for my unkind retreat   though I shall never be able to obtain my own  As for Mr  B    he was  overwhelmed with sorrow  and made such efforts to suppress his concern   as had well nigh cost him his life  Dr  S   was called to him in the  middle of the night  and found him almost suffocated  He soon guessed  the cause  when he understood that I had left the house  So that I  myself was the only person concerned  who was utterly ignorant of his  affection  for I solemnly declare he never gave me the least reason  to suspect it while I lived with his relation  because he had too much  honour to entertain a thought of supplanting his friend  and too good an  opinion of me to believe he should have succeeded in the attempt  Though  my love for Lord B   was not so tender and interesting as the
