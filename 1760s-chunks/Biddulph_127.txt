 ’till a day or two before  and hoped I would allow him the honour of renewing his acquaintance  I had hardly temper enough to make him a civil answer  but said  I was sorry I was engaged that evening  and must be obliged to go out immediately  I thought this hint was enough for Mrs Arnold  and that she would have had the discretion to have taken her leave  She asked pardon for having kept me at home so long  protesting she had really forgot that I told her I was engaged  She begged she might not detain me any longer  saying  she had ordered her chariot to come for her in the evening  and that she would wait for it  as she found herself not very well  and therefore not able to walk home  I now saw into the whole scheme  Mr Faulkland would naturally stay to keep her company  and they would have my house to themselves  but I resolved to disappoint them both  and telling Mrs Arnold I would leave her at home  ordered the chariot to the door  Mrs Arnold opposed this  under pretence of not giving me so much trouble  and pretending to be sick and faint  said she would step to the door  in order to get a little more air  I followed her hastily  and your coming in the instant  I suppose  detained Mr Faulkland in the parlour  for he could not but see you from the window  You know the rest  added Mrs Gerrarde  and I leave you to judge  whether Mrs Arnold be inclined to keep her word with you  in regard to Mr Faulkland   Can you blame me  Madam  proceeded your husband  if  after what I now saw and heard  I was enraged almost to madness against my wife  The base woman  who had now accomplished her wicked purpose  encouraged me in my desperation  In the midst of my fury  however  I could not help making one observation  which was  that as Mrs Gerrarde’s going  or pretending to go out that evening  was a casual thing  they could hardly have expected an opportunity of being alone at her house  even though the meeting was concerted  Mrs Gerrarde answered  That was very true  and she supposed there was    nothing at first farther intended  than that the lovers should have the pleasure of seeing and conversing together  as they had been so long separated  the other  to be sure  said she  was an after thought  which the opportunity suggested  She then  after making me swear secrecy  told me  that Mrs Arnold had  when she followed her out to the door  conjured her not to tell me that Mr Faulkland and she  Mrs Gerrarde  were acquainted  for  said she  as Mr Arnold is of a jealous temper  and has heard that Mr Faulkland formerly courted me  he would not suffer me to come near your house  if he knew that Mr Faulkland visited you  I promised her I would not  added Mrs Gerrarde  and I make no doubt but that she hoped in time  relying on my good nature  my seeming fondness for her  and the easiness of my temper  to engage me as the confidant and abettor of her loose amour   Mrs Gerrarde concluded with saying  that she believed nothing criminal had as yet passed between Mr Faulkland and my wife  at least since his coming to V—— hall  but as there was no with holding a woman from her will  it was very probable that Mrs Arnold would contrive the means of meeting  though not at her house  yet somewhere else  I raved  threatened  talked of fighting Faulkland  and locking up my wife  She artfully dissuaded me from such violent measures by a number of arguments  which I will not trouble you with repeating  Amongst other things  she said  that I had no right to call Faulkland to an account merely from surmise  which was all I had to ground my charge on  and though there was the strongest reason to believe he had dishonourable designs on Mrs Arnold  yet as I could not directly accuse him of them  I should be laughed at for engaging in a quarrel  which to the world would appear to be so ill grounded  As to what I threatened in regard to my wife  she said  such measures only make a woman desperate  and would be far from preventing the evil  in short  that it would be better to part quietly  without embroiling myself with her friends  or undertaking the hateful office of becoming gaoler to my wife  She found me but too well disposed to follow her fatal counsel  I wrote that cruel letter to my wife  which turned her from her home  at Mrs Gerrarde’s house  She kept me with her till midnight  and had worked up my resentment to such a pitch  that I determined not to see Mrs Arnold any more  To avoid expostulations  I went to a friend’s house  at the distance of several miles  When I came back  Mrs Gerrarde told me that Mr Faulkland was absent from V—— hall  and she concluded the    lovers were now together   I interrupted your
