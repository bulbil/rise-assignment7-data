what you promised Dr  Bartlett should do for me   I have been requesting the doctor to fulfil my engagements   And I am ready to obey  said the good man  My agreeable task shall soon be performed   As I was at the door  going up stairs to my closet  I courtesied  and pursed my intention   He bowed  said nothing  and looked  I thought  as if he were disappointed  that I did not return to company —No  indeed   Yet I pity him  at my heart  How odd is it  then  to be angry with him —So much goodness  so much sensibility  so much compassion  whence all his woes  I believe   never met together  in a heart so manly   Tell me  tell me  my dear Lucy—Yet tell me nothing till I am favoured with  and you have read  the account that will be given me by Dr  Bartlett  Then  I hope  we shall have every thing before us   Saturday  March 25   HE  Yet why that disrespectful word —Fie upon me  for my narrowness of heart   Sir Charles is setting out for town  He cannot be happy  himself  He is therefore giving himself the pleasure of endeavouring to make his friend happy  He can enjoy the happiness of his friends  O the blessing of a benevolent heart  Let the world frown as it will upon such a one  it cannot possibly bereave it of all happiness —Fortune do thy worst  If Sir Charles Grandison canot be happy with his Clementina  he will make himself a partaker of Lord G  s happiness  and as that   197 will secure  if not her own fault  the happiness of his sister  he will not be destitute of selicity  And let me  after his example—Ah  Lucy  that I could —But in time  I hope  I shall deserve  as well as be esteemed  to be the girl of my grandmamma and aunt  and then  of course  be worthy to be called  my dear Lucy   YOUR HARRIET BYRON   Saturday Noon   SIR CHARLES is gone  and I have talked over the matter again with the Ladies and Lord L   What do you think —They all will have it—and it is a faithful account  to the very best of my recollection—They all will have it  That Sir Charles s great struggle  his great grief  is owing—His great struggle  I don t know what I write  I think—But let it go  is between his Compassion for the unhappy Clementina  and his Love —for—Somebody else   But who  my dear  large as his heart is  can be contented with half an heart  Compassion  Lucy —The compassion of such an heart—It must be Love —And ought it not to be so to such a woman —Tell me—Don t you  Lucy  with all yours  pity the unhappy Clementina  who loves  against the principles of her religion  and in that respect  against her inclination  a man who cannot be her s  but by a violation of his honour and conscience  What a fatality in a Love so circumstanced —To love against inclination  What a sound has that  But what an absurdity is this passion called Love  Or  rather  of what absurd things does it make its votaries guilty  Let mine be evermore circumscribed by the laws of reason  of duty  and then my recollections  my reflexions  will never give me lasting disturbance   Dr  Bartlett has desired me to let him know what the particular passages are  of which I more immediately   198 wish to be informed  for our better understanding the unhappy Clementina s story  and has promised to transcribe them  I have given him a list in writing  I have been half guilty of affectation  I have asked for some particulars that Sir Charles referred to  which are not so immediately interesting  The history of Olivia  of Mr  Beaumont  the debates Sir Charles mentioned  between himself and Signor Jeronymo  But  Lucy  the particulars I am most impatient for  are these   His first conference with Lady Clementina on the subject of the Count of Belvedere  which her father and mother over heard   The conference he was desired to hold with her  on her being seized with melancholy   Whether her particularly chearful behaviour  on his departure from Bologna  is any where accounted for   By what means Mrs  Beaumont prevailed on her to acknowlege a passion so studiously concealed from the tenderest of parents   Sir Charles s reception  on his return from Vienra   What reception his proposals of compromise  as to reli••• and residence  met with  as well from the family  as from Clementina   The most important of all  Lucy—The last distres•••〈◊〉  What made it necessary  what happened at Bologna afterwards  and what the poor Clementina s situation now is   If the doctor is explicit  with regard to this article  we shall be able to account for their desiring him to revisit them at Bologna  after so long an absence  and for his seeming to think it will be to no purpose to oblige
