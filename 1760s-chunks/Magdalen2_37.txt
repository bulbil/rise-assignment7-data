the company  as   219 he was intimately known by character to every body  though with some he might be unacquainted by person —He accordingly complied  but judge  my dear  the universal astonishment  when  at the very instant of his entrance  Mrs Beauclerck screamed out   Mr  Villars  —and fell back into her chair —Alarmed at the name  the manner  and the voice  he flew to her  and exclaiming    O my Nancy  my Nancy   raised her up in his arms  while her beautiful daughter ran wild to her assistance  not knowing what to think of this extravagant surprize —Not to keep you any longer in suspence  my dear lady Blandford  the company soon discovered  that Mrs  Beauclerk was the long lost wife of Mr  Melmoth  and that some very extraordinary circumstance had divided them  without any fault on either side  for a painful series of years —What  however  appeared very strange  was    220 that each imagined the other to be dead  and that the information concerning the death of each  was communicated to the other  by no less indubitable a channel of intelligence  than Mr  Melmoth s own father —Mr  Melmoth s father  it seems  was a great East India merchant  and intended to give his son a large fortune—but the young gentleman falling in love  and marrying contrary to his father s consent  the old man would not be reconciled to him upon any terms  but his taking a voyage to the Indies  and continuing abroad for an interval of three years —Mr  Melmoth  having no resource for the maintenance of his wife  but his father s bounty  thought it better to accept of these cruel conditions  than to expose the woman of his soul to penury and distress  he complied  therefore  though with a bleeding heart  and accordingly set out in about thirteen months after their marriage    221 just as she had been delivered of a daughter —He had scarce reached the place of his destination in the Indies  when his father wrote over a melancholly letter  containing an account of his wife s death  and his child s  and advising him to think of enlarging the term of his residence in that quarter of the globe  This was an advice which  the young gentleman readily pursued  After the loss of all that was most dear to his wishes  England became hateful to his thoughts  and he did not return  till two years after the death of his father  when he had the mortification to find  that the old gentleman had left all his wealth to some remoter branches of his family —Young Mr  Villars  for so I shall now call him  though disappointed in his expectations of succeeding to his father s fortune  was  however  in very affluent circumstances himself  During his residence abroad  he had acquired   222 immense riches  and had been left by a friend no less than eighty thousand pounds to take the name of Melmoth  His property  when he came home  he chiefly laid out in the purchase of lands  and Bob has told me repeatedly  the value of his estates is a clear seven thousand a year —Yet  though he came home a very young man  and a very rich one  he still avoided mixing much with society —The company of women he particularly shunned  and employed himself chiefly in acts of beneficence  and literary researches —I don t recollect by what accident my brother Bob and he became originally acquainted—but  notwithstanding the disparity of years  and the diametrically opposite cast of complexions  he entertained a very high esteem for Bob  and would sometimes  on his account  visit at my house  and be sociable —I always respected him—I saw what an excellent heart he   223 possessed  and he gained my esteem entirely  by the almost parental solicitude which he shewed for the welfare of my giddy headed brother—and see  my dear  how Providence has rewarded him —In the very moment that he was labouring for the happiness of other people  we see his own tranquillity restored  and find  that the benignity which induced him to mitigate the distresses of his friends  has been the principal means of removing all those distresses under which he struggled himself —Who  lady Blandford  ought not to be virtuous  even from interest —since  if the consciousness of having performed a good action  is not a sufficient reward  we are so generally certain of finding it highly to our advantage in the end —But now  to say something of Mrs  Villars—This lady  on the supposed death of her husband  was reduced to some difficulties for support—and  had not a   224 distant relation unexpectedly left her a considerable sum of money  she  perhaps  had found it necessary to work for bread  Old Mr  Villars would not advance her a shilling —and few are fond of cultivating a friendship with calamity —Soured  therefore  at the world  and absolutely wretched for the loss of her husband  the moment she found herself in circumstances  she retired to a sequestered habitation in the country  and has lived there ever since in a very private manner  visiting very few people  and continuing an intimacy scarcely at any house but Mr
