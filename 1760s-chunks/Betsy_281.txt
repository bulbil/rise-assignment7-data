higher rate than three   pieces        Though all this passed on both sides in a jocose way  yet  as it served   to shew the niggardliness of Mr  Munden s temper  cannot be supposed to   have increased either the love or respect his wife had for him       She made  however  no other answer to what he had last said  than to   tell him she found he was fashionable enough to suffer virtue to be it s   own reward  and then turned the conversation  and continued in the same   chearful humour as before any mention had been made of the three   guineas  Mr  Munden did not go abroad the whole evening  but whether he   chose to sup at home for the pleasure of enjoying his wife s company  or   for the sake of partaking of the remainder of those dainties which had   been so highly praised at dinner  is a point which  perhaps  might admit   of some dispute       It is certain  indeed  the yet unsubdued vanity of this young lady made   her feel so much innate satisfaction in the admiration their noble   visitor had expressed of her person and accomplishments  as gave a   double sprightliness to her conversation that whole evening  and might    perhaps  render her more than ordinarily lovely in the eyes of her   husband       It is very far from being an improbability that some people may be apt   to imagine she built a little too much on the veracity of the praises   bestowed upon her by that nobleman  but those who think this way  will   be convinced of their error when they shall presently find how far her   conjectures were justified in this point       She was sitting the next morning in a careless posture at one of the   windows that looked into the street  ruminating sometimes on one thing    and sometimes on another  when she could not help observing a fellow on   the other side of the way  who kept walking backwards and forwards    before the house  which  though he frequently passed thirty or forty   paces  yet he took care never to lose sight of       This seemed a little odd to her  as she sat there a considerable time    and the man still continued on his post  she doubted not but that he   wanted to speak with some one or other of her family  but had not the   least notion his business was with herself       Being told breakfast waited for her  she went into her dressing room    where she usually took it  and thought no farther of the man till Mr    Munden was dressed and gone out  but in less than a minute after he was   so  she received intelligence from her footman  that there was a person   had a letter for her  and said he would deliver it into no hands but her   own       On this she ran immediately down stairs  and found  to her great   surprize  that he was no other than the fellow that she had seen   loitering so long about the house   I am ordered  Madam   said he   to   give you this   and at the same time presented her with a letter   From   whom does it come   demanded she   I am ignorant   answered he   both of   the person who sent it  and the business it contains  my orders were   only to deliver it into your own hands   and with these words went away   with all the speed he could       It must be confessed  a married woman ought not to have received a   letter brought her in this manner  and without knowing whence it came    but curiosity prevailed above discretion  and she  hastily opening it    found it contained these lines             To Mrs  Munden            Loveliest of your sex            As not to adore you would be the greatest proof of insensibility         so not to wish  and even attempt every thing consistent with the        character of a man of honour  for the obtaining some reward for        that adoration  would be the most stupid piece of self denial         becoming only of a stoick  or one more dead to all the joys of        life  The force of your charms has made the conquest of a heart        which only waits a favourable opportunity of throwing itself at
