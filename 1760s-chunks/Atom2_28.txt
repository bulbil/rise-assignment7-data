the   164 council of Twenty Eight  they thwarted every plan he proposed  and turned into ridicule every word he spoke  At length they bluntly told the Dairo  that as Yak strot resigned the reins of administration in public  he must likewise give up his management behind the curtain  for they were not at all disposed to answer to the people for measures dictated by an invisible agent  This was but a reasonable demand  in which the emperor seemed to acquiesce  But the new ministers thought it was requisite that they should commit some overt act of contempt for the abdicated Cuboy  One of his nearest relations had obtained a profitable office in the island of Ximo  and of this  the new cabal insisted he should be immediately deprived  The Dairo remonstrated against the injustice of turning a man out of his place for no other   165 reason but to satisfy their caprice  and plainly told them he could not do it without infringing his honour  as he had given his word that the possessor should enjoy the post for life  Far from being satisfied with this declaration  they urged their demand with redoubled importunity  mixed with menaces which equally embarrassed and incensed the goodnatured Dairo  At last Yak strot  taking compassion upon his indulgent master  prevailed upon his kinsman to release him from the obligation of his word  by making a voluntary resignation of his office  The Dairo fell sick of vexation  his life was despaired of  and all Japan was filled with alarm and apprehension at the prospect of an infant s ascending the throne  for the heir apparent was still in the cradle   Their fears  however  were happily disappointed by the recovery of   166 the emperor  who  to prevent as much as possible the inconveniences that might attend his demise  during the minority of his son  resolved that a regency should be established and ratified by the states of the empire  The plan of this regency he concerted in private with the venerable princess his grandmother  and his friend Yak strot  and then communicated the design to his ministers  who knowing the quarter from whence it had come  treated it with coldness and contempt  They were so elevated by their last triumph over the Ximian favourite  that they overlooked every obstacle to their ambition  and determined to render the Dairo dependant on them  and them only  With this view they threw cold water on the present measure  and to mark their hatred of the favourite more strongly in the eyes of   167 Legion  they endeavoured to exclude the name of his patroness the Dairo s grandmother  from the deed of regency  though their malice was frustrated by the vigilance of Yak strot  and the indignation of the states  who resented this affront offered to the family of their sovereign   The tyranny of this junto became so intolerable to Gio gio  that he resolved to shake off their yoke  whatever might be the consequence  but before any effectual step was taken for this purpose  Yak strot  who understood mechanics  and had studied the art of puppet playing  tried an experiment on the organs of the cabal  which he tempered with individually without success  Instead of uttering what he prompted  the sounds came out quite altered in their passage  Gotto mio grunted  the Financier Twitz er bleated  or rather brayed  one scribe mewed like a   168 cat  the other yelped like a jackall  In short  they were found so perverse and refractory  that the master of the motion kicked them off the stage  and supplied the scene with a new set of puppets made of very extraordinary materials  They were the very figures through whose pipes the charge of mal administration had been so loudly sounded against the Ximian favourite  They were now mustered by the Fatzman  and hung upon the pegs of the very same puppet shew man against whom they had so vehemently inveighed  Even the superannuated Fika kaka appeared again upon the stage as an actor of some consequence  and insisted upon it  that his metamorphosis was a meer calumny  But Taycho and Lob kob kept aloof  because Yak strot had not yet touched them on the proper keys     169 The first exhibition of the new puppets  was called Topsy turvy  a farce in which they overthrew all the paper houses which their predecessors had built  but they performed their parts in such confusion  that Yak strot interposing to keep them in order  received divers contusions and severe kicks on the shins  which made his eyes water  and  indeed  he had in a little time reason enough to repent of the revolution he had brought about  The new sticks of administration proved more stiff and unmanageable than the former  and those he had discarded  associating with the blatant Beast  bedaubed him with such a variety of filth  drained from all the sewers of scurrility  that he really became a public nuisance  Gotto mio pretended remorse of conscience  and declared he would impeach Yak strot for the peace   170 which he himself had negotiated  Twitz er snivelled and cried  and cast figures to prove that Yak strot was born for the destruction of Japan  and Zan ti fic lured an incendiary Bonze called Toks  to throw fire balls by
