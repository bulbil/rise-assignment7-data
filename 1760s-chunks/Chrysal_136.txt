me for   the cause of her coming there  for it was I who had made you a great   man  Now  what could this possibly mean  but what has happened   here this moment  when  by giving you this title first  and  Lord   knows  I did it without the least design  or even being sensible ot   it when I did it   I may  in some manner  be said to have made you   the great man it belonged to  Let the world say what they will    I do believe there is truth in dreams  and I think mine is out now            144 ADVENTUBES OF A GUINEA     She ran on with this rant at such a rate  that it was impossible   for the bishop to interrupt her  even had he been so inclined  But   that was far from being the case  He heard her with attention    and what she said made such an impression on him  that he sat   some time musing on it after she had stopped  before he had power   to speak a word      As for hia lady  she at once took it to be all a fetch  calculated   merely to forward the scheme of the wager about the doctor s   living  and as such  resolved to humour it  and not interrupt   his meditations   but addressing herself to the other    Indeed   madam    said she    I do not know what to say to this affair  When   you told me your dream just now  I made nothing of it  but this   account of his grace s death almost staggers me  Well  if this   succeeds  and who knows what may happen  I shall ever hereafter   have more faith in dreams            CHAPTER XLV     A DISSERTATION ON DBBAMINO â€” THE DEBAM PTTEStTBD TO THE ASTON    ISHMENT AND ALMOST CONVBKSION OF THE BISHOP S LADY â€” HEB   VEBACITY IN BECOtTNTINO SOME CIEODMSTANCBS RELATING TO IT   â€” SHE AND HIS LOEDSHIP PERSUADE EACH OTHER TO DREAM THAT   IT IS TBTJE     By this time his lordship had considered the matter  and addressing   himself to the dreamer â€”   Pray  madam    said he    what time had   you this vision or dream   In the night  or towards the morning           In the morning  my lord    replied she    at the conclusion of my   second sleep   and  indeed  it made such an impression upon my   mind  that I could not go to sleep after   for it was not in the con    fusion of common dreams  I saw everything distinctly and regu    larly  as if I was in the very place   and particularly your lady   appeared as plainly to me as she sits there  Lord bless her   And   by the same token  she was dressed in white damask  spick and   span new  and had the most beautiful diamond necklace on that   ever my eyes beheld   and charmingly she looked  I thought          I really do not know what to say to this matter    replied his   lordship  with great deliberation    The visions of the morning hav    ever been held in most repute  for then the mind has recovered   from the fatigues of the preceding day  and is able to exert its    abilities  and look forward into the time to come  There are some   good circumstances  I own  in this dream  I am glad that my wife   was not dressed in colours   that would have been an ill omen     but white is the peculiar garment of success â€” angels are clad in   white â€” and in this case particularly  it may prefigure the episcopal   lawn  as that is an emblematical type of the purity of the episcopal   fimction  and the episcopal and archiepiscopal differ only in degree    As for the necklace  there may be more in that also than is appre    hended  Precious stones are the insignia of dignity  and in the   Jewish priesthood  particularly  were symbolical of the highest         4 J 7MNTTJRES OF 4 QVINBA 145     order   for none of the priests wore them but the supreme or high   priest  whose dignity answered nearly to that of primate with us     andif such further blessings should be the Divine Will  it were   impious and ungrateful to refuse its favours  Perhaps I speak   unintelligibly to you  but the opinions of the learned must be   delivered in their phrase
