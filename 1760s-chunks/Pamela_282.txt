 For that I might say  as they both knew   my story  that I had not wanted both for menaces and temptations  and   had I complied with the one  or been intimidated by the other  I should   not have been what I was       Ah  madam  replied Mrs  Jewkes  I never knew any body like you  and I   think your temper sweeter  since the happy day  than before  and that    if possible  you take less upon you       Why  a good reason  said I  may be assigned for that  I thought myself   in danger  I looked upon every one as my enemy  and it was impossible   that I should not be fretful  uneasy  jealous  But when my dearest   friend had taken from me the ground of my uneasiness  and made me quite   happy  I should have been very blamable  if I had not shewn a satisfied   and easy mind  and a temper that should engage every one s respect and   love at the same time  if possible  And so much the more  as it was   but justifying  in some sort  the honour I had received  For the fewer   enemies I made myself  the more I engaged every one to think  that my   good benefactor had been less to blame in descending as he has done       This way of talking pleased them both very much  and they made me many   compliments upon it  and wished me always to be happy  as  they said  I   so well deserved       We were thus engaged  when my master  and his sister and her nephew    came in  and they made me quite alive  in the happy humour in which they   all returned  The two women would have withdrawn  but my master said    Don t go  Mrs  Worden  Mrs  Jewkes  pray stay  I shall speak to you   presently  So he came to me  and  saluting me  said  Well  my dear love    I hope I have not trespassed upon your patience  by an absence longer   than we designed  But it has not been to your disadvantage  for though   we had not your company  we have talked of nobody else but you       My lady came up to me  and said  Ay  child  you have been all our   subject  I don t know how it is  but you have made two or three good   families  in this neighbourhood  as much your admirers  as your friend   here       My sister  said he  has been hearing your praises  Pamela  from half   a score mouths  with more pleasure than her heart will easily let her   express       My good Lady Davers s favour  said I  and the continuance of yours    sir  would give me more pride than that of all the rest of the world put   together       Well  child  said she  proud hearts don t come down all at once  though   my brother  here  has this day set mine a good many pegs lower than I   ever knew it  But I will say  I wish you joy with my brother  and so   kissed me       My dear lady  said I  you for ever oblige me   I shall now believe   myself quite happy  This was all I wanted to make me so   And I hope I   shall always  through my life  shew your ladyship  that I have the most   grateful and respectful sense of your goodness       But  child  said she  I shall not give you my company when you make your   appearance  Let your own merit make all your Bedfordshire neighbours   your friends  as it has done here  by your Lincolnshire ones  and you ll   have no need of my countenance  nor any body s else       Now  said her nephew   tis my turn  I wish you joy with all my soul    madam  and  by what I have seen  and by what I have heard   fore Gad  I   think you have met with no more than you deserve  and so all the company   says  where we have been  And pray forgive all my nonsense to you       Sir  said I  I shall always  I hope  respect as I ought  so near a   relation of my good Lord and Lady Davers  and I thank you for your kind   compliment       Gad  Beck  said he  I believe you ve some forgiveness too to ask
