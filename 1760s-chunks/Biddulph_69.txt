master was yet stirring  The poor girl looked aghast  He is gone away on horseback  madam  said she  almost two hours ago  and he ordered his man to put up some linnen and a few other things in a small portmanteau  I believe he means not to return to night  for he bid me to deliver this letter to you  I opened the letter with trembling hands  from whence I received my doom in the following words   ‘You have broken your faith with me  in seeing the man whom I forbad you to see  and whom you so solemnly promised to avoid  As you have betrayed my confidence in this particular  I can no longer rely on your prudence or your fidelity  Whatever your designs may be  it will be less to my dishonour if you prosecute them from under your husband’s roof  I therefore give you till this day se’nnight to consider of a place for your future abode  for one house must no more contain two people  whose hearts are divided  Our children remain with me  and the settlement which was made on you in marriage  shall be appropriated to your separate use   ‘I have left home to avoid expostulations  nor shall I return to it till I hear you have removed yourself  Spare the attempt of a justification  which can only aggravate the resentment of your already too much injured husband ’  I have for a while suppressed the tumult in my soul  to give you    this shocking letter   O my Cecilia  What a wretched lot is thy unhappy friend’s  To be neglected  forsaken  despised  by a husband that I love  Yet I could bear that  but to be suspected  accused too  to be at once the miserable object of jealousy and scorn  Surely they know nothing of the human heart  who say that jealousy cannot subsist without affection  I have a fatal proof to the contrary  Mr Arnold loves me not  yet doubts my honour  Cruel  mean  detestable suspicion  Oh that vile woman  ’tis she has done this  like a persecuting dæmon she urges on the ruin which she set on foot   What can I do  Whither can I fly  I cannot remain here any longer  my presence banishes Mr Arnold from his home  If I go to my mother under such circumstances  it will break her heart  yet she must know it  I must not wait to be turned out of my own doors  That thought is not to be borne  I will go this instant  no matter whither   September 15  God preserve me in my senses  I have passed two days and two nights I know not how  in silence and without food  Patty tells me  But I think I am a little recovered  I will write to my mother  and beg of her to open her arms to receive her miserable child  I am collected enough  and know what to say   I had just dispatched my letter  incoherent as it is  and blotted with my tears  when Patty brought me one that had come by the post  I knew my dear mother’s hand on the superscription  and kissed it before I opened it  See  my sister  how the tenderest of parents write to her unhappy child  whom she fondly believes to be the darling of her husband  and blessed with domestic felicity   My beloved Sidney   I find age and infirmities are advancing a pace upon me  My last illness shook me severely  and has left a memorandum of what I may expect in the next visit it makes me  Your family cares are now so much enlarged  that I cannot expect  nor do I desire that you should undertake a journey to Sidney castle to pay me a short visit  yet  my dear  as you are the comfort of my age  I cannot  in the present precarious state of my health  bear to be at such a distance from you  while God permits me strength I will lay hold of his bounty  and endeavour to get to London  You have told me that you are not conveniently    circumstanced at South park as to room  I will not therefore incommode you  but shall content myself with waiting your arrival in town  at your house in St  James’s street  but do not hasten your departure from the country on this account  I am in no immediate danger  my dear  only willing to lay hold of an interval of health  to get nearer to you  If God prolongs my life  what joy will it be to me to spend next winter with my darling  and her dear good Arnold  and to feast my eyes with my lovely grandchildren   If I am called from you  I shall have the comfort of my child’s affectionate hands to close my eyes  and shall leave the world without regret  as I have lived to see my Sidney happy in the arms of a good man  who will supply the loss of parents  and unite in himself those tender ties which nature must soon dissolve   My prayers for yours  and my dear son’s prosperity  I never fail to offer up to Heaven  Your brother
