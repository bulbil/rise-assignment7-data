next morning for   â  wine and brandy for the occasion      My new master was a striking instance of the inconsistency of   life  and the hypocrisy of the human heart  he had for many   years kept one of the most notorious brothel taverns in the town     but not content with this public insult to the laws  in defiance of   every sense of shame  he at the same time professed himself a   reformer of reUgion  and while the grossest scenes of riot and   debauchery were carrying on openly in hie house  was chanting   hymns in a conventicle  and groaning in spirit  for the wickedness   of the times  with a face as meagre and mortified as the picture of   famine  I see you wonder at such a palpable contradiction   but   that proceeds from ignorance of life  every view of which shows   instances as gross as this   the gaming devotee  the pensioned   patriot  and the drunken priest  being equally offensive to common   sense and reason  As for my new master  he had as powerful   motives for his conduct as the greatest of them aU  Poverty made   him  in his early youth  turn pander to such a house as he now   kept  when the demure sanctity of his looks screened him so   effectually from suspicion  that he was able to make acquaintances   in families  and accompUsh seductions  which no other of his trade   dared to attempt  By these means  he soon acquired a sum of   money suflScient to set up this house for himself   when his   character immediately brought him into business  that in a little   time made his fortune   but  for this success he was chiefly indebted   to a master stroke of superior genius   for  having observed iu the   mystery of his profession  that there is no private sinner like a   public saint  as soon as he thus arose above the drudgery of   business  and  from porter  became master of a tavern  he asso    ciated himself with a set of reformers  who went preaching up and   down the town  at whose meetings he had an opportunity of   fimding out new faces for his best customers  and making ac    quaintances with the leaders  who  observing his discretion  soon   admitted him into their mystery  and made his house the scene   of their secret meetings  to settle their business  laugh at the   follies they lived by  and practise the vices which they preached   against  Such success might be thought to have satisfied his   avarice  but the habit has taken such hold of him that he cannot   desist  and he now does from inohnation  what was at first the   effect of necessity      I should not have dwelt so long upon this character  but that it   serves to explain the ways of the world  and prove the folly of an   opinion  generally received among men  that they can change   their course of hfe whenever they please  and as soon as their   end is answered  and they have heaped up a fortune  by the   iniquity of a profession  quit it at once  and live virtuously upon   the earnings of vice      The evening after I came into his possession  the high priest of   the conventicle  called upon him  to spend an hour in spiritual     1 George Whitefield  1714 1787   the Methodist  who was in England   now between his third and his final journey to America          168 ADVENTUBES OF A GUINEA     conversation  After examining into his progress in grace  and the   increase of his faith  and assurance of election  for such is the   power of custom  and the pleasure of cheating the world  that they   practise the art even upon each other  he to d him that he had a   most particular occasion for his most private i om that evening     For   said he  shaking him by the hand   my friend  as I have   found by experience that the only way to foil the devil Is at his   own weapons  I have appointed Momns  the ballad singer    whose   attack upon me has made such a noise  to meet me here this   evening  and make up the afiair over a glass of wine          In truth    answered my master  a good deal surprised    your   reverence s meekness and patience must needs be very great   or   you could not bear ever to mention him  in any degree of Christian   charity and benevolence  after so outrageous and gross an attack   as he has made upon you
