nor did he forget the sweet sound of mooring and unmooring ships in the river  and the pleasing objects on the other side of the Thames  displayed in the oozy docks and cabbage gardens of Rotherhithe  Sir Launcelot was not insensible to the beauties of this landscape  but  his pursuit lying another way  he contented himself with a less enchanting situation  and Crowe accompanied him out of pure friendship   At night  Mr  Clarke arrived at our hero s house with tidings that were by no means agreeable  He told him  that Clump had left a letter for Dolly  informing her  that his master  Squire Darnel  was to set out early in the morning for Yorkshire  but he could give no account of her lady  who had the day before been conveyed  he knew not whither  in a hackney coach  attended by her uncle and an ill looking fellow  who had much the appearance of a bailiff or turnkey  so that he feared she was in trouble   Sir Launcelot was deeply affected by this intimation  His apprehension was even roused by a suspicion that a man of Darnel s violent temper and unprincipled heart might have practised upon the life of his lovely niece  but  upon recollection  he could not suppose that he had recourse to such infamous expedients  knowing as he did  that an account of her would be demanded at his hands  and that it would be easily proved he had conveyed her from the lodging in which she resided   His first fears now gave way to another suggestion  that Anthony  in order to intimidate her into a compliance with his proposals  had trumped up a spurious claim against her  and  by virtue of a writ  confined her in some prison or spunging house  Possessed with this idea  he desired Mr  Clarke to search the sheriff s office in the morning  that he might know whether any such writ had been granted  and he himself resolved to make a tour of the great prisons belonging to the metropolis  to inquire  if perchance she might not be confined under a borrowed name  Finally  he determined  if possible  to apprise her of his place of abode  by a paragraph in all the daily papers  signifying that Sir Launcelot Greaves had arrived at his house near Golden Square   All these resolutions were punctually executed  No such writ had been taken out in the sheriff s office  and therefore our hero set out on his jail expedition  accompanied by Mr  Clarke  who had contracted some acquaintance with the commanding officers in these garrisons  in the course of his clerkship and practice as an attorney  The first day they spent in prosecuting their inquiry through the Gate House  Fleet  and Marshalsea  the next day they allotted to the King s Bench  where they understood there was a great variety of prisoners  There they proposed to make a minute scrutiny  by the help of Mr  Norton  the deputy marshal  who was Mr  Clarke s intimate friend  and had nothing at all of the jailor  either in his appearance or in his disposition  which was remarkably humane and benevolent towards all his fellow creatures   The knight having bespoke dinner at a tavern in the Borough  was  together with Captain Crowe  conducted to the prison of the King s Bench  which is situated in St  George s Fields  about a mile from the end of Westminster Bridge  and appears like a neat little regular town  consisting of one street  surrounded by a very high wall  including an open piece of ground  which may be termed a garden  where the prisoners take the air  and amuse themselves with a variety of diversions  Except the entrance  where the turnkeys keep watch and ward  there is nothing in the place that looks like a jail  or bears the least colour of restraint  The street is crowded with passengers  Tradesmen of all kinds here exercise their different professions  Hawkers of all sorts are admitted to call and vend their wares as in any open street of London  Here are butchers  stands  chandlers  shops  a surgery  a tap house  well frequented  and a public kitchen  in which provisions are dressed for all the prisoners gratis  at the expense of the publican  Here the voice of misery never complains  and  indeed  little else is to be heard but the sounds of mirth and jollity   At the farther end of the street  on the right hand  is a little paved court  leading to a separate building  consisting of twelve large apartments  called state rooms  well furnished and fitted up for the reception of the better sort of Crown prisoners  and  on the other side of the street  facing a separate division of ground  called the common side  is a range of rooms occupied by prisoners of the lowest order  who share the profits of a begging box  and are maintained by this practice  and some established funds of charity  We ought also to observe  that the jail is provided with a neat chapel  in which a clergyman  in consideration of a certain salary  performs divine service every Sunday   Our adventurer  having searched the books  and perused the
