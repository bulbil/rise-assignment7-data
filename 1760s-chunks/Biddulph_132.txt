former  the latter was discovered to be in a very dangerous way  and required the immediate assistance of a surgeon  You may be sure poor Main was not the person pitched upon to attend her  another was called in  of less skill  but not so obnoxious to the family   By this bungler  she was tortured for near three months  at the end of which time  through improper treatment  the malady was so far increased  that the operator declared the breast must be taken off  as the only possible means of saving her life   The young gentlewoman’s family were all in the greatest affliction  she herself seemed the only composed person amongst them  She appointed the day when she was to undergo this severe trial of her fortitude  it was at the distance of about a week  The surgeon objected to the having it put off so long  but she was peremptory  and at last prevailed   On the evening preceding the appointed day  she conjured her brother in the most earnest manner  to permit Mr Main to be present    at the operation  The brother was unwilling to comply  as he thought it might very much discompose her  but she was so extremely pressing  that he was constrained to yield   The attending surgeon was consulted on the occasion  who having declared  that he had no objection to Mr Main’s being present  that young man was sent for  He had been quite inconsolable at the accounts he received  of the dangerous state in which his mistress was  and went with an aching heart to her brother’s house in the morning   He was introduced into her chamber  where he found the whole chirurgical apparatus ready  The young woman herself was in her closet  but came out in a few minutes  with a countenance perfectly serene  She seated herself in an elbow chair  and desired she might be indulged for a quarter of an hour  to speak a few words to her brother  before they proceeded to their work  Her brother was immediately called to her  when taking him by the hand  she requested him to sit down by her   You have  said she  been a father to me  since I lost my own  I acknowlege your tenderness and your care of me with gratitude  I believe your refusal of me to Mr Main  was from no other motive but your desire of seeing me matched to a richer man  I therefore freely forgive you that only act  in which you ever exercised the authority my father gave you over me  My life  I now apprehend  is in imminent danger  the hazard nearly equal  whether I do  or do not undergo the operation  but as they tell me there is a chance in my favour on one side  I am determined to submit to it   I put it off to this day  on account of its being my birth day  I am now one and twenty  and as the consequences of what I have to go through  may deprive me of the power of doing what I intended  I have spent this morning in making my will  You  brother  have an ample fortune  I have no poor relations  I hope  therefore  I stand justified to the world  for having made Mr Main my heir  Saying this  she pulled a paper from under her gown  which she put into her brother’s hand  that he might read it  It was her will  wrote by herself  regularly signed  and witnessed by two servants of the family   Sir  said she  turning to the other surgeon  as soon as my brother is withdrawn  I am ready for you  You may imagine this had various effects on the different persons concerned  The brother  however displeased he might have been at this act of his sister’s  had too much humanity to make any animadversions on it at that time  He returned    the paper to his sister without speaking  and retired   Poor Main  who had stood at the back of her chair  from his first coming in  had been endeavouring to suppress his tears all the time  but at this proof of his mistress’s tenderness and generosity  it was no longer in his power to do so  and they burst from him with the utmost violence of passion   The other surgeon desired him to compose himself  for that they were losing time  and the lady would be too much ruffled   The heroic young woman  with a smiling countenance  begged of him to dry his eyes  perhaps  said she  I may recover  Then fixing herself firmly in the chair  she pronounced  with much composure  ‘I am ready ’ Two maid servants stood one at each side of her  and the surgeon drew near to do his painful work  He had uncovered her bosom  and taken off the dressings  when Mr Main  casting his eyes at her breast  begged he might have leave to examine it before they proceeded  The other surgeon  with some indignation  said  his doing so was only an unnecessary delay  and had already laid hold of his knife  when Mr Main having looked at it
