   My sword was in my hand  but undrawn        The chariot door remaining open  I was not so ceremonious  as to let down the foot step to take the gentleman out  I seized him by the collar before he could recover himself from the pass he had made at me  and with a jerk  and a kind of twist  laid him under the hind wheel of his chariot        I wrench d his sword from him  and snapp d it  and flung the two pieces over my head        His coachman cried out for his master  Mine threatened his if he stirred  The postilion was a boy  My servant had made him dismount  before he joined the other two  whom I had ordered aloud to endeavour to seize  but my view was only to terrify  wretches  who  knowing the badness of their cause  were before terrified        Sir Hargrave s mouth and face were very bloody  I believe I might hurt him with the pommel of my sword        One of his legs  in his sprawling  had got between the spokes of his chariot wheel  I thought that was a fortunate circumstance for preventing further mischief  and charged his coachman not to stir with the chariot for his master s sake        He cried out  cursed  and swore  I believe he was bruised with the fall  The jerk was violent  So little able to support an offence  Sir Hargrave    196 upon his own principles  should not have been so ready to give it        I had not drawn my sword  I hope I never shall be provoked to do it in a private quarrel  I should not however  have scrupled to draw it  on such an occasion as this  had there been an absolute necessity for it        The Lady  though greatly terrified  had disengaged herself from the man s cloak  I had not leisure to consider her dress  but I was struck with her figure  and more with her terror        I offered my hand  I thought not now of the foot step  any more than I did before  She not of any thing  as it seemed  but her deliverance        Have you not read  Mr  Reeves  Pliny  I think  gives the relation  of a frighted bird  that  pursued by an hawk  flew for protection into the bosom of a man passing by        In like manner your lovely cousin  the moment I returned to the chariot door  instead of accepting of my offered hand  threw herself into my arms —O save me  save me —She was ready to faint  She could not  I believe  have stood        I carried the lovely creature round Sir Hargrave s horses  and seated her in my chariot Be assured  madam  said I  that you are in honourable hands  I will convey you to my sister  who is a young Lady of honour and virtue        She look d out at one window  then at the other  in visible terror  as if fearing still Sir Hargrave  Fear nothing  said I  I will attend you in a moment  I shut the chariot door        I then went backward a few paces  keeping  however  the Lady in my eye  to see what had become of my servants        It seems  that at their first coming up pretty near with Sir Hargrave s horsemen  they presented their pistols       197   What shall we do  Wilkins  or Wilson  or some such name  said one of Sir Hargrave s men to another  all three of them on their defence  Fly for it  answered the fellow  We may swing for this  I see our master down  There may be murder        Their consciences put them to slight        My servants pursued them a little way  but were returning to support their master  just as I had put the lady into my chariot        I saw Sir Hargrave at a distance  on his legs  supported by his coachman  He limped  leaned his whole weight upon his servant  and seemed to be in agonies        I bid one of my servants tell him who I was        He cursed me  and threatened vengeance  He cursed my servants  and still more outrageously his own scoundrels  as he called them        I then stept back to my chariot        Miss Byron had  thro  terror  sunk down at the bottom of it  where she lay panting  and could only say  on my approach  Save me  Save me
