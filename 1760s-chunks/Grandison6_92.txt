life  the LAST or the FIRST  happy  as I hope it will be  you would be willing to deduct the week  the fortnight  that will be carried into the blank space of courtship  by the delay  I hope  my dear Miss Byron  that I shall be able to tell you  years and years after we are ONE  that there is not an hour of those past  or of those to come  that I would abate  or wish to throw into that blank  Permit me so to call it  The days of courtship cannot be our happiest  Who celebrates the day of their first acquaintance  tho  it may be remembred with pleasure —Do not the happy pair date their happiness from the day of marriage  How justly then when hearts are assured  when minds cannot alter  are those which precede it  to be deemed a blank   After all  your chearful compliance with my wishes  is the great desireable  Whatever shall be your pleasure  must determine me  My utmost gratitude will be engaged by the condescension  whenever you shall distinguish the day of the year  distinguished as it will be to the end of my life  that shall give me the greatest blessing of it  and confirm me  For ever Yours  CHARLES GRANDISON     229  LETTER XXXIV  Signor JERONYMO della PORRETTA  To Sir CHARLES GRANDISON     Inclosed in the preceding    Bologna  Oct  18  N  S   I Gave you  my dear Grandison  in mine of the 5th  the copy of a paper written by my sister  which filled us with hopes of her compliance with the wishes of all her family  She took time for deliberation  time was given her  but still she insisted on receiving your next Letters before she came to any resolution  Mrs  Beaumont herself was of opinion  that the dear creature only meditated delay  That also was ours  What  invincibly determined  as she is  to adhere to the resolution she has so greatly taken  can she hope for   said we among ourselves  from the expected Letters  For she had declared herself to be so determined  to my brother Giacomo  who actually assured her of all our consents to an alliance with you  if she repented of that resolution   All this time we offered not to introduce  nor even to name  to her  the Count of Belvedere  Awed by her former calamity  and by an excursiveness of imagination  which at times shewed itself in her words and behaviour  we avoided saying or doing any thing that was likely to disturb her  Giacomo himself  tho  he wanted to return to Naples  had patience with her pretty trifling  beyond our expectation  At last arrived yours of the 29th of September  a   kindly inclosing a copy of yours to her  of the same date  b   We question not but your reply to mine of the 5th current  is on the road  not that the contents will be such as we may hope for  from considerations of our happiness and your own  But these  we thought    230 without waiting for that  would answer the desired end  I will tell you what was said by every one  on the perusal of both   Is this the man  said the General  whom I sometimes so rudely treated  I rejoice that we were reconciled before he left us  I had formed a notion to his disadvantage  that he was capable of art  and hoped to keep his hold in my sister s affections  in view of some turn in his favour  But he is the most singlehearted of men  These two Letters will strengthen our arguments  Clementina  who has more than once declared that she wishes him married to an English woman  cannot now  that she will see there is a woman with whom he thinks he can be happy  wish to stand in his way  These will furnish us with means to attack her in her strongest hold  in her generosity  her delicacy  and will bring to the test her veracity  The contents of these Letters will confirm her before half taken resolution  as in her paper  to oblige us  a   Let Laurana  as the Chevalier says  go into a nunnery  Clementina will marry  or she is a false girl  and the Sforza woman will be disappointed   My mother applauded you  and rejoiced to hear that there is a woman of your own nation who is capable of making you more happy than her daughter could   What difficulties  said the young Marchioness   ever your friend  must a situation so critical have laid him under  A man so humane  And what further difficulties must he have to surmunt  in offering to a woman  whom even Olivia  as he says  admires  a hand that has been refused by another  May this admired woman be propitious to his suit   She must  she must  said the Bishop  If she has a heart disengaged  she cannot refuse a man so accomplished  Jeronymo  hasten to be well  If she favour him  we will all go over
