 and the crocodile pretended to drop a tear   I went to London  in order to sollicit for my pension  As I had formerly been a Roman Catholic  and had not publickly renounced that persuasion  some difficulties arose in the business  and a friend of my deceased husband  who had undertaken the affair for me  happening to be an intimate of Mr Arnold’s  and knowing he had an influence with the secretary at war  endeavoured to interest him in my favour  by representing my situation in the most affecting light he could to him  He kindly undertook to interfere for me  and was as good as his word  but could not surmount the difficulty of the objection which was made to my claim  He happened one morning  unluckily for me  to call in at my friend’s lodgings  to tell him of his ill success  I  impatient to know how my affair went on  had dropped in to inquire about it a few minutes before him  and was sitting in the dining room when Mr Arnold entered  I was in my weeds  and my melancholy looks I believe made Mr Arnold conjecture I was the person for whom he had so kindly concerned himself  He told my friend he was sorry to inform him  that though he had used all means in his power  with regard to the affair in which he had employed him  he found it was impossible to effect the business  and I am the more concerned  said he  turning towards me  as I am afraid this lady is to be the sufferer  My relation said I was the person for whom he had been so good as to intercede  I returned Mr Arnold thanks  not without tears  at the uncomfortable prospect I had before me  for I had then nothing to depend on  but my small jointure in Kent  I was about to take my leave  but observing it rained  desired my friend to give his servant leave to call me a chair  Mr Arnold very politely desired I would permit him to set me down  as his chariot waited at the door  I would have excused myself  but my relation said  ’Tis in his way  child  and since you have no hopes of a pension  you ought to be sparing of chair hire  Mr Arnold very    obligingly offered me his hand  and led me to his chariot  He set me down at my lodgings  and at parting desired permission to wait on me  The fatal consequence of our acquaintance it was impossible for me to foresee  for I never had the least hint given me  either from my own relation or Mr Arnold himself  that he was a married man  till he had so far secured my gratitude  by repeated acts of generosity  that it was impossible for me to refuse him the return he demanded   Too grateful heart  said I  pretending to believe her cant   what a pity thou wert not destined to reward a purer love  But I thought  madam  you really had enjoyed a pension   It was not necessary  she answered  that I should let the world suppose otherwise  I was not at all known when I first came to town  Mr Arnold’s excessive profuseness  quite against my inclination  threw me into a more expensive way of living than before  I found myself obliged to account for it  to the few acquaintance I had  by all the probable means I could devise  For this purpose  I pretended that I had not only obtained a pension  but had also a fortune left me by the death of a relation  This was believed  as nobody troubled their heads to enquire whether it was true or not   Mr Arnold was passionately fond of the country  and always passed his summers there  but as he could not think of parting with me  he was sadly at a loss how to have me near him  without bringing on us both the observation of an inquisitive neighbourhood  such as all country places abound in   if I went down  quite a stranger as I was  into Essex  particularly as he told me there were two families near Arnold abbey  who made it their business to pry into other people’s affairs  These were  a Lady Grimston  a censorious old woman  and the parson of the parish  who was a mighty strict man  of whom Mr Arnold seemed to stand in some awe  He therefore determined against my going to that part of the world  but having casually heard me speak of my little cottage in Kent  where poor Captain Gerrarde and I had lived for two or three years  he asked me whereabouts it was  and was delighted to find it joined his own estate at South Park  and was within a mile of his house  He begged of me to go down to my own house  which he insisted on furnishing elegantly for me  and obliged me also to keep a chariot  I  tho’ unwillingly  found myself under a necessity of complying  About a fortnight after I was settled at Ashby  Mr Arnold and his family came down  then it was that  for the first time  I saw his lady  I went to pay
