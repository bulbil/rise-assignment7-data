 and   some  perhaps  in the same habit as yourself  this will direct my   search  prevent my being deceived by appearances  which otherwise I   might be  and prophanely pay my worship to some other  instead of the   real goddess of my soul        This was the method he took to ingratiate himself into the favour of   his mistress  and it had the effect  if not to make her love him  at   least to make her charmed with this new conquest  much more than she had   been with several of her former ones  though ever so much deserving her   esteem       In the midst of these gay scenes  however  Mr  Trueworth came frequently   into her head  To find he was in town  made her flatter herself that he   lingered here on her account  and that  in spite of all his resolution    he had not courage to leave the same air she breathed in  she fancied    that if she could meet him  or any accident throw him in her way  she   should be able to rekindle all his former flames  and render him as much   her slave as ever  With this view she never went abroad without casting   her eyes about  in search of him  nay  she sometimes even condescended   to pass by the house where he was lodged  in hopes of seeing him either   going in or out  or from some one or other of the windows  but chance   did not befriend her inclinations this way  nor put it in her power   again to triumph over a heart  the sincerity of which she had but too   ill treated  when devoted to her       In the mean time  Mr  Goodman  in spite of the perplexities his own   affairs involved him in  could not help feeling a great concern for   those of Miss Betsy  he knew that Mr  Trueworth had desisted his visits   to her  that she had got a new lover  who he could not find had   consulted the permission of any one but herself to make his addresses to   her  the late hours she kept  seldom coming home till some hours after   the whole family  except the servant who sat up for her  were in bed    gave him also much matter of uneasiness  and he thought it his duty to   talk seriously to her on all these points       He began with asking her how it happened  that he had not seen Mr    Trueworth for so long a time  to which she replied  with the utmost   indifference  that she took some things ill from that gentleman  and   that  perhaps  he might have some subject of complaint against her     Therefore   said she   as our humours did not very well agree  it was   best to break off conversation        He then questioned her concerning Mr  Munden   I hope   said he   you   have taken care to inform yourself as to his character and   circumstances     No  truly  Sir   answered she  with the same careless   air as before   as I never intend to be the better or the worse for   either  I give myself no pain about what he is   Mr  Goodman shook his   head  and was going to reason with her on the ill consequences of such   a behaviour  when some company coming in  broke off  for a time  all   farther discourse between them                CHAPTER XX       Shews Miss Betsy left entirely to her own management  and the cause of   it  with some other particulars          Mr  Goodman  who had been a little vexed at being interrupted in the   remonstrances he thought so highly necessary should be made to Miss   Betsy  took an opportunity of renewing them the next morning  in the   strongest expressions he was master of       Miss Betsy  with all her wit  had little to say for herself in answer to   the serious harangue made to her by Mr  Goodman on her present fashion   of behaviour  her heart avowed the justice of his reproofs  but her   humour  too tenacious of what pleased itself  and too impatient of   control  would not suffer her to obey the dictates either of his or her   own reason  She knew very well the tender regard he had for her  on the   account of her deceased father  and that all he spoke was calculated for   her good  but then it was a good she was not at present ambitious of   attaining  and thought it
