gave me patience and presence of mind enough to withdraw immediately  and I thanked my stars a thousand times for the happy   172 discovery  by which I resolved to profit so much  as to abandon all thoughts of marriage for the future   CHAP  XXI    Squire Gawky comes to lodge with my master—is involved in a troublesome affair  out of which he is extricated by me—he marries my master s daughter—they conspire against me—I am found guilty of theft—discharged—deserted by my friends—I hire a room in St  Giles s—where  by accident  I find the lady to whom I made my addresses  in a miserable condition—I relieve her   WHILE I enjoyed myself at large in this temper of mind  Mr  Lavement let his first floor to my countryman and acquaintance  Squire Gawky  who by this time had got a lieutenancy in the army  and such a martial ferocity in his appearance  that I was afraid he would remember what had happened between us in Scotland  and atone for his breach of appointment then  by his punctuality now  but whether he had actually forgot me  or was willing to make me believe so  he betrayed not the least symptom of recognition at sight of me  and I remained quite cured of my apprehension  though I had occasion not long after to be convinced  that howsoever his externals might be altered  he was at   173 bottom the same individual Gawky whom I have already described —For coming home late one night from the house of a patient  I heard a noise in the street  and as I approached  perceived two gentlemen in custody of three watchmen  The prisoners  who seemed to be miserably disfigured with dirt  complained bitterly of the loss of their hats and wigs  and one of them  whom by his tongue I knew to be a Scotchman  lamented most piteously  offering a guinea for his liberty  which the watchman refused  alledging that one of his companions was wounded grievously  and that he must stand to the consequence —My prejudice in favour of my native country was so strong  that I could not bear to see any body belonging to it in distress  and therefore  with one blow of my faithful cudgel  knocked down the watchman who had hold of the person for whom I was chiefly concerned —He no sooner sound himself disengaged  than he betook himself to his heels  and left me to maintain the dispute as I should think proper  and indeed I came off but scurvily  for before I could avail myself of my speed  I received a blow on the eye  from one of the other two  that had well nigh deprived me of the use of that organ  however  I made shift to get home  where I was informed of captain Gawky s being robb d and abused by a company of foot pads  and was ordered by my master to prepare an emollient glyster and paregorick draught  in order to allay and compose the ferment of his spirits  occasioned by the barbarous treatment he had undergone  while he took twelve ounces of blood from him immediately —When I enquired into the particulars of this adventure  and understood by the servant  that he came in just before   174 me  without hat and wig  I made no scruple of believing him to be the person I had released  and was confirmed in that belief upon hearing his voice  to which  before that event  I had been so long a stranger  My eye being considerably swelled and inflamed  I could not reflect upon my enterprise without cursing my own folly  and even resolving to declare the truth of the whole story  in order to be revenged on the cowardly wretch  for whom I had suffered  Accordingly  next day  after he had told  in presence of my master  his wife and daughter  who came to visit him  a thousand lies concerning the prowess he had shewn in making his escape  I ventured to explain the mystery  and calling in the evidence of my contused eye  upbraided him with cowardice and ingratitude —Gawky was so astonished at this discourse  that he could not answer one word  and the rest of the company stared at one another  till at length my mistress repremanded me for my insolent behaviour  and threatened to turn me away for my presumption —Upon which  Gawky  having recollected himself  observed  as the young man might have mistaken another person for him  he could forgive his insinuations  more especially as he seemed to have suffered for his civility  but advised me to be more certain in my conjectures for the future  before I ventured to publish them to the prejudice of any man —Miss applauded the captain s generosity in pardoning one who had so villainously aspersed him  and I began to imagine her praise was not at all disinterested —But the apothecary  who perhaps had more penetration  or less partiality than his wife and daughter  differed from them in his sentiments of the matter  and expressed   175 himself to me in the shop in this manner     Ah mon pauvre Roderique  you ave more of de veracite dan of de prudence—bot mine vife and dater be diablement sage  and Mons  le capitaine un fanfaron  pardieu  —  This elogium on his wife and
