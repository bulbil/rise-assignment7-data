not but at his next return all those now in his power   would meet the same fate  tho  the generous king of Sweden had sent back   the Muscovites he had taken  by 1500 and 2000 at a time   This  however    may be said in favour of the czar  that by the many attempts he made to   civilize his barbarous subjects  it must be supposed he would have been   glad to have imitated this generosity  had it been confident with his   safety  but the case had this difference  Charles XII  feared not the   number of the Muscovites  but the czar feared the courage of the Swedes       What also increased the affliction of these gentlemen  was  that being   debarred from all intelligence  they could hear nothing of their king    whom each of them loved with a kind of filial affection and   duty   Horatio and two others had been witnesses of the extreme danger   in which they left him  and tho  at the time they were seized he had   killed thirteen or fourteen Muscovites with his own hand  and they   perceived general Dardoff had come up to his relief  yet they could not   be certain of his safety  till at length the sweet conditioned Edella   perceiving the despair they were in on this account  informed them that   his majesty was not only well  but as successful as ever  that he had   passed far into Ukrania  had defeated the Muscovites in five battles    and so far reduced the czar  that he had condescended to make some   overtures of peace  which having been rejected  it was the common   opinion  that in a very short time the Swedes would enter Moscow  and   become arbiters of Russia as they had been of Poland       Adequate to their late grief was their satisfaction at this joyful   news   Horatio was transported above his companions  and threw himself   at the feet of the fair intelligencer  but she desired they would all of   them moderate their contentment so far as to hinder the guards  who had   the care of them  from perceiving it  because  said she  it might not   only draw on yourselves worse treatment  but also render me suspected of   being against the interest of a court  on which my fate has reduced me   to become a dependant       Horatio  as well as the others  assured her he would take care to manage   the felicity she had bestowed upon them  so as not to be any way   prejudicial to her  and she took her leave  promising to be with them   again in a few days  and bring them farther information  a courier from   the camp  she said  being expected every hour       But while this compassionate lady was pleasing herself  by giving all   the ease in her power to the distressed  the cruel Mattakesa was   plotting her destruction   She had several of her kindred  and a great   many acquaintance in the army  who were in considerable posts  to all of   whom she exclaimed against the loose behaviour  as she termed it  of   Edelia  and represented her charities to the prisoners as the effects of   a wanton inclination   this she doubted not but would come to prince   Menzikoff s ears  and perhaps incense him enough to cause her to be   privately made away with  for as she imagined nothing less than the most   amorous intercourse between her and Horatio  she thought it unadvisable   to declare the passion she had for him  till a rival so formidable  by   the advantages she had over her in youth and beauty  should be removed       This base woman therefore impatiently waited the arrival of the next   courier  to find how far her stratagem had succeeded  and the moment she   heard he had delivered his dispatches  flew to the apartment of Edella    in hopes of being informed of what she so much desired to know       She was not altogether deceived in her expectations  she found that lady   drowned in tears  with a letter lying open before her  and on her   enquiring  with a shew of the utmost concern  the motives of her grief    the other  who looked on her as her real friend  replied  alas    Mattakesa  I have cruel enemies  I cannot guess for what cause  for   willingly I never gave offence to any one   but see  continued she  how   barbarously they have abused my innocence  and represented actions   which  heaven knows  were influenced only by charity and compassion as   the worst of crimes  with these words she gave her the letter which she   had just received from the prince
