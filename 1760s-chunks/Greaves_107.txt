found her heart incapable of disguise or dissimulation  frank  generous  and open  susceptible of the most tender impressions  glowing with a keen sense of honour  and melting with humanity  A youth of his sensibility could not fail of being deeply affected by such attractions  The nearer he approached the centre of happiness  the more did the velocity of his passion increase  Her uncle still remained insensible as it were in the arms of death  Time seemed to linger in its lapse  till the knight was inflamed to the most eager degree of impatience  He communicated his distress to Aurelia  he pressed her with the most pathetic remonstrances to abridge the torture of his suspense  He interested Mrs  Kawdle in his behalf  and  at length  his importunities succeeded  The banns of marriage were regularly published  and the ceremony was performed in the parish church  in the presence of Dr  Kawdle and his lady  Captain Crowe  Lawyer Clarke  and Mrs  Dolly Cowslip   The bride  instead of being disguised in tawdry stuffs of gold and silver  and sweating under a harness of diamonds  according to the elegant taste of the times  appeared in a negligee of plain blue satin  without any other jewels than her eyes  which far outshone all that ever was produced by the mines of Golconda  Her hair had no other extraneous ornament than a small sprig of artificial roses  but the dignity of her air  the elegance of her shape  the sweetness and sensibility of her countenance  added to such warmth of colouring  and such exquisite symmetry of features  as could not be excelled by human nature  attracted the eyes and excited the admiration of all the beholders  The effect they produced in the heart of Sir Launcelot was such a rapture as we cannot pretend to describe  He made his appearance on this occasion in a white coat and blue satin vest  both embroidered with silver  and all who saw him could not but own that he alone seemed worthy to possess the lady whom Heaven had destined for his consort  Captain Crowe had taken off a blue suit of clothes strongly guarded with bars of broad gold lace  in order to honour the nuptials of his friend  He wore upon his head a bag wig  a la pigeon  made by an old acquaintance in Wapping  and to his side he had girded a huge plate hilted sword  which he had bought of a recruiting serjeant  Mr  Clarke was dressed in pompadour  with gold buttons  and his lovely Dolly in a smart checked lutestring  a present from her mistress   The whole company dined  by invitation  at the house of Dr  Kawdle  and here it was that the most deserving lovers on the face of the earth attained to the consummation of all earthly felicity  The captain and his nephew had a hint to retire in due time  Mrs  Kawdle conducted the amiable Aurelia  trembling  to the marriage bed  our hero  glowing with a bridegroom s ardour  claimed the husband s privilege  Hymen lighted up his brightest torch at Virtue s lamp  and every star shed its happiest influence on their Heaven directed union   Instructions had been already despatched to prepare Greavesbury Hall for the reception of its new mistress  and for that place the new married couple set out next morning  according to the plan which had been previously concerted  Sir Launcelot and Lady Greaves  accompanied by Mrs  Kawdle and attended by Dolly  travelled in their own coach  drawn by six dappled horses  Dr  Kawdle  with Captain Crowe  occupied the doctor s post chariot  provided with four bays  Mr  Clarke had the honour to bestride the loins of Bronzomarte  Mr  Ferret was mounted upon an old hunter  Crabshaw stuck close to his friend Gilbert  and two other horsemen completed the retinue  There was not an aching heart in the whole cavalcade  except that of the young lawyer  which was by turns invaded with hot desires and chilling scruples  Though he was fond of Dolly to distraction  his regard to worldly reputation  and his attention to worldly interest  were continually raising up bars to a legal gratification of his love  His pride was startled at the thought of marrying the daughter of a poor country publican  and he moreover dreaded the resentment of his uncle Crowe  should he take any step of this nature without his concurrence  Many a wishful look did he cast at Dolly  the tears standing in his eyes  and many a woful sigh did he utter   Lady Greaves immediately perceived the situation of his heart  and  by questioning Mrs  Cowslip  discovered a mutual passion between these lovers  She consulted her dear knight on the subject  and he catechised the lawyer  who pleaded guilty  The captain being sounded as to his opinion  declared he would be steered in that  as well as every other course of life  by Sir Launcelot and his lady  whom he verily revered as being of an order superior to the ordinary race of mankind  This favourable response being obtained from the sailor  our hero took an opportunity on the road  one day after dinner  in presence of the whole company  to accost the lawyer in these words   My good friend Clarke
