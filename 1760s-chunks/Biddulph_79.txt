so full of my own reflections  on the interest I take in this affair  that I have been forgetful of how much more moment it may be to you  Heaven grant that your husband may think of making himself amends  in returning to a faithful and amiable wife  for the loss of a deceitful  jilting mistress  Surely this event must open his eyes  or he deserves to lose them  I hope to embrace you in London in a very little time  till then  believe me   ‘My dear Mrs Arnold   ‘Your most assured friend and servant   V—— hall  Nov  12‘A V ’  Well  my Cecilia  what say you to this  Are you not as much surprized as I am  Mr Faulkland to emerge at last the favoured gallant of Mrs Gerrarde  Prodigious  I confess  my dear  I am so selfish as not to participate with Lady V—— in her uneasiness on this occasion  That Mrs Gerrarde flies from my husband  I am glad  and that Mr Faulkland is the very man she chose to fly with  I am still gladder  he  of all men living  I would have wished  though least expected  to be the person  This explains every thing that is passed  Surely  as Lady V—— says  this must open Mr Arnold’s eyes  I can now discover a double reason for my poor deluded man’s having his imagination poisoned with jealousy  Mrs Gerrarde did not aim singly at separating my husband and me  this  perhaps  was but a secondary consideration  or who knows whether it was at all intended  But she most certainly designed to secure herself against all suspicions  by making me the object of them  and effectually to blind Mr Arnold  persuaded him  that Mr Faulkland’s visits  made to her  were only in the hope of seeing me   Let her views have been what they would  this event was beyond my hopes  Some glimmerings of comfort begin to break in upon me  Methinks my heart feels much lighter than it did  How Sir George will stare at this account  My mother will lift up her eyes  but she has no opinion of Mr Faulkland’s morals  and therefore will be the less surprized  I pity Miss Burchell  this is an irremediable bar to her    hopes  faint and unsupported as they were before  they must now entirely vanish   November 24  I gave you a copy of Lady V——’s letter  while the subject was warm at my heart  and before I shewed it to any one  but my mother and my brother have now both seen it  My mother  just as I expected   without any great emotions of surprize  only exclaimed against their wickedness  but said  she could not help rejoicing in it  as I  she hoped  would derive happiness from their accumulated crimes  Sir George read the letter twice over before he uttered a word  and then said  It was strange  upon his soul  most unaccountable  and that either Faulkland was run mad  or that woman had bewitched him  When he was with me  said he  at Sidney Castle  he did not so much as mention her  I asked him  whether he was acquainted with Mr Arnold  for I had written him word of your marriage  when he was abroad   He told me  he had seen both you and him  two or three times  at Lord V——’s  but that as he did not wish to renew his acquaintance with you  he had never visited your husband  I presume he was not then a stranger to his connection with Mrs Gerrarde  at least to the conjectures of the neighbourhood upon it  but as it was then but a matter of opinion  and he knew not of the difference between you and your husband  ’tis probable he did not chuse to disgust me more against my brother in law  by hinting at this circumstance  He expressed great acknowlegements to my mother  when I told him of the notice she had taken of Miss Burchell  though  he said  he found  from my account of your marriage  that she had deferred her conference with that young lady  till it was too late for her testimony to be of any service to him  As I knew nothing of what had passed between my mother and Miss Burchell  I could give him no satisfaction on that subject  and the recollection of past transactions being equally disagreeable to us both  I avoided ever mentioning them after our first conversation  nor do I remember that Mrs Gerrarde’s name occurred once   My mother now began to exult over Sir George  and took advantage of the surprize and consternation that Lady V——’s letter had thrown him into  This is your boasted friend  said she  the man whose honour and generosity were not to be questioned  and whose utmost crime was a youthful folly that he was surprized into with a silly girl  I am pleased  however  that this has proved I was not so    grossly mistaken in believing him a loose man  Mrs Gerrarde is the fittest mate for him  and I am glad they are gone together   Sir George was too much mortified at the
