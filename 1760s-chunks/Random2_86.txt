wherewithal to support her—And I am credibly informed of your incapacity that way —Nay    257 I will confess  that  urged by this consideration  I have actually sent notice to her brother  of the progress I suspect you have made in her affection  and desired him to take his precautions accordingly  —  Alarmed and provoked at this information  I told his lordship  that I did not see how he could reconcile that piece of conduct with his profession of open dealing  and flung away from him in a passion     As I walked homeward  in hopes of hearing from my mistress as usual by means of Miss Williams  I was surprized with the waving of a handkerchief  from the window of a coach and six that passed by me at full speed  and upon further observation  I saw a servant on horse back riding after it  who  I knew by his livery  belonged to the Squire —Thunderstruck with this discovery  the knowledge of my misfortune rushed all at once upon my reflection  I guessed immediately that the signal was made by the dear hand of Narcissa  who being hurried away in consequence of Lord Quiverwit s message to her brother  had no other method of relating her distress  and imploring my assistance —Frantick with this conjecture  I run to my lodging  snatched my pistols  and ordered Strap to get post horses  with such incoherence of speech and disorder  that the poor valet  terrified with the suspicion of another duel  instead of providing what I desired  went forthwith to Freeman  who being informed of my behaviour  came streight to my apartment  and conjured me so pathetically to acquaint him with the cause of my uneasiness  that I could not refuse to tell him my happiness was fled with Narcissa  and that I must retrieve   258 her or perish  He represented the madness of such an undertaking  and endeavoured to divert me from it with great strength of friendship and reason  But all his arguments would have been ineffectual  had he not put me in mind of the dependance I ought to have on the love of Narcissa  and attachment of her maid  which could not fail of finding opportunities enow to advertise me of their situation  and at the same time  demonstrated the injury my charmer s reputation must suffer from my precipitate retreat  I was convinced and composed by these considerations  I appeared in publick with an air of tranquility  was well received by the best company in town  and my misfortune taking air  condoled accordingly  while I had the satisfaction of seeing Melinda so universally discountenanced  that she was fain to return to London  in order to avoid the scoffs and censure of the ladies at Bath —But though the hope of hearing from the darling of my soul supported my spirits a little while  I began to be very uneasy  when at the end of several weeks  I found that expectation disappointed —In short  melancholy and despondence took possession of my soul  and repining at that providence  which by acting the stepmother towards me  kept me from the fruition of my wishes  I determined  in a fit of despair  to risk all I had at the gaming table  with a view of acquiring a fortune sufficient to render me independant for life  or of plunging myself into such a state of misery  as would effectually crush every ambitious hope that now tortured my imagination   Actuated by this fatal resolution  I engaged in play  and after some turns of fortune  found myself    259 at the end of three days  worth a thousand pounds  but it was not my intention to stop there  for which cause I kept Strap ignorant of my success  and continued my career  until I was reduced to five guineas  which I would have hazarded also  had I not been ashamed to fall from a bett of two hundred pounds to such a petty sum   Having thus executed my scheme  I went home  amazed to find myself so much at ease  and informed my friend Strap of my mischance  with such calmness  that he imagining I joked  affected to receive the tidings with great equanimity —But both he and I found ourselves mistaken very soon —I had misinterpreted my own stupidity into deliberate resignation  and he had reason to believe me in earnest  when he saw me next morning agitated with the most violent despair  which he endeavoured to alleviate with all the consolation in his power   In one of my lucid intervals  however  I charged him to take a place in the stage coach for London  and in the mean time  pay d my debts in Bath  which amounted to thirty shillings only —Without taking leave of my friends I embarked  Strap having the good fortune to find a return horse  and arrived in town  without having met with any thing remarkable on the road  save that  while we crossed Bagshot Heath  I was seized with a sort of inclination to retrieve my fortune  by laying passengers under contribution  in some such place —My thoughts were so circumstanced at this time  that I should have digested the crime of robbery  so righteously had I concerted my plan  and ventured my life in the   260 execution  had I not been deterred
