in England  as it could from a man of the same or the like ill qualities  in Spain  in France  or in Italy  And why is the Grecian Homer  to this day  so much admired  as he is in all these nations  and in every other nation where he has been read  and will be  to the world s end  but because he writes to nature  And is not the language of nature one language throughout the world  tho  there are different modes of speech to express it by   But I shall go out of my depth  All I mean  and  from the frankness of my own heart  you will expect from me such a declaration  is  that I do not love that a man so nearly perfect  be his motives what they will  should have reserves to such a sister  Don t you think  Lucy  that this seems to be a kind of fault in Sir Charles Grandison  Don t you think  that it would mingle some fear in a sister s Love of him  And should one s Love of so amiable a brother be dashed or allayed with fear  He is said to be a good man  And a good man I dare say he is  What secrets can a good man have  that such a sister  living with him in the same house  and disdaining not  but  on the contrary  priding herself in  the title of her brother s housekeeper  should not be made acquainted with  Will a man so generous look upon her as he would upon a mere housekeeper —Does not confidence engage confidence —And are they not by nature  as well as inclination  friends   But I fancy I am acting the world  in its malevolence  as well as impertinence  That world  which thinks itself affronted by great and superior merit  and takes delight to bring down exalted worth to its own level  But  at least  you will collect from what I have written  an instance of my impartiality  and   361 see  that  tho  bound to Sir Charles by a tie of gratitude which never can be dissolved  I cannot excuse him  if he be guilty of a diffidence and reserve to his generous sister  which she is above shewing to him   If I am allowed to be so happy  as to cultivate this desirable acquaintance  And I hope it is not their way to leave those whom they have relieved and raised  in order to shine upon  and bless only new objects of compassion  then will I closely watch every step of this excellent man  in hope  however  to find him as perfect as report declares him  that I may fearlesly make him my theme  as I shall delight to make his sister my example  And if I were to find any considerable faults in him  never fear  my dear  but my gratitude will enlarge my charity in his favour  But I shall  at the same time  arm my heart with those remembred failings  lest my gratitude should endanger it  and make me a hopeless fool   Now  my uncle  do not be very hard on your niece  I am sure  very sure  that I am not in danger as yet  And indeed I will tell you  by my Lucy  whenever  I find out that I am  Spare  therefore  my dear uncle Selby  all your conjectural constructions   And indeed you should in pity spare me  my dear Sir  at present  for my spirits are still weak  I have not yet forgiven myself for the masquerade affair  especially since Mr  Reeves has hinted to me  that Sir Charles Grandison  as he judges from what he dropt about that foolish amusement  approves not of masquerades  And yet self partiality has suggested several strong pleas in my favour  indeed by way of extenuation only  How my judge  CONSCIENCE  will determine upon those pleas  when counsel has been heard on both sides  I cannot say  Yet I think  that an acquittal from this brother and sister  would go a great way to make my conscience easy   I have not said one half of what I intended to say of this extraordinary man  But having imagined  from   262 the equal Love I have to his admirable sister  that I had found something to blame him for  my impartiality has carried me out of my path  and I know not how to recover it  without going a great way back  Let therefore what I have further to say  mingle in with my future narratives  as new occasions call it forth   But yet I will not suffer any other subject to interfere with that which fills my heart with the praises  the due praises of this worthy brother and sister  to which I intended to consecrate this rambling and very imperfect Letter  And which here I will conclude  with assurances  however needless I hope they are  of duty  Love  and gratitude  where so much due from  Your HARRIET BYRON   LETTER XXXVII  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   Feb  24    25   NOW have I near a week
