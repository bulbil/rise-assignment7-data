changing to one delight  when satiated with another  In nature  it is very different  the glutton  when sated with the full meal  is unqualified to feel the real pleasure of drinking  the drunkard in turn finds few of those transports which lovers boast in enjoyment  and the lover  when cloyed  finds a diminution of every other appetite  Thus  after a full indulgence   189 of any one sense  the man of pleasure finds a languor in all  is placed in a chasm between past and expected enjoyment  perceives an interval which must be filled up  The present can give no satisfaction  because he has already robbed it of every charm  a mind thus left without immediate employment  naturally recurs to the past or the future  the reflector finds that he was happy  and knows that he cannot be so now  he sees that he may yet be happy  and wishes the hour was come  thus every period of his continuance is miserable  except that very short one of immediate gratification  Instead of a life of dissipation  none has more frequent conversations with disagreeable self than he  his enthusiasms are but few and transient  his appetites  like angry creditors  continually making fruitless demands for what he is unable to pay  and the greater his former pleasure  the more strong his regret  the more impatient his expectations  a life of pleasure is therefore the most unpleasing life in the world   Habit has rendered the man of business more cool in his desires  he finds less regret for past pleasures  and less solicitude for those to come  The life he now leads  tho  tainted in some measure with hope  is yet not afflicted so strongly with regret  and is less divided between short lived rapture and lasting anguish  The pleasures he has enjoyed are not so vivid  and those he has to expect cannot consequently create so much anxiety   The philosopher  who extends his regard to all mankind  must have still a smaller concern for   190 what has already affected  or may hereafter affect himself  the concerns of others make his whole study  and that study is his pleasure  and this pleasure is continuing in its nature because it can be changed at will  leaving but few of these anxious intervals which are employed in remembrance or anticipation  The philosopher by this means leads a life of almost continued dissipation  and reflection  which makes the uneasiness and misery of others  serves as a companion and instructor to him   In a word  positive happiness is constitutional  and incapable of encrease  misery is artificial  and generally proceeds from our folly  Philosophy can add to our happiness in no other manner  but by diminishing our misery  it should not pretend to encrease our present stock  but make us oeconomists of what we are possessed of  The great source of calamity lies in regret or anticipation  he  therefore  is most wise who thinks of the present alone  regardless of the past or the future  This is impossible to the man of pleasure  it is difficult to the man of business  and is in some measure attainable by the philosopher  Happy were we all born philosophers  all born with a talent of thus dissipating our own cares  by spreading them upon all mankind   Adieu     191  LETTER XLIV  From Lien Chi Altangi  to Fum Hoam  first president of the Ceremonial Academy  at Pekin  in China   THO  the frequent invitations I receive from men of distinction here might excite the vanity of some  I am quite mortified however when I consider the motives that inspire their civility  I am sent for not to be treated as a friend  but to satisfy curiosity  not to be entertained so much as wondered at  the same earnestness which excites them to see a Chinese  would have made them equally proud of a visit from the rhinoceros   From the highest to the lowest  this people seem fond of sights and monsters  I am told of a person here who gets a very comfortable livelihood by making wonders  and then selling or shewing them to the people for money  no matter how insignificant they were in the beginning  by locking them up close  and shewing for money  they soon became prodigies  His first essay in this way was to exhibiit himself as a wax work figure behind a glass door at a puppet show  Thus keeping the spectators at a proper distance  and having his head adorned with a copper crown  he looked extreamly natural  and very like the life itself  He continued this exhibition with success  till an involuntary fit of sneezing brought him to life before all the spectators  and consequently rendered him for that time as entirely useless  as the peaceable inhabitant of a catacomb     192Determined to act the statue no more  he next levied contributions under the figure of an Indian king  and by painting his face  and counterfeiting the savage howl  he frighted several ladies and children with amazing success  in this manner therefore he might have lived very comfortably  had he not been arrested for a debt that was contracted when he was the figure in wax work  thus his face underwent an involuntary ablution  and he found himself
