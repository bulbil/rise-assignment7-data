marks of distinction unknown in France or England  they have their Clarissimi and Preclarissimi  their Accurat•ssimi and Minutissimi  a Round cap entitles one student to argue  and a Square cap permits another to teach  while a cap with a Tossel  almost sanctifies the head it happens to cover  But where true knowledge is cultivated  these formalities begin to disappear  the ermin d cowl  the solemn beard  and sweeping train are laid aside  philosophers dress  and talk  and think like other men  and lamb skin dressers  and cap makers  and tail carriers  now deplore a literary    157For my own part  my friend  I have seen enough of presuming ignorance  never to venerate wisdom but where it actually appears  I have received literary titles and distinctions myself  and  by the quantity of my own wisdom  know how very little wisdom they can confer  Adieu   LETTER CII  From Lien Chi Altangi  to Fum Hoam  first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin  in China   THE time for the young King s coronation approaches  the great and the little world look forward with impatience  A knight  from the country  who has brought up his family to see  and be seen on this occasion  has taken all the lower part of the house where I lodge  His wife is laying in a large quantity of silks  which the mercer tells her are to be fashionable next season  and Miss  her daughter  has actually had her ears bored previous to the ceremony  In all this bustle of preparation I am considered as mere lumber  and have been shoved up two stories higher to make room for others my landlady seems perfectly convinced are my betters  but whom  before me  she is contented with only calling very good company   The little beau  who has now forced himself into my intimacy  was yesterday giving me a most minute detail of the intended procession  All men are eloquent upon their favourite topic  and this seemed peculiarly adapted to the size and turn of his understanding  His whole mind was blazoned over with a variety of glittering images  coronets    158 escutcheons  lace  fringe  tassels  stones  bugles  and spun glass   Here  cried he  Garter is to walk  and there Rouge Dragon marches with the escutcheons on his back  Here Clarencieux moves forward  and there Blue Mantle disdains to be left behind  Here the Aldermen march two and two  and there the undaunted Champion of England  no way terrified at the very numerous appearance of gentlemen and ladies  rides forward in complete armour  and  with an intrepid air  throws down his glove  Ah  continued he  should any be so hardy as to take up that fatal glove  and so accept the challenge  we should see fine sport  the Champion would shew him no mercy  he would soon teach him all his passes with a witness  However  I am afraid we shall have none willing to try it with him  upon the approaching occasion  for two reasons  first  because his antagonist would stand a chance of being killed in the single combat  and secondly  because if he escapes the Champion s arm  he would certainly be hanged for treason  No  no  I fancy none will be so hardy as to dispute it with a Champion like him inured to arms  and we shall probably see him prancing unmolested away  holding his bridle thus in one hand  and brandishing his dram cup in the other    Some men have a manner of describing  which only wraps the subject in more than former obscurity  thus I was unable  with all my companion s volubility  to form a distinct idea of the intended procession  I was certain  that the inauguration of a King should be conducted with solemnity and religious awe  and I could not be persuaded that there was much solemnity in this description  If this be true  cried I to myself  the people of Europe   159 surely have a strange manner of mixing solemn and fantastic images together  pictures at once replete with burlesque and the sublime  At a time when the King enters into the most solemn compact with his people  nothing surely should be admitted to diminish from the real Majesty of the ceremony  A ludicrous image brought in at such a time throws an air of ridicule upon the whole  It some way resembles a picture I have seen  designed by Albert Durer  where  amidst all the solemnity of that aweful scene  a deity judging  and a trembling world awaiting the decree  he has introduced a merry mortal trundling his scolding wife to hell in a wheel barrow   My companion  who mistook my silence  during this interval of reflection  for the rapture of astonishment  proceeded to describe those frivolous parts of the shew  that mostly struck his imagination  and to assure me  that if I stayed in this country some months longer I should see fine things   For my own part  continued he  I know already of fifteen suits of cloaths  that would stand on one end with gold lace  all designed to be first shewn there  and as for diamonds  rubies  emeralds and pearls
