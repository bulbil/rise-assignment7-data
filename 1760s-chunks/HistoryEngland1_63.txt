and  contrary to all expectation  instantly repaired to York   Fortune seemed to be for Edward  and  marching some troops to London  the citizens immediately declared in his favour  It is surprising to think how one party is seen this day at the head of numerous forces  while the next we behold it abandoned  and the adverse party triumphing without a rival  a strong proof of the fluctuating disposition of the English  Edwrd now commanded a numerous army  while Warwick  and his brother Clarence  were attended by a few  The King  resolving to take the advantage of their weakness  after having defeated a party commanded by Lord Wells  and cut off his head  the usual method of treating the prisoners of either party  he marched to give them battle  In this exigence they had no other course to take  but to embark  in order to screen themselves from impending danger    185 Having arrived safely in France  they now were reconciled to Queen Margaret  their former enemy  and  returning from France  Warwick once more saw himself at the head of no less than sixty thousand men   It was now become Edward s turn to fly the kingdom  and  escaping the dangers of the enemy  of the sea and of pyrates  he landed safely in Holland  Warwick  in the mean time  advanced to London  and once more poor passive Henry was released from prison  and placed upon an useless throne  Warwick was received  among the people  by the name of King maker  a parliament was called  and confirmed Henry s right  but they were now only ministers of the will of the victor   Edward  though an exile in Holland  had many partizans at home  and  after an absence of about nine months  once more landed at Ravenspur  where Henry IV  had landed upon a similar occasion  Though at first he was coldly received by the English  yet his army increased upon its march  and his moderation and seigned humility still added to the number of his partizans  London  at this time  ever ready to admit the most powerful  opened her gates  and Henry was again taken from his throne to be sent back to his old mansion   Warwick at last found his party begin to decline  and Clarence  the King s brother  on whom he had the greatest dependence  changed to the other side  In this state of uncertainty  he knew no other expedient than to hazard a battle  he knew his forces to be inferior  but he was conscious of the superiority of his own generalship  With this resolution he marched from St  Alban s  and  having advanced to Barnet  within ten miles of London  he met Edward  who was marching down   186 with a design to fight him  Warwick and Edward were the two most renowned Generals of their age  and now was to be struck the decisive blow  that was either to fix Edward on the throne  or overthrow his pretensions for ever  The unfortunate Henry was dragged along to be a spectator of the engagement  happy in his natural imbecillity  which seemed to opiate all his afflictions   The battle began early in the morning  and lasted till noon  never did two armies fight with greater obstinacy and bravery  not honour  but life  depended upon the issue of the contest  The example of Warwick inspired his troops with more than common resolution  and the victory  for a while  seemed to declare for him  but his army  by reason of a slight mist  happening to mistake a body of their own forces for that of the enemy  fell furiously upon them  and this fatal error turned the fortune of the day  Warwick did all that experience  conduct  or valour  could suggest  to retrieve the mistake  but in vain  Finding  therefore  all hopes gone  he was resolved to sell his life dearly to the conquerors  and  rushing  on foot as he was  into the midst of his enemies  he fell covered all over with wounds  Thus died the ambitious Warwick  who had made and unmade Kings at pleasure  yet who never seemed to aspire at regal dignity himself  Ten thousand of his army shared the same fate with him  the King having ordered that no quarter should be given   Margaret  who was ever fruitful in resources  was  at this time  returning from France  with her son the Prince of Wales  where she had been negotiating a new supply  She had scarce time to refresh herself from the fatigues of her voyage  when she received the fatal news of the death of   187 the brave Warwick  who was then her only defender  Though she had hitherto bravely withstood all the attacks of fortune  this was too violent a shock for nature to support  her grief now  for the first time  found way in a torrent of tears  and  yielding to her unhappy fate  she took sanctuary in an abbey in Hampshire   She had not been here long  when she found some few friends still willing to assist her fallen hopes  The Duke of Somerset  the Earl of Pembroke  and one or
