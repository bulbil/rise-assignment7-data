enclosed the bank note to his generous  benefactress        Madam   Your humanity is not more ingenious than my       suspicion  In vain you attempt to impose upon me by an       act of generosity  which no person on earth but your       ladyship is capable of committing  Though your name was       not subscribed on the paper  your sentiments were fully       displayed in the contents  which I must beg leave to       restore  with the same sense of gratitude  and for the       same reasons I expressed when last I had the honour to       converse with you upon this subject  Though I am deprived       of my liberty by the villainy and ingratitude of mankind        I am not yet destitute of the other conveniences of life        and therefore beg to be excused for incurring an unnecessary       addition to that load of obligation you have already laid       upon  madam  your ladyship s most devoted  humble servant                                         Peregrine Pickle    Having dressed himself  and repaired to the place of appointment  he  despatched this epistle by the hands of Pipes  who was ordered to leave  it at her ladyship s house  without staying for an answer  and in the  meantime gave directions for dinner  which he and his friend Hatchway  ate very cheerfully in his own apartment  after he had entertained him  with a sight of all the curiosities in the place  During their repast   Jack repeated his kind offers to our adventurer  who declined them with  his former obstinacy  and begged he might be no more importuned on  that subject  but if he insisted upon giving some fresh proofs of his  friendship  he might have an opportunity of exhibiting it in taking  Pipes under his care and protection  for nothing affected him so much as  his inability to provide for such a faithful adherent   The lieutenant desired he would give himself no trouble upon that score   he being  of his own accord  perfectly well disposed to befriend his old  shipmate  who should never want while he had a shilling to spare  But  he began to drop some hints of an intention to fix his quarters in the  Fleet  observing  that the air seemed to be very good in that place  and  that he was tired of living in the country  What he said did not amount  to a plain declaration  and therefore Peregrine did not answer it  as such  though he perceived his drift  and took an opportunity of  describing the inconveniences of the place  in such a manner as   he hoped  would deter him from putting such an extravagant plan in  execution     6 22 15  3 45 PM   This expedient  however  far from answering the end proposed  had a  quite contrary effect  and furnished Hatchway with an argument against  his own unwillingness to quit such a disagreeable place  In all  probability  Jack would have been more explicit with regard to the  scheme he had proposed  if the conversation had not been interrupted by  the arrival of Cadwallader  who never failed in the performance of his  diurnal visit  Hatchway  conjecturing that this stranger might have some  private business with his friend  quitted the apartment  on pretence of  taking a turn  and meeting Pipes at the door  desired his company to  the Bare  by which name the open space is distinguished  where  during  a course of perambulation  these two companions held a council upon  Pickle  in consequence of which it was determined  since he obstinately  persisted to refuse their assistance  that they should take lodgings  in his neighbourhood  with a view of being at hand to minister unto his  occasions  in spite of his false delicacy  according to the emergency of  his affairs   This resolution being taken  they consulted the bar keeper of the  coffee house about lodging  and she directed them to the warden  to whom  the lieutenant  in his great wisdom  represented himself as a kinsman to  Peregrine  who  rather than leave that young gentleman by himself to the  unavoidable discomforts of a prison  was inclined to keep him company   till such time as his affairs could be put in order  This measure he  the more anxiously desired to take  because the prisoner was sometimes  subject to a disordered imagination  upon which occasion he stood in  need of extraordinary attendance  and therefore he  the lieutenant   entreated the warden to accommodate him with a lodging for himself  and his servant  for which he was ready to make any reasonable  acknowledgment
