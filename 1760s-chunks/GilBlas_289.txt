governor of my making did not know what to understand by the hint  and pressed for an explanation  I gave it in full  to his utter astonishment  Neither he nor Baron Steinbach could ever have the slightest suspicion that the government of Valencia was owing to my interest at court  Yet having no reason to doubt the fact  my friend proposed to grant me an annuity of two thousand ducats  in addition to the little farm at Lirias   Hold your hand  Signor Don Alphonso  exclaimed I at this offer  You must not set my avarice afloat again  I am myself a living witness  that fortune may give superfluities to her favourites  but has no competence to bestow  With pleasure will I accept of the estate at Lirias  where my present property will be sufficient for all my wants  Rather than increase my cares with my possessions  I would build a hospital out of my existing funds  Riches are a burden  and it must be a foolish animal that would bear fardels in the manger or the field   While we were talking after this fashion  Den Caesar came in  His joy was not less than his son s at the sight of me  and being informed of the family obligations  he again pressed me to accept of the annuity  which I again refused  When the writings were drawn  the father and son made the assignment their joint act and deed  transferring to me the fee simple  and putting me in immediate possession  My secretary half stared the eyes out of his head  when I told him we lad a landed estate of our own  and how we came by it  What is the value of this little freehold  said he  Five hundred ducats per annum  answered I  and the farm in high cultivation  within a ring fence  I have often been there during my stewardship  There is a small house on the banks of the Guadalaviar  in a little hamlet  surrounded by a charming country   What pleases me better than all  cried Scipio  is that we shall have plenty of sporting  rare living  and excellent wine  Come  master  let us leave this crowded city  and hasten to our hermitage  I long to be there as much as you can do  answered I  but I must first go to the Asturias  My father and mother are not in comfortable circumstances  They shall therefore end their days with me at Lirias  Heaven  perhaps  has thrown this windfall in my way to try my filial duty  and would punish me for the neglect of it Scipio approved my purpose  and urged its speedy execution  Yes  my friend  said I  we will set out as soon as possible  I shall consider it as my dear delight to share the gifts of fortune with the authors of my existence  We shall soon be settled in our country retreat  and then will I write these two Latin verses over the door of my farm house  in letters of gold  for the pious edification of my rustic neighbours   Inveni portum  Spes et fortuna  valete  Sat me lusistis  ludite nunc alios       BOOK THE TENTH       CH  I     Gil Blas sets out for the Asturias  and passes through Valladolid  where he goes to see his old master  Doctor Sangrado  By accident  he comes across Signor Manuel Ordonnez  governor of the hospital   JUST as I was arranging matters to take my departure from Madrid  and go with Scipio to the Asturias  Paul V  gave the Duke of Lerma a cardinal s hat  This pope  wishing to establish the inquisition in the kingdom of Naples  invested the minister with the purple  and by that means hoped to bring King Philip over to so pious and praiseworthy a design  Those who were best acquainted with this new member of the sacred college  thought much like myself  that the church was in a fair way for apostolical purity  after so ghostly an acquisition   Scipio  who would have liked better to see me once more blazing at court  than either cloistered or rusticated  advised me to shew my face at the cardinal s audience  Perhaps  said he  his eminence  finding you at large by the king s order  may think it unnecessary to affect any further displeasure against you  and may even reinstate you in his service  My good friend Scipio  answered I  you seem to forget that my liberty was granted only on condition of making myself scarce in the two Castiles  Besides  can you suppose me so soon inclined to become an absentee from my domain of Lirias  I have told you before  and I tell it you once again  Though the Duke of Lerma should restore me to his good graces  though he should even offer me Don Rodrigo de Calderona s place  I would refuse it  My resolution is taken  I mean to go and find out my parents at Oviedo  and carry them with me to Valencia  As for you  my good fellow  if you repent of having linked your fate with mine  you have only to say so  I am ready to give you half
