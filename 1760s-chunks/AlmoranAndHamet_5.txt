the throne alone  But as change is itself   an evil  and as changes in government are seldom produced without great   confusion and calamity  he applied himself to consider in what manner   the government of ALMORAN and HAMET could be administered  so as most   effectually to blend their characters in their administration  and   prevent the conduct of one from exciting jealousy in the other       After much thought  he determined that a system of laws should be   prepared  which the sons of Solyman should examine and alter till they   perfectly approved  and to which they should then give the sanction of   their joint authority  that when any addition or alteration should be   thought necessary  it should be made in the same manner  and that when   any insuperable difference of sentiment happened  either in this or in   any act of prerogative independent of the laws for regulating the   manners of the people  the kings should refer it to some person of   approved integrity and wisdom  and abide by his determination  OMAR   easily foresaw  that when the opinion of ALMORAN and HAMET should   differ  the opinion of ALMORAN would be established  for there were many   causes that would render ALMORAN inflexible  and HAMET yielding  ALMORAN   was naturally confident and assuming  HAMET diffident and modest    ALMORAN was impatient of contradiction  HAMET was attentive to   argument  and felicitous only for the discovery of truth  ALMORAN also   conceived  that by the will of his father  he had suffered wrong  HAMET    that he had received a favour  ALMORAN  therefore  was disposed to   resent the first appearance of opposition  and HAMET  on the contrary    to acquiesce  as in his share of government  whatever it might be  he   had more than was his right by birth  and his brother had less  Thus    therefore  the will of ALMORAN would probably predominate in the state    but as the same cause which conferred this superiority  would often   prevent contention  OMAR considered it  upon the whole  rather as good   than evil       When he had prepared his plan  therefore  he sent a copy of it  by   different messengers at the same time  both to ALMORAN and HAMET    inclosed in a letter  in which he exprest his sense of obligation to   their father  and his zeal and affection for them  he mentioned the   promise he had made  to devote himself to their service  and the oath he   had taken  to propose whatever he thought might facilitate the   accomplishment of their father s design  with honour to them and   happiness to their people  these motives  which he could not resist   without impiety  he hoped would absolve him from presumption  and   trusting in the rectitude of his intentions  he left the issue to God                CHAP  III          The receipt of this letter threw ALMORAN into another agony of   indignation  he felt again the loss of his prerogative  the offer of   advice he disdained as an insult  to which he had been injuriously   subjected by the will of his father  and he was disposed to reject   whatever was suggested by OMAR  even before his proposal was known  With   this temper of mind he began to read  and at every paragraph took new   offence  he determined  however  not to admit OMAR to the honour of a   conference upon the subject  but to settle a plan of government with his   brother  without the least regard to his advice       A supercilious attention to minute formalities  is a certain indication   of a little mind  conscious to the want of innate dignity  and   felicitous to derive from others what it cannot supply to itself  as the   scrupulous exaction of every trifling tribute discovers the weakness of   the tyrant  who fears his claim should be disputed  while the prince    who is conscious of superior and indisputable power  and knows that the   states he has subjugated do not dare to revolt  scarce enquires whether   such testimonies of allegiance are given or not       Thus  the jealousy of ALMORAN already enslaved him to the punctilios of   state  and the most trifling circumstances involved him in perplexity    or fired him with resentment  the friendship and fidelity of OMAR stung   him with rage  as insolent and intrusive  and though it determined him   to an immediate interview with his brother  yet he was embarrassed how   to procure it  At first he rose  and was about to go to him  but he   stopped short with disdain  upon reflecting  that it was an act of   condescension which might be deemed
