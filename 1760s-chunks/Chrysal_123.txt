but his genius led him to other pursmts  and made fiim   depend upon the sharpness of his mind  rather than the strength of   his body  for his support and advancement in the world      The depravity of man makes many employments necessary in a   community for public safety and advantage  the execution of which   is attended with so many circumstances of horror in the punish    ment of unhappy delinquents  that no man  who is not destitute   of that sympathetic tenderness which is the highest honour of his   nature  can bear to undertake them  This throws them upon   persons  speculatively speaking  the most unfit for such offices   whose poverty obliges them to practise every iniquity of the pro    fession into which they were first initiated by vice  and whose hearts   are hardened by habit  against every sentiment of virtue and         128 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     honour  every finer feeling of nature  Thus the hangman  whose   crimes first reduced him to take up the horrid trade  continues it   from distress  and puts to death wretched offenders  for facts which   he is hourly guilty of himself  without compassion or remorse till   he is detected  and suffers the same punishment from another hand    But this is one of those defects of human policy which no human   heart can remedy      In an employment not very dissimilar in its nature  though   dignified by a less opprobrious name  has this person displayed his   abilities for many years  to the astonishment of all who have been   witnesses of his exploits  There is a mystery in such scenes  too   horrid for representation   I shall therefore pass them over  and   barely relate a few anecdotes of his private life  which will suffi    ciently enable you to form a judgment of his whole character      A man who  from one of the poorest employments by which a   wretched life can be honestly sustained  came unexpectedly to the   possession of a considerable fortune by the death of a relation    who would have suffered him to perish for want of a morsel of   bread  had some way conceived such a confidence in this person    that upon his own death  in a very little time after his elevation    he entrusted his orphan daughter to his care  together with what   he had been able to save for her during his short possession of hia   estate  the inheritance of it passing away  for want of his having   male issue  to another branch of the family      During the minority of his ward  he took care to educate her   according to the direction of her father  in a decent but frugal   manner  as the fortune she had a right to expect was not sufficient   to place her above the necessity of industry and economy  but   upon her coming of age  he was obliged to act another part  He   had spent the greatest part of her fortune in his pleasures  for     strange to think  even he had a passion for the pleasures of polite   life  and was admitted into the genteelest company  to enjoy them    without any inquiry into his character or station  while he was able   to bear the expense  Such a situation must have been distressing   to any other man  but the business of his profession soon suggested   a method of disengaging himself  which his extensive principles    made no objection to his putting in practice      On the day before she was to receive from him the fortune   which was the whole foundation of her future hopes in life  he    showed no signs of uneasiness  but confidently gave her notice that   he designed to pay her the moment she was entitled to receive it    and even appointed the other trustees of the will to meet at his    house and be witnesses to his punctual execution of his trust  Such   a conduct naturally gave satisfaction to every person concerned    and entirely removed some apprehension which they had entertained   before  But they soon found reason to change their sentiments   again  for  that very evening he took an occasion to go through a bye    street  just after it became dark  and when he thought himself in no   danger of being taken notice of  where he rolled himself in the kennel    battered his head against the stones  as if he had received several   severe strokes  and scattered some paper he had in his pocket for   that purpose about the streets   and then  in that abased appearance         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 12Â»     and  with all the symptoms of afiright and despair in his looks
