my father left thirty thousand pounds to Mr  Wilmot  which in equity ought to be regarded as mine  and which is all I desire  on the division  she  therefore by my will  has all she ever can expect  even from the strictest justice  and she can never  I think  hesitate between waiting till my death and at my mercy  and receiving at the present the utmost she could then hope for      I have heard from the Lady to whom I enclosed my letter  which she has returned  my niece having left France a year ago  to accompany a relation into Italy  What I  therefore  have to ask of you is  to endeavour to find her out  by your Italian friends  as I will by mine at the same time  that I          2 15       may write to her to return immediately to England  as I will not run the hazard of mentioning the subject in a letter  She is the daughter of the late colonel Hastings  once abroad in a public character  and is well known in Italy      Bellville is not at all in the secret of my scheme  nor did I ever tell him I would marry him  though I sometimes give him reason to hope        I am too good a politician in love matters ever to put a man out of doubt till half an hour before the ceremony  The moment a woman is weak enough to promise  she sets the heart of her lover at rest  the chace  and of consequence the pleasure  is at an end  and he has nothing to do but to seek a new object  and begin the pursuit over again            2 16          I tell you  but I tell it in confidence  that if I find Bell Hastings  if she comes into my scheme  and my mind does not change  I may  perhaps  do Bellville the honor  And yet  when I reflect on the matter  on the condition of the obligation   so long as ye both shall live     Jesu Maria  Only think of promising to be of the same mind as long as one lives  My dear Harry  people may talk as they will  but the thing is utterly impossible     Adieu    Mon cher Ami    A  Wilmot      To George Mordaunt  Esq      I Have already told you I came hither with a view of engaging Lord T     s interest in support of those views  on which all my hopes of happiness depend  The friendship he has ever professed for me has been warm as that of a father  I was continually with him at Rome  and he there          2 17       prest me to accept those services I then never expected to have occasion for  Till now content with my situation  love first raised in me the spirit of ambition  and determined me to accept those offers  In a former letter  I told you I was going to follow Lord T    into the garden  to communicate to him my purpose of pushing my fortune in the world  on which I had before given general hints  which he seemed to approve  as a kind of spirit becoming a young man  warm with hope  and not destitute of merit      On revolving my scheme as I approached him  it appeared so romantic  so void of all rational hope  that I had not resolution to mention it  and determined at least to suspend it till better digested  and more fitted to bear the cool eye of impartial reason  in these sentiments I should still have remained  had not a letter from Lady Anne Wilmot  by giving me jealousy  determined          2 18       me not to defer one moment a design on which all my happiness depended      I therefore  with some hesitation  this morning opened all my heart  and the real state of my circumstances  to Lord T      concealing only what related to Lady Julia  He heard me with great coolness  carelessly lolling on a settee  his eyes fixed on a new Chinese summer house  opposite the window near which he sat  and made me the following answer   Your views  Mr  Mandeville  seem rather romantic  for a man who has no party connexions  and so little parliamentary interest  However  you are of a good family  and there are things to be had in time if properly recommended  Have you no friend who would mention you to the minister   He then rang the bell hastily for his valet  and retired to dress leaving me motionless with astonishment and indignation            2 19          We me no more till
