more excuse me  than my brother  if I failed in either   I bowed  and blushed  Sir Charles look d at me with a benign aspect   My father  proceeded she  thought fit to be  or to seem to be  displeased with something that passed between him and Lord L  on the application made by my Lord to him for my sister   Sir Ch  He was not willing  perhaps that a treaty of marriage should be begun but at his own first motion  however unexceptionable the man  or the proposal   Miss Gr  Every one knows that my father had great abilities  and they were adorned with vivacity and spirit  that  where ever pointed  there was no resisting  He took his two daughters to task upon this occasion  and  being desirous to discourage in them  at that time  any thoughts of marriage  he exerted  besides his authority  on this occasion  which I can truly say  had due weight with us both  that vein of humour and raillery for which he was noted  insomuch that his poor girls were confounded  and unable to hold up their heads  My sister  in particular  was made to be ashamed of a passion  that surely no young woman  the object so worthy  ought to be ashamed of  My father also thought sit  perhaps for wise reason  to acquaint us  that he designed for us but small fortunes  And this depreciated me with myself  My sister had a stronger mind  and had better prospects  I could not but apprehend from what my sister suffer d  what must be my sufferings in turn  and I thought I could be induced to take any step  however rash  where virtue was not to be wounded  rather than undergo what she underwent from the raillery of a man so lively  and so humorous  and who stood in so venerable a degree of relation to me  While these impressions were strong in my mind  Captain Anderson  who was quarter d near us  had an opportunity to fall   268 into my company at an assembly  He is a sprightly man  and was well received by every body  and particularly a favourite of three young ladies  who could hardly be civil to each other  on his account  And this  I own  when he made assiduous court to me  in preference to them  and to every other woman  gave him some consequence with me  And then being the principal officer in that part of the country  he was caressed  as if he were a general  A daughter of Sir Thomas Grandison was deemed a prize worthy of his ambition  by every body  as well as by himself  While this poor daughter  dreading the difficulties that her sister had met with  and being led to think  by what her father declared to both sisters  that two or three thousand pounds would be the height of her fortune  had only to apprehend  that a captain either of horse or foot  who had been perhaps for years a frequenter of public places  both in town and country  in hopes of raising his fortune  would think himself but poorly paid for his pains  were she even to obtain her father s pardon  should she engage without waiting for his consent  as she was urged to do  by letter  which he found ways unsuspectedly to send her —I hope  Sir  I hope  my Lord  and you  my two sisters  that you will now  from what I have said  acquit me of insincerity  tho  you cannot of past indiscretion   Nevertheless  my pride at times was piqued  Sometimes I declared off  at other times was prevailed upon by arts which men are masters of  to go on again  till I found myself entangled  and at a loss to know how to go either backward or forward  The gentleman was indeed of a genteel family  But the object of my sister s regard had so much to be said for him  stood so well with my brother  and even with my father  was so much the man of quality  in every respect  that a rash step in me would be look d upon as the more disgraceful  on that account  And I could   269 not but apprehend  that if I married Captain Anderson  I must be pitied  rejected  scorned  for one while  if not for ever   And what title  often thought I  when I permitted myself seriously to think  have I to give my father a son  my brother  my sister  my Lord L   should he and my sister marry  a brother  whom they would not have chosen  nor will probably own —Have they not a right to reject him  as their relation  And shall Charlotte Grandison  the daughter of the most prudent of mothers  take a step that shall make her be looked upon as the disgrace of her family  Shall she be obliged to follow a soldier s fortune into different quarters  and perhaps to distant regions   Such as these were  at times  my reasonings  and perhaps they wouldhave had the less force with me  had
