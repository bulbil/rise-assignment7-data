its influence  it has often converted a Poet into a coral and bells  and a patriot Senator into a dumb waiter   Some days ago I went to visit the man in black  and entered his house with that chearfulness  which the certainty of a favourable reception always inspires  Upon opening the door of his apartment  I found him with the most rueful face imaginable in a morning gown and flannel nightcap  earnestly employed in learning to blow the German flute  Struck with the absurdity of a man in the decline of life  thus blowing away all his constitution and spirits  even without the consolation of being musical  I ventured to ask what could induce him to attempt learning so difficult an instrument so late in life  To this he made no reply  but groaning  and still holding the flute to his lip  continued to gaze at me for some moments very angrily  and then proceeded to practise his gammut as before  After having produced a variety of the most hideous tones in nature  at last turning to me  he demanded  whether I did not think he had made a surprizing progress in two days  You see  continues he  I have got the Ambusheer already  and as for fingering  my master tells me  I shall have that in a few lessons more  I was so much astonished with this instance of inverted ambition  that I know not what to reply    109 but soon discerned the cause of all his absurdities  my friend was under a metamorphosis by the power of spleen  and flute blowing was unluckily become his adventitious passion   In order therefore to banish his anxiety imperceptibly  by seeming to indulge it  I began to descant on those gloomy topics by which Philosophers often get rid of their own spleen  by communicating it  the wretchedness of a man in this life  the happiness of some wrought out of the miseries of others  the necessity that wretches should expire under punishment  that rogues might enjoy affluence in tranquility  I led him on from the inhumanity of the rich to the ingratitude of the beggar  from the insincerity of refinement to the fierceness of rusticity  and at last had the good fortune to restore him to his usual serenity of temper  by permitting him to expatiate upon all the modes of human misery    Some nights ago  says my friend  sitting alone by my fire  I happened to look into an account of the detection of a set of men called the thief takers  I read over the many hideous cruelties of those haters of mankind  of their pretended friendship to wretches they meant to betray  of their sending men out to rob and then hanging them  I could not avoid sometimes interrupting the narrative by crying out  Yet these are men  As I went on  I was informed that they had lived by this practice several years  and had been enriched by the price of blood  and yet  cried I  I have been sent into this world  and am desired to call these men my broth•rs  I read that the very man who led the condemned wretch to the gallows  was he who falsely swore his life away  and yet  continued I  that perjurer had   110 just such a nose  such lips  such hands and such eyes as Newton  I at last came to the account of the wretch that was searched after robbing one of the thief takers of half a crown  Those of the confederacy knew that he had got but that single half crown in the world  after a long search therefore  which they knew would be fruitless  and taking from him the half crown  which they knew was all he had  one of the gang compassionately cried out  Alas  poor a creature let him keep all the rest he has got  it will do him service in Newgate  where we are sending him  This was an instance of such complicated guilt and hypocrisy  that I threw down the book in an agony of rage  and began to think with malice of all the human kind  I sat silent for some minutes  and soon perceiving the ticking of my watch beginning to grow noisy and troublesome  I quickly placed it out of hearing  and strove to resume my serenity  But the watch man soon gave me a second alarm  I had scarcely recovered from this  when my peace was assaulted by the wind at my window  and when that ceased to blow  I listened for death watches in the wainscot  I now found my whole system discomposed  I strove to find a resource in philosophy and reason  but what could I oppose  or where direct my blow  when I could see no enemy to combat  I saw no misery approaching  nor knew any I had to fear  yet still I was miserable  Morning came  I sought for tranquility in dissipation  sauntered from one place of public resort to another  but found myself disagreeable to my acquaintance  and ridiculous to others  I tried at different times dancing  fencing  and riding  I solved geometrical problems  shaped tobacco stoppers  wrote verses and cut paper  At last I placed my affections   111 on music  and find  that earnest employment if cannot cure  at
