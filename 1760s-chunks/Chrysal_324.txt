seldom being acute or attentive enough   to distinguish between matters which to appearance are so intimately   connected as the mode of worship  and the object of it  but generally   involving either in the disregard affecting the other  In the present   instance  indeed  the disregard was designedly levelled at both   alike      To give you a proper notion of the scene in which my master was   going to act a capital part  it is necessary to trace thp whole from   the original  A person of a flighty imagination   and who possessed   a fortune that enabled him to pursue those flights  cloyed with   common pleasures  and ambitious of distinguishing himself among   his companions  had resolved to try if he could not strike out some    thing new  that should at the same time please his own taste  and   do honour to his genius  The mere gratifications of sense  in their   utmost extent  not answering his design  he had recourse to the   assistance of imagination to enhance them  The great butt  against   which men of pleasure play off all their wit  is religion   their reasons   for a practice so gross are obvious  As the voice of conscience   will sometimes intrude upon them so as to pall their highest plea    sure in the very moment of enjoyment  their first endeavour is to   silence it  which they find by experience cannot be done so effectu    ally by any other method as by this of taking off the respect paid to   religion  from which conscience borrows the terrors that make its   admonitions so unwelcome  Besides  they think it shows their   superiority over the rest of mankind to laugh at what they are   afraid of  as it is also convenient for their character of wit to exert   it on topics where it is safe from being rivalled by men of real   understanding      These weighty considerations determined him to season his   scheme as high as he could with impiety  in order to make it the   better relished  Accordingly  after due deliberation on a matter   of such moment  he at length hit upon a plan that pleased him      In the middle of a large lake upon his estate there was an island    the natural beauties of whose situation had been heightened by   every improvement of art  On this island he erected a building     exactly on the model of the monasteries which he had seen in other   countries  and  to make the resemblance complete  there was not a   vice that he had ever heard imputed to the inhabitants of them    for practising which he did not make provision in his  The cellars   were stored with the choicest wines  the larders with the delicacies   of every climate  and the cells were fitted up for all the purposes   of lasciviousness  for which proper objects were also provided    Thus far the ridicule  however criminal in itself  may seem to have   been designed only against those societies of human institution j   but it was beneath his genius and spirit to stop here  Nothing less   would satisfy him than to attack the very essentials of the religion   established by the laws of his country  and acknowledged by every   serious person in it to be divine  For this pious purpose  when   everything was prepared for their reception  his next care was to       Sir Francis Dashwood  see Introduction       Medmenham Abbey  see  Introduction           ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 385     find a fraternity proper for the place  But in this his rank and   course of life made him not long at a loss  He selected from among   his intimates a number equal to that of those who had been at the   first chosen to inculcate the religion which he designed to ridicule    whose names they assumed  as he  with equal modesty and piety   did that of the Divine Author of it   and  to supply any decrease   in this number by death  or desertion from the terrors of reflection    he instituted an inferior order of as many more  chosen also with   the greatest caution and regard to the latitude of their principles    their fortunes  and mirthful accomplishments  The probationary   office of these latter was to attend upon their superiors in the cele    bration of their mysteries  which were all performed in the chapel   of the monastery  where no other servants were ever permitted to   enter  on the most common occasion  as the very decorations of it   would  in a great measure  have betrayed their secrets  the ceiling   being covered with the emblems and devices too gross to require   explanation to the meanest capacity  and the walls painted
