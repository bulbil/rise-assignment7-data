 his works may please upon the perusal  but his pretensions to fame are intirely disregarded  he is treated like a fidler  whose music  though liked  is not much praised  because he lives by it  while a gentleman performer  though the most wretched scraper alive  throws the audience into raptures  The fidler indeed may in such a case console himself by thinking  that while the other goes off with all the praise  he runs away with all the money  but here the parrallel drops  for while the nobleman triumphs in unmerited applause  the author by profession  steals off with —Nothing   The poor  therefore  here  who draw their pens auxiliary to the laws of their country  must   249 think themselves very happy if they find  not fame but forgiveness  and yet they are hardly treated  for as every country grows more polite  the press becomes more useful  and writers become more necessary  as readers are supposed to increase  In a polished society  that man  though in rags  who has the power of enforcing virtue from the press  is of more real use than forty stupid brachmans or bonzes  or guebres  though they preached never so often  never so loud  or never so long  That man  though in rags  who is capable of deceiving even indolence into wisdom  and who professes amusement while he aims at reformation  is more useful in refined society than twenty cardinals with all their scarlet and tricked out in all the fopperies of scholastic finery   LETTER LVI  To the same   AS the man in black takes every opportunity of introducing me to such company as may serve to indulge my speculative temper  or gratify my curiosity  I was by his influence lately invited to a visitation dinner  To understand this term  you must know  that it was formerly the custom here for the principal priests to go about the country once a year  and examine upon the spot whether those of subordinate orders did their duty  or were qualified for the task  whether their temples were kept in proper repair  or the laity pleased with their administration     250Though a visitation of this nature was very useful  yet it was found to be extremely troublesome  and for many reasons utterly inconvenient  for as the principal priests were obliged to attend at court  in order to solicit preferment  it was impossible they could at the same time attend in the country  which was quite out of the road to promotion  if we add to this the gout  which has been time immemorial a clerical disorder here  together with the bad wine  and ill dressed provisions that must infallibly be served up by the way  it was not strange that the custom has been long discontinued  At present  therefore  every head of the church  instead of going about to visit his priests  is satisfied if his priests come in a body once a year to visit him  by this means the duty of half a year is dispatched in a day  When assembled  he asks each in his turn how they have behaved  and are liked  upon which  those who have neglected their duty  or are disagreeable to their congregation  no doubt accuse themselves  and tell him all their faults  for which  he reprimands them most severely   The thoughts of being introduced into a company of philosophers and learned men   for as such I conceived them  gave me no small pleasure  I expected our entertainment would resemble those sentimental banquets so finely described by Xenophon and Plato  I was hoping some Socrates would be brought in from the door  in order to harangue upon divine love  but as for eating and drinking I had prepared myself to be disappointed in that particular  I was apprized  that fasting and temperance were tenets strongly recommended to the professors of Christianity  and I had seen the   251 frugality and mortification of the priests of the east  so that I expected an entertainment where we should have much reasoning  and little meat   Upon being introduced  I confess I found no great signs of mortification in the faces or persons of the company  However  I imputed their florid looks to temperance  and their corpulency to a sedentary way of living  I saw several preparations indeed for dinner  but none for philosophy  The company seemed to gaze upon the table with silent expectation  but this I easily excused  Men of wisdom  thought I  are ever slow of speech  they deliver nothing unadvisedly  Silence  says Confucius  is a friend that will never betray  They are now probably inventing maxims  or hard sayings  for their mutual instruction  when some one shall think proper to begin   My curiosity was now wrought up to the highest pitch  I impatiently looked round to see if any were going to interrupt the mighty pause  when  at last  one of the company declared  that there was a sow in his neighbourhood that farrowed fifteen pigs at a litter  This I thought a very preposterous beginning  but just as another was going to second the remark  dinner was served  which interrupted the conversation for that time   The appearance of dinner  which consisted of a variety of dishes
