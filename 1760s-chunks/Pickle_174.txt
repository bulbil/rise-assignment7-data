at his house   Meanwhile they had provided a pleasure yacht  in which they proposed to  treat them with an excursion upon the Maese  This being almost the only  diversion that place affords  our young gentleman relished the proposal   and  notwithstanding the remonstrances of Mr  Jolter  who declined the  voyage on account of the roughness of the weather  they went on board  without hesitation  and found a collation prepared in the cabin  While  they tacked to and fro in the river  under the impulse of a mackerel  breeze  the physician expressed his satisfaction  and Pallet was  ravished with the entertainment  But the wind increasing  to the  unspeakable joy of the Dutchmen  who had now an opportunity of showing  their dexterity in the management of the vessel  the guests found it  inconvenient to stand upon deck  and impossible to sit below  on account  of the clouds of tobacco smoke which rolled from the pipes of their  entertainers  in such volumes as annoyed them even to the hazard of  suffocation  This fumigation  together with the extraordinary motion  of the ship  began to affect the head and stomach of the painter  who  begged earnestly to be set on shore  But the Dutch gentlemen  who had no  idea of his sufferings  insisted  with surprising obstinacy of regard     6 22 15  3 45 PM   upon his staying until he should see an instance of the skill of the  mariners  and  bringing him on deck  commanded the men to carry the  vessel s lee gunwale under water  This nicety of navigation they  instantly performed  to the admiration of Pickle  the discomposure of  the doctor  and terror of Pallet  who blessed himself from the courtesy  of a Dutchman  and prayed to Heaven for his deliverance   While the Hollanders enjoyed the reputation of this feat  and the  distress of the painter  at the same time  the yacht was overtaken by  a sudden squall  that overset her in a moment  and flung every man  overboard into the Maese  before they could have the least warning of  their fate  much less time to provide against the accident  Peregrine   who was an expert swimmer  reached the shore in safety  the physician   in the agonies of despair  laid fast hold on the trunk breeches of one  of the men  who dragged him to the other side  the entertainers  landed at the bomb keys  smoking their pipes all the way with great  deliberation  and the poor painter must have gone to the bottom  had not  he been encountered by the cable of a ship that lay at anchor near the  scene of their disaster  Though his senses had forsaken him  his hands  fastened by instinct on this providential occurrence  which he held with  such a convulsive grasp  that  when a boat was sent out to bring him  on shore  it was with the utmost difficulty that his fingers were  disengaged  He was carried into a house  deprived of the use of speech   and bereft of all sensation  and  being suspended by the heels  a vast  quantity of water ran out of his mouth  This evacuation being made  he  began to utter dreadful groans  which gradually increased to a continued  roar  and  after he had regained the use of his senses  he underwent  a delirium that lasted several hours  As for the treaters  they never  dreamed of expressing the least concern to Pickle or the physician  for what had happened  because it was an accident so common as to pass  without notice   Leaving the care of their vessel to the seamen  the company retired to  their respective lodgings  in order to shift their clothes  and in the  evening our travellers were conducted to the house of their new friend   who  with a view of making his invitation the more agreeable  had  assembled  to the number of twenty or thirty Englishmen  of all ranks  and degrees  from the merchant to the periwig maker s prentice   In the midst of this congregation stood a chafing dish with live coals   for the convenience of lighting their pipes  and every individual was  accommodated with a spitting box  There was not a mouth in the apartment  unfurnished with a tube  so that they resembled a congregation of  chimeras breathing fire and smoke  and our gentlemen were fain to  imitate their example in their own defence  It is not to be supposed  that the conversation was either very sprightly or polite  that the  whole entertainment was of the Dutch cast  frowzy and phlegmatic   and our adventurer  as he returned to his lodging  tortured with the  headache  and disgusted with every circumstance of his treatment  cursed  the hour in which the doctor had saddled them with such troublesome  companions   Next morning by eight o clock  these polite Hollanders returned the  visit  and  after breakfast  attended their English friends to the house  of a person that possessed a very curious cabinet of curiosities   to which they had secured our
