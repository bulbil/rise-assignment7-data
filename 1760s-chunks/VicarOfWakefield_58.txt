hours before night we reached the town  or rather village  for it consisted but of a few mean houses  having lost all its former opulence  and retaining no marks of its ancient superiority but the gaol     Upon entering  we put up at an inn  where we had such refreshments as could most readily be procured  and I supped with my family with my usual chearfulness  After seeing them properly accommodated for that night  I next attended the sheriff s officers to the prison  which had formerly been built for the purposes of war  and consisted of one large apartment  strongly grated  and paved with stone  common to both felons and debtors at certain hours in the four and twenty  Besides this  every prisoner had a separate cell  where he was locked in for the night     I expected upon my entrance to find nothing but lamentations  and various sounds  Page  93  of misery  but it was very different  The prisoners seemed all employed in one common design  that of forgetting thought in merriment or clamour  I was apprized of the usual perquisite required upon these occasions  and immediately complied with the demand  though the little money I had was very near being all exhausted  This was immediately sent away for liquor  and the whole prison soon was filled with riot  laughter  and prophaneness      How    cried I to myself    shall men so very wicked be chearful  and shall I be melancholy  I feel only the same confinement with them  and I think I have more reason to be happy    With such reflections I laboured to become chearful  but chearfulness was never yet produced by effort  which is itself painful  As I was sitting therefore in a corner of the gaol  in a pensive posture  one of  Page  94  my fellow prisoners came up  and sitting by me  entered into conversation  It was my constant rule in life never to avoid the conversation of any man who seemed to desire it  for if good  I might profit by his instruction  if bad  he might be assisted by mine  I found this to be a knowing man  of strong unlettered sense  but a thorough knowledge of the world  as it is called  or  more properly speaking  of human nature on the wrong side  He asked me if I had taken care to provide myfelf with a bed  which was a circumstance I had never once attended to      That s unfortunate    cried he    as you are allowed here nothing but straw  and your apartment is very large and cold  However you seem to be something of a gentleman  and as I have been one myself in my time  part of my bed cloaths are heartily at your service    Page  95  I thanked him  professing my surprize at finding such humanity in a gaol in misfortunes  adding  to let him see that I was a scholar      That the sage ancient seemed to understand the value of company in affliction  when he said  Ton kosmon aire  ei dos ton etairon  and in fact    continued I    what is the World if it affords only solitude     You talk of the world  Sir    returned my fellow prisoner    the world is in its dotage  and yet the cosmogony or creation of the world has puzzled the philosophers of every age  What a medly of opinions have they not broached upon the creation of the world  Sanconiathon  Manetho  Berosus  and Ocellus Lucanus have all attempted it in vain  The latter has these words  Anarchon ara kai atelutaion to pan  which implies  —   I ask pardon  Sir    cried I    for interrupting so much learning  but I think I have heard all this before   Page  96  Have I not had the pleasure of once seeing you at Welbridge fair  and is not your name Ephraim Jenkinson    At this demand he only sighed    I suppose you must recollect    resumed I    one Doctor Primrose  from whom you bought a horse    He now at once recollected me  for the gloominess of the place and the approaching night had prevented his distinguishing my features before —     Yes  Sir    returned Mr  Jenkinson    I remember you perfectly well I bought an horse  but forgot to pay for him  Your neighbour Flamborough is the only prosecutor I am any way afraid of at the next assizes  for he intends to swear positively against me as a coiner  I am heartily sorry  Sir  I ever deceived you  or indeed any man  for you see    continued he  shewing his shackles    what my tricks have brought me to    Page  97     Well  sir    replied I    your kindness in offering me assistance  when you could expect no return  shall be repaid with my endeavours to soften or totally suppress Mr
