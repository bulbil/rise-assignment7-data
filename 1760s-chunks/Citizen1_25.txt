critics contradict the fulminations of this tribunal  call them all spiders  and assure the public  that they ought to laugh without restraint  Another set are in the mean time quietly employed in writing notes to the book  intended to shew the particular passages to be laughed at  when these are out  others still there are who write notes upon notes  Thus a single new book employs not only the paper makers  the printers  the press men  the book binders  the hawkers  but twenty critics  and as many compilers  In short  the body of the learned may be compared to a Persian army  where there are many pioneers  several sutlers  numberless servants  women and children in abundance  and but few soldiers   Adieu   LETTER XXI  To the same   THE English are as fond of seeing plays acted as the Chinese  but there is a vast difference in the manner of conducting them  We play our pieces in the open air  the English theirs under cover  we act by day light  they by the blaze of torches  One of our plays continues eight or ten days successively  an English piece seldom takes up above four hours in the representation   My companion in black  with whom I am now beginning to contract an intimacy  introduced me a few nights ago to the play house  where we   77 placed ourselves conveniently at the foot of the stage  As the curtain was not drawn before my arrival  I had an opportunity of observing the behaviour of the spectators  and indulging those reflections which novelty generally inspires   The rich in general were placed in the lowest seats  and the poor rose above them in degrees proportioned to their poverty  The order of precedence seemed here inverted  those who were undermost all the day  now enjoyed a temporary eminence  and became masters of the ceremonies  It was they who called for the music  indulging every noisy freedom  and testifying all the insolence of beggary in exaltation   They who held the middle region seemed not so riotous as those above them  nor yet so tame as those below  to judge by their looks  many of them seem d strangers there as well as myself  They were chiefly employed during this period of expectation in eating oranges  reading the story of the play  or making assignations   Those who sat in the lowest rows  which are called the pit  seemed to consider themselves as judges of the merit of the poet and the performers  they were assembled partly to be amused  and partly to shew their taste  appearing to labour under that restraint which an affectation of superior discernment generally produces  My companion  however  informed me  that not one in an hundred of them knew even the first principles of criticism  that they assumed the right of being censors because there was none to contradict their pretensions  and that every man who now called   78 himself a connoisseur  became such to all intents and purposes   Those who sat in the boxes appeared in the most unhappy situation of all  The rest of the audience came merely for their own amusement  these rather to furnish out a part of the entertainment themselves  I could not avoid considering them as acting parts in dumb shew  not a curtesy or nod  that was not the result of art  not a look nor a smile that was not designed for murder  Gentlemen and ladies ogled each other through spectacles  for my companion observed  that blindness was of late become fashionable  all affected indifference and ease  while their hearts at the same time burned for conquest  Upon the whole  the lights  the music  the ladies in their gayest dresses  the men with chearfulness and expectation in their looks  all conspired to make a most agreeable picture  and to fill an heart that sympathises at human happiness with an expressible serenity   The expected time for the play to begin at last arrived  the curtain was drawn  and the actors came on  A woman  who personated a queen  came in curtesying to the audience  who clapped their hands upon her appearance  Clapping of hands is  it seems  the manner of applauding in England  the manner is absurd  but every country  you know  has its peculiar absurdities  I was equally surprised  however  at the submission of the actress  who should have considered herself as a queen  as at the little discernment of the audience who gave her such marks of applause before she attempted to deserve them  Preliminaries between her and the audience being thus   79 adjusted  the dialogue was supported between her and a most hopeful youth  who acted the part of her confidant  They both appeared in extreme distress  for it seems the queen had lost a child some fifteen years before  and still kept its dear resemblance next her heart  while her kind companion bore a part in her sorrows   Her lamentations grew loud  Comfort is offered  but she detests the very sound  She bids them preach comfort to the winds  Upon this her husband comes in  who  seeing the queen so much afflicted  can himself hardly refrain from tears or avoid partaking in the soft distress  After thus grieving through
