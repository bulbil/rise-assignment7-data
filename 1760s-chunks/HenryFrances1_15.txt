walk Abroad  so shall conclude  at present  with an extempore Tag    Vive la joye  et l amour   Et Diable emporte les Caseurs     Adieu   Henry   LETTER XXIV   MY dear Harry s Letter  at last  relieved me from ten thousand Anxieties  while you were on your Journey  which are better felt  than expressed  If you knew what Pain your Negligence gives me  I am sure you would be a little more punctual in your Correspondence  but I almost despair of ever making you sensible of the Delicacy of my Sentiments  and am sorry to find that you are still unknowing in my Heart  However  I accept your Apologies  for   with Ease  alas  we credit those we love   But I beg henceforward  that you would not be guilty of voluntary Faults and   34 Omissions  merely to shew  with what Address you can excuse them     I do not at all doubt your being perfectly happy  in the Company of agreeable Women  and more so than other Men can oast  in being approved by them  But    why am I told how Pyrrhus loves or hates   unless it be to mortify my Vanity  or hint that my Letters may be an impertinent Interruption to your Pleasures at Elton  Yet I am encouraged to write more particularly at this Time  because  perhaps  you may more readily come into my Platonick Scheme  and  that we may  without Loss of Time  enter upon that charming System  I beg  that  by Return of the Post  you will send me a full and true History of your giddy wandering Heart  from the Time it last trembled at a Rod  to its present Fluttering at Miss Rawley s Feet  whom I know to be one of your Company  and probably the fairest  but I shall pursue this Subject no farther  for I find myself beginning to grow grave  which is the next Step to growing dull     I am offended at your seeming to doubt my Knowledge in Sacred History  so shall refer you to the 7th Verse of the 8th Chapter of Genesis  where you will find  that the first living Creature  which fallied out of the Ark  was that very identical Raven  mentioned in my last Letter  I disclaim all Commerce with the Dove    35 because it returned with an Olive Branch  and I here declare War with your whole worthless Sex  be you alone excepted from my general Resentment  I wish you that soft Repose  which has been  this Week past  a Stranger to  Your own Fanny   LETTER XXV   Dear FANNY   TAKE Notice that this Letter is dated the 26th of April  1747  Old Stile  that you may see how punctual I am  in answering your s  For  by your saying  I was a Fortnight silent  I suppose Tom forgot my Letter in his Pocket  and I was really just sitting down to inquire what was become of you  when I received your s  I assure you I never suffer a Post to intervene between our Correspondence  and I will date my Letters henceforward to convince you of it   I am sorry you are ill—I am not much better myself  and am reduced to such a Degree of low Spirits  as I should be ashamed to own  but that I never disguise my Foibles to you  I hope it is owing merely to my Disorder  that your   36 Letter appears very unreasonable and unkind  but that and other Matters be referred to our Meeting  which shall be as soon as I am able to ride up to Town  and  tho  you stint me the Pleasure of your Company to Half an Hour  I shall find nothing new in that  for I never thought I had that Happiness longer in my Life   I thank you for the Trouble you have had about my Things  and have here sent you a Bill for the Costs  I have not seen them yet  but am resolved to like them  except the Green you have chosen be a Willow  which  from your Letter  I have Reason to apprehend   I may hear from you  once at least  before I shall be able to set out  and hope to have a better Account of your Health  to know when you have fixed for your Journey  and whither you are going   Adieu  I am Your s  in Sickness or in Health   LETTER XXVI   My dear HARRY   I AM extremely sorry to hear that you are ill  either in Body or Mind  and I sincerely wish  that my present Sympathy could alleviate your Pains  for I could with Pleasure say      37Ah  more than share them—give me all thy Griefs     I took the Air three or four Times in a vile Hack  and this has encumbered me with two new Disorders  a Cold and Tooth Ach  I have quite lost my Appetite  and oh  how long are the Nights  and how short my Slumbers  I am quite feeble  and my Spirits so low  that I
