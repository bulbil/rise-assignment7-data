so much dreaded by the whole fraternity  that they  shivered at the very mention of his name  and this character  which  some people would think an advantage to a man in debt  was the greatest  misfortune that could possibly happen to him  because no tradesman would  give him credit for the least trifle  on the supposition that he could  not indemnify himself in the common course of law    The parson did not approve of Mr  Hackabout s method of escaping   which he considered as a very unchristian attempt upon the lives of his  fellow subjects   It is enough   said he   that we elude the laws of our    6 22 15  3 45 PM   country  without murdering the officers of justice  For my own part  I  can lay my hand upon my heart  and safely say  that I forgive from  my soul the fellow by whom I was made a prisoner  although the  circumstances of his behaviour were treacherous  wicked  and profane   You must know  Mr  Pickle  I was one day called into my chapel  in order  to join a couple in the holy bands of matrimony  and  my affairs being  at that time so situated  as to lay me under apprehensions of an arrest   I cautiously surveyed the man through a lattice which was made for that  purpose  before I would venture to come within his reach  He was clothed  in a seaman s jacket and trousers  and had such an air of simplicity in  his countenance  as divested me of all suspicion  I therefore  without  further scruple  trusted myself in his presence  began to exercise  the duty of my function  and had actually performed one half of the  ceremony  when the supposed woman  pulling out a paper from her bosom   exclaimed  with a masculine voice   Sir  you are my prisoner  I have got  a writ against you for five hundred pounds   I was thunderstruck at this  declaration  not so much on account of my own misfortune  which  thank  Heaven  I can bear with patience and resignation  as at the impiety of  the wretch  first  in disguising such a worldly aim under the cloak of  religion  and  secondly  in prostituting the service  when there was no  occasion for so doing  his design having previously taken effect  Yet I  forgive him  poor soul  because he knew not what he did  and I hope you   Sir Simple  will exert the same Christian virtue towards the man by whom  you were likewise overreached     Oh  d   the rascal   cried the knight   were I his judge  he should  be condemned to flames everlasting  A villain  to disgrace me in such  a manner  before almost all the fashionable company in town   Our hero  expressing a curiosity to know the particulars of this adventure  the  knight gratified his desire  by telling him  that one evening  while  he was engaged in a party of cards  at a drum in the house of a certain  lady of quality  he was given to understand by one of the servants  that  a stranger  very richly dressed  was just arrived in a chair  preceded  by five footmen with flambeaux  and that he refused to come upstairs   until he should be introduced by Sir Simple   Upon this notice    continued the knight   I judged it was some of my quality friends  and   having obtained her ladyship s permission to bring him up  went down to  the hall  and perceived a person  whom  to the best of my recollection   I had never seen before  However  his appearance was so magnificent   that I could not harbour the least suspicion of his true quality  and   seeing me advance  he saluted me with a very genteel bow  observing   that though he had not the honour of my acquaintance  he could not  dispense with waiting upon me  even on that occasion  in consequence of  a letter which he had received from a particular friend  So saying  he  put a paper into my hand  intimating that he had got a writ against  me for ten thousand pounds  and that it would be my interest to submit  without resistance  for he was provided with a guard of twenty men   who surrounded the door in different disguises  determined to secure me  against all opposition  Enraged at the scoundrel s finesse  and trusting  to the assistance of the real footmen assembled in the hall   So you are  a rascally bailiff   said I   who have assumed the garb of a gentleman   in order to disturb her ladyship s company  Take this fellow  my lads   and roll him in the kennel  Here are ten guineas for your trouble    These words were no sooner pronounced  than I was seized  lifted up   placed in a chair  and carried off in the twinkling
