stances   he keeps his coach  has taken a fine new house  and lives   at a high rate  I sent in my name  with notice that I came to him   on business of consequence  I was thereupon shown to a back   parlour  where he sat in company with Mrs  Clement and a lusty   ill looking young gentleman   but your stepmother has a comely   and good humoured countenance   she also appears to be far ad    vanced in her pregnancy  Mrs  Graves  said your father  take a   seat  What are your commands with me  madam   I came  sir    to let you know that your son  Mr  Hammel Clement  the best of   human beings  has been at the point of death  Have you nothing   to say to me  madam  but what concerns my son Hammel   I have   not  I confess  sir but that is more than enough  it is very   interesting and aifecting  and concerns you most nearly  Here   Mr  Clement  for I will never more call him by the sacred name   of father   here  I say  he started up  and catching at a book  he   pressed it to his lips and cried 1 swear by the virtue of this   and all other holy books  that I will never listen to any person   who would speak a single word in behalf of Hammel Clement   and   so  mistress  give me leave to show you the way out again  So   saying  he caught my hand and drew me to the door  while I   turned and cried to your stepmother O madam  what sort of   a heart is yours  that refuses its intercession on this occasion     But she gave me an eye and sneer  of such a mischievous meaning    as expressed the whole fiend under the guise of an angel  When   Mr  Clement had taken me to the outward door  I just turned and   said I am sorry  sir  that a man of your grave and sensible   appearance should suffer yourself to be so duped by people whose   interest it is to deceive you  but  swelling into choler  he gave me   a violent push from him  and clapped to the door in my face  So   that  in short  my dear child  I fear I have done you harm  where   I meant you true service      It matters not  my mother  said I  endeavouring to suppress a   tear of tender resentment   I will soon  I trust  procure some kind   of independence on that barbarian and his fortune   and while I have   you and your Arabella  I shall want neither father nor friend      Being now very nearly re established in my health  I set out   again in search after some employment that might suit me  As   I was strolling on Tower Hill  1 observed a shop on my left hand     it was that of Mr  Wellcot  a bookseller and printer  I stepped in    and after some introductory discourse I asked him if he had occa    sion  in the way of his business  for a friend of mine a gentle    man in distress  but of parts and learning  Alas  sir   cried   Wellcot  such creatures as you mention are a drug upon earth          80 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      there is a glut of them in all markets  I would give any one a   broad piece per man who should deliver me from three or four of   them who lie heavy on my hands  Not  sir  that they are greedy   or idle in the least   I can get one of these gentlemen  as you are   pleased to call them  on whose education more money has been   expended than  at the common and legal interest  would maintain   a decent family to the end of the world I can get one of them    I say  to labour like a hackney horse from morning to night  at   less wages than I could hire a rascally porter or shoe boy for three   hours  I employ them occasionally in correcting the press  or fold    ing or stitching the sheets  or running of errands  But then  sir    they have all of them aspects of such a bilious despondence  that   a man may with less melancholy behold a death s head   and   really  sir  I could not stand it  if custom  as I may say  did not   harden me by the perpetual vision of these spectres      While Wellcot was speaking  I made a secret vow against having   any kind
