had shone as bright as the shield of Achilles  or as the emblem of good old English fare  which hangs by a red ribbon round the neck of that thrice honoured sage s head  in velvet bonnet cased  who presides by rotation at the genial board  distinguished by the title of the Beef steak Club where the delicate rumps irresistibly attract the stranger s eye  and  while they seem to cry   Come cut me—come cut me   constrain  by wondrous sympathy  each mouth to overflow  Where the obliging and humorous Jemmy B——t  the gentle Billy H——d  replete with human kindness  and the generous Johnny B——d  respected and beloved by all the world  attend as the priests and ministers of mirth  good cheer  and jollity  and assist with culinary art the raw  unpractised  awkward guest   But to return from this digressive simile  The ostler no sooner stept between those menacing antagonists  than Tom Clarke very quietly resumed his clothes  and Mr  Ferret resigned the gridiron without further question  The doctor did not find it quite so easy to release the throat of Captain Crowe from the masculine grasp of the virago Dolly  whose fingers could not be disengaged until the honest seaman was almost at the last gasp  After some pause  during which he panted for breath  and untied his neckcloth   D—n thee  for a brimstone galley   cried he   I was never so grappled withal since I knew a card from a compass — Adzooks  the jade has so tautened my rigging  d ye see  that I—Snatch my bowlines  if I come athwart thy hawser  I ll turn thy keel upwards—or mayhap set thee a driving under thy bare poles—I will—I will  you hell fire  saucy—I will    Dolly made no reply  but seeing Mr  Clarke sit down again with great composure  took her station likewise at the opposite side of the apartment  Then Mr  Fillet requested the lawyer to proceed with his story  which  after three hems  he accordingly prosecuted in these words    I told you  gemmen  that Mr  Greaves was mounted on Scipio  when he saw Miss Darnel and her mother in danger of being hurried over a precipice  Without reflecting a moment  he gave Scipio the spur  and at one spring he cleared five and twenty feet  over hedge and ditch and every obstruction  Then he rode full speed  in order to turn the coach horses  and  finding them quite wild and furious  endeavoured to drive against the counter of the hither horse  which he missed  and staked poor Scipio on the pole of the coach  The shock was so great  that the coach horses made a full stop within ten yards of the quarry  and Mr  Greaves was thrown forwards towards the coach box  which mounting with admirable dexterity  he seized the reins before the horses could recover of their fright  At that instant the coachman came running up  and loosed them from the traces with the utmost despatch  Mr  Greaves had now time to give his attention to the ladies  who were well nigh distracted with fear  He no sooner opened the chariot door than Aurelia  with a wildness of look  sprung into his arms  and  clasping him round the neck  fainted away  I leave you to guess  gemmen  what were his feelings at this instant  The mother was not so discomposed  but that she could contribute to the recovery of her daughter  whom the young squire still supported in his embrace  At length she retrieved the use of her senses  and  perceiving the situation in which she was  the blood revisited her face with a redoubled glow  while she desired him to set her down upon the turf    Mrs  Darnel  far from being shy or reserved in her compliments of acknowledgments  kissed Mr  Launcelot without ceremony  the tears of gratitude running down her cheeks  she called him her dear son  her generous deliverer  who  at the hazard of his own life  had saved her and her child from the most dismal fate that could be imagined    Mr  Greaves was so much transported on this occasion  that he could not help disclosing a passion  which he had hitherto industriously concealed   What I have done   said he   was but a common office of humanity  which I would have performed for any of my fellow creatures  but for the preservation of Miss Aurelia Darnel  I would at any time sacrifice my life with pleasure   The young lady did not hear this declaration unmoved  Her face was again flushed  and her eyes sparkled with pleasure  Nor was the youth s confession disagreeable to the good lady  her mother  who  at one glance  perceived all the advantages of such an union between the two families    Mr  Greaves proposed to send the coachman to his father s stable for a pair of sober horses  that could be depended upon  to draw the ladies home to their own habitation  but they declined the offer  and chose to walk  as the distance was not great  He then insisted upon his being their conductor  and  each taking him under the arm
