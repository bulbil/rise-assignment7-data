have been more cautious in my approach  especially as I found   you deep in contemplation  which  perhaps  I have been my own enemy by   interrupting        Till he spoke in this manner  she was not quite assured how far he had   been witness of her behaviour  but what he now said confirming her of   what she had but feared before  threw her into a second confusion little   inferior to the former  He saw it  but saw it without that pity he would   have felt had it proceeded from any other motive  and  eager to bring   her to a more full eclaircissement   If you really think  Madam   said   he   that you have any obligations to me  you may requite them all by   answering sincerely to one question  Tell me  I beseech you   continued   he  taking up the picture  which she had neither thought nor opportunity   to remove from the place where it had fallen   resolve me how this   little picture came into your possession   What was now the condition of   Mrs  Munden  She could neither find any pretence to evade the truth    nor fit words to confess it  till Mr  Trueworth repeating his request    and vowing he would never leave her till she granted it   What need have   I to answer   said she  blushing   You know it what manner it was taken   from the painter s  and the sight of it in my hand is sufficient to   inform you of the whole         Charming declaration   transporting  ravishing  to thought   cried he    kissing her hand   O had I known it sooner  engaged as I then was to one   who well deserved my love  could I have guessed Miss Betsy Thoughtless   was the contriver of that tender fraud  I know not what revolution might   have happened in my heart  the empire you had there was never totally   extirpated  and kindness might have regained what cruelty had   lost     Do not deceive yourself  Sir   said she  interrupting him with   all the courage she could assume   nor mistake that for love which was   only the effect of mere gratitude   These words were accompanied with a   look which once would have struck him with the most submissive awe  but   he was now too well acquainted with the sentiments she had for him to be   deterred by any other outward shew of coldness   Call it by what name   you please   cried he   so you permit me the continuance of it  and   vouchsafe me the same favours you bestow on my insensible resemblance     In speaking this  he threw his arms about her waist  not regarding the   efforts she made to hinder him  and clasped her to his breast with a   vehemence which in all his days of courtship to her he never durst   attempt   Forbear  Sir   said she   you know I am not at liberty to be   entertained with discourses  or with actions  of this nature  Loose me   this moment  or be assured  all the kind thoughts I had of you  and on   which you have too much presumed  will be converted into the extremest   hatred and detestation   The voice in which she uttered this menace   convincing him how much she was in earnest  he let go his hold  removed   some paces from her  and beheld her for some moments with a silent   admiration   I have obeyed you  Madam   cried he  with a deep sigh   you   are all angel  be all angel still  Far be it from me to tempt you from   the glorious height you stand in  yet how unhappy has this interview   made me  I love you without daring even to wish for a return  nay  so   fully has your virtue conquered  that I must love you more for the   repulse you have given my too audacious hopes  You may at least pity the   fate to which I am condemned         It would be in vain for me   replied she  in a voice somewhat broken by   the inward conflict she sustained   to endeavour to conceal what my   inadvertencies have so fully betrayed to you  and you may assure   yourself  that I shall think on you with all the tenderness that honour    and the duties of my station  will admit  But remember  Sir  I am a   wife  and  being such  ought never to see you more  in regard    therefore  to my reputation and peace of mind  I must intreat you will   henceforth avoid my presence with the same care I will do
