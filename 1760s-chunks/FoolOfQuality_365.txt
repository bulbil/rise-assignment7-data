some porters  and throwing them a parcel of   silver  ordered them to bring all the coaches they could muster    And go you  says he to his page  go to the shipping  inquire after   the friends that I told you of  and then follow me to the Whitecross   tavern in Cheapside      The coaches came  and Harry assisted his porters in carrying    helping  and gently stowing the maimed and the wounded into   some of them  He then handed in the lady   and next  coming   to a blackamoor boy  who had a coronet of diamonds inserted in   his cap  he offered to lift him in  But the youth  bending one   knee to the dust  and seizing on Harry s hand  eagerly and re    peatedly kissed it  crying out ill French Heavenly  heavenly   creature   and then  breaking into tears  he sprung into the coach    and sat down by the lady      Our hero then bestowed the four female attendants  with such   luggage as was brought on shore  into the remaining coaches  Then   grasping his quarter staff  and ordering the porters to attend  he   guarded and escorted all safe to the Whitecross      The first thing he then did was to order private apartments for   the lady and her attendants  He next despatched the waiters for   all the surgeons in the neighbourhood  He then locked the room   where he saw the luggage safe lodged  ordered a sumptuous   dinner to be prepared as soon as possible   and  lastly  discharged   the coaches and porter  who poured their parting blessings upon         406 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      his head   and all this he did with wonderful despatch  for Harry   was now in the wide element of his beneficence  as a whale in   the ocean      Three surgeons then came  and our hero  putting five guineas a   piece into their hands  desired them to examine and dress their   patients  and stayed till he heard the delightful tidings that   none of them were incurable  He then sent up to the lady to   desire permission to attend her  She rose and met him as he   entered  Child of heaven   said she  from which of the orders of   angels have you descended  I have heard as well as seen what   you have wonderfully done for us  Madam  said Harry  endeavour    ing to turn the discourse  I would not advise you to remove your   people for some time   I have ordered beds and apartments for   them in this house  where those that are tolerably well may assist   the doctors to attend their sick fellows till all shall be restored    In the mean time  I have sent to m  Other s for his coach and   chariot  to convey you and this young gentleman and your woman   to our house  where you can want for no servants  since my father   and I  and all  will be truly and tenderly your servants  We are   your property  sir  said tha lady  dispose of us as you please      In a little time after dinner was served up  and Harry  happening   to turn his head  perceived the black youth by stealth kissing   the hat and pressing the gloves to his bosom that he had laid on   the table      Whatever the darkness or deformity of any aspect or person   may happen to be  if the sentimental beauty of soul shall burst   through the cloud upon us  the dark becomes light  the deformed   quite comely  and we begin to affect what was lately our aversion    Thus it was that Harry found himself suddenly and inevitably   attached by the two recent proofs that this outlandish youth had   given of his affection      Being all seated  Harry looked earnestly at the young Moor  and    turning to the lady  said I now perceive  madam  how ridiculous   all sorts of prejudices are  and find that time and observation may   change our opinions to the reverse of what they were  I once had   an aversion to all sorts of blacks   but I avow that there is some    thing so amiable in the face of this youth  and his eyes cast such   a lustre over the darkness of his countenance  as is enough  as   Shakespeare has it  to make us in love with night  and pay no   more worship to the gaudy sun      The Moor hereat smiled celestial sweetness  and joy beamed from   his eyes  and throughout his dimpling aspect      But who can you be  my sweet fellow
