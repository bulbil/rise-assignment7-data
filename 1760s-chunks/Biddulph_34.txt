to nothing  On the contrary  had my father’s just intentions taken place  in leaving me five thousand pounds  she would have come in for the other five  but the whole ten thousand now went to my sister   She was not long however at a loss to know how this came to pass  Mr Vere determined to assert his own  and his son’s right  and being exceedingly provoked at my mother’s behaviour  wrote to her immediately on his return home  and having informed her of the settlement made on me  on account of the fortune already paid  and what was farther agreed on to be paid by my father  told her  he expected that this promise should be punctually fulfilled  He said  he knew she had it in her power to do this  and since it was by her contrivance I had been robbed of my just right  if honour  and the duty of a parent  would not induce her to make me proper amends  she must excuse him  if he made use of such means as the laws allowed him  in order to compel her   Such a letter  to a woman of my mother’s temper  met with such a reception as might be expected  She tore it before his messenger’s face  and desired him to tell his master  that as what he had already obtained was by fraud  so he was at liberty to make use of force to recover the remainder  but with her consent  he never should have a single shilling     This exasperating reply  made my father in law directly commence a suit against her  in which the other legatees were made parties  The distress I felt on this occasion is scarce to be imagined  the breach was now so Widened between my mother and my husband’s family  that there remained not the least hope of its ever being closed  Mr Vere unwillingly joined with his father in pursuit of these measures  He would for my sake much rather have yielded up his expectations  than supported them at the expence of my quiet  but his father’s will  and justice to the rest of his family  compelled him to proceed  and deprived me of any pretence for interposing   The law suit was carrying on with great acrimony on both sides  when an event happened  that made me then  and has indeed ever since  look with indifference on every thing in this life  it was the death of my husband  He was snatched from me by a violent fever  before he reached his twentieth year   I will not pretend to describe my sufferings to you on this sad occasion  they were aggravated by my being near the time of lying in   Whatever affliction Mr Vere felt for the death of his only son  it did not make him forgetful of what he owed his daughters  and he was resolved to carry on the law suit with the utmost vigour   You may suppose the house wherein I had lost a beloved husband appeared a dismal place to me  especially in my present situation  I thought too  my father’s looks began to grow colder to me than they used to be  and I begged I might have his permission to remove for a while  He did not oppose it  and I went  at the pressing intreaties of your favourite  the good old dean  to his house  where he and his lady behaved to me with more than parental tenderness  My health was in so declining a way  that this worthy man  as I have since learned  made several applications to my mother to see me  but without success  At length the hour of my delivery arrived  and I was brought to bed of a dead female child  The estate  in case of Mr Vere’s dying without issue  devolved on his sisters  and I was in hopes that this circumstance  so favourable to the young ladies  would have induced their father to have been less rigorous in persisting in his claim  But in this I was deceived  he loved money  and was besides full of resentment against my mother  I thought however of an expedient  which I flattered myself might work upon him  and by good fortune it succeeded   Mr Vere  though I had left his house  visited me constantly  and kept up a shew of tenderness  which I am sure he had not in his    heart  I told him one day  whilst I was still confined to my bed  that as I had now lost both my husband and my child  a very moderate income would be sufficient for me  and that as I valued my mother’s peace of mind  beyond any selfish consideration  I was very willing to give up half my jointure  provided he would drop his suit  Mr Vere seemed surprized at the proposal  he said  he wondered I could be so blind to my own interest  and that all he was doing was purely for my sake  I thanked him for his pretended friendship  but assured him  he could serve me no way so effectually  as by coming into the measure I proposed  Mr Vere said  I talked like a child  but he would consider of it  The following day he
