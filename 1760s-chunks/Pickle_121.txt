though he would have much rather fasted three days than run the risk of  discomposing his dress by such an attitude   stretched himself upon the  opposite place  reclining upon his elbow in a most painful and awkward  situation  with his head raised above the end of the couch  that the  economy of his hair might not suffer by the projection of his body  The  Italian  being a thin limber creature  planted himself next to Pickle   without sustaining any misfortune but that of his stocking being torn  by a ragged nail of the seat  as he raised his legs on a level with the  rest of his limbs  But the baron  who was neither so wieldy nor supple  in his joints as his companions  flounced himself down with such  precipitation  that his feet  suddenly tilting up  came in furious  contact with the head of the marquis  and demolished every curl in a  twinkling  while his own skull  at the same instant  descended upon the  side of his couch  with such violence  that his periwig was struck off   and the whole room filled with pulvilio   The drollery of distress that attended this disaster entirely vanquished  the affected gravity of our young gentleman  who was obliged to  suppress his laughter by cramming his handkerchief in his mouth  for the  bare headed German asked pardon with such ridiculous confusion  and  the marquis admitted his apology with such rueful complaisance  as were  sufficient to awake the mirth of a quietist   This misfortune being repaired as well as the circumstances of  the occasion would permit  and every one settled according to the  arrangement already described  the doctor graciously undertook to give  some account of the dishes as they occurred  that the company might be  directed in their choice  and with an air of infinite satisfaction thus  began   This here  gentlemen  is a boiled goose  served up in a sauce  composed of pepper  lovage  coriander  mint  rue  anchovies  I wish  for your sakes  gentlemen  it was one of the geese of Ferrara  so much  celebrated among the ancients for the magnitude of their livers  one  of which is said to have weighed upwards of two pounds  with this food   exquisite as it was  did the tyrant Heliogabalus regale his hounds  But  I beg pardon  I had almost forgot the soup  which I hear is so necessary  an article at all tables in France  At each end there are dishes of the  salacacabia of the Romans  one is made of parsley  pennyroyal  cheese   pine tops  honey  brine  eggs  cucumbers  onions  and hen livers  the  other is much the same as the soup maigre of this country  Then there  is a loin of veal boiled with fennel and caraway seed  on a pottage  composed of pickle  oil  honey  and flour  and a curious hachis of the  lights  liver  and blood of a hare  together with a dish of roasted    6 22 15  3 45 PM   pigeons  Monsieur le baron  shall I help you to a plate of this soup    The German  who did not at all disapprove of the ingredients  assented  to the proposal  and seemed to relish the composition  while the marquis  being asked by the painter which of the silly kickabys he chose  was   in consequence of his desire  accommodated with a portion of the  soup maigre  and the count  in lieu of spoon meat  of which he said he  was no great admirer  supplied himself with a pigeon  therein conforming  to the choice of our young gentleman  whose example he determined to  follow through the whole course of the entertainment   The Frenchman  having swallowed the first spoonful  made a full pause   his throat swelled as if an egg had stuck in his gullet  his eyes  rolled  and his mouth underwent a series of involuntary contractions and  dilatations  Pallet  who looked steadfastly at this connoisseur  with a  view of consulting his taste  before he himself would venture upon the  soup  began to be disturbed at these motions  and observed  with some  concern  that the poor gentleman seemed to be going into a fit  when  Peregrine assured him  that these were symptoms of ecstasy  and  for  further confirmation  asked the marquis how he found the soup  It was  with infinite difficulty that his complaisance could so far master  his disgust as to enable him to answer   Altogether excellent  upon my  honour   and the painter being certified of his approbation  lifted the  spoon to his mouth without scruple  but far from justifying the eulogium  of his taster  when this precious composition diffused itself upon his  palate  he seemed to be deprived of all sense and motion  and sat like  the leaden statue of some river god  with the liquor flowing out at both  sides of his mouth   The doctor  alarmed at this indecent phenomenon  earnestly inquired into  the cause of it
