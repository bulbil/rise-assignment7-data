admittance to his worship s presence  At length they received notice to appear before him  and the elderly lady  being an housekeeper  was first examined   When the merits of her cause were heard  the justice commanded her mittimus to be drawn  and her person conveyed to the secure mansion of Tothil  Her tears and supplications on this occasion were of no force at all  and she was given to understand by his worship  that he could see through those crocodile artifices  and was not to be imposed upon by fair speeches  ordering his myrmidons to see her lodged in the apartment to which he had consigned her  While the clerk was preparing her mittimus  the gentleman came in who had been in her company the preceeding night  in order to make deposition of his having had his pocket picked of his watch  This gentleman declared upon oath  that there was nobody in the room but the bawd and his enamorata  upon which the arch   66 hypocrite fell on her knees  and with artful tears protested her innocence  but the justice giving her a sign  she returned the watch  with which the owner retired contentedly  and the poor girl was committed   Our heroine beheld with indignation this distribution of justice  which permitted the guilty to escape with impunity  while the innocent suffered the most rigorous award  apprehending that she herself might probably accompany the young lady to the hempen block  But these apprehensions soon subsided  when Mrs  Lamb  an old gentlewoman perfectly well known to his worship  appeared to vouch for her character  and she being immediately set at liberty  returned home with her benevolent landlady   Being arrived at her lodgings  she could not forbear making some remarks on the late incident that had befallen her  as well as exclaiming against a monstrous perversion of law  which is daily practised in our streets  seizing on persons who quietly pass without offering the least outrage   67 or molestation to any person  This she thought could not be justified on principles of English liberty  which certainly permits the subject to pass unmolested at all hours  provided they infringe not the laws of peace  by disturbing the inhabitants  or harassing the passengers  She also took notice  that  unless our zealous reformers found out some more effectual method of stopping the progress of vice  than that of seizing on poor unhappy women promiscuously  and consigning them to the vilest receptacles  where they were rendered more impudent  and which only served to harden them in sin  avaricious villains would prostitute the sacred name of law  to countenance the gratification of their sordid disposition   The reader will please to observe  that in all her troubles  her dear M—y  by whose consent she had admitted others to a participation of the same favours with which she indulged him  never was in a condition to afford her any relief in all her distresses  or to contribute in the least towards extricating her out of any difficulty she fell into  She   68 had therefore no resource lest  but to form the best plan she could in her former unhappy station in life   Having now  by a course of experience  acquired a competent knowledge of the world of intrigue  she was now fully accomplished for sustaining the character of a professed courtezan  She was indeed at present under the controul of Mrs  Lamb  to whom she was indebted for the immediate means of her existence  but she soon managed affairs so well  as to free  herself from the trammels of that imposing mercenary wretch   A variety of incidents had taught her the necessity of a gaudy outside shew  and a double tongue  in order to accomplish the different schemes of a woman of pleasure  so that she became versed in all the chicanery that constitutes experienced guilt  Her prevailing love of novelty rendered her a more agreeable companion to each successive cully  and prompted her to a behaviour that frequently extorted gratuities from that part of female admirers    69 who prefer the giving to the receiving of pleasure in amorous encounters   Being enrolled in the list of the infamous pimp master general  her assignations became very frequent  and as she now acted with an immediate view to pecuniary advantage  her finances increased  and enabled her in a short time to discharge Mrs  Lamb s debt  and once more embark in the world of gallantry on her own bottom   Accordingly being well furnished with the necessary apparatus of her profession  she frequented the park  and the play  and raised herself to a very high degree of eminence in the rank of female adventurers   She had not long frequented the fashionable assemblies of the gay and polite  before several gentlemen declared themselves smitten with her charms  though none paid their addresses to her on the score of marriage  or made her any other overtures than some customary remarks on her beauty     70I must here beg the readers pardon for a short digression  in order to give them some idea of what is meant by female admirers  They may be considered  as composed of three classes  viz  The honourable  the dishonourable  and the negative or dangling  implying neither the one nor the other  The first set of admirers generally require not beauty alone in a lady
