with our friend De Wit  and   through him you shall learn the first favourable turn that happens   in our affairs  I leave you my ring  in token of your being   the wedded of our heart  and Louisa leaves you her watch  to   remind you of time past  and to look upon when at leisure  and   think of       Your ELOISA DE         Your LOUISA DE        Yes  I cried  ye precious relics  ye delicious memorandums  to   my lips  to my heart   Be ye the companions of my solitude  the   consolers of my affliction   Sooner shall this arm be torn off  and   time itself pass away  than one or the other shall be divided from   my custody      Ah  how useless are admonitions to the impatience of a lover     Fervent love can know no fears  I was no sooner able to sit   my horse than I set off directly for Paris  with this precaution   only  that my people were to call me by my mother s maiden name   of Goodall      As we knew not the names or titles of those after whom we   were in search  our eyes became our only inquisitors   and we daily   ranged the town  peering into every carriage of distinction for a   sight of the mother or daughter  and even prying among the   lackeys and liveries for the face of our friend Gerard      On a day  as my valiant Tirlah and I rode abroad  reconnoitring         378 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      the suburbs  we heard a noise and shout of distress that issued   from a distant farm house   and as we hastened up the tumult   grew louder  and the cry of Help   and Murder   was several   times repeated      We instantly knocked at the door  but were refused admittance    when Tirlah alighted  ran against it  and breaking through bars   and all with his foot  threw the door off its hinges      On entering  we saw a man with four others about him  who were   going to slit his nose  and to use him very barbarously  Stay your   hands  I cried   I will shoot the first man through the head who   shall dare to proceed in this business      Why  sir  said a young fellow  this man wanted to be gracious   with my pretty young wife   I caught him in the very attempt     and so I think it but fair and honest to spoil his beauty for such   sport for time to come  Ay  but  said I  you might murder him    and I cannot suffer that  Come  my friend  no harm appears to be   done as yet   and  if he pays a handsome penance for the wicked    ness of his intention  I would advise you to pass matters over for   the present  Say  how much do you demand  Five hundred   louis d ors  said the fellow  if he pays that he shall be quit for   this turn      Five hundred louis d ors   I exclaimed   why  all the clothes on   his back are not worth the hundredth part of the sum  True    master  said the peasant  winking  but his pockets may happen to   be richer than his clothes  Well  said I  if he secures you in half   the sum I think you may be satisfied  Why  master  since you   have said it  I will not go back  Whereupon the astonished   prisoner was permitted to rise      What do you say  you very bad man  Are you willing to pay   this fellow the sum I agreed for  in compensation of the injury   you attempted to do him   I am  sir  said he   with many thanks   for your mediation  Then  hastily putting his hand to his pocket    he took out a note on the Customs  which  with some small   matter of cash  made up the money  and we departed the house   together      As I was just going to mount  he came up and accosted me with   elegance and dignity  Sir  said he  you have made me your debtor   beyond expression  beyond the power of princes to pay  Be pleased    however  to accept the little I have about me  here are five   thousand louis in this little note book  Not a penny  sir  indeed     I am by no means in want  You must not
