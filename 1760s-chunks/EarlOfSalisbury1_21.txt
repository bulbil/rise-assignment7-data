 I gratified the curious peasant  whose hospitable door was opened for  our reception  with the recital of hardy deeds atchieved by his noble  countrymen when the christian powers united against the infidel  and  oftentimes have I repeated my tale  to gain his confidence  and to lead  him to some discoveries that might direct me to my friend  But never  could we receive the least information of Les Roches  or of his  fortunes  Oblivion seemed to have involved him in her gloomy shades   deserted  abandoned  and forgotten by his unkind  ungrateful  countrymen  yet ever and anon  the remembrance of his goodness  and the  thought of those calamities in which I had involved him  recurred to  torment my soul  nor was the melancholy idea ever absent from the mind  of Jacqueline     Our excursions were prolonged to a tedious and oppressing length   Sometimes the heavy hand of fatigue and languor pressed sore upon my  dear companion  and called for all my care and tenderness  and these  were again amply repaid  when the violent and complicated griefs that  preyed upon my heart threatened me with some heavy malady  Thus  wandering on  and wearied in a fruitless search  chance rather than our  own determination led us to the sea coast  where the wide extended scene  displayed before me  awakened all my eager wisher to revisit England   Oftentimes did I cast my eyes forward toward that seat of honour and  security  and as oft did they turn back on France  as if in search of my  dear and injured friend  Not my own fortunes only were now the object of  my thoughts  Jacqueline  the child of my preserver  the partner of his  sorrows and his sufferings  demanded a share in my solicitude  I had  still gold to bribe the sailor to  convey us to a harbour of safety  I could not bear the thought of  leaving this precious pledge of friendship to the care of poor and  helpless followers  and yet my soul was pained  when I made an effort  to persuade her to seek refuge in an unknown country  and to resign her  last faint hopes of embracing a beloved parent  Here all my address was  employed  and every flattering suggestion urged to quiet her anxiety   All our disappointed enquiries I converted into arguments of the caution  and vigilance of Les Roches  which must have effectually concealed him  from the malice of his pursuers  I spoke of my own influence in the  English court  of the military power I could command  and conjured her  to rest assured that nothing was wanting for his protection but my  appearance in England  that there I could command authority and power  sufficient to support his rights  and redress his injuries  Her great  soul was animated with new vigour and resolution at the thoughts of  redress  and with a firmness which would have done honour to the bolder  sex  she freely consented to submit to my direction  and declared  herself ready to attend me     Our two followers  whose unwearied zeal had not yet lost sight of us   were now employed to procure a vessel to convey us from the land of  danger and oppression  as two pilgrims  engaged by solemn vows to visit  the lately erected shrine of St  Thomas of Canterbury  the same of which  had not been confined to England  Some days past in expectation of their  success  an interval which was employed in comforting my fair charge   and confirming her resolution  On the morning of a vernal day  we  wandered forth from the charitable cottage  that lately had received  us  to indulge our gentle conference without fear or controul  The sun  was climbing to his meridian height  and warned us to repose under the  shade of a steeply rising hill  whose trees nodded over us  and  embrowned the neighbouring plain  Here we had not long reclined  when  the noise of jocund mirth struck our ears   and called our attention to two travellers  who lay at some distance   sharing their friendly meal  I started  and listened to the well known  sounds  I heard my own native lays  sweetly rehearsing the renowned  deeds of Arthur valiant prince  the antient wars of Ambrose the Armoric  knight  and the triumphs of British valour  I melted into tears   such  are the tender emotions which the love of country raises in our breasts   then rushing impetuously towards the travellers  I gazed on them with  astonishment  they sprung from the ground  no less surprized  and I  embraced two of my dear countrymen  and late companions  They surveyed  me with joy and wonder  they acquainted me that their fellows were at  hand  they asked by what miracle I had been preserved  but I at once  stopped their enquiries by demanding to know the fate of Les Roches   Their cold and mournful looks at the mention of this name  chilled the  blood of Jacqueline  who had by this time joyned us   Say  said she  in  breathless agitation
