I could feel  all in a glow   And Oh  said he  mimicking  and snatching my other hand  as I would have run from him  and patting it  speaking thro  his closed teeth  You may be glad you have an hand lest  By my soul  I could eat you   This was your disconsolate  fallen spirited  Greville  Lucy   I rushed into the company in the next room  He followed me with an air altogether unconcerned  and begged to look at my hand  whispering to Mrs  Reeves  By Jupiter  said he  I had like to have eaten up your lovely cousin  I was beginning with her hand   I was more offended with this instance of his assureance and unconcern  than with the freedom itself  because that had the appearance of his usual gaiety with it  I thought it best  however  not to be too serious upon it  But the next time he gets me by himself  he shall eat up both my hands   At taking leave  he hoped his mad flight had not discomposed me  See  Miss Byron  said he  what you get by making an honest fellow desperate —But you insist upon my leaving the town  As a neighbour  as a well wisher  you advise it  madam  Come  come  don t be afraid of speaking after me  when I endeavour to hit your cue   I do advise you—  Conditions  remember  You know what you have declared—Angel of a woman  said he again thro  his shut teeth   I left him  and went up stairs  glad I had got rid of him   He has since seen Mr  Reeves  and told him  he will make me one visit more before he leaves London  And pray tell her  said he  that I have actually written to my brother tormentor Fenwick  that I am returning to Northamptonshire     140 I told you  that Miss Clements was with me when Sir Hargrave came last  I like her every time I see her  better than before  She has a sine understanding  and if languages  according to my grandfather s observation  need not be deemed an indispensable part of learning  she may be looked upon as learned   She has engaged me to breakfast with her to morrow morning  when she is to shew me her books  needleworks  and other curiosities  Shall I not fansy myself in my Lucy s closet  How continually  amid all this fluttering scene  do I think of my dear friends in Northamptonshire  Express for me love  duty  gratitude  every sentiment that fills the heart of  Your HARRIET BYRON   LETTER XXI  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   Tuesday Morning  Feb  14   I Have passed an agreeable two hours with Miss Clements  and am just returned  She is extremely ingenious  and perfectly unaffected  I am told  that she writes finely  and is a madame de Sevigne to her correspondents  I hope to be one of them  But she has not  I find  suffered her pen to run away with her needle  nor her reading to interfere with that housewifry which the best judges hold so indispensable in the character of a good woman   I revere her for this  as her example may be produced as one  in answer to such as object  I am afraid sometimes too justly  but I hope too generally  against learning in women  Methinks  however  I would not have learning the principal distinction of the woman I love  And yet  where talents are given  should we wish them to be either uncultivated or unacknowleged  Surely  Lucy  we may pronounce  that where no duty is neglected for the acquirement  where modesty    141 delicacy  and a teachable spirit  are preserved  as characteristics of the Sex  it need not be thought a disgrace to be supposed to know something   Miss Clements is happy  as well as your Harriet  in an aunt  that loves her  She has a mother living  who is too great a self lover  to regard any body else as she ought  She lives as far off as York  and was so unnatural a parent to this good child  that her aunt was not easy till she got her from her  Mrs  Wimburn looks upon her as her daughter  and intends to leave her all she is worth   The old Lady was not very well  but she obliged us with her agreeable company for half an hour   We agreed to fall in occasionally upon each other without ceremony   I should have told you  that the last master of the young man  William Wilson  having given him in writing a very good character  I have entertained him  and his first service was attending on me to Miss Clements   Lady Betty called here in my absence  She is  it seems  very full of the dresses  and mine in particular  But I must know nothing about it  as yet  We are to go to her house to dress  and to proceed from thence in chairs  She is to take care of every
