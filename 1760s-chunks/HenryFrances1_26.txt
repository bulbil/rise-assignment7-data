in Mind of a very just Remark of your s  upon a certain Occasion    That none but Cowards ever denied their being liable to Fear   And it was a noble Saying of Turenne to one of his Generals  who took Notice of an extraordinary Emotion  he observed in him  the Morning just before a desperate Engagement   This   77 Coward body trembles  at what the brave Soul dares this Day      I shall take Care to forward the Letters you inclosed to me last Post  and think they are wrote with that Sense and Virtue  which is so familiar to you  as to appear in your most ordinary Actions  I am fond of your good Wishes for their Happiness  as you justly limit it to their Merits  had you given them one Grain more  I should have been extremely angry  as it would have been impiously presuming to be more merciful than God himself  However  not to make too severe a Law against myself  I hope you will not deal so  Debtor and Creditor like  with  Your very sincere and affectionate Fanny   LETTER XLVII  Monday Morning  5 o Clock  HENRY to FRANCES   I AM just returned from performing my usual Ambarvalia in the Morning  and have roused all my Labourers to Work  except those who are ill  whom I have visited  and assisted both with Advice and Money  Sometimes    78 when I take these Rounds  I mend a Fence  drive Cattle out of their Gardens  and do many such little benevolent Offices  which are extremely pleasing in the Exercise  and flatter my Mind too  as if I was a Sort of Guardian Angel  assisting unseen  and watching over those that slept   When I am  as it were alone  awake among the Brute Creation  I feel myself  like Adam  sole Lord of this Globe  and this Reflection cautions me  from his Example    to take Heed lest I fall   In short  I have often looked upon early Hours to be as necessary to Virtue  as they are to Health  for I believe most Men are wicked  rather for Want of Reflection  than Want of Principle  and the charming Leisure  which Rising early affords for Contemplation  I take to be a great Help towards the Improvement both of Morals and Religion  How natural is true Devotion  when the Mind is at Liberty to reflect  with Gratitude and Admiration  upon the Bounties and Beauties of Providence  and I am very sure that the Seducer has infinitely more Power over a Man immersed in the World  than over one who has secluded himself from it  insomuch  that I never knew a very contemplative Man  a wicked one  since I have been capable to observe upon the Manners of Mankind  It is in such Retirement  that the Conscience has fair Play to exert itself  and   79 that a Man has Leisure  as it were  to con over his Lessons of Philosophy  Morality  and Religion  before he is called upon to repeat them  when the School of the World is met  by which Means  he must be more perfect in his Part  as he will have an Opportunity of getting it by Heart  before he has Occasion to put it in Practice     Oh  lost to Virtue  lost to manly Thought   Lost to the noble Sallies of the Soul   Who think it Solitude to be alone   Communion sweet  Communion large  and high   Our Reason  Guardian Angel  and our God   Then nearest these  when others more remote   And all  e re long  shall be remote  but these     Young s Night Thoughts   LETTER XLVIII  FRANCES to HENRY   YOUR Thoughts upon the Nature and Passion of Resentment  are philosophical and ingenious  and are wrote with that sensible Calmness  which I always admire in you  tho  I am sometimes provoked at it  In short  I have often thought it was your peculiar Happiness to have been blessed  by Providence  with a Judgment to direct you right  and an Heart to   80 pursue its Dictates  for you really do not seem to be born with a Spirit sufficient to actuate your Virtue without it   But  in Answer to your last Letter  I think  I may observe this  that you seem rather to argue against the Passion of Anger  than the Principle of Revenge  That we are to submit to the Vicissitudes of Fortune  with Chearfulness and Resignation  as they are presumed to be the Dispensations of Providence  who knows both what we are able  and what it may be for our Advantage to bear  is a Point we are both agreed in  but  whether we are to look upon those Misfortunes  which proceed from the Ingratitude  Perverseness  Envy  Hatred  or Malice of Mankind  as the Chastisement of Providence  so as to consider our Enemies as evil Agents  directed to good Purposes  as Divines tell us is sometimes the Case  is a Doctrine  which does not appear quite so plausible to my Understanding  Why may we not suppose  that human Frailty
