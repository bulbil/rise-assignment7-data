 he lays it out of his thoughts  and  as I have heretofore observed  rejoices in that of others  It is a pleasure to see how Sir Charles seems to enjoy the love which Dr  Bartlett expresses for his friend of them both   Sir Charles addressed himself to him  on several occasions  in so polite  in so tender a manner  that every One told me afterwards  they are sure he loves me  Dr  Bartlett at the time  as he sat next me  whispered  on the regret expressed by all on losing him so soon—Ah  madam —I know  and pity  my patron s struggles —Struggles  Lucy  What could the doctor mean by this whisper to me  But I hope he guesses not at mine  If he does  would he have whispered his pity of Sir Charles to me —Come  Lucy  this is some comfort  however  and I will endeavour to be brave upon it  that I may not  by my weakness  lessen myself in the doctor s good opinion   It was agreed for Charlotte  whose assent was given in these words—   Do as you will—or  rather  as my brother will —What signifies opposing him    that the nuptials shall be solemnized  as privately as possible  at St  George s church  The company is to drop in at different doors  and with as few attendants as may be  Lord W  the Earl of G  and Lady Gertrude  Lord and Lady L  Miss Jervois  and your Harriet  are to be present at the ceremony  I was very earnest to be excused  till Miss Grandison  when we were alone  dropt down on one knee  and held up her hands  to beg me to accompany her  Mr  Everard Grandison  if he can be found  is to be also there  at Sir Charles s desire     Dr  Bartlett  as I before hinted  at her earnest request  is to perform the ceremony  Sir Charles wished it to be at his own Parish church  But Miss   113 Grandison thought it too near to be private  He was indifferent as to the place▪ he said—So it was at church  for he had been told of the difficulty we had to get Charlotte to desist from having it performed in her chamber  and seemed surprised—Fie  Charlotte  said be—An office so solemn —Vows to re•eive and •ay as in the Divine Presence—  She was glad  she told me  that she had not left that battle to be fought with him   Monday  April 10   LORD W  is come  Lord and Lady L  are here  They  and Miss Grandison received him with great respect  He embraced his nieces in a very affectionate manner  Sir Charles was absent  Lord W  is in person and behaviour a much more agreeable man than I expected him to be  Nor is he so decrepit with the gout  as I had supposed  He is very careful of himself  it seems  This world has been kind to him  and I fancy he makes a great deal of a little pain  for want of stronger exercises to his patience  and so is a sufferer by self indulgence  Had I not been made acquainted with his free living  and with the insults he bore from Mrs  Giffard  with a spirit so poor and so low  I should have believed I saw not only the man of quality  but the man of sense  in his countenance  I endeavoured  however  as much as I could  to look upon him as the brother of the late Lady Grandison  Had he been worthy of that relation  how should I have reverenced him   But whatever I thought of him  he was highly taken with me  He particularly praised me for the modesty which he said was visible in my countenance  Free livers  Lucy  taken with that grace in a woman  which they make it their pride to destroy  But all men  good and bad  admire modesty in a woman  And I am sometimes out of humour with our sex  that they do not as generally like modesty in men  I am sure that this grace  in Sir Charles Grandison  is one of his principal glories   114 with me  It emboldens one s heart  and permits one to behave before him with ease  and  as I may say  with security  in the consciousness of a right intention   But what were Lord W s praises of his nephew  He called him  The glory of his sex  and of human nature  How the cheeks of the dear Emily glowed at the praises given to her guardian —She was the taller for them  When she moved  it was on tiptoe  stealing  as it were  cross the floor  lest she should lose any thing that was said on a subject to delightful to her   My Lord was greatly pleased with her too  He complimented her as the beloved ward of the best of guardians  He lamented  with us  the occasion that called his nephew abroad  He was full of his own engagements with Miss Mansfield  and declared that his nephew should
