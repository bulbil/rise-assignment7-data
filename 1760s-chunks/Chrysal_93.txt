him           Not a word  sir  nor has he spoken a syllable since  nor answered   any one question he has been asked          Ay  it is so  poor gentleman  it is so   And pray  sir  did he   make much resistance when you took him           The utmost he was able   but being better mounted  and much   stronger than he  I soon overpowered him  though not without   great danger   for  after I had him down  he drew his knife and   very narrowly missed plunging it into my body  You see what a out   it made in my coat and waistcoat           Ay  poor man  madness is always desperate  I fear  sir  you   have been too hasty in this afiair          How  sir  too hasty  to take a man in the very action of high    way robbery   I do not understand you  sir           Sir  I mean that this person is no robber  but an unhappy gentle    man of family and fortune  who has been for some time out of his   mind  I have been appUed to by his relations more than once  to   try to have him apprehended  that he might be confined   and  now   he is secvired  they wiU take proper care of him that he shall not   frighten anybody for the future   for I am satisfied  sir  that was all   he meant   and that he would not have taken your money had you   offered it to him  I suppose you searched him when you had over    powered him  poor man  as you justly termed it  Pray  sir  did   you find anything upon him to make you think he was a highway    man   Any watches  jewels  or different purses of money   or more   money than you might think it probable a person of his appearance   might commonly carry about him          No  really  sir  I did not find anything like what you mention    This purse which seems to have about thirty or forty guineas in it    for I have not reckoned them   was the only thing in all his pockets    except the knife which he drew on me   his pistols were openly in   his saddle  as gentlemen commonly wear them          Very well   and does not his present behaviour  and whole   conduct in this affair  convince you that the unhappy man could   have no felonious intent in his mad attack upon you   for men    mad as he is  have no intention at aU   and  without a felonious   intent  there can be no robbery   but I presume  you may under    stand something of the law yourself  sir           No  indeed  sir   I cannot say I know any more law than just   not to wrong any person  nor let them wrong me  if I can help it    as far as common sense will direct me  I thank God  I have spent         90 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     my days quietly in the coimtry  and never had a dispute with any   man in my life          Common sense  dear sir   common sense is a blind guide in matters   of law  Law and common sense are quite different things   but   as I was saying  sir  where there is no felonious intent  there can   be no felony   now robbery is punished only because it is felony    for so the indictment must be laid   fdonice  sir  fdonice  or it will   not do   The indictment will be quashed without that word     and who can charge a man with a felonious intent  who is disordered   in mind  and can have no intention at all    Tis true  the appear    ance was bad and sufficiently terrifying to authorize your apprehend    ing him   but  as you suffered neither loss nor hurt  I cannot suppose   that a gentleman of your humane appearance would desire to add   to the misery of his present unhappy condition  that of imprison    ment tin the next sessions  when he must be acquitted of course    as that would certainly make his madness for ever incurable  What    ever expense you have been at in bringing him here  I will take
