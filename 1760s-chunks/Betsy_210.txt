who professed themselves   her lovers          As little as Miss Betsy had accustomed herself to compare and judge of   things  she wanted not the power  whenever it pleased her to have the   will to do so  the words of Sir Frederick Fineer  on taking leave of her   at his last visit  sunk pretty deeply into her mind  nor could she   remember them without a mixture of surprize  resentment  and confusion    No man  excepting Mr  Saving  whose reasons for it she could not but   allow were justifiable  had hitherto ever presumed to make his addresses   to her in a clandestine manner  and Sir Frederick Fineer seemed to her    of all men  to have the least excuse for doing so  and she would not   have hesitated one moment to come into her brother Frank s opinion  that   he was no other than an impostor  if the dependance she had on the good   faith of Mrs  Modely had not prevented her from entertaining such a   belief       Besides  all the pleasure her gay young heart as yet had ever been   capable of taking in the conquests she had made  consisted in their   being known  and this proceeding in Sir Frederick was too mortifying to   that darling propensity  to be easily forgiven  even though he should   make it appear  that the motives on which he requested this secrecy were   such as could not be dispensed with        What can the man mean   said she   I suppose  by his desiring his   courtship to me should be a secret  he intends a marriage with me should   be so too  that I should live with him only as the slave of his loose   pleasures  and  though a lawful wife  pass me in the eyes of the world   for a kept mistress  Was ever such insolence  such an unparalleled   insult  both on my person and understanding  Heaven be my witness  that   it is only his quality could induce me  nay  I know not as yet whether   even that could be sufficient to induce me to become his wife  and can   he be so ridiculously vain as to imagine I would accept him on any   cheaper terms than that eclat his rank and fortune would bestow upon   me        She spent all that part of the night which she could spare from sleep    in meditating on this affair  and at last came to a resolution of seeing   him no more  whatever he might pretend in justification of his late   request       She also had it in her head to return unopened any letter he should   send  but curiosity prevailed above her resentment in this point  and   when his servant came in the morning  and presented her with his   master s compliments  and a billet at the same time  she had not the   power of denying herself the satisfaction of seeing what excuse he would   make  the contents of it were as follows             To the delight of my eyes  the life of my desires  the only        hope and joy of my adoring soul  the divine Miss Betsy Thoughtless            Since last I left your radiant presence  my mind has been all dark        and gloomy  my anxieties are unutterable  intolerable  I know not        what cruel constructions you may have put upon the petition I made        you  of not mentioning me to your brothers  but  sure  you cannot        think I apprehend a refusal from that quarter  no  my birth and        fortune set me above all doubts of that nature  and I am very        certain that both they  and all your kindred  would rather force        you  if in their power  to accept the hand I offer  but it is not        to them  but to yourself alone  I can submit to yield  Heaven  it        is true  is in possessing you  but then I would owe that heaven        only to your love  you may think  perhaps  that this is too great a        delicacy  but know  fair angel  that there is another motive  a        motive which  though derived from the same source  binds me in a        different way  Fain would I court you  fain marry you  with all the
