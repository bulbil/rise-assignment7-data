 and may the distress of thei minds  and uneasiness of their consciences  which  in justic to me  they have represented  be relieved  and subside  〈◊〉 my resentment has done  The supreme Judge sees a… hearts and motives  and to him I must submit the justic of my cause    When he had delivered these words  h came forward  and resolved to die with his face un¦covered  but  his friends representing that his look might possibly intimidate the soldiers  and preven their taking proper aim  he had his eyes bound wit an handkerchief  and  kneeling upon deck  the signa was given for the soldiers to fire  and he dropped dow dead in an instant     How far this unfortunate man was innocent  o culpable  we stand too near the transaction to judge if he erred in point of judgment only  it might have deen a proper cause for his dismission  but it would have been cruelty to condemn him for it  Those   213 who plead with the greatest vehemence against him  seem  however  at present  to bring their arguments from the necessity there was of making some one commander an example to give greater resolution to the rest  and from the good effects that seemed to attend his execution  by our repeated successes after it  These  however  are such reasons as may silence  but not satisfy  we must be contented therefore  to reflect tacitly upon this transaction  and to let posterity do the rest   I am   c   LETTER XXVI   EUROPE has often been compared to one republic obeying one law  namely  that of nations  and composed of provinces  each of which is prevented from becoming too great by the universal jealousy of the rest  A quarrel therefore between any two of these is apt to involve the whole in war  but  particularly  if the dispute happens to arise between those who are reckoned the leading powers in this assemblage of nations  A war begun between France and England  for a desart and trackless wild in the remote parts of Europe  seemed now spreading fast through the whole world  and the appearance of their commotions revived all the ancient jealousies and claims among the rest   The French  at the breaking out of this new war  though they were successful at its commencement  were very sensible that they could not long hold their acquisitions against such a superiority as the English were possessed of at sea  and the numberless resources they had of assisting their colonies with all the necessaries for war  Being therefore apprized that a naval war must  in the end  turn out to their disadvantage    214 they made no scruple of declaring that they would revenge the injuries they sustained in their colonies  or by sea  upon the King of England s territories in Germany  which they secretly hoped would be a motive to his complying with their demands  or dividing the English forces  or draining their finances with heavy subsidies  as they knew his affection for his native country  In these hopes they were not much disappointed  the court of London immediately  to secure the Electorate of Hanover  entered into a treaty with the Empress of Russia  by which a body of fifty five thousand men should be ready to act in the English service  in case Hanover should be invaded  for which the Russian Empress was to receive an hundred thousand pounds annually  to be paid in advance   His Prussian Majesty had long considered himself as the guardian of the interests of Germany  and was startled at the treaty  This was Frederic III  a Prince adorned with all the arts of peace  and whom you have seen also acting as the most consummate General  He had learned to read men  by being himself bred in the school of adversity  and to love his subjects  by having experienced their attachment  He therefore took the first opportunity to declare  that he would not suffer any foreign forces to enter the Empire  either as auxiliaries or principals  This consummate politician had  it seems  been already apprized of some secret negotiations between the Austrians  whom he looked upon as concealed enemies  and the Russians  for entering his dominions  and stripping him of the province of Silesia  which had been conceded to him in the last treaty of peace  His Britannic Majesty  whose fears for Hanover guided his present councils  now saw himself in the very situation he most dreaded  exposed to the resentments of France and Prussia  who could at once invade and over run his Electorate  while his Russian   215 allies lay at too great a distance to assist him  However  all he wished was to keep the enemy out of Germany  and this the King of Prussia made a profession of doing  as well as he  From the similitude of their intentions  therefore  these two Monarchs were induced to unite their interests  and  as they both only desired the same thing  they came to an agreement to assist each other mutually in keeping all foreign forces out of the Empire   From this alliance both powers hoped great advantages  the preserving the peace of Germany was the apparent good  but each had other peculiar benefits in view  The King
