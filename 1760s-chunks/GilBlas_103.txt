What is the matter  Gil Blas  said she with astonishment  what blue devil has perched upon your shoulder in my absence  You look gloomy and out of temper  My fairy queen  answered I  it is not without reason  you have an ugly kick in your gallop  I have observed you with the players         So  so  An admirable subject for a long face  interrupted she with a laugh  What  That is your trouble  is it  Why really  You are a very silly swain  but you will get better notions among us  You will fall by degrees into our easy manners  No jealousy  my dear creature  you will be completely laughed out of it in the theatrical world  The passion is scarcely known there  Fathers  husbands  brothers  uncles  and cousins  are all upon a liberal plan of community  and often make a strange jumble of relationships   After having warned me to take no umbrage  but to look at everything like a philosophical spectator  she vowed that I was the happy mortal who had found the way to her heart  She then declared that she should love me always  and only me  On this assurance  which a man might have doubted without criminal scepticism  I promised her not to be alarmed any more  and kept my word  I saw her  on that very evening  whisper and giggle with more men than one  At the end of the play we returned home with our mistress  whither Florimonde came soon after to supper  with three old noblemen and a player  Besides Laura and myself  the establishment consisted of a cook maid  a coachman  and a little footboy  We all laboured in our respective vocations  The lady of the frying pan  no less an adept than Dame Jacintha  was assisted in her cookery by the coachman  The waiting woman and the little footboy laid the cloth  and I set out the sideboard  magnificently furnished with plate  offered up at the shrine of our green room goddess  There was every variety of wines  and I played the cup bearer  to show my mistress the versatility of my talents  I sweated at the impudence of the actresses during supper  they gave themselves quality airs  and affected the tone of high life  Far from giving their guests all their style and titles  they did not even vouchsafe a simple  Your lordship   but called them familiarly by their proper names  To be sure  the old fools encouraged their vanity by forgetting their own distance  The player  for his part  in the habits of the heroic cast  lived on equal terms with them  he challenged them to drink  and in every respect took the upper hand  In good truth  said I to myself  while Laura was demonstrating the equality of the Marquis and the comedian during the day  she might have drawn a still stronger inference for the night  since they pass it so merrily in drinking together   Arsenia and Florimonde were naturally frolicsome  A thousand broad hints escaped them  intermingled with small favours  and then a coquettish revolt at their own freedom  which were all seasoned exactly to the taste of these old sinners  While my mistress was entertaining one of them with a little harmless toying  her friend  between the other elders  had not taken the cue of Susanna  While I was contemplating this picture  which had but too many attractions for a knowing youth like me  the dessert was brought in  Then I set the bottles and glasses on the table  and made my escape to sup with Laura  who was waiting for me  How now  Gil Blas  said she  what do you think of those noblemen above stairs  Doubtless  answered I  they are deeply smitten with Arsenia and Florimonde  No  replied she  they are old sensualists  who hang about our sex without any particular attachment  All they ask is some little frivolous compliance  and they are generous enough to pay well for the least trifle of amorous endearment  Heaven be praised  Florimonde and my mistress are at present without any serious engagements  I mean that they have no husband like lovers  who expect to engross all the pleasures of a house  because they stand to the expenses  For my part  I am very glad of it  and maintain that a sensible woman of the world ought to refuse all such monopolies  Why take a master  It is better to support an establishment by retail trade  than to confine one s self to chamber practice on such terms   When Laura s tongue was wound up  and it was seldom down  words seemed to cost her nothing  What a glorious volubility  She told a thousand stories of the actresses belonging to the prince s company  and I gathered from her whole drift that I could not be better situated to take a scientific view of the cardinal vices  Unfortunately I was at an age when they inspire but little horror  and this abigail had the art of colouring her corruptions so lusciously as to hide their deformities and heighten their meretricious lure  She had not time to open the tenth part of her theatrical budget  for she did
