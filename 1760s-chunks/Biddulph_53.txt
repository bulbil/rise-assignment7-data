the country  to obtain her uncle’s consent for the intended visit  She says  she can easily tell him she made an acquaintance with lady Bidulph in her late excursion to Bath  from whom she received an invitation  and she is sure he will not refuse to let her accept it   Sir George laughs exceedingly at this plan  He says his mother ought not to be surprized at Faulkland’s falling into the girl’s snares  since she herself has done the same  but he supposes my mother thinks she is doing a very meritorious action  in affording an asylum to this injured innocence  I give you my brother’s words  for I assure you  as to myself  I approve of my mother’s kindness to her  and think it may be a means of preserving the girl from future mischief   April 2  Miss Burchell is gone to the country  and this morning  for the first time  severed me from the best of mothers  I cannot recover my spirits  I have wept all day  Mr Arnold  ever good and obliging  would needs accompany her some miles on her journey  you may be sure I was not left behind  Sir George was so polite as to say  He would escort her down to Sidney castle  I was surprized at it  for he does not often do obliging things  My mother gladly accepted of his company  and said  she would make him her prisoner  when she had him there  for she should be quite melancholy without me for a time  Now though I should be very unwilling not to allow the merit of a good natured action to Sir George  yet do I attribute this in some measure to its answering a purpose of convenience to himself  You    know  before his illness sent him to the Spa  he always spent his summers with us at the Castle  though he has another very convenient house on his estate  When he was in London  he never had any thing but lodgings  for which I have often been angry with him  My mother  since his return  made him a compliment of her house  but as the time she took it for is now expired  and it is let to another family  he could no longer continue in it  Mr Arnold  in the most affectionate manner  pressed him to accept of an apartment with us  which he declined  Now as he could not  without shewing us an apparent slight  continue in town in other lodgings  I believe he  for this reason  preferred going down with my mother  Be it as it may  I am very glad that she will have his company  for I make no doubt of his staying with her some time  unless Miss Burchell should frighten him away   April 5  I have been so cast down since my mother’s departure  that Mr Arnold’s obliging tender assiduity to please and entertain me seems redoubled  but indeed I am wearied with a continual round of noisy pleasures  and long to get back to Arnold abbey  I hope to be there in about three weeks  or a month at farthest  My mother has dispensed with our going down to her this summer  She thinks it might be attended with inconveniences to me  and talks of coming to town again in a few months  but I shall insist on her not giving herself the fatigue of so long a journey  unless she comes to stay all the next winter with us   April 20  My mother writes me word that Miss Burchell has obtained leave of her uncle  and is come to Sidney castle  she says  she never saw a better behaved young creature  Sir George has taken so much offence at her coming  that he talks of going to his own house  My mother adds  ‘He behaves however  with manners  but I shall not press him to stay ’  May 6  An important birth  my Cecilia  the widow Arnold has produced a young miss  I assure you the little damsel has been ushered into life with all the ceremony due to a young heiress  and her mother introduces her as one  whom an unjust uncle debars of her right     Now you must know  that upon an exact calculation  this little girl has made her appearance just twelve days later than she ought to have done  to prove her legitimacy  dating the possibility of her being Mr Arnold’s  from the very day whereon he took that illness of which he died  and which confined him for five days to his bed  In all that time  his servants never left him for a minute  this has occasioned various speculations  our lawyers say that it is enough to destroy her pretensions  but some physicians  who have been consulted on the occasion  are of a contrary opinion  and declare they have known instances of children being born  even so long after the stated time alloted by nature for their coming into life   It is a very unlucky affair  and has involved us in a law suit  Who the person is that secretly abets the widow  we cannot find out  but it is certain she has somebody  every one believes this is an infamous and unjust claim  and the
