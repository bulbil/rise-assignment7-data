rather seem the effect   of her insensibility  than judgment or affection       26  That the words COMMAND and OBEY shall be blotted out of the   Vocabulary  Very good       27  That a man should desire nothing of his wife  but what is   significant  reasonable  just  To be sure  that is right       28  But then  that she must not shew reluctance  uneasiness  or doubt    to oblige him  and that too at half a word  and must not be bid twice to   do one thing  But may not there be some occasions  where this may be a   little dispensed with  But he says afterwards  indeed       29  That this must be only while he took care to make her compliance   reasonable  and consistent with her free agency  in points that ought to   be allowed her  Come  this is pretty well  considering       30  That if the husband be set upon a wrong thing  she must not dispute   with him  but do it and  expostulate afterwards  Good sirs  I don t know   what to say to this  It looks a little hard  methinks  This would bear a   smart debate  I fancy  in a parliament of women  But then he says       31  Supposing they are only small points that are in dispute  Well  this   mends it a little  For small points  I think  should not be stood upon       32  That the greatest quarrels among friends  and wives and husbands   are  or should be  friends  arise from small matters  I believe this is   very true  for I had like to have had anger here  when I intended very   well       33  That a wife should not desire to convince her husband for   CONTRADICTION sake  but for HIS OWN  As both will find their account in   this  if one does  I believe  tis very just       34  That in all companies a wife must shew respect and love to her   husband       35  And this for the sake of her own reputation and security  for       36  That rakes cannot have a greater encouragement to attempt a married   lady s virtue  than her slight opinion of her husband  To be sure this   stands to reason  and is a fine lesson       37  That a wife should therefore draw a kind veil over her husband s   faults       38  That such as she could not conceal  she should extenuate       39  That his virtues she should place in an advantageous light      40  And shew the world  that he had HER good opinion at least       41  That she must value his friends for his sake       42  That she must be cheerful and easy in her behaviour  to whomsoever   he brings home with him       43  That whatever faults she sees in him  she never blame him before   company       44  At least  with such an air of superiority  as if she had a less   opinion of his judgment than her own       45  That a man of nice observation cannot be contented to be only   moderately happy in a wife       46  That a wife take care how she ascribe supererogatory merit to   herself  so as to take the faults of others upon her       Indeed  I think it is well if we can bear our own  This is of the same   nature with the third  and touches upon me  on the present occasion  for   this wholesome lecture       47  That his imperfections must not be a plea for hers  To be sure   tis   no matter how good the women are  but  tis to be hoped men will allow a   little  But  indeed  he says       48  That a husband  who expects all this  is to be incapable of   returning insult for obligation  or evil for good  and ought not to   abridge her of any privilege of her sex          Well  my dear parents  I think this last rule crowns the rest  and makes   them all very tolerable  and a generous man  and a man of sense  cannot   be too much obliged  And  as I have this happiness  I shall be very   unworthy  if I do not always so think  and so act
