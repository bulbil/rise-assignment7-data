 at  her request  offered his service to our hero  in defeating the projects  of his adversaries   Peregrine was startled when he read the particulars of their scheme   which was no other than an intention to sally upon him when he should  be altogether unprovided against such an attack  cut off his ears  and  otherwise mutilate him in such a manner that he should have no cause  to be vain of his person for the future  Incensed as he was against  the brutal disposition of his own father s son  he could not help  being moved at the integrity and tenderness of his sister  of whose  inclinations towards him he had been hitherto kept in ignorance  He  thanked the gentleman for his honourable dealing  and expressed a desire  of being better acquainted with his virtues  told him that now he was  cautioned  he hoped there would be no necessity for giving him any  further trouble  and wrote by him a letter of acknowledgment to his  sister  for whom he expressed the utmost love and regard  beseeching  her to favour him with an interview before his departure  that he might  indulge his fraternal fondness  and be blessed with the company and  countenance of one at least belonging to his own family  Having imparted  this discovery to his friend Hatchway  they came to a resolution of  countermining the plan of their enemies  As they did not choose to  expose themselves to the insinuations of slander  which would have  exerted itself at their expense  had they  even in defending themselves   employed any harsh means of retaliation  they invented a method of  disappointing and disgracing their foes  and immediately set Pipes at  work to forward the preparations  Miss Pickle having described the spot  which the assassins had pitched upon for the scene of their vengeance   our triumvirate intended to have placed a sentinel among the corn  who  should come and give them intelligence when the ambuscade was laid  and   in consequence of that information  they would steal softly towards the  place  attended by three or four of the domestics  and draw a large  net over the conspirators  who  being entangled in the toil  should be  disarmed  fettered  heartily scourged  and suspended between two trees  in the snare  as a spectacle to all passengers that should chance to  travel that way   The plan being thus digested  and the commodore acquainted with the  whole affair  the spy was sent upon duty  and everybody within doors    6 22 15  3 45 PM   prepared to go forth upon the first notice  One whole evening did they  spend in the most impatient expectation  but on the second the scout  crept into the garrison  and assured them that he had perceived three  men skulking behind the hedge  on the road that led to the public house  from which Peregrine and the lieutenant used every night to return about  that hour  Upon this intelligence the confederates set out immediately  with all their implements  Approaching the scene with as little noise as  possible  they heard the sound of blows  and  though the night was  dark  perceived a sort of tumultuous conflict on the very spot which the  conspirators had possessed  Surprised at this occurrence  the meaning of  which he could not comprehend  Peregrine ordered his myrmidons to  halt and reconnoitre  and immediately his ears were saluted with an  exclamation of  You shan t  scape me  rascal   The voice being quite  familiar to him  he at once divined the cause of that confusion which  they had observed  and running up to the assistance of the exclaimer   found a fellow on his knees begging his life of Mr  Gauntlet  who stood  over him with a naked hanger in his hand   Pickle instantly made himself known to his friend  who told him  that  having left his horse at Tunley s  he was  in his way to the garrison   set upon by three ruffians  one of whom being the very individual person  now in his power  had come behind him  and struck with a bludgeon at  his head  which  however  he missed  and the instrument descended on his  left shoulder  that  upon drawing his hanger  and laying about him  in the dark  the other two fled  leaving their companion  whom he had  disabled  in the lurch   Peregrine congratulated him on his safety  and having ordered Pipes to  secure the prisoner  conducted Mr  Gauntlet to the garrison  where he  met with a very hearty reception from the commodore  to whom he was  introduced as his nephew s intimate friend  not but that  in all  likelihood  he would have abated somewhat of his hospitality had he  known that he was the brother of Perry s mistress  but her name the  old gentleman had never thought of asking  when he inquired into the  particulars of his godson s amour   The captive being examined  in presence of Trunnion and all his  adherents  touching the ambuscade  owned that being in
