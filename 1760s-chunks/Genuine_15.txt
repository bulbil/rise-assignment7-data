 but something more durable  which is money  sensible that a destitution of this necessary ingredient in the portion of a wife always entails cares  and too often discord  that bane of the nuptial union  The second class seldom requires any other qualification in the fair one  than beauty  though wit is frequently deemed a very agreeable quality in a mistress  unless the lover is deficient in it himself  or imagines his charmer has too great a share  and consequently distrusts her employing it to bad purposes against himself  With respect to the third sort  called danglers  their vanity is raised in proportion to the endowments possessed by the Lady they profess to admire  and these generally may be gratified in their highest expectations  without prejudice to a woman s   71 honour or virtue  provided she is well assured that the person  who appears to be a mere dangler  is not in reality a hypocrite   Now  though Miss ELLIOT soon met with several of the latter class of admirers  the cause cannot be assigned why she had neither of the two former  till some time after her first appearance in places of public resort  unless it may be attributed to the uncertainty of her fortune amongst those men of honour  who would have approved of her as a wife  or  to that which is more common  a tenderness for her person and years  among those rakes  who  though they could not relish matrimony  would gladly have embraced her as a mistress   Tired with a long and fruitless search after some lover  who was both able and willing to make her a handsome compensation in return for her favours  she one day took a solitary walk in Kensington gardens  She sat down on a green bench  reclined her head on her arm  and was very thoughtful  She was much surprised by a gentleman s accosting her with    72  Pretty Miss  permit me the honour of sitting by you   She turned her head to see who it was that accosted her  and was agreeably surprised to find it was a person  who  by his air  seemed entirely adapted to her purpose  She therefore  very politely desired him to sit down  and a few minutes conversation so captivated his affection  that an interview was presently agreed on at her lodgings  to which she gave him proper directions  and whither he repaired the following day in the afternoon     This new lover was no other than commodore H—y  nephew to the right honourable l— B—  he was so highly charmed with her conversation at this first visit  that he staid all night with her  and  before they parted  easily gained her consent to live with him as a mistress  and accordingly settled on her an annuity of 500 l  per annum  presenting her at the same time with a gold watch and a diamond necklace   No woman  in Miss ELLIOT S way of life  ever lived more happy or content than   73 she did for two years that she was in keeping with this gentleman  He was passionately fond of her  and was continually racking his invention to find out new ways of pleasing her  She was sole mistress of his house  regarded by all the servants as their mistress  and they were told by the commodore  that whatever Miss ELLIOT ordered them to do  was to be complied with as punctually as though he himself had commanded it   Our heroine  who now moved in a higher sphere than she had ever done before  was caressed by all the commodore s friends and acquaintance  who all seemed to take a pleasure in daily giving her fresh proofs of their friendship and esteem  She was envied by all her acquaintance  both male and female  by the men  who lamented their cruel destiny that denied the enjoyment of her adorable person  and by women of her own stamp  who often sighed to experience the same happiness she enjoyed   About this time her sister FANNY  who had unluckily made a false step at Tunbridge    74 came to London  in hopes of procuring a genteel livelihood by the traffic of those charms which nature had bestowed on her almost with as much profusion as on Miss ELLIOT  She had not been in London above a fortnight  before she was taken notice of by Mr  —  master of the G—n c—ss Inn at Charing cross  on whom her beauty made so deep an impression  that having learned the place of her abode  he visited her  and being equally charmed with her good sense  and engaging conversation  he determined to take her home to live with him  which offer  being disengaged from any other lover  she accepted of with the greatest joy   She did not  however  long enjoy her present good fortune  for being discovered to have been a little too free with one of the waiters  she was immediately dismissed from the house of her keeper  who loaded her with reproaches for her infidelity to him   She immediately had recourse to Miss ELLIOT  who seeing her distress  allowed   75 her a weekly stipend  sufficient to keep her handsomely  and at the same time undertook the arduous  though pleasing task of instructing her in
