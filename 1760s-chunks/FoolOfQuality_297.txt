  laugh be as though they laughed not  remembering that they must   weep   and provided that those who weep be as though they wept   not  having joy in their knowledge that the fashion of this world   quickly passeth away      On the following day  Mr  Fenton returned to Hampstead  leaving   Harry and Mr  Clement ability to indulge the benevolence of their   hearts      One evening  as our companions were drinking tea in the Temple   Exchange Coffee house  a man  advanced in years but of a very   respectable appearance  got up and addressed the assembly       Gentlemen  said he  among the several hospitals and other charit    able foundations that have done honour to the humanity of the   inhabitants of this city  there is one still wanting which  as I con    ceive  above all others  would give distinction to the beneficence of   its founders   it is a house for repenting prostitutes  an asylum for   unhappy wretches who have no other home to whom all doors   are shut  to whom no haven is open  no habitation or hole for rest   upon the face of the earth      Most of them have been seduced from native innocence and   modesty by the arts of cruel men  Many have been deceived under   promise and vows of marriage   some under the appearance of the   actual ceremony  and afterwards abandoned or turned forth to   infamy by their barbarous and base undoers  Shall no place  then    be left for repentance  even to those who do repent  Forbid it    charity   forbid it  manhood   Man is born the natural protector of   the weakness of woman   and  if he has not been able to guard her   innocence from invasion  he ought at least to provide a reception   for her return to virtue          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  323     I have the plan of this charitable foundation in my pocket   and   if any of you gentlemen approve my proposal  and are willing to   subscribe  or to solicit your friends to so beneficent a purpose  I   request your company to the tavern over the way      Here the speaker walked toward the door  and was followed   by Harry and Clement  and thirteen or fourteen more of the   assembly      When the company was seated round a large table  the gentleman   produced his plan  with a summary of the rules and institutes for   the conduct of the house  which he proposed to call the Magdalene   House   a plan which hath since been espoused and happily   executed by others  without ascribing any of the merit to the first   projector      As all present applauded the manner of the scheme and intention   of the charity  each of them subscribed from a hundred to twenty   pounds  till it came to Harry s turn  who subscribed a thousand   pounds in Mr  Teuton s name      I suppose  sir  said one of the company  that your largest contri    butions will arise from the ladies  as the whole is intended for the   benefit of the sex  I shall not  answered the gentleman  apply to a   single lady on this occasion  Not one of them will dare to con    tribute a penny  lest it should be thought that they partly allow in   themselves the vices that they can pardon or patronize in others    It is this that makes the case of the wretches whom we are about   to befriend  deplorable beyond measure  They are first betrayed   by our sex  and then driven out to irretrievable infamy and misery   by their own  For women to women are as turkeys to turkeys   do   but cast a little dirt upon the head of any one of them  and the rest   of the flock combine in an instant to pick out her eyes and to tear   her to pieces      Mr  Mole  a learned philosopher  and a man of principal figure   in the present company  then addressed the projector  and said If   you will admit me  sir  into partnership in the conduct of your   scheme  I will engage to levy contributions to the amount of some   thousands over and above the hundred I have already subscribed    You are heartily welcome  sir  replied the gentleman  either to   join or take the conduct of the whole upon yourself   provided the   good is done  I care not by what means  All my ends will be   answered   I wish to be nameless  That is not fair  neither  said   another of the company
