with blood  and just expiring  No tears streamed down my cheeks  nor sigh escaped from my breast  at an object of such terror  I sat down  and supporting his aged head in my lap  gazed upon the gastly visage with an agony more poignant even than despairing madness  The servants were gone for more assistance  In this gloomy stillness of the night no sounds were heard but his agonizing respirations  no object was presented but his wounds  which still continued to stream  With silent anguish I hung over his dear face  and with my hands strove to stop the blood as it flowed from his wounds  he seemed at first insensible  but at last turning his dying eyes upon me   My dear  dear child  cried he  dear  though you have forgotten your own honour and stained mine  I will yet forgive you  by abandoning virtue you have undone me and yourself  yet take my forgiveness with the same compassion I wish heaven may pity me   He expired  All my succeeding happiness fled with him  Reflecting that I was the cause of his death whom only I loved upon earth  accused of betraying the honour of his family with his latest breath  conscious of my own innocence  yet without even a possibility of vindicating it    262 without fortune or friends to relieve or pity me  abandoned to infamy and the wide censuring world  I called out upon the dead body that lay stretched before me  and in the agony of my heart asked why he could have left me thus  Why  my dear  my only pappa  why could you ruin me thus and yourself for ever  O pity  and return  since there is none but you to comfort me   I soon found that I had real cause for sorrow  that I was to expect no compassion from my own sex  nor assistance from the other  and that reputation was much more useful in our commerce with mankind than really to deserve it  Wherever I came  I perceived myself received either with contempt or detestation  or whenever I was civilly treated  it was from the most base and ungenerous motives   Thus driven from the society of the virtuous  I was at last  in order to dispell the anxieties of insupportable solitude  obliged to take up with the company of those whose characters were blasted like my own  but who perhaps deserved their infamy  Among this number was a lady of the first distinction  whose character the public thought proper to brand even with greater infamy than mine  A similitude of distress soon united us  I knew that general reproach had made her miserable  and I had learned to regard misery as an excuse for guilt  Though this lady had not virtue enough to avoid reproach  yet she had too much delicate sensibility not to feel it  She therefore proposed our leaving the country where we were born  and going to live in Italy  where our charactets and misfortunes would be unknown    263 With this I eagerly complied  and we soon found ourselves in one of the most charming retreats in the most beautiful province of that inchanting country   Had my companion chosen this as a retreat for injured virtue  an harbour where we might look with tranquility on the distant angry world  I should have been happy  but very different was her design  she had pitch d upon this situation only to enjoy those pleasures in private  which she had not sufficient effrontery to satisfy in a more open manner  A nearer acquaintance soon shewed me the vicious part of her character  her mind as well as her body seemed formed only for pleasure  she was sentimental only as it served to protract the immediate enjoyment  Formed for society alone  she spoke infinitely better than she wrote  and wrote infinitely better than she lived  A person devoted to pleasure often leads the most miserable life imaginable  such was her case  she considered the natural moments of languor as insupportable  passed all her hours between rapture and anxiety  ever in an extreme of agony or of bliss  She felt a pain as sincere for want of appetite  as the starving wretch who wants a meal  In those intervals she usually kept her bed  and rose only when in expectation of some new enjoyment  The luxuriant air of the country  the romantic situation of her palace  and the genius of a people whose only happiness lies in sensual refinement  all contributed to banish the remembrance of her native country   But tho  such a life gave her pleasure  it had a very different effect upon me  I grew every   264 day more pensive  and my melancholy was regarded as an insult upon her good humour  I now perceived myself entirely unfit for all society  discarded from the good  and detesting the infamous  I seemed in a state of war with every rank of people  that virtue which should have been my protection in the world  was here my crime  in short  detesting life  I was determined to become a recluse  to leave a world where I found no pleasure that could allure me to stay  Thus determined  I embarked in order to go by sea to Rome  where I intended to take the veil  but even in
