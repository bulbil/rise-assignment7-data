 my dear Lady G  on the arrival of your brother  I do not wonder that his fatigues  and his disappointment  have made an alteration in his person and countenance  Sir Charles Grandison would not be the man he is  if he had not sensibility   You could not know your brother  my dear  if you expected from him recriminations on your past odd Page  284 behaviour to Lord G  I hope he does not yet know a tenth part of it  But if he did  as he hoped you saw your error  and would be good for the future  he was right surely to forget  what you ought not  but with contrition  to remember  You are very naughty in the Letter before me  and I love you too well to spare you   What can you mean  my dear  by exulting so much over your aunt  for living  to an advanced age  a single woman  However ineffectual  let me add to my former expostulatory chidings on this subject  Would you have one think you are overjoyed  that you have so soon put it out of any one s power to reproach you on the like account  If so  you ought to be more thankful than you seem to be  to Lord G  who has extended his generosity to you  and kept you from the odium  Upon my word  my dear Lady G  I think it looks like a want of decency in women  to cast reflexions on others of their Sex  possibly for their prudence and virtue  Do you consider  how you exalt  by your ludicrous freedoms  the men whom sometimes you affect to despise  No wonder if they ridicule old maids  It is their interest to do so  Lords of the Creation  sometimes you deridingly call the insulters  Lords of the Creation  indeed you make them —And pray  do you think  that the same weakness which made your aunt Grandison tell her dreams  in the joy of her heart  as an old maid  might not have made her guilty of the same foible  had she been an old wife  Joy is the parent of many a silly thing  Don t you own  that the arrival of your brother  which made your aunt break out into dream telling  made you break into laughter  even in a Letter  of which you were ashamed to tell the cause —Wives  my dear  should not sall into the mistakes  for which they would make maids the subject of their ridicule  You know better  and therefore should be above joining the foolish multitude  in a general cry to hunt down  as you reckon Page  285 them  an unfortunate class of people of your own Sex  Your aunt Grandison s dreams  let me add  were more innocent than your weaking mirth—You must excuse me—I could say a great deal more upon the subject  but if I have not said enough to make you sorry for your fault  a great deal more would be ineffectual—So much therefore for this subject   Poor dear Emily —I wonder not at the effect the arrival  and first sight  of her guardian  had upon her tender heart   But how wickedly do you treat your Lord —Fie upon you  Charlotte —And fie upon you again  for writing what I cannot  for your credit sake  read out to my friends  I wish  my dear  I could bring you to think  that there cannot be wit without justice  nor humour without decorum  My Lord has some few foibles  But shall a wife be the first to discover them  and expose him for them  Cannot you cure him of them  without treating him with a ridicule which borders upon contempt —O my dear  you shew us much greater foibles in yourself  than my Lord ever yet had  when you make so bad an use of talents that were given you for better purposes  One word only more on this subject—You cannot make me smile  my dear  when you are thus unseasonable in your mirth  Henceforth  then  remember  that your excursiveness  allow me the word  I had a harsher in my head  upon old maids  and your Lord  can only please yourself  and I will not accept of your compliment  Why  Because I will not be a partaker in your fault  as I should be  if I could countenance your levity   Levity  Harriet   Yes  levity  Charlotte—I will not spare you  Whom do you spare   But do you really think me so ill as you represented me to be  to your brother  I don t think I am  If I did  I am sure I should endeavour to put my thoughts in an absolutely new train  Nor would I quit the hold Page  286 which at proper times  I do let go  to re enter the world  as an individual  who imagines herself of some little use in it  and who is therefore obliged to perform  with chearfulness  her allotted offices  however generally insignificant I may comparatively be   You say  you had no thoughts of exciting your brother s attention  by your strong colouring  when you described the effects of my indisposition to
