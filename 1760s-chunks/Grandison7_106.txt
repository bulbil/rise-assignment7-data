so good as to favour me with a line to acquaint me with the actual celebration  that I may ground upon in my earliest felicitations   I will proceed with an account of what so much engages the attention of every one here   I told you in one of my former  that Lady G  had shewn to Mrs  Beaumont Lucy s account of the conversation held at Shirley manor  on the subject of a first Love  with Lady G s sprightly decision upon it  and upon the appeal made to me —I must now tell you  that Mrs  Beaumont prevailed upon Lady Clementina to desire me to read it to her  She made her request  and I obeyed  Mrs  Beaumont was present  Not a word by way of application did either she or I suggest  when I had done reading  Lady Clementina s complexion often changed as I read  She was not at all diverted with those lively parts of Lady G s decision  that I ventured to read  tho  she is an admirer of her sprightly vein  She looked down most of the time in solemn silence  And at last  when I had ended  she  sighing  started  as if from a resverie  arose  courtesied  and withdrew  not having once opened her lips on the subject     273 THE Bishop  Signor Jeronymo  and the two young Lords  just now joined to request Sir Charles to become avowedly an advocate for the Count to Lady Clementina  They urged  that she was ballancing in his favour  and that Sir Charles s weight would turn the scale  But Sir Charles not only desired to be excused  but begged that she might not be solicited by any body on that subject—May she not  asked he  by reasoning with herself  and considering what she can do  with justice to the Count and herself  Her future peace of mind is concerned that her determination now  shall be all her own  Leave her no room for after regret  for having been persuaded against her mind  If persuasion only is wanting  will she not wrap herself up in reserve  to keep herself in countenance for not having been persuaded before   Pursuant to this advice  the Marchioness in a conversation with her beloved daughter  that might have led to the subject on which their hearts are fixed  declined it  saying  Whatever my child shall determine upon  with regard to any plan for her future life  let her whole heart be in it  her choice shall be ours   Thursday Afternoon   LADY Clementina excused herself from breakfasting with us  but obliged us with her Company at dinner  At  and after dinner  Sir Charles directed himself to all the company  in turn  in his usual agreeable manner  How does his benign countenance always shine when he finds himself surrounded at table by his friends the larger the circle  the more diffused is his chearfulness  With what delight does his Jeronymo meditate his every graceful motion  He dwells upon what he says  and by his eyes cast with less complaceney on an interrupter  seems to wish every one silent  when Sir Charles s lips begin to open     274 After he had gone round his ample table  saying something obliging to all  in a manner calling forth every one  to say something in his or her own way  he addressed himself more particularly to the Count  and led him into subjects both learned and familiar  in which he knew he could shine  and in which he d d  It was doubly kind in Sir Charles to do so  for the poor man s reverence for the mistress of his fate  had taken all courage from his love  and he wanted to be drawn out  Never can bashful merit appear to so much advantage  as in Sir Charles s address to it   How much soul did Lady Clementina shew in her eyes  she was very attentive to every one that spoke  She asked the Count questions more than once on some of the subjects he was led to talk of  My eyes  as I could feel  glistened when she did  to see how those of her father and mother rejoiced  as I may say  on the notice she took of him  Lady Clementina could not but observe how delightfully her complaisance to the Count was received by all her family—Is it possible  thought I  more than once  were I in the situation of this admirable Lady  to avoid obliging such indulgent parents with the grant of all their wishes  that depended on myself  having given up voluntarily the man I preferred to all others   Signor Sebastiano dropt a hint once  of his own  and the Count s  and Signor Juliano s intention of setting out  mentioning a care for their baggage  which by this time  he supposed  had reached Dover  But Clementina turning an attentive ear to what he said  Sir Charles was afraid she would take this hint as a design to hasten her resolution  and said  We will not sadden our hearts with the thoughts of parting with any of our friends   Thursday Evening  Eight o Clock   A LETTER is this moment brought from town by an especial Messenger
