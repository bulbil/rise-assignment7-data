England  but not her claim of succeeding to the throne  this renunciation  however  being extorted from her by Elizabeth  Mary took every method of disturbing her in the quiet possession of the crown  and yet gave every mark of reconciliation and sincere amity  There were  in fact  many circumstances to contribute to their mutual dislike  the jealousy of neighbouring crowns  the opposition of religion  of wit  and of beauty  Mary  less powerful  less absolute  less politic  was  however  Elizabeth s   282 superior in personal charms  and this only served to inflame their animosity  The Queen of Scotland encouraged the Catholic faction in England  while Elizabeth  with still more success  fomented the Protestant party among the Scots  Mary had now  for some time  thoughts of marrying a second husband  after the death of the French King  Elizabeth  on the other hand  who had no thoughts of marriage herself  strove  by every art  to prevent this marriage  as she considered that it would be strengthening the power of her rival  With this view she wrote Mary a letter  in which  after many insincere protestations of friendship  she begged that Mary would not offer to marry till her consent should first be obtained  This unreasonable request not a little disturbed the Queen of Scotland  but  fearing to offend her potent rival  she pretended to comply  in secret  however  she was resolved to marry the Earl of Darnly  her relation  who had the merit of being a Catholic  like herself  but  perhaps  whose greatest recommendations were his size and his person  which were large and comely  The party gained by Elizabeth  in Scotland  tried every measure to prevent her design  It was agitated  whether the Queen could marry without the consent of the states  several of the nobility rose in arms to prevent it  the ambassadors of England made daily remonstrances upon its impropriety  but all in vain  Mary  to cut short their proceedings  had the marriage solemnized in her own chapel  and banished the opposers by a solemn act of the states   All hitherto appeared fortunate for Mary  her enemies banished  her rival defeated  and herself married to the man she loved  yet this was but a flattering calm  for soon  whether from the capriciousness   283 of her temper  or from what other cause I will not pretend to determine  Lord Darnly  notwithstanding the elegance of his person  became entirely disagreeable to her  She had conceived such an aversion to him  that it was soon obvious  even to the people  and she took every method to mortify him in the eyes of the public  Her vices were the cause of all her misfortunes  there was  at that time in her court  one David Rizzio  the son of a musician at Turin  who had followed the ambassador from that court into Scotland  As he understood music to perfection  and sung a good bass  he was introduced into the Queen s concert  who was so taken with him  that she desired the ambassador  upon his departure  to leave Rizzio behind  The excellence of his voice soon procured him greater familiarities  the Queen loved him  confided in him  and ever kept him next her person  The new King  who now only had the name  could not  without jealousy  see this insinuating foreigner receive all the Queen s favours  while he was treated only with contempt  Stung at once with envy  rage  and resentment  he at length resolved to murder the man he could not equal  and consulted with some Lords about the method of accomplishing his cruel design  Men in power ever find accomplices in their guilt  two other Lords and he settled it  that the murder should be committed before the face of the Queen  as a punishment of her scandalous conduct  thus prepared  they were informed that Rizzio was  at that very instant  in the Queen s chamber  Lord Darnly led the way  conducting the assassins up by a private stair case  and entering the Queen s chamber  who was at table with her favourite Rizzio  Darnly stood for some time leaning   284 upon the back of her chair  His fierce looks  and unexpected intrusion  in some measure alarmed the Queen  who  however  kept silence  not daring to call out  a little after Lord Ruthven  one of the murderers  and George Douglas  entered abruptly  all in arms  and attended with more of their accomplices  The Queen could no longer refrain  but asked the reason of this bold intrusion  Ruthven made her no answer  but ordered Rizzio to quit a place of which he was unworthy  Rizzio now saw that he was the object of their vengeance  and  trembling with fear  took hold of the Queen s robe  to put himself under her protection  who  on her part  strove to interpose between the assassins and him  Douglas  in the mean time  had reached the unfortunate Rizzio  and  taking a dagger from the King s side  drew it  and  while the Queen filled the room with her cries  he plunged it  in her presence
