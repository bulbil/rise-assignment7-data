this is an effect principally founded on surprize        We are touched that a person pleases us more than she seemed at first to have a right to do  and we are agreably surprized that she should have known how to conquer those defects which our eyes shewed us  but which our hearts no longer believe   tis for this reason that women  who are not handsome  have often graces or agreablenesses  and that beautiful ones very seldom have        For a beautiful person does generally the very contrary of what we expected  she appears to us by degrees less amiable  and  after having surprized us pleasingly  she surprizes us in a contrary manner  but the agreable impression is old  the disagreable one new   tis also seldom that beauties inspire violent passions  which are almost always reserved for those who have graces  that is to say  agreablenesses  which we did not expect  and which we had no reason to expect        Magnificent habits have seldom grace  which the dresses of shepherdesses often have        We admire the majesty of the draperies of Paul Veronese  but we are touched with the simplicity of Raphael  and the exactness of Corregio        Paul Veronese promises much  and pays all he promises  Raphael and Corregio promise little  and pay much  which pleases us more        These graces  these agreablenesses  are found oftener in the mind than in the countenance  the charms of a beautiful countenance are seldom hidden  they appear at first view  but the mind does not shew itself except by degrees  when it pleases  and as much as it pleases  it can conceal itself in order to appear  and give that species of surprize to which those graces  of which I speak  owe their existence        This grace  this agreableness  is less in the countenance than in the manner  the manner changes every instant  and can therefore every moment give us the pleasure of surprize  in one word  a woman can be handsome but in one way  but she may be agreable in a hundred thousand        I like this doctrine of Montesquieu s extremely  because it gives every woman her chance  and because it ranks me above a thousand handsomer women  in the dear power of inspiring passion       Cruel creature  why did you give me the idea of flowers  I now envy you your foggy climate  the earth with you is at this moment covered with a thousand lovely children of the spring  with us  it is an universal plain of snow       Our beaux are terribly at a loss for similies  you have lilies of the valley for comparisons  we nothing but what with the idea of whiteness gives that of coldness too       This is all the quarrel I have with Canada  the summer is delicious  the winter pleasant with all its severities  but alas  the smiling spring is not here  we pass from winter to summer in an instant  and lose the sprightly season of the Loves       A letter from the God of my idolatry I must answer it instantly   Adieu  Yours   c   A  FERMOR     LETTER CXXVIII   128   To Captain FITZGERALD   YES  I give permission  you may come this afternoon  there is something amusing enough in your dear nonsense  and  as my father will be at Quebec  I shall want amusement       It will also furnish a little chat for the misses at Quebec  a tête à tête with a tall Irishman is a subject which cannot escape their sagacity       Adieu  Yours   A  F     LETTER CXXIX   129   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   Silleri  April 20   AFTER my immense letter to your love  my dear  you must not expect me to say much to your fair ladyship       I am glad to find you manage Temple so admirably  the wisest  the wildest  the gravest  and the gayest  are equally our slaves  when we have proper ideas of petticoat politics       I intend to compose a code of laws for the government of husbands  and get it translated into all the modern languages  which I apprehend will be of infinite benefit to the world       Do you know I am a greater fool than I imagined  You may remember I was always extremely fond of sweet waters  I left them off lately  upon an idea  though a mistaken one  that Fitzgerald did not like them  I yesterday heard him say the contrary  and  without thinking of it  went mechanically to my dressing room  and put lavender water on my handkerchief       This is  I am afraid  rather a strong symptom of my being absurd  however  I find it pleasant to be so  and therefore give way to it       It is divinely warm to day  though the snow is still on the ground  it is melting fast however  which makes it impossible for me to get to Quebec  I shall be confined for at least a week
