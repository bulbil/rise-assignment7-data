universal pleasure than all the rest  for observing the manner in which I had disposed my books on the table before me  he very dextrously displaced one of them  and put an obscene jest book of his own in the place  However I took no notice of all that this mischievous groupe of little beings could do  but went on  perfectly sensible that what was ridiculous in my attempt  would excite mirth only the first or second time  while what was serious would be permanent  My design succeeded  and in less than six days some were penitent  and all attentive     Page  118  It was now that I applauded my perseverance and address  at thus giving sensibility to wretches divested of every moral feeling  and now began to think of doing them temporal services also  by rendering their situation somewhat more comfortable  Their time had hitherto been divided between famine and excess  tumultous riot and bitter repining  Their only employment was quarrelling among each other  playing cribbage  and cutting tobacco stoppers  From this last mode of idle industry I took the hint of setting such as chose to work at cutting pegs for tobacconists and shoemakers  the proper wood being bought by a general subscription  and when manufactured  sold by my appointment  so that each earned something every day  a trifle indeed  but sufficient to maintain him     I did not stop here  but instituted fines or the punishment of immorality  and rewards for peculiar industry  Thus in less  Page  119  than a fortnight I had formed them into something social and humane  and had the pleasure of regarding myself as a legislator  who had brought men from their native ferocity into friendship and obedience     And it were highly to be wished  that legislative power would thus direct the law rather to reformation than severity  That it would appear convinced that the work of eradicating crimes is not by making punishments familiar  but formidable  Instead of our present prisons  which find or make men guilty  which enclose wretches for the commission of one crime  and return them  if returned alive  fitted for the perpetuation of thousands  it were to be wished we had  as in other parts of Europe  places of penitence and solitude  where the accused might be attended by such as could give them repentance if guilty  or new motives to virtue if innocent  And this  but not the increasing punishments  is the  Page  120  way to mend a state  nor can I avoid even questioning the validity of that right which social combinations have assumed of capitally punishing offences of a slight nature  In cases of murder their right is obvious  as it is the duty of us all  from the law of self defence  to cut off that man who has shewn a disregard for the life of another  Against such  all nature rises in arms  but it is not so against him who steals my property  Natural law gives me no right to take away his life  as by that the horse he steals is as much his property as mine  If then I have any right  it must be from a compact made between us  that he who deprives the other of his horse shall die  But this is a false compact  because no man has a right to barter his life  no more than to take it away  as it is not his own  And next the compact is inadequate  and would be set aside even in a court of modern equity  as there is a great penalty for a very trifling convenience  since it is far better  Page  121  that two men should live  than that one man should ride  But a compact that is false between two men  is equally so between an hundred  or an hundred thousand  for as ten millions of circles can never make a square  so the united voice of myriads cannot lend the smallest foundation to falsehood  It is thus that reason speaks  and untutored nature says the same thing  Savages that are directed nearly by natural law alone are very tender of the lives of each other  they seldom shed blood but to retaliate former cruelty     Our Saxon ancestors  fierce as they were in war  had but few executions in times of peace  and in all commencing governments that have the print of nature still strong upon them  scarce any crime is held capital     It is among the citizens of a resined community that penal laws  which are in  Page  122  the hands of the rich  are laid upon the poor  Government  while it grows older  seems to acquire the moroseness of age  and as if our possessions were become dearer in proportion as they increased  as if the more enormous our wealth  the more extensive our fears  our possessions are paled up with new edicts every day  and hung round with gibbets to scare every invader     Whether is it from the number of our penal laws  or the licentiousness of our people  that this country should shew more convicts in a year  than half the dominions of Europe united  Perhaps it is owing to both  for they mutually produce each
