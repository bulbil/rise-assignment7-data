and Mr Arnold are engaged at their game  and make them decide the contest between them  Nay  I threaten that I will  some night or other  steal to bed and leave them  for she is unconscionable at late hours  and as she lives very near us  and keeps a chariot  she does not scruple to go home at any hour of the night  What a pity it is so amiable a woman should be thus fondly attached to so unprofitable an amusement  for I begin to see play is her foible  though  to do her justice  she never engages but for very trifling sums  and that only in our own little domestic way  But this passion may grow upon her  and she may be led unawares into the losing more than her fortune can bear   August 12  I never was so disconcerted as I have been this day  you will be surprized when I tell you  it was by my good lady V——  She came to pass the day with me  Mr Arnold being engaged abroad   We were both sitting at work in the parlour  lady V—— had continued silent for a good while  at last looking at me with a most benign smile  for I had at the same instant cast my eyes at her  I was just then thinking  my dear Mrs Arnold  said she  that I once  though perhaps you did not know it  flattered myself with the hopes of being related to you  Her words threw me into confusion  though I did not know their meaning  It would have been both an honour and a happiness to me  madam  I replied  though I don’t know by what means I was ever likely to possess it  She continued smiling  but seemed in suspence whether she should proceed  You will pardon my curiosity my dear  said she  but give me leave to ask  whether Mr Arnold was not once near losing the happiness he now enjoys  I felt my face glow as she spoke  There was once a treaty of marriage on foot  madam  I answered  between me and another gentleman  I am sorry I mentioned it  said my lady  observing my confusion  but as I was no stranger to the affair while it was transacting  and Mr Faulkland is a kinsman of mine  I hope you will forgive my inquisitiveness  for I own I have a curiosity  which I believe no body but yourself can gratify  and if I did not think you the most candid  as well as the best tempered creature living  I durst not push my enquiry  My lord  you are to know  was in London  at the time Mr Faulkland was first introduced to you  and as they are extremely fond    of each other  Mr Faulkland did not scruple to disclose his passion to him  nor the success it then appeared likely to be crowned with  giving him at the same time such a character of you  as I have since found you deserve   When my lord returned to V—— hall  which he was obliged to do very soon after Mr Faulkland had made this discovery to him  he informed me of the alliance my cousin Faulkland was going to make  and we were pleasing ourselves with the thoughts of congratulating him on his happiness  when we received a letter from him that put an end to all our expectations  this letter contained but four distracted lines  he told my lord  in broken sentences  that he had lost all hopes of Miss Bidulph  that an act of indiscretion had been construed into a capital crime  and that being banished from the presence of the woman he adored  he was immediately about to bid adieu to England  perhaps for ever   This was the substance of what he wrote to us  we have heard from him since a few times  but he never cleared up the matter to us  nor even so much as mentioned it  I have not been in London since  my lord has  but he never could get any light into the mystery  he heard from some of our friends  who knew of the intended match  that it was broke off nobody knew why  There were  however  several idle surmises thrown out  some laid the blame on Mr Faulkland  and some on you  but the truth I believe still remains a secret  Now  my dear  if my curiosity is improper  or if there was any particular motive to this disappointment of my kinsman’s hopes  which you don’t chuse to reveal  forgive my enquiry  and think no more of it  but take up that book  and read to me while I work   Though my lady gave me this kind opportunity of evading her question  I did not lay hold of it  I did not indeed chuse to reveal the whole of this affair  because I did not think myself at liberty to divulge Miss Burchell’s secret  however I might discover my own  I told my lady in general terms  that though Mr Faulkland might pretend to a lady every way my superior  yet there was an objection to him of no small weight with us  that my mother had been informed of a very recent piece of gallantry
