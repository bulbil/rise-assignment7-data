send   some excuse to your brother  and let us have you with us         Unhand me  my lord   cried she  struggling to get loose   what you ask   is impossible  for I neither can nor will go   The resolution with which   she spoke these words  and the anger which at the same time sparkled in   her eyes  made them see it would be but lost labour to endeavour to   persuade her  they looked one at another  and were confounded what to   do  till Miss Airish  vexed to the very heart at Miss Betsy s behaviour    hit upon an expedient to solve the matter   Well   said she   since Miss   Betsy cannot go  I will introduce your lordship to a young lady  who  I   am sure  will not refuse us  besides  I know she is at home  for I saw   her looking out of her chamber window as we came by  but we must go   directly  that she may have time to dress        On this they both cried  with all their hearts  and one of them  taking   her hand  skipped down stairs with her in the same wild way they came   up  the other followed  only turning his head towards Miss Betsy  crying   with a malicious sneer             How unregarded now that piece of beauty stands        Miss Betsy  though sufficiently piqued  was very glad to get rid of   them  and the more so  that by their happening to call on her  instead   of her meeting them at Miss Airish s apartment  she had the better   opportunity of excusing herself from going where they desired                CHAPTER XV       The terrible consequence which may possibly attend our placing too   great a dependance on persons whose principles we are not well assured   of  are here exemplified in a notable act of villainy and hypocrisy          Miss Betsy no sooner found herself alone  than she began to reflect very   seriously on the preceding passage  she knew very little of these two   young noblemen  yet thought she saw enough in their behaviour to make   any woman  who had the least regard for her honour or reputation    fearful to trust herself with them in any place where both might be so   much endangered  she was  therefore  very much amazed that Miss Airish   should run so great a risque  and  to find that she did so  joined to   some other things which she had of late observed in the conduct of both   the sisters  contributed to diminish the love and esteem she once had   for them       She found  however  too many objects of satisfaction in the visits she   made to those ladies to be willing to break acquaintance with them  and    as she doubted not but that she had highly disobliged the one  by not   complying with her invitation  and that this would infallibly occasion a   rupture with the other also  if not in time reconciled  she went the   next morning to their apartment  in order to make her peace       On her enquiring for that lady  the footman told her she was but just   come home  and  he believed  was going to bed  but he would tell the   chamber maid she was there   No  no   cried Miss Betsy   only give my   compliments to your lady  and tell her I will wait on her this   afternoon   She was going away with these words  but Miss Airish  lying   on the same floor  heard her voice  and called to her to come in       Miss Betsy did as she was desired  and found her in a much better   humour than she expected   O  my dear   said she   what a night have you   lost by not being with us  Such a promiscuous enjoyment of every thing   that can afford delight or satisfaction   Well  after all  there is   nothing like playing the rake a little sometimes  it gives such a   fill up to the spirits         Provided it be innocent  I am of your mind   replied Miss Betsy   I   suppose every thing was managed with decency among you     O quite so     cried the other   all harmless libertinism  it is true  there were   private rooms  but  you know  one might chuse whether one would go into   them or not     I am not sure of that
