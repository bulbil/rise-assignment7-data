HISTOEY OF A GENERAL AUSIONBB â€” HIS METHOD   OF MAKING CHAKITY BEGIN AT HOME â€” HE CONVBBTS A NOTED   BAWD  BUT DISAPPOINTS HIS DESIGNS BY TOO GBEAT CONFIDENCE   IN HIS OWN SKILL â€” THE CHAEAOTEB OF A CLEBGYMAN     Move your eye to the left  and view that demure looking picture   of devotion  who sits there in silence  lifting up his eyes to Heaven    and sighing in spirit  at the festivity and sensual conversation round   him      Who  that can see no deeper than outward appearances  would   not think that man sincere in his professions of religion and virtue     whereas  in truth  he is the most abandoned contemner of both    and deepens the dye of his blackest crimes by the most hardened   hypocrisy  secretly living on the practice of those very vices  of   which he professes the greatest abhorrence      With all that consequence  which he assumes in the direction   of this charity  on the merit of the largeness of his subscription to   it  in reality  he is but the dispenser of other people s benefactions    into whose good opinion he so insinuates himself  by his pretended   piety  that they entrust their charity to his disposal  who always   pays himself for his trouble  by subducting largely from the sums   confided to him  For  as real charity vaunteth not itself  they   never divulge the secret  completely imposed on by his address    that never lets one half of his contributors know of the other   by   which management  as the sums he gives are always made public    for example and imitation  each thinks that he adds most liberally   to his own donation  But this is not the only method by which   he turns his piety to advantage  The access which the reputation   of it gains him in almost every family  opens to him an opportunity   of carrying on the deepest intrigues  and becoming a pander for   vices both natural and unnatural  which the interest of the parties   concerned makes them still keep secret  As for the former  the   m ystery of that trade has been in part explained already  and the   latter is too horrible for explanation  I shall  therefore  pass over   those scenes  and conclude my account of this extraordinary   personage  with one instance of his address  in finding out and   managing the weak side of superstition and vice      In the course of his love negotiations  ho had made an acquaint    ance with a woman who kept a public bagnio  or house of prostitution    which acquaintance mutual interest cemented into an intimacy          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 101     In this most infamous trade had this woman amassed considerable   wealth  the disposal of which  after her death  took up much of her   thoughts  in those moments when the consequences of her debauched   life forced her to think of djong      As the secrets of their trade had removed every reserve from   between them  she often used to consult him upon this head   when   he always comforted her with dissertations upon religion and virtue    stripping them of the vain incumbrances of priestcraft  and bringing   them back to their genuine principles of benevolence and charity      Frequent inculcations of this doctrine had the efiect he designed     the matron was pleased with the thought of having all the benefit   of religion  without the trouble of the practice  and immediately   began to exercise her donations to public charities  which  as it   was not quite so much in character for her to offer in person  while   she continued her profession  and she saw no necessity  nor felt   inclination to quit that  she always confided to the distribution of   her spiritual guide      Nor did his success stop here   he improved his influence on her   superstition so far  that he prevailed on her to compound with   Heaven for the vices of her life by bequeathing the earnings of   them to its use  after her death      For this purpose he himself drew her will  which pious application   of her fortune set her conscience at ease   and she continued her   usual business to the hour of her death  which happened three years   after  with such care and industry  that some instance of negligence   in one of her servants administering to the pleasure of her guests      gave her such uneasiness in her last moments  that  with her dying   breath  she lamented the ruin her house must come to  after she   should quit the care of it  for the joys of heaven      You must not think that his
