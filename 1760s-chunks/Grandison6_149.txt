L  what   371 an admirable man is your brother  What a happy creature is my Harriet   When Divine Service was over  I was afraid our Procession  as I may call it  would have been interrupted by the compliments of some of the gentry of our acquaintance  whose opened pew doors shewed their readiness to address them  But all passed in silent respects from Gentlemen and Ladie  My cousin  when she came home  rejoiced that one of her parading times was over  But when  my dearest Love  said Sir Charles  will the time be past  that all who see you will admire you   The Church in the afternoon was still more crouded than before  How were Sir Charles and my uncle blessed by the poor  and people of low degree  for their well dispensed bounty to them   My cousin has delighted Mrs  Shirly  by telling her  that Sir Charles had said there would be a Rite wanting  till he and she had communicated  according to the order of the Church  at the Altar  on this particular occasion   Just now is every thing settled that Sir Charles wished to be settled  Lady G  will acquaint you with particulars  I doubt not   Permit me to commend myself to your Ladyship s favours  as one of the  Humblest and sincerest of your Servants  LUCY SELBY   P  S  Lady G  has half broke my heart   On perusal of what I have written  she says  I have not done my best  I have not given half particulars enough —In short  she finds a multitude of faults with me—Even calls me names  Sorry girl  lazy  and I can t tell what   But do you  madam  acquit me  and I shall be easy     372 I told her  that I thought I had been very minute   What  to a lying in woman  she says  who has no variety before her  All one dull chamberscene  hourly acted over again—The subject so rich   I answered  It should then have had the richest pen —Why did she not write herself  If it was not for laziness sake  it was for self sake  that she did not  As I knew Lady L  would have been a gainer by the change of pen  I had much rather have been in the company for which she quitted the task  than grubbing pens in my closet  and all to get nothing but discommendation   I have shewn her this my Postcript  She raves  But I am hardened  She will soon have an oppertunity to supply all my defects  in person   END of VOL  VI
