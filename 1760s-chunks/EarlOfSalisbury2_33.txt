anguish  bounded  furiously from the ground where he had fixed his knee  and loudly  demanding the vile murderer of his peace  issued forth in search of  Raymond   By this time the castle was in confusion  Chauvigny and his few  attendants had been prevented  by superior numbers  from following Earl  William  They expressed their surprize  and now began too late to  perceive their danger  One of them  suddenly taking a horn from his  side  prepared to give so shrill a blast  as would have reached the ears  of their companions  and quickened their speed  but Grey  who now had  the sole command  as suddenly prevented him  by declaring with a stern  insolence  that the least alarm should prove immediate death to Lord  William  His design  which he now sought to execute  was  to raise a violent broil and tumult in the castle  and to assassinate  the Earl  in the confusion  —The presence and interposition of Raymond  he deemed necessary  and he hastened to summon this Lord  to embrace the  fair occasion of destroying his rival  which fortune presented to him   At first entering the apartment  his eyes were wounded by an object of  terror  which at once confounded all his designs  Raymond had fallen  upon his sword  Grey started back in amazement  and  in that moment   William entered and saw the unhappy Lord  pale and bleeding on the  ground  who shut his languid eyes  as if ashamed to meet the  countenance of him he had wronged  The art  the hypocrisy  the boldness  and recollection of Grey  all deserted him  He stood trembling and  confounded  awed by the presence of the Earl  as by that of a superior  being  At length he attempted to retire  but William  drawing his  sword  forbad him with a terrible authority  and demanded the meaning of  what he now beheld  Raymond  lifting his eyes faintly  just found  breath  at broken and painful intervals  to declare  that his own hand  had done it —        I have indeed wronged thee  Lord  nor could I endure thy triumph  and my  own shame  yes  I have destroyed the noblest Lady —But there stands the  accursed wretch  the false and traiterous        —Here his emotion grew too violent for his languid condition  He was  seized with a sudden pang  he groaned and expired   The Earl then  turning to Grey  exclaimed        Yes  Thou art the wretch who laboured to aggravate the distresses of  Ela  with such infernal diligence  Thou art he who basely stole away my  son         — Grey fell upon his knees  supplicating for mercy with the most abject  and servile fear  and promising to restore young William  The Earl  raised his arm  and prepared to strike the miscreant    Kill me not    cried Grey       or thy son is for ever lost  I alone know the secret of his present  residence         Here a sudden and violent shout arrested the sword of William  His  followers had arrived  had quickly forced the  gates open  and rushed in a rapid torrent  through the halls  Les Roches  and Chauvigny  Randolph and Oswald  directed by the out cries of Grey   and the loud rage of Salisbury  forced in  just as the wicked agent of  oppression was entreating for mercy  At sight of Oswald  despair  pierced his soul heart  and when he espied young William led on and  protected from the violence of the rout  he closed his eyes  and  crouched to receive the deadly blow   O shame to manhood   cried  Randolph       shall such a slave die by the arm of William —Look there  noble Lord    pointing from the window to the body of Reginhald  which still hung  from the oak  behold  thy just vengeance is prevented  Behold the  punishment which befits such vileness          Be it so   cried William       well dost thou instruct me         And  without farther respite  was Grey led forth to share the fate of  his wicked brother   The view of blood and death allayed the joy of William and his noble  friends  The good old Knight was moved  and now seemed to regret that  the just punishment of Grey  had not been inflicted but by abfolute and  violent power  All the late dismal effects of lawless oppression crouded  into his mind  and he felt the want of that inestimable blessing  a  wise  righteous  and well attempered rule     The thoughts of Ela  and her unhappy condition  still diffused a gloom  over the countenance of the Earl  His thanks and congratulations were  grave and solemn  The body of Raymond
