war   said the cynic   may soon be brought to a conclusion  and your adventures close in Bridewell  provided you meet with some determined constable  who will seize your worship as a vagrant  according to the statute    Heaven and earth   cried the stranger  starting up  and laying his hand on his sword   do I live to hear myself insulted with such an opprobrious epithet  and refrain from trampling into dust the insolent calumniator    The tone in which these words were pronounced  and the indignation that flashed from the eyes of the speaker  intimidated every individual of the society  and reduced Ferret to a temporary privation of all his faculties  His eyes retired within their sockets  his complexion  which was naturally of a copper hue  now shifted to a leaden colour  his teeth began to chatter  and all his limbs were agitated by a sudden palsy  The knight observed his condition  and resumed his seat  saying   I was to blame  my vengeance must be reserved for very different objects  Friend  you have nothing to fear—the sudden gust of passion is now blown over  Recollect yourself  and I will reason calmly on the observation you have made    This was a very seasonable declaration to Mr  Ferret  who opened his eyes  and wiped his forehead  while the other proceeded in these terms   You say I am in danger of being apprehended as a vagrant  I am not so ignorant of the laws of my country  but that I know the description of those who fall within the legal meaning of this odious term  You must give me leave to inform you  friend  that I am neither bearward  fencer  stroller  gipsy  mountebank  nor mendicant  nor do I practise subtle craft  to deceive and impose upon the king s lieges  nor can I be held as an idle disorderly person  travelling from place to place  collecting monies by virtue of counterfeited passes  briefs  and other false pretences  in what respect  therefore  am I to be deemed a vagrant  Answer boldly without fear or scruple    To this interrogation the misanthrope replied  with a faltering accent   If not a vagrant  you incur the penalty for riding armed in affray of the peace    But  instead of riding armed in affray of the peace   resumed the other   I ride in preservation of the peace  and gentlemen are allowed by the law to wear armour for their defence  Some ride with blunderbusses  some with pistols  some with swords  according to their various inclinations  Mine is to wear the armour of my forefathers  Perhaps I use them for exercise  in order to accustom myself to fatigue  and strengthen my constitution  perhaps I assume them for a frolic     But if you swagger  armed and in disguise  assault me on the highway  or put me in bodily fear for the sake of the jest  the law will punish you in earnest   cried the other   But my intention   answered the knight   is carefully to avoid all those occasions of offence    Then   said Ferret   you may go unarmed  like other sober people    Not so   answered the knight   as I propose to travel all times  and in all places  mine armour may guard me against the attempts of treachery  it may defend me in combat against odds  should I be assaulted by a multitude  or have occasion to bring malefactors to justice     What  then   exclaimed the philosopher   you intend to co operate with the honourable fraternity of thief takers    I do purpose   said the youth  eyeing him with a look of ineffable contempt   to act as a coadjutator to the law  and even to remedy evils which the law cannot reach  to detect fraud and treason  abase insolence  mortify pride  discourage slander  disgrace immodesty  and stigmatise ingratitude  but the infamous part of a thief catcher s character I disclaim  I neither associate with robbers and pickpockets  knowing them to be such  that  in being intrusted with their secrets  I may the more effectually betray them  nor shall I ever pocket the reward granted by the legislature to those by whom robbers are brought to conviction  but I shall always think it my duty to rid my country of that pernicious vermin  which prey upon the bowels of the commonwealth—not but that an incorporated company of licensed thieves might  under proper regulations  be of service to the community    Ferret  emboldened by the passive tameness with which the stranger bore his last reflection  began to think he had nothing of Hector but his outside  and gave a loose to all the acrimony of his party rancour  Hearing the knight mention a company of licensed thieves   What else   cried he   is the majority of the nation  What is your standing army at home  that eat up their fellow subjects  What are your mercenaries abroad  whom you hire to fight their own quarrels  What is your militia  that wise measure of a sagacious ministry  but
