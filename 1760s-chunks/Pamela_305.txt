so excellent  that it gives a moral certainty it   never can       Sir  said Mr  Brooks to my dear master  softly  You have a most   accomplished lady  I do assure you  as well in her behaviour and wit    as in her person  call her what you please  Why  my dear friend  said my   master  I must tell you  as I have said before now  that her person made   me her lover  but her mind made her my wife       The first course coming in  my dear sir led me himself to my place  and   set Mr  Chambers  as the greatest stranger  at my right hand  and Mr    Brooks at my left  and Mr  Arthur was pleased to observe  much to my   advantage  on the ease and freedom with which I behaved myself  and   helped them  and said  he would bring his lady to be a witness  and a   learner both  of my manners  I said  I should be proud of any honour   Mrs  Arthur would vouchsafe to do me  and if once I could promise myself   the opportunity of his good lady s example  and those of the other   gentlemen present  I should have the greater opinion of my worthiness to   sit in the place I filled at present with much insufficiency       Mr  Arthur drank to my health and happiness  and said  My wife told your   spouse  madam  you had very good luck in such a husband  but I now   see who has the best of it  Said Mr  Brooks  Come  come  let s make no   compliments  for the plain truth of the matter is  our good neighbour s   generosity and judgment have met with so equal a match in his lady s   beauty and merit  that I know not which has the best luck  But may you   be both long happy together  say I  And so he drank a glass of wine       My best friend  who always takes delight to have me praised  seemed much   pleased with our conversation  and he said the kindest  tenderest  and   most respectful things in the world to me  Insomuch  that the rough   Mr  Martin said  Did you ever think our good friend here  who used to   ridicule matrimony so much  would have made so complaisant a husband    How long do you intend  sir  that this shall hold  As long as my good   girl deserves it  said he  and that  I hope  will be for ever  But    continued the kind gentleman  you need not wonder I have changed my mind   as to wedlock  for I never expected to meet with one whose behaviour and   sweetness of temper were so well adapted to make me happy       After dinner  and having drank good healths to each of their ladies  I   withdrew  and they sat and drank two bottles of claret a piece  and were   very merry  and went away  full of my praises  and vowing to bring their   ladies to see me          John having brought me your kind letter  my dear father  I told my good   master  after his friends were gone  how gratefully you received his   generous intentions as to the Kentish farm  and promised your best   endeavours to serve him in that estate  and that you hoped your industry   and care would be so well employed in it  that you should be very little   troublesome to him   as to the liberal manner in which he had intended   to add to a provision  that of itself exceeded all you wished  He was   very well pleased with your cheerful acceptance of it       I am glad your engagements in the world lie in so small a compass  As   soon as you have gotten an account of them exactly  you will be pleased   to send it me  with the list of the poor folks you are so kind to   promise to procure me       I think  as my dear master is so generous  you should account nothing   that is plain  too good  Pray don t be afraid of laying out upon   yourselves  My dear sir intends that you shall not  when you come to us    return to your old abode  but stay with us  till you set out for Kent    and so you must dispose of yourselves accordingly  And I hope  my dear   father  you have quite left off all slavish business  As farmer Jones   has been kind to you  as I have heard you say  pray  when you take leave   of them  present them
