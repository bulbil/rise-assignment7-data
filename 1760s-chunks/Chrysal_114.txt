   pearance  their surprise was changed the other way   they all re    membered his entrance  but every one of them positively insisted   that he had not gone back   so that the question now was  what   could have possibly become of him   as his leaping out of the window    as the others had gallantly done  was neither necessary  nor indeed   possible for him to do  maimed as he was      While they were forming sagacious conjectures on so strange   and unaccountable an affair  the metamorphosed constable  who   had joined in the conversation  said to an old lady  who seemed   more strongly affected than any other of the company  that the   oddness of this affair put him in mind of one  not very unlike it in   many circumstances  which he had read in accounts of good authority   to have happened in IVance during the minority of Louis XTV      This raised the curiosity of all who heard him  who immediately   crowded round him  and desired him to tell it  At first he seemed   rather unwilling  and very gravely prefaced his story with declaring    that for his part he believed nothing of the matter  though he owned   it was related by writers of undoubted veracity  and attested in   a manner almost beyond any fact he had ever read in history    Having thus prepared them for something extraordinary  he pro    ceeded thus     You know  madam    addressing himself to the old   lady  to whom he had first mentioned it  and who he knew plumed   herself not a little upon her knowledge in secret history  everything   that bore the name of which she had read  and implicitly believed   every word of     that  in the minority of Louis the Great  Mazarine    who governed the kingdom  took every method of diverting the   attention of the young monarch from state affairs  by all kinds   of pleasurable entertainment that could be devised          True  sir    answered the old lady  who could not restrain her   desire of showing her knowledge     and that is said to have influ    enced the conduct of his future life  in that expensive pomp and   vain magnificence  which attracted the admiration of foreigners    while it exhausted and ruined his subjects    Hem   hem   but   I beg pardon  sir  pray don t let me interrupt you          As this Mazarine was an Italian  you know  madam    continued   he  to which she assented with a nod  as she constantly did    it   wag natural for him to have a fondness for the entertainments of   his own country  he therefore introduced the Italian opera mto   Trance  The first time it was presented  one of the principal parts   of the entertainment consisted of a comic dance that was performed   by six of the nimblest caperers in all Italy  At first they went   on expertly  and with great applause   but immediately found   themselves at a loss  and were unable to proceed any further  being   put out by the intrusion of a strange dancer  who came among   them nobody could tell how  and disconcerted the entire scheme of   their dance  which had been calculated only for their own number          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 117     This at length threw them into such confusion  that they were   obliged to stand still   when the manager of the entertainment   coming to them to see what was the matter  perceived the cause   of their confusion  and obliged them all to unmask  for they were   dressed exactly alike and wore masks  that he might detect and   seize the impertinent intruder  when  to his  and to the utter as    tonishment of every one present  he vanished as unaccountably   as he had come  though the eyes of the whole house were upon him    and there appeared to be no more than the original number  and   the same persons who began the dance  I believe  madam  you   may recollect the other circumstances of the story  which I do not   choose to mention on this occasion   they are told in the secret   memoirs of Cardinal Mazarine          I do  sir    returned she  with great emotion    remember some    thing of it  But really         Dear madam    interrupted another  whose curiosity was raised   too high to bear a moment s delay    pray let the gentleman pro
