  mansion with your presence  perhaps a rival  oh  forbid it Heaven         forbid it  all ye stars that  under the Supreme  rule all beneath        the moon  The thought is terrible  and shocks the inmost cavities        of my adoring jealous soul  I kneel while I am writing  and implore        you to grant me permission to sip a cup of nectar and ambrosia at        your tea table this afternoon  and if you can  without injustice to        superior merit  debar all other intruders thence  that I may have        liberty to pour forth my ejaculations at your feet  I am  with the        most ardent devotion  brightest refulgency of beauty  your most        adoring  and everlasting slave            F  FINEER        As little as Mr  Francis at this time was disposed to mirth  he could   not  in spite of his ill humour  refrain laughing on reading some   expressions in this heroically learned epistle   I need not ask   said   he  throwing the letter contemptuously on the table   who  or what  this   new adorer of yours is  it is easy to see he is either mad or a fool  or   thinks to make you so         I have as bad an opinion of his intellects as you have   replied she     but I assure you he is a baronet  and the presumptive heir of a much   greater title  and has an estate large enough to keep me a coach and   twelve  if the custom of the country permitted        Mr  Francis paused for a few moments  and  after looking over the letter   again   I wish   said he   instead of a fool of fashion  he is not a   knave in the disguise of a coxcomb  his stupidity seems to me to be too   egregious to be natural  all his expressions have more the appearance of   a studied affectation  than of a real folly  Take care  sister  I have   heard there are many impostors in this town  who are continually on the   watch for young ladies who have lost their parents  and live in the   unguarded manner you do        Miss Betsy seemed to treat her brother s suspicions on this head with a   good deal of contempt  she told him  that the person at whose house she   became acquainted with Sir Frederick  knew his circumstances perfectly   well  that he had a prodigious estate  was of a very ancient and   honourable family  and conversed with several people of the first   quality in England   However   added she   you may call here this   afternoon  and see him yourself  if you please  for  according to my   judgment  he has not wit enough to be an impostor        Mr  Francis replied  that he would be glad to see so extraordinary a   person if he were not obliged to go upon some business relating to the   commission he was soliciting  which he feared would detain him beyond   the hour   But  with your leave   said he   I will take this letter with   me  and hear what my brother thinks of it        To this Miss Betsy readily agreed  and he went away in somewhat of a   better humour than he had entered  or that he had put her into by the   severe reprimands he had given her       She had a very tender regard for her brothers  but did not think it   their province to prescribe rules for her behaviour  she looked upon   herself as a better judge in what manner it would become her to act    than they could possibly be  as having lived more years in London than   either of them had done months  and  if she was willing to be advised    would not submit to be directed by them       Thus did her pride a while support her spirits  but when she reflected   on the affair of Mr  Trueworth  and the reasons she had given him for   speaking and thinking of her in that cool manner she found he now did    she began to be somewhat less tenacious  and acknowledged within   herself  that her brother Frank  exclusive of his friendship for that   gentleman  had sufficient cause to blame her conduct in that point  and   the heat of passion which had been raised by some expressions he had
