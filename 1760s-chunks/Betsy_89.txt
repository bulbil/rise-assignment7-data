reader will probably think as Miss Betsy did  but the falsity of   this conjecture  and the cruel return the good nature of that young lady   met with  will in due time and place appear                CHAPTER II       Contains some passages which  perhaps  may be looked upon as pretty   extraordinary          According to the common rule of honour among gentlemen  Mr  Trueworth   had certainly behaved so  as not to have either that  or his good   nature  called in question  but this was not enough to satisfy him  he   could not be easy under the reflection  that the obligations he had   conferred gave a painful gratitude to the receiver       He was deeply affected with Mr  Staple s letter  he doubted not but that   gentleman  in forcing himself to resign his pretensions to Miss Betsy    must suffer the extremest agonies  and heartily commiserating a case    which  had fortune so decreed  might have been his own  immediately   wrote to him in the following terms             To T  Staple  Esq            Sir            I am ashamed to find the little I have done so much over rated by a        person  who  I am certain  is capable of the greatest things  but        should be involved in more confusion still  should any        consideration of me  or my happiness  prevail on you to become an        enemy to your own  I am altogether unacquainted with what kind of        sentiments either of us is regarded by the fair object of our        mutual wishes  It is highly probable her young heart may  as yet         be quite insensible of those we have endeavoured to inspire it        with  for my own part  as I have yet no reason to despair  so I        have had also but little room for hope  You  Sir  have an equal        chance  for any thing I know  or can boast of to the contrary  and         as you saw I refused to hazard my pretensions on the point of the        sword  neither justice nor honour requires you should forfeit        yours  though an accident gave me the advantage of you in the        field  It is by Miss Betsy herself our fate is to be judged  It is        yet a moot point whether either of us will succeed in the attempt        of pleasing her  We may  perhaps  contend for an airy expectation         while another  more fortunate  shall bear away the prize from both         but if one of us is decreed to be the happy man  on which soever        the lot shall fall  he ought not to incur the hatred of the other            I gladly embrace the offer of your friendship  and whatever is the        fortune of our love  should in that  as in all other events         endeavour to prove  that I am  with an equal sincerity  Sir  your        very much obliged  and most humble servant            C  TRUEWORTH        Mr  Staple read this letter many times over  but received not all the   satisfaction which the author intended it should give him  although he   acknowledged the generosity of his rival  yet he could not conceive   there was a possibility for a man in love to be easy under the addresses   of another  without knowing himself secure of not being prejudiced by   them  He therefore concluded  that Mr  Chatfree was right in his   conjecture  and that Miss Betsy only waited for her brother s coming to   town  to declare in favour of Mr  Trueworth       This gentleman had a great share of spirit  and some pride  and these   making him disdain to pursue a fruitless aim  and suffering himself to   be publickly overcome by Mr  Trueworth in love  as he had been in fight    very much contributed to enable him to keep that resolution he had   formed in the presence of Mr  Goodman
