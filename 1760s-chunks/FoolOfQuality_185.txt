am very proud  I assure you  to have so   much credit with you   but  Mr  Harry  how comes it to pass that   we have so little of your company  Your father s business    madam  deprives me of the pleasure I should otherwise have in   attending you  Again  sir  I am quite proud that it is your atten    tion to my father alone  which prevents your having any attention   for his daughter   so saying  she vanished      Immediately I was struck with a glimpse of some uncommon   meaning in the words and behaviour of Miss Golding   but as I   never had looked toward the way of her affections  I passed it   lightly over  as some matter of whim or caprice in her sex      Among the brilliant concourse of suitors that frequented our   house  there was one Mr  Spelling  a young gentleman  highly   accomplished in his person and manners  and of a most amiable   countenance and disposition  His father  like Miss Golding s  had   been a merchant  and like him  too  had amassed an excessive   fortune  As he was modest  as I may say  to a degree of shame    facedness  he did not declare himself a lover till nearly the whole   multitude of competitors had been discarded   then  with a blush    ing diffidence  he avowed his passion to Mr  Golding  and earnestly   besought his consent and intercession in his favour  You have not   only my consent  replied the good old man  you have also my best   wishes  and shall have my best endeavours for your success  How    ever  I must warn you at the same time  Mr  Spelling  that I will   not do any violence to the inclinations of my child  although there   are not two in the world whom I would prefer to you      I was writing in my closet when Mr  Golding came in  with an   anxious importance in his countenance  and told me what passed         186 TEE FOOL OF QUALITY      between him and Mr  Spelling  and asked if I did not approve the   match  1 do not know  sir  said I  that man in England who is so   deserving of your daughter as Mr  Spelling  Then  my dear Harry    I have a commission to give you  Matilda has a great respect for   your judgment   I beseech you to make use of your influence with   her  and to exert all your oratory in behalf of this young man    But  sir  will not Miss Matilda look on this as a matter of high   presumption in one who has no manner of right to advise  No   matter   you may tell her that you did it by my desire  and that we   are both of a mind with regard to this business  Well  sir  said   I  since you are bent upon it  I will obey you   but it is the first   time that ever I obeyed you with reluctance      Soon after Mr  Golding left me his daughter entered  with a   countenance visibly unquiet and confused  My papa  sir  said she    informs me that you have a business of consequence to impart to   me  I hope  madam pray  be seated a moment  Indeed  my dear   Miss Golding  this office was not of my choosing   and I hope  I   say  you will be so good as to pardon my presumption  in consider    ation of my acting by your father s command  You alarm me  Mr    Clinton   pray  proceed  Mr  Spelling  madam  at length has had   the assurance to declare his passion for you  Your father highly   approves of Mr  Spelling for a son in law   and indeed  miss  might   I dare to speak my judgment  I know not where you could choose   to better advantage  If that is the case  Mr  Harry  I wish that I   also could be of the same opinion  And are you not  madam    what objection can you form  what exception can you have  to my   friend Spelling  A very simple one  sir  and no better than this    that he is not the man who can make me happy  I am sorry for it    my dear Miss Golding  I am truly sorry for it   were I to pick from   mankind  were I to choose throughout the world  if any one can   deserve you it is surely this same Spelling  And yet  Mr  Harry    I remember
