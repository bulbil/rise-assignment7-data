of   so amiable a companion  could not forbear applauding her resolution in   this point  but Sir Bazil would fain have been a little pleasant on the   occasion  if the grave looks of Mrs  Munden had not put his raillery to   silence  Perceiving the day was near shut in  she rose to take her   leave  it was in vain that they used all imaginable arguments to   persuade her to stay supper  she told them  that as the coach went out   so early  it was necessary for her to take some repose before she   entered upon the fatigue of her journey  Lady Loveit on this allowed the   justice of her plea  and said no more       The parting of these ladies was very moving  they embraced again and   again  promised to write frequently to each other  and mingled tears as   they exchanged farewels  Sir Bazil  who had really a very high esteem   for her  was greatly affected  in spite of the gaiety of his temper  on   bidding her adieu  and happy was it for Mrs  Munden that the concern   they were both in hindered them from perceiving that confusion  that   distraction of mind  which neither she nor Mr  Trueworth were able to   restrain totally the marks of as he approached to make her those   compliments  which might have been expected on such an occasion  even   from a person the most indifferent  his tongue  indeed  uttered no more   than words of course  but his lips trembled while saluting her  nor   could she in that instant withhold a sigh  which seemed to rend her very   heart  their mutual agitations were  in fine  too great not to be   visible to each other  and left neither of them any room to doubt of the   extreme force of the passion from which they sprang       The motive which had made her refuse staying supper at Sir Bazil s  was   to prevent Mr  Trueworth from having any pretence to wait upon her home    not being able to answer how far she could support her character  if   exposed to the tender things he might possibly address her with on such   an opportunity  and she now found  by what she had felt on parting with   him  how necessary the precaution was that she had taken       After a night less engrossed by sleep than meditation  she set out for   L    e  where she arrived without any ill accident to retard her journey    and was received by Sir Ralph and Lady Trusty with all those   demonstrations of joy  which she had reason to expect from the   experienced friendship of those worthy persons       As this was the place of her nativity  and her father had always lived   there in very great estimation  the house of Lady Trusty at first was   thronged with persons of almost all conditions  who came to pay their   compliments to her fair guest  and as no circumstance  no habit  could   take from her those charms which nature had bestowed upon her  her   beauty and amiable qualities soon became the theme of conversation   through the whole country       She was not insensible of the admiration she attracted  but was now far   from being elated with it  all the satisfaction she took out of her dear   Lady Trusty s company was in reading some instructive or entertaining   book  and in the letters of those whom she knew to be her sincere   friends  but she had not been much above two months in the country   before she received one from a quarter whence she had not expected it    It was from Mr  Trueworth  and contained as follows             To Mrs  Munden            Madam            I have the inexpressible pleasure to hear that you are well by        those whom you favour with your correspondence  but  as they may        not think any mention of me might be agreeable to you  I take the        liberty myself to acquaint you that I live  and flatter myself that        information is sufficient to make you know that I live only to be         with the most firm attachment  Madam  your eternally devoted        servant            C  TRUEWORTH        These few lines assuring her of his love  and at the same time of his   respect  by his not presuming once to mention the passion of which he   was possessed  charmed her to a very high degree
