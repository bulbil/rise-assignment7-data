every word that fell from her was to him  said a   thousand obliging things on his account  particularly  one day  after   they had been singing a two part song together   How often   cried she   to her sister   shall we wish for this gentleman  when we get into the   country  to act the principal part in our little operas        All this he returned in no other manner than any man would have done who   had no farther aim than to shew his wit and gallantry  so much of his   happiness  indeed  depended upon the event  that it behoved him to be   very cautious how he proceeded  and it is likely he would not have   ventured to throw off the mask of indifference so soon as he did  if he   had not been emboldened to it by an unexpected accident       Among the number of those who visited the sisters of Sir Bazil  there   was a young lady called Mrs  Blanchfield  she was born in the same town   with them  but had been some time in London  on account of the death of   an uncle  who had left her a large fortune  she had a great deal of   vivacity and good humour  which rendered both her person and   conversation very agreeable  she passed in the eyes of most people for a   beauty  but her charms were little taken notice of by Mr  Trueworth    though she behaved towards him in a manner which would have been   flattering enough to a man of more vanity  or who had been less   engrossed by the perfections of another       By what odd means does fortune sometimes bring about those things she is   determined to accomplish  Who could have thought this lady  with whom   Mr  Trueworth had no manner of concern  and but a slight acquaintance    should even  unknowing it herself  become the happy instrument of having   that done for him which he knew not very well how to contrive for   himself  yet so it proved  in effect  as the reader will presently   perceive       Happening to call one morning on Sir Bazil while he was dressing  O   Trueworth   said he   I am glad you have prevented me  for I was just   going to your lodgings  I have something to acquaint you with  which I   fancy you will think deserves your attention     I suppose   replied Mr    Trueworth   you would not tell me any thing that was not really so  but    pray  what is it         What  you have made a conquest here  it seems   resumed Sir Bazil   and   may say  with Caesar   Veni  vidi  vici   Did your guardian angel  or no   kind tattling star  give you notice of your approaching happiness  that   you might receive the blessing with moderation   Mr  Trueworth  not able   to conceive what it was he meant  but imagining there was some mystery   contained in this raillery  desired him to explain   For   said he   the   happiness you promise cannot come too soon         You will think so   replied Sir Bazil   when I tell you a fine lady  a   celebrated toast  and a fortune of twenty thousand pounds in her own   hands  is fallen in love with you     With me   cried Mr  Trueworth     you are merry this morning  Sir Bazil     No  faith  I am serious     resumed the other   the lady I speak of is Mrs  Blanchfield  I have   heard her say abundance of handsome things of you myself  such as  that   you were a very fine gentleman  that you had a great deal of wit  and   sung well  but my sisters tell me  that when she is alone with them  she   asks a thousand questions about you  and  in fine  talks of nothing   else  so that  according to this account  a very little courtship would   serve to make you master both of her person and fortune  What say you         That I am neither vain enough to believe   answered Mr  Trueworth   nor   ambitious enough to desire  such a thing should be real     How   cried   Sir Bazil  in some surprize   why  she is reckoned one of the finest   women in town  has wit  good nature  is of a good family  and an   unblemished reputation  Then  her fortune  Though I know your estate   sets you above wanting a fortune
