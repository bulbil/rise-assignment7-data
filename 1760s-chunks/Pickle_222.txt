 should he deny  my request  on pretence of staying for the consent of my mother s  relations  which was very uncertain  I would seize the first opportunity  of marrying Lord W    cost what it would  He consented to the match   but would not appoint a day for the ceremony  which he proposed to defer  until all parties should be agreed  and such a favourable crisis  I  feared  would never happen    I therefore resolved within myself to gratify my lover s expectation   by eloping  if possible  that very night  though the execution of this  plan was extremely difficult  because my father was upon the alarm   and my own maid  who was my bedfellow  altogether in his interest   Notwithstanding these considerations  I found means to engage one of  the housemaids in my behalf  who bespoke a hackney coach  to be kept in  waiting all night  and to bed I went with my Abigail  whom  as I had not  closed an eye  I waked about five in the morning  and sent to pack up  some things for our intended journey    While she was thus employed  I got up  and huddled on my clothes   standing upon my pillow  lest my father  who lay in the chamber below   should hear me afoot  and suspect my design  Having dressed myself with  great despatch and disorder  I flounced downstairs  stalking as heavily  as I could tread  that he might mistake me for one of the servants  and  my confederate opening the door  I sallied out into the street  though  I knew not which way to turn  and  to my unspeakable mortification   neither coach nor chair appeared     6 22 15  3 45 PM    Having travelled on foot a good way  in hope of finding a convenience   and being not only disappointed in that particular  but also bewildered  in my peregrination  I began to be exceedingly alarmed with the  apprehension of being met by some person who might know me  because in  that case  my design would undoubtedly have been discovered  from every  circumstance of my appearance at that time of day  for I had put on  the very clothes which I had pulled off overnight  so that my dress was  altogether odd and peculiar  My shoes were very fine  and over a large  hoop I wore a pink satin quilted petticoat trimmed with silver  which  was partly covered by a white dimity night gown  a full quarter of  a yard too short  my handkerchief and apron were hurried on without  pinning  my nightcap could not contain my hair  which hung about my  ears in great disorder  and my countenance denoted a mixture of hope and  fear  joy and shame    In this dilemma  I made my addresses to that honourable member of  society  a shoe black  whom I earnestly entreated to provide me with a  coach or chair  promising to reward him liberally for his trouble  but  he  having the misfortune to be lame  was unable to keep up with  my pace  so that by his advice and direction  I went into the first  public house I found open  where I stayed some time  in the utmost  consternation  among a crew of wretches whom I thought proper to bribe  for their civility  not without the terror of being stripped  At length   however  my messenger returned with a chair  of which I took immediate  possession  and fearing that  by this time  my family would be alarmed   and send directly to Lord W   s lodgings  I ordered myself to be carried  thither backwards  that so I might pass undiscovered    This stratagem succeeded according to my wish  I ran upstairs  in a  state of trepidation  to my faithful lover  who waited for me with the  most impatient and fearful suspense  At sight of me his eyes lightened  with transport  he caught me in his arms  as the richest present Heaven  could bestow  gave me to understand that my father had already sent to  his lodgings in quest of me  then applauding my love and resolution in  the most rapturous terms  he ordered a hackney coach to be called  and   that we might run no risk of separation  attended me to church  where we  were lawfully joined in the sight of Heaven    His fears were then all over  but mine recurred with double  aggravation  I dreaded the sight of my father  and shared all the sorrow  he suffered on account of my undutiful behaviour  for I loved him with  such piety of affection  that I would have endured every other species  of distress  rather than given him the least uneasiness  but love  where  he reigns in full empire  is altogether irresistible  surmounts every  difficulty  and swallows up all other considerations  This was the case  with me  and now the irrevocable step was taken  my first care was to  avoid his sight
