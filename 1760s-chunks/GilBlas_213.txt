must unquestionably be a new importation  not to have seen or heard of the divine Estella   The likeness was too perfect for me to be mistaken  It was easy to comprehend why Laura  changing her sphere of action  changed her name also  wherefore from curiosity to know how matters stood with her  since the public always pry into the most private concerns of theatrical persons  I inquired of the same man whether this Estella had any particular affair of gallantry on her hands  He informed me that for the last two months there had been a great Portuguese nobleman at Grenada  his name was the Marquis de Marialva  who had laid out a great deal of money upon her  He might have told me more  if I had not been afraid of becoming troublesome with my questions  I was better employed in musing on the information this good gentleman had given me  than in attending to the play  and if any one had asked me what it was all about  when the piece was over  I should have been puzzled for an answer  I could do nothing but decline Laura and Estella through all cases and numbers  till at length I boldly made up my mind to call at her house the next day  Not but there was some risk as to the reception she might give me  it might be suspected  without excess of modesty  that my appearance would give her no great pleasure in the high tide of her affairs  nor was it at all improbable that so good an actress  to revenge herself on a man  with whom certainly she had an account to settle  might look strange  and swear she had never seen his face before  Yet did none of these apprehensions deter me from my venture  After a light supper  for all the meals at my eating  house were regulated on principles of economy and temperance  I withdrew to my chamber with an anxious longing for the next day   My sleep was short and interrupted  so that I got up by daybreak  But as it was to be recollected that a mistress in high keep was not likely to be visible early in the morning  I passed three or four hours in dressing  shaving  powdering  and perfuming  It was my business to present myself before her in a trim  not to put her to the blush at acknowledging my acquaintance  I sallied forth about ten o clock  and knocked at her door  after having inquired her address at the theatre  She was living on the first floor of a large and elegant house  I told a chambermaid who opened the door to me  that a young man wanted to speak with her lady  The chambermaid went in to give my message  when all at once I heard her mistress call out  not in the best tempered tone in the world  Who is the young man  What does he want  Shew him up stairs   This was a hint to me that my time was ill chosen  that probably her Portuguese lover was at her toilette  and that she spoke so loud  with the laudable design of convincing him that she was not a sort of girl to allow of any impertinent intruders  This conjecture of mine turned out to be the fact  the Marquis de Marialva lounged away almost every morning with her  I had made up my mind to be kicked down stairs by way of welcome  but that admirable actress  never forgetting her cue  ran forward with open arms at the sight of me  exclaiming  Ah  my dear brother  is it you that I behold  On the strength of so near a kindred  she was no niggard of her embraces  but recollected her self so far as to say  turning round to the Portuguese  My lord  you must excuse me if nature will put in her claim  and trench upon good breeding  After three years of absence  I cannot see a brother once again  whom I love so tenderly  without expressing my feelings in all their warmth  Come  my dear Gil Blas  continued she  addressing me afresh  tell me some news of the family  in what circumstances did you leave it   This whimsical scene disconcerted me at first  but I was not long in seeing through Laura s intention  and playing up to her with a spirit scarcely less than her own  answered according to the plot  Heaven be praised  sister  all our good folks are in perfect health  and well in the world  I make no doubt  resumed she  but you must be very much surprised to find me an actress in Grenada  but hear me first and blame me afterwards  It is three years  as you may recollect  since my father thought to have established me advantageously in marriage with Don Antonio Coello  an officer in the service  who took me from the Asturias to Madrid  his native place  Six months after our arrival  he got into an affair of honour in consequence of his violent temper  Some attentions incautiously paid to me were the cause of the affray  and his antagonist was killed  This gentle man was of a family high in rank and interest  My husband  who though well born  had very few connections
