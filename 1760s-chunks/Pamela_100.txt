can pray for her  with   hearts so sincere and pure  that are not to be met with in palaces   Oh    how I long to throw myself at your feet  and receive from your own lips   the blessings of such good parents  But  alas  how are my prospects   again overclouded  to what they were when I closed my last parcel   More   trials  more dangers  I fear  must your poor Pamela be engaged in  But   through the Divine goodness  and your prayers  I hope  at last  to get   well out of all my difficulties  and the rather  as they are not the   effect of my own vanity or presumption       But I will proceed with my hopeless story  I saw Mr  Williams was a   little nettled at my impatience  and so I wrote to assure him I would be   as easy as I could  and wholly directed by him  especially as my father    whose respects I mentioned  had assured me my master was setting out for   London  which he must have somehow from his own family or he would not   have written me word of it          Saturday  Sunday       Mr  Williams has been here both these days  as usual  but is very   indifferently received still by Mrs  Jewkes  and  to avoid suspicion    I left them together  and went up to my closet  most of the time he was   here  He and she  I found by her  had a quarrel  and she seems quite out   of humour with him  but I thought it best not to say any thing  and he   said  he would very little trouble the house till he had an answer to   his letter from Mr  B      And she returned  The less  the better    Poor man  he has got but little by his openness  making Mrs  Jewkes his   confidant  as she bragged  and would have had me to do likewise       I am more and more satisfied there is mischief brewing  and shall begin   to hide my papers  and be circumspect  She seems mighty impatient for an   answer to her letter to my master          Monday  Tuesday  the 25th and 26th days of my heavy restraint       Still more and more strange things to write  A messenger is returned    and now all is out  O wretched  wretched Pamela  What  at last  will   become of me   Such strange turns and trials sure never poor creature    of my years  experienced  He brought two letters  one to Mrs  Jewkes    and one to me  but  as the greatest wits may be sometimes mistaken  they   being folded and sealed alike  that for me was directed to Mrs    Jewkes  and that for her was directed to me  But both are stark naught    abominably bad  She brought me up that directed for me  and said    Here s a letter for you  Long looked for is come at last  I will ask the   messenger a few questions  and then I will read mine  So she went down    and I broke it open in my closet  and found it directed To MRS  PAMELA   ANDREWS  But when I opened it  it began  Mrs  Jewkes  I was quite   confounded  but  thought I  this may be a lucky mistake  I may discover   something  And so I read on these horrid contents           MRS  JEWKES        What you write me  has given me no small disturbance  This wretched   fool s play thing  no doubt  is ready to leap at any thing that offers    rather than express the least sense of gratitude for all the benefits   she has received from my family  and which I was determined more and   more to heap upon her  I reserve her for my future resentment  and I   charge you double your diligence in watching her  to prevent her escape    I send this by an honest Swiss  who attended me in my travels  a man I   can trust  and so let him be your assistant  for the artful creature is   enough to corrupt a nation by her seeming innocence and simplicity  and   she may have got a party  perhaps  among my servants with you  as she   has here  Even John Arnold  whom I confided in  and favoured more than   any  has proved an execrable villain  and shall meet his reward for it        As to that college novice  Williams  I need not
