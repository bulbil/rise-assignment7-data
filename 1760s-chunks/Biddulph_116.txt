town  and ran away with Captain Gerrarde  in his march through it  upon an acquaintance of but a few days  The husband  who was passionately fond of her  concealed the meanness of her birth  and put her off to his relations for a young lady of a reputable family  with whom he got a good fortune  This induced his sister  a widow lady  the mother of Miss Burchell  to leave at her death the care of the unhappy girl to captain Gerrarde  The captain  whose infirmities increased fast upon him a few years after his marriage  got leave to retire upon half pay into the country  and he lived for the most part at Ashby  a little estate which he had purchased and settled upon his wife  it seems he had a pretty good personal fortune  which she had squandered  for his fondness could refuse her nothing  except living apart from him at London  which he could never consent to  though it was always her desire  but being debarred of this  she betook herself to such pleasures as the country afforded  and was always a leading woman at horse races  assemblies  and such other amusements  as were within her reach  which  together with expensive treats at home  and card playing  her supreme delight  left her at his death  which happened about five years after their marriage  in the indigent state she in her account of herself to Mr Faulkland acknowleges  It was then Mr Arnold became acquainted with her  and in the manner she    represented  for my brother has lately fallen into the acquaintance of that very relation  as she calls him  which she mentions  a Mr Pinnick  at whose lodgings they first met  This gentleman  who was in reality nothing more than an humble servant of the lady’s  though she called him cousin  the better to skreen a more particular connection  was so provoked at her deserting him in favour of Mr Arnold  whom he said he was sure she had insnared  that he made no scruple of telling all he knew of her  He said  she had two brothers  very great profligates  one of whom had been put into prison for forgery  and would have been hanged  had not Mr Arnold  at the expence of a very considerable sum  saved his life  The other  some very mean retainer to the law  a plausible fellow  and Mrs Gerrarde’s great favourite  for whom she had art and influence enough to prevail on Mr Arnold to purchase a considerable employment  It would be endless  said Mr Pinnick  to tell you the variety of stratagems she made use of to get money out of those whom she had in her power  and who were able to supply her  I  for my part  was not rich enough for her  which was the chief reason I suppose of Mr Arnold’s supplanting me  and I take it for granted  that those arts  which she practised on me to little effect  succeeded better with him  One time her poor father was in gaol  and his whole family would be undone  and her mother sent a begging  if he was not relieved from his distress  by a trifling sum  fifty pounds would do  Another time her sister’s husband  a country shopkeeper  was upon the point of breaking  and would be inevitably ruined if he was not assisted  And then she had a formal letter to produce from her sister upon the melancholy occasion  These circumstances she made no scruple of laying open to me  as she knew I was no stranger to her origin  having resided for some years in the town where she formerly lived  though I did not then know her  Her mother was a Roman Catholick  and in order to have her daughter brought up in the same principles with herself  had her sent to a relation in Dublin  where she received her education in a nunnery  Though her artifices to get money from me were grown quite stale  I make no doubt but she practised them all over again on poor Arnold  She was not contented with the lodgings I had placed her in  but obliged him to take a handsome house  elegantly furnished for her  a very fine chariot and horses were the next purchase  for a hired one the lady would not vouchsafe to sit in  and I am sure I have seen her in the boxes at the play  with as many jewels on her as any lady there   All these ungrateful particulars  which Sir George had received    from Mr Pinnick  he took a sort of ill natured pleasure in repeating to my mother and me  Unhappy Mr Arnold  into what a gulph didst thou unwarily plunge thyself  Is it not amazing that this affair was even so long a secret  That it was so to me is not strange  for it is natural to suppose that I must have been the last person to receive a hint of this nature  but that my brother should never have been informed of it is surprizing  ’Tis certain Mr Arnold was at first very cautious in his visits  making them generally at night  and even then he never was carried in his own chariot  I am shocked to think
