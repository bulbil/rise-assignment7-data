 of their success  on account of his sister s delicacy which could not  pardon the least shadow of disrespect  He owned  indeed  he was not  certain that she would appear in the same company with Pickle  but  as  she made no stipulation on that score  he would interpret her silence  in the most favourable manner  and keep her in ignorance of his design   until she should find it too late to retract with any decency  The hope  of seeing and conversing with Emilia  and perhaps of being reconciled  to her  after having suffered so much and so long from her displeasure   raised a tumult of ideas in his breast  and produced a strange  inquietude of joy and perturbation  Gauntlet having stayed with him a  few days  and signified the time appointed for his spousals  took his  leave  in order to prepare for the occasion  while Peregrine  with his  friend Hatchway  made a tour among his acquaintance in the country  with  a view of sounding their inclinations touching a project which he had  lately conceived  of offering himself as a candidate for a certain  borough in the neighbourhood  at the ensuing election for members of  parliament   This scheme  which was suggested to him by one of his quality patrons   would have succeeded according to his wish  had the election taken place  immediately  but  before that happened  his interest was overbalanced  by some small accidents that will be recorded in the sequel  In the  meantime  he repaired to Windsor on the eve of his friend s marriage   and understood from Godfrey that it was with the utmost difficulty he  and Sophy could prevail upon his sister to be present at the wedding   when she was informed that her lover was invited  and that her consent    6 22 15  3 45 PM   had not been obtained until they had promised  on the part of Peregrine   that he should not renew the old topic  nor even speak to her in the  style of a former acquaintance   Our young gentleman was nettled at this preliminary  to which  however   he said he would adhere  and so well did he think himself fortified with  pride and resentment  that he resolved to behave towards her with such  indifference  as would  he hoped  mortify her vanity  and thereby  punish her for the implacability of her disposition  Armed with these  sentiments  he was next day introduced by Godfrey to the bride  who  received him with her usual sweetness of temper and affability  and  Emilia being present  he saluted her with a distant bow  which she  acknowledged with a cold courtesy  and an aspect of ice  Though  this deportment confirmed his displeasure  her beauty undermined his  resolution  he thought her charms infinitely improved since their last  parting  and a thousand fond images recurring to his imagination  he  felt his whole soul dissolving into tenderness and love   In order to banish those dangerous ideas  he endeavoured to enter into a  gay conversation with Sophy  on the subject of the approaching ceremony   but his tongue performed its office awkwardly  his eyes were attracted  towards Emilia  as if they had been subject to the power of fascination   in spite of all his efforts  a deep sigh escaped from his bosom  and  his whole appearance indicated anxiety and confusion  The bridegroom   perceiving his condition  abridged the visit  and having conducted his  companion to his own lodgings  expressed his concern at having been the  innocent occasion of his uneasiness  by exposing him to the sight of  Emilia  which he perceived had given him pain  Peregrine  who had by  this time recollected the dictates of his pride  assured him  that he  was very much mistaken in the cause of his disorder  which was no other  than a sudden qualm  to which he had been for some time subject  and to  show him how philosophically he could bear the disdain of Emilia  which   with all deference to her conduct  he could not help thinking a little  too severe  he desired  as the bridegroom had made preparation for a  private ball in the evening  that he would provide him with an agreeable  partner  in which case he would exhibit undoubted proofs of the  tranquility of his heart   I was in hopes   answered Godfrey   of being  able  with the assistance of Sophy  to make up matters between you and  my sister  and for that reason kept her unengaged to any other gentleman  for the night  but since she was so peevishly obstinate  I shall take  care to accommodate you with a very handsome young lady  whose partner  will not be sorry to exchange her for Emilia    The thoughts of having an opportunity to coquette with another woman   under the eye of this implacable mistress  supported his spirits during  the ceremony  which put Gauntlet in possession of his heart s desire   and  by means of this cordial  he found himself so undisturbed at  dinner
