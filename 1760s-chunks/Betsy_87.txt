read  with an audible voice    these lines             To Charles Trueworth  Esq            Sir            When I proposed the decision of our fate by force of arms  I        offered  at the same time  that the glory of serving Miss Betsy        should be the victor s triumph  This your too great modesty        declined  but  Sir  though you scorned to accept the advantage your        superior skill acquired  your generosity  in spite of you  has        gained  I love Miss Betsy  and would have maintained my claim        against all who should have dared dispute her with me  while        justice and while honour permitted me to do so  but though I am        unfortunate  I never can be base  My life  worthless as it is  has        twice been in your power  and I should be no less hateful to        myself  than contemptible to the world  should I offer to interrupt        the peace of him that gave it  May you be as successful in love as        you have been in fight  and the amiable object be convinced of her        own happiness in making yours  I desist for ever from the vain        hopes I once was flattered with  and the first wish my soul now        harbours is  to be worthy the title of your friend  as I am bound        to avow myself  with the greatest sincerity  Sir  your most obliged        and most humble servant            T  STAPLE         Nothing   said Mr  Goodman  as soon as he had done reading   can equal   your generosity in forming this resolution  but the wisdom in persisting   in it  and if I find you do so  shall have more reason to congratulate   you upon it  than I should think I had on the success of your wishes in   marrying Miss Betsy         I should laugh now   cried Mr  Chatfree   if Mr  Trueworth  in a fit of   generosity too  should also take it into his head to resign his   pretensions  and chuse to wear the willow  instead of the   myrtle garland  because you do so     He has already proved his   generosity   replied Mr  Staple  with a sigh  which he was unable to   restrain   and has no need to give the severe testimony you mention  if   he is so happy as you seem to think he is  but   continued he   it is   not my business to examine who yields  or who pursues  Miss Betsy  I am   fixed in my determination to see her no more  and  as soon as I am   recovered from the hurts I have received on her account  will go into   the country  and seek a cure in absence for my unavailing passion        Neither Mr  Goodman nor Mr  Chatfree were so old as to have forgot how   hard it is for a youthful heart to give up it s darling wishes  and   sacrifice desire to discretion  They said abundance of handsome things    omitting nothing which they imagined might add to the fortitude of his   present way of thinking  He  on the other hand  to take from them all   remains of doubt concerning the sincerity of his intentions  sealed the   letter he had wrote to Mr  Trueworth  and sent it to that gentleman    while they were in the room       Mr  Goodman was extremely pleased in his mind  that an affair  which    for some time past  had given him a good deal of anxiety  was in so fair   a way of being ended without farther mischief  he took no notice    however  on his return home  at least  not before Miss Betsy  of the   visit he had been making  or that he knew any thing more of Mr  Staple    than what she had been told herself by Mr  Chatfree       In the mean time  this young lady affected to appear more grave than   ordinary  I say  affected to be so  for as she had been at first shocked   by Mr  Chatfree s report
