 who had reasons for keeping themselves concealed  and had like  to have been very severely handled for his impertinent curiosity  Being  unsuccessful in all his attempts  he entered into a treaty with one  Sir R   H    a person of a very indifferent character  who undertook  to furnish him with an infallible expedient to discover the place of my  abode  if he would gratify him with a bond for a thousand pounds  which  being executed accordingly  this worthy knight advertised me and my maid  in the public papers  offering one hundred pounds as a reward to any  person who should disclose the place of our retirement    As soon as the paper fell into my hands  I was again involved in  perplexity  and  being afraid of staying in town  resolved  with the  concurrence of my lover  to accept of an invitation I had received from  the duke of K    who had by this time arrived in England  with that lady  whom I have already mentioned as one of our parties at Paris  Having  visited my little infant  I next day set out for the duke s country  seat  which is a most elegant chateau  and stands in a charming  situation  Mr  S    followed in a few days  We met with a very cordial  reception  his grace was civil and good natured  lived nobly  and loved  pleasure  Madame de la T   was formed to please  There was always a  great deal of company in the house  so that we passed our time agreeably  in playing at billiards and cards  hunting  walking  reading  and  conversation    But my terms of happiness were generally of short duration  In the  midst of this felicity I was overtaken by a most severe affliction  in  the death of my dear hapless infant  who had engrossed a greater share  of my tenderness than perhaps I even should have paid to the offspring  of a legitimate contract  because the circumstance of her birth would  have been an insurmountable misfortune to her through the whole course  of her life  and rendered her absolutely dependent on my love and  protection    While I still lamented the untimely fate of this fair blossom  Lord     came down  and demanded me as his wife  but the suit which I then  maintained against him deprived him  for the present  of a husband s  right  and therefore the duke would not deliver me into his hands   In six months he repeated his visit and demand  and an agreement was  patched up  in consequence of which I consented to live in the same  house with him  on condition that he should never desire to sleep with  me  or take any other measure to disturb my peace  otherwise I should  be at liberty to leave him again  and entitled to the provision of a  separate maintenance  To these articles I assented  by the advice of my  lawyers  with a view of obtaining the payment of my pin money  which I  had never received since our parting  but subsisted on the sale of my  jewels  which were very considerable  and had been presented to me with  full power of alienation  As to my lover  he had no fortune to support  me  and for that reason I was scrupulously cautious of augmenting his  expense    We had now enjoyed each other s company for three years  during which  our mutual passions had suffered no abatement  nor had my happiness been  mixed with any considerable alloy  except that late stroke of providence  which I have already mentioned  and the reflection of the sorrow that  my conduct had entailed upon my dear father  whom I loved beyond  expression  and whom nothing could have compelled me to disoblige but a  more powerful flame  that prevailed over every other consideration  As I    6 22 15  3 45 PM   was now forced to break off this enchanting correspondence  it is not to  be doubted that our parting cost us the most acute sensations of grief  and disappointment  However  there was no remedy  I tore myself from  his arms  took my leave of the family  after having acknowledged my  obligations to the duke  and set out for the place of rendezvous  where  I was met by my lord  attended by a steward whom he had lately engaged   and who was one chief cause of our future separations  My lord  having  quitted his house in town  conducted me to his lodgings in Pall Mall   and insisted upon sleeping with me the first night  but I refused to  gratify his desire  on the authority of our agreement    This dispute produced a quarrel  in consequence of which I attempted to  leave the house  He endeavouring to prevent my retreat  I fairly locked  him in  ran down stairs  and  calling a hackney coach  made the best of  my way into the city  to my father s lodgings  where I lay  the family
