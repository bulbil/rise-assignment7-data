after all  Lucy  that parents will educate creatures so differently  who are to live with and for each other       Every possible means is used  even from infancy  to soften the minds of women  and to harden those of men  the contrary endeavor might be of use  for the men creatures are unfeeling enough by nature  and we are born too tremblingly alive to love  and indeed to every soft affection       Your brother is almost the only one of his sex I know  who has the tenderness of woman with the spirit and firmness of man  a circumstance which strikes every woman who converses with him  and which contributes to make him the favorite he is amongst us  Foolish women who cannot distinguish characters may possibly give the preference to a coxcomb  but I will venture to say  no woman of sense was ever much acquainted with Colonel Rivers without feeling for him an affection of some kind or other       A propos to women  the estimable part of us are divided into two classes only  the tender and the lively       The former  at the head of which I place Emily  are infinitely more capable of happiness  but  to counterbalance this advantage  they are also capable of misery in the same degree  We of the other class  who feel less keenly  are perhaps upon the whole as happy  at least I would fain think so       For example  if Emily and I marry our present lovers  she will certainly be more exquisitely happy than I shall  but if they should change their minds  or any accident prevent our coming together  I am inclined to fancy my situation would be much the most agreable       I should pout a month  and then look about for another lover  whilst the tender Emily would    Sit like patience on a monument     and pine herself into a consumption         Adieu  They wait for me   Yours   A  FERMOR   Tuesday  midnight       We have had a very agreable day  Lucy  a pretty enough kind of a ball  and every body in good humor  I danced with Fitzgerald  whom I never knew so agreable       Happy love is gay  I find  Emily is all sprightliness  your brother s eyes have never left her one moment  and her blushes seemed to shew her sense of the distinction  I never knew her look so handsome as this day       Do you know I felt for Madame Des Roches  Emily was excessively complaisant to her  she returned her civility  but I could perceive a kind of constraint in her manner  very different from the ease of her behaviour when we saw her before  she felt the attention of Rivers to Emily very strongly  in short  the ladies seemed to have changed characters for the day       We supped with your brother on our return  and from his windows  which look on the river St  Charles  had the pleasure of observing one of the most beautiful objects imaginable  which I never remember to have seen before this evening       You are to observe the winter method of fishing here  is to break openings like small fish ponds on the ice  to which the fish coming for air  are taken in prodigious quantities on the surface       To shelter themselves from the excessive cold of the night  the fishermen build small houses of ice on the river  which are arranged in a semicircular form  and extend near a quarter of a mile  and which  from the blazing fires within  have a brilliant transparency and vivid lustre  not easy either to imagine or to describe  the starry semicircle looks like an immense crescent of diamonds  on which the sun darts his meridian rays       Absolutely  Lucy  you see nothing in Europe  you are cultivated  you have the tame beauties of art  but to see nature in her lovely wild luxuriance  you must visit your brother when he is prince of the Kamaraskas       Adieu   Your faithful  A  FERMOR       The variety  as well of grand objects  as of amusements  in this country  confirms me in an opinion I have always had  that Providence had made the conveniences and inconveniences of life nearly equal every where       We have pleasures here even in winter peculiar to the climate  which counterbalance the evils we suffer from its rigor       Good night  my dear Lucy     LETTER CXV   115   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   Quebec  April 2   I HAVE this moment  my dear  a letter from Montreal  describing some lands on Lake Champlain  which my friend thinks much better worth my taking than those near the Kamaraskas  he presses me to come up immediately to see them  as the ice on the rivers will in a few days be dangerous to travel on       I am strongly inclined to go  and for this reason  I am convinced my wish of bringing about a friendship between Emily and Madame Des Roches  the strongest reason I had for fixing at the Kamaraskas
