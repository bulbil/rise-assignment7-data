 I was a charming young Lady   My Mother wept—O Sir  said she to my guardian  And dropping down in a chair by the window  not a word more could she speak   I ran to her  and clasped my arms about her  She wept the more  I wiped her eyes with her own handkerchief  I told her  it went to my heart to see her cry  I begged she would spare me this grief   She clasped her arms then about me  and kissed my cheek  and my forehead  O thought I  it is very good of you  my dear mother   Then came my guardian to us  and he kindly took my mother s hand  and conducted her to the fire side  and he led me  and placed me by her  at the tea table  and he made the Major and the Captain sit down by him  So much graciousness in his countenance  O madam  I shall be an Idolater  I am afraid  And he said  Emily  my dear  you will make tea for us  My sister dined abroad  madam  to my Mother —Yes  Sir  I will  said I  And I was as lively as a bird   But before the servants came in  Let me tell you  madam  said he  what Miss Jervois has proposed to me —They were in silent expectation     75 She has desired that you  Major  will accept from her  for your mutual ease  of an additional 100l  a year  which I shall order to be paid you quarterly  during Mrs  O Hara s life  not doubting but you will make her as happy as it is in your power to make her   My mother bowed  coloured with gratitude  and looked obliged   And she begs of you  madam  turning to my mother  that you will accept as from the Major  another 100l  a year  for pin money  which he  or which you  madam  will draw upon me for  also quarterly  if you choose not to trouble him to do it  For this 100l  a year must be appropriated to your sole and separate use  madam  and not be subject to your controul  Major O Hara   Good God  Sir  said the Major —What a wretch was I  the last time I was here —There is no bearing of this   He got up  and went to the window  And the Captain said  blessed Jesu  and something else  which I could not mind  for I was weeping like a baby   What  Sir  said my mother  400l  a year  Do you mean so —I do  madam—And  Sir  to be so generously paid me my 100l  of it  as if I received it not from my child  but from my husband —Good God  How you overpower me  Sir  What shame  what remorse  do you strike into my heart   And my poor mother s tears ran down as fast as mine   O madam  said the dear girl to me  clasping her arms about me  how your tender heart is touched —It is well you were not there   Dr  Bartlett came in to tea  My guardian would not permit Antony  who offered himself  to wait  Antony had been my own papa s servant  when my mother was not so good   Nothing but blessings  nothing but looks and words of admiration and gratitude  passed all the tea time    76 How their hearts rejoiced I warrant —Is it not a charming thing  madam  to make people s hearts glad —To be sure it is  How many hearts has my guardian rejoiced  You must bid him be cross to me  or I shall not know what to do with myself —But then  if he was  I should only get by myself  and cry  and be angry with myself  and think he could not be to blame   O my love  my Emily  said I  take care of your gratitude  That drew in your true Friend   Well  but how can it be helped  madam  Can a right heart be ungrateful  Dr  Bartlett says  There is no such thing as true happiness in this life  And is it not better to be unhappy from good men and women  than from bad —Dear madam  why you have often made me unhappy  because of your goodness to me  and because I knew  that I neither could deserve nor return it   The dear prater went on—My guardian called me aside  when tea was over  My Emily  said he— I do love he should call me his Emily —But all the world is his Emily  I think  Let me see what you will do with these two notes  giving me two Bank notes of 25l  each —Present pin money and cash may be wanted  We will suppose that your mother has been married a quarter of a year  Her pin money and the additional annuity may commence from the 25th of December last  Let me  Emily  when they go away  see the graceful mannner
