we went to bed  —   I ll be hanged  said she  if Sawny Waddle the pedlar has not got up in a dream and done it  for I heard him very obstropulous in his sleep —Sure I put a chamber pot under his bed  —  With these words she advanced to the bed in which he lay  and finding the sheets cold  she exclaimed    Good lack a daisy  the rogue is fled  —   Fled  cried I  with a feigned amazement  G—d forbid —Sure he has not robbed us  —  Then springing up  I laid hold of my breeches  and emptied all my loose money into my hand  which having reckoned  I said  Heaven be praised our money is all safe —Strap  look to the knapsack —He did so  and found all was right —Upon which  we asked with seeming concern  if he had stole nothing belonging to the house —   No  no  replied she  he has stole nothing but his reckoning    which  it seems  this pious pedlar   57 had forgot to discharge in the midst of his devotion —Betty  after a moment s pause withdrew  and immediately we could hear her waken Rifle  who no sooner heard of Waddle s flight  than he jumped out of bed and dressed  venting a thousand execrations  and vowing to murder the pedlar if ever he could set eyes on him again    For  said he  the scoundrel has by this time raised the hue and cry against me  —  Having dressed himself in a hurry  he mounted his horse  and for that time rid us of his company and a thousand fears that were the consequence of it —While we were at breakfast  Betty endeavoured by all the cunning she was mistress of  to learn whether or no we suspected our fellow lodger  whom we saw take horse  but as we were on our guard  we answered her sly questions with a simplicity she could not distrust  when all of a sudden  we heard the trampling of a horse s feet at the door  This noise alarmed Strap so much  whose imagination was wholly engrossed by the image of Rifle  that with a countenance as pale as milk  he cried out    O Lord  there s the highwayman returned  —  Our landlady startled at these words  said    What highwayman  young man —Do you think any highwaymen harbour here  —  Though I was very much disconcerted at this piece of indiscretion in Strap  I had presence of mind enough to tell her  we had met a horse man the day before  whom Strap had foolishly supposed to be a highwayman  because he rode with pistols  and that he was terrified at the sound of a horse s feet ever since —She forced a smile at the ignorance and timorousness of my comrade  but I could perceive   not   58 without great concern  that this account was not at all satisfactory to her     CHAP  IX   We proceed on our journey—are overtaken by an highwayman who fires at Strap  is prevented from shooting me by a company of horsemen  who ride in pursuit of him—Strap is put to bed at an inn —Adventures at that inn   AFTER having paid our score  and taken leave of our hostess  who embraced me tenderly at parting  we proceeded on our journey  blessing our selves that we had come off so well  We had not walked above five miles  when we observed a man on horse back galloping after us  whom we in a short time recognized to be no other than this formidable hero who had already given us so much vexation —He stopped hard by me  and asked if I knew who he was —My astonishment had disconcerted me so much  that I did not hear his question  which he repeated with a volley of oaths and threats  but I remained as mute as before —Strap seeing my discomposure  fell upon his knees in the mud  uttering with a lamentable voice  these words     For Ch—st s sake  have mercy upon us  Mr  Rifle  we know you very well  —   O ho  cried the thief  you do —but by G—d  you never shall be evidence against me in this world  you dog  —  So saying  he drew a   59 pistol  and fired it at the unfortunate shaver  who fell flat upon the ground without speaking one word —My comrade s fate  and my own situation  rivetted me to the place where I stood  deprived of all sense and reflection  so that I did not make the least attempt either to run away  or deprecate the wrath of this barbarian  who snapped a second pistol at me  but before he had time to prime again  perceived a company of horse men coming up  whereupon he rode off  and left me standing motionless as a statue  in which posture I was sound by those whose appearance had saved my life —This company  which consisted of three men in livery  well armed  was headed by an officer  who  as I afterwards learned  was the person from whom Rifle had taken the
