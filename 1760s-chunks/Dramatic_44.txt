innovation of the unities of time  and place  even in Mr  Punch —because  as the coffee house connoisseurs observed  it is more instructive  and more elegant  even to be lulled into a slumber  by the rules of art  than kept awake  and in spirits  by all the fire of fancy  contrary to the Greek and French scale or standard     At that time Mrs  Charke  sister to the late Mr  Theophilus Cibber  had a famous puppet show  which was conducted with such regularity —To compare the puppet shows of that time  with the puppet shows of this time  would be only an ill natured attempt  But Charlotte Charke used to pride herself  that her company  her ladies at least  were all vestals  Because  as she said  a lady belonging to the Theatres  Page  135  Royal may be weak enough  or fond enough  or mean enough  and mercenary enough  to descend being upon the town  But who   Mrs  Charke used to exult  who can say  they ever supped with the Queen of Sheba  at the Shakespear  or had fair Rosamond at Haddock s     This daughter of Colley Cibber  the late Poet Laureate  was a lady of surprising singularity  but the oddities of the human mind are unaccountable     There is his honour Sir         a great politician  yet all his delight is chucking six pence into a quart decanter     Is not Mr        the great physician  an admirer of parched peas  but cannot eat any  except what he cooks himself     Mr        the famous mathematician  prefers battledore and shuttle cock  to painting  poetry  and music  and don t we all know several dignified       who  though amazingly orthodox  value themselves more upon their taste  in venison  and Madeira  than in interpreting the scriptures     Some ladies of distinction have been known to admire low company  their husbands at the same time not caring for any  but it is impossible to account why we are whim bitten  So far has oddity been epidemical  that noblemen have been known  nay  and several at this time are  really fond of their wives  and what is as remarkable  their ladies are as warm in their affections for their husbands     Our minds will be attached to irregularities  Miss      with the finest eyes in England  affects to be near sighted  and Lady        a most charming figure  drawn by elegance  and  Page  136  dressed by grace—chuses to appear round shouldered     Sir         one of our most eloquent speakers  and a gentleman of amazing learning  believes he can spin a top  better than any other man in England  and wants to have 500 upon it     The Rt         who has seven of the finest children  perhaps in Christendom  has impaired his estate  in purchasing and preparing butterfly wings  to line his study  in imitation of tapestry  And Mr       the most eminent attorney in Great Britain  employs his whole time in gudgeon fishing     This Mr  Warner above mentioned  had an oddity of temper  which is uncommon among theatrical managers  He never looked upon his people  to be off the Stage as good as himself  he never chose to countenance them as acquaintance  or be familiar with them as friends     A fortnight or three weeks preceding the Borough fair  he used to have a great levee of people in the business  although at that instant perhaps out of employ  who would wait upon him  to know if he wanted any hands in the acting  singing  dancing  hocus pocus  or hannock and jannock way     They used at first to come about dinner time  and no person keeps a better house than he does  or understands it better  there was always something good in the pot  or roasting at the fire  There would they walk up and down the kitchen — now glancing at the meat  now at the master  sometimes darting their eyes down  desponding into the dripping pan  then eagerly expectant  lift them up again to the boiler  and  Page  137  then they would strut across the kitchen  and spout  and say  to be  or not to be  and Jemmy would laugh  and whisper me  saying  not to be eat by them colls  I assure you     Some of these passages I was remarking to Mr  Warner  and we were thinking of old affairs  and I just had told him of the dripping pan  and the tragedy and comedy people  as Mr  Zaphaniel and the dancing master came in  we went up one pair of stairs  and there I was shewn MASTER EDWARD and MISS ANN  walking arm in arm up and down the
