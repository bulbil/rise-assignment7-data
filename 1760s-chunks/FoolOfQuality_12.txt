is now acting at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane  by   Henry Brooke  Esq   author of Gusavus Vasa  22nd January  1761      This play is certainly much superior to either of the two former ones   on this story  etc    etc      Dublin  29th September  Crow Street Theatre  Mr  Brooke has   written a Farce in which Mr  Barry and Mrs  Dancer are to perform    Whitehall Evening Post  8th October  1767      Dublin  ist November  We are to have two new pieces brought out   at the theatre this season  if we can get actors       the one  a tragedy    by Mr  Brooke  author of Gustavus Vasa  Whitehall Evening Post    1 2th November  1768      Brooke died at Dublin on the loth October  1783    1 He died   says Miss Brooke    as he lived a Christian    With the meekness of a lamb  and the fortitude of a hero    he supported the tedious infirmities of age  the languors of   sickness  and the pains of dissolution   and his death  like   his life  was instructive     My father was the best of men    Yet he did not die rejoicing  He died resigned  meek    humble  It is the Lord  let him do what seemeth him   good   He was buried in his father s old churchyard at         INTRODUCTION xxiii     Mullagh 1   In 1852    B    the Rev  Richard Sinclair Brooke    father of the Rev  Stopford Brooke  who wrote the memoir   of Henry Brooke for the Dublin University Magazine    describes in the same periodical how he met with a very   old and wrinkled woman  by name Judith Gallaspie  who   pointed out the precise spot where Henry Brooke was   buried   for   seventy long years ago she  as a young   colleen  went with the whole country side to Kells to meet   the funeral coming from Dublin    And she told of the   tombstone and enclosure which had been erected  but now   was all broken down and displaced  and scarce a vestige   remained save a few sunken stones  But the ancient crone   stooped over the sod  and with her long staff  as with a   diviner s rod  she traced the lines  and accurately squared   the spot where close under the south western wall of the   ruin  and   in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to   eternal life   lay the gentle dust of one in whom were   singularly combined the highest intellect with the humblest   graces of a Christian  Here indeed is no tomb or   monumental marble   but in the absence of all such decay    able matter  God s sun shines perennially on the spot  and   every evening its descending beams will visit the old ruin    and with their rich and tender light rest on the good man s   grave  bathing the green sod in glory   I have quoted this   passage for the sake of the reverent feeling that it shows for   the memory of Brooke  Such a feeling was by no means con    fined to his own relatives  Among the lines written to his   memory may be quoted those by the honest blacksmith at   Longfield  who wrote them the moment he heard of his   master s death       Here lies a head with learning fill d      A tongue in Greek and Latin skill d       A heart to pity always prone      That felt for sorrows not his own       A hand still ready to relieve       The poor  indeed  may truly grieve      His very looks reliev d their wants      And brighten d up their gloomy haunts       An eye that wink d at others  failings      And ears close shut to noise and railings      A foot that often trod in youth     The paths that lead to praise and truth      1 It is curious that on the register of St  Michan s Church  Dublin    appears this entry   1783  October 22  H  Brooks   It may be a   coincidence  or perhaps the entry was to fulfil some formality in   connection with removing the body to County Cavan          xxiv INTRODUCTION     In all extremities a friend    Slow  slow to borrow  quick to lend    In all his acts sincere
