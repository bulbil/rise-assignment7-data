within her sight  This base  inhuman  treatment  instead of answering the end proposed  produced such a  contrary effect  that the duke of B    by a codicil to his will  in  which he reflects upon Lord A   s evil temper  directed his executors to  pay to his daughter an annuity of one hundred pounds  while her lord and  she should continue to live separate  and this allowance was to cease on  Lord A   s death    While she remained in this solitary situation  the child was  universally known and received as the legitimate son and heir of her  lord  whose affection for the boy was so conspicuous  that  in the midst  of his own necessities  he never failed to maintain him in the dress and  equipage of a young nobleman  In the course of his infancy  his father  having often changed his place of residence  the child was put under  the instructions of a great many different schoolmasters  so that he was  perfectly well known in a great many different parts of the kingdom  and  his mother seized all opportunities  which were but rare  on account of  his father s orders to the contrary  of seeing and giving him proofs  of her maternal tenderness  until she set out for England  after having  been long in a declining state of health  by a paralytical disorder   upon the consequence of which  such dependence was placed by her  inconsiderate husband  who was by this time reduced to extreme poverty   that he actually married a woman whom he had long kept as a mistress   This creature no sooner understood that Lady A   was departed from  Ireland  than she openly avowed her marriage  and went about publicly  with Lord A    visiting his acquaintances in the character of his wife    From this era may be dated the beginning of Mr  A   s misfortune  This  artful woman  who had formerly treated the child with an appearance of  fondness  in order to ingratiate herself with the father  now looking  upon herself as sufficiently established in the family  thought it was  high time to alter her behaviour with regard to the unfortunate boy     6 22 15  3 45 PM   and accordingly  for obvious reasons  employed a thousand artifices to  alienate the heart of the weak father from his unhappy offspring   Yet  notwithstanding all her insinuations  nature still maintained her  influence in his heart  and though she often found means to irritate  him by artful and malicious accusations  his resentment never extended  farther than fatherly correction  She would have found it impossible  to accomplish his ruin  had not her efforts been reinforced by a new  auxiliary  who was no other than his uncle  the present usurper of  his title and estate  yet even this confederacy was overawed  in some  measure  by the fear of alarming the unfortunate mother  until her  distemper increased to a most deplorable degree of the dead palsy  and  the death of her father had reduced her to a most forlorn and abject  state of distress  Then they ventured upon the execution of their  projects  and  though their aims were widely different  concurred in  their endeavours to remove the hapless boy  as the common obstacle to  both    Lord A   who  as I have already observed  was a man of weak intellects   and utterly void of any fixed principle of action  being by this time  reduced to such a pitch of misery  that he was often obliged to pawn his  wearing apparel in order to procure the common necessaries of life  and  having no other fund remaining  with which he could relieve his present  necessities  except a sale of the reversion of the A   estate  to  which the nonage of his son was an effectual bar  he was advised by  his virtuous brother  and the rest of his counsellors  to surmount this  difficulty  by secreting his son  and spreading a report of his death   This honest project he the more readily embraced  because he knew that  no act of his could frustrate the child s succession  Accordingly  the  boy was removed from the school at which he was then boarded  to the  house of one K    an agent and accomplice of the present earl of A     where he was kept for several months closely confined  and  in the  meantime  it was industriously reported that he was dead    This previous measure being taken  Lord A   published advertisements  in the gazettes  offering reversions of the A   estate to sale  and  emissaries of various kinds were employed to inveigle such as were  ignorant of the nature of the settlement of these estates  or strangers  to the affairs of his family  Some people  imposed upon by the report of  the child s death  were drawn in to purchase  thinking themselves safe  in the concurrence of his lordship s brother  upon presumption that  he was
