My reputation  therefore  as an obedient wife  with all those whose good opinion was worth courting  is gone  And is not this enough to make one careless   BLESS me  my dear  This man of errors has committed  if possible  a still worse fault  He regards me not as any body  The Earl and he have been long Page  50 uneasy  it seems  that we live at the expence of my brother  to whom there is no making returns  and a house offering in Grosvenor square  he has actually contracted for it  without consulting me  I must own that I cannot in my heart disapprove either of the motive  or the house  as I have the latter described to me  But his doing it of his own head  is an insolent act of prerogative  Don t you in conscience think so  Does he not  by this step  make me his chattles  a piece of furniture only  to be removed as any other piece of furniture  or picture  or cabinet  at his pleasure   He came to me—I hope  madam  in a reproaching accent  I have done something now that will please you  Ought his stiff air  and the reflecting word NOW  to have gone unpunish d  Hast thou found out any other old maid  to fit in judgment on the behaviour of thy wife  But what hast thou done —I was astonished when the man told me   And who is to be thy housekeeper  Is this done in  hope I ll follow thee  Or dost thou intend to exclude from thy habitation the poor woman who met thee at church a few weeks ago   Just then came in Lady L  I asked her  what she thought of this step   Had she vindicated him  I never would have regarded a word she said between us  But she owned  that she thought I should have been consulted  And then he began to see that he had done a wrong thing  I acquainted her with his former sault  unatoned for as it was—Why  as to that  she did not know what to say  only  that it became my character  and good sense  so to behave  as that Lord G  should have no reason to complain of me to any body  A hard thing  Harriet  to be reflected upon by an own sister   LADY L  prevailed upon me  unknown to Lord G  to go with her to see this house   Tis a handsome Page  51 house  I have but the one aforesaid objection to it—But let me ask you again  Is not the slight he has put upon me  in taking it without consulting me  an inexcusable thing  —I know you will say it is  But I ll tell you how I think to do—I will make him give up the contract  and when he has done so  unknown to him  take the same house myself  This will be returning the compliment  His excuse is  He was sure I should like the house and the terms  If he is sure of my liking it  and has chosen it himself  the duce is in it  if I may not be sure of his—Would he dislike it  because I liked it —Say so  if you dare Harriet  and suppose me blameable   O my dear  What shall I do with this passionate man  I could not  you know  forgive him for the two unatoned for steps which he had taken  without some contrition  And do you think he would shew any —Not he —I said something that set him up  something bordering upon the whimsical—No matter what  He pranced upon it  I  with my usual meekness  calmly rebuked him  and then went to my harpsichord  And  what do you think  How shall I tell it  Yet to you I may—Why then he whisked his hat from under his arm  he was going out   and silenced  broke  demolished  my poor harpsichord   I was surprized  But instantly recovering myself  You are a violent wretch  Lord G  said I  quite calmly  How could you do so —Suppose  and I took the wicked hat  I should throw it into the fire  But I gave it to him  and made him a fine courtesy  There was command of temper  I thought  at the instant of Epictetus and his snapt leg  Was I not as great a Philosopher   HE is gone out  Dinner is ready  and no Lord G  Aunt Nell is upon the fret  But she remembers Page  52 her late act of delinquency  so is obliged to be silent  I have her under my thumb   THE man came in after we had dined  I went to him  as if nothing had been the matter between us  You look vexed  my Lord —It was a very violent action  It vexed me at first  But you see how soon I recovered my temper  I wish you would learn patience of me  But come  I forgive you  I will not be angry with you  for an evil that a little money will repair  I see you
