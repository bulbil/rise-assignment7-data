tho  he would grant me nothing  and took me under the arm  and led me in to you  as tho  he had taken me prisoner  The devil has long  continued he  owed me a shame  But who would have thought he had so much power over Sir Charles Grandison  as to get him to pay it me  But  however  I never will be easy till Miss Byron is Lady Pollexfen   I take leave  honoured Sir  to observe  that a few things are noted in this copy  which  to avoid giving offence  will not be in that I shall write for the gentlemen  I was ordered to shew it to Mr  Bagenhall  before you had it  but  for this reason  I shall excuse myself  as having not remembered that command   This  therefore  is a true copy of all that passed  taken to the best of the ability of  Sir  give me leave to subscribe   Your very great admirer  and most humble servant  HENRY COTES   Continuation of Miss BYRON S Letter   WHAT a pacquet  including the short hand writer s paper  transcribed by my cousin Reeves  shall I send you this time  I will not swell it by reflections on that paper  that would be endless  but hasten to give you some account of the visits I mentioned   Sir Hargrave Pollexfen came  without any notice  about nine o  clock     67 My heart sunk  whan his chair stopt at the door  and I was told who was in it   He was shewn into the great parlour  My cousin Reeves s soon attended him  He made great apologies to them  and so Mr  Reeves said he ought  for the disturbance he had given them   He laid all to Love—Prostituted name  made to cover all acts of violence  indiscretion  folly  in both sexes   I was in my own apartment  Mrs  Reeves came up to me  She found me in terror  and went down and told him so  and begged  that he would not insist upon seeing me   The whole intent of this visit  he said  was to beg me to forgive him  It was probable  that I should have the same emotion upon his first visit at any other time  and he entreated the favour of seeing me  He had a right  he said  to see me  He was a sufferer for my sake  They saw  he told them  that he was not the man he had been  and as he had been denied  and been brought to deny himself  the satisfaction due to a gentleman  from a man whom he had never offended  he insisted on having the opportunity given him of seeing me  and receiving my forgiveness  as what would consolidate his reconciliation with Sir Charles Grandison   There was no resisting this plea   And down I trembled  I can hardly say walked   Notwithstanding all my little reasoning with myself  to behave with the dignity of an injured person  yet the moment I saw him approach me  at my entrance into the parlour  I ran to Mr  Reeves  and caught hold of his arm  with looks  I doubt not  of terror  Had Sir Charles Grandison been there  I suppose I should have run to him in the same manner   Ever dear and adorable goodness   were his words  coming to me  how sweet is this terror  and how just    68I have forgiven worse injuries  pointing to his mouth  I meant nothing but honour to you   Honour  Sir  Cruelty  Sir  Barbarity  Sir  How can you wish to see the creature whom you so wickedly treated   I appeal to yourself  Madam  if I offered the least indecency —For all I have suffered by my mad enterprize  what but disgrace—  Disgrace  Sir  was your portion  Sir  half out of breath —What would you  Sir —Why this visit  What am I to do   I hardly knew what I said  and still I held Mr  Reeves s arm   Forgive me  Madam  That is what you are to do  Pardon me  On my knee I beg your pardon  And he dropt down on one knee   Kneel not to me  Sir—Pray do not kneel—You bruised  you hurt  you terrified me  Sir—And  Lord bless me  I was in danger of being your wife  Sir   Was not this last part of my answer a very odd one  But the memory of what I suffered at the time  and of the narrow escape I had  left me not the least presence of mind  on his address to me  kneeling   He arose  In danger of being my wife  Madam  Only that the method I took was wrong  Madam   Miss Byron  you see  is in terror  Sir Hargrave —Sit down  my love  taking my hand  and leading me to the fire side  How you tremble  my dear —You see  Sir Hargrave  the terror my cousin is in—You see—  I do—I do
