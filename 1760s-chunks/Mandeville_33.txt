most emphatical sense of the word  Do you know  I feel extremely inclined to be jealous of her  and am angry with myself for such meanness     A  Wilmot    Tuesday  3d      To Colonel Bellville      SHE is come  this redoubtable Emily Howard  and  I find  I have only a second place in Lady Julia s friendship  I would hate her if I could  but it is really impossible  she is so gentle  she steals one s affection imperceptibly  and one has the          1 169       vexation to be forced to love her in spite of ones self      She has been here three days  and in that short time she has gained amazingly upon my heart  her person is little  finely proportioned  and delicate almost to fragility  her voice and manner soft and timid  her countenance a mixture of innocence and sweetness  which would disarm the rage of a tiger  her heart is tender  kind  compassionate  and tremblingly awake to friendship  of which she is universally the object  Lady Julia doats on her  nor am I surprized at it  she appears so weak  so helpless  so exquisitely feminine  it seems cruelty not to be her friend  no one ever saw her without wishing her happiness  the love one has for her seems of a peculiar species  or most nearly resembles that instinctive fondness one feels for a beautiful child  it is independent of esteem  for one loves her before one knows her  It is          1 170       the pleasantest kind of affection that can be conceived      Yet  though she is extremely handsome  or rather  to suit the expression to her form  extremely pretty  she is very little the taste of men  her excessive modesty renders both her beauty and understanding in some degree useless to her   not obvious  not  obtrusive   she escapes the observation of common eyes  and  tho  infinitely lovely  I never heard she was beloved        For this very reason  the women do her ample justice  she is no woman s rival  stands in nobody s way  which cannot fail of exciting a general good will towards her  in her own sex  they even allow her more beauty than she really has  and take a delight in setting her charms in opposition to every impertinent thing the men are fond of   Yes  the girl is very well  but nothing to Emily Howard   is the          1 171       common cry on the appearance of a new beauty      There is another strong reason for loving her  though exact in her own conduct  she has an indulgence to that of others  which is a consequence of her excessive gentleness of temper  and her seeing every action on the favourable side  one could own one s greatest weakness to her almost without blushing  and at this very moment I dare say Lady Julia is confessing to her her passion for Harry Mandeville  who is riding out with my Lord  I dare say she would find an excuse for my indiscretion in regard to you  and see only the delicacy of our friendship        She sings and dances angelically  but she blushes to death if you tell her so        Such gentle unassuming characters as these  make the most agreeable friends in the world  they are the mild green of the          1 172       soul  on which it rests itself from more glaring objects  one may be absurd  one may be vain  one may be imprudent  secure of being heard with indulgence  I know nothing which would make her more what I mean but her being a fool  however  the indulgent sweetness of her temper answers almost the same purpose      I am disconsolate that the Caro Enrico is going to desert us  but the cruel man is inflexible to all my soft perswasions  and determined to leave us on Wednesday     Adieu      The sweet Emily is gong on Thursday for ten days to Sir George Martin s  and then returns to finish the summer here        Oh  do you know that I am credibly informed  her favorite Suivante having told it to one  who told it to another  who told it to a good old gossiping Lady  who told it          1 173       to me  that the Cittadina  who has in vain wrote Harry a penitential letter  is playing off the same arts  the same dying airs  to Fondville  which had such extreme ill success with him  The siege is at present suspended  not by his addressing Lady Julia  which is a profound secret to her and every body without these walls
