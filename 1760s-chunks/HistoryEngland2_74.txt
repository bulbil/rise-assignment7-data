uncertain  Negotiations had long been carried on to determine these differences  but what could reason do in determining disputes in which there were no certain principles to be guided by  The limits of these countries had never been settled  for they were  before this time  thought too remote  or too insignificant  to employ much attention  And it was not probable that powers who had no other right to the countries in dispute  but that of invasion  would have equity enough to agree upon sharing the spoil   The right which any of the contending powers pretended to  might  in the eye of reason  be thought very controvertible  but the convenience which either party was to derive from the enjoyment of their peculiar claims was not so uncertain  As the dissensions seemed to begin in North America  we must turn to that country to consider their rise  The French had been the first cultivators of Nova Scotia  and  by great industry and long perseverance  rendered the soil  naturally barren  somewhat fertile  and capable of sustaining nature with very little assistance from Europe  This country  however  had frequently changed masters  until the English were acknowledged as the rightful possessors by the treaty of Utrecht  The possession of this country  in any other nation  would expose our colonies to perpetual invasion  and assist them in acquiring a superiority in commerce  and the northern fisheries  It has been already observed  that we had an infant colony upon that coast  which was chiefly supported by royal bounty  and struggled with all the disadvantages of the severe climate    200 and the ungrateful soil  But it had an ob¦struction to its growth still more formidable than either  The French  who had been long settled in the back parts of the country  continually spirited up the Indians to repel the new comers  so that some of them were actually murdered  or sold to the French at Louisburg  These violations were complained of  and complaint produced recrimination  so that the two powers of France and England were negotiating with  accusing  and destroying each other all at one time   Now also began to be observed another source of dispute  which promised as much uneasiness as the former  The French  pretending first to have discovered the mouth of the river Mississippi  claimed the whole adjacent country towards New Mexico on the east  quite to the Apalachian Mountains on the west  And finding several Englishmen  who had settled beyond these mountains  both from motives of commerce  and invited by the natural beauties of the country  they drove them away  and built such forts as could command the whole country around  It was now  therefore  seen  that their intentions were to surround the English colonies which lay along the shore  by taking possession of the internal parts of the country that lay on the back of our settlements  and being already possessed of the northern and southern shores  thus inclose to us on every side  and secure to themselves all trade with the natives of the country  The English therefore justly apprehended  that if the French were able to unite their northern colonies  which were traded into by the river St  Lawrence  to their southern  which were accessible by the river Mississippi  they must  in time  become masters of the whole territory  and  by having a wide country to increase in  would soon multiply  and become every year more dangerous     201 The government of England having long complained of these incroachments  determined  at length  to repel force by force  and to cut the knot of negotiation  which they could not untie  Orders were dispatched to the governors of the provinces to unite into a confederacy for their mutual security  and  if possible  to bring the Indians over to their cause  The Indians were a fierce savage people  unacquainted with the arts  but from infancy trained to the practice of war  It had long been the method of the English to cultivate their friendship in times of danger  but to slight their alliance in circumstances of tranquility  this  in some measure  served to alienate their affections from our government  but the fraud and avarice of our merchants  particularly that called the Ohio company  who sold them bad merchandizes  and treated them with equal insolence and perfidy  served to confirm their aversion  Besides  there was something in the disposition of the French settlers in these regions more similar to theirs  the French  like the natives  were hardy  enterprising  and poor  they naturally therefore joined with those allies  from conquering of whom they could expect no plunder  and declared against the English colonists  who were rich  frugal  and laborious  and whose spoils they consequently were the more desirous to share   Thus then the English had not only the French  but almost the whole body of the Indian nations to oppose  yet this confederacy against them did not give a greater union to the different provinces  whose interest it was to oppose  Some of the provinces  who  from their situation  had little to fear from the enemy  or little advantages to expect from victory  declined furnishing their share of the supplies  the governors of some other colonies  who had been
