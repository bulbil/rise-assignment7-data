and I have talked of every thing  Your uncle will not railly you  as he has done  We still continue resolved not to prescribe to your inclinations  We are afraid therefore of advising you as to this new proposal  But your grandmamma is very much pleased that I have not written as you would have had me  a letter of absolute refusal to the countess   Your uncle has been enquiring into the state of Sir Charles Grandison s affairs  We have heard so many good things of him  that I have desired Mr  Selby to make no further enquiries  unless we could have some hopes of calling him ours  But do you  my dear  nevertheless  omit nothing that comes to your knowledge  that may let us know in him what a good man is  and should be   His magnanimity in refusing to engage in a duel  yet acquitting himself so honourably  as to leave no doubt about his courage  is an example  of itself  of a more than human rectitude of thinking and acting  How would your grandfather have cherished such a young man  We every one of us admire and revere him at the same time  and congratulate you  my dear  and his sisters  on the happy issue of the affair between him and that vile Sir Hargrave     117 You will let me know your mind as to the affair of Lord D   and that by the next post  Be not rash  Be not hasty▪ I am afraid I push d your delicacy too much in my former  Your uncle says  that you are at times not so frank in directly owning your passion  as from your natural openess of heart he expected you would be  when a worthy object had attracted you  And he triumphs over us  in the imagination  that he has at last detected you of affectation in some little degree  We all see  and own  your struggle between virgin modesty and openess of heart  as apparent in many passages of your letters  and we lay part of your reserve to the apprehensions you must have of his raillery  But after you have declared     That you had rather converse but one hour in a week with Sir Charles Grandison    and his sister you put in  And sisters are good convenient people sometimes to a bashful or beginning lover  of our sex    than be the wife of any man you have ever seen or known  and that  mean as the word pity sounds  you would rather have his pity than the love of any other man    —Upon my word  my dear  you need not be backward to speak quite out  Excuse me  my child     I have just now read the inclosed  Had I known your grandmamma could have written so long a letter  I might have spared much of mine  Hers is worthy of her  We all subscribe to it  but yet will be determined by your next  as to the steps to be taken in relation to the proposal of Lady D  But if you love  be not ashamed to own it to us  The man is Sir Charles Grandison   With all our blessings and prayers for you  I bid you  my dear Love  Adieu   MARIANNA SELBY     118  LETTER IX  Mrs  SHIRLEY  To Miss BYRON    Sunday  March 5   DON T be afraid  don t be ashamed  my dearest Life  to open your whole heart to your aunt Selby and me  You know how we all dote upon you  It is no disgrace for a young woman of virtue to be in love with a worthy man  Love is a natural passion  You have shewn  I am sure  if ever young creature did shew  that you are no giddy  no indiscreet person  Not Greville  with all his gaiety  not Fenwick  with all his adulation  not the more respectable Orme  with all his obsequiousness  nor yet the imploring Fowler  nor the terrifying  the shocking Sir Hargrave Pollexfen  have seen the least shadow of vanity or weakness in you  How happily have you steer d thro  difficulties  in which the love of being admired often involves meaner minds  And how have you  with mingled dignity and courteousness  entitled yourself to the esteem  and even veneration  of those whom you refused  And why refused  Not from pride  but principle  and because you could not love any one of them  as you thought you ought to love the man to whom you gave your hand   And at last  when the man appeared to you  who was worthy of your love  who had so powerfully protected you from the lawless attempt of a fierce and cruel pretender  a man who proved to be the best of brothers  friends  landlords  masters  and the bravest and best of men  is it to be wonder d at  that an heart  which never before was won  should discover sensibility  and acknowledge its fellow heart —What reason then can you have for shame  And why seeks my Harriet to draw a curtain between herself and her sympathizing friends  You see
