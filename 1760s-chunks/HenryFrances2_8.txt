never came into such an Agreement  and  if you proposed it  I have forgot it — as I should do every Thing  which betrayed the least Unkindness in you   I shall send this Night to the Post for your Letter  and am impatient to know how you are  I am afraid you spent your Time  careless of your own Health  I may say  of my Health  while Kitty was in Town  I wish a little Scolding Would do you any Good   My dearest Fanny  I do not lessen the Portion of Time allotted by Nature for Rest  I find five Hours sufficient for my Health and Spirits  more Sleep injures both  then rationally I conclude  Nature meant no more  Now every Indulgence we take  beyond what Nature requires  is rather a Fatigue  than a Refreshment  This is equally true in Meat  and Drink  and Sleep  And  to consider it in this Light  the Passage in Lord Grimston s Play  which  along with the whole Performance  has been so laughed at  is not quite so absurd  as it is generally taken    I ll rest my wearied Bones   till they Page  29 more wearied be   I do not think  with you  that a Man is passively good  all the while he is asleep  it would be great Favour to allow him to be even negatively bad  The Mind of Man was framed for a Series of rational Thought  and his Life designed for a Course of moral Actions  if then  without Necessity  he ceases to think  or act  to the best of his Powers  he mars the Ends of his Creation  Nay  I think  we can hardly refrain from charging positive Guilt upon a Person  who sleeps more than he needs  Sleep is a temporary Death  and  as I hinted to you upon this Subject before  how a Man may lengthen his Life  he by this Means shortens it  of course  then  for so much  he is guilty of Suicide  Is not a Man guilty of Theft  who steals from an Heap  because he does not pocket the Whole  And  if a Parcel of Money be laid in a Line upon a Table  is he not equally criminal  who takes from the Middle  as if he stole from one End     I have now gone through both your Letters  and  having nothing better or more agreeable to do  shall return to Pliny  but shall first observe to you  that I have had frequent Thought  since I was upon this Work  of writing Remarks upon your Letters    and hold my Farthing Candle to the Sun   This would be an Undertaking  which would require a great deal  but not too much  Time  for  though your Page  30 Letters are but few  yet the Comments would be many  either to point out the Beauties  or express my Admiration of them     The sixteenth Epistle of the fifth Book is a very fine and a very affecting one  I love Pliny most  when he speaks upon such Subjects as these  His generous Friendships  extreme Tenderness  and extensive Humanity  have given me such an Affection for him  beyond any of the Antients I am acquainted with  that I am resolved he shall be the first Person I will inquire for  when I go to Heaven  for there he is  if St  Paul be there  There may be many greater Characters  I mean with Regard to History  but not one more amiable  How vain then is Ambition  when Pliny is preferred to Alexander  or Caesar  and how surprizing  that Men should still continue in a Mistake  when so little Reflection may set them right   LETTER CXC   Dear FANNY   AS I never read with complete Pleasure  but when we are together  so it gives me Uneasiness  in my Musaeum  when any Sentiment or Criticism occurs to me  that I cannot immediately communicate it to you  And this Page  31 is the Reason  that many of my Letters treat upon Subjects  which seem not proper for such familiar Epistles  as our s generally are  so that  perhaps  some of them appear stiff merely from the Freedom of them  for I never sit down with a Design of writing you a Letter  but  when I take Pen in Hand  I write you whatever occurs to my Mind at that Time  whether Poetry  Metaphysics  Politics  or Divinity   For Instance  now  who could think of entertaining a young Woman of Wit  Gaiety  and poetic Rapture  with a Discourse upon Self Murder  But I happened this Morning to look into a Treatise against Suicide  by Dr  Watts  which I think a very insufficient Performance   Authorities drawn from the Scriptures  or Writings of the Philosophers  may have Effect upon very weak or over religious Minds  But Reasons  not Authorities  are requisite to Men of Sense  or free Reflection  which a Man may have  without being an Atheist  or merely a Deist   In those Places  where the Author attempts to reason  he
