night my tender mamma forsook her own bed  and came to   lie in mine  I saw that she had been afflicted   so  for fear of   adding to her trouble  I suppressed my own emotions  and pre    tended to be asleep  I lay quiet by her side till toward morning    when I was seized with a violent fever  During my illness  I was   told that you came daily to inquire about me   and that  I believe    above all things  contributed to my recovery  One day my mamma   came and informed me that you sat below in tears  and earnestly   requested to be permitted to see me  O how sweet and comforting   did those tears seem to drop upon my heart   but  mustering all   my little pride and remaining dignity No  no  my mamma  I   cried  I will die first   If he does not first unmarry himself  I will   never see him any more    When I had gotten strength enough to walk about the chamber          176 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      my mamma and I being alone  I went to my drawer  and taking   out your picture  and turning my head aside  I reached it to her    saying Here  madam  take this and lock it up from me   for  while   I love it and hate it so much  it troubles me to look at it  My   mamma thereupon took it from me  and catched me to her bosom     but without saying a word  she burst into tears  and straight   quitted the room      As soon as it was judged that I was able to travel  my parents    by the advice of their doctors  took me far into the country  My   mother in the mean time had unquestionably confided my secret to   my father   for  though he was naturally of a severe and backward   temper  he became extremely tender and indulgent toward me      As I was the only child they ever had  their whole care and   solicitude was affectionately employed in procuring me a variety   of gratifications and amusements  When I was in spirits  they   were in a kind of triumph  but my dejection was to them the   most grievous of all oppressions  They took down my French   mistress and music master with them  and they collected from all   parts the most agreeable set of misses and masters that they could   muster  so that my time was portioned put the most happily   that could be  between business and recreations that were equally   pleasing  They had taken care that your name should never be   mentioned before me   and though at times my soul was athirst    and my ear opened and turned to hear tidings concerning you  yet   a certain native bashfulness and fear of offending against decency    did not permit me to inquire after you      Thus a length of absence and a variety of dissipations  by degrees   greatly abated the ardour of my passion  insomuch that I did not   seem to feel any more for you  When any occasion  however  re    newed in me the impression of former scenes  a thrilling sort of   chillness would run through my blood  And at other times  when   alone and thinking of you  a swimming kind of stupor would fall   sadly upon my soul      On our return to London  after five years  absence  the great   number of people  with the novelty and variety of objects that   crowded upon my view  amused and engaged my whole attention    But  when we entered the old mansion when I turned my eyes   on the places where you sat  where you walked  where you talked   and used to caress me you became as it were actually visible to   my eyes   something seemed to wring my heart   and I was seized   with a sickness near to fainting  I took hold of my maid by the   arm  and with her help walked into the garden for fresh air   but   there too you had got before me  On the terrace  in the walks and   alleys  where you used to run feigned races with me  and to gather   fruit for me  and to play with me at bob cherry  and afterwards to   press the lips that had gained the prize  I then turned away from   a place that afforded me no asylum from you  My mother met  and   eagerly asked what ailed me   Let us go  mamma  I cried   let us   go somewhere else  I am not able to stay in this place any longer
