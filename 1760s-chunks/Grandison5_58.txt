blotting out  and revising and transcribing  and which yet I drew up with an intent to shew thee  I verily think I cannot  Nor will I  till I can see  by conversing with thee face to face  what I shall be enabled to do  in answer to prayers to Heaven  that it would enable me —O how faint  at times  have been those prayers   You  my Father  my Mother  my Brothers  and you my spiritual Father  pious and good man  have helped to subdue me  by your generous goodness  You have all yielded up your own judgments to mine  You have told me  that if the choice of my heart can make me happy  happy I shall be  But do I not know  that you have complied with me  for my sake only —Shall I not  if it please God to restore my memory  be continually recollecting the arguments which you  Father Marescotti  in particular  formerly urged against an alliance with this noblest of men  because he was of a religion so contrary to my own  and so pertinacious in it  And will those recollections make me happy  O permit  permit me  my dearest friends  still to be God s child  the spouse of my Redeemer only  Let me  let me yet take the veil — Page  145 And let me  in a place consecrated to his glory  pass the remainder of my life  It may not be a long one  in prayers for you all  and in prayers for the conversion and happiness of the man  whose soul my soul loveth  and ever must love  What is the portion of this world  which my grandfathers have bequeathed to me  weighed against this motive  and my soul s everlasting welfare  Let me take a great revenge of my cruel cousin Laurana  Let hers be the estate so truly despised  and so voluntarily forfeited  by the happier Clementina —Are we not all of us rich and noble  Shall I not have a great revenge  if I can be enabled to take it in this way   O thou whom my soul loveth  let me try the greatness of thy love  and the greatness of thy soul  by thy endeavours to strengthen  and not impair  a resolution  which  after all  it will be in thy power to make me break or keep  For God only knoweth what this struggle from the first hath cost me  and what it will still further cost me  But  my brain wounded  my health impaired  can I expect a long life  And shall I not endeavour to make the close of it happy  Let me be great  my Chevalier  how fondly can I nevertheless call thee my Chevalier  Thou cast make the unhappy Clemantina what thou pleasest   But  O my friends  what can we do for this great and good man  in return for the obligations he hath heaped upon us all  In return for his goodness to two of your children  These obligations lie heavy upon my heart  Yet who knows not his magnanimity  Who  that knows him  knows not that he can enjoy the reward in the action  Divine  almost divine  Philanthropist  canst thou forgive me —But I know thou canst  Thou hast the same notions that I have of the brevity and vanity of this world s glory  and of the duration of that to come  And can I have the presumption to imagine  that the giving thee in marriage Page  146 so wounded a frame  would be making thee happy  Once more  if I have the courage  the resolution  to shew thee this paper  do thou enable me  by thy great example  to complete the conquest of myself  and do not put me upon taking advantage of my honoured friends generosity  But do God and thou enable me to say  Not my will  but his and theirs  be done —Yet  after all  it must be  let me own  in thy choice  for I cannot bear to be thought ungrateful to such exalted merit  to add what name thou pleasest  to that of  CLEMENTINA—  Never was man more astonished  perplexed  confounded  For a few moments  I forgot that the angel was in her closet  expecting the issue of my contemplations  and walking out of her dressing room  I threw myself on a soffa  in the next room  not heeding Camilla  who sat in the window  My mind tortured  how greatly tortured  Yet filled with admiration of the angelic qualities of Clementina  I tried to look again into the paper  but the contents were all in my mind  and filled it   She rang  Camilla hastened to her  I started as she passed me  I arose  yet trembled  And for a moment sat down to re assure my feet  But Camilla  coming to me  roused me out of the stupidity that had seized me  Never was I so little present to myself  as on this occasion—A woman so superior to all her own Sex  and to all that I had read of  of ours —O Sir  said Camilla  my Lady dreads your anger
