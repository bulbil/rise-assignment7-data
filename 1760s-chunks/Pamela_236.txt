 O dearest  dear sir  said I  have you nothing more to honour me with    You oblige and improve me at the same time   What a happy lot is mine       Why  let me see  my dearest  said he  But I think of no more at present    For it would be needless to say how much I value you for your natural   sweetness of temper  and that open cheerfulness of countenance  which   adorns you  when nothing has given my fairest apprehensions for her   virtue  A sweetness  and a cheerfulness  that prepossesses in your   favour  at first sight  the mind of every one that beholds you   I need   not  I hope  say  that I would have you diligently preserve this sweet   appearance  Let no thwarting accident  no cross fortune   for we must   not expect to be exempt from such  happy as we now are in each other     deprive this sweet face of this its principal grace  And when any thing   unpleasing happens  in a quarter of an hour  at farthest  begin to   mistrust yourself  and apply to your glass  and if you see a gloom   arising  or arisen  banish it instantly  smooth your dear countenance    resume your former composure  and then  my dearest  whose heart must   always be seen in her face  and cannot be a hypocrite  will find this a   means to smooth her passions also  And if the occasion be too strong for   so sudden a conquest  she will know how to do it more effectually  by   repairing to her closet  and begging that gracious assistance  which has   never yet failed her  And so shall I  my dear  who  as you once but too   justly observed  have been too much indulged by my good mother  have   an example from you  as well as a pleasure in you  which will never be   palled       One thing  continued he  I have frequently observed at the house of many   a gentleman  That when we have unexpectedly visited  or broken in upon   the family order laid down by the lady  and especially if any of us   have lain under the suspicion of having occasionally seduced our married   companion into bad hours  or given indifferent examples  the poor   gentleman has been oddly affected at our coming  though the good   breeding of the lady has made her just keep up appearances  He has   looked so conscious  has been so afraid  as it were  to disoblige  has   made so many excuses for some of us  before we had been accused  as have   always shewn me how unwelcome we have been  and how much he is obliged   to compound with his lady for a tolerable reception of us  and  perhaps    she too  in proportion to the honest man s concern to court her smiles    has been more reserved  stiff  and formal  and has behaved with an   indifference and slight that has often made me wish myself out of her   house  for too plainly have I seen that it was not his       This  my dear  you will judge  by my description  has afforded me   subject for animadversion upon the married life  for a man may not    though  in the main  he is willing to flatter himself that he is master   of his house  and will assert his prerogative upon great occasions  when   it is strongly invaded  be always willing to contend  and such women   as those I have described  are always ready to take the field  and are   worse enemies than the old Parthians  who annoy most when they seem to   retreat  and never fail to return to the charge again  and carry on the   offensive war  till they have tired out resistance  and made the husband   willing  like a vanquished enemy  to compound for small matters  in   order to preserve something  At least the poor man does not care to let   his friends see his case  and so will not provoke a fire to break out    that he sees  and so do his friends too  the meek lady has much ado to   smother  and which  very possibly  burns with a most comfortable ardour    after we are gone       You smile  my Pamela  said he  at this whimsical picture  and  I am   sure  I never shall have reason to include you in these disagreeable   outlines  but yet I will say  that I expect from you  whoever comes to   my house  that you accustom yourself to one even  uniform complaisance    That no frown take place on your brow  That however ill or
