Tis time for both to have done   Sir Charles enter d  Mr  Grandison a sufferer again  said he   Mr  Gr  No  no  Pretty well off this bout —Miss Byron  I have had the better end of the staff  I believe   Harriet  I can t say that  Sir  But you got off  I believe  in very good time   Mr  Gr  And that s a victory  to what it used to be  I can assure you  Nobody ever could awe Miss Grandison   Miss Gr  Coward —You would now begin again  would you —Sir Charles loves to take me down   Mr  Gr  Never  madam  but when you are up  And laugh d heartily   Miss Gr  Witty too —A man of repartee  A   114verbal wit  And that s half as good as a punster  at any time   Sir Ch  Fight it out  cousin Grandison  You can laugh on  tho  the laugh of every other person should be against you   Mr  Gr  And thou  Brutus —It is time to have done   As I think these conversations characteristic  I hope the recital of them will be excused  Yet I am sensible  those things that go off well in conversation  do not always read to equal advantage   They would fain have engaged us to stay to supper  But we excused ourselves  I promised to breakfast with them   I chose not to take my maid with me  Jenny is to be made over to me occasionally  for the time of my stay  Dr  Bartlett had desired to be excused  So our party is only the two Sisters  Lord L  Miss Jervois  and I   Sir Charles and Mr  Grandison are to set out for their journey early in the morning   Adieu  my Lucy  It is late  And sleepiness promises to befriend  Your HARRIET   LETTER VIII  Mrs  SELBY  To Miss BYRON a    Selby house Sunday Mar  5   My dearest Child   WE are all extremely affected with your present situation  Such apparent struggles betwixt your natural openness of heart  and the confessions of a young    115 of a new passion  and that so laudably founded  and so visibly increasing—O my Love  you must not affect reserves  They will sit very aukwardly upon a young woman  who never knew what affectation and concealment were   You have laid me under a difficulty with respect to Lady D  She is to be with me on Saturday next  I I have not written to her  tho  you desired I would  since  in truth  we all think  that her proposals deserve consideration  and because we are afraid  that a greater happiness will never be yours and ours  It is impossible  my dear  to imagine  that such a man as Sir Charles Grandison should not have seen the woman whom he could love  before he saw you  or whom he had not been engaged to love by his gratitude  as I may call it  for her Love  Has not his sister talk d of half a score Ladies  who would break their hearts for him  were he to marry —And may not this be the reason why he does not   You see what an amiable openness of heart there is in the countess of D  You see  that your own frankness is a particular recommendation of you to her  I had told her  that you were disengaged in your affections  By your own disclaiming to her the proposed relation  you have given reason to so wise a Lady to think it otherwise  or that you are not so much above affectation  as she had hoped you were  And tho  we were grieved to read how much you were pushed by Miss Grandison a  yet Lady D  will undoubtedly make the same observations and inferences  that Miss Grandison did  And what would you have me do  since you cannot give a stronger instance of your affections being engaged  than by declining such a proposal as Lady D  made  before you have conversed with  or even seen Lord D  And it becomes not your character nor mine  either to equivocate  or to say the thing that is not     116 Lady L  you think  and indeed so it appears  hinted to Lady D  that Sir Charles stands not in the way of Lord D  s application  I see not therefore  that there can be any room to hope from that quarter  Nor will your fortune  I doubt  be thought considerable enough  And as Sir Charles is not engaged by affection  and is generous and munificent  there is hardly room to imagine  but that  in prudence  fortune will have some weight with him  At least  on our side  that ought to be supposed  and to make a part of our first proposals  were a treaty to be begun   Your grandmamma will write to you with her own hand  I refer myself wholly to her  Her wisdom  and her tenderness for you  we all know  She
