you are  I hope you will act up to your conviction   Was this necessary to be said to me  I think  on recollection  she half smiled when she said it   My dear Dr  Bartlett  you see Clementina could be pleasant on an occasion so solemn —But perhaps she saw me only affectedly chearful  Little  at present  as she imagines it  I think it not impossible that she may in time be brought to yield to the sense of her duty  laid down by such powerful advocates as she has in her own family  Whatever happens  may it be happy to her and this family  and then I cannot be wholly joyless  What is there in this Life  worth—But let me not be too abstracted  This world  if we can enjoy it with innocent chearfulness  and be serviceable to our fellow creatures  is not to be despised  even by a Philosopher   Page  230 I hope  madam  said I  to her  that at least you suspend your wishes after the sequestred life  She allowed the force of one or two of my arguments  but I could perceive  that she gave not up her hope of being complied with in her wishes to assume the veil   The General  and his Lady  and the Count  being come in  hastened up to pay their compliments to me  How profuse were the two Gentlemen in theirs   At the Marchioness s motion  we went to Jeronymo  and found the Marquis  the Bishop  and Father Marescotti  coming to us  And then  every one joining in their acknowlegements of obligation to me  and wishing it in their power to make me as happy as they declared I had made them  I said  It was in their power  I hoped  to do me an unspeakable pleasure   They called upon me  as with one voice  It is  answered I  that my dear friend Jeronymo may be prevailed upon to accompany me to England  Mr  Lowther would think himself very happy in his attendance on him there  rather than to stay here  and yet  if my request should not be granted  he is determined not to leave him till he is supposed to be out of danger   They looked upon one another with eyes of pleasure and surprize  Jeronymo wept  I cannot  cannot bear  said he  such a weight of obligation  Grandison  we can do nothing for you  And you have brought me your Lowther to heal me  that you might have the killing of me yourself   Clementina s eyes were filled with tears  She went from us with some little precipitation   O Chevalier  said the Marchioness  my Clementina s heart is too susceptible for its own ease  to impressions of gratitude  You will quite kill the poor child—or make her repent her resolution   What is there but favour to me  replied I  if my Page  231 request can be complied with  I hope my dear Jeronymo will not be unattended by others of his friends  I have had the promises of the two young Lords  Our baths are restorative  I will attend you to them  my dear Jeronymo  The difference of air  of climate  may  probably  be tried with advantage  Let me have the honour of entertaining you in England  looking all round me  and that I will consider  as a full return of the obligations you think so highly of  and are so solicitous to discharge   They looked upon one another  in silence   Would to God  proceeded I  that you  my Lord  and you  madam  directing myself to the father and mother  would honour me  as my guests  for one season—You once had thoughts of it  had a certain happy event taken place—I dare promise you both  after the fatigues you have undergone  a renewal of health  from our salutary springs  I should be but too happy  if  in such company  a sister might be allowed to visit a brother —But if this be thought too great a favour  that sister  in your absence  cannot but give and receive pleasure  sometimes in visiting Mrs  Beaumont at Florence  sometimes her Brother and his Lady at Naples  And I will engage my two Sisters and their Lords to accompany me in my attendance on you back to Bologna  My Sisters will be delighted with the opportunity of visiting Italy  and of paying their respects to a young Lady whose character they revere  and to whom once their brother had hoped to give them the honour of a relation   They still continuing silent  but none of them seeming displeased  You will  by such a favour  my dear Lords  and you  madam  to the Marchioness  do me credit with myself  as I may say  I shall return to my native country  if I go alone  after the hopes you had all given me  like a disappointed and rejected man  My pride  as well as my pleasure  is concerned on this occasion  My house in the country  my house Page  232 in London  shall be yours  I will be either inmate or visiter  at
