secret which you must learn from no lips but her own  Follow me  I will show you into her chamber  With these words the duenna took me by the hand  and led me mysteriously into her lady s apartment through a little door  of which she had the key       CH  II     Aurora s reception of Gil Blas  Their conversation   I FOUND Aurora in an undress  I saluted her in the most respectful manner  and threw as much elegance into my attitude as I had to throw  She received me with the most winning affability  made me sit down by her against all my remonstrances  and told her ambassadress to go into another room  After this opening  which seemed highly encouraging to my cause  she entered upon the business  Gil Blas  said she  you must have perceived how favourably I have regarded and distinguished you from all the rest of my father s servants  and though my looks had not betrayed my partial dispositions towards you  my proceeding of this night would leave you no room to doubt them   I did not give her time to say a word more  It struck me  that as a man of feeling  I ought to spare her trembling diffidence the cruel necessity of explaining her sentiments in more direct terms  I rose from my chair in a transport  and  throwing myself at Aurora s feet  like a tragedy hero of the Grecian stage when he supplicates the heroine  by her knees   exclaimed in a declamatory tone    Ah  Madam  could it be possible that Gil Blas  hitherto the whirligig of fortune and football of embattled nature  should have called down upon his head the exquisite felicity of inspiring sentiments Do not speak so loud  interrupted my mistress with a laugh of mingled apprehension and ridicule  you will wake my women who sleep in the adjoining chamber  Get up  take your seat  and hear me out without putting in a word  Yes  Gil Blas  pursued she  resuming her gravity  you have my best wishes  and to shew you how deep you are in my good graces  I will confide to you a secret on which depends the repose of my life  I am in love with a young gentleman  possessing every charm of person and face  and noble by birth  His name is Don Lewis Pacheco  I have seen him occasionally in the public walks and at the theatre  but I have never conversed with him  I do not even know what his private character may be  or what bad qualities he may have  It is on this subject that I wish to be informed  I stand in need of a person to inquire diligently into his morals  and give me a true and particular account  I make choice of you  Surely I run no risk in entrusting you with this commission  I hope that you will acquit yourself with dexterity and prudence  and that I shall never repent of giving you my confidence   My mistress concluded thus  and waited for my answer to her proposal  I had been disconcerted in the first instance at so disagreeable a mistake  but I soon recovered my scattered senses  and surmounting the confusion which rashness always occasions when it is unlucky  I exposed to sale such a cargo of zeal  For the lady s interests  I devoted myself with so martyr like an enthusiasm to her service  that if she did not absolutely forget my silly vanity in the thought of having pleased her  at least she had reason to believe that I knew how to make amends for a piece of folly  I asked only two days to bring her a satisfactory account of Don Lewis  After which Dame Ortiz  answering the bell  shewed me the way back into the garden  and said  on taking leave  Good night  Gil Blas  I need not caution you to be in time at the next appointment  I have sufficient experience of your punctuality on these occasions   I returned to my chamber  not without some little mortification at finding my voluptuous anticipations all divested of even their ideal sweetness  I was nevertheless sufficiently in my senses to reflect soberly that it was more in my element to be the trusty scout of my mistress than her lover  I even thought that this adventure might lead to something further  that the middle men in the trade of love usually pocket a tolerable percentage  and went to bed with the resolution of doing whatever Aurora required of me  For this purpose I went abroad the next morning  The residence of so distinguished a personage as Don Lewis was not difficult to find out  I made my enquiries about him in the neighbourhood  but the people who came in my way could not satisfy my curiosity to the full  so that it was necessary to resume my search diligently on the following day  I was in better luck  I met a lad of my acquaintance by chance in the street  we stopped for a little gossip  There passed by in the very nick one of his friends  who came up and told him that he was just turned away from the family of Don Joseph Pacheco  Don Lewis s father  about a paltry remnant of wine
