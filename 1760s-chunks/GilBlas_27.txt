will bear witness to his qualifications  The connoisseurs were all of opinion that this commission suited my talents to a hair  and exhorted me to do my best Gentlemen  quoth I  you shall have no reason to complain  I will strip this holy father to his birth day suit  and give you complete right and title to his mule  No  no  said Rolando  the beast would not be worth its fodder  only bring us our reverend pastor s purse  that is all we require  Hereupon I issued from the wood and pushed up to the man of God  doing penance all the time in my own breast for the sin I was committing  I could have liked to have turned my back upon my fellows at that moment  but most of them had the advantage of better horses than mine  had they seen me making off they would have been at my heels  and would soon have caught me  or perhaps would have fired a volley  for which I was not sufficiently case  hardened  I could not therefore venture on so perilous an alternative  so that claiming acquaintance with the reverend father  I asked to look at his purse  and just put out the end of a pistol  He stopped short to gaze upon me  and  without seeming much frightened  said  My child  you are very young  this is an early apprenticeship to a bad trade  Father  replied I  bad as it is  I wish I had begun it sooner  What  my son  rejoined the good friar  who did not understand the real meaning of what I said  how say you  What blindness  give me leave to place before your eyes the unhappy condition  Come  come  father  interrupted I  with impatience  a truce to your morality  if you please  My business on the high road is not to hear sermons  Money makes my mare to go  Money said he  with a look of surprise  you have a poor opinion of Spanish charity  if you think that people of my stamp have any occasion for such trash upon their travels  Let me undeceive you  We are made welcome wherever we go  and pay for our board and lodgings by our prayers  In short  we carry no cash with us on the road  but draw drafts upon Providence  That is all very well  replied I  yet for fear your drafts should be dishonoured  you take care to keep about you a little supply for present need  But come  father  let us make an end  my comrades in the wood are in a hurry  so your money or your life  At these words  which I pronounced with a determined air  the friar began to think the business grew serious  Since needs must  said he  there is wherewithal to satisfy your craving  A word and a blow is the only rhetoric with you gentlemen  As he said this  be drew a large leathern purse from under his gown  and threw it on the ground  I then told him he might make the best of his way  and he did not wait for a second bidding  but stuck his heels into the mule  which  giving the lie to my opinion  for I thought it on a par with my uncle s  set off at a good round pace  While he was riding for his life  I dismounted  The purse was none of the lightest  I mounted again  and got back to the wood  where those nice  observers were waiting with impatience to congratulate me on my success  I could hardly get my foot out of the stirrup  so eager were they to shake hands with me  Courage  Gil Blas  said Rolando  you have done wonders  I have had my eyes on you during your whole performance  and have watched your countenance  I have no hesitation in predicting that you will become in time a very accomplished highwayman  The lieutenant and the rest chimed in with the prophecy  and assured me that I could not fail of fulfilling it hereafter  I thanked them for the elevated idea they had formed of my talents  and promised to do all in my power not to discredit their penetration   After they had lavished praises  the effect rather of their candour than of my merit  they took it into their heads to examine the booty I had brought under my convoy  Let us see  said they  let us see how a friar s purse is lined  It should be fat and flourishing  continued one of them  for these good fathers do not mortify the flesh when they travel  The captain untied the purse  opened it  and took out two or three handfuls of little copper coins  an Agnus Dei here and there  and some scapularies  At sight of so novel a prize  all the privates burst into an immoderate fit of laughter  God be praised  cried the lieutenant  we are very much obliged to Gil Blas  his first attack has produced a supply  very seasonable to our fraternity  One joke brought on another  These rascals  especially the fellow who had retired from the church to our subterraneous hermitage  began to make themselves merry on the subject
