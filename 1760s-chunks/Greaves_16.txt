regulated the diversions of the theatre    But to return from this digression  Sir Everhard Greaves did not seem to be very well pleased with the conduct of his son at London  He got notice of some irregularities and scrapes into which he had fallen  and the squire seldom wrote to his father  except to draw upon him for money  which he did so fast  that in eighteen months the old gentleman lost all patience    At this period Squire Darnel chanced to die  leaving an only daughter  a minor  heiress of three thousand a year under the guardianship of her uncle Anthony  whose brutal character all the world knows  The breath was no sooner out of his brother s body  than he resolved  if possible  to succeed him in parliament as representative for the borough of Ashenton  Now you must know  that this borough had been for many years a bone of contention between the families of Greaves and Darnel  and at length the difference was compromised by the interposition of friends  on condition that Sir Everhard and Squire Darnel should alternately represent the place in parliament  They agreed to this compromise for their mutual convenience  but they were never heartily reconciled  Their political principles did not tally  and their wives looked upon each other as rivals in fortune and magnificence  So that there was no intercourse between them  thof they lived in the same neighbourhood  On the contrary  in all disputes  they constantly headed the opposite parties  Sir Everhard understanding that Anthony Darnel had begun to canvass  and was putting every iron in the fire  in violation and contempt of the pactum familiae before mentioned  fell into a violent passion  that brought on a severe fit of the gout  by which he was disabled from giving personal attention to his own interest  My father  indeed  employed all his diligence and address  and spared neither money  time  nor constitution  till at length he drank himself into a consumption  which was the death of him  But  after all  there is a great difference between a steward and a principal  Mr  Darnel attended in propria persona  flattered and caressed the women  feasted the electors  hired mobs  made processions  and scattered about his money in such a manner  that our friends durst hardly show their heads in public    At this very crisis  our young squire  to whom his father had written an account of the transaction  arrived unexpectedly at Greavesbury Hall  and had a long private conference with Sir Everhard  The news of his return spread like wildfire through all that part of the country  Bonfires were made  and the bells set a ringing in several towns and steeples  and next morning above seven hundred people were assembled at the gate  with music  flags  and streamers  to welcome their young squire  and accompany him to the borough of Ashenton  He set out on foot with his retinue  and entered one end of the town just as Mr  Darnel s mob had come in at the other  Both arrived about the same time at the market place  but Mr  Darnel  mounting first into the balcony of the town house  made a long speech to the people in favour of his own pretensions  not without some invidious reflections glanced at Sir Everhard  his competitor    We did not much mind the acclamations of his party  which we knew had been hired for the purpose  but we were in some pain for Mr  Greaves  who had not been used to speak in public  He took his turn  however  in the balcony  and  uncovering his head  bowed all round with the most engaging courtesy  He was dressed in a green frock  trimmed with gold  and his own dark hair flowed about his ears in natural curls  while his face was overspread with a blush  that improved the glow of youth to a deeper crimson  and I daresay set many a female heart a palpitating  When he made his first appearance  there was just such a humming and clapping of hands as you may have heard when the celebrated Garrick comes upon the stage in King Lear  or King Richard  or any other top character  But how agreeably were we disappointed  when our young gentleman made such an oration as would not have disgraced a Pitt  an Egmont  or a Murray  while he spoke  all was hushed in admiration and attention  you could have almost heard a feather drop to the ground  It would have charmed you to hear with what modesty he recounted the services which his father and grandfather had done to the corporation  with what eloquence he expatiated upon the shameful infraction of the treaty subsisting between the two families  and with what keen and spirited strokes of satire he retorted the sarcasms of Darnel    He no sooner concluded his harangue  than there was such a burst of applause  as seemed to rend the very sky  Our music immediately struck up  our people advanced with their ensigns  and  as every man had a good cudgel  broken heads would have ensued  had not Mr  Darnel and his party thought proper to retreat with uncommon despatch  He never offered to make another public entrance  as he saw the
