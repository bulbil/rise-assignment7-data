table with several noblemen and the poet Nunez  who called about him as if perfectly at home  and took a principal share in the conversation  Indeed  he never opened his lips without applause  So much for wit  with that commodity at market  a man may pay his way in any company   It was my lot to dine with the gentlemen of the household  who were served nearly as well as their employer  After meal time I withdrew to ruminate on my lot  So far so good  Gil Blas  said I to myself  here you are in the family of a Sicilian count  of whose character you know nothing  To judge by appearances  you will be as much in your element as a duck upon the water  But do not make too sure  you ought to look askew at your horoscope  whose unkindly position you have too often experienced with a vengeance  Independent of that  it is not easy to conjecture what he means you to do  There are secretaries and a steward already  where can your post be  In all likelihood you are intended to manage his little private affairs  Well and good  There is no better luck about the house of a great nobleman  if you would travel post haste to make your fortune  In the performance of more honourable services  a man gets on only step by step  and even at that pace often sticks by the way   While these philosophical reflections were revolving in my mind  a servant came to tell me that all the company was gone home  and that my lord the count was inquiring for me  I flew immediately to his apartment  where I found him lolling on the sofa  ready to take his afternoon s nap  with his monkey by his side   Come nearer  Gil Blas  said he  take a chair  and hear me attentively  I placed myself in an attitude of profound listening  when he addressed me as follows  Don Fabricio has informed me that  among other good qualities  you have that of sincere attachment to your masters  and incorruptible integrity  These are my inducements for proposing to take you into my service  I stand in need of a friend in a domestic  to espouse my interests and apply his whole heart and soul to the reform of my establishment  My fortune is large  it must be confessed  but my expenditure far exceeds my income every year  And how happens that  Because they rob  ransack  and devour me  I might as well be in a forest infested by banditti  as an inhabitant of my own house  I suspect the clerk of the kitchen and my steward of playing into one another s hands  and unless my thoughts are unjust as well as uncharitable  they are pushing forward as fast as they can to ruin me beyond redemption  You will ask me what I have to do but send them packing  if I think them scoundrels  But then where are others to be got of a better breed  It will be sufficient to place them under the eye of a man who shall be invested with the right of control over their conduct  and you have I chosen to execute this commission  If you discharge it well  be assured that your services will not be repaid with ingratitude  I shall take care to provide you with a very comfortable settlement in Sicily   With this he dismissed me  and that very evening  in the presence of the whole household  I was proclaimed principal manager and surveyor general of the family  Our gentlemen of Messina and Naples expressed no particular chagrin at first  because they considered me as a spark of mettle like their own  and took it for granted  that though the loaf was to be shared with a third  there would always be cut and come again for the triumvirate  But they looked inexpressibly foolish the next day  when I declared myself in serious terms a decided enemy to all peculation and underhand dealing  From the clerk of the kitchen I required the buttery accounts without varnish or concealment  I went down into the cellar  The furniture of the butler s pantry underwent a strict examination  particularly in the articles of plate and linen  Next I read them a serious lecture on the duty of acting for their employer as they would for themselves  exhorted them to adopt a system of economy in their expenditure  and wound up my harangue with a protestation  that his lordship should be acquainted with the very first instance of any unfair tricks that I should discover in the exercise of my office   But I had not yet got to the length of my tether  There was still wanting a scout to ascertain whether they had any private understanding  I fixed upon a scullion  who  won over by my promises  told me that I could not have applied to a better person to be informed of all that was passing in the family  that the clerk of the kitchen and the steward were one as good as the other  and agreed to burn the candle at both ends  that half the provisions bought for the table were made perquisites by these gentlemen  that the Neapolitan kept a lady who lives opposite St  Thomas s college  and his colleague  not
