more flush  he helped me off with my dinner and lightened my bottle almost without asking   One day  after four or five glasses  when his stomach had renewed its intimacy with a more generous system of feeding  he said to me with an air of gaiety  Upon my word  Signor Gil Blas  you have very winning ways with you  you make me do just whatever you please  There is something so hearty in your welcome as to relieve me from all fear of trespassing on your generous temper  My captain seemed at that moment so entirely to have got rid of his bashfulness  that if I had been in the humour to have seized the lucky moment  and to have pressed my purse once more on his acceptance  I am much mistaken if he would have refused it  I did not put him to the trial  but rested satisfied with having made him my messmate  and taken the trouble not only to copy out his memorials  but to assist him in their composition  By dint of having written homilies out fair  I had learnt the knack of phraseology  and was become a sort of author  The old officer on his side had some little vanity about writing well  Both of us thus contending for the prize  the bursts of eloquence would have done honour to the most celebrated professors of Salamanca  But it was in vain that we sat on opposite sides of the table  and drained our genius to the very dregs  to nourish the flowers of rhetoric in these memorials  you might as well have planted an orange grove on the sea beach  In whatever new light we placed Don Annibal s services  it was all the same at court  the connoisseurs were decided about their merit  so that the battered veteran had no reason to sing the praises of that spirit which leads officers on to spend their family estates in the service  In the virulence of his spleen he cursed the planet under which he was born  and sent Naples  Lombardy  and the Low Countries to the devil   That his mortification might be pressed down and running over  it happened to his face one day that a poet  introduced by the Duke of Alva  having recited a sonnet before the king on the birth of an infant  was gratified with a pension of five hundred ducats  I believe the lop limbed captain would have gone raving mad at it  if I had not taken some pains to recompense his spirit  What is the matter with you  said I  seeing him quite beside himself  There is nothing in all this which ought to go so terribly agaiust the grain  Ever since Mount Parnassus swelled above the subject plain  have not poets pleaded the privilege of laying princes under contribution to their muse  There is not a crowned head in Christendom that has not substituted a pensioned laureate for the household fool of less refined times  And between ourselves  this species of patronage  for the most part galloping down full drive to posterity on the saddle of Pegasus  raises a hue and cry in honour of royal munificence  but bounty to persons who are lost in a crowd  however deserving  adds nothing to the bulk or stature of posthumous renown  Augustus must have drained his treasury by gratuities  and yet how few of the names on his pension list have come down to us  But distant ages shall be informed  as we are  in all the hyperbole of poetic diction  that his benefits descended on Virgil like the rain from heaven  whose drops arithmetic has no combinations to count  no principles by which to reason on their number   But let me talk ever so classically to Don Annibal  there was a confounded acidity in that sonnet which curdled all the milky ingredients of his moral composition  it was impossible to chew  swallow  and digest such food with human organs  and he was fully determined to give the matter up at once  It seemed right  nevertheless  by way of playing for his last stake  to present one more memorial to the Duke of Lerma  and if that failed there was an end of the game  For this purpose we went together to the prime minister s  There we met a young man who  after saluting the captain  said to him in a tone of affection  My old and dear master  is it your own self that I see  What business brings you to this mart of favour  If you have occasion for any one to speak a good word for you  do not spare my lungs  they are entirely at your service  How is this  Pedrillo  answered the officer  to hear you talk it should seem as if you held some important post in this house  At least  replied the young man  I have influence enough here to put an honest rustic like you into the right train  That being the case  resumed the captain with a smile  I place myself under your protection  I accept the pledge  rejoined Pedrillo  You have only to acquaint me with your particular taste  and I engage to give you a savoury slice out of the ministerial pasty   We had no sooner opened our minds to this young fellow  so full of kind assurances  than he
