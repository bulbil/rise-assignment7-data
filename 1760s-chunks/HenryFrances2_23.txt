knavish Prank lately  with Regard to me  Tom can inform you  But I shall not expose him  for two extraordinary Reasons  because I do not believe any other Man would decline it  and because I have a sincere Picque to him  upon an Occasion  I mentioned to you  some Time ago   Adieu   my Heart s Transport   Henry   LETTER CCXI   Dear HARRY   THOUGH I make no Doubt but your good Sense and Philosophy will prevent your being uneasy  from the Account you received of my Illness  yet I think it my Duty to inform you  that I am better  than when you heard last I believe few People ever suffered more  in the Time  than I did from Tuesday Noon  to the same Hour on Wednesday  But I make no Account of all I have endured  since it has pleased the Almighty to spare the dear Page  86 Life  which I am infinitely more anxious for  than my own  I hope still to preserve it  and am determined rather to sacrifice myself than it  I have four of your Letters before me  but cannot pretend to answer any of them  I write in Bed  and can hardly see   You say I talk of dying in a splenetic Way  You are mistaken  Harry  Death has as few Terrors for me  as for most People  I talked of his Approach  as a Thing expected  but not feared  If I betrayed any Weakness  it must have been from the Thoughts of parting with you  not Life  for indeed I have as little Reason to be fond of a painful Existence  as you have to be  displeased and disobliged   at my being concerned for our present or future Separation  I am of Opinion  that it is Strength of Body  not Mind  I want  to render me agreeable to you  If I were a Foot taller  and proportionably robust  I should be a cleverer Person than I am  but since   we cannot  by taking Thought  add one Cubit to our Stature   it is in vain to complain of my small Size  or Want of Strength or Spirits     I shall not mention your Coming any more  I have already spoke my Sentiments  Your own Discretion be your Guide   Adieu  my dear Stoic  May I  if I live  be able to acquire the Strength  you wish me possessed of  or may you  in some Degree  become Page  87 more indulgent  as better used to my Weakness and Deficiencies  both of Mind and Body   LETTER CCXII  FRANCES to HENRY   I SEND you Mr  Lyttelton s Monody  which I am charmed with  though I think there appears more Poetry than Love in it  Not that the Grief is not well  but that it is too well expressed  which a Person who really felt could not  perhaps  so aptly describe  And methinks I perceive more of the Poet s Art  than of the Mourner s Sorrow   If  indeed  he be truly sincere  I declare  that I would rather have Mr  Lyttelton my Widower  than be the Wife of any other Man in the World  except yourself  For then I should have had the highest Happiness this World can boast of  the being beloved and esteemed by a Man of Sense  Taste  and Virtue  the Merit of which must insure the Happiness of the next  which  if higher than that  rises above the Power of human Wish to desire  or of human Wit to conceive   There is one Criterion of Mr  Lyttelton s Sincerity  which I have established in my own Page  88 Mind  and that is his marrying  or not marrying again   Adieu   LETTER CCXIII   YOU tell me  that your Picture is improved into your own Likeness at last  then take it home immediately  lest the Painter should attempt to cheat me with a Helen of Guido s   Poetry and Painting  they say  are Sister Arts  but Hudson has so raised my Jealousy by his Success  that I shall endeavour to make them Rivals too   Character of FANNY   With all of Wit that Nature can bestow   And more of Sense  than ev n her Sense can know   Her Heart a Mine  by Modesty conceal d   Untaught to glow   till Love the Gem reveal d   With Tenderness  and Converse sweet  to prove  At once the Joys and calm Delights of Love   Her Fancy lively  and her Judgment true   Perfect in Nature  and in Morals too   Her Air coquettish  but her Mind a Prude   Her Body wanton  but her Soul not lewd   Rivals by Turns  her Mind and Person charms   Allays the Lover  and the Husband warms   Page  89Who pleas d at first  and yet at last pleas d more   My future Hope  and yet my present Store   These are thy Worth  not Dow r told down in Gold   Too dearly purchas d for thy Merit sold   Thy Virtues
