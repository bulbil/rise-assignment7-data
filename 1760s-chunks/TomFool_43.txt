above five Years  I had somehow or other run my Estate a little out of Breath   During my being rusticated  I married an Heiress with 7000 l  in her own Hands  which she put me in Possession of on the Day of Marriage  but had she not been one of the finest Women in England  as to Person  her Money should never have made me trammel myself in the matrimonial Tether  I was   183always too full of Spirits for a domestic sedentary Life  I could not bear Confinement  cooped up like a tame Rabbit  no  I must run wild about the Forest like a free bred Buck  or  as Lothario  says  like the Birds  great Nature s happy Commoners     I brought my Bride up to Town  to let the World bear Witness to my Happiness  I showed her off at every public Place  she was not quite so fond of Ostentation as she ought to have been  I could perceive Operas and Routs not so infinitely agreeable to her  as I could have wished them  she was rather too rural in her Taste  for by all that s odd  she whispered me in the Ear only at the second Masquerade we were at  that she thought it very insipid  Superlatively simple you must suppose her to be  not but now and then she was well enough  In her Opinion  as far as an English Author  or  as Garrick s acting  any Thing in the serious Way pleased her well enough   There is something in that Garrick s Execution excessively clever  I can  I believe  without Vanity  do as many droll Things  as all the choice Spirits put together  but I don t know how it is  I never could get at what he does  as to   184the rest of the Actors  I was at Home  but he has got a Sort of a Knack that s past finding out  and yet he seems so easy in what he does  as if it was natural to him  I believe  in acting  as well as free Masonry  there s a Secret not to be divulged  I beg Pardon  Sir  for this Observation  but theatrical Knowledge is as useful for a Man of Fortune in London  as classical Knowledge is at the University   My Wife  after we had been in Town about two Months  began  tho  in the most tender Manner  to complain I absented myself too much from her  wish d to have a little more of my Company  begged me  since I was so very entertaining Abroad  that I would indulge her now and then with my Conversation at Home  It went against me  I must confess  to deny her  but I had so many Invitations  and was so universally admired as a Companion  I could not help it  as to pleasing one s Wife  or the Pleasure a Man can receive from her Applause  it was not forcible enough for one of my Spirits  yet I made a secret Resolution  altho  I was too much from her at present  when I grew old  she should have me all to herself     185I have sometimes since thought  that a Man may have too great a Quantity of Spirits  for I could not stay at Home  and I was fearful too if I had  that the World would have given out  I had drowned my Faculties in the Cawdle cup  The Ambition I had to be counted the cleverest Fellow in England  forced me to enter too much into the Spirit of Things  I sat up too late  drank too deep  used rather too much Ridicule  and slighted the finest Woman in England  and all often against my Inclination — but he who has a Mind to gain a great Name  must sacrifice his private Connections to the Opinions of the Public   My Wife  to wean me  as she thought  from what here Country Simplicity called dangerous Habits  told me  that most of my Friends  tho  she would not particularize them  were Villains  that they had at different Times hinted Love to her  therefore begged me to be more at Home  if it was only to protect her from such Insults for the future   But I saw through the Scheme  she was a good Girl  but a bad Politician  I smiled and told her  Politeness and Sincerity were as incompatible  as Hudibras and Algebra  or common Sense and much Ceremony  that the more Men   186made Love to my Wife  only proclaim d the more the Goodness of my Taste  in fixing upon so inestimable a Jewel  I was conscious  I told her  she loved me  bid her not be whimsical  chucked her under the Chin  vowed I adored her  ordered a Chair  and dined with Lucy Cooper   I must confess  I believe the Lady I married  was not only one of the finest Women in England  but as good a one as ever lived  I had not indeed an Opportunity to discover all her good Qualities  but this was the Character every Body gave her  I should not have been a Stranger to her Perfections  had
