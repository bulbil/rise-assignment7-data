deceive   you   give yourself up to heaven  and you will soon be enabled to   despise the fickle hopes of earth       Instead of saying any thing to comfort her  in this manner was she   continually persecuted  and tho  it is impossible for any one to have   less inclination to a monastic life than she had  yet the depression of   her spirits  the firm belief she now should never see du Plessis more    the misfortune of her circumstances  joined to the artifices they made   use of  and the repeated offers of accepting her without the usual sum   paid on such occasions  might possibly at last have prevailed on   her   She was half convinced in her mind that it was the only asylum   left to shield her from the wants and insults of the world  and the more   she reflected on the changes  the perplexities  and vexation  of   different kinds  the few years she yet had lived had presented her with    the more reason she found to acquiesce with the persuasions of the   abbess  But heaven would not suffer the deceit practised on her to be   crowned with success  and discovered it to her timely enough to prevent   her from giving too much way to that despair  which alone could have   prevailed with her to yield to their importunities       There was among the sisterhood a young lady called donna Leonora  who   being one of many daughters of a family  more eminent for birth than   riches  was compelled  as too many are  to become a nun  in order to   prevent her marrying beneath her father s dignity  She had taken a great   liking to Louisa from the moment she came into the convent  and a   farther acquaintance ripened it into a sincere friendship  Tho  secluded   from the world  the austere air of a monastery had no effect upon her    she still retained her former vivacity  and it was only in the   conversations these two had toge whenever they could separate from the   others  that Louisa found any cordial to revive her now almost   sinking spirits       One day as she was ruminating on her melancholy affairs  this young nun   came hastily into her chamber  and with a countenance that  before she   spoke  denoted she had something very extraordinary to acquaint her   with   dear sister  cried she  I bring you the most surprising news  but   such as will be my ruin if you take the least notice of receiving it   from me  and perhaps your own  if you seem to be acquainted with it   at all       It is not to be doubted but Louisa gave her all the assurances she could   desire of an inviolable secrecy  after which  know then  resumed this   sweet condition d lady  that your lover  monsieur du Plessis  is not   only living  but as faithful as your soul can wish  or as you once   believed   the cruelty of the abbess  and some of the sisterhood in the   plot with her  have concealed the letters he has sent to you  in order   to persuade you to become a nun   I tremble to think of their hypocrisy   and deceit   but what  continued she  is not to be expected from bigotry   and enthusiasm   To increase the number of devotees they scruple   nothing  and vainly imagine the means is sanctified by the end       Little is it in the power of words to express the astonishment Louisa   was in to hear her speak in this manner  but as she had no room to doubt   her sincerity  only asked by what means she had attained the knowledge   of what the persons concerned  no doubt  intended to keep as much a   secret as possible  on which the other satisfied her curiosity in   these terms       To confess the truth to you  said she  I stole this afternoon into the   chapel  in order to read a little book brought me the other day by one   of my friends  as it treated on a subject not allowable in a convent  I   thought that the most proper place to entertain myself with it  and was   sitting down in one of the confessionals  when hearing the little door   open from the gallery  I saw the abbess and sister Clara  who  you know    is her favourite and confidant  come in together  and as soon as they   were entered  shut the door after them  I cannot say I had any curiosity   to hear their discourse  but fearing to be suspected by them in my   amusement  and not knowing what excuse to make for being there  if I   were seen  I slid down
