of amusement  but the first for instruction  I would chuse to have others for my acquaintance  but Englishmen for my friends   LETTER LXXXIX  To the same   THE mind is ever ingenious in making its own distress  The wandering beggar  who has none to protect  to feed  or to shelter him  fancies complete happiness in labour and a full meal  take him from rags and want  feed  cloath  and employ him  his wishes now rise one step above his station  he could be happy were he possessed of raiment  food  and ease  Suppose his wishes gratified even in these  his prospects widen as he ascends  he finds himself in affluence and tranquillity indeed  but indolence soon breeds anxiety  and he desires not only to be freed from pain  but to be possessed of pleasure  pleasure is granted him  and this but opens his soul to ambition  and   115 ambition will be sure to taint his future happiness  either with jealousy  disappointment  or fatigue   But of all the arts of distress found out by man for his own torment  perhaps  that of philosophic misery is most truly ridiculous  a passion no where carried to so extravagant an excess as in the country where I now reside  It is not enough to engage all the compassion of a philosopher here  that his own globe is harassed with wars  pestilence  or barbarity  he shall grieve for the inhabitants of the moon  if the situation of her imaginary mountains happens to alter  and dread the extinction of the sun  if the spots on his surface happen to encrease  one should imagine  that philosophy was introduced to make men happy  but here it serves to make hundreds miserable   My landlady some days ago brought me the diary of a philosopher of this desponding sort  who had lodged in the apartment before me  It contains the history of a life  which seems to be one continued tissue of sorrow  apprehension  and distress  A single week will serve as a specimen of the whole   Monday  In what a transient decaying situation are we placed  and what various reasons does philosophy furnish to make mankind unhappy A single grain of mustard shall continue to produce its similitude through numberless successions  yet what has been granted to this little seed has been denied to our planetary system  the mustard seed is still unaltered  but the system is growing old  and must quickly fall to decay  How terrible will it be  when the motions of all the   116 planets have at last become so irregular as to need repairing  when the moon shall fall into frightful paroxysms of alteration  when the earth  deviating from its ancient track  and with every other planet forgetting its circular revolutions  shall become so eccentric  that unconfined by the laws of system  it shall fly off into boundless space  to knock against some distant world  or fall in upon the sun  either extinguishing his light  or burned up by his flames in a moment  Perhaps while I write  this dreadful change is begun  Shield me from universal ruin  Yet ideot man laughs  sings  and rejoices in the very face of the sun  and seems no way touched with his situation   Tuesday  Went to bed in great distress  awaked and was comforted  by considering that this change was to happen at some indefinite time  and therefore  like death  the thoughts of it might easily be borne  But there is a revolution  a fixed determined revolution  which must certainly come to pass  yet which  by good fortune  I shall never feel  except in my posterity  The obliquity of the equator with the ecliptic is now twenty minutes less than when it was observed two thousand years ago by Piteas  If this be the case  in six thousand the obliquity will be still less by an whole degree  This being supposed  it is evident  that our earth  as Louville has clearly proved  has a motion  by which the climates must necessarily change place  and  in the space of about one million of years  England shall actually travel to the Antarctic pole  I shudder at the change  How shall our unhappy grandchildren endure the hideous climate  A million of years will soon be accomplished  they are but a moment when compared   117 to eternity  then shall our charming country  as I may say  in a moment of time  resemble the hideous wilderness of Nova Zembla   Wednesday  To night  by my calculation  the long predicted comet is to make its first appearance  Heavens  what terrors are impending over our little dim speck of earth  Dreadful visitation  Are we to be scorched in its fires  or only smothered in the vapour of its tail  That is the question  Thoughtless mortals  go build houses  plant orchards  purchase estates  for to morrow you die  But what if the comet should not come  That would be equally fatal  Comets are servants which periodically return to supply the sun with fuel  If our sun therefore should be disappointed of the expected supply  and all his fuel be in the mean time burnt out  he must expire like an exhausted taper
