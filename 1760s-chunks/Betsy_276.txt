endeavour   to follow your ladyship s advice  and  since I am a wife  will do my   best to make the yoke I have submitted to  sit as lightly upon me as   possible        Lady Trusty perceiving her spirits were very much depressed  omitted   nothing  that the shortness of time would allow  to persuade her to   believe  that her condition was not so unhappy  in reality  as she at   present imagined it to be  and having brought her to somewhat of a more   chearful temper  conducted her into the room where Sir Ralph and Mr    Munden were still discoursing on the matter in question        Welcome  my fair charge   cried the former  taking her by the hand  and   drawing her towards Mr  Munden   I have once already had the honour of   giving you to this gentleman  permit me to do so a second time  I hope   with the same satisfaction  on both sides  as at first         On mine  by Heaven  it is   replied Mr  Munden  flying hastily to   embrace her  as she moved slowly forward   if my dearest Betsy will   promise to forget what is past  the pains I have suffered  during this   interruption of my happiness  will be a sufficient security for her    that I shall be very careful for the future to avoid doing any thing   that may again subject me to the like misfortune        These words  and the tender air which he assumed in speaking them  were   so much beyond what Mrs  Munden could have expected from him  after his   late treatment of her  that all her pride  her anger  and even her   indifference  subsided at that instant  and gave place to sentiments of   the most gentle nature        You must believe   answered she  with an infinity of sweetness in her   voice and eyes   that I have also had my share of anguish  but whatever   inquietudes you have sustained on my account must be forgotten on your   part  as it shall be mine to make atonement for them by every thing in   my power  which can flatter me with the hopes of doing so        Insensible and morose as Mr  Munden was  he could not avoid  on this   obliging behaviour in his fair wife  being touched in reality with some   soft emotions  which he so well knew how to magnify the appearance of    that not only herself  but the bye standers  imagined he was the most   transported man alive       Impossible it is to express how much Sir Ralph  and his good lady    rejoiced to see this happy event  they entertained them very elegantly   at dinner  in the afternoon they went all together to take the air in   Kensington Gardens  and a great deal of company coming in the evening to   visit Lady Trusty  every thing contributed to keep up the spirit and   good humour of the newly re united pair                CHAPTER XI       Contains some few particulars which followed the reconciliation          Though this reconciliation was not altogether sincere on the side of Mr    Munden  yet being made in the presence of Sir Ralph and Lady Trusty  it   kept him from giving any flagrant remonstrations  at present  that it   was not so  and he continued to live with his amiable wife in the most   seeming good harmony for some time       She  on her part  performed with the utmost exactitude all she had   promised to him  and though she could not be said to feel for him all   that warmth of affection which renders the discharge of our duty so   great a pleasure to ourselves  yet her good nature and good sense well   supplied that deficiency  and left him no room to accuse her of the   least failure in what might be expected from the best of wives       During this interval of tranquillity  she lost the society of two   persons  the tenderness of whose friendship for her she had experienced   in a thousand instances  Mr  Francis Thoughtless  who had stayed so long   in town  merely through the indulgence of his commanding officer  was   now obliged to repair to his regiment  then quartered at Leeds in   Yorkshire  and Sir Ralph Trusty  having finished his affairs in town    his lady returned with him to their country seat       Thus was she almost at once deprived of the only two persons to whom she   could impart her mind without reserve  or on
