of any of those who visited Lady Mellasin  though  being   accustomed to hear declarations which had the appearance of love  yet   were really no more than words of course  and made indiscriminately to   every fine woman  she would not presently persuade herself that this was   more serious       The first victim of her charms was the only son of a very rich alderman    and having a fortune left him by a relation  independent of his father    who was the greatest miser in the world  he was furnished with the means   of mingling with the  beau monde   and of making one at every diversion   that was proposed       He had fancied Miss Flora a mighty fine creature  before he saw Miss   Betsy  but the imaginary flame he had for her was soon converted into a   sincere one for the other  He truly loved her  and was almost distracted   at the little credit she gave to his professions  His perseverance  his   tremblings whenever he approached her  his transports on seeing her  his   anxieties at taking leave  so different from what she had observed in   any other of those who had pretended to lift themselves under the banner   of her charms  at length convincing her of the conquest she had made    awakened in her breast that vanity so natural to a youthful mind  She   exulted  she plumed herself  she used him ill and well by turns  taking   an equal pleasure in raising or depressing his hopes  and  in spite of   her good nature  felt no satisfaction superior to that of the   consciousness of a power of giving pain to the man who loved her  but   with how great a mortification this short lived triumph was succeeded    the reader shall presently be made sensible                CHAPTER III       Affords matter of condolence  or raillery  according to the humour the   reader happens to be in for either          We often see  that the less encouragement is given to the lover s suit    with the more warmth and eagerness he prosecutes it  and many people are   apt to ascribe this hopeless perseverance to an odd perverseness in the   very nature of love  but  for my part  I rather take it to proceed from   an ambition of surmounting difficulties  it is not  however  my province   to enter into any discussion of so nice a point  I deal only in matters   of fact  and shall not meddle with definition       It was not till after Miss Betsy had reason to believe she had engaged   the heart of her lover too far for him to recal it  that she began to   take a pride in tormenting  While she looked on his addresses as of a   piece with those who called themselves her admirers  she had treated him   in that manner which she thought would most conduce to make him really   so  but no sooner did she perceive  by the tokens before mentioned  that   his passion was of the most serious nature  than she behaved to him in a   fashion quite the reverse  especially before company  for as she had not   the least affection  or even a liking towards him  his submissive   deportment under the most cold  sometimes contemptuous  carriage  could   afford her no other satisfaction  than  as she fancied  it shewed the   power of her beauty  and piqued those ladies of her acquaintance  who   could not boast of such an implicit resignation and patient suffering   from their lovers  in particular  Miss Flora  who she could not forbear   imagining looked very grave on the occasion  What foundation there was   for a conjecture of this nature was nevertheless undiscoverable till a   long time after       As this courtship was no secret to any of the family  Mr  Goodman   thought himself obliged  both as the guardian of Miss Betsy  and the   friend of Alderman Saving   for so the father of this young enamorato   was called  to enquire upon what footing it stood  He thought  that if   the old man knew and approved of his son s inclinations  he would have   mentioned the affair to him  as they frequently saw each other  and it   seemed to him neither for the interest nor reputation of his fair   charge  to receive the clandestine addresses of any man whatsoever  She   had a handsome fortune of her own  and he thought that  and her personal   accomplishments  sufficiently entitled her to as good a match as Mr    Saving  but then he knew the sordid nature of the alderman  and that all   the merits of Miss Betsy would add nothing in the
