theatric Breasts   Her Majesty s Death shutting up the Houses  my Tragedy was postpon d— but hold  I am premature in my Story  I was mentioning about our Printer s Prentice rehearsing several Parts of Plays with me  One Day  by a Fatality the greatest Metaphysician never cou d account for  as we were performing the Couch Scene of Loveless and Berinthia  I granted him the last Favour  Somewhat hung over me  impelling me  as it were  and made such Actions unavoidable  His Youth and Eagerness made me forgive him  his Obedience and Assiduity made me doat on him   As soon as he was out of his Time  we were lawfully marry d  till unluckily taking Lodgings for the Air in Moorfeilds  he became acquainted with some of the Tabernacle Preachers there  they thunder d so much in his Head about Sin  and such Stuff  I was forced to put   33him among the Incurables  I then found a Friend  in the Gentleman with whom I am at present  He s a Physician —it is true indeed he travels —What then   Tis his Humanity only that wakes him keep a Stage  People in every Town press him to settle with them  but as I and my Husband tell them  if he was confin d to one Spot  what must become of the rest of England  For Country Doctors and Apothecaries are so ignorant —my God  And yet to see the Force of Genius  The Doctor took it all himself  he was not bred up to it  His Father is only a Ticket Porter —What then  The Parent of Socrates made Barbers Blocks     34  CHAP  VI   THE next Day Junior and his Lady prepared to set forward  But as Mrs  Slymstraat was putting up her Things  she discovered the Doctor s Wife and the Merry Andrew in a too familiar Conversation   When Junior heard of this  he took his Mother aside  to expostulate with her  But she interrupted him  saying — Child  there is an essential Distinction between voluntary Sin  and the Necessity of acting  As for what happened between me and Robin  it was no more than an Accident of Matter  I was lost in Reflection  It was not criminal in me  I was merely passive  therefore not culpable  because not intentionally guilty  But as for that Infidel to reproach me with want of Taste  me —no Junior  I love you as much as a Mother ought  but never see my Face again  unless you part from that Unbeliever  Then instantly bridling herself up  she stalk d out of the Room with the Straddle  Toss  and Importance of an Haymarket Signiora  after finishing a Da Capo     35Junior appeared at Tunbridge to be quite the Thing  He dress d gay  drank deeply  play d high  swore elegantly  and sung drolly  He was Master of Arts in Sentiment making  had all Odds ad Unguem  As for the Pedigree of a Plate Horse  he was a critical Genealogist   He took Care to make much Parade of his Honour  therefore was thought to be one of very strict Principle —For it was his Maxim  that  according to the first Impression which you make upon the Company  thro  that Medium you will be afterwards look d at   Among the many Personages who exhibited themselves at the Wells that Season  there was a Person  who by his Address seem d to be a Gentleman  He was allow d to be a very sensible Man  by an Observation or two which he made at a Picture Sale  the Day he came down —He was allow d to be very rich too—Yet so great an Oddity  he never went to the Gaming Table  rarely to the Tavern  and then not a Word of Politics slipt from him —He seem d very fond of reading  which made the very polite Company there fancy he had crack d his Brain by Study     36The inquisitive Club had been very busy in enquiring after him —A Club  where Scandal —but why shou d Spleen fall from a Poet s Pen —No  it is proper some People shou d meddle with other Peoples Business  It is the Duty we owe our Country  a Duty we owe our Neighbours  a Duty we own ourselves  to be assiduous in our Questions  not only concerning Persons we don t know  but more especially to examine into every Report that is propagated of Intrigue  or Male practices  in our Friends and those we do know   Junior  whose Scheme was to make all the Acquaintance he cou d among money d Men  judg d this Gentleman well worth knowing  and soon made the Stranger s Temper his Study —For like Alcibiades  Jack cou d be any thing  with any Man   But what is Tom Fool doing all this while  Why  must the History of a Sharper —a dull Copy of Count Fathom  be retail d upon the Reader  Is it judgment to suffer the principal Character in this Epic to be idle so long  and let an Episode in Bulk exceed the grand History  When Tom Fool was in Goal  nothing cou d be expected from him  But now he is married  every thing
