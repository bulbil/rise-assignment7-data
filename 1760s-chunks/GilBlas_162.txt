from such a perennial stream of joy  Pedro de la Membrilla was introduced upon the scene  he must have his name back again  whatever the restitution may cost me  Your promise binds you hand and foot to fix upon him for your son in law  it is your duty to give him the preference  without taking my rank and station into the account  without mercy on the forlorn condition to which you are going to reduce me  To be sure  it might be said  but then I should say it who ought not to say it  that your brother had only the authority of an uncle over your daughter  that you are her father  and that there is more right and reason in discharging an actual debt of gratitude towards your preserver  than in being mealy mouthed about a verbal promise which would press but lightly on the conscience of the most scrupulous casuist   Yes  without doubt  that argument is indisputable  exclaimed Jerome de Moyadas  and on that ground there can no longer be any question between you and Pedro de la Membrilla  If my brother Austin were still living  he would not think it bad morality to give the preference to a man who has saved my life  nor a bad speculation to close the bargain with a prince who has not disdained to court our alliance  It were an absolute suicide on the part of all my opening prospects  the frantic desperation of an acknowledged incurable  not to dispose of my daughter so illustriously  not to solicit your highness s acceptance of her hand  And yet  sir  resumed I  these things are not to be determined without due deliberation  look at your own interests and safety with a microscopic eye  for though the illustrious channel through which my blood has flowed for ages         You are scarcely serious  interrupted he  in supposing that I can hesitate for a moment  No  may it please your highness  it is my most humble and earnest request that you will deign  on this very evening  to honour the happy Florence with your hand  Well  then  said I  be it so  go yourself and be the bearer of the unlooked  for tidings  announce to her the brilliant career of her exalted destiny   While the good citizen was putting his best foot foremost  to instil into his daughter that she had made the conquest of a prince  Moralez  who had taken in the whole conversation with greedy ear  threw himself upon his knees before me  and did homage in these bantering terms  Most potent  grave  and august Italian prince  son of a sovereign  supreme over a nest of inaccessible valleys  lying between Switzerland  the Milanese  and Savoy  permit me to humble myself at your highness s feet  in humble acknowledgment of the ecstasy into which you have thrown me  By the honour of a swindler  you are one of the wonders of our world  I always thought myself the first man in the line  but in good truth I doff my bonnet before you  whose genius seems to supersede the lessons of experience  Then you are no longer uneasy about the result  said I to my colleague in iniquity  Oh  as to that  not in the least  answered he  I no longer care a fig for Master Pedro  let him come as soon as he pleases  we are a match for him  Here we are  then  Moralez and myself  safe seated on the saddle  and rising in our stirrups  We even went so far as to begin settling the course we should pursue with the fortune  on which we reckoned so securely  that if it had already been in our pockets  we could not have chuckled more triumphantly over the proverb of  a bird in the hand   Yet we were not in actual possession  which is more than legal right  and the sequel of the adventure proved to us  that manythings fall out between the cup and the lip   We very soon saw the young man of Calatrava returning  He was accompanied by two citizens and by an alguazil  whose dignity was as much supported by his whiskers  and by the lowering overcast of his swarthy aspect  as by the weight of his official character  Florence s father was of the party  Signor de Moyadas  said Pedro to him  here are three honest people come to answer for me  they are acquainted with my person  and can tell you who I am  Yes  undoubtedly  exclaimed the alguazil  I can depose to the fact  I certify to all those whom it may concern  that you are known to me  your name is Pedro  and you are the only son of Juan Valez de la Membrilla  whosoever dares to maintain the contrary is an impostor  I believe you implicitly  master alguazil  said the good creature Jerome de Moyadas  rather drily  Your evidence is gospel to me  as well as that of these fair and honest tradesmen you have brought with you  I am fully satisfied that the young gentleman on whose behalf you come is the only son of my brother s correspondent  But what is that to me  I am no longer in the humour
