taking one of her fair hands  kissed it with an affectionate and impassioned action  My dear Antonia  said I  your frankness enchants me  go on  let nothing induce you to depart from it  you are conversing with your future husband  let your soul expand itself  and reveal all its inmost emotions in his presence  Thus  then  may I entertain the flattering hope that you will not frown on the union of our destinies  The coming in of Basil at this moment prevented me from giving further vent to the delightful sensations which thrilled through me  Impatient to know how his daughter had behaved  and ready primed for scolding in case she had been perverse or coy  he made up to me immediately  Well  now  said he  are you satisfied with Antonia  So much so  answered I  that I am going this very moment to set forward the preparations for our marriage  So saying  I left the father and daughter  for the purpose of taking counsel with my secretary thereupon       CH  IX     Nuptials of Gil Blas with the fair Antonia  the style and manner of the ceremony  the persons assisting thereat  and the festivities ensuing there upon   THOUGH there was no occasion to consult with the lords of Leyva about my marriage  yet both Scipio and myself were of opinion that I could not decently do otherwise than communicate to them my purpose of connecting myself with Basil s daughter  and just pay them the compliment of asking their advice  after the act was finally determined on   I immediately went off for Valencia  where my visit was a matter of surprise  and still more the purport of it Don Caesar and Don Alphonso  who were acquainted with Antonia  having seen her more than once  wished me joy on my good fortune in a wife  Don Caesar  in particular  made his speech upon the occasion with so much youthful fire  that if there had not been reason to suppose his lordship weaned  by that icy moralist  time  from certain naughty propensities  I should have suspected him of going to Lirias now and then  not so much to look after his concerns there  as after his little empress of the dairy  Seraphina  too  with the kindest assurances of a lively interest in whatever might befall me  said that she had heard a very favourable character of Antonia  but  added she  with a malicious fling  as if to taunt me with my supercilious reception of Sephora s amorous advances  even though her beauty had not been so much the talk of the country  I could have depended on your taste  from former experience of its delicacy and fastidiousness   Don Caesar and his son did not stop at cold approbation of my marriage  but declared that they would defray all the expenses of it  Measure back your steps  said they  to Lirias  and stay quietly there till you hear further from us  Make no preparation for your nuptials  for we shall make that our concern  To meet their kind intentions with becoming gratitude  I returned to my mansion  and acquainted Basil and his daughter with the projected kindness of our patrons  We determined to wait their pleasure with as much patience as falls to the lot of poor human nature under such circumstances  Eight long days dragged out their tedious measure  and brought no tidings of our bliss  But the rewards of self control are not the less assured for being slow  on the ninth  a coach drawn by four mules drove up  with a cargo of mantua makers for the bride  and an assortment of rich silks on which to exercise their art  Several livery servants  mounted on mules  accompanied the cavalcade  One of them brought me a letter from Don Alphonso  That nobleman sent me word that he would be at Lirias next day with his father and his wife  and that the marriage ceremony should he performed on the day after that  by the vicar general of Valencia  And just so it came to pass  Don Caesar  his son  and Seraphina  with that venerable dignitary  were punctual to their appointment  all four of them in a coach and six  none of your mules  like the mantua makers  preceded by an other coach and four  with Seraphina s women  and the rear was brought up by a company of the governor s guards   The governor s lady had hardly entered the house before she testified an ardent longing to see Antonia  who on her part no sooner knew that Seraphina was arrived  than she ran forward to bid her welcome  with a respectful kiss upon her hand  so gracefully and modestly impressed  that all the company were enchanted at the action  And now  madam  said Don Caesar to his daughter in law  what do you think of Antonia  Could Santillane have made a better choice  No  answered Seraphina  they are worthy each of the other  there can be no doubt but their union will be most happy  In short  every one was lavish in the praise of my intended  and if they felt her beams so powerfully under the eclipse of a stuff gown  what must they not have endured from
