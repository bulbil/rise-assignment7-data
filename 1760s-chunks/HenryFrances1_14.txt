Safeguard too  thro  all the dangerous Paths of Life   LETTER XXI   My dear FANNY   WE might have got farther To night  but I chose to stop here  for two Reasons  the first was my Impatience to write to you  and the next  that I was heartily tired of my Companion  who was too well mounted  to escape from on the Road —but I have locked myself up here   He is one of those Matter of fact Men  who  being incapable of striking out any Thing  or Idea  from their own Sense  or Imaginations  are eternally talking of what they have seen or heard  as if they were reading over a Memorandum Book  and whose whole Conversation is  a Diary of their Lives  for which Reason  they are never tired of talking  because they are themselves the chief Subject matter of their Discourse  I asked him  a little peevishly  this Evening  whether he had ever committed Muder    30 that he could not bear his own Thoughts a Moment   Perhaps I should have borne him  with more Patience  at any other Time  but  having so lately parted from your charming Converse  I became more nice about my Company  and less capable of any Entertainment  except this of Writing to you  while the happy Wretch is prating  below Stairs  to the Waiter   I have not Time now to send you the Rules  or Maxims  you promised to conduct yourself by  with Regard to your Life and Health  but  if you consult your own Reason and Understanding  I flatter myself  you will have the Essence of them  before I can reduce them into a dull Form   Adio Cara   LETTER XXII   Dear HARRY   I HAVE no News to write  but what I believe is none at present  that I am very angry with you  Now  do but observe  Spectators  what an innocent Countenance he puts on  such Gentleness of Manners  and Demureness of Features  that it would require Proofs  equal to Mathematical Demonstration  to convict him  and yet I know this plausible Man to be worse   31 than a Devil  because he has Art enough to hide his cloven Foot  But  alas  Rage is the shortest Passion of a Woman s Soul  and I find  to quote a Passage from one of your Letters  that   Absence to Lovers  like Death to Enemies  buries every Fault  and enlivens every Virtue   However  I am glad that you are in the Country  that I may have the Pleasure to think of you  in the most amicable Light  tho  it is possible I lye  for  perhaps  I have done nothing else  but wish you back  ever since you went  Yet it is a vain Task to think of rivalling your Naids  Dryades  and Hamadryads  so  in Allusion to your Song  I must  make a Virtue of Necessity   and be content     I am quite ashamed of this vile penned Scrawl  not of Quality  but I hope you will excuse it  when I tell you  that this Pen was made by Noah  and plucked from the Wing of that ungrateful Raven  which flew from the Ark  and returned not again  and has been worn to the Stump by old Maids  in making Anecdotes of Tea table talk ever since   Adieu     32  LETTER XXIII  HENRY to FRANCES   I DID not write to you before  because I thought it a Solecism  in good Breeding  to pay you a Visit  en passant  as Country Gentlemen call it  making an Inn of one s House  Besides  it would have been no Compliment to you  to have wrote from an Inn  where I was dull and idle  so deferred it   till I came here  where I have a World of Business  and the highest Entertainment  that a Number of agreeable Women can give to a Man of my Constitution  And  to raise the Compliment higher    car il est bon de se fair valoir   I assure you  I have a Struggle with myself  at present  about Writing to you at all  lest my Letters should fall into aukward Hands  during Tom s Illness  but my Inclinations  with Regard to you  have always been too strong for my Prudence  so on I venture  with a  hoping these few Lines   c   I cannot forgive your making Noah s Messenger a Raven  a Bird of ill Omen  when you might have made so many pretty Allusions to the Dove  Emblem of Love and Peace  I beg henceforward your Quills may be gently drawn from the Pinion of the fond cooing Turtle  and   33 that the harsh Croking of that boading Fowl may never once assault my Ears   Here I might bring in a Subject matter applicable  but shall postpone it  till I am sure there are none but Friends by  The same Reason shall prevent me from giving my Thoughts upon the Business you mentioned to me at parting   till I hear Tom is able to
