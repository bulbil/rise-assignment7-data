I will not keep you in suspense       I went to Mrs  Jervis s chamber  and  O dreadful  my wicked master had   hid himself  base gentleman as he is  in her closet  where she has a   few books  and chest of drawers  and such like  I little suspected it    though I used  till this sad night  always to look into that closet   and another in the room  and under the bed  ever since the summer house   trick  but never found any thing  and so I did not do it then  being   fully resolved to be angry with Mrs  Jervis for what had happened in the   day  and so thought of nothing else       I sat myself down on one side of the bed  and she on the other  and we   began to undress ourselves  but she on that side next the wicked closet    that held the worst heart in the world  So  said Mrs  Jervis  you won t   speak to me  Pamela  I find you are angry with me  Why  Mrs  Jervis    said I  so I am  a little   tis a folly to deny it  You see what I have   suffered by your forcing me in to my master  and a gentlewoman of your   years and experience must needs know  that it was not fit for me to   pretend to be any body else for my own sake  nor with regard to my   master       But  said she  who would have thought it would have turned out so  Ay    said I  little thinking who heard me  Lucifer always is ready to promote   his own work and workmen  You see presently what use he made of it    pretending not to know me  on purpose to be free with me  And when he   took upon himself to know me  to quarrel with me  and use me hardly  And   you too  said I  to cry  Fie  fie  Pamela  cut me to the heart  for that   encouraged him       Do you think  my dear  said she  that I would encourage him   I never   said so to you before  but  since you have forced it from me  I must   tell you  that  ever since you consulted me  I have used my utmost   endeavours to divert him from his wicked purposes  and he has promised   fair  but  to say all in a word  he doats upon you  and I begin to see   it is not in his power to help it       I luckily said nothing of the note from Mr  Jonathan  for I began to   suspect all the world almost  but I said  to try Mrs  Jervis  Well then    what would you have me do  You see he is for having me wait on Lady   Davers now       Why  I ll tell you freely  my dear Pamela  said she  and I trust to your   discretion to conceal what I say  my master has been often desiring me   to put you upon asking him to let you stay          Yes  said I  Mrs  Jervis  let me interrupt you  I will tell you why I   could not think of that  It was not the pride of my heart  but the pride   of my honesty  For what must have been the case  Here my master has been   very rude to me  once and twice  and you say he cannot help it  though   he pretends to be sorry for it  Well  he has given me warning to leave   my place  and uses me very harshly  perhaps to frighten me to his   purposes  as he supposes I would be fond of staying  as indeed I should    if I could be safe  for I love you and all the house  and value him  if   he would act as my master   Well then  as I know his designs  and that   he owns he cannot help it  must I have asked to stay  knowing he would   attempt me again  for all you could assure me of  was  he would do   nothing by force  so I  a poor weak girl  was to be left to my own   strength  And was not this to allow him to tempt me  as one may say  and   to encourage him to go on in his wicked devices   How then  Mrs  Jervis    could I ask or wish to stay       You say well  my dear child  says she  and you have a justness of   thought above your years
