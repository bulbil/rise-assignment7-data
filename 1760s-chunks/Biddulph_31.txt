that he made no other reply than to bid my mother use her discretion  He came directly to me notwithstanding  and told me what had passed  It was then  for the first time  that I discovered I loved Mr Vere  I burst into tears  and clinging round my father’s neck  begged of him to save me from my mother’s rigour  My gesture and words were too passionate for him not to perceive that there was something more at my heart than mere dislike    of the old man  He charged me to deal sincerely  I loved him too well  and was myself too frank to do otherwise  In short  I confessed my inclination for Mr Vere  and his affection for me   Though my kind father chid me gently for admitting a lover without his or my mother’s approbation  yet at the same time he told me  he would endeavour to dissuade her from prosecuting the other match  though he could wish  he said  I would try to bring myself to accept of it  adding  he was afraid my mother would be much incensed by a denial   My mother was fond of grandeur  and would not like to have me marry any one  who could not at once make me mistress of a fine house  and a fine equipage  which I knew I must not expect to be the case with Mr Vere  His father had several children  and was very frugal in his temper  besides  as he was but of the middle age  and of a very healthy constitution  his son’s prospect of possessing the estate was  to all human appearance  at a very great distance   These discouragements  however  did not hinder me from indulging my wishes  My father’s tenderness was the foundation on which I built my hopes  I told Mr Vere the designs of one parent  and the kind condescension of the other  Emboldened by this information  he ventured to disclose his love to my father  begging his interest with my mother in his favour  He had a great kindness for the youth  and was so fond of me  that he would readily have consented to my happiness  if the fear of disobliging my mother had not checked him  He represented to her in the mildest manner  the utter dislike I had expressed of the proposed match  and conjured her not to insist on it  My mother  unused to be controuled  was filled with resentment both against him and me  she said  he encouraged me in my disobedience  and that  if he did not unite his authority to hers  in order to compel me to marry the gentleman she approved of  it would make a total breach between them   My good father  who loved my mother exceedingly  was alarmed at this menace  Unwilling to come to extremities either with her or me  he was at a loss how to act  His paternal love at length prevailed  and he determined  at all events  to save me from the violence which he knew would be put upon my heart   My mother had never condescended to talk to me on the subject  she thought my immediate obedience ought to have followed the bare knowlege of her will  She forbad me her sight  and charged me    never to appear before her  till I came with a determination to obey her   However severe this prohibition was  I yielded to it with the less reluctance  as my father’s tender love made me amends for my mother’s harshness  Perhaps  had she vouchsafed to reason a little with me  tempering her arguments with a motherly kindness  she would have found me as flexible as she could wish  but the course she took had a very contrary effect  I thought myself persecuted  and that it was for the honour of my love to persevere  On the other hand  my father’s secret indulgence encouraged me in the sentiments I entertained  and I now determined  not only to refuse my old lover  but to have my young one   My mother had given me a stated time in which I was to come to a resolution  and if I did not  at the expiration of it  acquiesce  I was to be pronounced a reprobate  and to be no more considered as her child  In this emergency I had recourse to my father  I told him there was nothing which I was not ready to suffer  rather than marry the man I hated  my greatest affliction was the uneasiness I saw him endure on my account  for my mother reproached him daily with my obstinacy   My father said  he thought the alternative offered by my mother  was to be avoided but in one way  and that was  by marrying Mr Vere  For  added he  when she finds you resolute in your refusal of her choice  not even my paternal authority will be able to screen you from her severity  and your life will be made miserable  without your father’s being able to relieve you  On the other hand  when you are out of her house  she cannot distress you  nor prevent me from doing you the justice which I owe my child  Nay  possibly in time  I may be
