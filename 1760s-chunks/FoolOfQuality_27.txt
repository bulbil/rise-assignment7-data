eight years  of which no record   seems to remain  he spent in Dublin as a chamber counsel  not   without success   and to have worked for eight years at so uncon    genial a business  in the very heyday  too  of his youth and   ambition  will redeem him somewhat from that imputation of want   of perseverance which is often urged against him  Let him have   the credit of having given the law a fair trial  His reasons for   throwing up his profession are easily guessed  The delays and   chicaneries of courts in the 18th century are well known  Henry   Brooke s judgment of them may be read at large in the   Fool of   Quality   The Irish Bar  too  was not in his days distinguished for   morality   and one may well conceive that Brooke  especially as a                     PREFACE  xlv     professed Liberal  found it difficult enough to earn his bread  and   yet remain an honest man      No wonder  then  that we find him in 1736 back again in London    He was welcomed there by Pope and Lord Lyttleton  Pitt  Lord   Chatham  introduced him to the Prince of Wales  who   caressed   him   say the biographers    with great familiarity  and presented   him with many elegant and valuable tokens of friendship china    books  paintings   c   What more could man need  in days when   nothing was to be gained without a patron  Unfortunately for   Brooke s final success in the world  his patron  the Prince  was in   opposition  and  as Brooke conceived  in his headlong chivalrous   Irish way  an oppressed hero  the martyr of his own virtues   and   he therefore   must needs  if he has a chance  openly espouse his   patron s quarrel  and thunder forth his wrongs to the world     Not so insane a purpose as it looks at first sight   for while the   Ministry practically consisted of Walpole  the Court  and the two   Newcastles  the Opposition numbered in the House  Pitt  Chester    field  Carteret  Wyndham  Pultney  Argyle  and  in a word  the   strongest men in England   and outside the House  as skirmishers   of the pen  Pope  Fielding  Johnson  and Glover  So that  even   from a worldly point of view  it was no unwise step in young   Brooke to bring out at Drury Lane his tragedy of Gustavus Vasa    full of patriotisms  heroisms  death to tyrants  indefeasible rights of   freemen  and other commonplaces  at which we can afford to sneer   now superciliously  it being not only the propensity but the right   of humanity to kick down the stool by which it has climbed      The play itself is good enough   its style that of the time   its   characters not so much human beings as vehicles for virtuous or   vicious sentiments  If Trollio  the courtier Archbishop of Upsal    be really meant for Walpole  he will stand equally well for any   ancient rascal  The only touch of what we now call human nature    in plain words  of casuistry  is to be found in the once famous   scene in which the tyrant tries to treat Gustavus  resolve by the   threat of murdering his mother and sister  In it there is real   dramatic power  superior  I should say  to that of any English   tragedian of the 18th century  and sufficient to redeem the play   from utter dreariness  in the eyes of a generation which has learnt   that old Swedes did not think  talk  and act half like Frenchmen    half like antique Komans  But the real worth of the play lay  and   lies still  in the loftiness of its sentiments  Those were times in   which men were coarser and more ignorant  but yet heartier and   healthier than now  Those  intricacies of the human heart     which  as unravelled either by profligate Frenchmen or pious   Englishwomen  are now in such high and all but sole demand    were then looked on chiefly as indigestions of the human stomach          T lvi PREFACE      or other physical organs   and the public wanted  over and above   the perennial subject of love  some talk at least about valour    patriotism  loyalty  chivalry  generosity  the protection of the   oppressed  the vindication of the innocent  and other like matters    which are now banished alike from pulpit and from stage  and only   call forth applause
