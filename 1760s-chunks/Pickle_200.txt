in his  possession  as soon as he should be able to accomplish this matrimonial  scheme   When Peregrine had settled all these points to his own satisfaction   he took leave of all his friends  and  repairing to the great city   purchased a new chariot and horses  put Pipes and another lacquey into  rich liveries  took elegant lodgings in Pall Mall  and made a most  remarkable appearance among the people of fashion   It was owing to this equipage  and the gaiety of his personal  deportment  that common fame  which is always a common liar  represented  him as a young gentleman who had just succeeded to an estate of five  thousand pounds per annum  by the death of an uncle  that he was  entitled to an equal fortune at the decease of his own father  exclusive  of two considerable jointures  which would devolve upon him at the  demise of his mother and aunt  This report  false and ridiculous as it  was  he could not find in his heart to contradict  Not but that he was  sorry to find himself so misrepresented  but his vanity would not allow  him to take any step that might diminish his importance in the opinion  of those who courted his acquaintance  on the supposition that his  circumstances were actually as affluent as they were said to be  Nay  so  much was he infatuated by this weakness  that he resolved to encourage  the deception  by living up to the report  and accordingly engaged  in the most expensive parties of pleasure  believing that  before his  present finances should be exhausted  his fortune would be effectually    6 22 15  3 45 PM   made  by the personal accomplishments he should have occasion to display  to the beau monde in the course of his extravagance  In a word  vanity  and pride were the ruling foibles of our adventurer  who imagined  himself sufficiently qualified to retrieve his fortune in various  shapes  long before he could have any idea of want or difficulty  He  thought he should have it in his power  at any time  to make a prize of  a rich heiress  or opulent widow  his ambition had already aspired to  the heart of a young handsome duchess dowager  to whose acquaintance  he had found means to be introduced  or  should matrimony chance to be  unsuitable to his inclinations  he never doubted  that  by the interest  he might acquire among the nobility  he should be favoured with some  lucrative post  that would amply recompense him for the liberality  of his disposition  There are many young men who entertain the same  expectations  with half the reason he had to be so presumptuous   In the midst of these chimerical calculations  his passion for Emilia  did not subside  but  on the contrary  began to rage with such an  inflammation of desire  that her idea interfered with every other  reflection  and absolutely disabled him from prosecuting the other lofty  schemes which his imagination had projected  He therefore laid down the  honest resolution of visiting her in all the splendour of his situation   in order to practise upon her virtue with all his art and address  to  the utmost extent of his affluence and fortune  Nay  so effectually  had his guilty passion absorbed his principles of honour  conscience   humanity  and regard for the commodore s last words  that he was base  enough to rejoice at the absence of his friend Godfrey  who  being then  with his regiment in Ireland  could not dive into his purpose  or take  measures for frustrating his vicious design   Fraught with these heroic sentiments  he determined to set out for  Sussex in his chariot and six  attended by his valet de chambre and  two footmen  and as he was now sensible that in his last essay he had  mistaken his cue  he determined to change his battery  and sap the  fortress  by the most submissive  soft  and insinuating behaviour   On the evening that preceded this proposed expedition  he went into one  of the boxes at the playhouse  as usual  to show himself to the ladies   and reconnoitring the company through a glass  for no other reason but  because it was fashionable to be purblind   perceived his mistress very  plainly dressed  in one of the seats above the stage  talking to another  young woman of a very homely appearance  Though his heart beat the  alarm with the utmost impatience at sight of his Emilia  he was for some  minutes deterred from obeying the impulse of his love  by the presence  of some ladies of fashion  who  he feared  would think the worse of him   should they see him make his compliment in public to a person of her  figure  Nor would the violence of his inclination have so far prevailed  over his pride  as to lead him thither  had he not recollected  that his  quality friends would look upon her as some handsome Abigail  with whom  he had an affair of gallantry  and of consequence give him credit
