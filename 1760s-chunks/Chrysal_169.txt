piece of villany that did such dishonour   to the sex  respect for the memory of the worthy man whose   name she bore would not permit him to expose  her to public   insult  However  to prevent her making the like attempt else    where  he resolved to shock her  by a personal detection  Accord    ingly  he made the gentleman write her word that it was improper   for him to be seen going to her house  but that  if she pleased  he   would meet her at eight that evening at a certain tavern  where she   should inquire for him by the name of Mr Trueman  Such a prospect   of immediate success made her blind to every appearance of deceit   or danger  and  accordingly  she prepared to attend the appointment   with the most sanguine expectation      But his lordship had prepared a reception for her which she   little suspected  Shortly before the time  he went to the tavern   with the gentleman  and fixing upon a room in wliich there was a   closet large enough for him and another nobleman  whom he took   with him  left word that if any lady should inquire for Mr Trueman    she should be told that he was above alone  and the gentleman   called down to her  As they judged  her impatience brought her   rather before the time  when her imagined confederate  showing   her up into the room  and placing her so that every word she said   might be heard in the closet  he entered into a conversation with   her on the subject of their meeting  in which he led her to repeat   her whole proposal  and by starting difScuIties  to enforce it with   every iniquitous argument in her power      As soon as his lordship thought she had said enough  he issued   from his concealment  and  looking her full in the face  calmly   thanked her for the care she was taking to preserve the noble family   of his relation  which she had whimsically given as one of the reasons         186 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     of her desiring this marriage  It is impossible to describe her   situation at the sight of this nobleman  whom she well knew  as   well as his interest in defeating her design  Astonishment  shame    and confusion struck her motionless and dumb  She was just able   to turn her eye to her betrayer  and then fell in a swoon upon the   floor  Such distress naturally softened the resentment of the   generous nobleman to whom she had designed such an injury   he   assisted to raise her from the ground  and  having with difficulty   brought her to herself  instead of aggravating her distress by re    proaches  mildly advised her to desist from such unjustifiable   schemes  and promised her that he would take no notice of what   had happened  if he found that her future conduct merited such   tenderness      This treatment had the wished effect  That false spirit  which   would have borne her up against any severity  sunk before such   unexpected delicacy and compassion  She melted into a flood of   tears  and  unable to utter a word  fell upon her knees and kissed   the hand of the nobleman in a rapture not to be expressed  who   immediately raised her from the ground  and telling her that he   imagined it must be disagreeable to her to stay there any longer    ordered a chair  and handed her to it himself  with the utmost   politeness and respect      Her situation when she got home was truly deplorable  The   assurance of her late hopes doubled the distress of her disappoint    ment  and the fear of shame made the thought of her guilt intoler    able  She cursed her own folly  the perfidy of her betrayer  and   all the ways of faithless man   and  in the agony of her grief resolved   to leave this detested town next morning  and bury herself for ever   from the world  in her country seat      This resolution she held in till next morning  when she actually   set out for the country   but I have reason to believe it did not hold   very long  as I have frequently seen her since in all public places    as gay and unconcerned as ever  As for me  I was given to her   coachman to pay the farrier who took care of her horses   but he   thought it more necessary to give me in payment of a debt of his   own to a man who kept a beer  house  who gave me to an attorney    to defend him against a prosecution for entertaining a gang of   street robbers
