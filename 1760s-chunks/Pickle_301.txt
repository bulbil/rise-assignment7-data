though he sat opposite to his fair enemy  that he was able  to pass some occasional jokes upon the new married couple  with some  appearance of mirth and good humour  Nor did Emily any otherwise seem  affected by his presence  than by excepting him from the participation  of those genial regards which she distributed to the rest of the  company  This easiness of behaviour on her side reinforced his  resolution  by giving him pretence to call her sensibility in question   for he could not conceive how any woman of acute feelings could sit  unmoved in presence of a man with whom she had such recent and intimate  connection  not considering that she had much more reason to condemn his    6 22 15  3 45 PM   affectation of unconcern  and that her external deportment might  like  his own  be an effort of pride and resentment   This contest  in point of dissimulation  continued till night  when the  company was paired for dancing  and Peregrine began the ball by walking  a minuet with the bride  then he took out the young lady to whom he was  recommended by Gauntlet  being very well pleased to see that her person  was such as might have inspired even Emily herself with jealousy   though  at the same time  he perceived his mistress coupled with a gay  young officer  whom  with all due deference to his own qualifications   he considered as no despicable rival  However  he himself first began  hostilities  by becoming all of a sudden particular with his partner   whom he forthwith assailed with flattering compliments  that soon  introduced the subject of love  upon which he expatiated with great  art and elocution  using not only the faculty of speech  but also the  language of the eyes  in which he was a perfect connoisseur   This behaviour soon manifested itself to the whole assembly  the  greatest part of whom believed that he was in good earnest captivated  by the charms of his partner  while Emilia  penetrating into his  design  turned his own artillery upon himself  by seeming to listen with  pleasure to the addresses of his rival  who was no novice in the art of  making love  She even affected uncommon vivacity  and giggled aloud at  every whisper which he conveyed into her ear  insomuch that she  in  her turn  afforded speculation to the company  who imagined the young  soldier had made a conquest of the bridegroom s sister  Pickle  himself began to cherish the same opinion  which gradually invaded his  good humour  and at length filled his bosom with rage  He strove to  suppress his indignation  and called every consideration of vanity  and revenge to his aid  He endeavoured to wean his eyes from the fatal  object that disturbed him  but they would not obey his direction and  command  He wished himself deprived of all sensation  when he heard  her laugh  and saw her smile upon the officer  and  in the course of  country dancing  when he was obliged to join hands with her  the touch  thrilled through all his nerves  and kindled a flame within him which he  could not contain  In a word  his endeavours to conceal the situation of  his thoughts were so violent  that his constitution could not endure the  shock  the sweat ran down his forehead in a stream  the colour vanished  from his cheeks  his knees began to totter  and his eyesight to fail  so  that he must have fallen at his full length upon the floor  had not he  retired very abruptly into another room  where he threw himself upon a  couch  and fainted   In this condition he was found by his friend  who  seeing him withdraw  with such symptoms of disorder  followed him thither  and  when he  recovered the use of his faculties  pressed him to make use of a bed in  that house  rather than expose himself in the night air  by going home  to his own lodgings  but not being able to prevail upon him to accept  the offer  he wrapped him up in a cloak  and  conducting him to the  inn where he lodged  helped him to undress and go to bed  where he was  immediately seized with a violent fit of the ague  Godfrey behaved with  great tenderness  and would have actually borne him company all night   notwithstanding the circumstances of his own situation  had not his  friend insisted upon his returning to the company  and making his  apology to his partner for his sudden departure  This was a step  absolutely necessary towards maintaining the quiet of the assembly   which he found in great consternation  occasioned by his absence  for    6 22 15  3 45 PM   some of the ladies  seeing the bridegroom follow the stranger in his  retreat  the meaning of which they did not comprehend  began to be  afraid of a quarrel  Emilia  upon pretence of that supposition  was so  much alarmed  that she could not stand  and was fain to have recourse
