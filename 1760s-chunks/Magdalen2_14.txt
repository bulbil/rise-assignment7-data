who by nature and inclination must be the readiest to rejoice at my felicity  or to participate in my distress—Yes  madam  I must own    80 in spite of all your judicious precautions  my heart was insensibly engaged  and I loved before I was aware that the colonel had any other place in my affections  than what was due to the brother of Louisa—You  madam  I am sure  must have seen  upon several occasions  what an awkward constraint I have laboured under when I have been in his company—Your penetration could not be eluded  though I then fondly thought nobody could see into my sentiments  and piqued myself upon the address with which I behaved in so very critical a situation   Indeed  the respectful tenderness with which the colonel all along treated me  contributed not a little to raise him in my esteem—Upon a thousand little occasions he gave me proof of his good opinion  though he never made me the most distant tendre of his heart  but   81 judging of his sentiments by my own  or possibly believing  because I wished it might be so  that he really saw me with more than a common degree of friendship  I suffered the flame imperceptibly to spread  and was solicitous only of concealing my weakness from his observation  but matters  madam  have  at last  come to something of a crisis  and I have the satisfaction of knowing that my tenderness is at least returned  whether I am ever blest with the object of it or not   The second day after the colonel s coming down wounded  before he was yet pronounced out of danger  he sent his compliments to me  and begged I would favour him with a visit  as he had something of importance to acquaint me with  The light in which I was considered by every body in the family  joined to the nature of his situation  would   82 have made it affectation to the last degree  had I not immediately complied with his request—I therefore went  and the attendants being ordered out of the room  he begged of me to seat myself close to the bedside  where  taking hold of my hand  and desiring I would not be offended at what he was going to say  he went on to the following purport   The distresses of my mind and the anguish of my wound  rendering my recovery extremely precarious  I have presumed  Miss Beauclerk  to beg your ear upon a subject  which  though very near my heart  I would not  for particular reasons  enter upon  was there a certainty either that medicine or time could do me any essential benefit  As it is therefore doubtful how long I may be in a capacity of delivering myself intelligibly  I have determined to seize the present opportunity   83 of opening my mind  since  was I to leave the world without telling you how dear you have always been to my soul  my parting moments would be imbittered with an anxiety that must render the natural gloominess of death inconceivably afflicting—O  Miss Beauclerk  from the first moment I beheld you  young as we both were  I loved you—Every day  as you rose into perfection  I felt an encrease of passion  though I strove to conceal my sentiments very carefully from the world  as I saw but too many difficulties in the way of our union  had I even merit enough to solicit with a likelihood of success  In short  madam  I found my father s ambition was utterly unfavourable to my hopes—And I saw that you had too much dignity of disposition to come into a family  that would look upon your alliance in a disagreeable light  or   84 shew a less regard to the invaluable requisites of beauty and virtue  than to the infinitely meaner circumstances of ancestry and fortune —These  madam  were the motives of my silence  and silence  however mortifying in my situation  was  at least  the most prudent part  if it was not the most generous  I have always looked with detestation on those men  who  though they were conscious of some family consideration that must prevent them from accepting the honour of a lady s hand  were nevertheless insolent enough  or cruel enough  to aim at engaging her affections—On these accounts  I say  madam  had I even reason to think you would have blest me with a reciprocal esteem  I had avoided the presumption  or the baseness  of a declaration  since  as there was no prospect of leading you into any certain state of felicity  it   85 would be infamy itself to think of plunging you into distress   O  mama  what a mind has this man —Here  however  he was obliged to rest himself a little  while the only reply I could make was with my tears   After a pause of some moments  he resumed the affecting subject  and thus continued his discourse—   I do not now  my ever adorable Miss Beauclerk  meanly intend  by an address to your generosity  to make any interest with your heart—Your esteem I should be proud of possessing  but thus hovering  as I may say  on the verge of eternity  I should be sorry  for your own sake  was
