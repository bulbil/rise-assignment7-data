it thus  you subdue me  Is it thus you convince me of my shameful littleness  I cannot bear it  All that this woman has done to me  is nothing to this  I can neither leave you  nor stay in your presence  Leave me  leave me  for six minutes only—Jesus  how shall I bear my own littleness   I arose  One word  only  my Lord  When I reenter  say not a syllable more on this subject  Let it pass as I put it  I would part with a greater sum than an hundred a year  for the satisfaction of giving to my uncle the tranquillity he has so long wanted in his own house  rather than that a person  who has had a dependence upon him  should think herself intitled to complain of injustice from him   He caught my hand  and would have met it with his lips  I withdrew it hastily  and retired  leaving him to recollect himself   When I returned  he thrust into my hand a paper  and held it there  and swore that I should take it  If the wretch live ten years  nephew  said she  that will reimburse you  if she die sooner  the difference is yours  And  for God s sake  for the sake of your mother s memory  don t despise me  that is all the favour I ask you  No man on earth was ever so nobly overcome  By all that s good  you shall chalk me out my path  Blessed be my sister s memory  for giving me such a kinsman  The name of Grandison  that I ever disliked till now  is the first of names  And may it be perpetuated to the end of time   He held the paper in my hand till he had done speaking  I then opened it  and found it to be a bank note of 1000 l  I was earnest to return it  but he swore so vehemently  that he would have it so  that I  at last  acquiesced  but declared  that I would pay the whole annuity  as far as the sum went  and this    81 as well in justice to him  as to save him the pain of attending to an affair that must be grievous to him  And I insisted upon giving him an acknowlegement under my hand  for that sum  and to be accountable to him for it  as his banker would in the like case   And thus ended this affair  The woman went away before me  She begged the favour  at the door  of one word with me  My Lord started up  at her voice  His complexion varied  He whipt as nimbly behind the door  as if he had no gout in his foot  I will not see her  said he   I stepped out  She complimented  thanked me  and wept  but  in the height of her concern  would have uttered bitter things against my Lord  But I stopped her mouth  by telling her  that I was to be her paymaster  quarterly  of the 250 l  a year  She turned her execrations  against her Lord  into blessings on me  But  after all  departed with reluctance   Pride  and not tenderness  was visibly the occasion  Could she have secured her whole annuity  she would have gratified that pride  by leaving her Lord in triumph while she thought her departure would have given him regret  But to be dismissed  was a disgrace that affected her  and gave bitterness to her insolent spirit   LETTER XI  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  To Dr  BARTLETT  In Continuation   MY Lord  tho  he had acquitted himself on the occasion  in such a manner as darted into my mind a little ray of my beloved mother s spirit  could not forbear giving way to his habitual littleness  when he was assured Giffard was out of the house  He called Halden to him  who entered with joy in his countenance  arising  as it came out  from the same occasion    82 and ordered him to make all his domestics happy for  what he meanly called  his deliverance  Asking  If there were any body in the house who loved her  Not a single soul  said Halden  and I am sure  that I may venture to congratulate your Lordship  in the names of all your servants  For she was proud  imperious  and indeed a tyranness to all beneath her   I then  for the first time  pitied the woman  and should have pitied her still more  true as this might  in some measure  be  had she not gone away so amply rewarded  For in this little family I looked forward to the family of the State  the Sovereign and his ministers  How often has a minister  who has made a tyrannical use of his power  and even some who have not  experienced  on his dismission  the like treatment  from those who  had they had his power  would perhaps have made as bad use of it  who  in its plenitude  were sawning  creeping slaves  as
