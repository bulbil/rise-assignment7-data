be as how the wench would swear the child to him  he would settle it with the parish  but declared  that no squire in the land should oblige him to buckle with such a cracked pitcher  This resolution  however  he could not maintain  for  in less than two hours the rector of the parish had direction to publish the banns  and the ceremony was performed in due course    Now  though we know not precisely the nature of the arguments that were used with the farmer  we may conclude they were of the minatory species  for the young fellow could not  for some time  look any person in the face    The knight acted as the general redresser of grievances  If a woman complained to him of being ill treated by her husband  he first inquired into the foundation of the complaint  and  if he found it just  catechised the defendant  If the warning had no effect  and the man proceeded to fresh acts of violence  then his judge took the execution of the law in his own hand  and horsewhipped the party  Thus he involved himself in several law suits  that drained him of pretty large sums of money  He seemed particularly incensed at the least appearance of oppression  and supported divers poor tenants against the extortion of their landlords  Nay  he has been known to travel two hundred miles as a volunteer  to offer his assistance in the cause of a person  who he heard was by chicanery and oppression wronged of a considerable estate  He accordingly took her under his protection  relieved her distresses  and was at a vast expense in bringing the suit to a determination  which being unfavourable to his client  he resolved to bring an appeal into the House of Lords  and certainly would have executed his purpose  if the gentlewoman had not died in the interim    At this period Ferret interrupted the narrator  by observing that the said Greaves was a common nuisance  and ought to be prosecuted on the statute of barratry    No  sir   resumed Mr  Clarke   he cannot be convicted of barratry  unless he is always at variance with some person or other  a mover of suits and quarrels  who disturbs the peace under colour of law  Therefore he is in the indictment styled  Communis malefactor  calumniator  et seminator litium     Pr ythee  truce with thy definitions   cried Ferret   and make an end to thy long winded story  Thou hast no title to be so tedious  until thou comest to have a coif in the Court of Common Pleas    Tom smiled contemptuous  and had just opened his mouth to proceed  when the company were disturbed by a hideous repetition of groans  that seemed to issue from the chamber in which the body of the squire was deposited  The landlady snatched the candle  and ran into the room  followed by the doctor and the rest  and this accident naturally suspended the narration  In like manner we shall conclude the chapter  that the reader may have time to breathe and digest what he has already heard             CHAPTER FIVE  IN WHICH THIS RECAPITULATION DRAWS TO A CLOSE   When the landlady entered the room from whence the groaning proceeded  she found the squire lying on his back  under the dominion of the nightmare  which rode him so hard that he not only groaned and snorted  but the sweat ran down his face in streams  The perturbation of his brain  occasioned by this pressure  and the fright he had lately undergone  gave rise to a very terrible dream  in which he fancied himself apprehended for a robbery  The horror of the gallows was strong upon him  when he was suddenly awaked by a violent shock from the doctor  and the company broke in upon his view  still perverted by fear  and bedimmed by slumber  His dream was now realised by a full persuasion that he was surrounded by the constable and his gang  The first object that presented itself to his disordered view was the figure of Ferret  who might very well have passed for the finisher of the law  against him  therefore  the first effort of his despair was directed  He started upon the floor  and seizing a certain utensil  that shall be nameless  launched it at the misanthrope with such violence  that had he not cautiously slipt his head aside  it is supposed that actual fire would have been produced from the collision of two such hard and solid substances  All future mischief was prevented by the strength and agility of Captain Crowe  who  springing upon the assailant  pinioned his arms to his sides  crying   O  dâ€”n ye  if you are for running a head  I ll soon bring you to your bearings    The squire  thus restrained  soon recollected himself  and gazing upon every individual in the apartment   Wounds   said he   I ve had an ugly dream  I thought  for all the world  they were carrying me to Newgate  and that there was Jack Ketch coom to vetch me before my taim    Ferret  who was the person he
