at length  finding his constitution decay  revealed the secret to my father  who in his will bequeathed one hundred pounds a year to this agreeable foundling  but  as they both died while I was abroad  and some of the memorandums touching this transaction probably were mislaid  I never till now could discover where or how my pretty cousin was situated  I shall recompense the good woman for her care and fidelity  and take pleasure in bringing this affair to a happy issue    The lovers were now overwhelmed with transports of joy and gratitude  and every countenance was lighted up with satisfaction  From this place to the habitation of Sir Launcelot  the bells were rung in every parish  and the corporation in their formalities congratulated him in every town through which he passed  About five miles from Greavesbury Hall he was met by above five thousand persons of both sexes and every age  dressed out in their gayest apparel  headed by Mr  Ralph Mattocks from Darnel Hill  and the rector from the knight s own parish  They were preceded by music of different kinds  ranged under a great variety of flags and ensigns  and the women  as well as the men  bedizened with fancy knots and marriage favours  At the end of the avenue  a select bevy of comely virgins arrayed in white  and a separate band of choice youths distinguished by garlands of laurel and holly interweaved  fell into the procession  and sung in chorus a rustic epithalamium composed by the curate  At the gate they were received by the venerable housekeeper  Mrs  Oakley  whose features were so brightened by the occasion  that with the first glance she made a conquest of the heart of Captain Crowe  and this connexion was improved afterwards into a legal conjunction   Meanwhile the houses of Greavesbury Hall and Darnel Hill were set open for the entertainment of all comers  and both echoed with the sounds of festivity  After the ceremony of giving and receiving visits had been performed by Sir Launcelot Greaves and his lady  Mr  Clarke was honoured with the hand of the agreeable Miss Dolly Greaves  and the captain was put in possession of his paternal estate  The perfect and uninterrupted felicity of the knight and his endearing consort  diffused itself through the whole adjacent country  as far as their example and influence could extend  They were admired  esteemed  and applauded by every person of taste  sentiment  and benevolence  at the same time beloved  revered  and almost adored by the common people  among whom they suffered not the merciless hand of indigence or misery to seize one single sacrifice   Ferret  at first  seemed to enjoy his easy circumstances  but the novelty of this situation soon wore off  and all his misanthropy returned  He could not bear to see his fellow creatures happy around him  and signified his disgust to Sir Launcelot  declaring his intention of returning to the metropolis  where he knew there would be always food sufficient for the ravenous appetite of his spleen  Before he departed  the knight made him partake of his bounty  though he could not make him taste of his happiness  which soon received a considerable addition in the birth of a son  destined to be the heir and representative of two worthy families  whose mutual animosity the union of his parents had so happily extinguished   THE END
