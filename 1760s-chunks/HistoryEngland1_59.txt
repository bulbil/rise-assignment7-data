her  from the tomb of a Knight buried in the church of Fierbois  She addressed the soldiers as a messenger from heaven  and assured them  that providence would strengthen their arms  She marched at their head  and delivered Orleans  routed the English wherever they opposed  prophesied that the King should be crowned at Rheims  and she herself assisted at the solemnity which she had foretold  She was present at the coronation  holding in her hand the standard under which she had been so often victorious   This chain of successes  and the dignity which his late coronation gave the French King  now entirely turned the scale in his favour  the English lost the kingdom by the same methods the French had lost it before  While Charles united his forces and proceeded with dispatch  they were quarrelling among themselves  and losing the seasons for success  In the midst of the King s good fortune  however  Joan of Arc  his brave champion  was taken prisoner  as she was protecting the rear of her men in a retreat  The joy of the English  upon this occasion  is not to be expressed  and the Duke of Bedford  their General  thought no method could be so proper to restore their lost courage  as to prosecute his prisoner for witchcraft  It is a disagreeable reflection upon human nature  that Judges almost ever determine on the side of authority  she was found guilty by several Bishops and the Doctors of the university of Paris  She was at first condemned as a sorceress and an heretic  and enjoined to live  by way of penance  upon bread and water  and to remain in prison   174 for life  Some time after  under colour of her relapsing  she was publicly burnt for a witch  Superstition adds virulence to the natural cruelty of mankind  and this cruel sentence served only to inflame the hatred between the contending powers  without mending the cause of the English  In vain the brave Talbot and his son strove to maintain the declining interest of the English in France  in the year 1437  the French King made his triumphant entry into Paris  and  in a sequel of thirteen years more  the English were entirely banished from France  They only were left in possession of Calais and Guienne  and lost for ever all the fruits of the victories of Cressy  Poictiers  and Agincourt  Such is the end of ambition  the only consequences of their conquests there were to deluge that kingdom with the blood of its slaughtered inhabitants  and their own   It may easily be supposed  that the losses of the English in France  and the divisions of their rulers at home  must raise factions  In this period of calamity  a new interest was revived  which seemed to have lain dormant in the times of prosperity and triumph  the Duke of York began to think of asserting his right to the crown  This nobleman was descended  by the mother s side  from Lionel  one of the sons of Edward III  The reigning King was descended from John of Ghaunt  a son of the same Edward  but younger than Lionel  thus the Duke of York s claim was prior to that of Henry  The ensign of the Duke was a white rose  that of Henry a red  This gave name to the two houses  whose contentions were now about to drench the kingdom with slaughter   The Duke of Suffolk and the Queen were now at the head of affairs  and managed all things with   175 unlimited authority  As he had made his way to power by the blood of Gloucester  he was resolved to establish himself by the usual resources of tyranny  by cruelty to his inferiors  and flattery to the Queen  This unjust and ill managed power first drew against him the opposition of the Duke of York  perhaps the cause of the public was the only motive for his first resistance  Almost every malecontent has some real  and some fictitious causes of complaint  he therefore had recourse to parliament  and accused the Duke of Suffolk as the source of all the nation s disgraces in France  This accusation might have been false  but the real motive  which was Suffolk s power  and the cruel use he made of it  was left unmentioned  although it was true The court  to content the people  condemned him to banishment  and he embarked in a little vessel to take his passage to France  but he could not escape his destiny  He was met in his passage by an English man of war  the Captain  having a mind to search the ship the Duke was in  and finding him there  ordered his head to be struck off without further delay  There is little in the transactions of these times to interest us on the side of either party  we see crimes continually to disgust us  and scarce a shining character or a virtue to animate the narrative   By the death of the Duke of Suffolk  his rival  of York  saw himself rid of a potent enemy  and found the discontents of the people against the administration daily increase  Among the insurrections of these unhappy times  was that headed by Jack Cade  who led a tumultuous body of forces to London
