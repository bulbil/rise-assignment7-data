conversed with would give counsel   in her favour       To be reduced from a state of opulence and respect to one of poverty    contempt  and wretchedness  is terrible indeed  but much more so when   accompanied with a consciousness of having deserved  by our vices and   ill conduct  all the misfortunes we complain of       Lady Mellasin having no pleasing reflection of having done her duty in   any one point of life  it would not have been strange if  thus destitute   of comfort from within  all succour from without  she had yielded   herself to the last despair       She  nevertheless  amidst all the distraction of her thoughts  still   continued to testify a resolution seldom to be found among women of her   abandoned principles  never departing from this maxim  that  in the   worst of events  nothing was to be neglected  On the third day she sent   Mrs  Prinks to wait upon Mr  Goodman for his answer  having experienced   the little effect her daughter s presence had produced       It is a thing well worth the observation of all degrees of people  that   the truly generous never keep long in suspense the persons they think   proper objects of their bounty  A favour that costs too much pains in   obtaining  loses great part of it s value  it palls upon the mind of the   receiver  and looks more like being extorted than bestowed       Mr  Cowley  though a man whose great merit  one would think  should have   set him above the necessity of making any request of a pecuniary nature    was certainly obliged  sometimes  to solicitations that were very   uneasy to him  and drew from him this emphatick exclamation             If there s a man  ye gods  I ought to hate        Attendance and dependance be his fate        It soon occurred to Mr  Goodman in what manner it would best become him   to act towards this unhappy woman  and also what conditions ought to be   stipulated on her part  He had been told  both by the lawyer and the two   Mr  Thoughtlesses  that it was his late uncle s intention that she   should not be left without a decent provision  and being willing to   conform  as much as possible  to all the desires of a person whom he had   always esteemed as a parent  he passed by the injury which  since his   death  she had attempted to do to himself  and  within the time he had   mentioned to Miss Flora  wrote an answer to the request in the following   terms             To Lady Mellasin Goodman            Madam            Though you cannot but be sensible that your late base attempt to        invalidate my dear uncle s will  excludes you from receiving any        benefit from it  yet  as I am determined  as far as in my power  to        make the example of that excellent man the rule of all my actions         I shall not carry my resentment  for the injustice you have done        me  beyond what he expressed for those much greater injuries he        sustained by your infidelity and ingratitude  It was not his        intention you should starve  nor is it my desire you should do so            I am willing  Madam  to allow you a pension of one hundred pounds        per annum  to be quarterly paid into whose hands soever you shall        think fit to appoint for that purpose  but it must be on condition        that you retire forthwith  and pass the whole remainder of your        days in some remote part of the kingdom  The farther you remove        from a town where your ill conduct has rendered you so obnoxious         the better            This  Madam  is what I insist upon  and is  indeed  no more than        what your own safety demands from you  A very strict search is        making after your accomplices  and if they  or any of them  shall        happen to be found  it will be in vain for you to flatter yourself
