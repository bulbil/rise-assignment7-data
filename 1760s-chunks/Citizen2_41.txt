misery of youth  disappointed ambition  that of manhood  and successless avarice  that of age  These three attack us through life  and it is our duty to stand upon our guard  To love  we ought to oppose dissipation  and endeavour to change the object of the affections  to ambition  the happiness of indolence and obscurity  and to avarice  the fear of soon dying  These are the shields with which we should arm ourselves  and thus make every scene of life  if not pleasing  at least supportable   Men complain of not finding a place of repose  They are in the wrong  they have it for seeking  What they should indeed complain of is  that the heart is an enemy to that very repose they seek  To themselves alone should they impute their discontent  They seek within the short span of life to satisfy a thousand desires  each of which alone is unsatiable  One month passes and another comes on  the year ends and then begins  but man is still unchanging in folly  still blindly continuing in prejudice  To the wise man  every climate and every soil is pleasing  to him a parterre of flowers is the famous valley of gold  to him  a little brook    125the fountain of the young peach trees   to such a man  the melody of birds is more ravishing than the harmony of a full concert  and the tincture of the cloud preferable to the touch of the finest pencil   The life of man is a journey  a journey that must be travelled  however bad the roads or the accommodation  If  in the beginning  it is found dangerous  narrow  and difficult  it must either grow better in the end  or we shall by custom learn to bear its inequality   But though I see you incapable of penetrating into grand principles  attend at least to a simile adapted to every apprehension  I am mounted upon a wretched ass  I see another man before me upon a sprightly horse  at which I find some uneasiness I look behind me and see numbers on foot stooping under heavy burdens  let me learn to pity their estate  and thank heaven for my own   Shingfu  when under misfortunes  would in the beginning weep like a child  but he soon recovered his former tranquility  After indulging grief for a few days  he would become  as usual  the most merry old man in all the province of Shansi  About the time that his wife died  his possessions were all consumed by fire  and his only son sold into captivity  Shingfu grieved for one day  and the next went to dance at a Mandarine s door for his dinner  The company were surprised to see the old man so merry when suffering such great losses  and the Mandarine himself coming out  asked him how   126 he  who had grieved so much  and given way to the calamity the day before  could now be so chearful   You ask me one question  cries the old man  let me answer by asking another  Which is the most durable  a hard thing  or a soft thing  that which resists  or that which makes no resistance   An hard thing to be sure  replied the Mandarine   There you are wrong  returned Shingfu  I am now fourscore years old  and if you look in my mouth you will find that I have lost all my teeth  but not a bit of my tongue    Adieu   LETTER XCIII  From Lien Chi Altangi  to Fum Hoam  first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin  in China   THE manner of grieving for our departed friends in China is very different from that of Europe  The mourning colour of Europe is black  that of China white  When a parent or relation dies here  for they seldom mourn for friends  it is only clapping on a suit of sables  grimacing it for a few days  and all  soon forgotten  goes on as before  not a single creature missing the deceased  except perhaps a favourite house keeper or a favourite cat   On the contrary  with us in China it is a very serious affair  The piety with which I have seen you behave on one of these occasions should never be forgotten  I remember it was upon the death of thy grandmother s maiden sister  The coffin was   127 exposed in the principal hall in public view  Before it were placed the figures of eunuchs  horses  tortoises  and other animals  in attitudes of grief and respect  The more distant relations of the old lady  and I among the number  came to pay our compliments of condolance  and to salute the deceased after the manner of our country  We had scarce presented our wax candles and perfumes  and given the howl of departure  when  crawling on his belly from under a curtain  out came the reverend Fum Hoam himself  in all the dismal solemnity of distress  Your looks were set for sorrow  your cloathing consisted in an hempen bag tied round the neck with a string  For two long months did this mourning continue  By night you lay stretched on a single mat
