of external successes also assisted to persuade us in   those days that felicity was to be attained and ascertained upon   earth  The regency of Cromwell was administered with the   strictest justice at home  while at the same time it became re    vered and formidable abroad  and extended its influence to regions   the most remote  Under the protection of the British flag we   sent our ships out to the east and to the west  and wealth came   pouring in upon us from all quarters of the globe      In the mean while  my wife and I lived together in perfect   harmony  Though my commerce and acquaintance was greatly   extended  I had yet formed no friendships from home that par    took of heartfelt tenderness  except for your mamma  All my   pleasures and desires all my world was  in a manner  confined   and absorbed within the compass of my own walls  In the good   old man and his daughter  and in the pledges of their endearing   attachment to me  every wish that my soul could form was   centred  Mutual joy sat round our board mutual peace pre    pared our pillows  and  during a swimming period of six years    I scarce remember to have experienced the smallest discontent    save what arose from the inordinancy of my wife s affection for me      While she continued to bless my arms  I thought that no one   had ever loved with greater warmth than I loved her   and yet    at times  I remarked a very striking difference between the manner   and effects of our feelings for each other  If business detained   me an hour extraordinary abroad  the panting of her bosom  that   eagerness of look with which she received me  was to me a painful   evidence of her anxiety during my absence  One evening I found   her in fainting fits  merely because she was told that a duel had   just happened between Lord Mohun and a person who had much   the resemblance of her Clinton  In short  if my head or my finger   ached I found myself under the necessity of concealing my ailment    and of assuming a cheerfulness disagreeable to the occasion  to         198 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      prevent the worse consequences of her ready alarms  On the   other hand  my affection was tranquil and serene   it was tender   and fervent  indeed  but without tumult or disturbance a species   of love which I afterwards found to be by far the most eligible     for every kind of passion is unquestionably a kind of suffering    love in God  therefore  must be wholly an action it acts infinitely   upon others without any possibility of being acted upon      Thus the years of my life moved onward upon down  when the   small pox  that capital enemy to youth and beauty  became epi    demical in the city  Our children caught the contagion  All   possible care was taken  and all possible art employed  A number   of physicians was kept constantly about them  Fifteen days of   their illness were already elapsed  and the doctors pronounced   them out of danger  when the distemper took a sudden and ma    lignant turn  and in one and the same minute both my babes ex    pired in the arms of their mother      I was in the room at the time  and as I knew the extreme   tenderness of my Matty s nature  all my concern as well as   attention was turned upon her  I took her fondly by the hand    and  looking up to her face  I was instantly alarmed and shocked   by that placid serenity which appeared in her countenance  and   which I expected to be quickly changed into some frantic eruption    But first dropping a smiling tear on her infants  and then lifting   her glistening eyes to heaven I thank thee I thank thee  my   Master   she cried   thou hast made me of some use   I have not   been born in vain  thou hast ordained me the humble vehicle   of two safe and certain angels living attendants on thy throne   and sweet singers of thy praises in the kingdom of little children   for ever and for ever  I have yet sufficient left more blessings re    maining than suit the lot of mortality take me from them  I   beseech thee  whenever it is thy good pleasure   for I fear there   are some of them which I could not bear to have taken away from   me   So prayed the dear saint  and looking eagerly at me No  my   Harry  she cried out  I fear  I fear I could not bear it   So saying
