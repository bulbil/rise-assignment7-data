of death  or removal by promotion  of Father Marescotti  whose merits must at last render him conspicuous  to choose her own confessor  But that her Father and Mother shall have their negative preserved to them  in either case  while she continues in their palace  Nor will the dear Lady think this a hardship  for she wishes not to be independent on parents  of whose indulgent goodness to her she is most dutifully sensible  and it is reasonable  that they should be judges of the conduct of every one who is to be a domestic in their family   IV  As Lady Clementina  from some late unhappy circumstances  thinks she cannot marry any man  and as a late extraordinary step taken by her  has shewn  that there is at present too much reason to attend to the weight of her plea  it is hoped  that the Count of Belvedere  for his own sake  for the sake of the composure of mind of the Lady  so dear to all who have the honour of knowing her  will resolve to discontinue his addresses to her  and engage never to think of resuming them  unless some hopes   171 should arise  in course of time  of his succeeding in her favour by her own consent   V  Her ever honoured parents  for themselves and for their absent brother the Count of Porretta  her right reverend brother for himself  and  as far as he may  for his elder brother  Signor Jeronymo for himself  will be so good as to promise  that they will never with earnestness endeavour to persuade  much less to compel  Lady Clementina to marry any man whatever  nor encourage her Camilla  or any other friend or confident  to endeavour to prevail upon her to change her condition  Her parents  however  reserving to themselves the right of proposing  as they shall think fit  but not of urging  because the young Lady  who is by nature sweettempered  gentle  obliging  dutiful  thinks herself  however determined by inclination  less able to withstand the persuasions of indulgent friends  than she should be to resist the most despotic commands   VI  These terms conceded to  on all sides  it is humbly proposed  that the young Lady shall throw herself  as she is impatient to do  at the feet of her indulgent parents  and that all acts of disobligation shall be buried in everlasting oblivion   The proposer of the above six articles takes the liberty to add  on the presumption that they may be carried into effect  that his noble guests will allow him to rejoice with them on their mutual happiness restored  for months to come  in his native country   He hopes that they will accept of his endeavours to make England as agreeable to them  as they heretofore made Italy to him   He begs that they will consider their family and his    172 as one family  ever to be united by the indissoluble ties of true friendly Love   He hopes for their company at his country seat   He will seek for opportunities to oblige and accommodate them in every article  whether devotional or domestic   And when they will be no longer prevailed upon to stay in England  he will  no accidents  no events  preventing  of which themselves shall be judges  attend them to Italy  and if his beloved Wife and Sisters  and their Lords  shall have made to themselves  as he hopes they will  an interest in their affections  he questions not to prevail on them to be of the party   CH  GRANDISON   Monday morn  ten o clock   SIR Charles is gone to attend the Count at his Lodgings  in pursuance of his request signified by a note last night   Two o clock   THE following Billet is just now brought me   MY dearest Love will have the goodness to excuse my dining with her this day  Signor Marsigli  and her Ever devoted  are hastening to Grosvenor Square  where we shall dine  This worthy nobleman deserves pity  Adieu  my dearest Life   CH  GRANDISON   I am all impatience for the issue of these conferences  But I will not dine by myself  when I can sit down at table with Lady L  and Lady Clementina at Lord L s—and with my Lord himself  so much my brother and friend  Here therefore will I close this Letter  Forgive  my ever honoured grandmamma  the abruptness of  Your ever dutiful HARRIET GRANDISON     173  LETTER XXXVII  Lady GRANDISON  In Continuation   Monday  March 26   LADY L  when I was set down at her house  told me  that Lady Clementina had been in great agitations on the contents of the proposals left with her  She kept her chamber all day yesterday  and this morning  Lady L  had then but just left her  I sent up my compliments to her  She desired me to walk up  She met me on the stair head in tears  and led me into her dressing room—Have you seen the Chevalier s proposals  madam —I owned I had   —Give up for ever  said she  my scheme  my darling scheme
