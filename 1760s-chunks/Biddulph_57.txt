dear little babes with me  but methinks two country houses are an unnecessary charge  and more than suits our fortune  I pray God this tender husband may not have a strong and prudent reason for this conduct  which out of kindness he conceals  perhaps he thinks this little spot at South park may some time hence be the whole of our dependence  and he has a mind to be before hand with ill fortune  in rendering that retreat agreeable to me  and rather an object of choice than of necessity  If this be his motive  How much am I obliged to him  He has not hinted any thing like it  nor would I dash the pleasure he seems to promise himself there  by insinuating the least suspicion of what his reasons are for going to it  If we lose Arnold abbey  and the whole estate belonging to it  I shall only regret it for his sake   July 8  We are to set out to morrow  my Cecilia  for our place in Kent  I have made the best apology that I could to my mother  and Mr Arnold too has writ to her  but I know she will be extremely disappointed at not seeing us   July 12  We are lately arrived at South park  Mr Arnold in high spirits  and my two young travellers bore the fatigue extremely well   I am not surprized Mr Arnold liked the old family seat better than this  I cannot say I am much charmed with it  but I will not let him see that  I affect to admire  and seem pleased with every thing that affords me the least opportunity of commendation  The house is a very neat one  it has not been many years built  and is in perfectly good repair  It is genteely  though plainly furnished  and we have a tolerable garden  but as the whole domain is let  we are obliged to take a few fields from one of our tenants  to supply our immediate want  We are in a very genteel and populous neighbourhood  and within a mile of a good market town     July 20  I have regretted nothing so much in my absence from Arnold abbey  as the being cut off from the hope of seeing my amiable Mrs Vere  We can have but one friend to share our heart  to whom we have no reserve  and whose loss is irreparable  but I perceive the absence of a pleasing acquaintance  whose society is no farther necessary to us  than as it contributes to enliven solitude  and gets a preference to others merely by comparison  is a loss easily supplied  this I find by experience  There are Mrs Veres every where  but  alas  there is but one Cecilia   I was visited today by two ladies that I am charmed with  though it is the first time I have seen either of them  The one is lady V of whom you have formerly heard  Her Lord and she came together  their seat is within a mile of us  and Mr Arnold had a slight acquaintance with lord V before  My lady is about forty  and has that kind of countenance that at once invites your confidence  I never saw integrity  benevolence  and good sense  more strongly pictured in a face  her address is so plain  so perfectly free from affectation  or any of the little supercilious forms of ceremony  that a person  ignorant of what true politeness consists in  would imagine she wanted breeding  yet she received her education in a court  but she seems to let good sense and good nature preside over all her words and actions rather than form  She told me she had deferred her visit to me  longer perhaps than the laws of decorum would admit of  as we were such near neighbours  but  said she  I was determined not to be overlooked in the crowd of visitors that have been thronging to you every day  since you came down  The character I have heard of you  makes me wish for an intimacy with you  and you are not to look upon this as a visit of ceremony  but as an advance towards that friendship I wish to cultivate   She spoke this with so frank an air  that  flattering as the compliment appeared  I could not help believing her sincere  and thought myself  that my appearance did not diminish that good opinion which she said she had conceived of me from report   Lord V—— is many years older than his lady  a robust man  as plain in his way as my lady is in her’s  though his way and her’s are very different  for he is frank even to bluntness  but the best humoured man living   The other lady whom I mentioned is a widow  her name is    Gerrarde  and she lives upon a little estate she has in this neighbourhood  I think I never beheld so fine a creature  she is about six and twenty  her stature  which is much above the common size  is rendered perfectly graceful and majestic by one of the finest shapes in the world  if her face is not altogether so regularly beautiful as her person  it is  however  handsome enough to render any
