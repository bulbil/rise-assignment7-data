the art of picture buying at Paris      With this proposal I very readily closed  as it was a living  and now all my ambition was to live  I went therefore to his lodgings  improved my dress by his assistance  and after some time  accompanied him to auctions of pictures  where the English gentry were expected to be purchasers  I was not a little surprised at his intimacy with people of the  Page  28  best fashion  who referred themselves to his judgment upon every picture or medal  as to an unerring standard of taste  He made very good use of my assistance upon these occasions  for when asked his opinion  he would gravely take me aside  and ask mine  shrug  look wise  return  and assure the company  that he could give no opinion upon an affair of so much importance  Yet there was sometimes an occasion for a more supported assurance  I remember to have seen him  after giving his opinion that the colouring of a picture was not mellow enough  very deliberately take a brush with brown varnish  that was accidentally lying in the place  and rub it over the piece with great composure before all the company  and then ask if he had not improved the tints      When he had finished his commission in Paris  he left me strongly recommended  Page  29  to several men of distinction  as a person very proper for a travelling tutor  and I was after some time employed in that capacity by a gentleman who brought his ward to Paris  in order to set him forward on his tour through Europe  I was to be the young gentleman s governor  with this injunction  that he should always be permitted to direct himself  My pupil in fact understood the art of guiding in money concerns much better than me  He was heir to a fortune of about two hundred thousand pounds  left him by an uncle in the West Indies  and his guardians  to qualify him for the management of it  had bound him apprentice to an attorney  Thus avarice was his prevailing passion  all his questions on the road were how money might be saved  which was the least expensive course of travel  whether any thing could be bought that would turn to account when disposed of again in London   Page  30  Such curiosities on the way as could be seen for nothing he was ready enough to look at  but if the sight was to be paid for  he usually asserted that he had been told it was not worth seeing  He never paid a bill  that he would not observe  how amazingly expensive travelling was  and all this though he was not yet come to the age of twenty one  When arrived at Leghorn  as we took a walk to look at the port and shipping  he enquired the expence of the passage by sea home to England  This he was informed was but a trifle  compared to his returning by land  he was therefore unable to withstand the temptation  so paying me the small part of my salary that was then due  he took leave  and embarked with only one attendant for London      I now therefore was left once more upon the world at large  but then it was  Page  31  a thing I was used to  However my skill in music could avail me nothing in a country where every peasant was a better musician than I  but by this time I had acquired another talent  which answered my purpose as well  and this was a skill in disputation  In all the foreign universities and convents  there are upon certain days philosophical theses maintained against every adventitious disputant  for which  if the champion opposes with any dexterity  he can claim a gratuity in money  a dinner  and a bed for one night  In this manner therefore I fought my way towards England  walked along from city to city  examined mankind more nearly  and  if I may so express it  saw both sides of the picture  My remarks  however  were few  I found that monarchy was the best government for the poor to live in  and commonwealths for the rich  I found that riches in general were in every country another  Page  32  name for freedom  and that no man is so sond of freedom himself that he would not chuse to subject the will of some individuals of society to his own      Upon my arrival in England  I resolved to pay my respects first to you  and then to enlist as a volunteer in the first expedition that was sent out  but on my journey down my resolutions were changed  by meeting an old acquaintace  who I found belonged to a company of comedians  that were going to make a summer campaign in the country  The company seemed not much to disapprove of me for an associate  They all  however  apprized me of the importance of the task at which I aimed  that the public was a many headed monster  and that only such as had very good heads could please it  that acting was not to be learnt in a day  and that without some traditional
