broke into a violent fit of laughter No  no   master    said he  there s nothing for any one to pay in this house  I   assure you  Mynheer never troubles himself about those matters     his major domo pays all   ay  and for many a guest too that happens   to be in the same inn with his master      Why  pray  said I  is he a lord   A lord  quotha   not so little as   that comes to neither  No  sir   he is a prince the very prince of   our merchants   and our merchants are princes above all lords    And  pray  how do they style or call him   He has many names and   titles  When our traders speak of him  they call him Mynheer   Van Glunthong   but others style him my lord of merchants  and   others my lord the brother man  and my lord the friend of the poor      The remainder of my story is very short  and still more insipni    ficiint  I soon set out for Fn dand  in order to file a bill against my   uncle  and compel him to discover what patrimony my falhor had   left me  But God was please 1  in the moan space  to cut ofi all de    bate   his wife and child had died of an epidemic distemper  an t he   did not survive them above a fortnight  He left me a penitential         362 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      letter  with a small will enclosed  whereby I became entitled to   three hundred a year in right of my father  and an additional four   hundred in right of my uncle  with a sum of near three thousand   pounds in ready money      If I know my own heart  the only cause of rejoicing that I felt   on that occasion was  that it put it in my power to discharge my   pecuniary obligations to my late generous preserver  I immediately   wrote and transmitted bills to Holland for the purpose   but the   bills were returned  and I could hear no tidings concerning the   residence of my patron  I then put out his 1400 on the best   securities that I could procure  It is now close upon five and    thirty years since I saw him   and in that time the principal  with   interest upon interest  yearly turned into capital  has amounted to   nearly 5000  one penny of which I never touch  but hold the   whole as sacred      Mean time  it has cost me hundreds upon hundreds in cor    respondences  advertisements  and even in special messengers to   several parts of Europe  to discover where this greatest  this most   eminent of men could have concealed himself  but  alas  my   search proved as fruitless as that of the miser in hunting after the   pearl of mighty price      During those five and thirty years  the image of the persons of   those my two gracious patrons never left my memory were ever   at my heart  Ah   I would say to myself  they are dead they are   dead   or  rapt  perhaps  like Elijah  alive into heaven   flesh and   blood refined as theirs might easily pass from its little impurities    through the fire of the love of God to the place of its bliss  And   again  it was my daily and ardent petition that  if their mortal   was not swallowed up of immortality  I might once set my eyes   upon them before I died      Here Mr  Meekly ended  I thank you  my dear friend  said the   earl  for your history   it has entertained me most pleasingly  and   I have also been highly edified by some passages in it  But  with   respect to the glimpse that you had of your two wonderful friends    I think it must have been a vision  or merely a matter of imagina    tion   for I never saw in nature  nor read in fiction  of any thing   comparable to the excellences that you have described in that   exalted pair  If it was a vision  my lord it must have been one   of blessed angels indeed   but I hope you will allow that the bene    fits which they conferred were no way visionary  O Mr  Meekly     said Harry  with a sigh  the picture that you have drawn of this   dear lady has almost given me a distaste to all the rest of her sex    Ah  might I meet hereafter some daughter some descendant   some distant likeness of her how happy
