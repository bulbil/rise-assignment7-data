there now  when they are all there    because of their fleers at him and me  Otherwise I should be glad to   see the poor gentleman  for  indeed  I think him a good man  and he has   suffered for my sake          So  I am sent for down to cards  I ll go  but wish I may continue their   good opinions of me  for I shall be very awkward  My master  by his   serious question  and bidding me guard my heart against surprises    though I should see  when I came down  a man he can allow me to love   dearly  though hardly better than himself  has quite alarmed me  and   made me sad   I hope he loves me   But whether he does or not  I am in   for it now  over head and ears  I doubt  and can t help loving him   tis   a folly to deny it  But to be sure I can t love any man preferably to   him  I shall soon know what he means          Now  my dear mother  must I write to you  Well might my good master say   so mysteriously as he did  about guarding my heart against surprises  I   never was so surprised in my life  and never could see a man I loved   so dearly   O my dear mother  it was my dear  dear father  and not Mr    Williams  that was below ready to receive and to bless your daughter    and both my master and he enjoined me to write how the whole matter was    and what my thoughts were on this joyful occasion       I will take the matter from the beginning  that Providence directed his   feet to this house  to this time  as I have had it from Mrs  Jewkes    from my master  my father  the ladies  and my own heart and conduct  as   far as I know of both  because they command it  and you will be pleased   with my relation and so  as you know how I came by the connexion  will   make one uniform relation of it       It seems  then  my dear father and you were so uneasy to know the truth   of the story which Thomas had told you  that fearing I was betrayed  and   quite undone  he got leave of absence  and set out the day after Thomas   was there  and so  on Friday morning  he got to the neighbouring town    and there he heard  that the gentry in the neighbourhood were at   my master s  at a great entertainment  He put on a clean shirt and   neckcloth  which he brought in his pocket  at an alehouse there  and got   shaved  and so  after he had eaten some bread and cheese  and drank   a can of ale  he set out for my master s house  with a heavy heart    dreading for me  and in much fear of being brow beaten  He had  it   seems  asked  at the alehouse  what family the  squire had down here  in   hopes to hear something of me  And they said  A housekeeper  two maids    and  at present  two coachmen  and two grooms  a footman  and a helper    Was that all  he said  They told him  there was a young creature there    belike who was  or was to be  his mistress  or somewhat of that nature    but had been his mother s waiting maid  This  he said  grieved his   heart  and confirmed his fears       So he went on  and about three o clock in the afternoon came to the   gate  and  ringing there  Sir Simon s coachman went to the iron gate    and he asked for the housekeeper  though  from what I had written  in   his heart he could not abide her  She sent for him in  little thinking   who he was  and asked him  in the little hall  what his business with   her was   Only  madam  said he  whether I cannot speak one word with the    squire  No  friend  said she  he is engaged with several gentlemen and   ladies  Said he  I have business with his honour of greater consequence   to me than either life or death  and tears stood in his eyes       At that she went into the great parlour  where my master was talking   very pleasantly with the ladies  and she said  Sir  here is a good tight   old man  that wants to see you on business of life and death
