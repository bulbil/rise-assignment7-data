such pathetic vows and artful adulation  as well might captivate  a young woman of my complexion and experience  and circumstanced as I  was  with a husband whom I had such reason to despise    Though he thus made an insensible progress in my heart  he did not find  my virtue an easy conquest  and I myself was ignorant of the advantage  he had gained with regard to my inclinations  until I was convinced of  his success by an alarm of jealousy which I one day felt  at seeing him    6 22 15  3 45 PM   engaged in conversation with another lady  I forthwith recognized this  symptom of love  with which I had been formerly acquainted  and trembled  at the discovery of my own weakness  I underwent a strange agitation  and mixture of contrary sensations  I was pleased with the passion   yet ashamed of avowing it even to my own mind  The rights of a husband   though mine was but a nominal one  occurred to my reflection  and  virtue  modesty  and honour  forbade me to cherish the guilty flame    When I encouraged these laudable scruples  and resolved to sacrifice  my love to duty and reputation  my lord was almost every day employed  in riding post to my father  with complaints of my conduct  which  was hitherto irreproachable  though the greatest grievance which he  pretended to have suffered was my refusing to comply with his desire   when he entreated me to lie  a whole hour every morning  with my neck  uncovered  that  by gazing  he might quiet the perturbation of his  spirits  From this request you may judge of the man  as well as of the  regard I must entertain for his character and disposition    During the whole summer I was besieged by my artful undoer  and in the  autumn set out with my lord for Bath  where  by reason of the intimacy  that subsisted between our families  we lived in the same house with  my lover and his sister  who  with another agreeable young lady   accompanied us in this expedition  By this time Mr  S   had extorted  from me a confession of a mutual flame  though I assured him that  it should never induce me to give up the valuable possession of an  unspotted character  and a conscience void of offence  I offered him  all the enjoyment he could reap from an unreserved intercourse of souls   abstracted from any sensual consideration  He eagerly embraced the  platonic proposal  because he had sagacity enough to foresee the issue  of such chimerical contracts  and knew me too well to think he could  accomplish his purpose without seeming to acquiesce in my own terms  and  cultivating my tenderness under the specious pretext    In consequence of this agreement  we took all opportunities of seeing  each other in private  and these interviews were spent in mutual  protestations of disinterested love  This correspondence  though  dangerous  was  on my side  equally innocent and endearing  and many  happy hours we passed  before my sentiments were discovered  At length  my lover was taken ill  and then my passion burst out beyond the  power of concealment  my grief and anxiety became so conspicuous in my  countenance  and my behaviour was so indiscreet  that everybody in the  house perceived the situation of my thoughts  and blamed my conduct  accordingly    Certain it is  I was extremely imprudent  though intentionally  innocent  I have lain whole nights by my lord  who teased and tormented  me for that which neither I could give nor he could take  and ruminated  on the fatal consequences of this unhappy flame  until I was worked into  a fever of disquiet  I saw there was no safety but in flight  and often  determined to banish myself for ever from the sight of this dangerous  intruder  But my resolution always failed at the approach of day  and  my desire of seeing him as constantly recurred  So far was I from  persisting in such commendable determinations  that  on the eve of  our departure from Bath  I felt the keenest pangs of sorrow at  our approaching separation  and  as we could not enjoy our private  interviews at my house in town  I promised to visit him at his own  apartments  after he had sworn by all that s sacred  that he would    6 22 15  3 45 PM   take no sinister advantage of my condescension  by presuming upon the  opportunities I should give    He kept his word  for he saw I trusted to it with fear and trembling   and perceived that my apprehension was not affected  but the natural  concern of a young creature  distracted between love and duty  whom  had  he alarmed  he would never had seen within his doors again  Instead of  pressing me with solicitations in favour of his passion  he was more  than ever respectful and complaisant  so that I found myself disengaged  of all restraint  conducted the conversation  shortened and repeated my
