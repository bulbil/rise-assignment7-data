s  it is   not to be wondered at  that she imagined him wholly disengaged since the   death of that lady who had so kindly remembered him in her will       Neither ought it  her vanity considered  to appear strange  that she was   apt to flatter herself with a return of his affection to herself  when   the memory of the late object of it should be utterly erased       When there is the least possibility that what we ardently wish may come   to pass  the minutest circumstance  in favour of our hopes  serves to   assure us that it certainly will do so       Miss Betsy was going to make a visit at Whitehall  but  in crossing the   Park  happened to meet the two Miss Airishes  who asked her to take a   turn with them  to which she replied  that she would gladly accompany   them  but had sent word to a lady that she was coming to pass the whole   evening with her   Nay   said the elder Miss Airish   we have an   engagement too at our own apartment  and can stay only to walk once up   the Mall  and down again   Miss Betsy replied  that would be no great   loss of time  and so went with them  They had not proceeded many yards   in their promenade  before Miss Betsy saw Mr  Trueworth  with Sir Bazil    coming directly towards them  The gentlemen bowed to her as they   approached more near  A sudden thought that moment darting into Miss   Betsy s head  she dropped her fan  as if by accident  as they were   passing each other  just at Mr  Trueworth s feet  he stopped hastily to   take it up  and presented it hastily to her   I am sorry  Sir   said   she   to give you this trouble     Whatever services  Madam  are in my   power   replied he   will be always a pleasure to myself    No more was   said  the gentlemen and the ladies pursued their different routs  This   little adventure  however  had a prodigious effect on Miss Betsy  she   thought she saw something so gay and sparkling in the eyes of Mr    Trueworth  as denoted his mourning habit belied his heart  and that he   was not much affected with the death of her for whom decency and   gratitude had obliged him to put it on  After the gentlemen were out of   hearing  the two Miss Airishes began to give their judgments upon   them  the one cried  they both were very pretty fellows  but the other   accused them of want of politeness    As they saw we had no man with   us   said she   they might  methinks  have offered their service to   gallant us  especially as one of them seems to be acquainted with Miss   Betsy   But that young lady little regarded what was said on the   occasion  being too much taken up with her own cogitations  she repeated   internally the words of Mr  Trueworth  and as she was persuaded he was   now at liberty to offer her all manner of services  she interpreted    that by whatever services were in his power  he meant to renew his   services to her as a lover  This imagination elated her to a very high   degree  but hindered her from holding any conversation with the two   ladies she was with  as it was improper for her to say any thing on the   subject which so much engrossed her thoughts  They all walked together   up to Buckingham House  then turned back  and the two Miss Airishes took   leave of her at St  James s  they went into the Palace  and she was   proceeding towards Spring Garden  when she at a distance perceived Sir   Bazil Loveit  Mr  Trueworth  Miss Mabel  and two ladies  whose faces she   was entirely unacquainted with       The reader will not be at a loss to guess  that these two were no other   than Mrs  Wellair and Miss Harriot  they had been that afternoon to take   leave of some friends  and had appointed to meet the gentlemen in the   Mall  in their way thither they had called upon Miss Mabel  and brought   her with them  This little troop being all in the same sable livery    seemed so much of a family  as threw Miss Betsy into some sort of   surprize  she knew not that Miss Mabel had the least acquaintance with   Sir Bazil  nor even any more with Mr  Trueworth than having seen him a   few times in her company  As they drew nearer  she made a motion to Miss   Mabel  as if she was desirous
