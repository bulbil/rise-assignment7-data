for I maintained with Whiston  that it was unlawful for a priest of the church of England  after the death of his first wife  to take a second  or to express it in one word  I valued myself upon being a strict monogamist   I was early innitiated into this important dispute  on which so many laborious volumes have been written  I published some tracts upon the subject myself  which  as they never sold  I have the consolation of thinking are read only by the happy Few  Some of my friends called this my weak side  but alas  they had not like me made it the subject of long contemplation  The more I reflected upon it  the more  Page  11  important it appeared  I even went a step beyond Whiston in displaying my principles  as he had engraven upon his wife s tomb that she was the onlywife of William Whiston  so I wrote a similar epitaph for my wife  though still living  in which I extolled her prudence  oeconomy  and obedience till death  and having got it copied fair  with an elegant frame  it was placed over the chimney piece  where it answered several very useful purposes  It admonished my wife of her duty to me  and my fidelity to her  it inspired her with a passion for fame  and constantly put her in mind of her end   It was thus  perhaps  from hearing marriage so often recommended  that my eldest son  just upon leaving college  fixed his affections upon the daughter of a neighbouring clergyman  who was a dignitary in the church  and in circumstances to give her a large fortune  but fortune was her smallest accomplishment  Miss Arabella Wilmot was allowed by all  except my two daughters  to be completely  Page  12  pretty  Her youth  health  and innocence  were still heightened by a complexion so transparent  and such an happy sensibility of look  that even age could not gaze with indifference  As Mr  Wilmot knew that I could make a very handsome settlement on my son  he was not averse to the match  so both families lived together in all that harmony which generally precedes an expected alliance  Being convinced by experience that the days of courtship are the most happy of our lives  I was willing enough to lengthen the period  and the various amusements which the young couple every day shared in each other s company  seemed to encrease their passion  We were generally awaked in the morning by music  and on fine days rode a hunting  The hours between breakfast and dinner the ladies devoted to dress and study  they usually read a page  and then gazed at themselves in the glass  which even philosophers might own often presented the page of greatest beauty  At dinner my wife took the lead  for as she always insisted upon carving every thing herself  it  Page  13  being her mother s way  she gave us upon these occasions the history of every dish  When we had dined  to prevent the ladies leaving us  I generally ordered the table to be removed  and sometimes  with the music master s assistance  the girls would give us a very agreeable concert  Walking out  drinking tea  country dances  and forfeits  shortened the rest of the day  without the assistance of cards  as I hated all manner of gaming  except backgammon  at which my old friend and I sometimes took a two penny hit  Nor can I here pass over an ominous circumstance that happened the last time we played together  I only wanted to fling a quatre  and yet I threw deuce ace five times running   Some months were elapsed in this manner  till at last it was thought convenient to fix a day for the nuptials of the young couple  who seemed earnestly to desire it  During the preparations for the wedding  I need not describe the busy importance of my wife  nor the sly looks of my daughters  in fact  my attention was fixed on  Page  14  another object  the completing a tract which I intended shortly to publish in defence of monogamy  As I looked upon this as a master piece both for argument and style  I could not in the pride of my heart avoid shewing it to my old friend Mr  Wilmot  as I made no doubt of receiving his approbation  but too late I discovered that he was most violently attached to the contrary opinion  and with good reason  for he was at that time actually courting a fourth wife  This  as may be expected  produced a dispute attended with some acrimony  which threatened to interrupt our intended alliance  but on the day before that appointed for the ceremony  we agreed to discuss the subject at large   It was managed with proper spirit on both sides  he asserted that I was heterodox  I retorted the charge  he replied  and I rejoined  In the mean time  while the controversy was hottest  I was called out by one of my relations  who  with a face of concern  advised me to give up the dispute  and allow the old gentleman to be a 〈1  pages missing〉  Page  15  if he could  at least till
