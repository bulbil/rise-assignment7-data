  Odo  his own uncle  was the first to dispute his title  but he was soon taken prisoner  and  some time after  contrived means of flying into Normandy  where he found protection and honour from Duke Robert  This was a sufficient pretext for William to make war upon his brother  it was carried on with vigour and success  Henry  the third brother  was also involved in this war  separately  and upon his own account  having taken up arms for not being paid those treasures bequeathed him by his father  Thus were there three different armies  each exasperated against the other  and each led on by one of those disunited brothers  Such an unnatural contest  as my easily be conceived  served only to weaken themselves  and strengthen their enemies  The Scotch and Welch  therefore  took this opportunity to make several incursions upon the English  while William was thus pursuing conquests that could end neither in advantage nor fame  To increase the confusion  the clergy loudly complained of incroachments upon their privileges  the people murmured at every increase of their taxes  Robert de Mowbray was actually taken prisoner  while he commanded a fortress that had shaken off the royal authority    70 What effects these discontents  which were increased also by the King s avarice  intemperance  and prodigality  might have produced  is uncertain  the most melancholy were expected  but now the attention of all Europe was called off to one of the most remarkable events that history can produce  I mean the arming for the first Crusade   Peter  sirnamed the Hermit  who had beheld  with indignation  the cruel manner in which the Infidels  who were in possession of the Holy Sepulchre  treated the Christians who went on pilgrimages thither  returned to Europe  resolved to inspire the Princes of Christendom with a zeal for its recovery  Bareheaded and barefoot  he travelled from court to court  preaching  as he went  and inflaming the zeal of every rank of people  Pope Urban II  preached the Crusade himself at the council of Clermont  and numberless persons  of all degrees and nations  ardently embraced the cause  and put on the red cross  the badge of their profession  Among this number was Robert  Duke of Normandy  he was brave  zealous  fond of glory  and still more fond of change  In order to supply money to defray the necessary charges of so expensive an undertaking  he offered to mortgage his dukedom with his brother  for a stipulated sum  William eagerly embraced the proposal  he was no way sollicitous about raising the money agreed on  for he knew the riches of his clergy  heedless  therefore  of their murmurs  he rigorously levied the whole  making use of the most pious pretences to cover his extortion  Thus  sending his brother to the Holy Land  he took peaceable possession of his dukedom   In this manner was Normandy again united to the English crown  and from this union afterwards   71 arose those wars with France  which for whole centuries continued to depopulate both nations  without conducing in the end to the inriching of either   William was not a little pleased with this unexpected acquisition  and  as one success only produces a desire of more  he began to conceive more extensive schemes of ambition  Poictou and Guienne were offered to be mortgaged for the same reasons as Normandy  William immediately raised the necessary sum  but death interrupted the payment  Happening to hunt in that forest  from whence his father had banished the husbandman and legal possessor  he was accidentally shot thro  the heart  with an arrow  by one Tyrrel  he died in the forty fourth year of his age  reigned twelve  and left a dominion which he had contributed to extend  to impoverish  and inslave   There were now two competitors for the crown  Robert  who was engaged in the Holy war  and Henry  the youngest brother  who remained at home  The right of succession was evidently in favour of the first  but the latter was upon the spot  nothing can be a more evident instance how little hereditary succession was minded at that time  than that Henry s title prevailed  and that he was elected by the joint acclamations of the people  Whenever there is a disputed throne  the people generally regain their liberty  Henry  knowing the weakness of his pretensions to the crown  was resolved to strengthen his power  by gaining the affections of his people  He  therefore  once more confirmed the ancient Saxon laws  and indulged the clergy in all their former privileges   Upon Robert s return from the Holy Land  where he refused to be crowned King of Jerusalem  he found himself deprived  in his absence    72 a kingdom which he considered as his birth right  His attempts  however  to recover it were without success  This Prince seemed only born to be the sport of fortune  his bravery  his generosity  and a thousand other good qualities  of which he was possessed  served to render him the dupe of every deceiver  and the instrument of imposing villainy  At one time  we behold him prosecuting his pretensions with spirit  at another  giving up
