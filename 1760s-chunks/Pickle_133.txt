 You are  surprised   said he   to see me make so much despatch  but I was  extremely hungry  and this is one of the best fricassees I ever tasted   the French are very expert in these dishes  that I must allow  and  upon  my conscience  I would never desire to eat a more delicate rabbit than  this that lies upon my plate    Peregrine made no other reply to this encomium  than the repetition of  the word rabbit  with a note of admiration  and such a significant shake  of the head  as effectually alarmed the other  who instantly suspended  the action of his jaws  and  with the morsel half chewed in his mouth   stared round him with a certain stolidity of apprehension  which  is easier conceived than described  until his eyes encountered the  countenance of Thomas Pipes  who  being instructed  and posted opposite  to him for the occasion  exhibited an arch grin  that completed the  painter s disorder  Afraid of swallowing his mouthful  and ashamed to  dispose of it any other way  he sat some time in a most distressed state  of suspense  and being questioned by Mr  Jolter touching his calamity   made a violent effort of the muscles of his gullet  which with  difficulty performed their office  and then  with great confusion and  concern  asked if Mr  Pickle suspected the rabbit s identity  The young  gentleman  assuming a mysterious air  pretended ignorance of the matter   observing that he was apt to suspect all dishes of that kind  since he  had been informed of the tricks which were commonly played at inns  in France  Italy  and Spain  and recounted three passage in Gil Blas   which we have hinted it above  saying  he did not pretend to be a  connoisseur in animals  but the legs of the creature which composed that  diet which composed the fricassee  did not  in his opinion  resemble  those of the rabbits he had usually seen  This observation had an  evident effect upon the features of the painter  who  with certain signs  of loathing and astonishment  exclaimed   Lord Jesus   and appealed to  Pipes for the discovery of the truth by asking if he knew anything  of the affair  Tom very gravely replied   he did suppose the food  was wholesome enough  for he had seen the skin and feet of a special  ram cat  new flayed  hanging upon the door of a small pantry adjoining  to the kitchen    Before this sentence was uttered  Pallet s belly seemed to move in  contact with his back bone  his colour changed  no part but the whites  of his eyes were to be seen  he dropped his lower jaw  and  fixing his  hands in his sides  retched with such convulsive agonies  as amazed and  disconcerted the whole company  and what augmented his disorder  was  the tenacious retention of the stomach  which absolutely refused to part  with its contents  notwithstanding all the energy of his abhorrence   which threw him into a cold sweat  and almost into a swoon   Pickle  alarmed at his condition  assured him it was a genuine rabbit   and that he had tutored Pipes to say otherwise for the joke s sake   But this confession he considered as a friendly artifice of Pickle s  compassion  and therefore it had little effect upon his constitution  By  the assistance  however  of a large bumper of brandy  his spirits were  recruited  and his recollection so far recovered  that he was able to  declare  with divers contortions of face  that the dish had a rankness  of taste  which he had imparted partly to the nature of the French    6 22 15  3 45 PM   covey  and partly to the composition of their sauces  then he inveighed  against the infamous practices of French publicans  attributing  such imposition to their oppressive government  which kept them so  necessitous  that they were tempted to exercise all manner of knavery  upon their unwary guests   Jolter  who could not find in his heart to let slip any opportunity of  speaking in favour of the French  told him  that he was a very great  stranger to their police  else he would know  that if  upon information  to the magistrate  it should appear that any traveller  native or  foreigner  had been imposed upon or ill treated by a publican  the  offender would be immediately obliged to shut up his house  and  if his  behaviour had been notorious  he himself would be sent to the galleys   without the least hesitation   and as for the dish which has been made  the occasion of your present disorder   said he   I will take upon me  to affirm it was prepared of a genuine rabbit  which was skinned in my  presence  and  in confirmation of what I assert  though such fricassees  are not the favourites of my taste  I will eat a part of this without
