    Thus saying  he led them by a winding descent towards the shore  where  the crew were by this time disembarqued   Sir Randolph approached the stranger   to whom the rest of the company  seemed to pay a particular regard  with a concern truly humane  when   instantly  the eyes of each were fixed in mute surprize upon the  other — My General  — My Knight   Their tongues  could utter no more  they rushed into each other s arms  and clung  together in a tumultuous disorder of grief  amazement  and affection   At length  words forced their passage         Great Earl  cried Randolph  and do I really behold thee  Do I embrace  the man  under whose command my last days of honourable war saw glory  and victory  Hath my leader survived the dreadful night of tempest which  dispersed our ships  He whom we imagined buried in the seas  Is he at  length returned in safety  But why this garb  Are these wretched weeds  befitting the son of an illustrious monarch  the conqueror of  Gascoigne  the glory of England  Thou art come  but not to peace and  repose  danger  difficulty  and distress  are still prepared for that  undaunted spirit  —Am I not in England   replied the stranger   Have I  not at length  happily efcaped the insidious attempts of my enemies   What dangers have I now to fear  No  my dearest 〈◊〉  illustrious dame  tenderest wife  In thy arms  shall I now forget my dangers  To thee I fly  to wipe away those tears   which burst for that my departure  and must have flowed in full streams   during this melancholy interval of my absence  In thee and thy  endearments shall all my future hopes be centered  and never  no  never  more shall WILLIAM be deluded by the smiling promises of glory  to  hazard the chance of arms  Enough hath been already done  enough hath  been given to honour and to my country  Peace and retirement  repose and  tranquillity be now the lot of these shattered limbs  and this  distracted  wearied spirit         Whilst the Earl thus indulged his flattering prospects of tranquillity   the thoughts of Randolph were busy and disordered  he surveyed him with  a mixture of pity and affection  and half suppressing the sigh that  laboured in his breast  he assumed a look of ease and complacency  and  invited Lord William and his attendants to partake of the refreshment  which his neighbouring residence afforded  They passed on with the  pleasing sensations of men  who after a length of days spent  in a foreign and unfriendly land  began once more to taste the comforts  of a native country  and to share in the social intercourse of kinsmen  and fellow citizens  Their leader turned to the youthful pilgrim  whom  he embraced with a tender and affectionate concern  but with such joy as  seemed clouded by the remembrance of past calamities  They retired a few  paces as if in private conference  and the elder seemed intent in  comforting and encouraging  The courteous Knight would not break in upon  their private conference  and to leave them the more free to indulge  that mutual affection which they discovered  he turned to his youths    Behold   said he         this truly honourable Lord  great in descent  powerful in arms  full of  the mighty spirit of his royal father the second Henry  a monarch  fatally seduced by the beauty of Rosamond  and  mark the just  dispensations of heaven  heavy was the punishment which the mother paid   for her forbidden love  nor hath misfortune spared this the offspring  of an unlawful and unhappy passion  Yet let us be just to his virtues   and learn from him  that renown is not to be purchased but by toil and  perils  Under his banners hath your father oftentimes encountered  dangers  With him did I hasten to support the cause and title of our  King  when John had met his fate  and the son of France rioted in the  calamities of England  With him did these old arms contribute to execute  the vengeance of our country upon the adherents of the perfidious Lewis   and when the Count Mal leon revolted from his liege lord  and erected  the standard of France in our province of Gascoigne  then did he  bravely second the efforts of Richard  uncle to our Prince  and led us  on to victory  Aspire to the same renown  but expect the like fortune   dream not of undisturbed happiness and tranquillity  By expecting  labour and distress  you shall learn to encounter  and to conquer them   in a glorious and honest cause         Thus far paternal tenderness diverted the attention of Randolph from his  illustrious friend  who in this short interval had been equally engaged   He embraced his  followers  congratulated their happy arrival  and zealously extolled
