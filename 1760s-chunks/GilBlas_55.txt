Adventure of the recovered ring   I WAS no sooner at home than Doctor Sangrado came in  I talked to him about the patients I had seen  and paid into his hands eight remaining rials of the twelve I had received for my prescriptions  Eight rials  said he  as he counted them  mighty little for two visits  But we must take things as we find them  In the spirit of taking things as he found them  he laid violent hands on six  giving me the other two    Here  Gil Blas  continued he  see what a foundation to build upon  I make over to you the fourth of all you may bring me  You will soon feather your nest  my friend  for  by the blessing of Providence  there will be a great deal of ill health this year   I had reason to be content with my dividend  since  having determined to keep back the third part of what I received in my rounds  and afterwards touching another fourth of the remainder  half of the whole  if arithmetic is anything more than a deception  would become my perquisite  This inspired me with new zeal for my profession  The next day  as soon as I had dined  I resumed my medical paraphernalia  and took the field once more  I visited several patients on the list  and treated their several complaints in one invariable routine  Hitherto things went on under the rose  and no individual  thank heaven  had risen up in rebellion against my prescriptions  But let a physician s cures be as  extraordinary as they will  some quack or other is always ready to rip up his reputation  I was called in to a grocer s son in a dropsy  Whom should I find there before me but a little black  looking physician  by name Doctor Cuchillo  introduced by a relation of the family  I bowed round most profoundly  but dipped lowest to the personage whom I took to have been invited to a consultation with me  He returned my compliment with a distant air  then  having stared me in the face for a few seconds    Signor Doctor  said he  I beg pardon for being inquisitive  I thought I had been acquainted with all my brethren in Valladolid  but I confess your physiognomy is altogether new  You must have been settled but a short time in town  I avowed myself a young practitioner  acting as yet under the direction of Doctor Sangrado  I wish you joy  replied he politely  you are studying under a great man  You must doubtless have seen a vast deal of sound practice  young as you appear to be  He spoke this with so easy an assurance  that I was at a loss whether he meant it seriously  or was laughing at me  While I was conning over my reply  the grocer  seizing on the opportunity  said    Gentlemen  I am persuaded of your both being perfectly competent in your art  have the goodness without ado to take the case in hand  and devise some effectual means for the restoration of my son s health   Thereupon the little pulse counter set himself about reviewing the patient s situation  and after having dilated to me on all the symptoms  asked me what I thought the fittest method of treatment  I am of opinion  replied I  that he should be bled once a day  and drink as much warm water as he can swallow  At these words  our diminutive doctor said to me with a malicious simper    And so you think such a course will save the patient  Never doubt it  exclaimed I in a confident tone  it must produce that effect  because it is a certain method of cure for all distempers  Ask Signor Sangrado  At that rate  retorted he  Celsus is altogether in the wrong  for he contends that the readiest way to cure a dropsical subject is to let him almost die of hunger and thirst  Oh  as for Celsus  interrupted I  he is no oracle of mine  as fallible as the meanest of us  I often have occasion to bless myself for going contrary to his dogmas  I discover by your language  said Cuchillo  the safe and sure method of practice Doctor Sangrado instils into his pupils  Bleeding and drenching are the extent of his resources  No wonder so many worthy people are cut off under his direction         No defamation  interrupted I with some acrimony  a member of the faculty had better not begin throwing stones  Come  come  my learned doctor  patients can get to the other world without bleeding and warm water  and I question whether the most deadly of us has ever signed more passports than yourself  If you have any crow to pluck with Signor Sangrado  write against him  he will answer you  and we shall soon see who will have the best of the battle  By all the saints in the calendar  swore he  in a transport of passion  you little know whom you are talking to  I have a tongue and a fist  my friend  and am not afraid of Sangrado  who  with all his arrogance and affectation
