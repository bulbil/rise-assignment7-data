floor —The noise which our combat occasioned  by this time bringing up the people of the house  I thought it highly necessary to think of making my escape  especially as they all cried out  he s a dead man  and he himself advised me to set immediately off —I did so—and  leaving Edwards to follow with my baggage  I quitted Paris in less than an hour  and shall embark in a few minutes for Dover   Such is the history of this quarrel—and now  Charles hear me attentively —The moment you receive this  go to lady Haversham  and tell her  that if   201 Louisa and her friends are not entirely reconciled  and ready to receive me at my going over  I shall take an everlasting leave of England  and perhaps  banish myself for life  from any degree of converse with human society —Tell her that what my angel has suffered  and suffered chiefly through my means  has rendered her so inconceivably dear to my fond heart  that a new disappointment will probably drive me to some instant act of desperation —In short  Charles  tell lady Haversham every thing which is most likely to alarm her tenderness  or work upon her generosity —But why do I affront the excellent woman with a doubt of this unnecessary nature —Why do I suppose—But  Charles  I will neither talk of doubts nor supposes—The first are the greatest injury to the benignity of her heart  and the latter  I hope  is a violence to the justice of my   202 own  Adieu  therefore  my dear Melmoth  and be assured  that  let my fate be whatsoever it may  I must be  as long as I live   Your true friend  R  HAROLD     203  LETTER XXI  Lady HAVERSHAM to the Countess of BLANDFORD    My dear Lady BLANDFORD   MY cares are now over—Bob is at last married to Miss Mildmay—and has turned out the very thing I always thought he would—a man of real probity  and sound understanding —Your ladyship already knows what a variety of misfortunes attended my sweet sister  from the time of her expulsion from her father s  till her departure from the Magdalen —So that all which is necessary for me to relate  is the reception which her family gave her  and the reception which she gave my brother   I have already told you  that the moment her poor parents saw her letter to   204 Miss Beauclerk  they wrote up to me  desiring me to take her instantly away from the strange asylum which she had chosen in her delirium  and promising to be in town within a week  when every thing should be settled to my satisfaction  for I had frequently told them  how passionately Bob continued to love the unfortunate young lady  under all the disadvantages of what we considered a scandalous elopement —They at the same time sent me up Louisa s little history  where I saw plainly enough  that notwithstanding the unaccountable part which my brother had acted  the dear deceived girl could not  by any means  erase him from her heart —A copy of this letter I therefore got that worthy man  Mr  Melmoth  to take  for Bob s immediate use  and flew myself to the Magdalen  to which  as I have been  upon some occasions  a benefactress  I have always access  and enquired for   205 Louisa by her assumed appellation of Windham —The good Mrs  Dobson  and her sister  who have acquired so just a consideration with Louisa  were with her when I went in—the two honest women  it seems  are intimately acquainted with the matron  and that acquaintance admitted them  whenever they pleased  to Miss Windham —They were now sitting in the matron s room  when my appearance threw the little group into the greatest consternation —Louisa  the moment she saw me  started from her seat with a light ning like rapidity  and exclaiming    Lady Haversham  lady Haversham   fainted instantly in my arms —Her two friends seemed prodigiously struck—but nevertheless exerted themselves so successfully in recovering her  that she was quickly in a capacity of conversing  which  when they found  they proposed to withdraw  though Mrs  Dobson had a visible reluctance   206 in her manner  that made me consider her with extraordinary attention —Miss Mildmay  however  would not suffer them to stir  but  taking each by the hand  presented them with such a grace to me  that I could not help kissing her heartily for the condescending dignity of the recollection —  My dear lady Haversham   says she   you have  I suppose  seen my letter to Miss Beauclerk   —I answered in the affirmative — Why then   continued she   give me leave to present two of the worthiest creatures in the universe to your ladyship —This  Madam  is the excellent Mrs  Dobson—and this the beneficent Mrs  Carter  whom I have mentioned in that paper     I rose  and saluted each of them  thanking them in the warmest terms  for their generous attention to Miss Mildmay  and  begging to know in what   207 manner I could be serviceable to them on her account — O  Madam   cried Mrs  Dobson  falling
