the arms of a lover  with some little fellow feeling for the frailties of her age   One morning I was carrying  according to custom  a note to this peerless pattern of perfection  There certainly were  or I was not standing in the room  the feet of a man ensconced behind the tapestry  Out slunk I  just as if I had no eyes in my head  yet  though such a discovery was nothing but what might have been expected  neither was the piper to be paid out of my pocket  my feelings were a good deal staggered at the breach of faith  Ah  traitress  exclaimed I with virtuous indignation  abandoned Euphrasia  Not satisfied to humbug a silly old gentleman with a tale of love  you share his property in your person with another  and add profligacy to dissimulation  But to be sure  on after  thoughts  I was but a greenhorn  when I took on so for such a trivial occurrence  It was rather a subject for mirth than for moral reflection  and perfectly justified by the way of the world  the languid  embargoed commerce of my master s amorous moments had need be flipped by a trade in some more merchantable wares  At all events it would have been better to have held my tongue  than to have laid hold on such an opportunity of playing the faithful servant  But instead of tempering my zeal with discretion  nothing would serve the turn but taking up the wrongs of Don Gonzales in the spirit of chivalry  On this high principle  I made a circumstantial report of what I had seen  with the addition of the attempt made by Euphrasia to seduce me from my good faith  I gave it in her own words without the least reserve  and put him in the way of knowing all that was to be known of his mistress  He was struck all in a heap by my intelligence  and a faint flash of indignation on his faded cheek seemed to give security  that the lady s infidelity would not go unpunished  Enough  Gil Blas  said he  I am infinitely obliged by your attachment to my service  and your probity is very acceptable to me  I will go to Euphrasia this very moment  I will overwhelm her with reproaches  and break at once with the ungrateful creature  With these words  he actually bent his way to the subject of his anger  and dispensed with my attendance  from the kind motive of sparing me the awkwardness which my presence during their explanation would have occasioned to my feelings   I longed for my master s return with all the impatience of an interested person  There could not be a doubt but that with his strong grounds of complaint  he would return completely disentangled from the snares of his nymph  In this thought I extolled and magnified myself for my good deed  What could be more flattering than the thanks of the kindred who were naturally to inherit after Don Gonzales  when they should be informed that their relative was no longer the puppet of a figure dance so hostile to their interests  It was not to be supposed but that such a friend would be remembered  and that my merits would at last be distinguished from those of other serving men  who are usually more disposed to encourage their masters in licentiousness  than to draw them off to habits of decency  I was always of an aspiring temper  and thought to have passed for the Joseph or the Scipio of the servants  hall  but so fascinating an idea was only to be indulged for an hour or two  The founder of my fortunes came home  My friend  said he  I have had a very sharp brush with Euphrasia  She insists on it that you have trumped up a cock and bull story  If their word is to be taken  you are no better than an impostor  a hireling in the pay of my nephews  for whose sake you have set all your wits at work to bring about a quarrel between her and me  I have seen the real tears  made of water  run down in floods from her poor dear eyes  She has vowed to me as solemnly as if I had been her confessor  that she never made any overtures to you in her life  and that she does not know what man is  Beatrice  who seems a simple  innocent sort of girl  is exactly in the same story  so that I could not but believe them and be pacified  whether I would or no   How then  sir  interrupted I  in accents of undissembled sorrow  do you question my sincerity  Do you distrust         No  my good lad  interrupted he again in his turn  I will do you ample justice  I do not suspect you of being in league with my nephews  I am satisfied that all you have done has been for my good  and own myself much obliged to you for it  but appearances are apt to mislead  so that perhaps you did not see in reality what you took it into your head that you saw  and in that case  only consider yourself how offensive your charge must be to Euphrasia  Yet let that be as it will
