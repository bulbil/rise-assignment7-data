cordially concerned for your concern  But  my dear Grandison  it is only God that she prefers to you  She suffers more than you can do  She has no other way  she assures me  to comfort herself  but by indulging her hopes  that she shall not live long—Dear creature  She flatters herself  that her reason is restored  in answer to her fervent supplications  which  she says  she put up to Heaven  in all her lucid intervals  that for the sake of her parents and brothers  it might be restored  and that then she might be taken to the arms of mercy  But if your heart be deeply affected  my Grandison—  It is  Jeronymo  I am not an insensible man  But should now our dear Clementina be prevailed upon to descend from the height to which she has soared  however my wishes might be gratified by the condescension  yet  while she believed her conscience would be wounded by it  I could not but think it would be some Page  235 diminution to her glory  And how  as she has hinted in one of her letters to me  would it be possible  were I to see my beloved wife unhappy with her scruples  to forbear endeavouring to quiet her mind by removing them  And could this be effected  without giving her an opinion of the religion I profess  in opposition to hers  And would not that subject me to a breach of articles  O my dear Jeronymo  Matters must stand just as they do  except she could think more favourably of my religion  and less favourably of her own   He began to talk of their obligations to me  I declared  that they could no other way give me pain  Do not  said I  let this subject ever be again mentioned  by you  or any of the family  Every one  my dear Jeronymo  is not called upon by the occasion  as I have had the happiness to be  Would my friend envy me this happiness   I wish  Dr  Bartlett  with all my heart  that I could think of any thing that I could accept of  to make such grateful spirits easy  It pains me  to be placed by them in such a superior light  as must give them pain  What  my dear Dr  Bartlett  can I do  consistent with my notions of friendship  to make their hearts easy   He was afraid  he said  that I should now soon think of leaving them   I told him  that having no doubt of Lady Clementina s perseverance in her resolution  and of her leave to return to my native country  I should be glad  for my own sake  as well as the Lady s  to be allowed to depart in a few days  Mr  Lowther  as it would make Jeronymo  as he had declared  more easy  would stay behind me  But dismiss him  my friend  said I  as soon as you can  He had obtained abroad a happy competency  and was returned to England  when I first knew him  with intent to enjoy it  He is as rich as he wants to be  and can gratisy only the natural benevolence of his heart  by attending my dear friend  Page  236 I hope to get him to accept of apartments with me  in my London house  and to fix his retirement  if not with me in my paternal seat  in its neighbourhood at least  He has merit that is not confined to his profession  But for what he has done for my Jeronymo  he will always hold a prime place in my heart   It is true  Dr  Bartlett  and I please myself  that he will be found as worthy of your friendly love  and my Beauchamp s  as of mine  If I can at last be indulged in my long  long hoped for wish  of settling in my native country  with some tolerable tranquillity of mind  I shall endeavour to draw around me such a ollection of worthies  as shall make my neighbourhood one of the happiest spots in Britain   The Marchioness came up to us  Clementina  said she  is apprehensive that you soon will leave us  Her father and brothers are walking with her in the garden  They will  I dare say  be glad of your company   I left Jeronymo and his mother together  and joined the Marquis  the General  the Bishop  and Clementina  The General s Lady and Father Marescotti were in another ally  in earnest conversation   The Marquis made me a high compliment  and after a few turns  the Prelate led off his father and brother  and left Clementina and me alone together   Were you not cruel  Chevalier  said she  in your last Lettet to me  not only to deny me your weight in the request my heart was  and is still  set upon  but to strengthen their arguments against me  Great use have some of my friends made of what you wrote  O Sir  you have won the heart of Giacomo  but you have contributed to oppress that of his sister  Indeed  indeed
