no wonder they should say that one must see the court of Madrid to form an adequate idea of its magnificence  I am delighted to have directed my course hither  and feel a sort of prescience within me that I shall not come away without taking fortune by surprise  I caught nothing napping  however  but my own prudence  in making some thriftless  expensive acquaintance  My money oozed away in the rapid thaw of my propriety and better judgment  so that it became a measure of expedient degradation to throw away my transcendent merit on a pedagogue of Salamanca  whom some family lawsuit or other concern had brought to Madrid  where he was born  and where chance  more whimsical than wise  thrust me within the horizon of his knowledge  I became his right hand  his prime principal agent  and dogged him at the heels to the university when he returned thither   My new employer went by the name of Don Ignacio de Ipigna  He furnished himself with the handle of don  inasmuch as he had been tutor to a nobleman of the first rank  who had recompensed his early services with an annuity for life  he likewise derived a snug little salary from his professorship in the university  and in addition to all this  laid the public under a yearly contribution of two or three hundred pistoles for books of uninstructive morality  which he protruded from the press periodically by weight and measure  The manner in which he worked up the shreds and patches of his composition de serves a notice somewhat more than cursory  The heavy hours of the forenoon were spent in muzzing over Hebrew  Greek  and Latin authors  and in writing down upon little squares of card every pithy sentence or striking thought which occurred in the morning s reading  According to the progress of this literary Pam  in winning tricks from the ancients  he employed me to score up his honours in the form of an Apollo s wreath  these metaphysical garlands were strung upon wire  and each garland made a pocket volume  What an execrable hash of wholesome viands did we cook up  The commandments set at loggerheads with an utter confusion of tables  Epicurean conclusions grafted on stoical premises  Tully quoting Epictetus  and Seneca supporting his antitheses on the authority of monkish rhyme  Scarcely a month elapsed without our putting forth at least two volumes  so that the press was kept continually groaning under the weight of our transgressions  What seemed most extraordinary of all  was that these literary larcenies were palmed upon the purchasers for spick and span new wares  and if  by any strange and improbable chance  a thick  headed critic should stumble with his noddle smack against some palpable plagiarism  the author would plead guilty to the indictment  and make a merit of serving up at second hand  What Gellius or Stobaeus hash d before  Though chewed by blind old scholiasts o er and o er   He was also a great commentator  and filled his notes chuck full of so much erudition  as to multiply whole pages of discussion upon what homely common sense would have consigned to the brief alternative of a query   Disputes of Me or Te  or Aut at At  To sound or sink in cano O or A  Or give up Cicero to C or K   As almost every author  ethical and didactic  from Hesiod down to himself  took his turn to dangle on some one or other of our manuscript garlands  it was impossible for me not to suck in somewhat of sage nurture from so copious a stream of philosophy  it would be rank ingratitude to shift off my obligation  My hand  writing also became strictly and decidedly legible  by dint of continual transcription  my estate was more that of a pupil than of a servant  and my morals were not neglected  while my mind was polished  and my faculties raised above their former level  Scipio  he used to say  when he chanced to hear of any serving lad with more cunning than honesty in his dealings  beware  my good boy  how you take after the evil example of that graceless villain   The honour of a servant is his fidelity  his highest virtues are submission and obedience  Be studious of thy master s interests  be diligent in his affairs  and faithful to the trust which he reposeth in thee  Thy time and thy labour belong unto him  Defraud him not thereof  for he payeth thee for them   To sum up all  Don Ignacio lost no opportunity of leading me on in the path of virtue  and his prudent counsels sank so deep into my heart  as to keep under anything like even the slightest wish of playing him a rogue s trick during the fifteen months which I spent in his service   I have already mentioned that Doctor de Ipigna was a native of Madrid  He had a relation there  by name Catalina  waiting maid to the lady who officiated as nurse to the heir apparent  This abigail  the same through whose intervention I got Signor de Santillane released from the tower of Segovia  intent on rendering a service to Don Ignacio  prevailed with her mistress to petition the Duke of Lerma for some preferment  The minister named him for the archdeaconry of Grenada  which  as a conquered
