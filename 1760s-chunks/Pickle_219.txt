everything appeared joyous to a young creature  who was so void  of experience and dissimulation  that she believed everybody s heart as  sincere as her own  and every object such as it appeared to be    Among the swains who sighed  or pretended to sigh for me  were two  that bore a pretty equal share of my favour  it was too superficial to  deserve the name of love   One of these was a forward youth of sixteen   extremely handsome  lively  and impudent  He attended in quality of page  upon the Princess Amelia  who spent that season at Bath  The other was a    6 22 15  3 45 PM   Scotch nobleman turned of thirty  who was graced with a red ribbon  and  danced particularly well  two qualifications of great weight with a  girl of my age  whose heart was not deeply interested in the cause   Nevertheless  the page prevailed over this formidable rival  though our  amour went no farther than a little flirting  and ceased entirely when I  left the place    Next year  however  I revisited this agreeable scene  and passed my  time in the same circle of amusements  in which  indeed  each season  at Bath is exactly resembled by that which succeeds  allowing for the  difference of company  which is continually varying  There I met with  the same incense  and again had my favourite  who was a North Briton   and captain of foot  near forty years of age  and a little lame  an  impediment which I did not discover  until it was pointed out by some  of my companions  who rallied me upon my choice  He was always  cheerful  and very amorous  had a good countenance  and an excellent  understanding  possessed a great deal of art  and would have persuaded  me to marry him  had I not been restrained by the authority of my  father  whose consent was not to be obtained in favour of a man of his  fortune    At the same time  many proposals of marriage were made to my parents   but as they came from people whom I did not like  I rejected them all   being determined to refuse every man who did not make his addresses to  myself in person  because I had no notion of marrying for anything  but love  Among these formal proposers was a Scottish earl  whose  pretensions were broke off by some difference about settlements  and  the son of an English baron  with whom my father was in treaty  when  he carried me to town  on a visit to a young lady with whom I had been  intimate from my infancy  She was just delivered of her first son  for  whom we stood sponsors  so that this occasion detained us a whole month   during which I went to a ball at court  on the Queen s birthday  and  there  for the first time  felt what love and beauty were    The second son of Duke H    who had just returned from his travels  was  dancing with the princess royal  when a young lady came and desired  me to go and see a stranger  whom all the world admired  Upon which I  followed her into the circle  and observed this object of admiration  He  was dressed in a coat of white cloth  faced with blue satin  embroidered  with silver  of the same piece with his waistcoat  his fine hair hung  down his back in ringlets below his waist  his hat was laced with  silver  and garnished with a white feather  but his person beggared  description  He was tall and graceful  neither corpulent nor meagre  his  limbs finely proportioned  his countenance open and majestic  his eyes  full of sweetness and vivacity  his teeth regular  and his pouting lips  of the complexion of the damask rose  In short  he was formed for  love  and inspired it wherever he appeared  nor was he a niggard of his  talents  but liberally returned it  at least  what passed for such  for  he had a flow of gallantry  for which many ladies of this land can vouch  from their own experience  But he exclaimed against marriage  because  he had  as yet  met with no woman to whose charms he would surrender his  liberty  though a princess of France  and lady of the same rank in      were said to be  at that time  enamoured of his person    I went home  totally engrossed by his idea  flattering myself that he  had observed me with some attention  for I was young and new  and had  the good fortune to attract the notice and approbation of the queen    6 22 15  3 45 PM   herself     Next day  being at the opera  I was agreeably surprised with the  appearance of this amiable stranger  who no sooner saw me enter  than  he approached so near to the place where I sat
