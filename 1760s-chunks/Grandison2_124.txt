at the Cocoa tree in Pall mall  Lieut  Col  Mackenzie  and Major Dillon  two of his frienda  with whom I had no acquaintance  were with him  Ths Captain and I withdrew to a private room  The two gentlemen enter d it with us   You will on this occasion  I know  expect me to be particular  Yet must allow  that I had no good cause to manage  since those points that had most weight  and which were the ground of your objections to him  when you saw him in a near light  could not be pleaded without affronting him  and if they were  would hardly meet with his allowance  and could therefore have no force in the argument     310 On the two gentlemen entering the room with us  without apology or objection  I ask d the Captain  If they were acquainted with the affair we met upon  He said  They were his dear and inseparable friends  and knew every secret of his heart  Perhaps in this case  Captain Anderson  returned I  it were as well they did not   We are men of honour  Sir Charles Grandison  said the Major briskly   I don t doubt it  Sir  But where the delicacy of a Lady is concern d  the hearts of the principals should be the whole world to each other  But what is done  is done  I am ready to enter upon the affair before these gentlemen  if you choose it  Captain   You will find us to be gentlemen  Sir Charles  said the Colonel   The Captain then began  with warmth  his own story  Indeed he told it very well  I was pleased  for my sister s sake  pardon me  Charlotte  that he did  He is not contemptible  either in person or understanding  He may be said  perhaps  to be an illiterate  but he is not an ignorant man  tho  not the person whom the friends of Charlotte Grandison would think worthy of the first place in her heart   After he had told his story  which I need not repeat to you  he insisted upon your promise  And his two friends declared in his favour  with airs  each man  a little too peremptory  I told them so  and that they must do me the justice to consider me as a man of some spirit  as well as themselves  I came hither with a friendly intention  gentlemen said I  I do not love to follow the lead of hasty spirits  But if you expect to carry any point with me  it must not be either by raised voices  or heightened complexions   Their features were all at once changed  And they said  they meant not to be warm   I told the Captain  That I would not enter into a minute defence of the Lady  tho  my sister  I owned    311 that there had appeared a precipitation in her conduct  Her treatment at home  as she aprehended  was not answerable to her merits  She was young  and knew nothing of the world  Young Ladies were often struck by appearances  You  Captain Anderson  said I  have advantages in person and manner  that might obtain for you a young Lady s attention  And as she believed herself circumstanced in her family  I wonder not that she lent an air to the address of a gallant man  whose command in that neighbourhood  and  I doubt not  whose behaviour in that command  added to his consequence  But I take it for granted  Sir  that you met with difficulties from her  when she came to reflect upon the disreputation of a young woman s carrying on clandestinely a correspondence with a man  of whose address her father  then living  was not likely to approve  There was none of that violent passion on either side  that precludes reason  discretion  duty  It is no wonder then  that a woman of Charlotte Grandison s known good sense  should reflect  should consider  And perhaps the less  that you should therefore seek to engage her by promise  But what was the promise  It was not the promise that  it seems  you sought to engage her to make  To be absolutely yours  and no other man s  But it was  That she would not marry any other man without your consent  while you remained single  An unreasonable promise  however  I will presume to say  either to be proposed  or submitted to   Sir  said the Captain  and looked the Soldier   I repeated what I last said   Sir  again said the Captain  and looked upon his friends  who pointed each his head at the other  and at him  by turns—as if they had said  Very free language   For  Sir  proceeded I  did it not give room to think  that you had either some doubts of your own merit with the Lady  or of her affection and steadiness   312 And in either case  ought it to have been proposed  ought it to have been made  For my part  I should disdain to think of any
