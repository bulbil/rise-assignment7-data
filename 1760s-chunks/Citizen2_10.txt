Our party consisted of my friend in superlative finery  his stockings rolled  a black velvet waistcoat which was formerly new  and his grey wig combed down in imitation of hair  A pawn broker s widow  of whom  by the bye  my friend was a professed admirer  dressed out in green damask  with three gold rings on every finger  Mr  Tibbs the second rate beau  I have formerly described  together with his lady  •n flimsy silk  dirty gauze instead of linnen  and an hat as big as an umbrello     26Our first difficulty was in settling how we should set out  Mrs  Tibbs had a natural aversion to the water  and the widow being a little in flesh  as warmly protested against walking  a coach was therefore agreed upon  which being too small to carry five  Mr  Tibbs consented to sit in his wife s lap   In this manner therefore we set forward  being entertained by the way with the bodings of Mr  Tibbs  who assured us  he did not expect to see a single creature for the evening above the degree of a cheesemonger  that this was the last night of the gardens  and that consequently we should be pestered with the nobility and gentry from Thames street and Crooked lane  with several other prophetic ejaculations probably inspired by the uneasiness of his situation   The illuminations began before we arrived  and I must confess  that upon entring the gardens  I found every sense overpaid with more than expected pleasure  the lights every where glimmering through the scarcely moving trees  the full bodied consort bursting on the stillness of the night  the natural consort of the birds  in the more retired part of the grove  vying with that which was formed by art  the company gayly dressed looking satisfaction  and the tables spread with various delacacies  all conspired to sill my imagination with the visionary happiness of the Arabian lawgiver  and lifted me into an extasy of admiration  Head of Confucius  cried I to my friend  this is fine  this unites rural beauty with courtly magnificence  if we except the virgins of immortality that hang on every tree  and may be   27 plucked at every desire  I don t see how this falls short of Mahomet s Paradise  As for virgins  cries my friend  it is true  they are a fruit that don t much abound in our gardens here  but if ladies as plenty as apples in autumn  and as complying as any hoüry of them all can content you  I fancy  we have no need to go to heaven for Paradise   I was going to second his remarks  when we were called to a consultation by Mr  Tibbs and the rest of the company  to know in what manner we were to lay out the evening to the greatest advantage  Mrs  Tibbs was for keeping the genteel walk of the garden  where she observed there was always the very best company  the widow  on the contrary  who came but once a season  was for securing a good standing place to see the water works  which she assured us would begin in less than an hour at farthest  a dispute therefore began  and as it was managed between two of very opposite characters  it threatned to grow more bitter at every reply  Mrs  Tibbs wondered how people could pretend to know the polite world who had received all their rudiments of breeding behind a compter  to which the other replied  that tho  some people sat behind compters  yet they could sit at the head of their own tables too  and carve three good dishes of hot meat whenever they thought proper  which was more than some people could say for themselves  that hardly knew a rabbet and onions from a green goose and gooseberries   It is hard to say where this might have ended  had not the husband  who probably knew the   28 impetuosity of his wife s disposition  proposed to end the dispute by adjourning to a box  and try if there was any thing to be had for supper that was supportable  To this we all consented  but here a new distress arose  Mr  and Mrs  Tibbs would sit in none but a genteel box  a box where they might see and be seen  one  as they expressed it  in the very focus of public view  but such a box was not easy to be obtained  for tho  we were perfectly convinced of our own gentility  and the gentility of our appearance  yet we found it a difficult matter to persuade the keepers of the boxes to be of our opinion  they chose to reserve genteel boxes for what they judged more genteel company   At last however we were fixed  tho  somewhat obscurely  and supplied with the usual entertainment of the place  The widow found the supper excellent  but Mrs  Tibbs thought every thing detestable  come  come  my dear  cries the husband  by way of consolation  to be sure we can t find such dressing here as we have at lord Crump s or lady Crimp s  but for Vauxhall dressing it is pretty good  it is not their victuals indeed I find fault with  but their wine
