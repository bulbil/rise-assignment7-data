words for your poor Pamela  and I began to   think whether I was not indeed a very naughty body  and had not done   vile things  But when I thought of his having discovered poor John  and   of Sir Simon s base officiousness  in telling him of Mr  Williams  with   what he had resolved against him in revenge for his goodness to me  I   was quite dispirited  and yet still more about that fearful Colbrand    and what he could see done to me  for then I was ready to gasp for   breath  and my heart quite failed me  Then how dreadful are the words    that he will decide my fate in three weeks  Gracious Heaven  said I    strike me dead  before that time  with a thunderbolt  or provide some   way for my escaping these threatened mischiefs  God forgive me  if I   sinned       At last  I took up the letter directed for Mrs  Jewkes  but designed   for me  and I find that little better than the other  These are the hard   terms it contains           Well have you done  perverse  forward  artful  yet foolish Pamela    to convince me  before it was too late  how ill I had done to place my   affections on so unworthy an object  I had vowed honour and love to your   unworthiness  believing you a mirror of bashful modesty and unspotted   innocence  and that no perfidious designs lurked in so fair a bosom  But   now I have found you out  you specious hypocrite  and I see  that though   you could not repose the least confidence in one you had known for   years  and who  under my good mother s misplaced favour for you  had   grown up in a manner with you  when my passion  in spite of my pride    and the difference of our condition  made me stoop to a meanness that   now I despise myself for  yet you could enter into an intrigue with a   man you never knew till within these few days past  and resolve to run   away with a stranger  whom your fair face  and insinuating arts  had   bewitched to break through all the ties of honour and gratitude to me    even at a time when the happiness of his future life depended upon my   favour        Henceforth  for Pamela s sake  whenever I see a lovely face  will   I mistrust a deceitful heart  and whenever I hear of the greatest   pretences to innocence  will I suspect some deep laid mischief  You were   determined to place no confidence in me  though I have solemnly  over   and over  engaged my honour to you  What  though I had alarmed your   fears in sending you one way  when you hoped to go another  yet  had   I not  to convince you of my resolution to do justly by you   although   with great reluctance  such then was my love for you   engaged not   to come near you without your own consent  Was not this a voluntary   demonstration of the generosity of my intention to you  Yet how have   you requited me  The very first fellow that your charming face  and   insinuating address  could influence  you have practised upon  corrupted   too  I may say   and even ruined  as the ungrateful wretch shall find     and thrown your forward self upon him  As  therefore  you would place no   confidence in me  my honour owes you nothing  and  in a little time  you   shall find how much you have erred  in treating  as you have done  a man   who was once                                            Your affectionate and kind friend         Mrs  Jewkes has directions concerning you  and if your lot is now   harder than you might wish  you will bear it the easier  because your   own rash folly has brought it upon you           Alas  for me  what a fate is mine  to be thus thought artful  and   forward  and ungrateful  when all I intended was to preserve my   innocence  and when all the poor little shifts  which his superior   wicked wit and cunning have rendered ineffectual  were forced upon me in   my own necessary defence       When Mrs  Jewkes came up to me again  she found me bathed in tears  She   seemed  as I thought  to be moved to some compassion  and
