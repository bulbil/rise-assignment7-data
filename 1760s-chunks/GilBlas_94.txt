with your actresses  that I scarcely dare avow my dissent  That is very prudent  interrupted Don Alexo with a sneer  your criticisms would be ill received  You should be tender of our actresses before the trumpeters of their fame  We carouse with them every day  we warrant them sound in their conceptions  we would give vouchers for the justness of their expression if it were necessary  No doubt of it  answered his kinsman  you would do the same kind office by their lives and their manners  from the same motives of companionable feeling   Your ladies of the sock and buskin at Lisbon  said the Marquis de Zenette  laughing  are doubtless far superior  They certainly are  replied Don Pompeyo  They are some of them at least perfect in their cast  And these  resumed the Marquis  would be warranted by you in their conceptions and expressions  I have no personal acquaintance with them  rejoined Don Pompeyo  I am not of their revels  and can judge of their merit without partiality  Do you  in good earnest  think your company first rate  No  really  said the Marquis  I think no such thing  and only plead the cause of a few individuals  I give up all the rest  Will you not allow extraordinary powers to the actress who played Dido  Did she not personate that queen with the dignity  and at the same time with all the bewitching charms  calculated to realize our idea of the character  Could you help admiring the skill with which she seizes on the passions of the spectator  and harmonizes their tone to the vibrations she purposes to produce  She may be called perfect in the exquisite art of declaiming  I agree with you  said Don Pompeyo  that she can touch the string either of terror or of pity  never did any actress come closer to the heart  and the performance is altogether fine  but still she is not without her defects  Two or three things disgusted me in her playing  Would she denote surprise  she glances her eyes to and fro in a most extravagant manner  altogether unbecoming her supposed majesty as a princess  Add to this  that in swelling her voice  which is of itself sound and mellifluous  she goes out of her natural key  and assumes a harsh ranting tone  Besides  it would seem as if she might be suspected in more than one passage  of not very clearly comprehending her author  Yet I would in candour rather suppose her wanting in diligence than capacity   As far as I see  said Don Matthias to the critic  you will never write complimentary odes to our actresses  Pardon me  answered Don Pompeyo  I can discover high talent through all their imperfections  I must say that I was enchanted with the chambermaid in the interlude  What fine natural parts  With what grace she treads the stage  Has she anything pointed to deliver  she heightens it by an arch smile  with a keen glance and sarcastic emphasis  which convey more to the understanding than the words to the ear  It might be objected that she sometimes gives too much scope to her animal spirits  and exceeds the limits of allowable freedom  but that would be hypercritical  There is one bad habit I should strongly advise her to correct  Sometimes in the very crisis of the action  and in an affecting passage  she bursts in all at once upon the interest with some misplaced jest  to curry favour with the mob of barren spectators  The pit  you will say  is caught by her artifice  that may be well for her popularity  but not for their taste   And what do you think of the men  interrupted the Marquis  you must give them no quarter  since you have handled the women so roughly  Not so  said Don Pompeyo  There are some promising young actors  and I am particularly well pleased with that corpulent performer who played the part of Dido s prime minister  His recitation is unaffected  and he declaims just as they do in Portugal  If you can bear such a fellow as that  said Segiar  you must be charmed with the representative of Eneas  Did not you think him a great  an original performer  Very original  indeed  answered the critic  his inflections are quite his own  they are as shrill as an hautboy  Almost always out of nature  he rattles the impressive words of the sentence off his tongue  while he labours and lingers on the expletives  the poor conjunctions are frightened at their own report as they go off  He entertained me excessively  and especially when he was expressing in confidence his distress at abandoning the princess  never was grief more ludicrously depicted  Fair and softly  cousin  replied Don Alexo  you will make us believe at last that good taste is not greatly cultivated at the court of Portugal  Do you know that the actor of whom we are speaking is esteemed a phenomenon  Did you not observe what thunders of applause he called down  He cannot therefore be contemptible  That therefore does not prove the proposition  replied Don Pompeyo  But  gentlemen  let us lay aside  I beseech you  the injudicious suffrages of the pit  they are often given
