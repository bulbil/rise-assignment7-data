testament—In it I have not forgot some proper remembrances for my father and mother  and  because I knew you would receive more pleasure on that account  I have not ordered any erasure to be made in an article that relates   92 to the wretched Louisa  Talking  my dear Miss Beauclerk  I find becomes inconvenient to me—Indulge me therefore at once  and consider  that to be generous  upon some occasions  may be the highest instance of barbarity     Whether I was right or wrong  my dear mama  you must determine  but  unable to resist his solicitations any longer  I took the paper with a reluctant hand  and  in my confusion  putting it into my bosom instead of my pocket  the colonel seemed transported at the action  kissed my hand a thousand times  and declared he could now quit the world with content  All the time I was sinking under a load of equal awkwardness and anxiety  till the surgeons happily coming in  gave me an opportunity of retiring  and unlading the fullness of my heart in a fresh shower of tears     93The good Mrs  Mildmay  knowing that I had been a considerable while in the colonel s apartment  came up to my room  and  finding my eyes extremely red  she threw her kind arms round my neck  and calling me by the tenderest appellations you can conceive  told me she had been long sensible that her son was passionately in love with me  and that she also had been long sensible  notwithstanding my delicate reserve   so she was pleased to say  that I considered him with an eye of affection—   But my sweet girl  my dear Harriot   continued she  finding me distressed and astonished at this information   don t imagine I have seen this mutual regard with any other regret  but my fear  that Mr  Mildmay would not be propitious to the happiness of his son  for my own part  I am so convinced of your worth  that the colonel has an additional share in my regard on   94 account of his attachment to you  and  could I but prevail upon his father  I should still have a daughter no less dear in my estimation than the miserable Louisa—But  my love  this family—pride so runs away with my poor Mr  Mildmay s good sense  that I despair of making him sacrifice the suggestions of his vanity to the sentiments of his reason  his mind has been always taken up with an idea of making his children great  and  so he could gain them an empty title  he payed but little consideration to what might secure their felicity     And thus  my dear mama  are matters at present situated  and thus  all the time that I have been supposing my affection for the colonel a secret  this excellent woman has seen into the most latent recesses of my heart  and even kindly sympathized with my anxiety    95 You may be sure  madam  that  after this excessive goodness had a little emboldened me  I made her acquainted with every circumstance which passed with the colonel  though I scarcely knew how to mention the affair of the will  as I thought she might fancy me on that account an enemy  though an involuntary one  to the interest of her family—But Mrs  Mildmay  madam  is a counterpart of yourself  she has a soul incapable of listening to any little considerations  and observes the practice of generosity too much in her own conduct not to love it in other people s—As I went on with my story she was gradually affected—her heart laboured—and her eye rose in perfect unison to mine  and  upon the conclusion of my narrative   Harriot   says she    the more I know you  the more I wish you for my daughter—My son has pleased me exceedingly by his conduct on this   96 occasion  and I think you would have acted rather below the dignity of your character  had you not condescended to oblige him  but  notwithstanding the little likelihood of present appearances  I have yet a dawn of hope which beams across my bosom  and assures me you shall one day be happy with the colonel—Had the unfortunate Louisa—But why do I afflict myself with recollecting a creature who now has really dishonoured us—Her scandalous elopement  in the very moment of her seeming penitence  argues an uncommon turpitude of sentiment  and shews that her first indiscretion was not so much the consequence of an extravagant tenderness for her lover  as the result of her natural depravity  God will  I hope  however  forgive the unhappy wretch her guilt  and mercifully incline to swell the   97 enormity of her crime  by putting down her death to my account     My unhappy Louisa —You may be sure  my dear mama  I did what I possibly could to alleviate the distresses of the venerable Mrs  Mildmay  at the same time that I said every thing which could extenuate the seeming misbehaviour of my friend  the good old lady seemed willing to catch at any twig of probability which might keep her hopes entirely from sinking  but  alas  the fatal force of appearances rendering the very strongest quite unequal to the task  she
