  You cannot   get from me  nor help yourself  Yet have I not offered any thing amiss   to you  But if you resolve not to comply with my proposals  I will not   lose this opportunity  If you do  I will yet leave you       O sir  said I  leave me  leave me but  and I will do any thing I ought   to do   Swear then to me  said he  that you will accept my proposals    With struggling  fright  terror  I fainted away quite  and did not come   to myself soon  so that they both  from the cold sweats that I was in    thought me dying   And I remember no more  than that  when with great   difficulty they brought me to myself  she was sitting on one side of the   bed  with her clothes on  and he on the other with his  and in his gown   and slippers       Your poor Pamela cannot answer for the liberties taken with her in her   deplorable state of death  And when I saw them there  I sat up in my   bed  without any regard to what appearance I made  and nothing about my   neck  and he soothing me  with an aspect of pity and concern  I put my   hand to his mouth  and said  O tell me  yet tell me not  what have I   suffered in this distress  And I talked quite wild  and knew not what    for  to be sure  I was on the point of distraction       He most solemnly  and with a bitter imprecation  vowed  that he had   not offered the least indecency  that he was frightened at the terrible   manner I was taken with the fit  that he should desist from his attempt    and begged but to see me easy and quiet  and he would leave me directly    and go to his own bed  O then  said I  take with you this most wicked   woman  this vile Mrs  Jewkes  as an earnest  that I may believe you       And will you  sir  said the wicked wretch  for a fit or two  give up   such an opportunity as this   I thought you had known the sex better    She is now  you see  quite well again       This I heard  more she might say  but I fainted away once more  at these   words  and at his clasping his arms about me again  And  when I came   a little to myself  I saw him sit there  and the maid Nan  holding a   smelling bottle to my nose  and no Mrs  Jewkes       He said  taking my hand  Now will I vow to you  my dear Pamela  that   I will leave you the moment I see you better  and pacified  Here s Nan   knows  and will tell you  my concern for you  I vow to God  I have   not offered any indecency to you  and  since I found Mrs  Jewkes so   offensive to you  I have sent her to the maid s bed  and the maid   shall be with you to night  And but promise me  that you will compose   yourself  and I will leave you  But  said I  will not Nan also hold my   hand  And will not she let you come in again to me   He said  By heaven    I will not come in again to night  Nan  undress yourself  go to bed  and   do all you can to comfort the dear creature  And now  Pamela  said he    give me but your hand  and say you forgive me  and I will leave you to   your repose  I held out my trembling hand  which he vouchsafed to kiss    and I said  God forgive you  sir  as you have been just in my distress    and as you will be just to what you promise  And he withdrew  with a   countenance of remorse  as I hoped  and she shut the doors  and  at my   request  brought the keys to bed       This  O my dear parents  was a most dreadful trial  I tremble still to   think of it  and dare not recall all the horrid circumstances of it  I   hope  as he assures me  he was not guilty of indecency  but have reason   to bless God  who  by disabling me in my faculties  empowered me to   preserve my innocence  and  when all my strength would have signified   nothing  magnified himself in my weakness       I was so
