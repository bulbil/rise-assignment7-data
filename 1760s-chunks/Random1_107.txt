body call you so  —   Got is my judge  replied he  captain Fifle did call me both  ay  and all the water in the Tawy will not wash it out of my remembrance —I do affirm  and avouch  and maintain  with my soul  and my pody  and my plood  look you  that I have no smells about me  but such as a christian ought to have  except the effluvia of topacco  which is a cephalic  odoriferous  aromatick herb  and he is a son of a mountain goat who says otherwise —As for my being a monster  let that be as it is  I am as Got was pleased to create me  which  peradventure  is more than I shall aver of him who gave me that title  for I will proclaim it before the world  that he is disguised  and transfigured  and transmographied with affectation and whimsies  and that he is more like a papoon than one of the human race        309  CHAP  XXXV   Captain Whiffle sends for me—his situation described—his surgeon arrives  prescribes for him  and puts him to bed—a bed is put up for Mr  Simper contiguous to the stateroom  which  with other parts of the captain s behaviour  gives the ship s company a very unfavourable idea of their commander—I am detained in the West Indies  by the admiral  and go on board of the Lizard sloop of war  in quality of surgeon s mate  where I make myself known to the Surgeon  who treats me very kindly—I go on shore  sell my ticket  purchase necessaries  and at my return on board  am surprized at the sight of Crampley  who is appointed lieutenant of the sloop—we sail on a cruize—take a prize  in which I arrive at Port Morant  under the command of my mess mate  with whom I live in great harmony   HE was going on  with an elogium upon the captain  when I received a message to clean myself  and go up to the great cabbin  which I immediately performed  sweetening myself with rose water from the medicine chest  When I entered the room  I was ordered to stand by   310 the door  until captain Whiffle had reconnoitred me at a distance  with a spy glass  who having consulted one sense in this manner  bid me advance gradually  that his nose might have intelligence  before it could be much offended  I therefore approached with great caution and success  and he was pleased to say     Ay  this creature is tolerable  —  I found him lolling on his couch with a languishing air  his head supported by his valet de chambre  who from time to time applied a smelling bottle to his nose —   Vergette   said he  in a squeaking tone  dost thou think this wretch  meaning me  will do me no injury  may I venture to submit my arm to him  —   Pon my vord   replied the valet  I do tink dat dere be great occasion for your honour losing one small quantite of blodt  and the yong mun ave qulque chose of de bonne mine —   Well then  said his master  I think I must venture  —  Then addressing himself to me    Hast thou ever blooded any body but brutes —But I need not ask thee  for thou wilt tell me a most damnable lie  —   Brutes  Sir   answered I  pulling down his glove in order to feel his pulse  I never meddle with brutes  —   What the devil art thou about   cried he  dost thou intend to twist off my hand  Gad s curse  my arm is benumbed up to the very shoulder  Heaven have mercy upon me  must I perish under the hands of savages  What an unfortunate dog was I to come on board without my own surgeon  Mr  Simper  —  I craved pardon for having handled him so roughly  and with the utmost care and tenderness tied up his arm with a fillet of silk  While I was seeling   311 for the vein  he desired to know how much blood I intended to take from him  and when I answered    Not above twelve ounces    started up with a look full of horror  and bid me begone  swearing I had a design upon his life —Vergette appeased him with some difficulty  and opening a bureau  took out a pair of scales  in one of which was placed a small cup  and putting them into my hand  told me  the captain never lost above an ounce and three drachms at one time —While I prepared for this important evacuation  there came into the cabbin  a young man  gayly dressed  of a very delicate complexion  with a kind of languid smile on his face  which seemed to have been rendered habitual  by a long course of affectation —The captain no sooner perceived him  than rising hastily  he flew into his arms  crying    O  my dear Simper  I am excessively disordered  I have been betrayed  frighted  murdered by the negligence of my servants
