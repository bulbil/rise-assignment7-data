 Sidney  I must blame you for this part of your conduct  it looks like a strange insensibility in you   I know you will urge your perfect submission to your mother’s will  and I know too  that will is as absolute as that of an Eastern monarch  I therefore repeat it  I do not mean to reproach you with your compliance  but I am vexed to the heart  and must give it vent   I see plainly that old piece of formality  lady Grimston’s infernal shrivelled paw in all this  For my mother of herself  I am sure  would not have thought of disposing of you  without your liking  so soon after an affair that had created you so much uneasiness  unless it had been suggested to her by somebody  Prithee tell me what sort of man this Arnold really is  for I do not depend on the partial representations I have had of him   I wish Miss B  were come to town  but she is not yet arrived  I enquired for her of Faulkland’s housekeeper  by the name of Jefferis  The woman is at the house at Putney waiting to receive her  but does not know how soon she will come  Would she had been buried before Faulkland saw her   I shall expect a letter from you soon  How comes it that you never mentioned Mr Arnold to me in any that you have writ  But I excuse you  and am  Your affectionate brother  G B   London  Sept  22   You see this is Sir George himself  my dear  a mixture of petulancy and indelicacy  There is one thing in him  however  commendable  his steady adherence to his friend’s interests  You find how impossible for me it is to shew such a letter to my mother  by his strange unguarded manner of writing  which he does not consider  he defeats his own purposes  for if any use could be made of that part of his letter relative to Miss B  I could not shew my mother part  without letting her see the whole  but that is not to be done  and I can only thank my good fortune that I received this  and the last letter from him  without her knowlege     I will now give you my answer to this letter  which I wrote  by the return of the post   Dear Brother   I thank you for your condolements  but can assure you my heart is not in such a situation as to require any  I own I had all the esteem for Mr Faulkland  which I thought his merit deserved  Duty to my good mother  and an undeniable blemish in his character  first wrought a change in my sentiments towards him  my own peace of mind now requires me to improve that change into indifference   You do me justice in supposing that I should never think of seeking a husband  and you have formed as right a judgment in regard to lady Grimston’s being the promoter of this union  As for Mr Arnold  though perhaps  had I never known your friend  he might not have been the man of my choice  yet have I no dislike to him  I believe him to be a very worthy gentleman  and that my mother has not been partial in her representations  I am sure  at least  she has said nothing of him but what she has seen  or been told  and has good reason to believe   I wish  dear brother  you had writ with more caution  that I might have laid before my mother what you said in relation to Miss B  It may have its weight with me  though I cannot answer for its having any with her  Do you forget her having told me  that she conceived a sort of horror at the thoughts of my marrying Mr Faulkland  She cannot but be sensible  that Miss B  is not without her share of blame in that affair  which has so perplexed us all  But you know too that does not exculpate Mr Faulkland  The young lady’s relinquishing her hopes  for a claim I think she does not make   would only the more excite my mother’s compassion  and interest her in her favour  To sum up the whole in one word  my mother is resolved  and you yourself acknowlege that her will is absolute  She has used the most irresistible argument to obtain my consent  viz  that it would make her happy  Spare then  my dear brother  unkind reflections on any part of my behaviour  for I am determined to pursue  through life  that rule of conduct  which I have hitherto invariably adhered to  I mean that of preferring to my own the happiness of those who are most dear to me   I am   c     September 25  Mr Arnold has so many advocates here  that his interest cannot fail of being promoted  Mrs Vere admires him  the Dean commends him  my mother praises him  lady Grimston extols him to the skies  No one is silent  but the young girl that I mentioned to you before  she only colours and hangs down her head when he is spoken of  I really begin
