but when the most urgent business   obliged him to it       One night happening to have stayed pretty late abroad  and in company    which occasioned his drinking more plentifully than he was accustomed    Louisa was retired to her chamber in order to go to bed  his love  ever   uppermost in his head  would not permit him to think of sleeping without   seeing her  accordingly he ran up into her room  and finding she was not   undressed  told her he had something to acquaint her with  on which the   maid that waited on her withdrew  Tho  the passion he was inspired with   could not be heightened  his behaviour now proved it might at least be   rendered more ungovernable by being enflamed with wine  He no sooner was   alone with her  than he threw himself upon her as she was sitting in a   chair  crying  O when my angel  my dear adored Louisa  will you consent   to make me blest   By heaven  I can no longer wait the tedious   formalities your modesty demands   I cannot think you hate me  and must   this night ensure you mine  While he spoke these words his lips were so   closely cemented to her s  that had there been no other hindrance  it   would have been impossible for her to have reply d   But terrified   beyond measure at the wild disorder of his looks  the expressions he   made use of  and the actions that accompanied them  she wanted even the   power of repulsing  till seeing her almost breathless  he withdrew his   arms which he had thrown round her neck  and contenting himself with   holding one of her hands   Tell me  pursued he  when may I hope a   recompence for all I have suffered   I must  I will have an end of all   these fears of offending   this cruel constaint   this distance between   us   Few men  Louisa  in the circumstances we both are  would  like me    so long attend a happiness in my power to seize   Trifle not therefore   with a passion  the consequences of which there is no answering for       O  sir  said she  with a trembling voice  you cannot  from the most   generous  virtuous and honourable man living  degenerate into a brutal   ravisher   You will not destroy the innocence you have cherished  and   which is all that is valuable in the poor Louisa  She ended these words   with a flood of tears  which  together with the sight of the confusion   he had occasioned  made him a little recollect himself  and to prevent   the wildness of his desires from getting the better of those rules he   had resolved to observe  he let go her hand  and having told her that he   would press her no farther that night  but expected a more satisfactory   answer the next day  went out of her chamber  and left her to enjoy what   repose she could after the alarm he had given her             CHAP  III        Dorilaus continues his importunities  with some unexpected consequences   that attended them        Poor Louisa concealed the distraction she was in as much as possible she   could from the maid  who immediately came into the room on Dorilaus   having quitted it  and suffered her to undress  and put her to bed as   usual  but was no sooner there  than instead of composing herself to   sleep  she began to reflect on what he had said   the words   that there   was no answering for the consequences of a passion such as his   gave   her the most terrible idea   His actions too  this night  seem d to   threaten her with all a virgin had to fear   She knew him a man of   honour  but thought she had too much reason to suspect that if she   persisted in refusing to be his wife  that passion which had influenced   him  contrary to his character  to make her such an offer  would also be   too potent for any consideration of her to restrain him from proceeding   to extremities  Having debated every thing within her own mind  she   thought she ought not to continue a day longer in the power of a man who   loved her to this extravagant degree  where to go indeed she knew   not   she had no friend  or even acquaintance  to whom she might repair    or hope to be received   How should she support herself then   which way   procure even the most common necessaries of life   This was a dreadful   prospect  yet appeared less so than that she
