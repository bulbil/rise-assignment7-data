 and was entitled to have a finger in the dissipation  As a young man  some little licence was allowable  and the ruinous consequences did not strike me at the time  Another reason  too  prevented me from taking notice of it  incessant vacancies  ecclesiastical and secular  paid me amply in meal and in malt  My surplus was increasing every day  Fortune s curricle seemed to have driven to my door  there to have broken down  and the driver to have taken shelter with me   One thing more was wanting to my complete intoxication  that Fabricio might be witness to my pomp  He was most probably come back from Andalusia  For the fun of surprising him  I sent an anonymous note  importing that a Sicilian nobleman of his acquaintance would be glad of his company to supper  with the day  hour  and place of appointment  which was at my house  Nunez came  and was most inordinately astonished to recognize me in the Sicilian nobleman  Yes  my friend  said I  behold the master of this family  I have a retinue  a good table  and a strong box besides  Is it possible  exclaimed he with vivacity  that all this opulence should be yours  It was well done in me to have placed you with Count Galiano  I told you beforehand that he was a generous nobleman  and would not be long before he set you at your ease  Of course you followed my wise advice  in giving the rein a little more freely to your servants  you find the benefit of it  It is only by a little mutual accommodation  that the principal officers in great houses feather their nests so comfortably   I suffered Fabricio to go on as long as he liked  complimenting himself for having introduced me to Count Galiano  When he had done  to chastise his ecstasies at having procured me so good a post  I stated at full length the returns of gratitude with which that nobleman had recompensed my services  But  perceiving how ready my poet was to string his lyre to satire at my recital  I said to him    The Sicilian s contemptible conduct I readily forgive  Between ourselves  it is more a subject of congratulation than of regret  If the count had dealt honourably by me  I should have followed him into Sicily  where I should still be in a subordinate capacity  waiting for dead men s shoes  In a word  I should not now have been hand in glove with the Duke of Lerma   Nunez felt so strange a sensation at these last words  that he was tongue tied for some seconds  Then gulping  up his stammering accents like harlequin  Did I hear aright  said he  What  you hand in glove with the prime minister  I on one side  and Don Rodrigo de Calderona on the other  answered I  and according to all appearance  my fortunes will move higher  Truly  replied he  this is admirable  You are cut out for every occasion  What an universal genius  To borrow an expression from the tennis court  you have a racket for every ball  nothing comes amiss to you  At all events  my lord  I am sincerely rejoiced at your lordship s prosperity  The deuce and all  Master Nunez  interrupted I  good now  dispense with your lords and lordships  Let us banish such formalities  and live on equal terms together  You are in the right  replied he  altered circumstances should not make strange faces  I will own my weakness  when you announced your elevation you took away my breath  but the chill and the shudder are over  and I see only my old friend Gil Blas   Our conversation was interrupted by the arrival of four or five clerks  Gentlemen  said I  introducing Nunez  you are to sup with Signor Don Fabricio  who writes verses of impenetrable sublimity  and such prose as would not know itself in the glass  Unluckily I was talking to gentry who would have had more fellow feeling with an Oran Outang than with a poet They scarcely condescended to look at him  In vain did he pun  parody  rally  or rail to hit their fancies  for they had none  He was so nettled at their indifference  that he assumed the poetic licence  and made his escape  Our clerks never missed him  but forgot at once that he had been there   Just as I was going out the next morning  the poet of the Asturias came into my room  I beg pardon  said he  for having cut your clerks so abruptly last night  but  to deal freely  I was so much out of my element  that I should soon have played old chaos with them  Proud puppies  with their starch and self important air  I cannot conceive how a clever fellow like you can sit it out with such loutish guests  To day I will bring you some of more life and spirit  I shall be very much obliged to you  answered I  your introduction is sufficient  Exactly so  replied he  You shall have the feast of reason and the flow of soul  I will go forthwith and invite them  for
