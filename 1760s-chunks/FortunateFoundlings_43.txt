innocence inspire  Charlotta  of late so timid and   alarmed while she thought Horatio was in question  was now all calmness   and composure  when she found de Coigney the person for whom she had   been suspected  She confessed to her father  with the most settled brow    that he had indeed made some offers of an affection for her  but said    she had given him such answers  as nothing but the height of arrogance   and folly could interpret to his advantage  and then  on the baron s   commanding her  acquainted him with every particular that had passed   between that young gentleman  his sister  and herself  touching the   affair she was accused of       She was so minute in every circumstance  answered with such readiness to   all the questions he asked of her  and seemed so perfectly at ease  as   indeed she was  that the baron could no longer have any doubts of her   sincerity  and was sorry he had taken her so abruptly from St  Germains    he now told her  that she was at liberty to visit there as frequently as   she pleased  only  as he had been affronted by old monsieur de Coigney    as well as to silence all future reports concerning the young gentleman    he expected she would break off all acquaintance with mademoiselle  She   assured him of her obedience in this point  and added  that she could do   it without any difficulty  for tho  she was a lady who had many good   qualities  and one for whom she once had a friendship  yet the taking   upon her to forward her brother s designs had occasioned a strangeness   between them  which had already more than half anticipated his commands       Monsieur the baron de Palfoy was now as well satisfied with his daughter   as he had lately been the reverse  and she was allowed once more all   those innocent liberties which the French ladies  above those of any   other nation in the world  enjoy       It is not to be doubted but that the first use she made of liberty was   to go to St  Germains  she had heard from mademoiselle de Coigney  when   she came to visit her  that Horatio had been very much indisposed  and   at that time was not quite recovered  and was impatient to give him all   the consolation that the sight of her could afford  but fearing she   should not have an opportunity of speaking to him in private  she wrote   a letter  containing a full recital of the reason which had induced her   father to take her from St  Germains  and the happy mistake he had been   in concerning de Coigney  concluding with letting him know he might   sometimes visit her at Paris as an indifferent acquaintance  not the   least suspicion being entertained of him  and the baron now in so good a   humour with her  that it would not be easy for any one to make him give   credit to any informations to her prejudice  The whole was dictated by a   spirit of tenderness  which  tho  it did not plainly confess an   affection  implied every thing an honourable lover could either   expect or hope       On her arrival at St  Germains  where there was an extreme full court to   congratulate the princess Louisa  on the great victories lately gained   by Charles XII  the brave king of Sweeden  to whom she had been some   time contracted  she passed directly to her highness s apartment  and   the Chevalier St  George being then with her  those of his Gentlemen who   had attended him thither  were waiting in the antichamber  among them   was Horatio  the alteration of his countenance on sight of her  after   this absence  was too visible not to have been remarked  had not all   present been too busy in paying their compliments to her  to take any   notice of it  He was one of the last that approached  being willing to   recover the confusion he felt himself in  lest it should have an effect   on his voice in speaking to her  She  more prepared  received his salute   with the same gay civility she did the others  but at the same instant   slipped the letter she had brought with her into his hand       Any one who is in the least acquainted with the power of love  may guess   the transports of Horatio at this condescension  but  impatient to know   the dear contents  he went out of the room as soon as he found he could   do it without being observed  and having perused this obliging billet    found in it a sufficient cordial to revive that long languishment his   spirit had been in
