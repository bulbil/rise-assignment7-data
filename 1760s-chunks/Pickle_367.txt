giddy  unthinking  man  was so much incensed at these insinuations  that  in the first  transports of his passion  he sent to his mother a power of attorney   that she might sue for a divorce in his behalf  A libel was thereupon  exhibited  containing many scandalous allegations  void of any real  foundation in truth  but being unsupported by any manner of proof  it  was at length dismissed with costs  after it had depended upwards of two  years    Lord A   finding himself abused by the misrepresentations of his mother  and sister  discovered an inclination to be reconciled to his lady  In  consequence of which  she was sent over to Dublin by her father  to the  care of a gentleman in that city  in whose house she was received by her  husband with all the demonstrations of love and esteem  From thence he  conducted her to his lodgings  and thence to his country house  where  she had the misfortune to suffer a miscarriage  through fear and  resentment of my lord s behaviour  which was often brutal and indecent   From the country they removed to Dublin  about the latter end of July   or beginning of August  1714  where they had not long continued  when  her ladyship was known to be again with child    Lord A   and his issue being next in remainder to the honours and  estate of Arthur  earl of A    was extremely solicitous to have a son   and  warned by the frequent miscarriages of his lady  resolved to curb  the natural impatience and rusticity of his disposition  that she might  not  as formerly  suffer by his outrageous conduct  He accordingly  cherished her with uncommon tenderness and care  and her pregnancy being  pretty far advanced  conducted her to his country seat  where she was  delivered of Mr  A    about the latter end of April  or beginning of  May  for none of the witnesses have been able  at this distance  with  absolute certainty to fix the precise time of his birth  and there  was no register kept in the parish  As an additional misfortune  no  gentleman of fashion lived in that parish  nor did those who lived at  any considerable distance care to cultivate an acquaintance with a man  of Lord A   s strange conduct    Be that as it will  the occasion was celebrated by his lordship s  tenants and dependents upon the spot  and in the neighbouring town of  New R    by bonfires  illuminations  and other rejoicings  which have  made such an impression upon the minds of the people  that in the  place where they happened  and the contiguous parishes  several hundred  persons have already declared their knowledge and remembrance of this  event  in spite of the great power of the claimant s adversary in  that quarter  and the great pains and indirect methods taken by his  numberless agents and emissaries  as well as by those who are interested  with him in the event of the suit  to corrupt and suppress the evidence     6 22 15  3 45 PM    Lord A    after the birth of his son  who was sent to nurse in the  neighbourhood  according to the custom of the country  where people of  the highest distinction put their children out to nurse into farmhouses  and cabins  lived in harmony with his lady for the space of two years   But having  by his folly and extravagance  reduced himself to great  difficulties  he demanded the remainder of her fortune from her father   the duke of B    who absolutely refused to part with a shilling until a  proper settlement should be made on his daughter  which  by that time   he had put out of his own power to make  by his folly and extravagance    As her ladyship  by her endeavours to reform the economy of her house   had incurred the displeasure of some idle profligate fellows  who  had fastened themselves upon her husband  and helped to consume his  substance  they seized this opportunity of the duke s refusal  and  in  order to be revenged upon the innocent lady  persuaded Lord A    that  the only means of extracting money from his grace  would be to turn her  away  on pretence of infidelity to his bed  for which they hinted there  was but too much foundation  At their suggestions  a most infamous  plan was projected  in the execution of which  one P    a poor  unbred   simple country booby  whom they had decoyed into a snare  lost one of  his ears  and the injured lady retired that same day to New R    where  she continued several years  She did not  however  leave the house   without struggling hard to carry her child along with her  but far from  enjoying such indulgence  strict orders were given  that the boy should  not  for the future  be brought
