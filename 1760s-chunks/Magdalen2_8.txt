if he should kill his antagonist  he must forfeit his own life to the violated laws of his country—I say  when these things are considered  and when it is   43 moreover recollected  that  though the lenity of the laws should spare the life of your son  it can by no means restore your peace  I am in hopes that your own good sense will induce you to abate the warmth of your indignation  and that you will prefer a certain felicity to a precarious revenge—Justice  you see  by the colonel s unfortunate wound  may sometimes be unattended with success  and should you still prosecute a quarrel with a man who desires  who supplicates  who implores to make every reparation that can be made  the world will think your resentment carried to an unreasonable length  and be apt even to rejoice should you meet with any new calamity       To the arguments which I have already offered  my dear Mr  Mildmay  I have another very forcible   44 plea to add  which I am sure must operate on your tenderness  as a husband  and upon your justice  as a man —Turn  Sir  to this venerable  this excellent woman  the companion of your youth  the partner of your sorrows  the possessor of your heart—see where she is  sinking under the sternness of your resolution  and bleeding with an apprehension of future misfortunes  as well as with a sensibility of the present distress—She  Sir  has a mother s claim in the son  whose life you are so willing to expose  Do not drive her into absolute distraction—Her anguish is already excessive  and her death must be inevitable  if you think of washing away her daughter s stain with nothing but the blood of her son  On my knees  therefore  Mr  Mildmay   and down the wonderful woman dropped   let me beg of you to think of a reconciliation    45 —My brother is deeply wounded by the consciousness of his own guilt  and will  I am certain  from motives of gratitude  as well as affection  make a good son  and a deserving husband  Do not  my dear Mr  Mildmay  because one affliction has interrupted your happiness  rashly devote yourself to wretchedness for life  but rather seize the best means of dispelling the cloud which at present overcasts your peace  and endeavour at recovering the genial sunshine of that tranquility which has been so recently and so fatally lost     Mr  Mildmay  who all the time of your sister s kneeling  in vain attempted to raise her up  seemed greatly struck with what she said  but  though his reason was convinced  his pride nevertheless held an obstinate struggle  and he several times attempted to quit the   46 room—Lady Haversham and I as often prevented him from going out  we prevailed upon him with difficulty  to hear the principal part of your letter read  and Mrs  Mildmay herself kneeling to him  and in very pathetic terms requesting him to oblige lady Haversham  he was at last overcome  and consented that you might be sent for as soon as we pleased  desiring only that the ceremony might be delayed till the recovery of the colonel   When we had thus settled the material affair  our conversation naturally turned upon the colonel s case  and the abilities of his attendants —Mr  Mildmay said  that  though the wound at first appeared extremely dangerous  as it was very near the groin  nevertheless  the surgeons now told him  that there was but little doubt of a fine cure  provided he escaped a fever—   47  And this  said the old gentleman    I am no way uneasy about  as the weather is very cold and his pulse so very temperate  but   added he   suppose you go and see him  there is nobody with him but Miss Beauclerk  and he had so fine a morning s sleep that we shan t in the least fatigue him with our company   We accordingly went  and were received  as I expected  with great coldness  though with great civility—The sight of people so very near to you naturally hurting that impatience which we all labour under where we have received any thing which looks like a disgrace  Lady Haversham  however  went up to him as if she had been his sister  and expressed her concern for the cause of his misfortune  with so unaffected an air of cordiality as reconciled him a little to his visitors  We then acquainted him with the business of our journey  talked matters over again  and   48 read all your letter but that part where the provision for his sister is mentioned  he was extremely attentive to your account of the duel  and begged more than once to hear a repetition of some particular passages  When I had done  he paused a little  and said  you were very exact in the relation  and that  had he imagined you were actuated by a sincere concern for your indiscretion  and were really going up to town with a view of entreating Louisa s forgiveness  he would not have been so rash   But   says he   my heart was in the match—and to find every
