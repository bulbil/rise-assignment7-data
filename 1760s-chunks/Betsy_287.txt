 in reality  much more in   awe of him  than he affected to be of her  she turned her eyes   continually towards the door  in hopes of seeing Mr  Munden enter  and   never had she wished for his presence with the impatience she now did       The noble lord equally dreaded his return  and finding the replies she   made to his pressures somewhat more moderate than they had been on the   first opening his suit  flattered himself that a very little compulsion   would compleat the work  he therefore resolved to dally no longer  and   having ushered in his design with a prelude of some warm kisses and   embraces  was about to draw her into another room       She struggled with all her might  but her efforts that way being in   vain  she shrieked  and called aloud for help  This a little shocked   him  he let her go   What do you mean  Madam   said he   Would you   expose yourself and me to the ridicule of my servants     I will expose   myself to any thing   answered she   rather than to the ruin and   everlasting infamy your lordship is preparing for me         Call not by so harsh a name   cried he   the effects of the most tender   passion that ever was  by heavens  I love you more than life  nay  life   without you is not worth the keeping   Speaking these words  he was   about to lay hold of her again  and her cries having brought no body to   her assistance  she must infallibly have been lost  if her better angel   had not in that instant directed her eyes to a bell which hung in the   pannel of the wainscot just behind the door of the room into which he   was forcing her  she snatched the handle  and rung it with such   vehemence that it resounded through the house       This action made him release her with a kind of indignant fling  and a   servant immediately coming up   I believe   said she to him   my servant   is below  pray order him to call me a chair this moment   The peer  not   often accustomed to such rebuffs  was so much confounded at the strength   of her resolution  that he had not power to utter one word  and she    fearing another assault  ran to the door  which the footman hastily shut   after him  and having opened it   Your lordship   said she   has used me   in a manner neither worthy of yourself nor me  I leave you to blush at   the remembrance        She waited not to hear what reply he would have made  but flew down   stairs into the hall  where a chair being presently brought  she threw   herself into it  extremely disconcerted in her dress as well as mind                CHAPTER XIV       Contains a brief recital of several very remarkable  and equally   affecting  occurrences  of which the last mentioned extraordinary   adventure was productive  and which may justly enough be looked upon as   yet more extraordinary than even the adventure itself          Mr  Munden  who was no less pleased and vain on the confidence his noble   patron seemed to repose in him  than he was ambitious of the favours he   hoped to receive from him  had been extremely diligent in the execution   of that commission he had been entrusted with  but found much more   difficulty in it than he could have imagined       He was told at the bar of the Cocoa Tree  that the gentleman he inquired   for had not been there since morning  that Sir John F     had taken him   home with him to dinner  and that in all probability they were still   together       Mr  Munden  on this  ordered the coachman to drive to Mark Lane  with   all the speed he could  but had  on his coming there  the mortification   to hear that Mr  W     had left Sir John about a quarter of an hour   before  and was gone to the other end of the town  on which he drove   back to the Cocoa Tree  thinking he might now meet him there  but was   again disappointed       They informed him  however  that Mr  W     had just called in  but staid   no longer than to tell them he would be there again in half an hour  Mr    Munden was impatient at this delay  but could not think
