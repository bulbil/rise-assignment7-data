in and about this house bears now    to my thinking  to what it once had  The garden  the pond  the alcove    the elm walk  But  oh  my prison is become my palace  and no wonder   every thing wears another face       We sat down upon the broad stile  leading towards the road  and Mrs    Jewkes was quite another person to me  to what she was the last time I   sat there       At last my best beloved returned  and alighted there  What  my Pamela     and Mrs  Jewkes then left me   What  said he  and kissed me  brings   you this way  I hope to meet me   Yes  sir  said I  That s kind  indeed    said he  but why that averted eye   that downcast countenance  as if you   was afraid of me  You must not think so  sir  said I  Revive my heart   then  said he  with a more cheerful aspect  and let that over anxious   solicitude  which appears in the most charming face in the world  be   chased from it   Have you  my dear girl any fears that I can dissipate    any doubts that I can obviate  any hopes that I can encourage  any   request that I can gratify   Speak  my dear Pamela  and if I have power    but speak  and to purchase one smile  it shall be done       I cannot  sir  said I  have any fears  any doubts  but that I shall   never be able to deserve all your goodness  I have no hopes  but that   my future conduct may be agreeable to you  and my determined duty well   accepted  Nor have I any request to make  but that you will forgive all   my imperfections and  among the rest  this foolish weakness  that makes   me seem to you  after all the generous things that have passed  to want   this further condescension  and these kind assurances  But indeed  sir    I am oppressed by your bounty  my spirits sink under the weight of it    and the oppression is still the greater  as I see not how  possibly    in my whole future life  by all I can do  to merit the least of your   favours       I know your grateful heart  said he  but remember  my dear  what the   lawyers tell us  That marriage is the highest consideration which the   law knows  And this  my sweet bride  has made you mine  and me yours    and you have the best claim in the world to share my fortune with me    But  set that consideration aside  what is the obligation you have to   me  Your mind is pure as that of an angel  and as much transcends mine    Your wit  and your judgment  to make you no compliment  are more than   equal to mine  You have all the graces that education can give a woman    improved by a genius which makes those graces natural to you  You have   a sweetness of temper  and a noble sincerity  beyond all comparison  and   in the beauty of your person  you excel all the ladies I ever saw  Where   then  my dearest  is the obligation  if not on my side to you   But  to   avoid these comparisons  let us talk of nothing henceforth but equality    although  if the riches of your mind  and your unblemished virtue  be   set against my fortune   which is but an accidental good  as I may call   it  and all I have to boast of   the condescension will be yours  and   I shall not think I can possibly deserve you  till  after your sweet   example  my future life shall become nearly as blameless as yours       O  sir  said I  what comfort do you give me  that  instead of my being   in danger of being ensnared by the high condition to which your goodness   has exalted me  you make me hope  that I shall be confirmed and approved   by you  and that we may have a prospect of perpetuating each other s   happiness  till time shall be no more   But  sir  I will not  as you   once cautioned me  be too serious  I will resolve  with these sweet   encouragements  to be  in every thing  what you would have me be  And I   hope I shall  more and more  shew you that I have no will but yours  He   kissed me very tenderly  and thanked me for this kind assurance  as
