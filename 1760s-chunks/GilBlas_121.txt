regained the Palermo road  in more distress and perplexity than ever  Getting home some little time before daybreak  his apartment afforded him the most quiet retreat  But his thoughts were all on the road back to Belmonte  The resting place of his affections  a sense of honour  in a word  love with all its pretensions and surmises  would never allow him to delay an explanation  involving all the circumstances of so strange and melancholy an adventure   As soon as it was daylight he gave out that he was going on a hunting expedition  Under cover of sporting  his huntsmen and a chosen party of his courtiers penetrated into the forest of Belmonte under his direction  The chase was followed for some time  as a blind to his real design  When he saw the whole party eagerly driving on  and wholly engrossed by the sport  he galloped off in a different direction  and struck  without any attendants  into the road towards Leontio s castle  The various tracks of the forest were too well known to him to admit of his losing his way  His impatience  too  would not allow him to take any thought of his horse  so that the moments scarcely flitted faster  than his expedition in leaving behind him the distance which separated him from the object of his love  His very soul was on the rack for some plausible excuse to plead for a private interview with Siffredi s daughter  when  crossing a narrow path just at the park gate  he observed two women sitting close by him  in earnest conversation under the shelter of a tree  It might well be supposed that these females belonged to the castle  and even that probability was sufficient to rouse an interest in him  But his emotion was heightened into a feeling beyond his reason to control  for these ladies happened to look round on hearing the trot of a horse advancing in that direction  when at once he recognized his dear Blanche  The fact was  she had made her escape from the castle with Nisa  the person of all others among her women most in her confidence  that she might at least have the satisfaction of weeping over her misfortunes without intrusion or restraint   He flew  and seemed rather to throw himself headlong than to fall at her feet  But when he beheld in the expression of her countenance every mark of the deepest affliction  his heart was softened  Lovely Blanche  said he  do not  let me entreat you  give way to the emotions of your grief  Appearances  I own  must represent me as guilty in your eyes  but when you shall be made acquainted with my project in your behalf  what you consider as a crime will be transformed in your thoughts into a proof of my innocence  and an evidence of my unparalleled affection  These words  calculated  according to the views of Enriquez  to allay the grief of Blanche  served only to redouble her affliction  Fain would she have answered  but her sobs stifled her utterance  The prince  thunderstruck at the death like agitation of her flame  addressed her thus  What  madam  is there no possibility of tranquilizing your agitation  By what sad mischance have I lost your confidence  at the very moment when my crown and even my life are at stake  in consequence of my resolution to hold myself engaged to you  At this suggestion the daughter of Leontio  doing violence to her own feelings  but thinking it necessary to explain herself  said to him    My liege  your assurances are no longer admissible  My destiny and yours are henceforward as far asunder as the poles  Ah  Blanche  interrupted Enriquez with impatience  what cutting words are these  too painful for my sense of hearing  Who dares step in between our loves  Who would venture to stand forward against the headlong rage of a king who would kindle all Sicily into a conflagration  rather than suffer you to be ravished from his long cherished hopes  All your power  my liege  great as it is  replied the daughter of Siffredi in a tone of melancholy  becomes inefficient against the obstacles in the way of our union  I know not how to tell it you  but         I am married to the constable   Married to the constable  exclaimed the prince  starting back to some distance from her  He could proceed no further in his discourse  so completely was he thunderstruck at the intelligence  Overwhelmed by this unexpected blow  he felt his strength forsake him  His unconscious limbs laid themselves without his guidance against the trunk of a tree just behind him  His countenance was pallid  his whole frame in a tremor  his mind bewildered and his spirits depressed  With no sense or faculty at liberty but that of gazing  and there every power of his soul was suspended on Blanche  he made her feel most poignantly how he himself was agonized by the fatal event she had announced  The expression of countenance on her part was such as to show him that her emotions were not uncongenial with his own  Thus did these two distressed lovers for a time preserve a silence towards each other  which portended something of terror in its calmness  At length the
