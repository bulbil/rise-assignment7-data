with the first  upon Principles which he denies you  and it would be a Jest to reason with the other at all   After this Reflection  I do not look upon Suicide in that shocking Light which other People do  For  with Regard to the Atheist  I fear it is pretty equal  to his poor Soul  after what Manner he dies  and  as to the Madman  I throw him upon his Mercy  who could  had he pleased  have   made Reason rule  and Passion be it s Slave     Page  36  LETTER CXCII  HENRY to FRANCES             I talked of dying  better Thoughts come forward   and since the Satisfaction I have had in this Day has made me somewhat more in Love with Life  I shall here give you a Supplement to my last Letter  lest you should imagine I was quite of a different Opinion from Watts  because I did not allow his Reasoning to be sufficiently strong upon the Subject     I do not look upon Suicide  or indeed upon any Act  in the Light that Divines do  as criminal in itself  but regard all Actions  in a general View  as indifferent in themselves  for the same Thing may be virtuous at one Time  and vicious at another  So that the Difference seems to lie merely in Circumstance  I think  with Deference to the Pulpit  that whoever understands the Nature of Vice in any other Sense  impiously charges God with having originally generated Evil  Now  with Regard to this particular Instance we are upon  I consider a Suicide not as guilty of a particular Crime  but of so Page  37 much Vice  as the moral Consequences of the Act leave him chargeable with  And the Chain is so extensive  and the Dependencies so nice  in this Life  that very few Men can be free enough  from Relation or Contingency  to be perfectly clear from Guilt in this Act  And  so far as it is a Crime  it is of the highest Nature so  as it has the Aggravation of Presumption  the Sin of acting against Nature  and the Impossibility of Repentance   However there may be particular Instances where the Thing may be indifferent in itself  yet  even here  though the Action be innocent  the Turn of Mind  which prompts to it  must be extremely vicious  It argues an Impatience and Rashness  which are the Signs of an Intemperance of Soul  a Disregard to the Opinion of this World  which every good Man should have Respect for  or a Despair of God s Providence  which a Man of Philosophy or Religion should never betray   There are  I think  but three Things which can provoke a Person to this desperate Act  Pain  Poverty  or Shame  If from the first Circumstance  then he has forgot what all the Trials in this Life were intended for  and so foolishly refuses that Physic  which may give him Health to Immortality  If from the second  it is owing to a false Pride  and an unchristian Spirit  joined to a Habit of Idleness  which Page  38 creates a slothful Despondency  If from the third  he but seals his Name with Infamy  makes that Shame the more public  and deprives himself of any Opportunity of retrieving his Character  It was finely said  by some great Man  upon hearing Libels had been wrote against him    I will live so  as to give the Lye to their Reproach     Suppose a Criminal  leading forth to Execution  even he shall have no Power over his own Life  though already forfeited and condemned  for he adds to his Crime  by rebelling against the Laws of his Country  and deprives the Community of a wholesome Example of public Justice  Beside  as all human Inflictions may be considered as Trials of our Virtue  so may even legal Punishments  if undergone with Resignation  Contrition  and Hope  be considered as Attonements for our Crimes   Thus you see  that even in the most indifferent Case  though the Action itself may be morally innocent  yet it can never be performed but by a vicious Actor   In short  it is an Action contrary to the Laws of God and Man  The first  without recurring to Authorities  may be proved from the natural Abhorrence we find in ourselves from the Act  which  to Demonstration  shews the Sense of Providence about the Matter  And the second we know from the general Sense of Mankind  Page  39 who have endeavoured to deter from  by affixing Ignominy upon it  the only Way of dealing with the Dead   But all these Reflections may not occur to a Man in the Hurry of the Act  for there are but few deliberate Suicides  Yet surely any Moment of Time may afford us Leisure for this short Expostulation    What if it should be a Crime  Then  great God  how shocking must his Situation be  whose Conviction comes too late for Repentance     Henry   P  S  Keep this Letter for me   LETTER CXCIII   Dear FANNY
