what will she get by her wit   JUST this moment she came into my closet—Writing  Emily  said she  To whom —I told her —Don t tell tales out of school  Emily —I was so afraid that she would have asked to see what I had written  But she did not  To be sure she is very polite  and knows what belongs to herself  and every body else  To be ungenerous  as you once said  to her husband only  that is a very sad thing to think of   Well  and I would give any thing to know if you think what I have written tolerable  before I go any farther  But I will go on in this way  since I cannot do better  Bad is my best  but you shall have quantity  I warrant  since you bid me write long Letters   But I have seen my mother  It was but yesterday  She was in a mercer s shop in Covent Garden  I was in Lord L  s chariot  only Anne was with me  Anne saw her first  I alighted  and asked her blessing in the shop  I am sure I did right  She blessed me  and called me dear love  I stay d till she had bought what she wanted  and then I slid down the money  as   237 if it were her own doing  and glad I was I had so much about me  It came but to four guineas  I begged her  speaking low  to forgive me for so doing  And finding she was to go home as far as Soho  and had thoughts of having a hackney coach called  I gave Anne money for a coach for herself  and waited on my mother to her own lodgings  and it being Lord L  s chariot  she was so good as to dispense with my alighting   She blessed my guardian all the way  and blessed me  She said  she would not ask me to come to see her  because it might not be thought proper  as my guardian was abroad  But she hoped  she might be allowed to come and see me sometimes —Was she not very good  madam  But my guardian s goodness makes every body good —O that my mamma had been always the same  I should have been but too happy   God bless my guardian  for putting me on enlarging her power to live handsomely  Only as a coach brings on other charges  and people must live accordingly  or be discredited  instead of credited  by it  or I should hope the additional Two hundred a year might afford them one  Yet one does not know but Mr  O Hara may have been in debt before he married her  and I fansy he has people who hang upon him  But if it pleases God  I will not  when I am at age  and have a coach of my own  suffer my mother to walk on foot  What a blessing is it  to have a guardian that will second every good purpose of one s heart   Lady Olivia is rambling about  and I suppose she will wait here in England till Sir Charles s return  But I am sure he never will have her  A wicked wretch  with her poniards  Yet it is pity  She is a fine woman  But I hate her for her expectation  as well as for her poniard  And a woman to leave her own country  to seek for a husband  I could die before I could do so  tho  to such a man as my guardian    238 Yet once I thought I could have liked to have lived with her at Florence  She has some good qualities  and is very generous  and in the main well esteemed in her own country  every body knew she loved my guardian  But I don t know how it is  nobody blamed her for it  vast as the difference in fortune then was  But that is the glory of being a virtuous man  to love him is a credit  instead of a shame  O madam  Who would not be virtuous  And that not only for their own  but for their friends sakes  if they loved their friends  and wished them to be well thought of   Lord W  is very desirous to hasten his wedding   Mr  Beauchamp says  that all the Mansfields  He knows them  bless my guardian every day of their lives  and their enemies tremble  He has commissions from my guardian to enquire and act in their cause  that no time may be lost to do them service  against his return   We have had another visit from Lady Beauchamp  and have returned it  She is very much pleased with us  You see I say us  Indeed my two dear Ladies are very good to me  but I have no merit  It is all for their brother s sake   Mr  Beauchamp tells us  just now  that his mother in law has joined with his father  at her own motion  to settle 1000 l  a year upon him  I am glad of it  with all my heart  Are not you
