 hell  I suppose   replied the other  with great deliberation     while the purser fell on his knees and begged of heaven that we might not all perish for the sake of one Jonas —During this dialogue  I cloathed myself in my best apparel  girded on my hanger  stuck my pistols loaded in my belt  disposed of all my valuable moveables about my person  and came upon deck  with a resolution of taking the first opportunity to get on shore  which  when the day broke  appeared at the distance of three miles a head —Crampley finding his efforts to get the ship off ineffectual  determined to consult his own safety  by going into the boat  which he had no sooner done  than the ship s company followed so fast  that she would have sunk along side  had not some one wiser than the rest cut the rope and put off —But before this happened  I had made several attempts to get in  and was always baulked by the captain  who was so eager in excluding me  that he did not mind the endeavours of any other body —Enraged at this inhuman partiality  and seeing the rope cut  I pulled one of my pistols from my belt  and cocking it  swore I would shoot any man who should presume to obstruct my entrance  So saying  I leaped with my full exertion  and got on board of the boat with the loss of the skin of one of my shins —I chanced in my descent to overturn Crampley  who no sooner got up than he struck at me several times with a cutlass  and ordered the men to   6 throw me overboard  but they were too anxious about their own safety to mind what he said —Though the boat was very deeply loaded  and the sea terribly high  we made shift to get upon dry land in less than an hour after we parted from the sloop —As soon as I set foot on terra firma  my indignation  which had boiled so long within me  broke out against Crampley  whom I immediately challenged to single combat  presenting my pistols  that he might take his choice  He took one without hesitation  and before I could cock the other fired in my face throwing the pistol after the shot —I felt myself stunned  and imagining the bullet had entered my brain  discharged mine as quick as possible  that I might not die unrevenged  then flying upon my antagonist  knocked out several of his fore teeth with the but end of the piece  and would certainly have made an end of him with that instrument  had he not disengaged himself  and seized his cutlass  which he had given to his servant when he received the pistol  Seeing him armed in this manner  I drew my hanger  and having flung my pistol at his head  closed with him in a transport of fury  and thrust my weapon into his mouth  which it enlarged on one side to his ear —Whether the smart of this wound disconcerted him  or the unevenness of the ground made him reel  I know not  but he staggered some paces back  I followed close  and with one stroke cut the tendons of the back of his hand  upon which his cutlass dropt  and he remained defenceless —I know not with what cruelty my rage might have inspired me  if I had not at that instant  been felled to the ground by a blow on the back part of my head  which deprived me   7 of all sensation —When I received the use of my understanding  I found myself alone in a desolate place  stript of my cloaths  money  watch  buckles  and every thing but my shoes  stockings  breeches  and shirt —What a discovery must this be to me  who but an hour before  was worth sixty guineas in cash  I cursed the hour of my birth  the parents that gave me being  the sea that did not swallow me up  the poignard of the enemy  which could not find the way to my heart  the villainy of those who had left me in that miserable condition  and in the exstacy of despair  resolved to lie still where I was and perish     CHAP  XXXVIII    I get up  and crawl into a barn  where I am in danger of perishing thro  the fear of the country people—their inhumanity—I am succoured by a reputed witch—her story—her advice—she recommends me as a valet to a single lady  whose character she explains   BUT as I lay ruminating  my passion insensibly abated  I considered my situation in quite another light from that in which it appeared to me at first  and the result of my deliberation was to get up if I could  and crawl to the next inhabited place for assistance —With some difficulty I got upon my legs  and having examined my body  found I had received no other injury than two large contused wounds  one on the   8 fore and another on the hinder part of my head  which seemed to be occasioned by the same weapon  namely  the butt end of a pistol  I looked towards the sea  but could discern no remains of the ship  which made me conclude she had gone to
