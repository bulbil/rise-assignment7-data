to posterity  What confounded nonsense  rejoined the old fellow  whose ideas were all pecuniary  You are already become a fixture in the hospital  and are made of a metal which may easily be manufactured into a steward  or by good luck even into a governor  You are going to give up the great object of life  and to flutter about its frippery  So much the worse for you  honest friend   The governor  seeing how fruitless it was to struggle with my fixed resolve  paid me my wages  and made me a present of fifty ducats as an acknowledgment of my services  Thus  between this supply and what I have been able to scrape together out of some little commissions  which were assigned to me from an opinion of my disinterestedness  I was in circumstances to make a very pretty appearance on my arrival at Madrid  which I was not negligent in doing  though the literary tribe in our country are not over punctilious about decency or cleanliness  I soon got acquainted with Lope de Vega  Cervantes  and the whole set of them  but though they were fine fellows  and thought so by the public  I chose for my model in preference  Don Lewis de Gongora  the incomparable  a young bachelor of Cordova  decidedly the first genius that ever Spain produced  He will not suffer his works to be printed during his lifetime  but confines himself to a private communication among his friends  What is very remarkable  nature has gifted him with the uncommon talent of succeeding in every department of poetry  His principal excellence is in satire  there he outshines himself  He does not resemble  like Lucilius  a muddy stream with a slimy bottom  but is rather like the Tagus  rolling its transparent waters over a golden sand   You give a fine description of this bachelor  said I to Fabricio  and questionless a character of such merit must have attracted an infinite deal of envy  The whole gang of authors  answered he  good and bad equally  are open mouthed against him  He deals in bombast  says one  aims at double meanings  luxuriates in metaphor and affects transposition  His verses  says another  have all the obscurity of those which the Salian priests used to chaunt in their processions  and which nobody was the wiser for hearing  There are others who impute it to him as a fault  to have exercised his genius at one time in sonnets or ballads  at another in play writing  in heroic stanzas  and in minor efforts of wit alternately  as if he had madly taken upon himself to eclipse the best writers each in their own favourite walk  But all these thrusts of jealousy are successfully parried  where the muse  which is their mark  becomes the idol of the great and of the multitude at once   Under so able a master did I serve my apprenticeship  and  vanity apart  the preceptor was reflected in the disciple  So happily did I catch his spirit  that by this time he would not be ashamed to own some of my detached pieces  After his example  I carry my goods to market at great houses where the bidding is eager  and the sagacity of the bidders not difficult to match  It is true that I have a very insinuating talent at recitation  which places my compositions in no disadvantageous light  In short  I am the dear delight of the nobility  and live in the most particular intimacy with the Duke of Medina Sidonia  just as Horace used to live with his jolly companion Maecenas  By such conjuration and mighty magic have I won the name of author  You see the method lies within a narrow compass  Now  Gil Blas  it is your turn to deliver a round unvarnished tale of your exploits   On this hint I spake  and unlike most narrators  gave all the important particulars  passing lightly over minute and tiresome circumstances  The action of talking  long continued  puts one in mind of dining  His ebony cabinet  which served for larder  pantry  and all possible uses  was ransacked for napkins  bread  a shoulder of mutton far gone in a decline  with its last and best contents  a bottle of excellent wine  so that we sat down to table in high spirits  as friends are wont to do after a long separation  You observe  said he  this free and independent manner of life  I might find a plate laid for me every day  if I chose it  in the very first houses  but  besides that the muse often pays me a visit and detains me within doors  I have a little of Aristippus in my nature  I can pass with equal relish from the great and busy world to my re treat  from all the researches of luxury to the simplicity of my own frugal board   The wine was so good  that we encroached upon a second bottle  As a relish to our fruit and cheese  I begged to be favoured with the sight of something  the offspring of his inspired moments  He immediately rummaged among his papers  and read me a sonnet with much energy of tone  Yet  with all the advantage of accent and expression  there was something
