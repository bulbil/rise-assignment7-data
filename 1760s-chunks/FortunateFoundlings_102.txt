now are in  and ordered   something should be given for our refreshment  but my lady has continued   obstinate to dye  and to that end has refused all subsistence  This  oh   invincible monarch  is the sad history of our misfortunes   misfortunes    which  alas  can never be retrieved  nor admit any consolation but in   the hope of vengeance       Here a torrent of tears closed the sad narration  and the king cried   out  turning as he spoke to us that followed him   It is the cause of   heaven and earth  my friends  said he  to punish these barbarians  and   shew them that there is a God  for sure at present they are ignorant   of it       The generous monarch after this gave orders that these afflicted and   abused woman should be escorted to a place of safety  and for that   purpose halted for the space of two days  then proceeded towards Grodno   with such expedition  that after ages will look upon it as incredible   that so large an army  and also encumbered with a great quantity of   baggage  could have marched in the time they did       But the king of Sweden was on fire to encounter in person the czar of   Muscovy  who  with about 2000 men  was then in that city  so great was   his impatience  that he galloped before his troops  not above 600 of   those best mounted being able to keep pace with him  till he came in   sight of the south gate  which gave him entrance without any opposition    while the czar and his forces made their escape out at the north gate    not doubting but the king of Sweden s whole army were come up with him       He was afterward so much vexed and ashamed to think he had quitted the   town to no more than 600 of the enemy  that  to retrieve a mistake which   he feared might be looked upon as cowardice  being informed the body  of   the army was near five leagues off  he sent a party of 1500 horse in   order to surprize the king and his few guards  The Muscovites entered by   night  but the alarm being given  the fortune which still had waited on   the Swedish armies  immediately put them all to the rout  and the army   soon after arriving  the conqueror lost no time  but pursued those that   remained alive into the forest of Mensky  on the other side of which the   czar had then entrenched himself  and had made the general rendezvous of   the Russian army  which was continually divided into parties  and   sometimes falling on the Swedes in the rear  and sometimes in the flank    very much annoyed them in their march  these brave men had also other   difficulties to encounter with  the forest was so extremely thick  that   the infantry were obliged to fell down trees every moment  during the   whole time of their passage  to make way for the baggage and troops       Their industry and vigour surmounting all these obstacles  they once   more found themselves in an open country  but on the banks of a river    on the opposite side of which were 20 000 Muscovites placed to oppose   their crossing  The king made no delay  but quitting his horse  threw   himself into the river  and was instantly followed by all the foot    while the troops under the command of general Renchild and Hoorn    galloped round thro  the morrass in which that river ended  and both   together charged the enemy  who  after some faint shew of resistance    fled with the utmost precipitation  The whole army being now joined   marched on toward the Boristhenes  but with fatigues which are   impossible to be described  Horatio kept still close to the king  and   whether he fought or marched  was on foot or on horsback  was always in   his fight ready to bear his commands to the generals  or assist him in   the time of danger  More than once had the conqueror been indebted to   this young warrior  for turning the point of the destructive sword from   giving him the same death he was dealing about to others  yet in all the   dangers he had been in never had he received one wound  and this often   made the king say  who was a firm believer in predestination  that   heaven designed him for a soldier  his fortune  his valour  his   activity  added to his obliging and modest behaviour  indeed rendered   him so dear to his royal master  that there were very few  if any  to   whom he gave greater marks of his favour  And had Dorilaus  or even   Charlotta herself  all tender
