 make Hell superfluous     That you do love me  I verily believe  and the fond Hope  that you will ever do so  is all   200 the Hold I have of Happiness  The charming Change  you speak of in your Sentiments  has transported me almost beyond my Senses  To have you love me with Tenderness and Delicacy  all gross Desires for ever banished from your Heart  is Joy unspeakable —Now  and now only  I begin to live  and you to love   How earnestly  how passionately  do I languish to be a Partner in the rational Delight you mention  to have the Essence of Wisdom  Learning  Eloquence  and Truth  from thy harmonious Tongue   till  raised by Gratitude and Rapture  I catch my kind Instructor in my Arms  and teach even him what it is to love  — Oh  Harry  why has not Fortune placed me in a Sphere to indulge my first  my last  my only Wish  of being always and for ever your s  From the Extremity of Joy my Heart is plunged in the severest Grief  when I reflect that a few  a very few Months will divide us  perhaps  for ever  Oh  I can t bear the Thought —You will forget me then  — no more remember that you once did love me  or that I ever did  and ever shall love you —My Heart is torn in Pieces with this Thought —I ll not indulge it   As I am always pleased at your being engaged in any Pursuit  that can be either useful or delightful to you  I am charmed with your Passion for Planting  I think it is Addison  who says    There is something truly magnificent in   201 this kind of Amusement  it gives a noble Air to several Parts of Nature  it fills the Earth with a  Variety of beautiful Scenes  and has something in it like Creation  for this Reason  the Pleasure of one who plants is like that of a Poet  who is more delighted with his own Productions than any other Writer or Artist whatsoever     I hope you ll pardon my Quotation  as it is only meant to prove  that the whole Study of my Life   true as the Needle to the Pole   tends to you only  for I am well assured this Passage would have passed   unmarked by my unheeding Eye   had you not been ingaged in this noble Avocation  — In short  I never take up a Book but with a Design of rendering myself more worthy of your personal or epistolary Converse  I am well convinced  that not all the Authors I can ever read  will prevent my falling short of that ne plus ultra  It is from you  and you alone  my dear Preceptor  I must receive both Inspiration and Expression —    From Lips like your s  what Precepts fail to move   Too soon they taught me  twas no Sin to love   I will with great Pleasure adopt the Name of Heloise  provided you reassume that of Abelard  she who lately had it might have a more intelligent Mind  but not one so well calculated to   202 be your Pupil  as I have  for she wanted both Love and Respect for her Tutor   I have thought every Day increased in Length  since you talked of coming to Town  had I nothing to hope  or fear  it is highly probable  I should have discovered every Day is shorter  than the Day before  but  the nearer we approach to the Summit of our Wishes  the intervening Space grows more tedious  by Recollection of the past Fatigue   Adieu   Frances   LETTER CX   My dear ELOISE  Paraclete   IF I had no other of the many Reasons I have to write to you  this one would be sufficient  that I observe  my Letters have a good Effect upon your Spirits  which gives me greater Pleasure  and Pride  than would the Applause of the World  were I sure of gaining it  by printing them   The Quotation  you sent me on Planting  is indeed from Addison  in one of his Spectators  for who can be in Doubt  upon any Passage wrote by him  What an infinite Difference there is between his Papers  and any of the rest  bound up with them  What a Nobleness of Sentiment  Justness of Thought  Perspicuity of Stile  Elegance of Expression  and Propriety of   203 Language there is in all his Writings  They say  prudent Oeconomists should lay by something always out of their annual Income  to avail themselves of  upon any natural  or accidental Emergency  So I have marked several of Addison s Papers  to be referred to  on any extraordinary Distress  or Misfortune of Life  against Pain  Sickness  old Age  Poverty  the Hour of Death  and the Day of Judgment  In short  meer Man is not able to support his Spirit  under any of these Pressures  and the Writings of several eminent Men are admirable Resources to strengthen Philosophy  for the present  and enliven Hope  for the Future
