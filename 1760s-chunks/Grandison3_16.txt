in Mrs  Lane s neighbourhood  and of her violence to his Emily  not only threatned to take from her that moiety of the annuity which he is at liberty to withdraw  but gave orders that she should never again be allowed to see his ward but in his presence  And she has been quiet till of late  only threatening and demanding  But now she seems  on this her marriage with Major O Hara  to have meditated new schemes  or is aiming  perhaps  at new methods to bring to bear an old one  of which Sir Charles had private intimation given him by one of the persons to whom  in her cups  she once boasted of it  Which was  that as soon as Miss Emily was marriageable  she would endeavour  either by fair means  or foul  to get her into her hands  And if she did  but for one week  she should the next come out the wife of a man she had in view  who would think half the fortune more than sufficient for himself  and make over the other half to her  and then she should come into her right  which she deems to be half of the fortune of which her husband died possessed   This that follows is a copy of the letter left for Emily by this mother  which  tho  not well spelled  might have been written by a better woman  who had hardships to complain of which might have intitled her to pity     11  My dear Emily   IF you have any love  any duty  left  for an unhappy mother whose faults have been barbarously aggravated  to justify the ill usage of a husband who was not faultless  I conjure you to insist upon making me a visit  either at my new lodgings in Dean street Soho  or that you will send me word where I can see you  supposing I am not permitted to see you as this day  or that you should not be at Colnebrooke  where  it seems  you have been some days  I cannot believe that your guardian  for his own reputation sake  as well as for justice sake  as he is supposed to be a good man  will deny you  if you insist upon it  as you ought to do  if you have half the love for me  that I have for you   Can I doubt that you will insist upon it  I cannot  I long to see you  I long to lay you in my bosom  And I have given hopes to Major O Hara  a man of one of the best families in Ireland  and a very worthy man  and a brave man too  who knows how to right an injured wife  if he is put to it  but who wishes to proceed amicably  that you will not scruple  as my husband  to call him father   I hear a very good account of your improvements  Emily  and I am told  that you are grown very tall  and pretty  O my Emily —What a grievous thing is it to say  that I am told these things  and not to have been allowed to see you  and to behold your growth  and those improvements  which must rejoice my heart  and do  tho  I am so basely belied as I have been  Do not you  Emily  despise her that bore you  It is a dreadful thing  with such fortunes as your father left  that I must be made poor and dependent  and then be despised for being so   But if you  my child  are taught to be  and will be  one of those  what  tho  I have such happy prospects in my present marriage  will be my fate but a   4〈1  duplicate〉  11〈1  duplicate〉  40 bitter death  which your want of duty will hasten  For what mother can bear the contempts of her child  And in that case your great fortune will not set you above God s judgments  But better things are hoped of my Emily  by her  Indulgent  tho  heretofore unhappy Mother  HELEN O HARA   Saturday  March 18   My Lord thought fit to open this letter  He is sorry that he did  because the poor girl is so low spirited  that he does not choose to let her see it  but will leave it to her guardian to give it to her  or not  as he pleases   Miss Grandison lifted up her hands and eyes as she read it  Such a wretch as this  said she  to remind Emily of God s judgments  and that line written as even as the rest  How was it possible  if her wicked heart could suggest such words  that her fingers could steadily write them  But indeed she verifies the words of the wise man  There is no wickedness like the wickedness of a woman   We all long to see Sir Charles  Poor Emily  in particular  will be unhappy till he comes   While we expect a favoured person  tho  rich in the company of the friends we are with  what a diminution does it give to enjoyments that would be complete were
