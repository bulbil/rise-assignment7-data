disgrace  This singular  proposition raised the curiosity of Peregrine  who promised to yield all  manner of attention  and desired him to begin without further preamble   The governor  encouraged by this appearance of candour  expressed his  satisfaction in finding him so open to conviction  and told him he would  proceed upon geometrical principles  then  hemming thrice  observed that  no mathematical inquiries could be carried on  except upon certain data   or concessions of truth that were self evident  and therefore he must  have his assent to a few axioms  which he was sure Mr  Pickle would see  no reason to dispute   In the first place  then   said he   you will  grant  I hope  that youth and discretion are with respect to each other  as two parallel lines  which  though infinitely produced  remain still  equidistant  and will never coincide  then you must allow that passion  acts upon the human mind in a ratio compounded of the acuteness of  sense  and constitutional heat  and  thirdly  you will not deny that  the angle of remorse is equal to that of precipitation  These postulata    6 22 15  3 45 PM   being admitted   added he  taking pen  ink  and paper  and drawing a  parallelogram   let youth be represented by the right line  a b  and  discretion by another right line  c d  parallel to the former  Complete  the parallelogram  a b c d  and let the point of intersection  b   represent perdition  Let passion  represented under the letter c  have  a motion in the direction c a  At the same time  let another motion  be communicated to it  in the direction c d  it will proceed in the  diagonal c b  and describe it in the same time that it would have  described the side c a  by the first motion  or the side  c d  by the  second  To understand the demonstration of this corollary  we must  premise this obvious principle  that when a body is acted upon by a  motion of power parallel to a right line given in position  this power   or motion  has no effect to cause the body to approach towards that  line  or recede from it  but to move in a line parallel to a right line  only  as appears from the second law of motion  therefore c a being  parallel to d b     His pupil having listened to him thus far  could contain himself no  longer  but interrupted the investigation with a loud laugh  and  told him that his postulata put him in mind of a certain learned and  ingenious gentleman  who undertook to disprove the existence of natural  evil  and asked no other datum on which to found his demonstration   but an acknowledgment that  everything that is  is right    You may  therefore   said he  in a peremptory tone   spare yourself the trouble  of torturing your invention  for  after all  I am pretty certain that  I shall want capacity to comprehend the discussion of your lemma  and  consequently be obliged to all the pangs of an ingenuous mind that I  refuse my assent to your deduction    Mr  Jolter was disconcerted at this declaration  and so much offended  at Peregrine s disrespect  that he could not help expressing his  displeasure  by telling him flatly  that he was too violent and  headstrong to be reclaimed by reason and gentle means  that he  the  tutor  must be obliged  in the discharge of his duty and conscience  to  inform the commodore of his pupil s imprudence  that if the laws of this  realm were effectual  they would take cognizance of the gipsy who  had led him astray  and observed  by way of contrast  that if such  a preposterous intrigue had happened in France  she would have been  clapped up in a convent two years ago  Our lover s eyes kindled with  indignation  when he heard his mistress treated with such irreverence   he could scarce refrain from inflicting manual chastisement on the  blasphemer  whom he reproached in his wrath as an arrogant pedant   without either delicacy or sense  and cautioned him against rising any  such impertinent freedoms with his affairs for the future on pain of  incurring more severe effects of his resentment   Mr  Jolter  who entertained very high notions of that veneration to  which he thought himself entitled by his character and qualifications   had not borne  without repining  his want of influence and authority  over his pupil  against whom he cherished a particular grudge ever since  the adventure of the painted eye  and therefore  on this occasion  his  politic forbearance had been overcome by the accumulated motives of his  disgust  Indeed  he would have resigned his charge with disdain  had  not he been encouraged to persevere  by the hopes of a good living which  Trunnion had in his gift  or known how to dispose of himself for
