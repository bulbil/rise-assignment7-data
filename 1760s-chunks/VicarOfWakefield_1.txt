THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD  A TALE  Supposed to be written by HIMSELF   Sperate miseri  cavete faelices   VOL  I   SALISBURY  Printed by B  COLLINS  For F  NEWBERY  in Pater Noster Row  London  MDCCLXVI   Page   unnumbered   ADVERTISEMENT   THERE are an hundred faults in this Thing  and an hundred things might be said to prove them beauties  But it is needless  A book may be amusing with numerous errors  or it may be very dull without a single absurdity  The hero of this piece unites in himself the three greatest characters upon earth  he is a priest  an husbandman  and the father of a family  He is drawn as ready to teach  and ready to obey  as simple in affluence  and majestic in adversity  In this age of opulence and refinement whom can such a character please  Such as are fond of high life  will turn with disdain from the simplicity of his country fire side  Such as mistake ribaldry for humour  will find no wit in his harmless conversation  and such  Page   unnumbered   as have been taught to deride religion  will laugh at one whose chief stores of comfort are drawn from futurity   OLIVER GOLDSMITH   Page   unnumbered   CHAP  I   The description of the family of Wakefield  in which a kindred likeness prevails as well of minds as of persons    I WAS ever of opinion  that the honest man who married and brought up a large family  did more service than he who continued single  and only talked of population  From this motive  I had scarce taken orders a year before I began to think seriously of matrimony  chose my wife as she did her wedding gown  not for a fine glossy surface  but such qualities as would wear well  To do her justice  she was a good natured notable woman  and as for breeding  there were few country ladies who at that time could shew more  She could read any English book without much spelling  and for pickling  preserving  and cookery   Page  2  none could excel her  She prided herself much also upon being an excellent contriver in house keeping  yet I could never find that we grew richer with all her contrivances   However  we loved each other tenderly  and our fondness encreased with age  There was in fact nothing that could make us angry with the world or each other  We had an elegant house  situated in a fine country  and a good neighbourhood  The year was spent in moral or rural amusements  in visiting our rich neighbours  or relieving such as were poor  We had no revolutions to fear  nor fatigues to undergo  all our adventures were by the fire side  and all our migrations from the blue bed to the brown   As we lived near the road  we often had the traveller or stranger come to taste our gooseberry wine  for which we had great reputation  and I profess with the veracity of an historian  that I never knew one of them find fault with it  Our cousins  Page  3  too  even to the fortieth remove  all remembered their affinity  without any help from the Herald s office  and came very frequently to see us  Some of them did us no great honour by these claims of kindred  for literally speaking  we had the blind  the maimed  and the halt amongst the number  However  my wife always insisted that as they were the same flesh and blood with us  they should sit with us at the same table  So that if we had not very rich  we generally had very happy friends about us  for this remark will hold good thro  life  that the poorer the guest  the better pleased he ever is with being treated  and as some men gaze with admiration at the colours of a tulip  and others are smitten with the wing of a butterfly  so I was by nature an admirer of happy human faces  However  when any one of our relations was found to be a person of very bad character  a troublesome guest  or one we desired to get rid of  upon his leaving my house for the first time  I ever took care to lend him a riding coat  or a pair of  Page  4  boots  or sometimes an horse of small value  and I always had the satisfaction of finding he never came back to return them  By this the house was cleared of such as we did not like  but never was the family of Wakefield known to turn the traveller or the poor dependant out of doors   Thus we lived several years in a state of much happiness  not but that we sometimes had those little rubs which Providence sends to enhance the value of its other favours  My orchard was often robbed by school boys  and my wife s custards plundered by the cats or the children  The  Squire would sometimes fall asleep in the most pathetic parts of my sermon  or his lady return my wife s civilities at church with a mutilated curtesy  But we soon got over the uneasiness caused by such accidents  and
