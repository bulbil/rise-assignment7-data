less uncouth appearance  but then he was a wit  and though of a very  peculiar genius  partook largely of that disposition which is common to  all wits  who never enjoy themselves except when their talents meet with  those marks of distinction and veneration  which  in their own opinion   they deserve   These circumstances being premised  it is not to be wondered at  if this  triumvirate made no objections to the proposal  when some of the graver  personages of the company made a motion for adjourning into another  apartment  where they might enjoy their pipes and bottles  while  the young folks indulged themselves in the continuance of their  own favourite diversion  Thus rescued  as it were  from a state of  annihilation  the first use the two lads of the castle made of their  existence  was to ply the bridegroom so hard with bumpers  that in less  than an hour he made divers efforts to sing  and soon after was carried  to bed  deprived of all manner of sensation  to the utter disappointment  of the bridemen and maids  who  by this accident  were prevented from  throwing the stocking  and performing certain other ceremonies practised  on such occasions  As for the bride  she bore this misfortune with  great good humour  and indeed  on all occasions  behaved like a discreet  woman  perfectly well acquainted with the nature of her own situation   CHAPTER V    Mrs  Pickle assumes the Reins of Government in her own Family  Her    6 22 15  3 45 PM   Sister in law undertakes an Enterprise of great Moment  but is for some  time diverted from her Purpose by a very interesting Consideration   Whatever deference  not to say submission  she had paid to Mrs  Grizzle  before she nearly allied to her family  she no sooner became Mrs   Pickle  than she thought it encumbent on her to act up to the dignity of  the character  and  the very day after the marriage  ventured to dispute  with her sister in law on the subject of her own pedigree  which she  affirmed to be more honourable in all respects than that of her husband   observing that several younger brothers of her house had arrived at  the station of lord mayor of London  which was the highest pitch of  greatness that any of Mr  Pickle s predecessors had ever attained   This presumption was like a thunderbolt to Mrs  Grizzle  who began to  perceive that she had not succeeded quite so well as she imagined  in  selecting for her brother a gentle and obedient yoke fellow  who would  always treat her with that profound respect which she thought due to her  superior genius  and be entirely regulated by her advice and direction   however  she still continued to manage the reins of government in the  house  reprehending the servants as usual  an office she performed with  great capacity  and in which she seemed to take singular delight  until  Mrs  Pickle  on pretence of consulting her ease  told her one day  she would take that trouble on herself  and for the future assume the  management of her own family  Nothing could be more mortifying to Mrs   Grizzle than such a declaration  to which  after a considerable pause   and strange distortion of look  she replied   I shall never refuse  or repine at any trouble that may conduce to my brother s  advantage     Dear madam   answered the sister   I am infinitely obliged  for your kind concern for Mr  Pickle s interest  which I consider as my  own  but I cannot bear to see you a sufferer by your friendship  and   therefore  insist on exempting you from the fatigue you have borne so  long    In vain did the other protest that she took pleasure in the task   Mrs  Pickle ascribed the assurance to her excess of complaisance  and  expressed such tenderness of zeal for her dear sister s health and  tranquility  that the reluctant maiden found herself obliged to resign  her authority  without enjoying the least pretext for complaining of her  being deposed   This disgrace was attended by a fit of peevish devotion that lasted  three or four weeks  during which period she had the additional chagrin  of seeing the young lady gain an absolute ascendency over the mind of  her brother  who was persuaded to set up a gay equipage  and improve  his housekeeping  by an augmentation in his expense  to the amount of  a thousand a year at least  though his alteration in the economy of his  household effected no change in his own disposition  or manner of life   for as soon as the painful ceremony of receiving and returning visits  was performed  he had recourse to the company of his sea friends  with  whom he spent the best part of his time  But if he was satisfied with  his condition  the case was otherwise with Mrs  Grizzle  who  finding  her importance in the family greatly diminished  her attractions  neglected by all the
