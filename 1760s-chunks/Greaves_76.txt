 and I shall consider it as an additional obligation  if Mr  Elmy will likewise superintend this retribution    At the close of this address  the whole yard and gateway rung with acclamation  while honest Crowe  whose generosity was not inferior even to that of the accomplished Greaves  pulled out his purse  and declared  that  as he had begun the engagement  he would at least go share and share alike in new caulking their seams  and repairing their timbers  The knight  rather than enter into a dispute with his novice  told him he considered the twenty guineas as given by them both in conjunction  and that they would confer together on that subject hereafter   This point being adjusted  Mr  Elmy assumed all the solemnity of the magistrate  and addressed himself to Prickle in these words   Farmer Prickle  I am both sorry and ashamed to see a man of your years and circumstances so little respected  that you cannot find sufficient bail for forty pounds  a sure testimony that you have neither cultivated the friendship  nor deserved the goodwill of your neighbours  I have heard of your quarrels and your riots  your insolence and litigious disposition  and often wished for an opportunity of giving you a proper taste of the law s correction  That opportunity now offers  you have  in the hearing of all these people  poured forth a torrent of abuse against me  both in the character of a gentleman and of a magistrate  Your abusing me personally perhaps I should have overlooked with the contempt it deserves  but I should ill vindicate the dignity of my office as a magistrate  by suffering you to insult the bench with impunity  I shall therefore imprison you for contempt  and you shall remain in jail until you can find bail on the other prosecutions    Prickle  the first transports of his anger having subsided  began to be pricked with the thorns of compunction  he was indeed extremely mortified at the prospect of being sent to jail so disgracefully  His countenance fell  and  after a hard internal struggle  while the clerk was employed in writing the mittimus  he said he hoped his worship would not send him to prison  He begged pardon of him  and our adventurers  for having abused them in his passion  and observed  that  as he had received a broken head  and paid two and twenty guineas for his folly  he could not be said to have escaped altogether without punishment  even if the plaintiff should agree to exchange releases   Sir Launcelot  seeing this stubborn rustic effectually humbled  became an advocate in his favour with Mr  Elmy  and Tom Clarke  who forgave him at his request  and a mutual release being executed  the farmer was permitted to depart  The populace were regaled at our adventurer s expense  and the men  women  and children  who had been wounded or bruised in the battle  to the number of ten or a dozen  were desired to wait upon Mr  Elmy in the morning  to receive the knight s bounty  The justice was prevailed upon to spend the evening with Sir Launcelot and his two companions  for whom supper was bespoke  but the first thing the cook prepared was a poultice for Crowe s head  which was now enlarged to a monstrous exhibition  Our knight  who was all kindness and complacency  shook Mr  Clarke by the hand  expressing his satisfaction at meeting with his old friends again  and told him softly  that he had compliments for him from Mrs  Dolly Cowslip  who now lived with his Aurelia   Clarke was confounded at this intelligence  and  after some hesitation   Lord bless my soul   cried he   I ll be shot  then  if the pretended Miss Meadows wa n t the same as Miss Darnel   He then declared himself extremely glad that poor Dolly had got into such an agreeable situation  passed many warm encomiums on her goodness of heart and virtuous inclinations  and concluded with appealing to the knight  whether she did not look very pretty in her green joseph  In the meantime  he procured a plaster for his own head  and helped to apply the poultice to that of his uncle  who was sent to bed betimes with a moderate dose of sack whey  to promote perspiration  The other three passed the evening to their mutual satisfaction  and the justice  in particular  grew enamoured of the knight s character  dashed as it was with extravagance   Let us now leave them to the enjoyment of a sober and rational conversation  and give some account of other guests  who arrived late in the evening  and here fixed their night quarters  But as we have already trespassed on the reader s patience  we shall give him a short respite  until the next chapter makes its appearance             CHAPTER EIGHTEEN  IN WHICH THE RAYS OF CHIVALRY SHINE WITH RENOVATED LUSTRE   Our hero little dreamed that he had a formidable rival in the person of the knight  who arrived about eleven  at the sign of the St  George  and  by the noise he made  gave intimation of his importance  This was no other than
