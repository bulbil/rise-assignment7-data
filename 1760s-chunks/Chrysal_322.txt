poor language look like embroidery   on a blanket   they only make its poverty ridiculous  Beside   your stalking in their stilts betrays you into many a stumble in the   dirt  Your figures frequently fly in the face of common sense    and break through every rule of grammar          Well  sir  I shall consider of these particulars  The great   objection I have heard made to modern plays is their want of   business   but this can never be charged to mine  There is a ghost   and a battle  and a king dethroned  Business enough  and enough    I am sure         Ghosts and battles  sir  it is true  are sometimes introduced   â  with success   but then it must be a master in the art  else they   have a contrary effect          I apprehend that the aim of tragedy is to work upon the passions    In this  I believe  you cannot say I have failed   the distress is truly   great          Distress  when out of character  loses the appearance of reality    and becomes ridiculous  A king in an almshouse  and a queen   begging from door to door  are images which sink into a burlesque          It is very well  sir   you may say what you please  but I am   satisfied it is not want of merit in my play that makes you refuse   it  You daily act much worse  If it had been recommended to   you by some lord  you would have found none of these faults     but merit may starve without interest to support it nowadays    This ia fine encouragement to genius  truly  and the public is like   to be well entertained while such men have it in their power to   refuse everything that does not happen to please themselves            382 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     Saying this  he snatched up his play  leaving my master to please   himself with the prospect of being criticised upon La a newspaper    and pulled to pieces in a scurrilous pamphlet  He had not time to   indulge these reflections long  when another of his clients attended   his levee  As soon as he was seated â€”   I have read over your work   with great care    said my master    and am sorry to say I think it   improper for the stage          Pray  sir  why so     answered the poet with an air of importance        It is written strictly according to the rules of the drama  and   enriched with the sublimest sentiments of the ancients          Sir  I am sensible of its merits as well as of the great learning   of the author  but the taste of the times requires entertainment of   a difierent kind          Surely compliance with a vitiated taste will not justify the   breach of rules  taken originally from nature  and established for   so many ages          I neither dispute the original justice  nor the antiquity of them     but I apprehend that the latter  in a great measure  destroys the   present force of the former  The customs of mankind â€” the part of   nature which comes within the province of the drama â€” are so   changed since the establishment of those rules  that it would be   most absurd to exact obedience to them now  Besides  may it   not be said  without violation to the respect due to antiquity    that experience  in a great length of time  may have made many   improvements in those rules  The infancy of every art is   weak          But whatever changes may have happened in the customs of the   world  truth still remains the same  and the genuine sentiments of   nature cannot displease          Very true  But still they may not always be received with   equal pleasure in the same garb  Unimpassioned sentiment  how    ever just and sublime  works not the effects designed by the drama    whose aim is to convey instruction and pleasure at the same time    by an immediate address to the passions          Is it possible that you can be an advocate for the irregular   monsters which at present dishonour the stage           As for irregularity  I look upon it to be but an imaginary defect    though  even if it were otherwise
