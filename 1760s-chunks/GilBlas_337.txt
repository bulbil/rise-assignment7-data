country  is in the king s gift  We repaired immediately to Madrid on receiving the intelligence  as the doctor wished to thank his patronesses before he took possession of his benefice  I had more than one opportunity of seeing Catalina  and conversing with her  The cheerful turn of my temper and a certain easy air of good company were altogether to her taste  for my part  I found her so much to my liking  that I could not help saying yes to the little advances of partiality which she made in my favour  in short  we got to feel very kindly towards each other  You must not write a comment with your nails  my dear Beatrice  on this episode in the romance of my amours  because I was firmly persuaded of your inconstancy  and you will allow that heresy  though impious  being also blind  my penance may reasonably be remitted on sincere conversion   In the mean time Doctor Ignacio was making ready to set out for Grenada  His relation and myself  out of our wits at the impending separation  had recourse to an expedient which rescued us from its horrors  I shammed illness  complained of my head  complained of my chest  and made a characteristic wry face for every pain and ache in the catalogue of human infirmities  My master called in a physician  who told me with a grave face  after putting his questions in the usual course  that my complaint was of a much more serious nature than might appear to unprofessional observation  and that  according to all present likelihood  I should keep my chamber a long time  The doctor  impatient to take possession of his preferment  did not think it quite so well to delay his departure  but chose rather to hire another boy  he therefore contented himself with handing me over to the care of a nurse  with whom he left a sum of money to bury me if I should die  or to remunerate me for my services if I should recover  As soon as I knew Don Ignacio to be safe on the road for Grenada  I was cured of all my maladies  I got up  made my final bow to the physician who had evinced so thorough a knowledge of my ease  and fairly turned my nurse out of doors  who made her retreat good with baggage and ammunition  to the amount of more than half the sum for which she ought to have accounted with me  While I was enacting the sick man  Catalina was playing another part about the person of her mistress  Donna Anna de Gu√©vra  into whose conception having by dint of many a wordy process inserted the notion  that I was the man of all others ready cut and dry for an intrigue  she induced her to choose me for one of her agents  The royal and most catholic nurse  whose genius for great undertakings was either produced or exasperated by the love of great possessions  having occasion for suitable ministers  received me among her hangers on  and lost no opportunity of ascertaining how far I was for her purpose  She confided some commissions to my ear  which  vanity apart  called for no little address  and what they called for was ready at hand  accordingly  she gave me all possible credit for the diligent execution of my office  while my discontent swelled high against her for fobbing me off with the cold recompense of approbation  The good lady was so abominably avaricious  as not to give me a working partner s share in the profits of my industry  nor to allow for the wear and tear of my conscience  She seemed inclined to consider  that by paying me my wages  all the requisitions of Christian charity were made good between us  This excess of illiberal economy would soon have parted us  had it not been for the fascination of Catalina s gentle virtues  who became more desperately in love with me from day to day  and completed the paroxysm by a formal proposal of marriage   Fair and softly  my pretty friend  said I  we must look before we leap into that bottomless gulf  the first point to be settled is to ascertain the death of a young woman  who obtained the refusal before you  and made me supremely happy  for no other purpose but to anticipate the purgatory of an intermediate state in the present  All a mere sham  a put off  answered Catalina  you swear you are married only by way of throwing a genteel veil over your abhorrence of my person and manners  In vain did I call all the powers to witness  that what I said was solemnly true  my sincere avowal was considered as a mere copy of my countenance  the lady was grievously offended  and changed her whole behaviour in regard to me  There was no downright quarrel  but our tender intercourse became visibly more rigid and unaccommodating  so that nothing further took place between us but cold formality and common place attentions   Just at the nick of time  I heard that Signor Gil Blas de Santillane  secretary to the prime minister of the Spanish monarchy  wanted a servant  and the situation was the more flattering  as it bore the bell among all the vacancies of the court register office  Signor de Santillane  they told
