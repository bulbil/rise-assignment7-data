 at least  because this Hypothesis accounts for all the Phaenomena of the celestial Bodies  which would otherwise appear a Heap of wild Incoherence  And rashly to deny a Thing  because we cannot comprehend it  is such a Pyrrhonism  as to affirm we cannot see  because we are not sufficiently informed how we see  For to say we see by our Eyes  is unphilosophical  for our Eyes are but the Organs of Sight  that is  the Instrument  not the Cause  In looking up through the Chain of Effects  our Reason hesitates at a certain Period  which we presume to be the first Cause  though  beyond our Comprehension  the Links may be infinite  before they reach the first Cause  and  then  to say we cannot comprehend Page  168 that first Cause  is but a Sort of Definition of it  for  if we could comprehend it  it could not be what we must suppose it   Ever since you attacked me so well upon my Hint  that  perhaps  there was as little Analogy  as Comparison  between the Virtues of Man  and the Attributes of God  I have been revolving that Subject in my Mind  for we should have Reasons  even for our Doubts  in so high a Matter  and  the more I consider it  the more am I confirmed in an Opinion  which was but a Surmise  at first  If we stick to the Religion of Nature  we can  indeed  only say  perhaps there may be no Relation between them  but when we come down to Revelation  we shall find many express Authorities to support my Argument  two of which I think sufficient to produce  What Notions of Justice can the human Mind supply us with  for the Curse derived to all Mankind from original Sin  Then  again  Part of the second Cammandment says    I will visit the Sins of the Fathers upon the Children  to the third and fourth Generation of them that hate me    c  What human Equity is there in this  Is not the Crime of hating God  in the proper Sense of that Expression  sufficient to incur the Punishments denounced against the Wicked  without involving us in our Parent s Guilt  Perhaps it was from such Instances as these in Scripture  that the Page  169 Papists have deduced their absurd Doctrine of Supererogation  for  if we are to be damned by another s Sin  it may be reasonably implied  that we may be saved by another s Merits  Upon the whole  I shall conclude with another Passage from the Scriptures   that the Wisdom of Man is but Foolishness  in the Sight of God   Away  then  with all presumptuous Reasonings of this Kind  but let us submit our Minds to Faith  and begirt ourselves to good Works     Adieu  my Heart s Delight  my Soul s Desire  Say you are well  in your next Letter  and then say you have obliged me   Henry   LETTER CCXXXVII   My Dear FANNY   I RECEIVED no Letter from you last Post  and cannot know whether I shall hear from you by this   till I return To morrow to —  It was unkind in you to neglect writing  when you knew how uneasy I must be to have some Account of your Health  I saw Kitty Yesterday  who heard from some of her Friends  and  by not mentioning you  I hope this Omission was not owing to your Disorder   Page  170I had a wild Night of it  coming here  and have not been so wet  since I was last in the River  I had no Cloaths with me  but what I had on my Back  so I have betaken myself to my Bed  from whence I am now writing to you  and drinking your Health  and my own too  in Milk Whey  My kind Landlady  who is also my Tenant  upon Notice of my coming here To day  has washed my Sheets in the Morning  and my Room in the Evening  to make me welcome   I observed an extraordinary Phaenomenon  as I came along  The Night was extremely dark  and the Rain fell excessively  Notwithstanding which  the whole Mountain  I rode over  seemed to be on Fire  with such an ember Light  as is seen after the Blaze of a Bonfire is gone out  I asked my Guide the Meaning of it   whom I hired at the Foot of the Hill   and he told me  that all the heathy Grounds hereabouts have this Appearance  by Night  This is certainly a very great natural Curiosity  but what I never observed  or heard of before  If this were real Fire  it might put this Part of the Country into a terrible Combustion  as the Collieries happen to meet in the Center of these Hills   This Thought led me insensibly on to the Consideration of the general Conflagration  which is prophesied in Scripture  and which Page  171 our Faith makes us expect  at a certain Period  from some extraordinary Act of divine Power  but which I never heard accounted for  from the Philosophy of Nature  as
