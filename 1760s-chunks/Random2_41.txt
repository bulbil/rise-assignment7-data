and that very morning  while I was at breakfast  introduced his innamorata to my acquaintance —She was a short thick woman  about the age of thirty six  and had a particular prominence of belly  which I perceived at first sight  not without some suspicion of foul play —I desired her  however  to sit  and treated her with a dish of tea  the discourse turning on the good qualities of Strap  whom I represented as a prodigy of sobriety  industry and virtue —When she took her leave  he followed her to the door  and returned licking his lips  and asking if I did not think she was a luscious creature —I made no mystery of my apprehension  but declared my sentiments of her without reserve  at which he was not surprized  telling me  he had observed the same symptom  but was informed by his   116 friend that she was only livergrown  and would in a few months be as small in the Waist as ever —   Yes   said I  a few weeks  I believe  will do the business —In short  Strap  it is my opinion  that you are egregiously imposed upon  and that this friend is no other than a rascal who wants to palm his trull upon you for a wife  that he may at once deliver himself from the importunities of the mother  and the expence of her bantling  for which reason I would not have you trust implicitly to the report he makes of her wealth  which is inconsistent with his behaviour  nor run your head precipitately into a noose  that you may afterwards wished exchanged for the hangman s    He seemed very much startled at my insinuation  and promised to look twice before he leaped  saying  with some heat    Odd  if I find his intention is to betray me  we shall see which of us is the better man  —  My prediction was verified in less than a fortnight  her great belly producing an infant  to the unspeakable amazement of Strap  who was  before this happened  inclinable to believe I had refined a little too much in my penetration  His false friend disappeared  and in a few days after  an execution was issued against her goods and houshold furniture  which were seized by the creditors     Mean while I met my friend Banter at the ordinary  and in the evening went to the opera with him and Mr  Chatter  who pointed out Melinda in one of the boxes  and offered to introduce me to her  observing at the same time  that she was a reigning toast worth ten thousand pounds —This piece of information made my heart bound with joy  and I discovered great   117 eagerness to accept the proposal  upon which he assured me I should dance with her at the next assembly  if he had any influence in that quarter  so saying  he went round  spoke to her some minutes  and  as I imagined  pointed at me  then returning  told me  to my inexpressible pleasure  that I might depend upon what he had promised  for she was now engaged as my partner —Banter  in a whisper  gave me to understand that she was an incorrigible coquette  who would grant the same favour to any young fellow in England  of a tolerable appearance  meerly to engage him among the herd of her admirers  that she might have the pleasure of seeing them increase daily —that she was of a cold insensible disposition  dead to every passion but vanity  and so blind to merit  that he would lay any wager  the wealthiest fool should carry her at last  I attributed a good deal of this intelligence to the satirical turn of my friend  or resentment  for having himself suffered a rebuff from the lady in question  and at any rate  trusted so much to my own accomplishments  as to believe no woman could resist the ardour of my addresses   Full of this confidence  I repaired to Hampstead  in company with Billy Chatter  my Lord Hobble  and doctor Wagtail —Here I saw a very brilliant assembly  before whom I had the honour to walk a minuet with Melinda  who charmed me with her frank manner of receiving me  and easiness of behaviour —Before the country dances began  I received a message by a person I did not know  from Bragwell  who was present  importing that no body who knew him  presumed to dance with Melinda  while he was there in person  and that I would   118 do well to relinquish her without noise  because he had a mind to lead up a country dance with her  This extraordinary intimation  which was delivered in the lady s hearing  did not at all discompose me  who by this time was pretty well acquainted with the character of my rival  I therefore  without the least symptom of concern  bid the gentleman tell Mr  Bragwell  that while I was so happy as to obtain the lady s consent  I should not be sollicitous about his  and desired the bearer himself to bring me no such impertinent messages for the future  Melinda affected a sort of confusion  and pretended to wonder that Mr  Bragwell should give himself such liberties with
