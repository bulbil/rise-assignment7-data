the Popish faction  which still wanted to make new disturbances  The throne of Elizabeth was not yet perfectly fixed  and the intrigues of religion could still overturn it  she therefore was not remiss in sending an army into Scotland  and forcing the French troops out of that kingdom  by a treaty signed to that effect  Soon after the King of France died  and Elizabeth forced her rival to renounce the title of Queen of England  which she had assumed  She went yet still farther  she encouraged the parliament of Scotland to introduce the reformation into that country  her intrigues succeeded  and she thus gained over a stedfast friend in the Scots  from whom the English had  till then  only received repeated acts of enmity and ill will     279 This tempest was scarce allayed  when Philip of Spain gave new alarms  As long as he had fears from the power of the Queen of Scots  by her union with France  he was still attached to Elizabeth  but  when  by the death of the King of France her husband  she was again reduced to her primitive weakness  his jealousy then began to fall upon Elizabeth  With this view he encouraged the insurrections and discontents in Ireland  and Elizabeth with equal care suppressed them  He supported  in France  a league made to exclude the royal family from the throne  Elizabeth protected the opposite side  He oppressed the people of Holland with cruelty and injustice  Elizabeth supported them from sinking under his power  Thus  on every side  she guarded off the dangers that threatened her  and soon after  in her turn  prepared to act offensively against her enemies   But the cares of war did not repress her assiduity in the administration of justice at home  she was resolved to shew the Roman Catholic party an example of moderation  which they might admire but could not imitate  The Monks  who were dispossessed of their monasteries  had been assigned pensions  which were to be paid by the possessors of the forfeited lands  These payments were entirely neglected  and these unhappy men  who had been educated in solitude and ignorance  were now starving in old age  too much disregarded by the Protestants  and too numerous to find relief from those of their own persuasion  Elizabeth ordered that their pensions should be paid with punctuality and justice  and satisfaction made for all arrears unjustly detained     280 In order the more to ingratiate herself with the people  she visited Cambridge and Oxford  and made each a Latin speech  and shewed  by her discourse and conduct  a regard for those seminaries of learning  which had been suppressed by her father   She not only affected this obliging carriage to her inferiors  but also behaved in something of a romantic strain to the courtiers next her person  The gallantries of the court were conducted according to the rules of chivalry  every damsel had her knight  Dudley  who was now become Earl of Leicester  was generally the Queen s  but all writers agree  that her passion for him never proceeded beyond the bounds of Platonic affection  When her commons  in a dutiful manner  represented to her how much the safety of the kingdom depended upon her marrying  she thanked them in an obliging manner  and assured them she was now become the wife of her people  and would be pleased at having it inscribed on her tomb  that having reigned with equity  she lived and died a virgin   I am   c   LETTER XXXV   THE ancient ferocity of the English was not yet quite reclaimed  the barbarous method of fixing the Monarch upon the throne  by executions performed upon the scaffold  was not quite done away  the only difference seemed to be  that formerly those who were obnoxious to the crown  fell without any legal trial  but now they fell with all the forms  yet all the severity of justice     281 While Elizabeth was thus attempting to settle religion  to establish the power  and humble the enemies of her country  she at the same time was guilty of some instances of cruelty  which  tho  coloured with the pretext of law  could only be the effect of the yet uncivilized disposition of the times  The Catholics held meetings to restore their religion by open force  the Countess of Lenox  Arthur Poole  and others  began to form factions in the kingdom  their plottings  however  were discovered  and  upon their own confession  they were condemned  but the Queen  in consideration of their illustrious descent  forgave their offence  A sister of the late Jane Grey  however  though less guilty  met with less clemency  she had married the Earl of Pembroke  without leave from the court  this was considered as an high offence  and the Earl and she were committed to the Tower  After a long imprisonment he was obliged to forsake her  and she  loaded with the misfortune  died in confinement   But this only prepared the way for a cruelty of a more heinous nature  which gave the world a disagreeable remembrance of the transactions committed in the reign of her father  Mary  Queen of Scots  had long renounced her title to the crown of
