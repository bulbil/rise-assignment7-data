if this goodness hold  God   grant it may  for your own soul s sake as well as mine  And oh  how   happy should I be  if          He stopt me  and said  But  my dear girl  what must we do about the   world  and the world s censure  Indeed  I cannot marry       Now was I again struck all of a heap  However  soon recollecting myself    Sir  said I  I have not the presumption to hope such an honour  If I may   be permitted to return in peace and safety to my poor parents  to pray   for you there  it is all I at present request  This  sir  after all my   apprehensions and dangers  will be a great pleasure to me  And  if I   know my own poor heart  I shall wish you happy in a lady of suitable   degree  and rejoice most sincerely in every circumstance that shall make   for the happiness of my late good lady s most beloved son       Well  said he  this conversation  Pamela  is gone farther than I   intended it  You need not be afraid  at this rate  of trusting yourself   with me  but it is I that ought to be doubtful of myself  when I am with   you   But before I say any thing farther on this subject  I will take   my proud heart to task  and  till then  let every thing be as if this   conversation had never passed  Only  let me tell you  that the more   confidence you place in me  the more you ll oblige me  but your doubts   will only beget cause of doubts  And with this ambiguous saying  he   saluted me with a more formal manner  if I may so say  than before  and   lent me his hand  and so we walked toward the house  side by side  he   seeming very thoughtful and pensive  as if he had already repented him   of his goodness       What shall I do  what steps take  if all this be designing  O the   perplexities of these cruel doubtings   To be sure  if he be false  as   I may call it  I have gone too far  much too far   I am ready  on the   apprehension of this  to bite my forward tongue  or rather to beat my   more forward heart  that dictated to that poor machine  for what I have   said  But sure  at least  he must be sincere for the time   He could not   be such a practised dissembler   If he could  O how desperately wicked   is the heart of man   And where could he learn all these barbarous   arts   If so  it must be native surely to the sex   But  silent be my   rash censurings  be hushed  ye stormy tumults of my disturbed mind  for   have I not a father who is a man   A man who knows no guile  who would   do no wrong   who would not deceive or oppress  to gain a kingdom   How   then can I think it is native to the sex  And I must also hope my good   lady s son cannot be the worst of men   If he is  hard the lot of the   excellent woman that bore him   But much harder the hap of your poor   Pamela  who has fallen into such hands   But yet I will trust in God    and hope the best  and so lay down my tired pen for this time          Thursday morning       Somebody rapped at our chamber door this morning  soon after it was   light  Mrs  Jewkes asked  who it was  My master said  Open the door    Mrs  Jewkes  O  said I  for God s sake  Mrs  Jewkes  don t  Indeed  said   she  but I must  Then  said I  and clung about her  let me slip on my   clothes first  But he rapped again  and she broke from me  and I was   frightened out of my wits  and folded myself in the bed clothes  He   entered  and said  What  Pamela  so fearful  after what passed yesterday   between us  O  sir  sir  said I  I fear my prayers have wanted their   wished effect  Pray  good sir  consider  He sat down on the bed side    and interrupted me  No need of your foolish fears  I shall say but a   word or two  and go away       After you went up
