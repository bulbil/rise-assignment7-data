the fleet which caused his fears was found to be   English  the moment he was informed of which he recovered from   iiis sicluiess  and  putting the best face he could upon the matter    went to wait upon the admiral      Though the fleet which the admiral commanded was irresistibly   superior to any that could possibly be opposed to it  he was so   desirous of every addition of strength that he received my master   with evident pleasure  and never inquiring what had been the   cause of his quitting his station  informed him whither they were     stem  post was loose  he returned to Spithead  In the court martial   that followed  he was admonished  but the carpenter was dismissed   the service  Public opinion held that Powlett was responsible for   the carpenter s report  and he was known henceforth as   Captain   Stempost        The expedition against Havana  The fleet  under Pocock  was   carrying 10 000 men under the command of the Earl of Albemarle    Setting sail in March  it passed through the Bahama channel in June   1762          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 295     going  and congratulated him on tlie opportunity lie  would have of   making his fortune  But this opportunity  promising as it might   appear  had no temptations for my master  whose thoughts were   turned another way  However  to carry off the chagrin which he   could not conceal  he expressed his concern in the strongest terms   at not being able to bear a part in so glorious an enterprise  and   produced the report of the condition of his ship  by which she was   represented to be incapable of service  the reason  he alleged  for   his having quitted his proper station  This instantly changed the   whole scene  The adroiral  assuming all the consequence of his   unbounded authority  answered  with a supercilious look  that he   would order the ship to be surveyed by the proper officers  and then   turned away  without deigning to take any further notice of him    As this was no more than my master had expected  his knowledge   of the world  which brought him into the scrape  soon suggested   the proper means for preventing any disagreeable consequences   from it  Accordingly  when the survey was regularly made next   morning  he was honourably acquitted   but the master of the ship   was broke for his error  and the other officers severely rebuked for   not having examined his report before they signed it      In the course of these transactions  I changed my service for that   of the admiral s secretary  who directly gave me to the admiral in   some dealings between them      When I entered into the possession of my new master   he was   lolling in a listless manner on a sofa in his state room  where every   art was exerted to counteract nature  and elude the mid day heat    in one of the fiercest climates of the torrid zone  A gown of thinnest   silk hung loosely over his large limbs   the radiance of the sun was   softened by shades of linen drawn before the open windows  and   kept constantly wet  to cool the air as it entered through them    and every disagreeable savour was drowned in the most delicate   perfumes  The contrast between such magnificent luxury  and   the condition of those whose numbers made his strength  showed   in the most glaring light the infatuation of vanity  in displaying   such temptations to its ovni destruction  as the most implicit obedi    ence to the laws could hardly be supposed proof to  The awkward    ness with which my master bore his state showing that it was not   natural to him  I looked back to his past life  to see by what illus    trious actions he had risen to such an exalted station  but  to my   surprise  discovered that the foundation of his fortune had been no   more than a phlegmatic indolence and servility of soul  which in    duced his superiors to entrust power in his hands  without appre    hension of its raising him to a consequence that might clash with   their designs on any future occasion      I see you are astonished that a person of such a turn should ever   engage in active scenes  or be entrusted with the conduct of an     1 Admiral Sir George Pooook  1706 92   He iserved in the Navy from   1718 1766  and was present in many engagements  He never showed   initiative  but acting strictly according to the   Fighting Instructions      was out manoBuvred by the French in several actions  the results of which
