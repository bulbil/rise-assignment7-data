   Dear sister            Mr  Cardiack  the apothecary  assures me that your husband is in        fact ill  and in extreme danger  he is very pressing to see you  I        will not pretend to advise you what to do on this occasion  you        are the best judge  I shall only say that  if you think fit to        comply with his request  you must be speedy  for  it seems  it is        the opinion of the gentlemen of the faculty  that he is very near        his end  I am  dear sister  yours affectionately            T  THOUGHTLESS        Not all the indifference she had for the person of Mr  Munden  not all   the resentment his moroseness and ill nature had excited in her  could   hinder her from feeling an extreme shock on hearing his life was in   danger  she sought for no excuses  either to evade or delay what he   desired of her  she went directly to him  equally inclined to do so by   her compassion  as she thought herself obliged to it by her duty       As she entered the chamber  she met the apothecary coming out  in asking   him some questions  though she spoke very low  Mr  Munden thought he   distinguished her voice  and cried out  as loud as he was able   Is my   wife here   On which  approaching the bed  and gently opening one of the   curtains   Yes  Mr  Munden   replied she   I am come to offer all the   assistance in my power  and am sorry to find you are in any need of   it     This is very kind   said he  and stretched out one of his hands   towards her  which she took between hers with a great deal of   tenderness   I have been much to blame   resumed he   I have greatly   wronged you  but forgive me  if I live  I will endeavour to deserve it         I hope   said she   Heaven will restore your health  and that we may   live together in a manner becoming persons united as we are     Then you   will not leave me   cried he   Never   answered she   till your   behaviour shall convince me you do not desire my stay        Here he began to make solemn protestations of future amendment  but his   voice failing him  through extreme weakness  a deep sigh  and tender   pressure of his cheek to hers  as she leaned her head upon the pillow    gave her to understand what more he would have said  on this she assured   him she was ready to believe every thing he would have her  intreated   him to compose himself  and endeavour to get a little rest   In the mean   time   said she   I will order things so that I may lie in the same room   with you  and quit your presence neither night nor day        Here he pressed his face close to hers again  in token of the   satisfaction he felt in hearing what she said  and the nurse who   attended him that instant presenting him with some things the physician   had ordered should be given him about that hour  joined her entreaties   with those of Mrs  Munden  that he would try to sleep  to which he made   a sign that he would do so  and  the curtains being drawn  they both   retired to the farther end of the room       As he lay pretty quiet for a considerable time  Mrs  Munden recollected   that there was a thing which friendship and good manners exacted from   her  she had wrote  the very day before  to Lady Loveit  acquainting her   with the motive which had obliged her to quit her brother s house  and   desiring she would favour her with a visit  as soon as convenience would   permit  at the place of her retirement  As she doubted not but the   good nature of this lady would prevail on her to comply with her   request  she could not dispense with sending her an immediate account of   the sudden revolution in her affairs  and the accident which had   occasioned this second removal       She had no sooner dispatched a little billet for this purpose  than the   groans of Mr  Munden  testifying that he was awake  drew both her and   the nurse
