do I not find you languishing on the bed of sickness  and drooping at the infamy of a daughter  who should have been the happy source of your consolation —O  my dear mama  revoke your gracious  your inestimable blessing—Renounce me—curse me—and detest me  for I am detestable in my own eyes  and am ready to commit some instant act of desperation  when I recollect  what ruin I have brought upon you all—What a dreadful return have I made for all your unbounded tenderness and affection  Yet  madam  presumptuous as it must be in me to name either you  my father  or my brother  after what has past  still I must take the liberty of offering up my prayers for the recovery of your peace  still must I pray for the re establishment of my brother s health  who is so great an ornament to the family  if the   26 goodness of that God  who sees into the bottom of my afflictions  would be pleased to restore him  and to take me speedily out of the world  I should hope it was yet possible for you to be happy together  notwithstanding the misconduct of a guilty wretch  who is now so just an object of your contempt and detestation   The good lady Haversham  ever since my arrival in town  has been a constant visitor at Mrs  Darnel s  and tries by every means in her power to alleviate the poignancy of my distress—She laments the behaviour of her brother with the sincerest concern  and has shewn me some letters from him  which give me reason to think he is very sorry for it himself  and is desirous of taking every possible step to effect a reconciliation  but that  madam  is a matter not to be thought of now—He has shewn   27 himself unworthy of being a son to you and my papa  and  for any thing that should depend on my determination  could I gain the world by a union with him  or  what is more  could I recover my lost peace of mind  I should spurn him without hesitation  and think it an increase of my present infamy to retain him a moment in my remembrance—No  madam  though I have disgraced my family by the madness of one guilty moment  my mind is yet incapable of a premeditated baseness  and would scorn to vow duty and obedience  where it cannot look without an equal mixture of abhorrence and contempt  You do not know  my dear mama  how very scandalous a part he has acted  You do not know with how elaborate a meanness  with how ingenious a littleness  he has behaved in the course of this unfortunate transaction  but Miss Beauclerk  in a few days  will be able to   28 make you acquainted with the minutest circumstance  I am writing out the whole melancholy story at her request  and I know it will give your generous bosom some satisfaction to find  that though I am guilty  I have not by any subsequent action rendered myself despicable   Lady Haversham  madam  was this moment here  she came to me in an absolute state of distraction  so that it was a full hour before Mrs  Darnel and I could restore her to any tollerable share of tranquility—She had a letter in her hand directed to Mr  Melmoth  of whom you heard her brother speak so very highly when he was down in the country  This letter  it seems  was a circumstantial account of the unhappy quarrel between my brother and Sir Robert  from which we learn  that the worthless man was coming after me in   29 a great hurry to London  to throw himself at my feet  and to implore my forgiveness for his barbarous behaviour  O  that my brother had not seen him at Reading  his life had then been entirely out of a danger  and I should have the pleasure at least of mortifying his cruel antagonist with a repulse   The countess  when she came a little to herself  entered into a long conversation with me about the impropriety of refusing her brother  since he was now brought to so happy a conviction of his errors  and was attached to me still with so unabating an ardency of affection—   I am sure  my dear Louisa   argued she   notwithstanding you have very great cause for being offended with him  you have not yet erased him from your heart  and it would  of consequence  be punishing yourself  not to think of forgiving him in the end   I begged    30 at last  that her ladyship would say no more on the subject  that it pained me excessively  and that I could never hear her brother s name without reflecting on my own disgrace  and the general dishonour of my family  she then obligingly waved the discourse  but said  that she and Mr  Melmoth were to set off for Mildmay Hall in the morning  and that she hoped to find you and my papa more propitious to her entreaties  than what the justice of my resentment would at present suffer me to be  I then only said  that I had disobliged my papa and mama too much not to wish for some opportunity of making an attonement  but that the circumstance she hinted
