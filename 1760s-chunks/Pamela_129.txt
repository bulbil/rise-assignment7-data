weak all day on Monday  that I could not get out of my bed  My   master shewed great tenderness for me  and I hope he is really sorry    and that this will be his last attempt  but he does not say so neither       He came in the morning  as soon as he heard the door open and I began to   be fearful  He stopped short of the bed  and said  Rather than give you   apprehensions  I will come no farther  I said  Your honour  sir  and   your mercy  is all I have to beg  He sat himself on the side of the bed    and asked kindly  how I did   begged me to be composed  said  I still   looked a little wildly  And I said  Pray  good sir  let me not see this   infamous Mrs  Jewkes  I doubt I cannot bear her sight  She shan t come   near you all this day  if you ll promise to compose yourself  Then    sir  I will try  He pressed my hand very tenderly  and went out  What a   change does this shew   O may it be lasting   But  alas  he seems only   to have altered his method of proceeding  and retains  I doubt  his   wicked purpose       On Tuesday  about ten o clock  when my master heard I was up  he sent   for me down into the parlour  As soon as he saw me  he said  Come nearer   to me  Pamela  I did so  and he took my hand  and said  You begin to   look well again  I am glad of it  You little slut  how did you frighten   me on Sunday night       Sir  said I  pray name not that night  and my eyes overflowed at the   remembrance  and I turned my head aside       Said he  Place some little confidence in me  I know what those charming   eyes mean  and you shall not need to explain yourself  for I do assure   you  that as soon as I saw you change  and a cold sweat bedew your   pretty face  and you fainted away  I quitted the bed  and Mrs  Jewkes   did so too  And I put on my gown  and she fetched her smelling bottle    and we both did all we could to restore you  and my passion for you was   all swallowed up in the concern I had for your recovery  for I thought   I never saw a fit so strong and violent in my life  and feared we should   not bring you to life again  for what I saw you in once before was   nothing to it  This  said he  might be my folly  and my unacquaintedness   with what passion your sex can shew when they are in earnest  But this   I repeat to you  that your mind may be entirely comforted  Whatever I   offered to you  was before you fainted away  and that  I am sure  was   innocent       Sir  said I  that was very bad  and it was too plain you had the worst   designs  When  said he  I tell you the truth in one instance  you may   believe me in the other  I know not  I declare  beyond this lovely   bosom  your sex  but that I did intend what you call the worst is most   certain  and though I would not too much alarm you now  I could curse my   weakness  and my folly  which makes me own  that I love you beyond all   your sex  and cannot live without you  But if I am master of myself  and   my own resolution  I will not attempt to force you to any thing again       Sir  said I  you may easily keep your resolution  if you ll send me out   of your way  to my poor parents  that is all I beg        Tis a folly to talk of it  said he  You must not  shall not go  And   if I could be assured you would not attempt it  you should have better   usage  and your confinement should be made easier to you       But to what end  sir  am I to stay  said I  You yourself seem not sure   you can keep your own present good resolutions  and do you think  if I   was to stay  when I could get away  and be safe  it would not look    as if either I confided too much in my own strength  or would tempt my   ruin  And as if I was not in
