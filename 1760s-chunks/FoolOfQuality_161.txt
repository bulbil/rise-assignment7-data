says         156 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      Mr  Fenton  would you like to go and live with that lady  Oh    sir   cried Ned  could I find in my heart to leave Master Harry and   you  to be sure I would give the world to be with this dear lady    So saying  he catched at her hand and pressed it eagerly to his lips    Mrs  Fielding found herself surprised and agitated by this action    and taking him in her arms  and repeatedly kissing him  the gush of   passion which she had some time suppressed broke forth  and she   shed a plenteous shower of tears upon him      Word being now brought that the chariot was put to rights  and   at the door  Mr  and Mrs  Fielding took a tender farewell of Mr    Fenton and Ned  and set off for London      As we propose  after the manner of the celebrated Vertot  to drop   all the heavy and inanimate parts of our history  and to retain   nothing but the life and spirit thereof  we take the liberty to pass   over a few months  during which nothing material happened  save   that our Harry increased in stature  and in all personal and mental   accomplishments      It was the latter end of August  the weather fair and pleasant    when Harry issued forth to his little Campus martius  accompanied   by Neddy and the faithful James      He was there met by his customary companions in arms   and   they had nearly settled their courses and exercises for the evening    when a young phenomenon of nobility made his appearance like   a phoenix among the vulgar birds  attended by two servants in   flaming liveries      All the boys except Harry  and Ned who kept close to him    immediately approached the glittering stranger  and paid their   respects with admiration and a kind of awkward obeisance  while   Harry eyed him askance with a half sullen and half disdainful   regard   and  notwithstanding the native benevolence of his temper    felt no kind of complacence in his bosom toward him      The young nobleman  to make a parade of his wealth  and at the   same time to indulge his petulance of disposition  took a handful of   sixpences and shillings from his pocket  and throwing them among   the crew  cried A scramble  boys a scramble       Hereupon a scuffle royal instantly ensued  All of them  save   three  eagerly grappled at the pieces that had fixed their eye   while   each  at the same time  seized and struggled with his fellow  Our   hero  meanwhile  observed all that passed with a distinguishing   attention  But  as the cause of quarrel was quickly conveyed from   sight  nothing worse happened than a few trips and boxes  to which   the parties had been accustomed  and therefore did not resent   in    somuch that my lord was wholly defeated of the benevolent   intention of his generosity  and looked upon himself as defrauded of   his coin      To compensate this disappointment  and to make surer for the   future of his dearly beloved mischief  he took a crown piece from his   pocket  and  holding it up to the full view of the assembly  he pro    claimed it as the prize of victory between any two who should step   forth on the spot and engage in a boxing match  At the word an   unknown champion sprung forward  instantly stripped  and chal    lenged the field                THE FOOL OF QUALITY  157     This unknown had arrived but that very morning with his parents    who came to settle at the village  He was by nature a very valiant   but very quarrelsome boy  He had  consequently  been engaged in   a number of occasional combats  wherein he had generally come off   victorious   and this gave him as full an assurance of conquest as   though his brow had already received the wreath      The stranger in bulk and stature exceeded the field  and no one   had yet offered himself an antagonist  when Harry stepping up    thus addressed him in a gentle but admonishing accent       I find  sir  you are a stranger   you are therefore to be excused   for behaving amiss  as you are yet unacquainted with the laws of   this place  But I must now be so free to inform you  that whoever   quarrels here or boxes for money must afterwards take a turn with   me for nothing  As well before as after
