of returning to   Lord      without having done the business he was sent upon  he   therefore sat down  and waited till the other came  which was somewhat   sooner than the time he had been made to hope       These gentlemen  though far from being intimately acquainted  were not   altogether strangers  having frequently met at the levee of Lord         They now saluted each other with the utmost politeness  after which  Mr    Munden drawing him to the most retired part of the room   I have had a   chase after you  Sir   said he   for a good part of this afternoon  and   which would have been impertinent in me  if not excuseable by my being   under an indispensable obligation of seeing you         Then  Sir   replied the other   whatever the business be  I shall think   myself happy in being found     This  Sir  will inform you   said Mr    Munden  giving him the letter   From Lord        cried Mr  W      as   soon as he saw the superscription   It is so   answered Mr  Munden   and   I am heartily sorry for the occasion        Mr  W     made no reply to what Mr  Munden said  till he had examined   the contents of the letter  and then  after putting it into his pocket   with a careless air   I see into the meaning of this   said he   an ugly   accident  which I have but lately discovered  has  I believe    misrepresented me to his lordship  Could I be capable of what he at   present thinks I am  I should be utterly unworthy of the condescension   he vouchsafes me by this invitation  but  Sir  all this is founded on a   mistake  which may easily be rectified  I will not give his lordship the   trouble of going to the Green Park  I will wait on him at his own house   at the hour he mentions  and if what I have to say to him does not fully   convince him of my innocence  will follow either to that  or any other   place he pleases  though no consideration in the world  except his own   commands  should compel me to draw my sword against a breast I so much   love and reverence        Mr  Munden replied  that he should be extremely glad to find an affair    which at present seemed to threaten such fatal consequences  was   amicably made up  and  after having assured him that he would deliver   what he had said to his lordship in the most exact manner  was about to   take his leave  but could not do it so soon as he desired  the other   still detaining him by beginning some subject or other of conversation    which  how frivolous soever  Mr  Munden could not break off too   suddenly  without incurring the censure of abruptness and ill manners       Lord      in the mean time was in the utmost agitation  not for the   return of Mr  Munden  for he very well knew the message he would bring    but that he had taken a great deal of pains to no purpose  the beauty of   Mrs  Munden had inspired him with the most eager desire of enjoying her    the gaiety of her temper  joined to the temptations in his power to   offer  had given him an almost assured hope of gaining her  and now  to   find himself thus repulsed  repulsed with such disdain  left a surprize   upon him which very much increased the shock of his disappointment       Besides  as he doubted not but she would inform her husband of all that   had passed between them  it gave the most mortal stab to that   haughtiness too incident to opulence and grandeur  to reflect he had   given a man  so much beneath him  an opportunity of triumphing over him   in his mind       He had not recovered his confusion  and was walking backwards and   forwards in his drawing room  with a disordered motion  when Mr  Munden   returned  to whom he never spoke  nor looked upon  The satisfaction this   gentleman had felt on finding the business of his embassy was like to   terminate so happily  was very much damped at seeing himself received in   this manner        I did not expect to find your lordship alone   said Mr  Munden   I   believe not   replied he   but an unlucky accident at home deprived me
