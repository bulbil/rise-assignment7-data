are some who  born without any share of sensibility  receive favour after favour  and still cringe for more  who accept the offer of generosity with as little reluctance as the wages of merit  and even make thanks for past benefits an indirect petition for new  such I grant can suffer no debasement from dependance  since they were originally as vile as was possible to be  dependance degrades only the ingenuous  but leaves the sordid mind in pristine meanness  In this manner therefore long continued generosity is misplaced  or it is injurious  it either finds a man worthless  or it makes him so  and true it is  that the person who is contented to be often obliged  ought not to have been obliged at all   Yet while I describe the meanness of a life of continued dependance  I would not be thought to include those natural or political subordinations which subsist in every society  for in such  tho  dependance is exacted from the inferior  yet the obligation on either side is mutual  The son must rely upon his parent for support  but the parent lies under the same obligations to give  that the other has to expect  the subordinate officer must receive the commands of his superior  but for this obedience the former has a right to demand an intercourse of favour  such is not the dependance I would depreciate  but that where every expected favour must be the result of mere benevolence in the giver  where the benefit can be kept without remorse  or transferred without injustice  The character of a legacy hunter  for instance is   144 detestable in some countries  and despicable in all  this universal contempt of a man who infringes upon none of the laws of society  some moralists have arraigned as a popular and unjust prejudice  never considering the necessary degradations a wretch must undergo  who previously expects to grow rich by benefits without having either natural or social claims to enforce his petitions   But this intercourse of benefaction and acknowledgement is often injurious even to the giver as well as the receiver  a man can gain but little knowledge of himself  or of the world  amidst a circle of those whom hope or gratitude has gathered round him  their unceasing humiliations must necessarily encrease his comparative magnitude  for all men measure their own abilities by those of their company  thus being taught to overrate his merit  he in reality lessens it  encreasing in confidence  but not in power  his professions end in empty boast  his undertakings in shameful disappointment   It is perhaps one of the severest misfortunes of the great  that they are  in general  obliged to live among men whose real value is lessened by dependance  and whose minds are enslaved by obligation  The humble companion may have at first accepted patronage with generous views  but soon he feels the mortifying influence of conscious inferiority  by degrees sinks into a flatterer  and from flattery at last degenerates into stupid veneration  To remedy this the great often dis miss their old dependants  and take new  Such changes are falsely imputed to levity  falsehood    145 or caprice  in the patron  since they may be more justly ascribed to the client s gradual deterioration   No  my son  a life of independance is generally a life of virtue  It is that which fits the soul for every generous flight of humanity  freedom  and friendship  To give should be our pleasure  but to receive our shame  serenity  health  and affluence attend the desire of rising by labour  misery  repentance  and disrespect that of succeeding by extorted benevolence  the man who can thank himself alone for the happiness he enjoys is truly blest  and lovely  far more lovely the sturdy gloom of laborious indigence  than the fawning simper of thriving adulation  Adieu   LETTER XCVIII  From Lien Chi Altangi  to Fum Hoam  first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin  in China   IN every society some men are born to teach  and others to receive instruction  some to work  and others to enjoy in idleness the fruits of their industry  some to govern  and others to obey  Every people  how free soever  must be contented to give up part of their liberty and judgment to those who govern  in exchange for their hopes of security  and the motives which first influenced their choice in the election of their governors should ever be weighed against the succeeding apparent inconsistencies of their conduct  All cannot be rulers  and men are generally best   146 governed by a few  In making way thro  the intricacies of business  the smallest obstacles are apt to retard the execution of what is to be planned by a multiplicity of counsels  the judgment of one alone being always fittest for winding through the labyrinths of intrigue  and the obstructions of disappointment  A serpent  which  as the fable observes  is furnished with one head and many tails  is much more capable of subsistence and expedition  than another  which is furnished with but one tail and many heads   Obvious as these truths are  the people of this country seem insensible of their force  Not satisfied with the advantages of internal peace and opulence  they still murmur at their governors  and interfere
