to own that I doubted  Have you  madam  a material objection to an early day  Be so good to inform me  if you have  I wish to remove every shadow of doubt from your heart   I was silent  He proceeded   Let me not pain you  madam —lifting my hand to his lips—I would not pain you for the world  You have seen the unhappy Olivia  You have perhaps heard her story from herself  What must be the cause upon which self partiality cannot put a gloss  Because I knew not how  It was shocking to my nature  to repulse a Lady  she took my pity for encouragement  Pity from a Lady of a man  is noble—The declaration of pity from a man for a woman  may be thought a vanity bordering upon insult  Of such a nature is not mine—She has some noble qualities—from my heart  for her character s sake  I pity Olivia  and the more  for that violence of temper which she never was taught to restrain  If  madam  you have any scruples on her account  own them  I will  for I honestly can  remove them   O Sir  None  None —Not the least  on that unhappy Lady s account—  Let me say  proceeded he  that Olivia reveres you  and wish•s you  I hope cordially  for she is afraid still of your sister excellence  to be mine  Give me leave to boast  It is my boast   that tho  I have had pain from individuals of your Sex  I can look back on my past life  and bless God that I never  from childhood to manhood  WILFULLY gave pain either to the MOTHERLY or SISTERLY heart  a   nor from manhood to the present hour  to any other woman   O Sir  Sir —What is it you call pain  if at this instant  and I said it with tears  that which your goodness makes me feel  is not so —The dear  the excellent Clementina  What a perverseness is in her fate  She  and she only  could have deserved you     184 He bent his knee to the greatly honoured Harriet—I acknowlege with transport  said he  the joy you give me by your magnanimity  such a more than sisterly magnanimity to that of Clementina  How nobly do you authorize my regard for her —In you  madam  shall I have all her excellencies  without the abatements which must have been allowed  had she been mine  from considerations of Religion and Country  Believe me  madam  that my Love of her  if I know my heart is of such a nature  as never can abate the fervor of that I vow to you  To both of you  my principal attachment was to MIND  Yet let me say  that the personal union  to which you discourage me not to aspire  and the duties of that most intimate of all connexions  will preserve to you the due preference  as  allow me to say  it would have done to her  had she accepted of my vows   O Sir  believe me incapable of affectation  of petulance  of disguise  My heart  Why should I not speak freely to Sir Charles Grandison   is wholly yours —It never knew another Lord  I will flatter myself  that  had you never known Lady Clementina  and had she not been a prior Love  you never would have had a divided heart —What pain must you have had in the conflict  My regard for you  bids me acknowlege my own vanity  in my pity for you   I gushed into tears—You must leave me  Sir—I cannot bear the exaltation you have given me   I turned away my face  I thought I should have fainted   He clasped me to his bosom  He put his cheek to mine  For a moment we neither of us could speak   He broke the short silence  I dread the effects on your tender health  of the pain I  or rather your own greatness of mind  give you  Beloved of my heart  kissing my cheek  wet at that moment with the tears of both  forgive me —And be assured  that Reverence will always accompany my Love  Will it be too   185 much  just now  to re urge the day that shall answer the wishes of Clementina  of her noble brothers  of all our own friends  and make you wholly mine   His air was so noble  his eyes shewed so much awe  yet such manly dignity  that my heart gave way to its natural impulse—Why  Sir  should I not declare my reliance on your candour  My honour  in the world s eye  I entrust to you  But bid men ot do an improper thing  left my desire of obliging you should make me forget myself   Was not this a generous resignation  Did it not deserve a generous return  But he  even Sir Charles Grandison  endeavoured to make his advantage of it  Letters from Italy unreceived  as if he thought my reference to those a punctilio also   What a deposit —Your honour  madam  is safely entrusted  Can punctilio be
