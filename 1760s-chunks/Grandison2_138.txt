joined with the two brothers in invoking blessings upon me     345 So much  my dear Dr  Bartlett  for this night  The past day is a day that I am not displeased with   LETTER XXXVI  Dr  BARTLETT  To Miss BYRON    March 18   I Present to you  madam  the account you desired to see  as extracted by my kinsman from my papers  You seemed to wish it to be hastened for you  It is not what it might have been  but more facts  I presume  will answer your intention  Be pleased  therefore  to accept it with your usual goodness    DR  Bartlett went abroad as governor of a young man of quality  Mr  Lorimer  I am to call him  to conceal his real name  He was the very reverse of young Mr  Grandison  He was not only rude and ungovernable  but proud  ill natured  malicious  even base    The Doctor was exceedingly averse to take upon him the charge of the wicked youth abroad  having had too many instances of the badness of his nature while in England  But he was prevailed upon by the solicitations of his father  who represented it as an act of the greatest charity to him and his family  as well as by the solemn promises of good behaviour from the young man  for he was known to regard the advice of Dr  Bartlett more than that of any other person    The Doctor and Mr  Lorimer were at Turin  when young Mr  Grandison  who had been some months in France  for the first time arrived in that city  then in the eighteenth year of his age    Dr  Bartlett had not a more profligate pupil  than Mr  Grandison had a governor  tho  recommended by General W  his uncle by the mother s side  It   346 used to be observed in places where they made but a few days residence  that the young gentleman ought to have been the governor  Monsieur Creutzer the governed  Mr  Grandison had  in short  the happiness  by his prudence  to escape several snares laid for his virtue  by a wretch  who hoped  if he could betray him into them  to silence the remonstrances of the young man  upon his evil conduct  and to hinder him from complaining of him to his father    Mr  Grandison became acquainted with Dr  Bartlett at Turin  Monsieur Creutzer  at the same time  commenced an intimacy with Mr  Lorimer  and the two former were not more united from good qualities  than the two latter were from bad    Several riotous things were done by Creutzer and Lorimer  who  whatever the Doctor could do to separate them  were hardly ever asunder  One of their enormities fell under the cognizance of the civil magistrate  and was not made easy to Lorimer without great interest and expence  While Creutzer fled to Rome  to avoid condign punishment  and wrote to Mr  Grandison to join him there    Then it was  that Mr  Grandison wrote  as he had often ineffectually threatened to do  to represent to his father the profligacy of the man  and to request him to appoint him another governor  or to permit him to return to England till he had made choice of one for him  begging of Dr  Bartlett  that he would allow him   till he had an answer from his father  to apply to him for advice and instruction    The answer of his father was  That he heard of his prudence from every mouth  That he was at liberty to chuse what companion he pleased  But that he gave him no governor but his own discretion    Mr  Grandison then  more earnestly than before  and with an humility and diffidence  suited to his natural generosity of temper  that never grew upon indulgence  besought the Doctor s direction    347 And when they were obliged to separate  they established a correspondence which never will end but with the life of one of them    Mr  Grandison laid before the Doctor all his plans  submitting his conduct to him  as well with regard to the prosecution of his studies  as to his travels  But they had not long corresponded in this manner  when the Doctor let him know  that it was needless to consult him aforehand  and the more so  as it often occasioned a suspension of excellent resolutions  But he besought him to continue to him  an account of all he undertook  of all he performed  and of every material incident of his life  not only as his narrations would be matter of the highest entertainment to him  but as they would furnish him with lessons from example  that might be of greater force upon the unhappy Lorimer  than his own precepts    While the Doctor was passing thro  but a few of the cities in Lombardy  Mr  Grandison made almost the tour of Europe  and yet gave himself time to make such remarks upon persons  places  and things  as could hardly be believed to be the observations of so young a man  Lorimer  mean
