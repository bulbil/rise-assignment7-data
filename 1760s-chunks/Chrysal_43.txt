that time  about the liberty of cutting sticks   upon a desert shore  it was necessary to secure a safe passage for the   treasure by establishing a right understanding with the commander    of an Engish man of war  which was cruising in those seas  It fell   to my lot to go on this errand in the shape of a doubloon into    which I was oast to save the profanation which a crucifix must   suffer in the hands of heretics      There was some little address requisite to conduct this afiair   with the captain in such a manner as to keep it secret from his   officers  to gain all of whom would have been too expensive   besides   that he would never trust his sarced honour to the fidelity of so    many  But this was readily adjusted  The refinements of modem   politeness having softened the natural ferocity of a state of war    and admitting an intercourse of courtesy between parties who    profess to seek each other s destruction  the Spanish governor sent       According to Davis s Olio  the commander here referred to was   Captain Harry Powlett or Paulet  afterwards sixth Duke of Boltoa  who    is alluded to later on in a similar episode  where his conduct earns him   the nickname of   Captain Sternpost    This oificer brought charges of   misconduct against Admiral Griffin for failing to engage the enemy  and   obtained a verdict against him  Griffin beiug suspended from his rank   and employment  Griffin retaliated two years later by similar charges   against Powlett  but was unable to bring substantiating evidence    Chrysal  however  compares the two cases in a way that precludes the   idea that the culprit was one and the same person in both  Davis has    probably mixed up two men of the same name   and  if so  this would be   another Captain Powlett of the Tilbury  who was reprimanded by a    court martial for his dilatoriaess in coming into action on an attempt   to intercept the Spanish plate fleet  1748  off Havana  Most of the   enemy got away  through the mishandling of the British ships  and the    Admiral  Sir Charles Knowles  did not escape censure          â€¢28 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA      out a boat with his compliments to the English captain with a   large supply of fresh provisions  fruits  wine  etc      This necessarily produced a return of civility from the well bret     captain   and in this intercourse were the terms of his connivance   settled  as the seal of which I was delivered to him among a very   large number of my fellows   who  honourably punctual to his   promise  at the appointed time sailed away from that station in   quest of some ships of the enemy s which he expected to meet else    where  and did not return till the Spanish treasure was beyond   his reach      As this was a compliment of great consequence to the Spaniards    the captain had been so handsomely considered for it that his desires   were satisfied  and he only wished to be safe at home to enjoy the   wealth he had so happily acquired  Often would he take me out     for the beauty of my new impression had struck his eye and gained   me the honour of being kept in his purse   often  I say  would he   take me out of his purse and  gazing on me till his eyes watered       O thou end of all my toils and dangers     would he say    thou   crown of all my hopes   now I have obtained thee I am content     Let others seek that phantom  Glory   I have in thee the more solid   reward  for which I always sought  nor shall anything tempt me   to hazard being separated from thee     a resolution which he had   an opportunity of showing in all its strength a few days after    when a ship appeared which he thought to be a Spanish man of war      As ours was a ship of force  and all the officers except the captain   were very poor   and as the Spanish ships are always richly laden   with treasure in those seas  the crew was in the highest spirits at   this sight  and made everything ready to attack her with the most    eager alacrity  But the case was quite different with the captain    He was now as rich as he desired  and dreaded the loss of that   wealth which he had so long laboured for  He therefore retired   anto his cabin while the lieutenants were clearing ship  and  taking   me out
