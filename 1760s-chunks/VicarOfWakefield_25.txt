for the future —   Madam    cried Burchell  with looks of great composure  which tended to enflame her the more    as for secret reasons  you are right  I have secret reasons  which I forbear to mention  because you are not able to answer those of which I make no secret  but I find my visits here are become troublesome  I ll take my leave therefore now  and perhaps come once more to take a final farewell when I am quitting the country    Thus saying  he took up his hat  nor could the attempts of Sophia  whose looks seemed to upbraid his precipitancy  prevent his going     When gone  we all regarded each other for some minutes with confusion  My wife  who knew herself to be the cause  strove to hide her concern with a forced smile   Page  128  and an air of assurance  which I was willing to reprove    How  woman    cried I to her    is it thus we treat strangers  Is it thus we return their kindness  Be assured  my dear  that these were the harshest words  and to me the most unpleasing that ever escaped your lips    —   Why would he provoke me then    replied she    but I know the motives of his advice perfectly well  He would prevent my girls from going to town  that he may have the pleasure of my youngest daughter s company here at home  But whatever happens  she shall chuse better company than such low lived fellows as he    —   Low lived  my dear  do you call him    cried I    it is very possible we may mistake this man s character  for he seems upon some occasions the most finished gentleman I ever knew —Tell me  Sophia  my girl  has he ever given you any secret instances of his attachment    —   His conversation with me  sir    replied my daughter    has ever been sensible  modest   Page  129  and pleasing  As to aught else  no  never  Once  indeed  I remember to have heard him say he never knew a woman who could find merit in a man that seemed poor     Such  my dear    cried I    is the common cant of all the unfortunate or idle  But I hope you have been taught to judge properly of such men  and that it would be even madness to expect happiness from one who has been so very bad an oeconomist of his own  Your mother and I have now better prospects for you  The next winter  which you will probably spend in town  will give you opportunities of making a more prudent choice      What Sophia s reflections were upon this occasion  I can t pretend to determine  but I was not displeased at the bottom that we were rid of a guest from whom I had much to fear  Our breach of hospitality went to my conscience a little  but I quickly silenced that monitor by two or three specious reasons  which served to  Page  130  satisfy and reconcile me to myself  The pain which conscience gives the man who has already done wrong  is soon got over  Conscience is a coward  and those faults it has not strength enough to prevent  it seldom has justice enough to punish by accusing   Page   unnumbered   CHAP  XIV   Fresh mortifications  or a demonstration that seeming calamities may be real blessings   THE journey of my daughters to town was now resolved upon  Mr  Thornhill having kindly promised to inspect their conduct himself  and inform us by letter of their behaviour  But it was thought indispensably necessary that their appearance should equal the greatness of their expectations  which could not be done without some expence  We debated therefore in full council what were the easiest methods of raising money  or  more properly speaking  what we could most conveniently sell  The deliberation was soon finished  it was found that our remaining  Page  132  horse was utterly useless for the plow  without his companion  and equally unfit for the road  as wanting an eye  it was therefore determined that we should dispose of him for the purposes above mentioned  at the neighbouring fair  and  to prevent imposition  that I should go with him myself  Though this was one of the first mercantile transactions of my life  yet I had no doubt about acquitting myself with reputation  The opinion a man forms of his own prudence is measured by that of the company he keeps  and as mine was mostly in the family way  I had conceived no unfavourable sentiments of my worldly wisdom  My wife  however  next morning  at parting  after I had got some paces from the door  called me back  to advise me  in a whisper  to have all my eyes about me   I had  in the usual forms  when I came to the fair  put my horse through all his paces  but for some time had no bidders  At last
