superior   art and influence of God or man      In the designings of sculptors  of painters  and statuaries  we   however see very great and truly affecting beauty  I have  at   times  been melted into tears thereby   and have felt within my   bosom the actual emotions of distress and compassion  of friend    ship and of love  I ask  then  what it was that excited these   sensations  Could any lines  colourings  or mere symmetry of   inanimate parts  inspire affections  of which in themselves they   were incapable   No   they could only serve as the vehicles of   something intended to inspire such sensibilities  nothing further    We must therefore look higher for a cause more adequate to such   extraordinary effects  and the first that presents itself is the   designer  who must have conceived amiable sentiments within   himself  before he could impress their beauty on these his inter    preters  in order to excite suitable affections in others      Here then it is evident  that whatever we affect or love in the   design  is no other than the sentiment or soul of the designer    though we neither see nor know any thing further concerning   him  And thus a sculptor  a painter  a statuary  or amiable   author  by conveying their sentiments in lasting and intelligible   characters to mankind  may make the world admirers and lovers   of their beauty  when their features shall be rigid and incapable   of expression  and when they themselves shall no longer exist   among men      From hence it should seem  as indeed I am fully persuaded    that mind can affectingly love nothing but mind   and that   universal nature can exhibit no single grace or beauty that does   not arise from sentiment alone          TEE FOOL OF QUALITY          135         The power of this sentimental beauty  as I may say  is in many   cases great  amazing  and has not yet been accounted for  that I   know of  by any philosopher  poet  or author  though several have   made it their peculiar study and subject  We have seen and read   of many instances where it carries people  as it were  quite put of   themselves  and gives them to live and to be interested in the   object of their affections alone  They will run to fight  bleed    suffer  and even to die in its defence   and in its absence they will   pine and despair  and attempt to destroy themselves  rather than   bear to be divided from what they love in a manner above their   own existence      This is wonderful  perhaps mysterious  and may possibly be in    volved in impenetrable darkness  Let us try  however  if we can   throw any probable lights upon it       We have already seen that human artificers can impress the   beauty of their own sentiments on their inanimate works  Sup    pose  then  that God should be barely the same to universal nature   that a finite designer is to the piece he has in hand  He finds   that the stuff or material which he is to form and to inform  is   in itself utterly incapable of any thing that is desirable  He   therefore finds himself under the necessity of imparting to his   works some faint manifestation or similitude of himself  for   otherwise they cannot be amiable  neither can he see his shadow   in them with any delight  On matter  therefore  he first impresses   such distant characters of his own beauty as the subject will bear    in the glory of the heavens  in the movement of the planets  in the   symmetry of form  in the harmony of sounds  in the elegance of   colours  in the elaborate texture of the smallest leaf  and in the   infinitely fine mechanism of such insects and minims of nature as   are scarce visible to eyes of the clearest discernment      But when God comes towards home  if the phrase may be   allowed   when he impresses on intelligent spirits a nearer resem    blance of himself  and imparts to them also a perception and   relish of the beauty with which he has formed them he then   delights to behold  and will eternally delight to behold his image    so fairly reflected by such a living mirror  Yet still they are no   other than his own beauties that he beholds in his works  for   his omnipotence can impress  but cannot possibly detach  a single   grace from himself      I am not quite singular in this opinion  I have somewhere
