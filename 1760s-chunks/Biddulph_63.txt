my fright  made me faint away  in this condition Mr Faulkland found me  and carried me out in his arms  for my companion was too anxious for her own safety  to suffer her husband to stay to give me any assistance  so that he had only time to beg of the men about him not to let me perish   I soon recovered  upon being carried into the open air  and found myself seated on some planks  at a little distance from the booth  Mr Faulkland supporting me  and two or three other people about me  whom he had called to my assistance   Indebted to him as I was for saving my life  my spirits were at that time too much agitated to thank him as I ought   He told me  he had stepped behind the scenes to speak to somebody  and was there when the stage took fire  that he then ran to give what assistance he could to the ladies that were in the house  observe he distinguished not me in particular   and had just come in when he saw me meet with the accident  which had occasioned my fainting away  and when the gentleman  who was with me  was calling for help  but at the same time getting out as fast as he could   I now began to recollect myself  I was uneasy at Mr Faulkland’s    presence  I wished him away  I beseeched him to return once more to the booth  to see if every one had got out safe  for I told him I had seen several of my female acquaintance there  for whom I was alarmed  With the assistance of the people about me  I said I could make a shift to get to the nearest house  which was not above a hundred yards off  from whence I should send home for my chariot  which I had ordered to come to me after the play  He begged I would give him leave to see me safe to that house  but I would not permit him  and he left me in the care of two women and a man  who had come to be spectators of the fire   With the help of these people  I contrived to hobble  for my ancle pained me exceedingly  to the place I mentioned  which happened to be a public house  All the rooms below were full  and the woman of the house very obligingly helped me up stairs into her own chamber  I called for a glass of water  which was immediately brought me  and I desired the woman to send some one to my house  which was at about a mile’s distance  to order my chariot to come to me immediately   While the woman went to execute my instructions  I had thrown myself into a chair that stood close to the wainscot  I heard a bell ring  and presently a waiter entered  and asked if I wanted any thing  I told him  no  He ran hastily out of the room  and entering the next to that where I was sitting  I heard a voice  which I knew to be Mr Arnold’s  ask  Were the servants found  The man replying that they were not  Then  said Mr Arnold  tell your mistress she will oblige me if she will let me have her chaise to carry this lady home  The waiter presently withdrew  and without reflecting on the particularity of Mr Arnold’s being there with a lady  about whom I formed no conjectures  I was about to rise off my chair to go in to him  but being almost disabled from walking  I was obliged to creep along  holding by the wainscot  when a tender exclamation of Mr Arnold’s stopped me  My dearest creature  said he to his companion  you have not yet recovered your fright  A female voice answered him with some fond expressions  which I could not hear distinctly enough to discover whose it was  but I was soon put out of doubt  when the lady added  in a louder tone  Do you know that your wife was at the play to night  Mr Arnold answered  No  I hope she did not see me  Mrs Gerrarde  for I perceived it was she who spoke  replied  I hope not  because perhaps she might expect you home after the play  Though Mr Arnold  in his first emotion of surprize at hearing that I was at the    play  was only anxious lest I should have observed him  yet he was not so lost to humanity as to be indifferent whether I escaped the flames or not  I am surprized I did not see her  said he  I wish she may have got out of the house safe  You are very sollicitous about her  replied Mrs Gerrarde  peevishly  there was one there perhaps as anxious for her preservation as you are—The conversation I found here was likely to become extremely critical for me  but I was prevented from hearing any more  by the woman of the house  who just then entered the room to ask me how I did  and to know if I wanted any thing   I had heard enough to convince me that my presence would be very unacceptable both to Mr Arnold and his companion
