of it  This only I shall say  that the   practice of mankind seems to contradict the second of these opinions   who show no regard to the dispositions of those on whom they   propagate their own species  though they trace back the pedigree   of a dog or a horse for many generations  for fear of any fault in   the breed  the reason you may perhaps imagine why the brutes   fed with such care are found so much seldomer to degenerate than   the offspring of the greatest men      1 The Duke of Cumberland  During the debates on the Begency Bill   jn 1751  Fox made an indignant defence of his patron against an attack   by Pitt  Fox s colleague in the government  and left the house without   voting          410 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA         CHAPTER XXIX     CONTINUED   HE PBACTISBS A StrCCBSSFtTL METHOD FOR GAINING   THE CONPIDBNCB OF HIS NEW PATKON  WHICH HB TOBNS TO GOOD   ACCOrrNT â€” HISTOBY OP THE LOVER WHO SITOCEBDED HIM IN THE   GOOD GRACES OP HIS LATB KEEPER â€”  HE STRIVES TO PREVENT HIS   TAKING ADVANTAGE OP HIS INPLTTBNCE OVER HER  AND PINDINQ   HE PAILS IN THAT  POOLS HIM INTO DISTRESS  WHICH BRINGS HIS   LIPB IN HIS POWER â€” HE SLIGHTS MANY MOTIVES  WHICH MIGHT   HAVE HAD WEIGHT WITH OTHERS  AND TAKES ADVANTAGE OP THE   OPPORTUNITY TO GET BID OF HIM AND ALL PURTHBR TROUBLE   ABOUT HIM â€” HB CONTINUES TO DUPE HIM TILL THE LAST MOMENT    WHEN HIS EYES ABB OPENED  AND ALL COMES OUT     As soon as he had insinuated himself into the pleasurable liking   of his designed patron  by an unwearied exertion of all his powers   of pleasing  he directly proceeded  with the nicest art  to improve   that liking into an important confidence  He watched his every   action  word  and look  till he discovered the peculiar turn of his   mind  to which he accommodated his own so implicitly  that the   very faculties of his soul seemed to move only by the other s will    They who are above deceit themselves  suspect it not in others    That self love  which is inseparable from humanity  was easily   imposed upon by such art  His patron liked himself in him  and   insensibly came to think all reserve unnecessary with one whose   soul appeared to be only the shadow of his own  This soon gave   him real consequence  as the numbers whom interest or inclination   attached to his patron found it necessary to take the lead from   him  and enabled him to grasp at every opportunity of engrossing   power  and acquiring wealth to supply those pleasures which he   had quitted only from necessity  and returned to again the moment   he had the means of obtaining them  But all this torrent of success   was not able to divert his attention for a moment from the smallest   matter in which his avarice was concerned  as he gave the strongest   proof in the following affair  to explain which I must look back   to the woman whose lavish fondness first raised his fortune  as it   happened in consequence of his connection with her  though some   considerable time after her death      It is observed that habitual indulgence continues the passions   proper to youth after the fire that first supplied them is exhausted    and the end for which they were implanted by nature become   impossible  Old as this woman was when our hero deserted her    and to appearance as incapable of feeling as raising desire  she had   BO long accustomed herself to the gratification of every sensual   appetite  that she could not bear to live without a lover  The   difficulty was  how to fix upon a proper object  for as interest was   her only attraction  the first glances must necessarily come from her    and then her prodigality to her last had put it out of her power   to make it worth the while of such another as she might like to   supply his place  Precluded thus from much delicacy in her choice          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 411     necessity directed her to one of her domestics   sometliing in whose   circumstances pointed him out more particularly to her notice      There is not a more despicable instance of vanity than being   ashamed of the oonnectiona of nature  because of poverty  when   that poverty is not the efiect of vice  A far distant female relation   had from this vanity bequeathed to her a very considerable fortune    to which this man should have been heir  had not the lowness of his   condition  a motive sufficient to have influenced a generous heart   in his favour  made her think it would be a
