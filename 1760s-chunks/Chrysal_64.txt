 His son  whose near prospect of such an im    mense inheritance did not efface his filial duty and affection  was   shocked at such an instance of avarice  and  though he dared not   contradict  was resolved to counteract it  Accordingly  when he   was sent for the surgeon  for his father had not revealed his retreat   to any of his servants  for obvious reasons   instead of going to the   quack  as he was directed  he went to one of the most eminent   surgeons of the age  and revealing the whole affair to him  prevailed   on him  for a large gratification  to disguise himself and undertake   to perform the operation for whatever trifle should be offered him    and then told his father with an appearance of joy that as he was   going for the advertising surgeon  he had luckily met  in an alehouse    where he was directed to inquire for him  a person who had been for   many years a surgeon s mate on board a man of war  who he was   sure would cut off his leg  not only much better  but cheaper also    as his appearance showed that he was starving  and must be glad   to take whatever he could get      Such a lucky hit raised the old man s spirits  so that he submitted   to the operation without further concern  which was performed in   so masterly a manner that  in a fit of imwonted generosity  he gave   the surgeon half a guinea  though he had bargained with him for   a crown   but then he coniforted hitoself  when he began afterwards   to reflect upon his extravagance  that he could stop it out of the   fees for his attendance  In the same manner as he had imposed   a good surgeon upon him  did his unfashionable son supply him with   all things necessary for his condition  by making a woman in whom   he could confide bring them every day  as if from a lady of fortune    a patient of the surgeon s  to whom he had represented him as an   object of charity   for if he had had no other support but what he   allowed himself  he must have perished for want of proper nourish    ment  When his cure was completed by this management  and he   came to discharge the surgeon  after lamenting his inabiUty to make   a more suitable return  he offered him a couple of guineas   but the   surgeon not thinking it necessary to carry on the deceit any longer    now the end was answered  told him that he need make no apology    for his son had already given him two hundred        My son  sir   I do not understand you    answered the wretch    in the most violent agitations of surprise  confusion  and rage        Yes  sir    repUed the surgeon  addressing him by his name  and   telling his own     your son  to whom you are indebted for your Ufa   more ways than one  for it was he that supplied you with the things   which you imagined to have been sent you out of charity        Shocking as this discovery was  the old miser recovered presence         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 55     of mind to carry it ofi in an admirable manner    Sir    said he      I have a proper sense of my son s duty  and of your skill in your   profession  though you have prevented me from making an acknow    ledgment of them in the manner I intended   for you must not   think that I have been deceived   I knew you all along   and I re    moved to this place  and took this method of concealing myself    both to avoid the trouble and impertinence of visitors and comph    mentary messages and to make trial of my son s duty  of which I   have now had a sufficient proof        Saying this  he took the surgeon by the hand and accepted his   offer of continuing to attend him tiU his wound should be quite healed   with the greater readiness  as he was paid already  But to his son   he behaved in a different manner   for he directly made a new will    by which he bequeathed his immense fortune to the next brother    the person before us  leaving the other to pine out his days in poverty   on a poor annuity  in reward for his obedience and duty  in the very   words of his wiU   an injustice that was further aggravated by his   having made him relinquish the most promising hopes
