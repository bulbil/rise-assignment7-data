my walk  and then left me to continue my progress  I could not help paying the tribute of a sigh to the memory of that ill fated duenna  and her decease affected me the more  because I taxed myself with that melancholy catastrophe  though a moment s reflection would have convinced me  that the grave owed its precious prey to the inroads of her cancer rather than to the cruel charms of my person   I looked with an eye of pleasure upon everything worth notice in the town  The archbishop s marble palace feasted my eyes with all the magnificence of architecture  nor were the piazzas which surrounded the exchange much inferior in commercial grandeur  but a large building at a distance  with a great crowd standing before the doors  attracted all my attention  I went nearer  to ascertain the reason why so great a concourse of both sexes was collected  and was soon let into the secret by reading the following inscription in letters of gold on a tablet of black marble over the door  La Posada de los Representantes  The theatre    The play bills announced for that day a new tragedy  never performed  and gave the name of Don Gabriel Triaquero as the author       CH  V     Gil Blas goes to the play  and sees a new tragedy  The success of the piece  The public taste at Valencia   I STOPPED for some minutes before the door  to make my remarks on the people who were going in  There were some of all sorts and sizes  Here was a knot of genteel looking fellows  whose tailors at least had done justice to their fashionable pretensions  there a mob of ill favoured and ill mannered mortals  in a garb to identify vulgarity  To the right was a bevy of noble ladies  alighting from their carriages to take possession of their private boxes  to the left a tribe of female traders in lubricity  who came to sell their wares in the lobby  This mixed concourse of spectators  as various in their minds as in their faces  gave me an itching inclination to increase their number  Just as I was taking my check  the governor and his lady drove up  They spied me out in the crowd  and having sent for me  took me with them to their box  what I placed myself behind them  in such a position as to converse at my ease with either   The theatre was filled with spectators from the ceiling downwards  the pit thronged almost to suffocation  and the stage crowded with knights of the three military orders  Here is a full house  said I to Don Alphonso  You are not to consider that as anything extraordinary  answered he  the tragedy now about to be produced is from the pen of Don Gabriel Triaquero  the most fashionable dramatic writer of his day  Whenever the play bill announces any novelty from this favourite author  the whole town of Valencia is in a bustle  The men as well as the women talk incessantly on the subject of the piece  all the boxes are taken  and  on the first night of performance  there is a risk of broken limbs in getting in  though the price of admission is doubled  with the exception of the pit  which is too authoritative a part of the house for the proprietors to tamper with its patience  What a paroxysm of partiality  said I to the governor  This eager curiosity of the public  this hot headed impatience to be present at the first representation of Don Gabriel s pieces  gives me a magnificent idea of that poet s genius   At this period of our conversation the curtain rose  We immediately left off talking  to fix our whole attention on the stage  The applauses were rapturous even at the prologue  as the performance advanced  every sentiment and situation  nay  almost every line of the piece called forth a burst of acclamation  and at the end of each act the clapping of hands was so loud and incessant  as almost to bring the building about our ears  After the dropping of the curtain  the author was pointed out to me  going about from box to box  and with all the modesty of a successful poet  submitting his head to the imposition of those laurels  which the genteeler  and especially the fairer part of the audience had prepared for his coronation   We returned to the governor s palace  where we were met by a party of three or four gentlemen  Besides these mere amateurs  there were two veteran authors of considerable eminence in their line  and a gentleman of Madrid with tolerably fair claims to critical authority and judgment They had all been at the play  The new piece was the only topic of conversation during supper  time  Gentlemen  said a knight of St James  what do you think of this tragedy  Has it not every claim to the character of a finished work  Thoughts that breathe  and words that burn  a hand to touch the true chords of pity  and sweep the lyre of poetry  requisites how rarely  and yet how admirably united  In a word  it is the performance of a person mixing in the higher circles of society  There can be no
