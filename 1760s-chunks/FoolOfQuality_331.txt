earl      I knew  exclaimed Tom Truck  with a shout and look of triumph    I knew it could be no other but my brave and noble young master   who did the feat  On my life  cried Farmer Felster  he is able   with his naked arm  like another young David  to save his lambs   from the jaws of the lion and the paws of the bear      Though these praises served only to put our hero to confusion    they went trickling  like balm of Gilead  to the heart of his father    Pelt  said the earl  let it be your task to flay and tan me the hide   of your own dog  I will have his skin stuffed with incense  and   his nails of solid gold  and he shall hang up in my hall from   generation to generation  to commemorate the piety and prowess   of my son  Mean while  my good friends  I invite you all  with   your families  kinsfolk  and neighbours  to come and feast with me   this day  Sorrow hath endured her night   but joy cometh with   my child  and ariseth on us as a new morning       In the afternoon all the townsfolk and neighbours  with their   wives and children  convened to the great house  having their   cattle and themselves heavy laden with fagots for a magnificent   illumination  The whole court was spread with tables  and the   tables with victuals and liquors   besides two hogsheads of October   that stood apart      The earl  in the joy of his own escape  and the recent prowess   of his young hero  went forth with a cheerful countenance  and   graciously welcomed all his guests   whereat they wished health   and long life to his lordship and their young lord  and  giving a   joint huzza  sat down to their banquet  From whence  after a   night far spent in carousal  their great fire being out  and their   great hogsheads exhausted  they peacefully helped each other to   their respective homes   regretting  however  that they had not   been honoured with the presence of their young master among   them   for Harry had besought his father to dispense with him yet   a while from partaking in any part or scene of festivity  especially   when appointed in his own honour  and Mr  Meekly highly   approved and applauded his motion      On the eve of the following day  Mr  Meekly rode abroad on a   charitable visit to a dying man in the neighbourhood  and my   lord was fondly toying and patting the cheek of his darling  as   they stood at the hall door  when Harry spied a mourning coach   turning up the lower end of the great avenue  and instantly   cried out There s my uncle  my lord   my uncle   my dearest   uncle   and off he shot like lightning  The coach drove but   slowly   Harry was up with it in a twinkling  and  vaulting in at   the window  was in an instant in the bosom of his best friend   and patron      In the mean time the earl had retired into the house in great   agitation  He feared and was jealous of the manner in which his   brother would meet him  and this gave him equal doubt and   hesitation respecting the manner in which he ought to receive his   brother  Mr  Clinton  on the other hand  was not wholly without   some similar emotions   so that  when Harry introduced his uncle         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  365     into the parlour  no two noble personages could salute each other   with a more distant respect      The earl  however  on casting a glance upon the face of his   brother  felt a tide of returning affection  and  lifting up his hands   and eyes  exclaimed It is he  it is he  my Harry  my Harry   Clinton   my dear  my long lost  my long sought brother   then   hastened forward in a gush of passion  and caught him in his eager   arms   when Mr  Clinton  alternately folding the earl to his bosom    cried I am content  O my God   give me now to depart in peace    since at last I find and feel that I have indeed a brother       Our hero  observing the violence of their emotion  interposed   with a gentle care  and  supporting them to seats  placed them   tenderly by each other      For a while they both sat silent  with a handkerchief at their   eyes  till
