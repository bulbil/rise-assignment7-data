you will restore her to her parents    and give her 100L  or so  to make her happy in some honest fellow of her   own degree  and that will be doing something  and will also oblige and   pacify                                               Your much grieved sister         If I have written too sharply  consider it is my love to you  and   the shame you are bringing upon yourself  and I wish this may have the   effect upon you  intended by your very loving sister           This is a sad letter  my dear father and mother  and one may see how   poor people are despised by the proud and the rich  and yet we were   all on a foot originally  And many of these gentry  that brag of their   ancient blood  would be glad to have it as wholesome  and as really   untainted  as ours   Surely these proud people never think what a short   stage life is  and that  with all their vanity  a time is coming  when   they shall be obliged to submit to be on a level with us  And true said   the philosopher  when he looked upon the skull of a king  and that of a   poor man  that he saw no difference between them  Besides  do they not   know  that the richest of princes  and the poorest of beggars  are   to have one great and tremendous judge  at the last day  who will   not distinguish between them  according to their circumstances in   life   But  on the contrary  may make their condemnations the greater    as their neglected opportunities were the greater  Poor souls  how do I   pity their pride   O keep me  Heaven  from their high condition  if my   mind shall ever be tainted with their vice  or polluted with so cruel   and inconsiderate a contempt of the humble estate which they behold with   so much scorn       But  besides  how do these gentry know  that  supposing they could trace   back their ancestry for one  two  three  or even five hundred years    that then the original stems of these poor families  though they have   not kept such elaborate records of their good for nothingness  as   it often proves  were not still deeper rooted   And how can they   be assured  that one hundred years hence  or two  some of those now   despised upstart families may not revel in their estates  while their   descendants may be reduced to the others  dunghills   And  perhaps  such   is the vanity  as well as changeableness  of human estates  in their   turns set up for pride of family  and despise the others       These reflections occurred to my thoughts  made serious by my master s   indisposition  and this proud letter of the lowly Lady Davers  against   the high minded Pamela  Lowly  I say  because she could stoop to such   vain pride  and high minded I  because I hope I am too proud ever to do   the like   But  after all  poor wretches that we be  we scarce know what   we are  much less what we shall be   But  once more pray I to be kept   from the sinful pride of a high estate       On this occasion I recall the following lines  which I have read  where   the poet argues in a much better manner                          Wise Providence        Does various parts for various minds dispense         The meanest slaves  or those who hedge and ditch         Are useful  by their sweat  to feed the rich         The rich  in due return  impart their store         Which comfortably feeds the lab ring poor         Nor let the rich the lowest slave disdain         He s equally a link of Nature s chain         Labours to the same end  joins in one view         And both alike the will divine pursue         And  at the last  are levell d  king and slave         Without distinction  in the silent grave
