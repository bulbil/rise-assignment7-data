of his bad conduct  he died at Shene in Surry  deserted by all  even by those who had formerly grown rich by his bounty  Richard II  son of the Black Prince  was constituted his successor    138 and came to govern a discontented people  a rapacious ministry  and an impoverished state  These were the calamities consequent upon the errors of the preceding reign  Edward III  escaped them  but they fell heavily upon Richard  his successor   I am   c   LETTER XX   Dear Charles   THE faults of conquerors  as I have already observed  generally fall upon their successors  Richard II  came to the throne of his grandfather  when yet but eleven  and found the people discontented  and poor  The gentry were  in fact  luxurious  a spirit of profusion had entered with the spirit of gallantry  this necessarily produced indolence and rapacity among the higher orders of the kingdom  and their wants must necessarily produce an oppression of the rest   The regents  however  appointed during the King s minority  seemed no way sollicitous to appease these murmurings  The Duke of Lancaster  better known by the name of John of Ghaunt  in the very beginning  disgusted the people  by robbing two Knights of a prisoner  which they had taken in war  and  at the same time  several expeditions against the French and Scotch happened to be carried on without success  But a new engagement  entered into by the crown  of assisting Portugal  at a time when the government was insulted by nearer enemies  raised the people s indignation  To support this unnecessary alliance  a subsidy was to be levied by a poll tax  payable   139 by all above the age of fifteen  this  at last  raised the people s refentment into an insurrection   Notwithstanding the numbers  who by war  by a residence in towns  and by other means  had become free  yet there were still multitudes in the country who had lands in villenage  that  as yet  were only slaves to their lords from whom they held  These men had seen the charms of liberty  from its effects upon others  and they panted for freedom themselves  The luxury and opulence which they saw others enjoy  but for which they toiled  became an incentive to them to struggle for liberty also  Several of these had become opulent enough to purchase their freedom  but  by an unjust act of parliament  those purchases were declared of no validity  This the peasants considered as an infraction of the laws of humanity  and such  indeed  it actually was  A parliament of lords  and rich commoners  in this instance  feemed to have no regard for the rights of men whom they considered as slaves  as if some orders of mankind were held even too vile to find justice  The minds of the people were  therefore  thus prepared for sedition  when the manner of collecting the polltax provoked them to open revolt   We have  in preceding reigns  perceived popular insurrections only in the towns  we now find the spirit of seditious liberty spreading into the country  Citizens  at first  begin to perceive their own strength  and next the same manner of thinking is embraced by the peasant  whom the severity of the laws had annexed to the soil  We now begin to find a knowledge of the rights of humanity diffused even to the very lowest of the people  and exerting itself in rude and terrible efforts for freedom     140 The present insurrection began in Essex  where a report was industriously spread  implying  that the peasants were doomed to death  that their houses would be burned  and their farms plundered  The country people  alarmed at this intelligence  rose in their own defence  and  their numbers continually increasing  they advanced near London  to the number of an hundred thousand  with banners displayed  At the head of this undisciplined concourse was one Walter  by trade a tyler  he was one of those hardy spirits so frequently found among the common English  ready to face any danger  and support every calamity  in exacting the poll tax he had refused to pay for his daughter  alledging  that she was under the age mentioned in the act of parliament  The brutal collector insisted upon her being a full grown woman  and  in order to ascertain his assertions  proceeded to acts of indecency  this provoked the father to such a degree  that he struck him dead at one blow with his hammer  Wat Tyler was therefore considered as a champion in the cause  and appointed spokesman to the people  It is easy to imagine the disorders committed by such a tumultuous assembly  they burned and pillaged whereever they came  and revenged their former miseries upon their masters  the gentry  to whom they no longer acknowledged subjection  After having entered the Tower  and murdered such as they regarded as enemies  they divided themselves into bodies  and took up their quarters in different parts of the environs of the city  At length  Richard  riding towards Smithfield  invited them to a conference  in order to know and remove their grievances  Wat Tyler just entered Smithfield
