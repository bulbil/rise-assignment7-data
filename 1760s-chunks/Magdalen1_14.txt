for that purpose  rendered me doubly in need of consolation myself  All this time I was totally ignorant of what occasioned the unhappy girl s distress  and I tortured my imagination   82 incessantly  with endeavouring to think upon some probable cause—But judge  lady Haversham  of my distraction  when the poor deluded creature  struck with the anguish into which she saw us plunged  seized the first opportunity that her perfect recovery to reason supplied  of informing me that she was totally unworthy of the least regard  that she had fatally sacrificed the honour of her family  that Sir Robert Harold was irrecoverably lost  and that death was the only thing which could possibly put a period to her afflictions  In short  the keeness of her sensibility would not allow her to keep any thing concealed  she let me into the whole story of her guilty intercourse with your brother—and the agonies into which the horrid discovery naturally threw me  sweeping away every trace of her recollection  she made no scruple  in the fullness of her soul  to mention the cause of my   83 agitation to her father  upbraiding herself at the same time as the worst of parricides  who had not only shortened my days  but murdered my reputation   You know my  dear lady Haversham  how rigidly refined my poor Mr  Mildmay is in every thing which concerns the female delicacy of his family  You know he can scarcely allow for the most casual infirmities of human nature in a woman  though he preposterously thinks the other sex is entitled to the most unlimited indulgence—All his pity  therefore  for his miserable daughter  was instantly turned into an extravagant rage—he spurned the wretched girl as she lay at his feet  lamenting her fatal indiscretion  in language that would pierce a heart of adamant  and imploring his forgiveness with all the forcible rhetoric of streaming eyes  a bursting bosom  and a prostrate supplication  In vain did   84 I kneel with my child   for  O lady Haversham  notwithstanding the greatness of her crime  I cannot drive the mother from my heart   and conjure him  by whatever I thought most affecting  to pity her  the more earnest we were in our solicitation  the more inexorable he became in his resentment  till at last  worked up to a phrensy of indignation  he poured out a most barbarous execration on her  and commanded me  in a tone which I never presumed to dispute  to see the infamous strumpet  that was his cruel word  turned out of the house in less than an hour  as I either valued his repose  or my own tranquility  My own tranquility  lady Haversham—Alas  I shall never know a moment s happiness more —My peace of mind is eternally destroyed  and  so long as I retain the sense of feeling  I must be tremblingly alive to the united wounds both of misfortune and disgrace     85Mr  Mildmay  after pronouncing this sentence on his lost unhappy daughter  flew out of the room  though it was past twelve o clock at night  though the season was remarkably severe  and though a most violent storm of wind and rain was at that very moment abroad—Nothing could induce him to delay the execution of his commands till morning—Utterly deaf to my remonstrances  he insisted upon exposing her to all the fury of the elements  and it was with the utmost difficulty that I prevailed upon him  at last  to let the chariot take her to farmer Wilson s  at the end of the avenue  in fact  as well as all parental feeling  he seemed to put off all common humanity  and to rejoice at the horror of the night in which she was to be driven out  though  but half an hour before  he would have shuddered    —Lest the winds of Heaven  Should visit her face too roughly—    86 O lady Haversham  how happy are you in a want of children—You have a thousand times lamented in my hearing that you never had a child—Yet  was it possible for you to imagine but the smallest part of my distress  you would own the kindness of Providence was never more manifested than in the refusal of what you think a blessing  and what I experience to be the greatest of all misfortunes —But to go on     The severity which Mr  Mildmay thus relentlessly exercised on his miserable child  in a great measure  subdued the resentment which I myself should otherwise have entertained against her  I could not therefore resist the most ample indulgence of maternal tenderness  when the moment of separation came on  I pressed her to my heart with as much cordiality as if she had never offended  and entirely forgot the nature of her   87 fault  in the apprehension of never seeing her again  The poor girl was quite unable to support herself against what she called an excess of goodness—she fell repeatedly on her knees to kiss my hands  drenched them with her tears  and departed  leaning on the arm of her Sally  with a desire that I would forget there ever had been such a creature as herself  and a request that I would transfer all the affection which she had so shamefully disgraced  to the advancement of her brother s happiness  and the
