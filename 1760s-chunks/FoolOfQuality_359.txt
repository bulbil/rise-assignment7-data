their hearts      My lord  says Jacome at last  I am not the only one that remains   of your old servants  Your Gerard  too  who  blessings on his   hands  once tied me neck and heels Gerard  too  is forthcoming    and near at hand  Your honour s wonderful bounty made a   gentleman of him at once  and he is now in a high way  with a   wife and three children  A hundred and a hundred times have   we washed your remembrance with our tears   and indeed I think   your honour ought not to send for him  lest he should suddenly   die  or run distracted at your sight      In the mean time one of the lackeys had officiously gone and   informed Gerard of the arrival of his patron  He came panting    and rushed forward  as it were  to cast himself at the feet of his   lord   but stopping suddenly  and drawing back some steps  he   nailed his eyes  as it were  on the face of Mr  Clinton  and    spreading his hands  cried You live  then  my lord  you still   live  my dearest master   You survive all your deaths and suffer    ings  and the weight of ten mountains has not been able to crush   you  O the times the times  my master  never more to return    Will there be such times in heaven  think you  Will there be   such angels there as we once lived with upon earth       Here he clapped his hands together  and set up such a shout of   bitter lamentation as was enough to split the heart of every   hearer  and in a manner to split the graves of the persons whom   he deplored      As soon as Mr  Clinton and his two old friends had parted for   the night Tell me  my dear sir  said Harry  are there different   kinds of grief  or is it merely that grief affects us in different   manners      When I wept for my dear father  my mother  and brother  my   affliction was anguishing and altogether bitter  without any species   of alleviating sensation to compensate my misery  But it was far   otherwise with me to night  When I grieved in the grief of your   old and faithful domestics  I felt my heart breaking  but I was   pleased that it should break   I felt that it was my happiness so to   grieve  and I could wish a return of the same sweet sensations      The reason is this  my love   When you lamented your parents    you lamented yourself in your private and personal losses   your   affliction was just  it was natural  it was laudable   but still it wag         THE FOOL OF QUALITY          399         confined   it participated but little of the emotion that is excited   by the affliction of others   and the anguish was the keener by   being nearly limited to your own bosom  and your own concerns      But in the griefs of my old and loving servants this night  you   became wholly expanded  you went beyond  you went out of   yourself  you felt  without reflection  how delightful it is to go   forth with your God  in his social  generous  noble  and divine   sensibilities  and you delightfully felt  my Harry  that such a   house of mourning is more joyous to your soul  than all the festivals   that flesh and sense can open before you      And now  my child  I will finally and once for all lay open the   very horrible and detestable nature of Self in your soul      Self appears to us as the whole of our existence   as the sum  total   of all in which we are interested or concerned  It is as a Narcis    sus  self delighted  self enamoured  It desires  it craves  and   claims as its right  the loves  attachments  and respects of all   mankind  But does it acquire them  my Harry   O never  never     Self never was beloved  never will be beloved  never was honour    able or respectable in the eye of any creature  And the characters   of the patriot  the hero  the friend  and the lover  are only so far   amiable  so far reverable  as they are supposed to have gone   forth from the confines of self      As Mr  Clinton proposed to wait the return of the marquis  he   employed
