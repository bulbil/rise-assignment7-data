by her right side —take that opportunity to recollect that the organs and faculties of perception  can  by nothing in this world  be so aptly typified and explained as by that one thing whichDolly s hand is in search of —Your organs are not so dull that I should inform you — tis an inch  Sir  of red seal wax   When this is melted and dropped upon the letter  if Dolly fumbles too long for her thimble  till the wax is over harden d  it will not receive the mark of her thimble from the usual impulse which was wont to imprint it  Very well  If Dolly s wax  for want of better  is bees wax  or of a temper too soft —tho  it may receive —it will not hold the impression     how hard soever Dolly thrusts against it  and last of all  supposing the wax good  and eke the thimble  but applied thereto in careless haste  as her Mistress rings the bell —in any one of these three cases  the print  left by the thimble  will be as unlike the prototype as a brassjack   Now you must understand that not one of these was the true cause of the confusion in my uncle Toby s discourse  and it is for that very reason I enlarge upon them so long  after the manner of great physiologists —to shew the world what it did not arise from   What it did arise from  I have hinted above  and a fertile source of obscurity it is —and ever will be —and that is the unsteady uses of words which have perplexed    the clearest and most exalted understandings   It is ten to one  at Arthur s  whether you have ever read the literary histories of past ages —if you have —what terrible battles   yclept logomachies  have they occasioned and perpetuated with so much gall and ink shed —that a good natured man cannot read the accounts of them without tears in his eyes   Gentle critick  when thou hast weigh d all this  and consider d within thyself how much of thy own knowledge  discourse  and conversation has been pestered and disordered  at one time or other  by this  and this only —What a pudder and racket in COUNCILS about 〈 in non Latin alphabet 〉 and 〈 in non Latin alphabet 〉  and in the SCHOOLS of the learned about power and about spirit —about    essences  and about quintessences —about substances  and about space —What confusion in greater THEATRES from words of little meaning  and as indeterminate a sense —when thou considers this  thou wilt not wonder at my uncle Toby s perplexities —thou wilt drop a tear of pity upon his scarp and his counterscarp —his glacis and his covered way —his ravelin and his half moon   Twas not by ideas —by heaven  his life was put in jeopardy by words   CHAP  III   WHEN my uncle Toby got his map of Namur to his mind  he began immediately to apply himself  and with the utmost diligence  to the study of it  for nothing being of more importance    to him than his recovery  and his recovery depending  as you have read  upon the passions and affections of his mind  it behoved him to take the nicest care to make himself so far master of his subject  as to be able to talk upon it without emotion   In a fortnight s close and painful application  which  by the bye  did my uncle Toby s wound  upon his groin  no good —he was enabled  by the help of some marginal documents at the feet of the elephant  together with Gobesius s military architecture and pyroballogy  translated from the Flemish to form his discourse with passable perspicuity  and before he was two full months gone —he was right eloquent upon it  and could make not only the attack of the advanced    counterscarp with great order —but having  by that time  gone much deeper into the art  than what his first motive made necessary —my uncle Tobywas able to cross the Maes and Sambre  make diversions as far as Vauban s line  the abbey of Salsines   c  and give his visiters as distinct a history of each of their attacks  as of that of the gate of St  Nicolas  where he had the honour to receive his wound   But the desire of knowledge  like the thirst of riches  increases ever with the acquisition of it  The more my uncle Toby pored over his map  the more he took a liking to it —by the same process and electrical assimilation  as I told you  thro  which I ween the souls of connoisseurs themselves  by long friction and incumbition  have the happiness  at length  to    get all be virtu d —be pictur d —be butterflied  and be fiddled   The more my uncle Toby drank of this sweet fountain of science  the greater was the heat and impatience of his thirst  so that  before the first year of his confinement had well gone round  there was scarce a fortified town in Italy or Flanders  of which  by one means or other  he had not procured a plan  reading over as he got them  and
