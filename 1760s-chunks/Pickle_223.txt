 With this view  I begged that Lord W   would think  of some remote place in the country  to which we might retire for the  present  and he forthwith conducted me to a house on Blackheath  where  we were very civilly received by a laughter loving dame  who seemed  to mistake me for one of her own sisterhood  I no sooner perceived her  opinion  than I desired Lord W   to undeceive her  upon which she was  made acquainted with the nature of my situation  and showed us into a  private room  where I called for pen and paper  and wrote an apology  to my father  for having acted contrary to his will in so important a  concern     6 22 15  3 45 PM    This task being performed  the bridegroom gave me to understand  that  there was a necessity for our being bedded immediately  in order to  render the marriage binding  lest my father should discover and part  us before consummation  I pleaded hard for a respite till the evening   objecting to the indecency of going to bed before noon  but he found  means to invalidate all my arguments  and to convince me that it was now  my duty to obey  Rather than hazard the imputation of being obstinate  and refractory on the first day of my probation  I suffered myself to be  led into a chamber  which was darkened by my express stipulation  that  my shame and confusion might be the better concealed  and yielded to the  privilege of a dear husband  who loved me to adoration    About five o clock in the afternoon we were called to dinner  which we  had ordered to be ready at four  but such a paltry care had been forgot  amidst the transports of our mutual bliss  We got up  however  and when  we came downstairs  I was ashamed to see the light of day  or meet the  eyes of my beloved lord  I ate little  said less  was happy  though  overwhelmed with confusion  underwent a thousand agitations  some of  which were painful  but by far the greater part belonged to rapture and  delight  we were imparadised in the gratification of our mutual wishes   and felt all that love can bestow  and sensibility enjoy    In the twilight we returned to Lord W   s lodgings in town  where I  received a letter from my father  importing that he would never see me  again  But there was one circumstance in his manner of writing  from  which I conceived a happy presage of his future indulgence  He had  begun with his usual appellation of  Dear Fanny   which  though it was  expunged to make way for the word  Madam   encouraged me to hope that  his paternal fondness was not yet extinguished    At supper we were visited by Lord W   s younger sister  who laughed  at us for our inconsiderate match  though she owned she envied our  happiness  and offered me the use of her clothes until I could retrieve  my own  She was a woman of a great deal of humour  plain but genteel   civil  friendly  and perfectly well bred  She favoured us with her  company till the night was pretty far advanced  and did not take her  leave till we retired to our apartment    As our lodgings were not spacious or magnificent  we resolved to see  little company  but this resolution was frustrated by the numerous  acquaintance of Lord W    who let in half the town  so that I ran the  gauntlet for a whole week among a set of wits  who always delight in  teasing a young creature of any note  when she happens to make such  a stolen match  Among those that visited us upon this occasion was my  lord s younger brother  who was at that time in keeping with a rich  heiress of masculine memory  and took that opportunity of making  a parade with his equipage  which was indeed very magnificent  but  altogether disregarded by us  whose happiness consisted in the opulence  of mutual love    This ceremony of receiving visits being performed  we went to wait on  his mother  the duchess of H    who  hearing I was an heiress  readily  forgave her son for marrying without her knowledge and consent  and  favoured us with a very cordial reception  insomuch  that for several  months  we dined almost constantly at her table  and I must own  I  always found her unaltered in her civility and affection  contrary    6 22 15  3 45 PM   to her general character  which was haughty and capricious  She was  undoubtedly a woman of great spirit and understanding  but subject to  an infirmity which very much impairs and disguises every other  qualification    In about three weeks after our marriage  I was so happy as to obtain  the forgiveness of my father  to whose house we repaired  in order  to pay our respects and
