and of my ancestors —I rave—but no wonder—I am mad upon this subject —But to return  I then recollected  that the day before I set out for Sidney Castle  I received a message from Mrs Gerrarde in the morning  desiring my company to drink coffee with her that evening  I obeyed the summons  little expecting to meet Mrs Arnold at her house  whom I had never seen there before  The effect my presence had on her extremely surprized me  she presently quitted the room  Mrs Gerrarde took that opportunity of telling me  that she had dropped in on her very unexpectedly  but  as she    supposed she would go directly away  we should have an hour to chat by ourselves  She then followed your sister out  and I remained alone in the parlour  Whilst I was reflecting on this odd encounter  which I did not then imagine had been brought about by design  Mrs Gerrarde came in to me  saying  your sister was so ill she was under a necessity of accompanying her home  and had ordered her chariot for that purpose  she made an apology for being obliged to leave me  and said she should be glad to see me the next day  I took my leave  and in going out saw Mr Arnold at the door  which I judged was the true reason of Mrs Gerrarde’s dismissing me   I set out for Wiltshire the next morning  and though there was something odd in the whole of this incident  I believed it was owing to chance alone  and thought no more of it  till  upon my Lord V——’s telling me the true cause of your sister’s disgrace  I found that this serpent had laid the whole plan on purpose to destroy her  You see  for to be sure you know all the particulars  how she seduced the innocent Mrs Arnold into this fatal visit  having first engaged me to come at the very point of time when she knew the husband would surprize us  for his coming  you may be satisfied  was not unexpected   I own to you  Sir George  in the first motions of my rage  I could have stabbed Arnold  Mrs Gerrarde  and myself  but my Lord V—— calmed my transports  by telling me  that it was your sister’s earnest request that this detestable secret should be kept from my knowlege  and that Lady V——  who had intrusted him with it  would never forgive him  if she knew he had divulged it  This reflection brought me back to my senses  and I burned with impatience to execute my first plan  which Mrs Gerrarde’s repeated crimes now called upon me to accelerate  I communicated my design to Lord V——  who was delighted with it  for he perfectly adores your sister  This  said he  though not such a vengeance as that wicked woman deserves  must in the end be productive of what you wish  and Mrs Arnold may be restored to her peace  without injury to her character  or mischief to any body   Having settled my measures with Lord V——  I went to pay a visit to Mrs Gerrarde  The cockatrice affected to speak with surprize and concern of your sister’s separation from her husband  I asked her  had she  who was so intimate with both  heard any reason assigned for it  She shook her head  and by a pretended sorrow in her looks  and a mysterious silence  invited me to press for an explanation of her meaning  She told me at length  with a seeming reluctance  that    ‘poor Mrs Arnold  though to be sure she was a sensible woman  was not without the little frailties and passions of her sex  and that  astonishing and groundless as her suspicions were  she had taken it into her head to be jealous of Mr Arnold  and with whom do you think  of all people  she suspects him ’ I cannot imagine  said I  Why truly with me  replied the undaunted Jezebel  and looked as if she expected I should be as much amazed as she pretended to be  I affected to laugh at it  and changing the discourse  put an end to my visit   The measures I had to observe required some management  It would not answer the full extent of my purpose to rob Mr Arnold of his dear  if it did not appear at the same time that she had left him with her own consent  To bring about this  it was necessary that the flight on her part should seem premeditated  which would not carry any face  unless she took with her such of her moveables as were most valuable  This I knew could not be done without the assistance of her maid  whom I therefore not only resolved to trust  but also to make her a partner in her mistress’s elopement   Having settled thus much of the plan in my own mind  I began my operations  by making the maid presents every time I visited the mistress  and I took care to give those visits as much the air of an amour as I possibly could  I dare swear the girl thought Mrs Gerrarde and I were upon the best terms imaginable  I affected to come at such hours as I was sure Mrs Gerrarde
