have no hopes to give him  He said  he would not presume to mention his love to my mother  though Lady Grimston pressed him to it  it was like her   till he had first declared himself to me  This was not indelicate  my heart thanked him for it  though I only returned him a bow  We were seasonably  to me at least  interrupted here  by the arrival of my friend the dean  He had come to see lady Grimston  just as Mr Arnold had entered into conversation with me  the old gentleman had a mind to walk in the garden  the little drawing room  where we were  opened into it  by a glass door  so that lady Grimston and my mother were obliged to bring him that way  Though I was glad that the conversation was broke off  yet I could have wished that I had first had an opportunity of throwing a little cold water on Mr Arnold’s hopes  lest he should have put too favourable an interpretation on the reception I gave him  and mention the thing to my mother  before I had time to speak to her   I was in some confusion at their entering the room  Mr Arnold had at that time laid hold of one of my hands  and I had but just time to withdraw it  when the door flew open to give entrance to the two ladies and the good man  the latter lifting up both his hands  as if conscious of having done something wrong  with a good humoured freedom  asked pardon  but with a look that seemed to indicate  he thought the apology necessary both to Mr Arnold and me  This disconcerted me more  my mother smiled  and lady Grimston drew up her long neck  and winked at the dean  I took up my hat  that lay in a window  without well knowing what I did  and said  I would wait on them into the garden  Mr Arnold followed my example  but looked at me  I do not know how—impertinently—as if he thought I did not dislike him  I took one turn with them  and then slipped away  under pretence of going in to dress  I ran directly into Mrs Vere’s room  and told her what had passed between Mr Arnold and me  She laughed  and said  she could have told me long ago it would have come to that  I knew Mr Arnold admired you  said she  the first time I saw you in his company  he is no contemptible conquest I can tell you  He assured my mother  that you were the only woman he ever saw in his life that had made an impression on him  and I am inclined to believe him  for he is not a man of an amorous complexion  nor did I ever hear of his making his addresses to any one  though he might have his choice of the best fortunes  and the best families in the country  for the ladies  I must inform you  admire him exceedingly  and when you are known to be his choice  you will be the envy of all the young women in the country  I sighed   I don’t know why  and said  I desired not to create envy on that account  Mrs Vere said  why really Miss Bidulph  if your heart is at liberty  I know of no man more worthy of it than Mr Arnold  but perhaps  looking with a kind earnestness on me  that may not be your case  I told her  my heart was not engaged  as it really is not  for indeed  Cecilia  I do    not think of Mr Faulkland   but that I did not find in myself any great inclination towards Mr Arnold  Oh  my dear  said she  if you find no disinclination  it is enough  I married for love  yet I was far from being happy  The vexation that I occasioned in my own and my husband’s family  was a counter ballance to the satisfaction of possessing the man I loved  Mr Arnold  besides being very amiable in his person  has good sense  and good temper  and if you marry him with nothing more than indifference  gratitude will soon produce love in such a breast as yours  Were there anything like aversion in your heart  then indeed it would be criminal in you to accept of him   Mrs Vere delivered her sentiments with such a calm sweetness  such a disinterested sincerity  that what she said made an impression on me  We are apt  contrary as it may seem to reason  to be more wrought upon by the opinion and advice of young people like ourselves  than by that of persons  whose experience certainly gives them a better right to form judgments  but we have a sort of a natural repugnance to the being dictated to  even by those who have an authority to do it  and as age gives a superiority  every thing that comes from it carries a sort of air of prescribing  which we are wonderfully inclined to reject   Had lady Grimston said this to me  it would have put me upon my guard  as suspecting a design on my liberty of choice  Even my good mother
