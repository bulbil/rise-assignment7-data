the enemy upon more equal terms than ever  often victorious    245 sometimes repulsed  but ever active and formidable  To name his victories  the towns he took  the dangers he escaped  and the losses he suffered  would take up more time than I would chuse to grant to such accounts  or you should bestow  Never was the art of war carried to such a pitch as by him  In this war Europe saw  with astonishment  campaigns carried on in the midst of winter  great and bloody battles fought  yet producing no visible advantage to the victors  At no time  since the days of heroism  were such numbers destroyed  so many towns taken  so many skirmishes fought  such stratagems practised  or such intrepidity shewn  Armies now were considered as composing one single machine  directed by the General  and animated with one will  From the commentary of these campaigns  succeeding Generals will take their lessons for devastation  and improve in the arts of increasing human calamity   England was  all this time  happily retired from the calamities which drenched the rest of Europe in blood  yet  from her natural military eagerness  seemed desirous of sharing those dangers of which she was only a spectator  This passion for carrying on a continental war  was not less pleasing to the Monarch from his native attachments  than to the people from their natural propensity to arms  As soon as it was known that Prince Ferdinand had put himself at the head of the Hanoverian army  his Britannic Majesty  in a speech at the opening of the session of parliament  observed  that the late successes in Germany had given an happy turn to his affairs  which it would be necessary to improve  The commons therefore granted liberal supplies both for the service of the King of Prussia  and for enabling the army formed in the Electorate of Hanover  to act vigorously in conjunction with him  Soon after it was considered  that men would be a more grateful   246 supply than money  The minister who had first come into power and popularity  by opposing such measures  was now prevailed upon to enter into them with even greater ardour than any of his predecessors  The hopes of putting a speedy end to this war  by vigorous measures  his connexions  and  perhaps  the pleasure he found in giving his Majesty pleasure  incited him eagerly into a continental war  It is certain  no minister could more powerfully second a warlike Monarch s intentions  that spirit of enterprize which had  in a measure  taken birth with his administration  he could now direct at will  The passion for military honour seemed diffused through all ranks of people  and it only wanted a channel in which to flow  In order to indulge this general inclination  the Duke of Marlborough was sent into Germany with a small body of British forces to assist Prince Ferdinand  where they behaved with bravery  and conspired in promoting that Prince s successes  Each victory they gained  however  only served as a pretext to call over new forces from Britain  while the English ministry were taught to believe that every last battle would be decisive  The battle of Crevelt was fought  in which the Hanoverians and English had the advantage  but it produced no effect  The victory of Minden followed  but laurels seemed to be all that England reaped from the conquered field  After these two victories it was supposed  that one reinforcement more of British forces would terminate the war in our favour  a reinforcement was therefore sent  The British troops in Germany now amounted to above thirty thousand men  yet no advantage of any consequence was the result of this formidable assistance  War was the trade of some Generals  and  it must be allowed  a gainful trade it was  Let me therefore  here again  pass over this continued repetition of marchings  skirmishes  and   247 rencounters  nor load the  with names of German Generals  too difficult to be pronounced by an English tongue  and equally grating to a patriot ear  The victories of either side might  in fact  be considered as a compact by which something was to be lost on either side  and no advantage to be acquired  The English  at length  began to open their eyes to their own interest  nor could all the splendours of victory so far blind them  as not to see that they were waging unequal war  and assuming new loads of taxes for conquests they could neither preserve nor enjoy  Such were the growing discontents of the people  when the King  who had inspired these measures  unexpectedly died  On the twenty fifth day of October  George II  without any previous disorder  was found by his domestic servants  expiring in his chamber  He had arisen at his usual hour  and observed to his attendants  that as the weather was fine  he would walk out  In a few minutes after this  being left alone  he was heard to fall down upon the floor  The noise of his fall brought his attendants into the room  who lifted him into bed  where he desired  in a faint voice  that the Princess Amelia might be sent for  but before her arrival he expired  George
