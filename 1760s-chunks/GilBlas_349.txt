 consisting in a forced regurgitation of ill gotten spoils from individuals who had made large fortunes  hell and their own consciences knew best how  in the superintendence of the royal expenditure  When he had squeezed these spunges till they were dry again  and had filled the king s coffers with the drainings  he undertook to render the reform permanent by abolishing all pensions  not excepting his own  and curtailing the gratuities too frequently bestowed on favourites out of the prince s privy purse  To succeed in this design  which he could not carry into effect without changing the face of the government  he charged me with the composition of a new state paper  furnishing the substance and the form from his own idea  He then advised me to raise my style as much as possible above the level of my ordinary simplicity  and to give an air of more eloquence to my phraseology  A hint is sufficient  my lord  said I  your excellency wishes to unite sublimity with illumination  and it shall be so I shut myself up in the same closet where I had already worked so successfully  and sat down stiffly to my task  first calling to my aid the lofty and clear perceptions  the noble and sonorous expressions  of my old instructor  the archbishop of Grenada   I began by laying it down as a first maxim of political philosophy  that the vital functions  the respiration as it were of all monarchy  depended on the strict administration of the finances  that in our particular case that duty became imperiously urgent  irresistibly impressing on our consciences  and that the revenue should be considered as the nerves and sinews of Spain  to hold her rivals in check and keep her enemies in awe  After this general declamation  I pointed out to the sovereign  for to him the memorial was addressed  that by cutting down all pensions and perquisites dependent on the ordinary income  he would not thereby deprive himself of that truly royal pleasure  a princely munificence towards those of his subjects who had established a fair claim to his favours  because without drawing upon his treasury  he had the means of distributing more acceptable rewards  that for one branch of service  there were viceroyalties  lieutenancies  orders of merit  and all sorts of military commissions  for another  high judicial situations with salaries annexed  civil offices of magistracy with sounding titles to give them consequence  and though last  not least  all the temporal possessions of the church to animate the piety of its spiritual pastors   This memorial  which was much longer than the first  occupied me nearly three days  but as luck would have it  my performance was exactly to my master s mind  who finding it written with sententious cogency  and bristled up with metaphors in the declamatory parts  complimented me in the highest terms That is vastly well expressed indeed  said he  laying his finger on a passage here and there  and picking out all the most inflated sentences he could find that language bears the stamp of fine composition  and might pass for the production of a classic  Courage  my friend  I foresee that your services will be worth their weight in gold  And yet  notwithstanding the applauses he lavished on my classical composition  a few of his own heightening touches  he thought  would make it read still better  He put a good deal of his own stuff into it  and the medley was manufactured into a piece of eloquence which was considered as unanswerable by the king and all the court  The whole city joined in opinion with the higher orders  deriving the most flattering hopes of the future from these grand promises  and concluding that the monarchy must re cover its pristine splendour during the ministry of so illustrious a character  His excellency  finding that my sermon on economy was fraught with practical inferences of utility to him  was kind enough to wish that I should profit by the exercise of my own talents  In conformity therefore with his new system of patronage  he gave me an annuity of five hundred crowns on the commandery of Castile  and the acceptance of it was so much the more palatable  as no dirty work had been done for it  but it was honestly  though cheaply  earned       CH  VII     Gil Blas meets with his friend Fabricio once more  the accident  place  and circumstances described  with the particulars of their conversation together   NOTHING gave his lordship greater pleasure than to hear the general decision of Madrid on the conduct of his administration  Not a day passed but he inquired what they were saying of him in the political world  He kept spies in pay  to bring him an exact account of what was going on in the city  They particularized the most trivial discourses which they overheard  and their orders being to suppress nothing  his self love was grazed now and then  for the people have a way of bolting out home truths  without any nice calculation where they may glance   Finding that the count loved political small talk  I made it my business to frequent places of public resort after dinner  and to chime in with the conversation of genteel people whenever opportunity offered  Should the measures of government happen to
