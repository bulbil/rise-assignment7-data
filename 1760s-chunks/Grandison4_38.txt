There they found another large company  My brother was all chearfulness  and both men and women seemed to contend for his notice  But they were much disappointed at finding he meant to leave them early in the evening   One married Lady  the wife of Sir—Somebody  I am very bad at remembring the names of cityknights  was resolved  she said  since they could not have Sir Charles to open the Ball  to have one dance before dinner with the handsomest man in England  The music was accordingly called in  and he made no scruple to oblige the company on a day so happy   Do you know  Harriet  that Sir Charles is supposed to be one of the finest dancers in England  Remember  my dear  that on Tuesday— Lord help me  I shall be then stupid  and remember nothing  you take him out yourself  And then you will judge for yourself of his excellence in this science—May we not call dancing a science  If we judge by the few who perform gracefully in it  I am sure we may  and a difficult one too   Sir Charles  it seems  so much delighted every body  that they would not be denied his dancing with the bride that was so lately Galliard  who was known to be a fine dancer  And when he had so done  he took out the other two brides in turn     95 O —And remember  Harriet  that you get somebody to call upon him to sing—You shall play—I believe I shall f•rget in that only agreeable moment of the day  for you have a sweet finger  my love  that I am the principal fool in the play of the evening   O Harriet I—how can I  in the circumstances I am in  write any more about these soft souls  and silly  Come to me  my love  by day dawn  and leave me not till—I don t know when  Come  and take my part  my dear  I shall hate this man  He does nothing but hop  skip  and dance about me  grin and make mouths  and every body upholds him in it  Must this  I hope not   be the last time that I write myself to you  CHARLOTTE GRANDISON   LETTER XIII  Miss BYRON  To Miss SELBY    St  James s Square  Friday Morn  April 7   SIR Charles Grandison set out early this morning for Lord W  s  in his way to Lady Mansfield s  I am here with this whimsical Charlotte   Lady L  Miss Jervois  myself  and every female of the family  or who do business for both sisters out of it  are busy in some way or other  preparatory to the approaching Tuesday   Miss Grandison is the only idle person  I tell her  she is affectedly so   The Earl has presented her  in his son s name  with some very rich trinkets  Very valuable jewels are also bespoke by Lord G  who takes Lady L  s advice in every thing  as one well read in the fashions  New equis are bespoke  and gay ones they will be   Miss Grandison confounded me this morning by an instance of her generosity  She was extremely urgent with me to accept  as her third sister  of her share of   96 her mother s jewels  You may believe  that I absolutely refused such a present  I was angry with her  and told her  she had but one way of making up with me  and that was  that since she would be so completely set out from her Lord  she would unite the two halves  by presenting hers to Lady L  who had refused jewels from her Lord on her marriage  and who then would make an appearance  occasionally  as brilliant as her own   She was pleased with the hint  and has actually given them  unknown to any body but me  to her jeweller  who is to dispose them in such figures  as shall answer those she herself is to have  which Lady L  has not  And by this contrivance  which will make them in a manner useless to herself  she thinks she shall oblige her sister  however reluctant  to accept of them   Lady Gertrude is also preparing some fine presents for her niece elect  But neither the delighted approbation of the family she is entering into  nor the satisfaction expressed by her own friends  give the perverse Charlotte any visible joy  nor procure for Lord G  the distinction which she ought to think of beginning to pay him  But  for his part  never was man so happy  He would  however  perhaps  fare better from her  if he could be more moderate in the outward expression of his joy  which she has taken it into her head to call an insult upon her   She does not  however  give the scope she did before the day was fix d  to her playful captiousness  She is not quite so arch as she was  Thoughtfulness  and a seeming carelessness of what we are all about for her  appear in her countenance  She saunters about  and affects to be diverted
