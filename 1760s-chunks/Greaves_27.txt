 When he was asked what was the matter  he said  he believed the devil had got in him  and he should never be his own man again    That same day the knight carried him to Ashenton  where he bespoke those accoutrements which he now wears  and while these were making  it was thought the poor fellow would have run distracted  He did nothing but growl  and curse and swear to himself  run backwards and forwards between his own hut and Greavesbury Hall  and quarrel with the horses in the stable  At length  his wife and family were removed into a snug farmhouse  that happened to be empty  and care taken that they should be comfortably maintained    These precautions being taken  the knight  one morning  at daybreak  mounted Bronzomarte  and Crabshaw  as his squire  ascended the back of a clumsy cart horse  called Gilbert  This  again  was looked upon as an instance of insanity in the said Crabshaw  for  of all the horses in the stable  Gilbert was the most stubborn and vicious  and had often like to have done mischief to Timothy while he drove the cart and plough  When he was out of humour  he would kick and plunge as if the devil was in him  He once thrust Crabshaw into the middle of a quick set hedge  where he was terribly torn  another time he canted him over his head into a quagmire  where he stuck with his heels up  and must have perished  if people had not been passing that way  a third time he seized him in the stable with his teeth by the rim of the belly  and swung him off the ground  to the great danger of his life  and I ll be hanged  if it was not owing to Gilbert  that Crabshaw was now thrown into the river    Thus mounted and accoutred  the knight and his squire set out on their first excursion  They turned off from the common highway  and travelled all that day without meeting anything worthy recounting  but  in the morning of the second day  they were favoured with an adventure  The hunt was upon a common through which they travelled  and the hounds were in full cry after a fox  when Crabshaw  prompted by his own mischievous disposition  and neglecting the order of his master  who called aloud to him to desist  rode up to the hounds  and crossed them at full gallop  The huntsman  who was not far off  running towards the squire  bestowed upon his head such a memento with his pole  as made the landscape dance before his eyes  and  in a twinkling he was surrounded by all the fox hunters  who plied their whips about his ears with infinite agility  Sir Launcelot  advancing at an easy pace  instead of assisting the disastrous squire  exhorted his adversaries to punish him severely for his insolence  and they were not slow in obeying this injunction  Crabshaw  finding himself in this disagreeable situation  and that there was no succour to be expected from his master  on whose prowess he had depended  grew desperate  and  clubbing his whip  laid about him with great fury  wheeling about Gilbert  who was not idle  for he  having received some of the favours intended for his rider  both bit with his teeth and kicked with his heels  and  at last  made his way through the ring that encircled him  though not before he had broke the huntsman s leg  lamed one of the best horses on the field  and killed half a score of the hounds    Crabshaw  seeing himself clear of the fray  did not tarry to take leave of his master  but made the most of his way to Greavesbury Hall  where he appeared hardly with any vestige of the human countenance  so much had he been defaced in this adventure  He did not fail to raise a great clamour against Sir Launcelot  whom he cursed as a coward in plain terms  swearing he would never serve him another day  But whether he altered his mind on cooler reflection  or was lectured by his wife  who well understood her own interest  he rose with the cock  and went again in quest of Sir Launcelot  whom he found on the eve of a very hazardous enterprise    In the midst of a lane  the knight happened to meet with a party of about forty recruits  commanded by a serjeant  a corporal  and a drummer  which last had his drum slung at his back  but seeing such a strange figure mounted on a high spirited horse  he was seized with an inclination to divert his company  With this view  he braced his drum  and  hanging it in its proper position  began to beat a point of war  advancing under the very nose of Bronzomarte  while the corporal exclaimed   D—n my eyes  who have we got here —old King Stephen  from the horse armoury in the Tower  or the fellow that rides armed at my Lord Mayor s show   The knight s steed seemed  at least  as well pleased with the sound of the drum  as were the recruits that followed it  and
