this cabinet of curiosities to that gallery of pictures  waste the prime of life in wonder  skilful in pictures  ignorant in men  yet impossible to be reclaimed  because their follies take shelter under the names of delicacy and taste   It is true  Painting should have due encouragement  as the painter can undoubtedly fit up our apartments in a much more elegant manner than the upholsterer  but I should think a man of fashion makes but an indifferent exchange  who lays out all that time in furnishing his house which   143 he should have employed in the furniture of his head  a person who shews no other symptoms of taste than his cabinet or gallery  might as well boast to me of the furniture of his kitchen   I know no other motive but vanity that induces the great to testify such an inordinate passion for pictures  after the piece is bought  and gazed at eight or ten days successively  the purchaser s pleasure must surely be over  all the satisfaction he can then have  is to shew it to others  he may be considered as the guardian of a treasure of which he makes no manner of use  his gallery is furnished not for himself  but the connoisseur  who is generally some humble flatterer  ready to feign a rapture he does not feel  and as necessary to the happiness of a picture buyer  as gazers are to the magnificence of an Asiatic procession   I have enclosed a letter from a youth of distinction  on his travels  to his father in England  in which he appears addicted to no vice  seems obedient to his governor  of a good natural disposition  and fond of improvement   but at the same time early taught to regard cabinets and galleries as the only proper schools of improvement  and to consider a skill in pictures as the properest knowledge for a man of quality    My lord   We have been but two days at Antwerp  wherefore I have sat down as soon as possible to give you some account of what we have seen since our arrival  desirous of letting no opportunity pass without writing to so good a father  Immediately upon alighting from our Rotterdam machine    144 my governor  who is immoderately fond of paintings  and at the same time an excellent judge  would let no time pass till we paid our respects to the church of the virgin mother  which contains treasure beyond estimation  We took an infinity of pains in knowing its exact dimensions  and differed half a foot in our calculation  so I leave that to some succeeding information  I really believe my governor and I could have lived and died there There is scarce a pillar in the whole church that is not adorned by a Reubens  a Vander Meuylen  a Vandyke  or a Woverman  What attitudes  carnations  and draperies  I am almost induced to pity the English who have none of those exquisite pieces among them  As we were willing to let slip no opportunity of doing business  we immediately after went to wait on Mr  Hogendorp  whom you have so frequently commended for his judicious collection  His cameas are indeed beyond price  his intaglio s not so good  He shewed us one of an officiating flamen  which he thought to be an antique  but my governor  who is not to be deceived in these particulars  soon found it to be an arrant cinque cento  I could not  however  sufficiently admire the genius of Mr  Hogendorp  who has been able to collect from all parts of the world a thousand things which no body knows the use of  Except your lordship and my governor  I do not know any body I admire so much  He is indeed a surprizing genius  The next morning early  as we were resolved to take the whole day before us  we sent our compliments to Mr  Van Sprokcken  desiring to see his gallery  which request he very politely complied with  His gallery measures fifty feet by twenty  and is well filled  but what surprized me most of all  was to see an   145 holy family just like your lordship s  which this ingenious gentleman assures me is the true original  I own this gave me inexpressible uneasiness  and I fear it will to your lordship  as I had flattered myself that the only original was in your lordship•s possession  I would advise you  however  to take yours down till its merit can be ascertained  my governor assuring me  that he intends to write a long dissertation to prove its originality  One might study in this city for ages  and still find something new  we went from this to view the cardinal s statues  which are really very fine  there were three spintria executed in a very masterly manner  all arm in arm  the torse which I heard you talk so much of  is at last discovered to be a Hercules spinning  and not a Cleopatra bathing  as your lordship had conjectured  there has been a treatise written to prove it   My lord Firmly is certainly a Goth  a Vandal  no taste in the world for painting  I wonder how any call him a man of taste  passing through the streets of Antwerp a few days ago
