him to fix on me as an adopted son  He was engaged as an attendant on a physician s lady  resident within thirty yards of our house  I went to him in the evening  when shop was shut  and we two  sitting on the threshold of the door  made up a little concert not displeasing to the neighbourhood  It was not that our voices were very fine  but in thrumming on the catgut  we made a pretty regular accompaniment to our duet  and filled up the harmony sufficiently for the gratification of our hearers  Our music was particularly agreeable to Donna Mergelina  the physician s wife  she came into the passage to hear us  and sometimes encored us in her favourite airs  Her husband did not interfere with her amusement  Though a Spaniard and in years  he was not possessed with jealousy  besides  his profession took up all his time  and as he came home in the evening  worn out with his numerous visits  he went to bed at an early hour  without troubling himself about his wife or our concerts  Possibly  if he thought about them at all  he might consider them as little likely to produce dangerous consequences  He had an additional security in his wife  Mergelina was young and handsome with a witness  but of so fierce a modesty  that she started at the very shadow of a man  How could he take umbrage at an amusement of so harmless and decorous a nature  He gave us leave to sing our hearts out   One evening  as I came to the physician s door  intending to take my usual recreation  I found the old squire waiting for me  He took me by the hand  saying that he wished to take a little walk with me before we struck up our little concert  At the same time he drew me aside into a by street  where  finding an opportunity of opening his mind  Diego  my good lad  said he with a melancholy air  I want to give you a hint in private  I much fear  my good and amiable youth  that we shall both have reason to repent of beguiling our evenings with little musical parties at my master s door  Rely on my sincere friendship  I do not grudge your lessons in singing and on the guitar  but if I could have foreseen the storm now brewing  in the name of charity  I would have selected some other spot to communicate my instructions  This address alarmed me  I entreated the gentle squire to be more explicit  and to tell me what we had to fear  for I was no Hector  and the tour of Spain was not yet finished  I will relate to you  replied he  what it concerns you to know  that you may take proper measure of our present danger   When I got into the service of the physician  about a year ago  he said one morning  after having introduced me to his wife  There  Marcos  you see your mistress  that is the lady you are to accompany in all her peregrinations  I was smitten with Donna Mergelina  she was lovely in the extreme  a model for an artist  and her principal attraction was the pleasantness of her deportment  Honoured sir  replied I to the physician  it is too great a happiness to be in the train of so charming a lady  My answer was taken amiss by Mergelina  who said rather crustily  A pleasant gentleman this  He is perfectly free and easy  Believe me  His fine speeches may go a begging for me  These words  dropped from such lovely lips  seemed rather inconsistent  the manners and ideas of bumpkins and dairy maids coupled with all the graces of the most lovely woman in the world  As for her husband  he was used to her ways  and  hugging himself on the unrivalled character of his rib  Marcos  said he  my wife is a miracle of chastity  Then  observing her put on her veil  and make herself ready to go to mass  he told me to attend on her at church  We were no sooner in the street than we met  and it was no wonder  blades who  struck with Donna Mergelina s genteel carriage  told her a thousand flattering tales as they passed by  She was not backward in her answers  but silly and ill timed  beyond what you can conceive  They were all in amaze  and could not imagine how a woman should take it amiss to be complimented  Why really  madam  said I to her at first  you had better be silent  or shut your ears to their addresses  than reply with asperity  No  no  replied she  I will teach these coxcombs that I am not a woman to put up with impertinence  In short  her absurdity went so far  that I could not help telling her my mind  at the hazard of her displeasure  I gave her to understand  yet with the greatest possible caution  that she was unjust to nature  whose handiwork she marred by her preposterous ferocity  that a woman of mild and polished manners might inspire love without the aid of beauty  whereas the loveliest of the sex
