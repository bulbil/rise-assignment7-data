her filial obedience  Ah  lady Grimston  thought I  by what I have heard of you  you did not seem to number obedience amongst wife like virtues in your own case  though you can preach it up to others  But I knew this sermon was chiefly intended for poor Mrs Vere’s use  My mother was all kindness and complacency  She seemed so delighted  that I rejoiced in having had it in my power to give her so much happiness  Lady Grimston did the honours of her house on this occasion with great magnificence  and I believe I need not tell you  with most exquisite decorum  Indeed this wedding was conducted with such a decent festivity  so rationally on all sides  and such a comfortable privacy  that I was not half so much shocked as I expected to have been   We have no company here besides the family of the house  my dear good old Dean  his lady and daughter  one young lady more  and a relation of Mr Arnold’s  a gentleman who came from London on purpose to be present on this  as it is called  joyful occasion   We shall leave this house to morrow  Mr Arnold and I  I mean  I am to be put into possession of the old mansion of Arnold abbey  My mother is to continue with lady Grimston a week or a fortnight longer  and then she goes to London on no other call  as she says  but to see and administer comfort to poor Miss B  who she supposes will be by that time come to her retreat   I believe I shall remain in the country while the weather continues pleasant  but am not yet determined   October 17  We took leave of lady Grimston this morning  or rather of her house  for her ladyship  my dear mother  and all the good folks that were our guests at Grimston hall  are to dine with us to day at Arnold abbey  I desired I might be permitted to go home without any parade  and in as private a manner as possible  for you know how I hate a bustle  Mr    Arnold very obligingly indulged me in this request  and conducted my sweet Mrs Vere and me home in his coach  at eight of the clock this morning  I found every thing in exact order at Arnold abbey  The house is very spacious and convenient  though very old fashioned  Some of the rooms  however  are newly fitted up  perfectly neat and handsome  The servants are orderly and well behaved  and every thing seems to be exactly well regulated  You may be sure I have taken my own Patty home with me  I intend to constitute her housekeeper  and give her an additional salary for her additional trouble  Mr Arnold had nobody in that capacity before  as his household had not been settled since the acquisition of his fortune  and he reserved the chusing of so material a domestic to me  but as I do not love to multiply servants  and know that Patty is very capable of the place  I shall take no other   October 21  Visitors still in abundance  all the gentry in the neighbourhood for some miles about have been to pay us their compliments  at least  I hope by this time they have all been here  for we have not had a minute to ourselves these three days  It will take me up ten to return them  as many of the families live at a good distance from hence   Mr Arnold  whose mourning has been laid aside since our wedding day  seems to have a very good taste in dress  he is perfectly well shaped  and appears to great advantage in colours  in short  he is more amiable than I thought he was  It is with great pleasure that I observe my young acquaintance  on whose heart I feared Mr Arnold had made an impression  has recovered her usual vivacity  With people extremely full of spirits  love is not apt to sink very deep  or last long  when it does not meet with a return   October 30  My mother sets out for London to morrow  and Mr Arnold has proposed to me  that he and I should accompany her  He says  he wants to look out for a house  and should like to fix in one before the weather advances  and that we may take up our abode at my mother’s till our house is ready for us  My mother is charmed at this proposal  she dreads the thought of parting with me  and as she intends going  after a convenient stay in London  down to Sidney castle  if I remain here  our separation must be immediate  I know this is Mr Arnold’s kind reason for desiring me to go  he thinks I shall be less affected at    parting with my mother  when in the midst of the various scenes which London affords  than I should be if I were to continue here  He does not give this for a reason  but I know it is his true one  for he is not fond of London himself  especially at a season of the year  when the country is so much more agreeable  I thanked him for this mark
