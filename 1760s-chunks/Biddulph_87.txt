the most termagant spirit that ever animated a female breast  her ruling and governing passion is avarice  and yet  strange to tell  generosity is of all things what she professes to admire  and is most studious of having thought her characteristic  Her pretensions to this virtue I have opposed to her vice of avarice  as the terms appropriated to each seem most contrary in their natures  yet I do not mean by generosity  that bounteous disposition which is commonly understood by the word  no  no  she aimed at the reputation of this virtue in our most exalted idea of it  and would fain be thought a woman of a great soul  This phrase was often in her mouth  and though her whole conduct gave the lye to her professions  she would tell you fifty stories  without a word of truth in any of them  to prove how nobly she had acted on such and such occasions  On the knowlege of this part of her temper  I chiefly built my hopes of success   I kept up a sort of forced conversation during the rest of our journey  She was sullen  but not rude  As I was far from desiring to come to an eclaircissement with her  I did not wish to have her in better temper   We reached the inn  which was about a mile on our side    of Rochester  at eight o’clock in the morning  This was a favourable hour  as by that time every traveller must have left the stages they lay at  The house stood alone  and luckily enough had no company in it  My old servant  Lamb  had received my instructions by letter  and was prepared accordingly for our reception  This was the place to which I had ordered the maid to be carried  she had arrived there some time before us  and was safely lodged   The chariot drove into the court yard close to the door of the inn  the step was let down in an instant  and Mrs Lamb appeared to receive us  We both darted into the house  Dressed as we were for a ball  we made an odd appearance as travellers at that hour of the morning  I believe this consideration made Mrs Gerrarde very readily hurry upstairs with the woman of the house   I enquired for Mrs Gerrarde’s maid  having given orders to Lamb that she should not been seen till I first spoke to her  I was carried into the room where she was  she seemed very glad that we were arrived  I desired her to lay out her lady’s toilet  which I concluded she had brought with her  for that Mrs Gerrarde would presently put herself in a proper habit for travelling  The maid told me she had brought her mistress’s riding dress with her  and as many other things of her wearing apparel as she could conveniently carry  I saw a vast heap of things lying unpacked on a bed which was in the room  and asked her how she had managed so cleverly as to get such a number of things together without observation  She told me she had lost no time  from the minute I left her  till the arrival of her guide  but had employed the interval in carrying out some of the best of her lady’s cloaths piece by piece  and conveying them to the cottage  which she could easily do without the servants seeing her  for as it was dark  she passed in and out without observation  Here she huddled them into a large portmanteau  After this she went to examine her lady’s escruitore  but was a long time puzzled in endeavouring to open it  as none of the keys I had given her answered  She endeavoured to force it open with as little noise as possible  but in vain  She then had recourse to a second trial of the keys  when one of them  which probably had been passed by before  luckily opened the lock  and she secured all the money and jewels she could find  These  said she  kept me in continual dread all the way as I travelled  for I have eight hundred pounds in bank notes  and though my lady has such a quantity of jewels on her  I am sure I have as many more about me  which I have hid in different parts of my cloaths     I commended the girl’s diligence  as indeed it deserved  and having before ordered tea and coffee into Mrs Gerrarde’s room  I now went in to breakfast with her  I found the woman of the house still with her  at which I was not at all uneasy  for as she had been tutored by her husband  I knew she was not to be wrought upon  if Mrs Gerrarde had attempted it   As I did not at that time desire a tête à tête with her  I contrived to keep Mrs Lamb in the room  by desiring her to drink tea with us   When we had done breakfast  I told Mrs Gerrarde  that as I feared she was a good deal fatigued  if it was agreeable to her  we would remain where we were for that day  and that I would by all means have her think of taking some rest  She said she was extremely tired  and should
