pleasure  and without hurry   253 and confusion  For all her servants are early risers of course  What servants can for shame be in bed  at a reasonable hour to be up  when they have a master or mistress s example for early rising   Yet this fine Lady loves to go to the public places  and often goes  and makes a brilliant figure there  She has time for them  and earns her pleasures by her early rising   Miss Grandison  Jenny tells me  has two humble servants  I wonder she has not two and twenty   One is Sir Walter Watkyns  a man of a large estate in Somersetshire  the other is Lord G  son of the Earl of G   but neither of them highly approved by her  Yet Jenny says  they are both of them handsome men  and admired by the Ladies  This makes me afraid  that they are modern men  and pay their court by the exterior appearance  rather than by interior worth  Who  my Lucy  that has heard what my late grandfather has said  and my grandmamma still says  of the men in their youthful days  will not say  that we have our lots cast in an age of Petits Maitres  and Insignificants   Such an amiable woman is Miss Charlotte Grandison—May I be found  on further acquaintance  but half as lovely in her eyes  as she is in mine —Don t be jealous  Lucy  I hope I have a large heart  I hope there is room in it for half a dozen sweet female friends —Yes  altho  another Love were to intervene  I could not bear  that even the affection due to the man of my choice  were I to marry  should  like Aaron s rod  swallow up all the rest   But now for her brother—My deliverer   But pray now  Lucy  don t you come with your sharp look out  I warrant you will expect on this occasion to read the tumults of the poor girl s heart in her character and description of a man  to whom she is so much obliged —But what if she disappoints you  and yet do justice to his manifold excellencies    254 What if she find some faults in him  that his sister has not   Parading Harriet  methinks you say  Teazing girl  Go on  go on  leave it to us to find you out  And take care that the very faults you pretend to discover  do not pass for a colour only  and lead to your detection   Thank you  Lucy  for your caution  But I will not be obliged to it  My pen shall follow the dictates of my heart  and if it be as honest to me  as I think it is to every body else  I hope I have nothing to fear either from your look out  or  which is still a sharper  my uncle Selby s   Sir Charles Grandison  in his person  is really a very fine man  He is tall  rather slender than full  His face in shape is a fine oval  He seems to have florid health  health confirmed by exercise   His complexion seems to have been naturally too fine for a man  But as if he were above being regardful of it  his face is overspread with a manly sunniness  I want a word  that shews he has been in warmer climates than England  And so it seems he has  since the Tour of Europe has not contented him  He has visited some parts of Asia  and even of Afric  Egypt particularly   I wonder what business a man has for such fine teeth  and so fine a mouth  as Sir Charles Grandison might boast of  were he vain   In his aspect there is something great and noble  that shews him to be of rank  Were kings to be chosen for beauty and majesty of person  Sir Charles Grandison would have few competitors  His eye—Indeed  my Lucy  his eye shews  if possible  more of sparkling intelligence than that of his sister—  Now pray be quiet  my dear uncle Selby  What is beauty in a man to me  You all know that I never thought beauty a qualification in a man   And yet  this grandeur in his person and air is accompanied   255 companied with so much ease and freedom of manners  as engages one s love with one s reverence  His good breeding renders him very accessible  His sister says  he is always the first to break thro  the restraints  and to banish the diffidences  that will generally attend persons on a quite new acquaintance  He may  for he is sure of being acceptable in whatever he does or says   Very true  Lucy  Shake your head if you please   In a word  he has such an easy  yet manly politeness  as well in his dress  as in his address  no singularity appearing in either  that were he not a fine figure of a man  but were even plain and hard featured  he would be thought  what is far more eligible in a man  than mere beauty  very agreeable   Sir
