 a fortnight or so  before winter  and two hundred I have brought with   me  and I have money  I know not what  in three places here  the account   of which is in my pocket book  in my library       You have made some little presents  Pamela  to my servants there  on our   nuptials  and these two hundred that I have brought up  I will put into   your disposal  that  with some of them  you shall do here as you did   there       I am ashamed  good sir  said I  to be so costly  and so worthless  Pray    my dear  replied he  say not a word of that  Said Mr  Longman  Why    madam  with money in stocks  and one thing or another  his honour could   buy half the gentlemen around him  He wants not money  and lays up every   year  And it would have been pity but his honour should have wedded   just as he has  Very true  Longman  said my master  and  pulling out   his purse  said  Tell out  my dear  two hundred guineas  and give me the   rest   I did so  Now  said he  take them yourself  for the purposes I   mentioned  But  Mr  Longman  do you  before sunset  bring my dear girl   fifty pounds  which is due to her this day  by my promise  and every   three months  from this day  pay her fifty pounds  which will be two   hundred pounds per annum  and this is for her to lay out at her own   discretion  and without account  in such a way as shall derive a   blessing upon us all  for she was my mother s almoner  and shall be   mine  and her own too   I ll go for it this instant  said Mr  Longman       When he was done  I looked upon my dear generous master  and on Mrs    Jervis  and he gave me a nod of assent  and I took twenty guineas    and said  Dear Mrs  Jervis  accept of this  which is no more than my   generous master ordered me to present to Mrs  Jewkes  for a pair of   gloves  on my happy nuptials  and so you  who are much better entitled   to them by the love I bear you  must not refuse them       Said she  Mrs  Jewkes was on the spot  madam  at the happy time  Yes    said my master  but Pamela would have rejoiced to have had you there   instead of her  That I should  sir  replied I  or instead of any body    except my own mother  She gratefully accepted them  and thanked us both    But I don t know what she should thank me for  for I was not worth a   fourth of them myself       I d have you  my dear  said he  in some handsome manner  as you know   how  oblige Longman to accept of the like present       Mr  Longman returned from his office  and brought me the fifty pounds    saying  I have entered this new article with great pleasure   To my Lady   fifty pounds  to be paid the same sum quarterly   O sir  said I    what will become of me  to be so poor in myself  and so rich in your   bounty   It is a shame to take all that your profuse goodness would   heap upon me thus  But indeed it shall not be without account   Make no   words  my dear  said he  Are you not my wife  And have I not endowed you   with my goods  and  hitherto  this is a very small part       Mr  Longman  said I  and Mrs  Jervis  you both see how I am even   oppressed with unreturnable obligations  God bless the donor  and the   receiver too  said Mr  Longman  I am sure they will bring back good   interest  for  madam  you had ever a bountiful heart  and I have seen   the pleasure you used to take to dispense my late lady s alms and   donations       I ll warrant  Mr  Longman  said I  notwithstanding you are so willing to   have me take large sums for nothing at all  I should affront you  if   I asked you to accept from me a pair of gloves only  on account of my   happy nuptials  He seemed not readily to know how to answer  and my   master said  If Longman refuse you  my dear
