 birth  came along with a lady of her own country  to visit several parts   of Europe merely for pleasure  that the lady was still at Venice  and   that on some little disgust between them  she who was there  meaning   Louisa  had quitted her  and was now returning home by the way of   Leghorn  of the truth of what he told them  he added  they might be   informed  by sending to Venice the next day       He also said  that having a business to be negotiated in England  he had   followed this young lady  in order to beg the favour of her to deliver   letters to some friends he had there  not having the opportunity of   making this request before  by reason of her departure having been so   sudden  that he knew nothing of it before she was gone       The truth of all this Louisa confirmed  and on farther talk of the   affair  acquainted them  that the gentleman who had occasioned this   disturbance  for she forbore mentioning his name  had often sollicited   her love on unlawful terms  and being rejected by her  had taken this   dishonourable way of compassing his desires  at a place where he knew   she was alone  and wholly a stranger       The fright and confusion she had been in  had rendered her so faint    that it was with infinite difficulty she brought out these words  but   having something given her to refresh her spirits  and being conducted   into another room out of the crowd  she began  by degrees  to   recover herself       Monsieur du Plessis then informed her  that on coming to Melanthe s  and   hearing she was gone  he immediately took boat  resolving to prevail on   her to alter her resolution of going to England  or dye at her feet    that he easily found the inn she was at  and that the man of the house   presently told him  such a person as he described was there  but that he   understood she had eloped from her husband  who had pursued  and was now   above with her       Never  said this faithful lover  did any horror equal what I felt at   this intelligence   The base count de Bellfleur came presently into my   mind   I thought it could be no other who had taken this abhored method   of accomplishing the menaces you may remember I repeated to you   I was   going to fly up stairs that instant  but was withheld  and found it best   to argue the man into reason  who  I found  was fully prepossessed you   were his wife  as I was giving some part of your history  I saw the   count s man passing thro  the hall  he saw me too  and would have   avoided me  but I ran to him  seized him by the throat  and asked him   what business had brought either him or his master to this place  the   disorder he was in  and the hesitation with which he spoke  together   with refusing to give any direct answer  very much staggered the   innkeeper  who was just consenting to go up with me to your chamber  and   examine into the truth of this affair  when we saw you come down  armed   as your virtue prompted  and at the same time flying from the   villain s pursuit       Louisa could not help confessing that she owed the preservation of her   honour wholly to him  for  said she  the people were so fully persuaded   not only that I was his wife  but also that I had fled from him on some   unwarrantable intent  that all I did  or could have done  would only   have served to render me more guilty in their opinion  and it must have   been by death alone I could have escaped the monster s more   detested lust       Monsieur du Plessis now made use of every argument that love and wit   could inspire  to prevail with her to accept of the offer contained in   the letter he had wrote to her  and concluded with reminding her  that   if the charming confession her answer had made him was to be depended   on  and that she had indeed a heart not wholly uninfluenced by his   passion  she would not refuse agreeing to a proposal  which not the most   rigid virtue and honour could disapprove       Louisa on this replied with blushes  that since  by the belief she   should never see him more  she had been unwarily drawn in to declare   herself so far  she neither could  nor would attempt to deny what she   had said  but  added she
