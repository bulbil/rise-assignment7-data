use to yourself  or any other   person living  either with respect to this world or the world to   come  Could you make a pin  or a waistcoat button  or form a   pill box  or weave a cabbage net  or shape a cobbler s last  or hew   a block for a barber  or do any of those things by which millions   daily maintain themselves in supplying the wants and occasions    or fashions and vanities of others  you might not be under the   necessity of perishing      The ways of life for which your studies have best prepared you   are physic and the law  But then they require great expense  and   an intense application of many years to come  before you can   propose to enter on a livelihood by either of those professions    And  after all  your success would be very precarious  if you were   not supported by many friends and a strong interest  at least on   your setting out      I have already told you  Clement  that I am not rich  and if I   were  it is not he who gives you money  but he who puts you into   a way of getting it  that does you a friendship      I am advised to go to Montpelier for the establishment of my   health  after a tedious fit of sickness that I had at Bath  I shall   set out in about a month  But before I go  my child  I earnestly   wish and advise you to fix on some craft or trade or manner of em    ploying your time  that will enable you to earn a certain subsistence    and  at the same time  make you a worthy member of the commu    nity  For  believe me  my boy  that it is not speculative science    no  nor all the money and jewels upon earth  that make any part   of the real wealth of this world  It is industry alone  employed on   articles that are useful and beneficial to society  that constitutes   the true riches of all mankind      As soon as you have made your election  let me see you again     and  at all events  let me see you before I set out      Hereupon I bowed and retired  the most mortified and dejected         THE FOOL OF QUALITY          75         of all beings  I was so low and dispirited that I could scarce get   to my lodgings  I threw myself on the bed  The gilding of the   vapours of grandeur and ambition  that  like the sky of a summer s   evening  had delighted my prospects  now wholly disappeared  and   a night of succeeding darkness fell heavy on my soul      One third of my principal fund was almost sunk  and my imagina    tion considered the remainder as already vanished  without the   possibility of supply or resource  I now secretly cursed the vanity   of my father   He must breed me a gentleman  thought I  as though   I had been born to no manner of end  Had I been the son of a   cobbler  of a porter  an ostler  of the lowest wretch who wins his   bread by the sweat of his brow  I should not yet have been reduced   to the worst species of beggary that of begging with sound limbs   and a reasonable soul  the least pitied  though most pitiable  object   of the creation   for  surely  that is the case of a poor scholar and   a poor gentleman       For some following days I went about prying and inquiring   into the various and numberless occupations that maintained so   many thousands of active hands and busy faces throughout that   wonderful city      One evening  as I returned late and fatigued through Cheapside    I observed a man very importunate with a woman who walked   before me  Sometimes she would hurry on  and again make a full   stop  and earnestly beseech him to go about his business   but  in   spite of her entreaties  he still stuck close to her  till  coming to the   end of a blind alley  he suddenly seized her by the arm  and pulled   her in after him      She shrieked out for help with repeated vociferation   when    recollecting all my force  and drawing my sword Villain   I cried   out  quit the woman instantly  or you are a dead man   He per    ceived the glittering of the weapon  and retired a few paces   but    taking out a pocket pistol
