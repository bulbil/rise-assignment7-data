petulance  that I hope is not natural to  Your HARRIET BYRON     24  LETTER III  Miss HARRIET BYRON  To Miss LUCY SELBY    Thursday Night  Mar  2   AND what do you think was the reason of Mr  Reeves s reserves  A most alarming one  I am obliged to him  that he kept it from me  tho  the uncertainty did not a little affect me  Take the account of it  as it comes out   I told you in my former  that the person to whom Sir Charles was sent for out  was Mr  Bagenhall  and that Sir Charles had sent in for Mr  Reeves  who returned to the company with a countenance that I did not like so well as I did Sir Charles s  I now proceed to give you  from Minutes of Mr  Reeves  what passed on the occasion   Sir Charles took Mr  Reeves aside—This unhappy man  Sir Hargrave  I mean  said he  seems to me to want an excuse to himself  for putting up with a treatment which he thinks disgraceful  When we have to deal with children  humours must be a little allowed for  But you ll hear what the proposal is now  Let not the Ladies  however  nor the Gentlemen  within  know any thing of the matter till all is over  This is a day devoted to pleasure  But you  Mr  Reeves  know something of the matter  and can answer for your fair cousin   He then led Mr  Reeves in to Mr  Bagenhall   This  Sir  is Mr  Reeves —Sir Hargrave  in short  Mr  Reeves  among other demands that I cannot comply with  but which relate only to myself  and therefore need not be mentioned  insists upon an introduction to Miss Byron  He says  she is absolutely disengaged—Is she  Sir   I dare say she is  answered my cousin     25 This gentleman has been naming to me Mr  Greville  Mr  Orme  and others   No one of them has ever met with the shadow of encouragement from my cousin  She is above keeping any man in suspense  when she is not in any herself  Nothing has given her more uneasiness than the number of her Admirers   Miss Byron  said Sir Charles  must be admired by every one that beholds her  but still more by those who are admitted to the honour of conversing with her  But Sir Hargrave is willing to build upon her disengagement something in his own favour  Is there any room for Sir Hargrave  who pleads his sufferings for her  who vows his honourable intentions even at the time that he was hoping to gain her by so unmanly a violence  and appeals to her for the purity  as he calls it  of his behaviour to her  all the time she was in his hands—who makes very large offers of settlements—is there any room to hope  that Miss Byron—  No  none at all  Sir Charles—  What  not to save a life  Mr  Reeves —said Mr  Bagenhall   If you mean mine  Mr  Bagenhall  replied Sir Charles  I beg that that may not be considered  If Sir Hargrave means his own  I will pronounce that safe from any premeditated resentment of mine  Do you think Miss Byron will bear to see Sir Hargrave  Mr Reeves  I presume he intends to beg pardon of her  Will she consent to receive a visit from him —But is not this wretched trisling  Mr  Bagenhall   You will remember  Sir Charles  this is a proposal of mine  what I hoped might be agreed to by Sir Hargrave  but that I was willing to consult you before I mentioned it to him   I beg your pardon  Mr  Bagenhall  I now remember it   If ever man doated upon a woman  said Mr  Bagenhall    26 it is Sir Hargrave on Miss Byron  The very methods he took to obtain her for a wife  shew that most convincingly —You will promise not to stand in his way Sir   I repeat  Mr  Bagenhall  what I have heretofore told you  That Miss Byron  You ll excuse me  Mr  Reeves  is still under my protection  If Sir Hargrave  as he ought  is inclin d to ask her pardon  and if he can obtain it  and even upon his own terms  I shall think Miss Byron and he may be happier together than at present I can imagine it possible  I am not desirous to be any way considered  but as her protector from violence and insult  and that I will be  if she claim it  in defiance of an hundred such men as Sir Hargrave  But then  Sir  the occasion must be sudden  No legal relief must be at hand  I will not  either for an adversary s sake  or my own  be defied into a cool and premeditated vengeance   But  Sir Charles  Sir Hargrave has some hardships in this case  You will not give him the satisfaction of a Gentleman  And  according to the Laws of Honour  a
