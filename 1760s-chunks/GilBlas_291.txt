in under my tuition  you would have become a physician of the first skill and eminence  with the guiding influence of heaven to defend you from the dangerous allurements of chemistry  Ah  my son  pursued he with a mournful air  what a change in practice within these few years  The whole honour and dignity of the art is compromised  That mystery  by whose inscrutable decrees the lives of men have in all ages been determined  is now laid open to the rude  untutored gaze of blockheads  novices  and mountebanks  Facts are stubborn things  and ere long the very stones will cry aloud against the rascality of these new practitioners  lapides clamabunt  Why  sir  there are fellows in this town  calling themselves physicians  who drag their degraded persons at the currus triumphalis antimonii  or as it should properly be translated  the cart s tail of antimony  Apostates from the faith of Paracelsus  idolaters of filthy kermes  healers at haphazard  who make all the science of medicine to consist in the preparation and prescription of drugs  What a change have I to announce to you  There is not one stone left upon another in the whole structure which our great predecessors had raised  Bleeding in the feet  for example  so rarely practised in better times  is now among the fashionable follies of the day  That gentle  civilized system of evacuation which prevailed under my auspices is subverted by the reign of anarchy and emetics  of quackery and poison  In short  chaos is come again  Every one orders what seems good in his own eyes  there is no deference to the authority of ancient wisdom  our masters are laid upon the shelf  and their axioms not one tittle the more regarded  for being delivered in languages as defunct as the subjects of their application   However desirable it might seem to laugh at so whimsical a declamation  I had the good manners to resist the impulse  and not only that  but to inveigh bitterly against kermes  without knowing whether it was a vegetable or an animal  and to pour forth a commination of curses against the authors and inventors of so diabolical an engine  Scipio  observing my by play in this scene  had a mind to come in for his share in the banter  Most venerable prop of the true practice  said he to Sangrado  as I am descended in the third generation from a physician of the old school  give me leave to join you in your philippic against chemical conspiracies  My late illustrious progenitor  heaven forgive him all his sins  was so warm a partisan of Hippocrates  that he often came to blows with ignorant pretenders  who vomited forth blasphemies against that high priest of the faculty  What is bred in the bone will not come out of the flesh  I could willingly inflict tortures and death with my own hands on those rash innovators whose daring enormities you have characterized with such accuracy of discrimination and such force of language  When wretches like these gain an ascendancy in civilized society  can we wonder at the disjointed condition of the world   The times are even more out of joint than you are aware of  said the doctor  My book against the vanities and delusions of the new practice might as well have fallen still born from the press  it seems  if anything  to have acted by contraries  and to have exasperated heresy  The apothecaries  like the Titans of old  heaping potion upon pill  and invading the Olympus of medicine  think themselves fully qualified to usurp and maintain the throne  now that it is only thought necessary to set open the doors  and to drive the enemy out at the portal or the postern by main force  They go to the length of infusing their deadly drugs into apozems and cordials  and then set themselves up against the most eminent of the fraternity  This contagion has spread its influence even among the cloisters  There are monks in our convents who unite surgery and pharmacy to the labours of the confessional  Those medical baboons are always dipping their paws into chemistry  and inventing compositions strong enough to lay a scene of ecclesiastical mortality in the temperate abodes of peace and religion  Now there are in Valladolid above sixty religious houses for both sexes  judge what ravage must have been made there by unmerciful pumping and the lancet misapplied  Signor Sangrado  said I  you are perfectly in the right to give these poisoners no quarter  I utter groan for groan with you  and heave the philanthropic sigh over the invaded lives of our fellow creatures  sinking under the fell attack of so heterodox a practice  It fills me with horror to think what a dead weight chemistry may one day be to medicine  just as adulterated coin operates on national credit  Far be that evil day from this generation   Just at this climax of our discourse  in came an old female servant  with a salver for the doctor  on which was a little light roll and a glass with two decanters  the one filled with water and the other with wine  After he had eaten a slice  he washed it down with a diluted beverage  two parts water to one of wine  but this temperate use of the good creature did not at all save him from
