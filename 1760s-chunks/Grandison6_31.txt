  Yet in so particular a situation  altho  what I have to say  may  I presume  be collected from what you know of my story  and tho  my humble application to Miss Byron for her favour  and to you  Ladies  for your interest with her  have not been discouraged  something  however  may be necessary to be said  in this audience  of the state of my own heart  for the sake of this dear Lady s delicacy  and yours  And I will deliver myself with all the truth and plainness which I think are required in treaties of this nature  equally with those set on foot between nation and nation   I am not insensible to Beauty  But the beauty of person only  never yet had power over more than my eye  to which it gave a pleasure like that which it receives from the flowers of a gay parterre  Had not my heart been out of the reach of personal attractions  if I may so express myself  and had I been my own master  Miss Byron  in the first hour that I saw her  for her beauty suffered not by her distress  would have left me no other choice  But when I had the honour of conversing with her  I observed in her mind and behaviour that true dignity  delicacy  and noble frankness  which I ever thought characteristic in the Sex  but never met with  in equal degree  but in one Lady  I soon found  that my admiration of her fine qualities was likely to lead me into a gentler  yet a more irresistable passion  For of the Lady abroad I then could have no reasonable  at least  no probable hope  Yet were there circumstances between her and me  which I thought  in strict justice  obliged me to attend the issue of certain events   I called myself therefore to account  and was   78 alarmed when I found that Miss Byron s graces had stolen so imperceptibly on my heart  as already to have made an impression on it too deep for my tranquillity  I determined therefore  in honour  in justice  to both Ladies  to endeavour to restrain a passion so new  yet likely to be so servent   I had avocations in town  while Miss Byron was with my sisters in the country  Almost afraid of trusting myself in her presence  I pursued the more will ingly those avocations in person  when I could have managed some of them  perhaps  near as well by other hands  Compassion for the one Lady  because of her calamity  might  at that time  I found  have been made to give way  could those calamities have been overcome  to Love for the other  Nor was it difficult for me to observe  that my sisters and Lord L  who knew nothing of my situation  would have chosen for a sister the young Lady present  before every other woman   Sometimes  I will own to you  I was ready  from that self partiality and vanity which is too natural to men of vivacity and strong hopes  to flatter myself  that I might  by my sisters interest  have made myself  not unacceptable to a Lady  who seemed to be wholly disengaged in her affections  But I would not permit myself to dwell on such hopes  Every look of complaisance  every smile  which used to beam over that lovely countenance  I attributed to her natural goodness  and frankness of heart  and to that grateful spirit which made her over rate a common service that I had been so happy as to render her  Had I even been free  I should have been careful not to deprive myself of that animating sunshine  by a too early declaration  For well did I know  by other mens experience  that Miss Byron  at the same time that her natural politeness  and sweetness of manners  engaged every heart  was not  however  easily to be won   But  notwithstanding all my efforts to prevent a   79 competition which had grown so fast upon me  I still found my uneasiness increase with my affection for Miss Byron  I had then but one way left—It was  to strengthen my heart  in Clementina s cause  by Miss Byron s assistance  In short  to acquaint Miss Byron with my situation  to engage her generosity for Clementina  and thereby deprive myself of the encouragement my fond heart might have hoped for  had I indulged my wishes of obtaining her favour  My end was answered  as to the latter  Miss Byron s generosity was engaged for the Lady  but was it possible that my obligations to her for that generosity should not add to my admiration of her   At the time I laid before her my situation  it was in Lord L s Study at Colnebrooke  she saw my emotion  I could not conceal it  My abrupt departure from her  must convince her  that my heart was too much engaged for that situation  a   I desired Dr  Bartlett to take an airing with me  in hopes  by his counsels  to compose my disordered spirits  b   He knew the state of my heart  He knew
