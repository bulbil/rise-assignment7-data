has not abandoned me  I shall be under no   necessity to make advances to Mr  Williams  if I was  as I am sure I am   not  disposed to it  This is his letter           I know not how to express myself  lest I should appear to you to have   a selfish view in the service I would do you  But I really know but one   effectual and honourable way to disengage yourself from the dangerous   situation you are in  It is that of marriage with some person that you   could make happy in your approbation  As for my own part  it would be    as things stand  my apparent ruin  and  worse still  I should involve   you in misery too  But  yet  so great is my veneration for you  and   so entire my reliance on Providence  upon so just an occasion  that I   should think myself but too happy  if I might be accepted  I would  in   this case  forego all my expectations  and be your conductor to some   safe distance  But why do I say  in this case  That I will do  whether   you think fit to reward me so eminently or not  And I will  the moment I   hear of Mr  B     s setting out   and I think now I have settled a very   good method of intelligence of all his motions   get a horse ready    and myself to conduct you  I refer myself wholly to your goodness and   direction  and am  with the highest respect                                     Your most faithful humble servant         Don t think this a sudden resolution  I always admired your   hear say character  and the moment I saw you  wished to serve so much   excellence           What shall I say  my dear father and mother  to this unexpected   declaration  I want  now  more than ever  your blessing and direction    But  after all  I have no mind to marry  I had rather live with you  But   yet  I would marry a man who begs from door to door  and has no home nor   being  rather than endanger my honesty  Yet I cannot  methinks  hear of   being a wife   After a thousand different thoughts  I wrote as follows           REVEREND SIR        I am greatly confused at the contents of your last  You are much too   generous  and I can t bear you should risk all your future prospects   for so unworthy a creature  I cannot think of your offer without equal   concern and gratitude  for nothing  but to avoid my utter ruin  can make   me think of a change of condition  and so  sir  you ought not to accept   of such an involuntary compliance  as mine would be  were I  upon the   last necessity  to yield to your very generous proposal  I will rely   wholly upon your goodness to me  in assisting my escape  but shall not    on your account principally  think of the honour you propose for me at   present  and never  but at the pleasure of my parents  who  poor as they   are  in such a weighty point  are as much entitled to my obedience and   duty  as if they were ever so rich  I beg you  therefore  sir  not   to think of any thing from me  but everlasting gratitude  which shall   always bind me to be  Your most obliged servant           Thursday  Friday  Saturday  the 14th  15th  and 16th  of my bondage       Mrs  Jewkes has received a letter  and is much civiller to me  and Mr    Williams too  than she used to be  I wonder I have not one in answer to   mine to my master  I suppose I put the matter too home to him  and he   is angry  I am not the more pleased with her civility  for she is horrid   cunning  and is not a whit less watchful  I laid a trap to get at her   instructions  which she carries in the bosom of her stays  but it has   not succeeded       My last letter is come safe to Mr  Williams by the old conveyance  so   that he is not suspected  He has intimated  that though I have not come   so readily as he hoped into his scheme  yet
