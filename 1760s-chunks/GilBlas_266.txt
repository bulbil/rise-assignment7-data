 and our arrangements are already made  Give notice to the ladies  through the medium of the cash you have just brought  it is proper to let them know they have no ordinary lover to receive  and a matter of course that generosity in princes should be the herald of their partialities  As you will be of our party  take care to be in the way at bed time  and as your carriage will be wanted  let it wait near the palace about midnight   I immediately repaired to the ladies  Catalina was not visible  having just gone to lie down  I could only speak with Signora Mencia  Madam  said I  forgive my appearance here in the day  time  but there was no avoiding it  you must know that the Prince of Spain will be with you to night  and here  added I  putting my pecuniary credentials into her hand  here is an offering which he lays on the Cytherean shrine  to propitiate the divinities of the temple  You may perceive  I have not entangled you in a sleeveless concern  You have been excessively kind indeed  answered she  but tell me  Signor de Santillane  does the prince love music  To distraction  replied I  There is nothing he so much delights in as a fine voice  with a delicate lute accompaniment So much the better  exclaimed she in a transport of joy  you give me great pleasure by saying so  for my niece has the pipe of a nightingale  and plays exquisitely on the lute  then her dancing is in the finest style  Heavens and earth  exclaimed I in my turn  here are accomplishments by wholesale  aunt  more than enough to make any girl s fortune  Any one of those talents would have been a sufficient dowry   Having thus smoothed his reception  I waited for the prince s bed time  When it was near at hand  I gave my coachman his orders  and went to the Count de Lemos  who told me that the prince  the sooner to get rid of the people about him  meant to feign a slight indisposition  and even to go to bed  the better to cajole his attendants  but that he would get up an hour afterwards  and go through a private door to a back staircase leading into the court yard   Conformably with their previous arrangements  he fixed my station  There had I to beat the hoof so long  that I began to suspect our forward sprig of royalty had gone another way  or else had changed his mind about Catalina  just as if princes ever began to be fickle  till the goad of novelty and curiosity began to be blunted  In short  I thought they had forgotten me  when two men came up  Finding them to be my party  I led the way to my carriage  into which they both got  and I upon the coach box to direct the driver  whom I stopped fifty yards from the house  whither we walked  The door opened at our approach  and shut again as soon as we got in   At first we were in absolute darkness  as on my former visit  though a small lamp was fixed to the wall on the present occasion  But the light which it shed was so faint  as only to render itself visible without assisting us  All this served only to heighten the romance in the fancy of its hero  fixed as he was in steadfast gaze at the sight of the ladies as they received him in a saloon whose brilliant illumination was more dazzling  when contrasted with the gloom of the avenue  The aunt and niece were in a tempting undress  where the science of coquetry was displayed in all its luxury and absolute sway  Our prince could have been happy with Signora Mencia  had the dear charmer Catalina been away  but as there was a choice  the younger  according to the rules of precedency in the court of Cupid  had the preference   Well  prince  said the Count de Lemos  could you have desired a better specimen of beauty  They are both enchanting  answered the prince  and my heart may as well surrender at once  for the aunt would arrest it in its flight  if it attempted to sound a retreat from the niece s all subduing charms   After such compliments  as do not fall by wholesale to the share of aunts  he addressed his choicest terms of flattery to Catalina  who answered him in kind  As convenient personages of my stamp are allowed to mingle in the conversation of lovers  for the purpose of making fire hotter  I introduced the subject of singing and playing on the lute  This was the signal of fresh rapture  and the nymph  the muse  the anything but mortal  was supplicated to outtune the jingle of the spheres  She complied like a good humoured goddess  played some tender airs  and sung so deliciously  that the prince flopped down on his knees in a tumult of love and pleasure  But scenes like these are vapid in description  suffice it to say that hours glided away like moments in this sweet delirium  till the approach of day warned the sober plotters of the lunacy to provide for their patient s
