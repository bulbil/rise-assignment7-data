 Being joined by their fellow travellers in the morning  they made a  tour to all the remarkable places in this celebrated village  saw the  foundry  the Stadthouse  the Spinhuys  Vauxhall  and Count Bentinck s  gardens  and in the evening went to the French comedy  which was  directed by a noted harlequin  who had found means to flatter the Dutch  taste so effectually  that they extolled him as the greatest actor that  ever appeared in the province of Holland  This famous company did not  represent regular theatrical pieces  but only a sort of impromptus   in which this noted player always performed the greatest part of the  entertainment  Among other sallies of wit that escaped him  there was  one circumstance so remarkably adapted to the disposition and genius of  his audience  that it were a pity to pass it over in silence  A windmill  being exhibited on the scene  harlequin  after having surveyed it  with curiosity and admiration  asks one of the millers the use of that  machine  and being told that it was a windmill  observes  with some  concern  that as there was not the least breath of wind  he could not  have the pleasure of seeing it turn round  Urged by this consideration   he puts himself into the attitude of a person wrapt in profound  meditation  and  having continued a few seconds in this posture  runs  to the miller with great eagerness and joy  and  telling him that he  had found an expedient to make his mill work  very fairly unbuttons his  breeches  Then presenting his posteriors to the sails of the machine   certain explosions are immediately heard  and the arms of the mill  begin to turn round  to the infinite satisfaction of the spectators  who  approve the joke with loud peals of applause   Our travellers stayed a few days at the Hague  during which the young  gentleman waited on the British ambassador  to whom he was recommended  by his excellency at Paris  and lost about thirty guineas at billiards  to a French adventurer  who decoyed him into the snare by keeping up his  game  Then they departed in a post waggon for Amsterdam  being provided  with letters of introduction to an English merchant residing in that  city  under whose auspices they visited everything worth seeing   and among other excursions  went to see a Dutch tragedy acted  an  entertainment which  of all others  had the strangest effect upon the  organs of our hero  the dress of their chief personages was so antic   their manner so awkwardly absurd  and their language so ridiculously  unfit for conveying the sentiment of love and honour  that Peregrine s  nerves were diuretically affected with the complicated absurdity  and    6 22 15  3 45 PM   he was compelled to withdraw twenty times before the catastrophe of the  piece   The subject of this performance was the famous story of Scipio s  continence and virtue  in restoring the fair captive to her lover   The young Roman hero was represented by a broadfaced Batavian  in a  burgomaster s gown and a fur cap  sitting smoking his pipe at a table  furnished with a can of beer  a drinking glass  and a plate of tobacco   The lady was such a person as Scipio might well be supposed to give  away  without any great effort of generosity  and indeed the Celtiberian  prince seemed to be of that opinion  for  upon receiving her from the  hand of the victor  he discovered none of those transports of gratitude  and joy which Livy describes in recounting this event  The Dutch Scipio   however  was complaisant enough in his way  for he desired her to sit at  his right hand  by the appellation of Ya frow  and with his own fingers  filling a clean pipe  presented it to Mynheer Allucio  the lover  The  rest of the economy of the piece was in the same taste  which was so  agreeable to the audience  that they seemed to have shaken off their  natural phlegm  in order to applaud the performance   From the play our company adjourned to the house of their friend  where  they spent the evening  and the conversation turning upon poetry  a  Dutchman who was present  and understood the English language  having  listened very attentively to the discourse  lifted up with both hands  the greatest part of a Cheshire cheese that lay upon the table  saying    I do know vat is boetre  Mine brotre be a great boet  and ave vrought  a book as dick as all dat   Pickle  diverted with this method of  estimating an author according to the quantity of his works  inquired  about the subjects of this bard s writings  but of these his brother  could give no account  or other information  but that there was little  market for the commodity  which hung heavy upon his hands  and induced  him to wish he had applied himself to another trade   The only remarkable scene in Amsterdam  which our company had not  seen  was the
