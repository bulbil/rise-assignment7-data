though reluctantly  was obliged to acquiesce   They remained thus two days longer  Mrs Faulkland’s complaints still furnishing her with a pretence for sleeping alone  and  under colour of not giving trouble in the family  she would not suffer a maid to sit up with her   Major Smyth  who had been in the house all this time  had now some call to his regiment  which obliged him to go to the town where it lay  and Mr Faulkland heard him give his man directions for their journey   Mrs Faulkland still kept her room  and had not left it since the time she was first taken ill  It happened that the chamber which was assigned for Mr Faulkland  immediately joined his lady’s  and was only separated from it by a wainscot partition  by which means he could hear the least stir in her chamber   The unsuspecting injured husband  whose anxiety for his faithless wife had always made him watchful and attentive to her motions  happened this night to be more than ordinarily so  The family had now been for some hours buried in sleep  every thing was profoundly silent for some time  Mr Faulkland  who hoped his lady was settled to rest  was endeavouring to compose himself to sleep  when he heard her stir  This immediately roused him  and raising his head off the pillow  he found she got out of bed  Though she seemed to use the utmost precaution  he nevertheless heard her very distinctly open her door  and go out  Surprized as he was at this motion  no other thought occurred to him  than that perhaps Mrs Faulkland  finding herself ill  had got up to call some of the female servants  Prepossessed with this belief  he started out of bed  and hastily slipping on his clothes  ran into his lady’s room  where he found her candle still burning   As he concluded she would presently return  he waited some    minutes in her chamber  at length  perceiving her clothes lying on a chair at her bed side  he was afraid she had gone out without putting any thing on her  and though the night was not cold  he was apprehensive  that in her apparently weak condition  her health might be farther injured   On this account  he determined to go in quest of her  and concluding she had gone to the apartment of the female servants  which was on the floor over that on which they lay  he ascended the stairs as silently as possibly   As he was passing by a room on the top of the first flight  he heard some one speak in a low voice  and listning  fancied it was his wife’s   As he knew not who lay in that room  he made no doubt but that it was she  who was calling the person that slept there  and  without farther reflection  hastily opened the door  and went in  with the candle  which he had taken in his hand  On his sudden entrance  the person  who was in bed  eagerly called out  Who is there  He soon perceived by his voice  that it was Major Smyth  He was about to make an apology for his intrusion  when he perceiving his lady’s wrapping gown  which he had seen her wear that morning  lying on the floor  and in the same instant recollecting that he had heard a woman’s voice when he was without side the door  the horror of her guilt rushed upon him at once  and without making any answer to the major  he suddenly drew back the feet curtains of the bed  where he plainly perceived that the major had a companion  though she had hid her head under the clothes   The major instantly leaped out of bed  and though he saw Mr Faulkland was unarmed  he snatched up one of his own pistols  which lay on the table  and which his man had charged that night  as they were to go a short journey the next morning  Mr Faulkland  in the first transports of his rage  seized the other  the miserable woman  observing their fatal motions  threw herself out of bed  Mr Faulkland was too much distracted to be able to give a distinct account of this dreadful incident  all he can say is  that Major Smyth snapped his pistol at him  which  he thinks  missed fire  and he instantly discharged his with more fatal success  for Mrs Faulkland  who had in the instant rushed between them shrieked out  and dropped on the ground  and the major reeling a few steps  fell against one of the pillars of the bed  and cried out  He has killed us both   Mr Faulkland says  that  after this dreadful action  without knowing what he did  he ran down stairs  and opening the front door     made the best of his way home on foot  The phrenzy of his mind was such that he thought not of providing for his safety  but having got into his house  he had no intention of going farther  when  in less than a quarter of an hour  one of his servants  whom he had left behind him at Mr Bond’s  a faithful fellow  who
