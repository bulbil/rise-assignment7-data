discontents throughout the kingdom  The clamour of the church s being in danger was revived  jealousies were received  and dangerous tumults raised in every part of the country  The party cry was  Down with the Whigs  Sacheveral for ever  During these commotions in the Pretender s favour  this   115 Prince himself continued only a calm spectator on the continent  now and then sending over his emissaries to inflame the disturbances  to disperse his ineffectual manifestoes  and to delude the unwary  Copies of a printed address were sent to the Dukes of Shrewsbury  Marlborough  Argyle  and other noblemen of the first distinction  vindicating the Pretender s right to the crown  and complaining of the injustice that was done him by receiving a foreigner  Yet  for all this  he still continued to profess the truest regard for the Catholic religion  and  instead of concealing his sentiments on that head  gloried in his principles  It was the being a Papist which had dispossessed his father of the throne  and surely the son could never hope to gain a crown by the very methods in which it was lost  but an infatuation seemed for ever to attend all the family   However odious  at that time  the Popish superstitions were to the people in general  yet the opinions of the Dissenters seemed still more displeasing  Religion was mingled with all political disputes  The High church party complained  that  under a Whig administration  impiety and heresy daily gained ground  that the prelates were at once negligent of religious concerns  and warm in pursuit of temporal blessings  A book written by Doctor Samuel Clarke  in favour of Socinianism  was strictly reprehended  the disputes among the Churchmen rose to such a height that the ministry was obliged to interpose  and the clergy received orders for finishing such like debates  and from intermeddling in affairs of state  Nothing  however  can be more impolitic in a state  than to prohibit the clergy from disputing with each other  by this means they become more animated in the cause of religion  and which ever side they defend  they become wiser and better  as they carry on the cause  To silence their disputes s to lead them into negligence  if religion be not   116 kept up by opposition  it falls to the ground  no longer becomes an object of public concern  Government  I say again  should never silence dispute  and should never side with either disputant   A new parliament was now called  in which the Whigs had by far the majority  all prepossessed with the strongest aversion to the Tories  and led on by the King himself  who made no secret of his displeasure  Upon their first meeting he informed them  that the branches of the revenue granted for the support of civil government  were not sufficient for that purpose  he apprized them of the machinations of the Pretender  and intimated that he expected their assistance in punishing such as had endeavoured to deprive him of that blessing which he most valued  the affection of his people  As the houses were then disposed  this served to give them the alarm  and they out went even the most sanguine expectations of the most vindictive ministry   Their resentment began with arraigning Lord Bolingbroke of high treason  and other high crimes and misdemeanors  To this it was objected by one of the members of the house of commons  that nothing in the allegations laid to his charge amounted to high treason  To this there was no reply given  but  Lord Coningsby standing up    The chairman  said he  has impeached the hand  but I impeach the head  he has impeached the scholar  and I the master  I impeach Robert Earl of Oxford  and Earl Mortimer  of high treason and other crimes and misdemeanors    When therefore this nobleman appeared the next day in the house of Lords  he was avoided  by his brother Peers  as infectious  he  whose favour had been but a little before so earnestly sought after  was now rejected and contemned  When the articles were read against him in the house of Peers  some debates arose as to the nature of his indictment  which  however  were carried by his adversaries  and the articles of impeachment   117 approved by the house  he was therefore again impeached at the bar of the house of Lords  and a motion was made that he might lose his seat  and be committed to close custody  The Earl now seeing a furious spirit of faction raised against him  and aiming at his head  was not wanting to himself  upon this emergency  but spoke to the following purpose   I am accused  says he  for having made a peace  a peace  which  bad as it is now represented  has been approved by two successive parliaments  For my own part  I always acted by the immediate directions and commands of the Queen my mistress  and never offended against any known law  I am justified in my own conscience  and unconcerned for the life of an insignificant old man  But I cannot  without the highest ingratitude  remain unconcerned for the best of Queens  obligation binds me to vindicate her memory  My Lords  if ministers of state
