all we can to comply with her commands  then   turned quick about  and resumed the discourse he was in  before   Horatio s entrance  with his officers  as much as to say  the business   of his love must not interrupt that of the war  and Horatio had   afterwards the opportunity of observing  that tho  he often looked upon   the picture of that amiable princess  which he always wore in his bosom    yet he would on a sudden snatch his eyes away  as fearing to be too   much softened       Horatio was ordered to be lodged in the castle where the garrison was   kept  but he was every day at the king s levee  and received the most   extraordinary marks of his favour and affection  for which  as he looked   upon himself entirely indebted to the recommendations of his friends in   France  he wrote letters of thanks  and an account of all that   happened to him       Poland being now entirely subdued by the valour and fortune of Charles   XII  and having received a king of his nomination  submitted cheerfully    glad to see an end of devastation  as they then flattered themselves    but the troubles of that unfortunate kingdom were yet to endure much   longer   Augustus  impatient of recovering what he had lost  and the   czar of Muscovy jealous and envious of the king of Sweden s glory  came   pouring with mighty armies from Saxony and Russia  Shullenburgh  the   general of the former  had passed the Oder  and the other  at the head   of a numerous body  was plundering all that came in his way  and putting   to the sword every one whom he even suspected of adhering to king   Stanislaus  so that nothing now was talked of but war  and the means   concerted how to put a stop to the miseries these two ambitious princes   made  not only in that country  but all the adjacent parts       It was agreed that general Renchild should go to meet Shullenburgh  and   the two kings drive out the Muscovites  who being divided into several   parties  Stanislaus went at the head of one army  and the king of Sweden   led another  and taking different routs  had every day what he called   skirmishes  but what the vanquished looked upon as terrible battles       The king of Sweden  before their departure from Warsaw  told Horatio   that all his officers were gallant men  and it was not his custom to   displace any one for meer favour to another  he must therefore wait till   the fate of war  or some other accident  made a vacancy  before he could   give him a commission  in the mean time  said he  with a great deal of   sweetness  you must be content to be only my aid de camp  On this   Horatio replied to his majesty  with as much politeness as sincerity    that it was the post he wished  tho  dare not presume to ask  for he   looked upon the honour of being near  and receiving the commands of so   excellent a monarch  preferable to the highest commission in the army       Thus  highly contented with his lot  did he attend the king  thro    rivers  lakes  marines  and all the obstacles nature had thrown in the   way of this conqueror  and whenever they came to any battle  was so   swift in bearing his commands to the general  and in returning to him in   which line soever he was  that Poniatosky gave him the name of the   Mercury to their Jove  nor did he less signalize his valour  he fought   by the side of the king like one who valued not life  in competition   with the praises of his master  In an engagement where they took the   baggage of Augustus  he did extraordinary service  and a colonel then   being killed on the spot  the king presently cried out  Now here is a   regiment for my Horatio  Our young warrior thanked him on his knees  but   beseeched he might not be removed from him  again protesting that he   could no were deserve so well  as where he was animated by his royal   presence  This Charles XII  took very kindly  and told him  he should   have his desire  but  said he  I must also have mine   I will continue   you my aid de camp  but you shall accept the commission  and the   lieutenant colonel shall command the regiment in your absence       He also allotted him so large a share in the prize taken in this battle    that Horatio was already become rich enough to avow his pretensions to   the daughter of the baron de Palfoy
