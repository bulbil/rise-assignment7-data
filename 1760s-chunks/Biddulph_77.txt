 his eyes sparkled with indignation  and his whole frame seemed agitated   Dear brother  said I  I conjure you   and I fell upon my knees and clasped both my arms around his  do not add to my affliction  by involving yourself and my husband in a fatal quarrel  What difference would it make to me  if Mr Arnold should fall  whether it is by your hand or Mr Faulkland’s  The loss would be the same  the misfortune  the publication of my disgrace  the same  Your husband  said he  breaking from me  though a little softened  would have as good a chance as I  if it came to the hazard  or perhaps he might condescend to take you again  if you will have it so   without coming to these extremities  if I am suffered to argue properly with him —I will not consent to your seeing him at all  said I  eagerly  The cause is now my own  he answered  coolly  but I will do nothing to aggravate your distress  I did not like the manner in which he spoke  My mother  who till now had been silent  caught the alarm  Let me intreat you  son  said she  to drop the thoughts of any violent methods with Mr Arnold  If you value your sister’s peace  or have any regard to the obedience you owe me  I insist on it  that you neither see him nor write to him  without our knowlege and consent  and if you do not promise me this  I renounce all ties of kindred or affection to you  your mother has as just a sense of the honour of her family as you    can have  but it is not on so hot a head  and so weak an arm  that she depends to see it justified to the world  Sir George  who was nettled at my mother’s spirited rebuke  made her a low bow  No doubt of it  madam  said he  there will be a miracle wrought in my sister’s favour  I would have you let her try the experiment of the ordeal  I dare say she would come off victorious  and then Mr Arnold would do you the favour to take her home again  I wish  said my mother  gravely  that there was a possibility of bringing my dear child’s innocence to such a proof  I would not hesitate a minute to put it to the trial  but since there is no such a thing now a days  I will wait till God  in his own righteousness  shall judge her cause  and clear her to the world  Therefore  son  I insist upon your promise before you leave me   I give you my word  madam  answered Sir George  I will not attempt to hold any conference with Mr Arnold without your knowlege  Will that satisfy you  It does  answered my mother  for I think I can rely upon your word  Sir George left us not very well satisfied with each other  his pride and resentment piqued to the highest  I cannot censure him for it here  he has cause  but the case is a nice and difficult one  The gratification of a private spleen ought not to enter into the measures he should pursue  Glad I am that my mother’s properly exerted resolution has tamed him a little  Though George sometimes fails in the respect which he owes her  yet I never knew him wilfully to disobey her commands  or oppose her inclinations  ’Tis well there is any hold on a disposition so ungentle and self willed as his   November 18  My brother has taken a very handsome house in Pall mall  and told my mother  between jest and earnest  he is going to give her a daughter in law  to make up for the loss of her son in law  He is  in reality  making his addresses to Lady Sarah P the daughter of a new created peer  She has a great fortune  he tells me  but I know nothing more of her  I wish him better success in his nuptials  if they take place  than I have had   November 20  Mr Arnold is arrived in town  he came late last night  and his man called this morning to enquire how I did  The poor fellow stole out before his master was up  and was afraid of staying a minute  lest he should be wanted at home  I called him up to the dining room  I saw    an honest shame and sorrow in his countenance  How does your master do  Frank  said I  Has he brought the children to town  No  madam  said he  but they are pure and hearty  I believe my master thought it a pity to bring them out of the fresh air  as long as Mrs Patty is there to look after them  They are better where they are  I asked him  was Mr Arnold come to town to make any stay  I believe for good and all  said he  This ugly law suit  to be sure  will detain him  but he is come alone  said he  with an intelligent nod  I don’t suppose
