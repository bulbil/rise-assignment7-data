I honoured with your love—May that  madam  be reserved for some fortunate man  whose merits are sufficient to justify your choice  and whose situation will not create any   86 impediments in the road of your happiness —Had I been destined for such a blessing —but why do I harrow up my own reflection  or wound your sensibility—I know the ineffable sweetness of that temper  and have seen numberless occasions where a tale of calamity has deluged it in tears —From an ungenerous lamentation  I shall therefore proceed to business  and  if I can but gain your acquiescence to a last request  the hand of death will lye light upon my brows  and I shall go out of the world in a comparative state of content     O  my dear mama  how I trembled at the solemnity  the tenderness of his manner—the dangerous extremity to which I saw him reduced  In short  as he himself phrased it  very happily the distresses of his mind  and the anguish of his wound  interested me so much in   87 his favour  that I never thought of interrupting him  but continued one passive hand all the time in his  the other being employed in holding up my handkerchief to my eyes  which were by this time quite red  and swollen with my emotion—After another pause to recover strength he thus went on   The request which I have to make  my dear Miss Beauclerk  may  perhaps  be inconsistent with your very refined notions of delicacy—but consider that some indulgences are due to your friends  and that I am entitled to your good wishes  though I have no claim to your love  by these wishes therefore  by the generosity of your temper  by all your regards in this world  and by all your hopes in the next  I conjure you to oblige me——O  Harriot  I would die for you  shew me therefore one little mark of   88 esteem  and  as a token of your friendship  only accept of this paper—It is an instrument which has been executed above two years  and  by all that s holy  whether you accept of it or not  it shall never be revoked   O  good God  my dear mama  it was his will  his—will—had the universe been offered me I could not touch it—my sensibility now became audible  I quite sobbed  yet  scarcely knowing what I did  I disengaged my hand from his  and  falling down upon my knees by the bed side  cried out    O spare me  Sir —spare me—this is too much—indeed it is   —At the same time sinking my face upon the bed cloaths  wholly unable to look up  as if I was conscious of some manifest impropriety—To be sure  madam  it was very wrong in me to let him see how much I was distressed—But what could I do—Consider   89 his tenderness for me  and then think of his melancholy situation  In short  my ever revered mama  consider also that I had sentiments of a softer nature than gratitude or friendship to occasion my agitation  and then you will be much more apt to pity than to condemn it     The colonel  madam  seemed greatly affected by my emotion  and  by endeavouring to assist me up  occasioned me to rise considerably sooner than what I would have done had he made use of the most earnest entreaties  for the moment I found him exerting himself to that purpose I recollected his wound  and was instantly in my former situation  notwithstanding my cheeks were visibly studded over with tears  and notwithstanding my perturbation was so excessive as to furnish a man of his fine sense with some reasonable suspicions of   90 the cause—Be this as it may  he pressed my hand to his lips with an air of inexpressible tenderness  and  apologizing for the uneasiness which he had given me  he continued to enforce his request with so much vehemence  and to declare in so positive a manner that he could never enjoy a moment s peace unless I gratified him in this point  that I told him I would consider the matter a little farther  and give him an answer in two or three days—   Two or three days  Harriot   replied he with a mixture of sorrow and surprize   Two or three days  Suppose that in this time I should be taken off—Your answer then will be a little of the latest  and I shall go out of the world without my principal consolation—The thing and the time require an immediate determination  and my reason for mentioning it to you at all  is to prevent the rashness of your   91 generosity —I know that  should I die without exacting a sacred promise from you to enjoy yourself this last little mark of my affection  you would think it an indispensable obligation to give every thing back to my family—But my family is already too rich for its own happiness  and  if I am to be removed  will have still less occasion for its extraordinary opulence—Promise  therefore  Harriot  solemnly promise  in the presence of that God  who sees with how aking a sense of tenderness I love you  that you will  according to the true purport of my request  accept of this
