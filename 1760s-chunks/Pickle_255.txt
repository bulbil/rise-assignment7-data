in all my excursions  and particularly in an expedition to Antwerp  with  two other gentlemen  where  in downright gaiete de coeur  we sat for  our pictures  which were drawn in one piece  one of the party being  represented in the dress of a hussar  and another in that of a running  footman  This incident I mention  because the performance  which is now  in my possession  gave birth to a thousand groundless reports circulated  in England at our expense    It was immediately after this jaunt that Lord R   began to disclose his  passion  though he  at the same time  started such objections as seemed  to extinguish his hopes  lamenting that  even if he should have the  happiness to engage my affections  his fortune was too inconsiderable  to support us against the efforts of Lord     should he attempt to  interrupt our felicity  and that he himself was obliged to follow the  motions of the army  In short  he seemed to consider my felicity more  than his own  and behaved with such delicacy  as gradually made an  impression on my heart  so that  when we parted  we agreed to renew our  correspondence in England    In the midst of these agreeable amusements  which I enjoyed in almost  all the different towns of Flanders  I happened to be at Ghent one day   sitting among a good deal of company  in one of their hotels  when a  post chaise stopped at the gate  upon which we went to the windows to  satisfy our curiosity  when who should step out of the convenience  but  my little insignificant lord  I no sooner announced him to the company   than all the gentlemen asked whether they should stay and protect me   or withdraw  and when I assured them that their protection was not  necessary  one and all of them retired  though Lord R   M   went no  farther than the parlour below  being determined to screen me against  all violence and compulsion  I sent a message to my lord  desiring him  to walk up into my apartment  but although his sole errand was to see  and carry me off  he would not venture to accept of my invitation   till he had demanded me in form from the governor of the place  That  gentleman  being altogether a stranger to his person and character   referred him to the commanding officer of the English troops  who was a  man of honour  and  upon his lordship s application  pretended to doubt  his identity  observing  that he had always heard Lord    represented    6 22 15  3 45 PM   as a jolly  corpulent man  He gave him to understand  however  that even  granting him to be the person  I was by no means subject to military  law  unless he could prove that I had ever listed in his Majesty s  service    Thus disappointed in his endeavours  he returned to the inn  and   with much persuasion  trusted himself in my dining room  after having  stationed his attendants at the door  in case of accidents  When I asked  what had procured me the honour of this visit  he told me  his business  and intention were to carry me home  This declaration produced a  conference  in which I argued the case with him  and matters were  accommodated for the present  by my promising to be in England some time  in September  on condition that he would permit me to live by myself  as  before  and immediately order the arrears of my pin money to be paid  He  assented to everything I proposed  returned in peace to his own country   and the deficiencies of my allowance were made good  while I returned  to Brussels  where I stayed until my departure for England  which I  regulated in such a manner as was consistent with my engagement    I took lodgings in Pall mall  and  sending for my lord  convinced him  of my punctuality  and put him in mind of his promise  when  to my utter  astonishment and confusion  he owned  that his promise was no more than  a decoy to bring me over  and that I must lay my account with living  in his house like a dutiful and obedient wife  I heard him with the  indignation such treatment deserved  upbraiding him with his perfidious  dealing  which I told him would have determined me against cohabitation  with him had I not been already resolved  and  being destitute of all  resource  repaired to Bath  where I afterwards met with Mr  D   and Mr   R    two gentlemen who had been my fellow passengers in the yacht from  Flanders  and treated me with great friendship and politeness  without  either talking or thinking of love    With these gentlemen  who were as idle as myself  I went to the jubilee  at Preston  which was no other than a great number of people assembled
