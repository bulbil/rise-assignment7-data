of marriage with a man she passionately loves  a woman  whose heart  by the consideration of the approaching union  and the exchange of a thousand tender vows that naturally antecede the ceremony  is melted into the softest degree of confidence  and thrown totally off its guard  such a woman  I say  if  in the unsuspecting moment of her soul  she even forgets   149 the more rigid  though necessary  punctilioes of behaviour  has infinite extenuations to offer in her defence  but if  upon her recovery of recollection  she is capable of acting with dignity and sentiment  the goodness of her mind I think sufficiently removes the imputation of levity  and renders her greatly superior to those who boast of their own fortitude  without experiencing the force of the same temptation   Thus  my dear Bob  have I opened my whole heart to you on this subject  and  now the only answer which I either desire or expect to this letter is  your immediate presence in town  to try every possible means of a reconciliation with Miss Mildmay—Don t be afraid of looking mean when you are about the performance of a good action  a blush upon such an occasion will become you mightily  and even in proportion to the   150 greatness of your confusion I shall be apt to estimate both the benevolence of your heart  and the depth of your understanding  should you  however  still continue attached to your ridiculous delicacy  and  through a romantic principle of pride give up a woman who is in actual possession of your heart  you must also give up a sister who loves you as sister  perhaps  never loved brother before  for  though I candidly own it will give me the greatest of all distresses to discontinue such a correspondence as should subsist betweeen two people so united by blood  and so cemented by friendship  yet I positively repeat  that  unless you shew yourself a man of principle on this important occasion  you will never more hear a syllable from your greatly afflicted  yet still affectionate Sister   THEO  HAVERSHAM     151  LETTER XI  Sir ROBERT HAROLD to CHARLES MELMOTH  Esq    Dear CHARLES   YOU can scarcely conceive the anxiety I have laboured under since my last letter  every moment that I was absent from Louisa  I thought would have enabled me to banish her from my memory with more readiness and certainty  but  I don t know how it is  she presses with an incessant violence to my recollection  and gains every moment an additional share of power in proportion as I flattered myself her power would have diminished  What an unaccountable fellow am I  Charles  that I never know my own mind for four and twenty hours together  Before I was sure of Miss Mildmay  I was impatient to   152 become master of her affections  when I had obtained these affections  I instantly sunk into a state of indifference and apathy  and for some time  dreaded the day of marriage as a condemned criminal would dread the day of execucution  Well  having at last worked myself up into a real passion for her  the intervention of an unexpected circumstance  induced me to give her up and  now that I have given her up  I find I shall be as eager as ever to regain her  The only way I see  after all  is fairly to marry her  for then  let me change my mind never so often  my person you know will be bound in such a manner as to keep me from the commission of fresh absurdities   I have just this moment received your letter  and my sister Haversham s  By these I find you are endeavouring to imitate  as far as you are capable of imitating    153 any thing worthy  the character of Belford in Richardson s Clarissa Harlow—Nay  to render this imitation the more striking  you treat me as if I were just such another contemptible blockhead as Lovelace  who did not imagine there was a modest woman existing  Now  you know very well  Melmoth  that I am rather vain in affectation than in reality  and  tho  I sometimes talk away about my person  and my address  you must acknowledge that  unlike Richardson s hero  I never insinuate that either is irresistable  In short  you know that  even in my wildest connection with the sex  I still retained some degree of principle  and have frequently  from motives of humanity  avoided an intercourse which he would have solicited with the utmost assidulty  Between him and I the comparison is still more remote  for he was continually endeavouring to undermine a virtue which he had no   154 reason whatsoever to suspect  whereas I never entertained a thought injurious to Miss Mildmay  but succeeded with her entirely from a trivial accident —This is not all  the arts which Lovelace made use of to trepan Clarissa  were to the last degree infamous and unmanly  his carrying her to Sinclair s  a common brothel  and his introduction of the two strumpets to her in the character of ladies of quality  are more flagrant instances of turpitude than if he had actually administered a sleeping draught  or forced her  the moment he got her from her
