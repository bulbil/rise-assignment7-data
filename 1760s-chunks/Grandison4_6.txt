me the above particulars  and upon enquiry  finding every thing to be as represented  I made myself acquainted with the widow Lady and her sons  And it was impossible to see them at their own house  and not respect the daughters for their amiable qualities   I desired them  when I was last down  to put into my hands their titles  deeds  and papers  which they have done  and they have been laid before counsel  who gi•e a very hopeful account of them   Being fully authoriz d by my Lord  I took leave of him over night  and set out early in the morning  directly   14 for Mansfield house  I arrived there soon after their breakfast was over  and was received by Lady Mansfield  her sons  who happened to be all at home  and her two daughters  with politeness   After some general conversation  I took Lady Mansfield aside  and  making an apology for my freedom  asked her  If Miss Mansfield were  to her knowlege  engaged in her affections   She answered  she was sure she was not  Ah  Sir  said she  a man of your observation must know  that the daughters of a decayed family of some note in the world  do not easily get husbands  Men of great fortunes look higher  Men of small must look out for wives to enlarge them  and men of genteel businesses are afraid of young women better born than portioned  Every body knows not that my girls can bend to their condition  and they must be contented to live single all their lives  and so they will choose to do  rather than not marry creditably  and with some prospect   I then opened my mind fully to her  She was agreeably surprised  But who  Sir  said she  would expect such a proposal from the next heir to Lord W    I made known to her how much in earnest I was in this proposal  as well for my Lord s sake  as for the young Lady s  I will take care  madam  said I  that Miss Mansfield  if she will consent to make Lord W  happy  shall have very handsome settlements  and such an allowance for pin money  as shall enable her to gratify every moderate  every reasonable  wish of her heart   Was it possible  she asked  for such an affair to be brought about  Would my Lord—There she stopt   I said  I would be answerable for him  And desired her to break the matter to her daughter directly   I left Lady Mansfield  and joined the brothers  who were with their two sisters  and soon after Miss Mansfield was sent for by her mother     15 After they had been a little while together  my Lady Mansfield sent to speak with me  They were both silent when I came in  The mother was at a loss what to say  The daughter was in still greater confusion   I addressed myself to the mother  You have  I perceive  madam  acquainted Miss Mansfield with the proposal I made to you  I am fully authorized to make it  Propitious be your silence  There never was  proceeded I  a treaty of marriage set on foot  that had not its conveniencies and inconveniencies  My Lord is greatly afflicted with the gout  There is too great a disparity in years These are the inconveniencies which are to be considered of for the lady   On the other hand  if Miss Mansfield can give into the proposal  she will be received by my Lord as a blessing  as one whose acceptance of him will lay him under an obligation to her  If this proposal could not have been made with dignity and honour to the lady  it had not come from me   The conveniencies to yourselves will more properly fall under the consideration of yourselves and family  One thing only I will suggest  that an alliance with so rich a man as Lord W  will make perhaps some people tremble  who now think themselves secure   But  madam  to the still silent daughter  let not a regard for me byass you  Your family may be sure of my best services  whether my proposal be received or rejected   My Lord  I must deal sincerely with you  has lived a life of error  He thinks so himself  I am earnest to have him see the difference  and to have an opportunity to rejoice with him upon it   I stopt  But both being still silent  the mother looking on the daughter  the dau hter glancing now and then her conscious eye on the mother  If  madam  said I  you can give your hand to Lord W  I will take care  that settlements shall exceed your expectation    16 What I have observed as well as heard of Miss Mansfield s temper and goodness  is the principal motive of my application to her  in preference to all the women I know   But permit me to say  that were your affections engaged to the lowest honest man on earth  I would not wish for your favour to my Lord W  And farther  if  madam
