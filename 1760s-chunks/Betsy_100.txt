 I received a        letter yesterday from Mr  Trueworth  he complains sadly of my        staying in the country  and seems to think my presence necessary        for the advancement of his courtship to you  I shall be always        glad to be obliged by you on any score  but extremely sorry to find        my interests with you  as a brother  should have more effect on you        than your own reason  and the merits of one of the most deserving        men on earth  I have no pretence to claim any authority over you by        the ties of blood  but may certainly flatter myself with having        some influence over you as a friend  enough  at least  I hope  to        prevail on you to consider seriously on this matter  and am        persuaded  that if you once bring yourself to do so  Mr  Trueworth        will want no other advocate to plead his cause than your own        understanding  I am willing to believe the assurance you gave me in        your last  of your heart being free from any impressions yet        endeavoured to be made upon it  did I think otherwise  I should be        entirely silent on this occasion  I would be far  my dear sister         from opposing your inclinations  I would only wish to direct them        where there is a prospect of the most felicity  Let me conjure you         therefore  to open your unprejudiced eyes  nor be wilfully blind to        the good intended for you by your better stars  As you can never        expect proposals of more advantage than those the love of Mr         Trueworth has inclined him to make you  I may be pretty confident         that you have not a friend in the world who would not highly        condemn your want of giving due attention to it  Forgive the warmth        with which I express myself  as it springs from the sincerest zeal        for the establishment of your interest and happiness  than which        nothing is more at the heart of him  who is  with the most tender        regard  dear sister  your very affectionate friend  and brother            F  THOUGHTLESS        While Miss Betsy was reading these letters  Miss Flora  who immediately   followed her into the chamber  would fain have interrupted her by one   impertinent question or another  but receiving no answer to any thing   she said  gave over speaking  and went directly to bed  and Miss Betsy   breaking open the third and last letter she had to peruse  found it   contained as follows             To Miss Betsy Thoughtless            My dear Miss Betsy            I had wrote to you before  if I had not been prevented by an        inflammation in my eyes  which  for some time past  has rendered my        pen of no use to me  and I did not chuse to employ an amanuensis in        what I have to say to you  but now take the first opportunity         being somewhat better  of giving you that advice  which  it may be        reasonably supposed  a person of your years and experience of the        world may stand in need of  or  if not so  will be of some service        in corroborating the good sentiments you are already inspired with            It was with an extreme concern I heard what happened on your        account at Oxford  and hope you have so well reflected on the        danger you were in  the consequences that attended it  and how much        worse might probably have ensued  as to be ever since more        circumspect and careful with what company you trust yourself  I am        far from reproaching you
