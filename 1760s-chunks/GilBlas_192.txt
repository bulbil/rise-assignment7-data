Samuel Simon  My friend  said I to the man who was complaining against that hawker of damaged goods  of what character is the strange fellow you are talking about  Of a confoundedly bad character  answered he in a pet  Depend on it  he is one of the most extortionate usurers in existence  though with the affectation of not letting his left hand know what his right gives away in charity  He was a Jew  and has turned Catholic  but rip your way into his heart if he has any  and you will find him still as inveterate a Jew as ever Pilate was  As for his conversion it was all in the way of trade   I took in with greedy ear the whole invective of the shop keeping declaimant  and failed not  on coming out of the eating house  to inquire for Samuel Simon s residence  A person directed me to the part of the town  and there was no difficulty in finding out the house  It was not enough to skim my eye cursorily over his shop  I peered into every hole and corner of it  and my imagination  always on the alert when any profit is to be picked up  has already engendered a rogue s trick  which only waits the period of gestation  when it may turn out a bantling not unworthy to be fathered by the sanctimonious servant of Signor Gil Blas  Straightway went I to the ready made warehouse  where I bought these dresses  into which we may stuff an inquisitor  a notary  and an alguazil  and play the parts in the spirit of the solemn offices they represent   Ah  my dear Ambrose  interrupted Don Raphael  transported with rapture at the suggestion  what a wonderful idea  a glorious scheme indeed  I am quite jealous of the contrivance  Willingly would I blot out the proudest quarter from my escutcheon  to have owned an effort of genius so transcendent  Yes  Lamela  I see  my friend  all the rich invention of the design  and you need be at no loss for instruments to carry it into effect  You want two good actors to play up to you  and you have not far to look for them  You have yourself a face that can look sanctified  magisterial  or blood thirsty at will  and may do very well to represent the inquisition  My character shall be that of the notary  and Signor Gil Blas  if he pleases  may enact the alguazil  Thus are the persons of the drama distributed  to  morrow we will play the piece  and I will pledge myself for its success  bating one of those unlucky chance medleys  which turn awry the currents of the most pithy and momentous enterprises   As yet Don Raphael s masterpiece of roguery had made but a clumsy impression on my plodding brain  but the argument of the fable was developed at supper time  and the hinge upon which it turned was  to my mind  of an ingenious contrivance  After having despatched part of our game  and bled our bottle to the last stage of evacuation  we stretched our length upon the grass  and soon fell fast asleep  Up with you  up with you  was the alarum of Signor Ambrose  as the day begun to dawn  People who have a great enterprise on hand ought not to indulge themselves in indolence  A plague upon you  master inquisitor  said Don Raphael  rubbing his eyes  you are confounded early on the move  It is as good as an order for execution to master Samuel Simon  Many a true word is spoken in jest  replied Lamela  Nay  you shall know more  added he with a sarcastic grin  I dreamt last night that I was plucking the hairs out of his beard  Was not that a left handed dream for him  master secretary  These pleasant hits were followed by a thousand others  which called forth new bursts of merriment  Our breakfast passed off with the utmost gaiety  and when it was over  we made our arrangements for the pageant we had got up  Ambrose arrayed himself in sables  as befitted so ghostly an instrument for the suppression of vice  We also took to our official habits  nor has the dignity of magistracy been often more gravely represented than by Don Raphael and myself  The making up of our persons was rather a tedious operation  for it was later than two o  clock in the afternoon when we sallied from the wood to attend our call at Xelva  It is true  there was no hurry  since the play was not to begin till the setting in of the evening  That being the case  we jogged on leisurely  and stopped at the gates of the town till the day was closed   At that eventful hour  we left our horses where they were  to the care of Don Alphonso  who was very well satisfied to have so humble a cast in the distribution  As for Don Raphael  Ambrose  and myself  our first visit was not to Samuel Simon in person  but to a tavern keeper who lived very near him  His reverence the inquisitor walked foremost  In went he to the bar  and said gravely to the landlord  Master  I want to
