think myself affronted by his stay   May 23  Now  now  my Cecilia  I can gratify your curiosity at full  he is come at last  Mr Faulkland  I mean  Orlando is come  we had a message from him this morning  to enquire after all our healths  he was just arrived at his house in the Square  Sir George flew to him directly  and said he would bring him without ceremony to take a family dinner  My mother bid him do so  and she held a quarter of an hour’s conference with her cook  She is always elegant and exact at her table  but we were more than ordinarily so to day  My brother brought Mr Faulkland a little before dinner time  and presented him to my mother and me  with that kind of freedom that almost look’d as if he were already one of the family   We had both been prepossessed highly in favour of his figure  a circumstance that seldom is of advantage to persons on their first appearance  but here it had not that effect  Sir George did not overrate the personal accomplishments of his friend  Now you’ll expect I should describe him to you  perhaps  and paint this romantic hero in the glowing colours of romantic exageration  But I’ll disappoint you—and tell you  that he is neither like an Adonis nor an Apollo—that he has no hyacinthine curls flowing down his back  no eyes like suns  whose brightness and majesty strike the beholders dumb  nor  in short  no rays of divinity about him  yet he is the handsomest mortal man that I ever saw —I will not say that his voice is harmony itself  and that all the loves and graces  for why should not there be male as well as female graces   attend on his motions  that Minerva presides over his lips  and every feature has its    attendant Cupid—But I will acknowlege that his voice in speaking is inexpressibly pleasing  you know how I admire an agreeable voice   that his air and motions are easy  genteel  and graceful  his conversation sensible and polite  and without the least tincture of affection  that thing  which of all others  would to me destroy the charms of an angel —In short  without hyperbole  that he is  what every one must allow  a perfectly handsome and accomplished young man   I never saw my mother appear so pleased with any one  The polite freedom of his address  the attention and deference he seemed to pay to her sentiments  and the dear good woman talked more to him  I think  than ever I heard her do to any one on so short an acquaintance   delighted her beyond expression  I bore no great part in the conversation  but was not  however  quite overlooked by Mr Faulkland  He referred to me in discourse now and then  and seemed pleased with me  at least I fancy’d so  My brother endeavoured to draw me out  as he said afterwards  The intention was kind  but poor Sir George is not delicate enough in those matters  I should have done better if he had let me alone  I thought of the conversations we had so often had about Mr Faulkland  and could not help considering myself like a piece of goods that was to be shewn to the best advantage to the purchaser  This reflection threw a sort of constraint over my behaviour  that  fool as I was  I had not courage enough to shake off  and I did not acquit myself at all to my own mind  I had  notwithstanding  the good fortune to please my mother infinitely  She told me  after our visitor was gone  that my behaviour had been strictly proper  and blamed Sir George for his wanting to engage me too often in conversation  You may assure yourself  son  she said  that a man of Mr Faulkland’s understanding will not like a young lady the worse for her silence  She spoke enough to shew that it was not for want of knowing what to say that she held her tongue  The man who does not reckon a modest reserve amongst the chief recommendations of a woman  should be no husband for Sidney  I am sure  when I married Sir Robert  he had never heard me speak twenty sentences  Sir George agreed with her as to the propriety of her observation  in regard to a modest reserve  but said  people now a days did not carry their ideas of it quite so far as they did when his father’s courtship began with her  and added  that a young lady might speak with as much modesty as she could hold her tongue   I did not interfere in the debate  only said  I was very glad to have    my mother’s approbation of my conduct  This put an end to the argument  and my mother launched out into high encomiums on Mr Faulkland  She said  upon her truth  he was the finest young man she ever saw  in every respect  So modest  so well bred  so very entertaining  and so unassuming  with all his fine accomplishments  She was quite astonished  and owned she almost despaired of finding a young gentleman  of the present mode of education
