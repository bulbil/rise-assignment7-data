concealed   himself  permit me to see to whom I am laying open my heart  and I shall   do it with pleasure     That cannot be   answered she   even for the   very reason you have alledged  I have something to confess to you  would   sink me into the earth with shame  did you behold the mouth that utters   it  In a word  I love you  and after having told you so  can you expect   I will reveal myself     Else how can I return the bounty as I ought     cried he   or you be assured you have not lavished your favours on an   insensible or ungrateful heart         Time may do much   said she   a longer and more free conversation with   you may perhaps embolden me to make a full discovery of my face to you    as I have already done of my heart   Mr  Trueworth then told her  that   the place they were in would allow but very few freedoms  and added    that if he were really so happy as she flattered him he was  she must   permit him to wait on her  where he might have an opportunity of   testifying the sense he had of so unhoped  and as yet so unmerited  a   blessing        Alas   cried she   I am quite a novice in assignations of this   sort  have so entire a dependance on your honour  that I dare meet you   any where  provided you give me your solemn promise not to take any   measures for knowing who I am  nor make any attempts to oblige me to   unmask  till I have assumed courage enough to become visible of my own   free will        Mr  Trueworth readily enough gave her the promise she exacted from him    not at all doubting but he should be easily able to find means to engage   her consent for the satisfaction of his curiosity in these points     Well  then   said she   it belongs to you to name a place proper for   these secret interviews        On this  after a little pause  he answered  that since she judged it   inconvenient for him to wait upon her at home  or any other place where   she was known  he would be about the close of day at a certain   coffee house  which he named to her   Where   continued he   I will   attend your commands  and on your condescending to stop at the door in a   hackney coach  will immediately come down and conduct you to a house   secure from all danger of a discovery   She hesitated not a moment to   comply with his proposal  yet  in the same breath she did so  affected   to be under some fears  which before she had not made the least shew   of  said  she hoped he would not abuse the confidence she reposed in   him  that he would take no advantage of the weakness she had shewn  that   though she loved him with the most tender passion  and could not have   lived without revealing it to him  yet her inclinations were innocent    and pure as those of a vestal virgin  and a great deal more stuff of   the like sort  which  though Mr  Trueworth could scarce refrain from   smiling at  yet he answered  with all the seriousness imaginable   I   should be unworthy  Madam  of the affection you honour me with  were I   capable of acting towards you in a manner unbecoming of you  or of   myself  and you may depend I shall endeavour to regulate my desires  so   as to render them agreeable to yours        After some farther discourse of the like nature  she rose up and took   her leave  insisting at parting  that he should not attempt to follow   her  or take any method to find out which way she went  which injunction   he punctually obeyed  not stirring from the bench till she was quite out   of sight       This adventure prodigiously amused him  never  in his whole life  had he   met with any thing he knew so little how to judge of  She had nothing of   the air of a woman of the town  and  besides  he knew it was not the   interest of those who made a trade of their favours  to dispense them in   the manner she seemed to intend  nor could he think her a person of the   condition and character her letter intimated  He could not conceive    that any of those he was acquainted with  would run such lengths for the   gratification of their passion
