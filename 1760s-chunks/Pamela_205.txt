his holy name          For ever shall accord          We walked in the garden till tea was ready  and as he went by the   back door  my master said to me  Of all the flowers in the garden  the   sun flower is the fairest   O  sir  said I  let that be now forgot    Mr  Williams heard him say so  and seemed a little out of countenance    Whereupon my master said  I mean not to make you serious  Mr  Williams    but we see how strangely things are brought about  I see other scenes   hereabouts  that  in my Pamela s dangers  give me more cause of concern    than any thing you ever did should give you  Sir  said he  you are very   generous       My master and Mr  Williams afterwards walked together for a quarter of   an hour  and talked about general things  and some scholastic subjects    and joined us  very well pleased with one another s conversation       Lady Jones said  putting herself on one side of me  as my master was on   the other  But pray  sir  when is the happy time to be  We want it over    that we may have you with us as long afterwards as you can  Said my   master  I would have it to morrow  or next day at farthest  if Pamela   will  for I have sent for a license  and the messenger will be here   to night  or early in the morning  I hope  But  added he  pray  Pamela    do not take beyond Thursday  She was pleased to say  Sure it will not be   delayed by you  madam  more than needs   Well  said he  now you are on   my side  I will leave you with her to settle it  and  I hope  she will   not let little bashful niceties be important with her  and so he joined   the two misses       Lady Jones told me  I was to blame  she would take upon her to say  if I   delayed it a moment  because she understood Lady Davers was very uneasy   at the prospect  that it would be so  and if any thing should happen  it   would be a sad thing   Madam  said I  when he was pleased to mention   it to me first  he said it should be in fourteen days  and afterwards    asked me if I would have it in the first or the second seven  I   answered  for how could I do otherwise   In the second  He desired it   might not be the last day of the second seven  Now  madam  said I  as   he was then pleased to speak his mind  no doubt  I would not  for any   thing  seem too forward       Well  but  said she  as he now urges you in so genteel and gentlemanly a   manner for a shorter day  I think  if I was in your place  I would agree   to it  She saw me hesitate and blush  and said  Well  you know best  but   I say only what I would do  I said  I would consider of it  and if I saw   he was very earnest  to be sure I should think I ought to oblige him       Misses Darnford were begging to be at the wedding  and to have a ball    and they said  Pray  Mrs  Andrews  second our requests  and we shall be   greatly obliged to you  Indeed  ladies  said I  I cannot promise that    if I might   Why so  said they   Because  answered I  I know not what    But I think one may  with pleasure  celebrate an anniversary of one s   nuptials  but the day itself  Indeed  ladies  I think it is too solemn a   business  for the parties of our sex to be very gay upon  it is a quite   serious and awful affair  and I am sure  in your own cases  you would be   of my mind  Why  then  said Miss Darnford  the more need one has to be   as light hearted and merry as one can       I told you  said my master  what sort of an answer you d have from   Pamela  The younger miss said  She never heard of such grave folks in   her life  on such an occasion  Why  sir  said she  I hope you ll sing   psalms all day  and miss will fast and pray  Such sackcloth and
