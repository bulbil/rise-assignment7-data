sleep with me  After this we set a while together  when having put his money in a canvas bag  into the pocket of his night gown  he took the candle and I followed him up to bed   How long I slept  I cannot exactly determine  but I conjecture it was about three o clock in the morning when I awakened with a violent cholic  I found my Chum awake as well as myself  he asked me what was the matter  I informed him  and at the same time begged he would direct me to the necessary  He told me  when I was down stairs  I must turn on my right hand  and go strait into the garden  at the end of which it was  just over the sea  but  adds he  you may possibly find some difficulty in opening the door  the string being broke which pulls up the latch  I will give you a penknife which you may open it with thro  a chink in the boards  So saying  he put his hand into his waistcoat pocket  which lay on him on the bed  and gave me a middling sized penknife   I hurried on a few of my cloaths  and went down stairs  but I must observe to you  that unclasping the penknife to open the door of the necessary  according to his direction  a piece of money which stuck between the blade and the groove in the handle fell into my hand  I did not examine what it was  nor Indeed could I well see  there being but a very faint moon light  so I put them together carelessly in my pocket   I apprehend I staid in the garden pretty near a quarter of an hour  When I returned to the chamber  I was surprized to find my bedfellow gone  I called several times but receiving no answer  I went to bed  and again fell asleep     5About six o clock I arose  nobody yet being up in the house  The gentleman was not yet returned to bed  or  if he was  had again left it  I drest myself with what haste I could  being impatient to see my sister  and the reckoning being paid over night  I let myself out at the street door   I will not trouble you with a relation of the kindness with which my sister and her husband received me  We breakfasted together  and I believe it might be about eleven o clock in the forenoon  when standing at the door my brother in law being by my side  we saw three horsemen galloping towards us  As soon as they came up to the house  they stopt and one of them lighting  suddenly seized me by the collar  crying  You are King s prisoner  I desired to know my crime  He said I should know that as soon as I came to Deal  where I must immediately go with them  One of them then told my brother that the night before I had committed a murder and robbery   Resistance would have proved as vain as my tears and protestations of my innocence  In a word  a warrant was produced  and I was carried back to Deal attended by the three men  my brother with another friend accompanying us  who knew not what to say for  nor how to comfort me   Being arrived in town I was immediately hurried to the house where I had slept the proceeding night the master of which was one of the three men that came to apprehend me  though in my first hurry I did not recollect him  We were met at the door by a crowd of people  every one crying  Which is he  which is he  As soon as I entered  I was accested by the publican s wife in tears  O  cursed wretch  what hast thou done  thou hast murdered and robbed   6 my poor dear uncle  and all through me who put thee to lie with him  But where hast thou hid his money and what hast thou done with his body  Thou shall be hanged on a gallows as high as a may pole  My brother begged her to be pacified  and I was taken into a private room  They then began to question me as the woman had done  about where I had put the money  and how I had disposed of the body  I asked them what money  and whose body they meant  They then said I had killed the person I had lain with the proceeding night  for the sake of a large sum I had seen with him  I fell down of upon my knees  calling God to witness  I knew nothing of what they accused me  Then somebody cried  Carry him up stairs  and I was brought into the chamber where I had slept  Here the man of the house went to the bed  and turning down the cloaths  shewed the sheets  pillow and bolster dyed in blood  He asked me did I know any thing of that  I declared to God I did not  Says a person in the room  Young man something very odd must have past here last night  for lying in the next chamber  I heard groanings  and going up and
