 though inconstant mistress  with a  religious exactness and punctuality  nor was she  for some time  less  observant of the agreement they had made  Nevertheless  she  by degrees   became so negligent and cold in her expression  and so slack in her  correspondence  that he could not help observing and upbraiding her with  such indifference  and her endeavours to palliate it were supported by  pretexts so frivolous  as to be easily seen through by a lover of very  little discernment    While he tortured himself with conjectures about the cause of this  unexpected change  he received such intelligence from England  as  when  joined with what he himself had perceived by her manner of writing   left him little or no room to doubt of her fickleness and inconstancy   Nevertheless  as he knew by experience that informations of that kind  are not to be entirely relied upon  he resolved to be more certainly  apprised  and  for that end  departed immediately for London  by the  way of Tyrol  Bavaria  Alsace  and Paris  On his arrival in England  he  learned  with infinite concern  that his intelligence had not been  at all exaggerated  and his sorrow was inexpressible to find a person  endowed with so many other noble and amiable qualities  seduced into  an indiscretion  that of necessity ruined the whole plan which had been  concerted between them for their mutual happiness  She made several  attempts  by letters and interviews  to palliate her conduct  and soften  him into a reconciliation  but his honour being concerned  he remained  deaf to all her entreaties and proposals  Nevertheless  I have often  heard him say  that he could not help loving her  and revering the  memory of a person to whose generosity and goodness he owed his fortune   and one whose foibles were overbalanced by a thousand good qualities  He  often insisted on making restitution  but far from complying with that  proposal  she afterwards often endeavoured to lay him under yet greater  obligations of the same kind  and importuned him with the warmest  solicitations to renew their former correspondence  which he as often  declined    M   took this instance of the inconstancy of the sex so much to  heart  that he had almost resolved for the future to keep clear of all  engagements for life  and returned to Paris  in order to dissipate his  anxiety  where he hired an apartment in one of the academies  in the  exercises whereof he took singular delight  During his residence at  this place  he had the good fortune to ingratiate himself with a  great general  a descendant of one of the most ancient and illustrious  families in France  having attracted his notice by some remarks he had  written on Folard s Polybius  which were accidentally shown to that  great man by one of his aides de camp  who was a particular friend of  M    The favour he had thus acquired was strengthened by his assiduities  and attention  Upon his return to London  he sent some of Handel s  newest compositions to the prince  who was particularly fond of that    6 22 15  3 45 PM   gentleman s productions  together with Clark s edition of Caesar  and   in the spring of the same year  before the French army took the field   he was honoured with a most obliging letter from the prince  inviting  him to come over  if he wanted to see the operations of the campaign   and desiring he would give himself no trouble about his equipage    M   having still some remains of a military disposition  and this to be  a more favourable opportunity than any he should ever meet with again   readily embraced the offer  and sacrificed the soft delights of love   which at that time he enjoyed without control  to an eager  laborious   and dangerous curiosity  In that and the following campaign  during  which he was present at the siege of Philipsburgh  and several other  actions  he enlarged his acquaintance among the French officers   especially those of the graver sort  who had a taste for books and  literature  and the friendship and interest of those gentlemen were  afterwards of singular service to him  though in an affair altogether  foreign from their profession  He had all along made diligent inquiry  into the trade and manufactures of the countries through which he had  occasion to travel  more particularly those of Holland  England  and  France  and  as he was well acquainted with the revenue and farms of  this last kingdom  he saw with concern the great disadvantages under  which our tobacco trade  the most considerable branch of our commerce  with that people  was carried on  what inconsiderable returns were made  to the planters  out of the low price given by the French company  and  how much it was in the power of that company to reduce it still lower   M   had formed a scheme to remedy this evil  so far as it related to the  national loss
