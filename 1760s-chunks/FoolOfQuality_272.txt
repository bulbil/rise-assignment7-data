my concern  and was a man of vast opulence  but a stranger   among us at that time      Though Sir Freestone was an old bachelor  and had one of the   most remorseless hearts that ever informed the shape of man  he   had yet a pleasing aspect and insinuating address  and always   applied those qualities to the purpose of betraying  Alas   I was   informed  but too late  of his character that his avarice outgrew   even the growth of his wealth   and that his desires increased in   exact proportion as age happened to deduct from his ability to   gratify them      Unhappily he cast a greedy eye at iny little farm  Like another   lordly Ahab  he coveted the vineyard of poor Naboth   and at   length compassed his ends by means equally iniquitous      When he proposed to give me more than value for it  I an    swered that I myself had taken a fancy to it  for the sake of the   dear man who had given it to me in trust for his child and her     u2         292 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      posterity  and that I would not part with it for twenty times an   equivalent  With this  however  he did not appear in the least   disconcerted   but said that he esteemed and affected me the more   for my gratitude to the memory of my old benefactor      I was afterwards told  and learned by dear experience  that he   never pardoned an offence  nor even a disappointment   but nothing   of this appeared for the present  He visited made it his business   to meet me in several places sought and seemed quite desirous   of cultivating an acquaintance with me did me many little friendly   offices with my richer neighbours condescended to toy with my   little ones appeared to take a huge liking to my two eldest   boys stood godfather to my little girl that is now in her mother s   arms said he wondered how I contrived to maintain so numerous   a family upon such slender means and promised to procure me a   beneficial post in the collection of the customs      After a course of such specious kindnesses  and while my heart   glowed with gratitude  in the recollection of his favours both passed   and proposed  he came to my house in a mighty hurry  My dear   Homely  says he  I have just struck up a most advantageous bargain   with our neighbour  Squire Spendall  But he wants the money   immediately I have not the whole about me   and yet  if I do not   pay him down directly  some cursed disappointment may intervene    Do run and bring me all that you have quickly  I will repay   you within two or three days at farthest      Here I hasted with joy to the corner where I had deposited my   cash  as well for payment of rent as another little matter that   I had in my eye   and  bringing out a leathern bag  I laid it on the   table  There  sir  said I  are two hundred and thirty guineas     take but the trouble to count them out  and give me a short   acknowledgment  No  said he  my dear Homely  never heed it for   the present  I will be back with you the moment I have paid the   purchase   and so saying  he caught up the bag and huddled away   as fast as his old legs could scamper  while I sat still through   astonishment  my heart misgiving me at the time  as if it foreboded   the mischiefs that were to follow      I waited with great anxiety for his return till evening  when    hastening to his lodge  I was there informed that he had set out   for London five hours before  This threw me into a panic  though   not altogether without a mixture of hope  and so I waited till the   three days of his promise should expire  Mr  Snack then came   to me and demanded the rent  He was a Lincoln attorney  whom   Lord Lechmore had lately preferred to the care of my landlord s   concerns  upon the death of Mr  Kindly  the good old agent  I told   him ingenuously how matters had happened  and said I would   hurry to London and bring back the money directly      Accordingly I posted away  and rested not till I arrived at the   great city  There  for seven days successively  I besieged the   doors of Sir Freestone  hourly knocking and requesting to be   admitted to his presence   but he was either not up  or just gone   out
