came  but brought no billet from that once obsequious lover    the next  and three or four succeeding ones  were barren of the fruit   she so much expected  What judgment could she form of an event so odd    She could not bring herself to think Saving had taken pains to procure a   rendezvous with her  on purpose to disappoint and affront her  and was   not able to conceive any probable means by which he could be prevented   from writing to her  Death only  she thought  could be an excuse for   him  and had that happened she should have heard of it  Sometimes she   fancied that the maid had been treacherous  but when she considered she   could get nothing by being so  and that it was  on the contrary  rather   her interest to be sincere  she rejected that supposition  The various   conjectures  which by turns came into her head  rendered her  however    excessively disturbed  and in a situation which deserved some share of   pity  had not her pride kept her from revealing the discontent  or the   motives of it  to any one person in the world                CHAPTER V       Contains nothing very extraordinary  yet such things as are highly   proper to be known          I think it is generally allowed that there are few emotions of the mind   more uneasy than suspense  Not the extreme youth of Miss Betsy  not all   her natural cheerfulness  nor her perfect indifference for the son of   Alderman Saving  could enable her to throw off the vexation in which his   late behaviour had involved her  had the motive been the most mortifying   of any that could be imagined to her vanity  pride and resentment would   then have come to her assistance  she would have despised the author of   the insult  and in time have forgot the insult itself  but the   uncertainty in what manner she ought to think of the man  and this last   action of his  made both dwell much longer on her mind than otherwise   they would have done  As the poet truly says             When puzzling doubts the anxious bosom seize        To know the worst  is some degree of ease        This is a maxim which will hold good  even when the strongest and most   violent passions operate  but Miss Betsy was possessed of no more than a   bare curiosity  which as she had as yet no other sensation that demanded   gratification  was sufficiently painful to her       It was about ten or twelve days that she continued to labour under this   dilemma  but  at the expiration of that time  was partly relieved from   it by the following means       Mr  Goodman  happening to meet Alderman Saving  with whom he had great   business  upon Change  desired he would accompany him to an adjacent   tavern  to which the other complied  but with an air much more grave and   reserved than he was accustomed to put on with a person whom he had   known for a great number of years  and was concerned with in some   affairs of traffick  they went together to the Ship Tavern       After having ended what they had to say to each other upon   business   Mr  Goodman   said the alderman   we have long been friends    I always thought you an honest  fair dealing man  and am therefore very   much surprized you should go about to put upon me in the manner you have   lately done     Put upon you  Sir   cried the merchant   I know not what   you mean  and am very certain I never did any thing that might call in   question my integrity  either to you or to any one else     It was great   integrity  indeed   resumed the alderman  with a sneer   to endeavour to   draw my only son into a clandestine marriage with the girl you have at   your house   Mr  Goodman was astonished  as well he might  at this   accusation  and perceiving  by some other words that the alderman let   fall  that he was well acquainted with the love young Saving had   professed for Miss Betsy  frankly related to him all that he knew of the   courtship  and the method he had taken to put a stop to it   That was   not enough  Sir   cried the alderman  hastily   you should have told me   of it  Do you think young folks  like them  would have regarded your   forbidding  No
