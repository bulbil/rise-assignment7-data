 her being persecuted with the impertinencies of some people there  who   she found thought a masque a kind of sanction for saying any thing       It is not to be doubted but Horatio gave her all the assurances that   words could form  of feeling the most perfect pleasure in her society    and that he should not  without the extremest reluctance  find himself   obliged to abandon the happiness she offered him to any other person in   the company  to recompence this complaisance  as she called it  she gave   him a brief detail of the characters of as many as she knew thro  their   habits  and in doing this discovered a sweet impartiality and love of   truth  which was no small addition to her other charms  She blamed the   baroness de Guiche for not being able to return the affection of a   husband who had married her with an inconsiderable fortune  and had   since she had been his wife pardoned a thousand miscarriages in her   conduct   she praised the virtue of mademoiselle de Mareau  who being at   fifteen the bride of a man of seventy  behaved to him with a tenderness    and exact conformity to his will  which  if owing alone to duty  was not   to be distinguished from inclination   she expressed a concern that the   gaity of the dutchess of Vendome gave the world any room for censure    and highly condemned the duke for being guilty of actions which had made   her sometimes give into parties of pleasure by way of retaliation   but   she was more severe on the indecorum of mademoiselle de Renville  who   being known for the mistress of the duke of Chartres  and that she was   supported by him  was fond of appearing in all public places  She could   not help testifying a good deal of surprize  that any woman who   pretended to virtue would admit her into their assemblies  not but she   said the case of that lady was greatly to be pitied  who being high born   and bred had been reduced to the lowest exigencies of life  and from   which to be relieved she had only consented to assist the looser   pleasures of the amorous duke  but  added she  I would not methinks have   her seem to glory in her shame  and in a manner of life which her   misfortunes alone can render excusable  nor can I approve of the   indulgence her mistaken triumph meets with  because it may not only   destroy all notions of regret in herself for what her necessities oblige   her to  but also make others  who have not the same pretence  find a   kind of sanction for their own errors   vice  said she  ought at lead to   blush  and hide itself as much as possible from view  left by being   tolerated in public it should become a fashion       Horatio was so much taken up with admiring the justness of her   sentiments  that awed by them  as it were  he could not yet  tho    mask d  make any discovery of his own  she was about entering into a   discourse with him concerning the first motives which had rendered some   persons she pointed out to him unhappy in the marriage state  which   perhaps might have given him an opportunity for explaining himself  when   a lady richly dress d came up to them  and giving Horatio a sudden pluck   by the arm  villain  cried she  Madam  returned he  strongly amazed  Is   the trifling conversation of Sanserre  resumed she  or this little   creature to be preferred to a woman of that quality you have dared to   abuse   but this night has convinced her of your perfidy   she sends you   this  continued she  giving him a slap over the face as hard as she   could  and be assured it is the last present you will ever receive   from her       She had no sooner uttered these words than she flew quick as lightning   out of the room  leaving Horatio in such a consternation both at what   she said and did  as deprived him even of the thought of following her    or using any means to solve this riddle   He was in a deep musing when   mademoiselle Charlotta  possessed that moment with a passion she till   then was ignorant of  said to him  I find  Horatio  you have wonderfully   improved the little time you have been in France  to gain you a   multiplicity of mistresses  but I am sorry my inadvertency in talking to   a man so doubly pre engaged  should cause me to be reckoned among the   number  In speaking this she turned away with a confusion which was   visible in her air  and the scarlet colour with which her neck was dyed
