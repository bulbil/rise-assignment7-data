who made themselves masters of fort St  Joseph  the faschine batteries  and one Spanish man of war  the other three being burnt or sunk by the foe  that they might not fall into our hands —The taking of these forts  in the strength of which the Spaniards chiefly confided  made us masters of the outward harbour  and occasioned great joy among us  as we laid our accounts with finding little or no opposition from the town  And indeed  if a few great ships had sailed up immediately  before they had recovered from the confusion and despair that our unexpected success had produced among them  it is not impossible that we might have finished the affair to our satisfaction  without any more blood shed  but this our Heroes disdained  as a barbarous insult over the enemy s distress  and gave them all the respite they could desire  in order to recollect themselves —In the mean time  Mackshane taking the advantage of this general exultation  waited on our captain  and pleaded his own cause so effectually  that he was re established in his good graces  and as for Crampley  there was no more notice taken of his behaviour towards me  during the action —But of all the   291 consequences of the victory  none was more grateful than plenty of fresh water  after we had languished five weeks on the allowance of a purser s quart per diem for each man  in the Torrid Zone  where the sun was vertical  and the expence of bodily fluid so great  that a gallon of liquor could scarce supply the waste of twentyfour hours  especially  as our provision consisted of putrid salt beef  to which the sailors gave the name of Irish horse  salt pork of New England  which though neither fish nor flesh  savoured of both  bread from the same country  every biscuit whereof  like a piece of clock work  moved by its own internal impulse  occasioned by the myriads of insects that dwelt within it  and butter served out by the gill  that tasted like train oil thickened with salt  Instead of small beer  each man was allowed three half quarterns of brandy or rum  which was distributed every morning  diluted with a certain quantity of his water  without either sugar or fruit to render it palatable  for which reason this composition  was by the sailors not unaptly stiled Necessity  Nor was this limitation of simple element owing to a scarcity of it on board  there being at this time water enough in the ship for a voyage of six months  at the rate of half a gallon per day to each man  But this fast must  I suppose  have been injoined by way of pennance on the ship s company for their sins  or rather with a view to mortify them into a contempt of life  that they might thereby become more resolute and regardless of danger  How simply then do those people argue  who ascribe the great mortality among us  to our bad provision and want of water    292 and affirm  that a great many valuable lives might have been saved  if the useless transports had been employed in fetching fresh stock  turtle  fruit  and other refreshments  from Jamaica and other adjacent islands  for the use of the army and fleet  seeing  it is to be hoped  that those who died went to a better place  and those who survived were the more easily maintained —After all  a sufficient number remained to fall before the walls of St  Lazar  where they behaved like their own country mastifs  which shut their eyes  run into the jaws of a bear  and have their heads crushed for their valour   But to return to my narration  After having put garrisons into the forts we had taken  and re imbarked our soldiers and artillery  which detained us more than a week  we ventured up to the mouth of the inner harbour  guarded by a large fortification on one side  and a small redoubt on the other  both of which were deserted before our approach  and the entrance of the harbour blocked up by several old galleons that the enemy had sunk in the channel —We made shift  however  to open a passage for some ships of war  that favoured the second landing of our troops at a place called La Quinta  not far from the town  where  after a faint resistance from a body of Spaniards  who opposed their disembarkation  they encamped with a design of besieging the castle of St  Lazar  which overlooked and commanded the city  Whether our renowned general had no body in his army who knew how to approach it in form  or that he trusted intirely to the fame of his arms  I shall not determine  but certain it is  a resolution was taken in   293 a council of war  to attack the place with musquetry only  which was put in execution  and succeeded accordingly  the enemy giving them such an hearty reception  that the greatest part of the detachment took up their everlasting residence on the spot —Our chief not relishing this kind of complaisance in the Spaniards  was wise enough to retreat on board with the remains of his army  which  from eight thousand able men landed on the beach near Bocca Chica
