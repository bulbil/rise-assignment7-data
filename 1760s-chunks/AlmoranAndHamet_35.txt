for   ever  in the sacred and inviolable stores of the past  and place them   beyond the power not of ALMORAN only but of fate   With this wild   effusion of desire  he caught her again to his breast  and finding no   resistance his heart exulted in his success  but the next moment  to the   total disappointment of his hopes  he perceived that she had fainted in   his arms  When she recovered  she once more disengaged herself from him    and turning away her face  she burst into tears  When her voice could be   heard  she covered herself with her veil  and turning again towards him     All but this   said she   I had learnt to bear  and how has this been   deserved by ALMEIDA of HAMET  You was my only solace in distress  and   when the tears have stolen from my eyes in silence and in solitude  I   thought on thee  I thought upon the chaste ardour of thy sacred   friendship  which was softened  refined  and exalted into love  This was   my hoarded treasure  and the thoughts of possessing this  soothed all my   anguish with a miser s happiness  who  blest in the consciousness of   hidden wealth  despises cold and hunger  and rejoices in the midst of   all the miseries that make poverty dreadful  this was my last retreat    but I am now desolate and forlorn  and my soul looks round  with terror    for that refuge which it can never find    Find that refuge   said   ALMORAN   in me    Alas   said ALMEIDA   can he afford me refuge from my   sorrows  who  for the guilty pleasures of a transient moment  would   forever sully the purity of my mind  and aggravate misfortune by the   consciousness of guilt        As ALMORAN now perceived  that it was impossible  by any importunity  to   induce her to violate her principles  he had nothing more to attempt    but to subvert them   When   said he   shall ALMEIDA awake  and these   dreams of folly and superstition vanish  That only is virtue  by which   happiness is produced  and whatever produces happiness  is therefore   virtue  and the forms  and words and rites  which priests have pretended   to be required by Heaven  are the fraudful arts only by which they   govern mankind        ALMEIDA  by this impious insult  was roused from grief to indignation     As thou hast now dared   said she   to deride the laws  which thou   wouldst first have broken  so hast thou broken for ever the tender   bonds  by which my soul was united to thine  Such as I fondly believed   thee  thou art not  and what thou art  I have never loved  I have loved   a delusive phantom only  which  while I strove to grasp it  has vanished   from me   ALMORAN attempted to reply  but on such a subject  neither her   virtue nor her wisdom would permit debate   That prodigy   said she     which I thought was the sleight of cunning  or the work of sorcery  I   now revere as the voice of Heaven  which  as it knew thy heart  has in   mercy saved me from thy arms  To the will of Heaven shall my will be   obedient  and my voice also shall pronounce  to ALMORAN ALMEIDA        ALMORAN  whose whole soul was now suspended in attention  conceived new   hopes of success  and foresaw the certain accomplishment of his purpose    though by an effect directly contrary to that which he had laboured to   produce  Thus to have incurred the hatred of ALMEIDA in the form of   HAMET  was more fortunate than to have taken advantage of her love  the   path that led to his wishes was now clear and open  and his marriage   with ALMEIDA in his own person  waited only till he could resume it  He    therefore  instead of soothing  provoked her resentment   If thou hast   loved a phantom   said he   which existed only in imagination  on such a   phantom my love also has been fixed  thou hast  indeed  only the form of   what I called ALMEIDA  my love thou hast rejected  because thou hast   never loved  the object of thy passion was not HAMET  but a throne  and   thou hast made the observance of rituals  in which folly only can   suppose there is good or ill  a pretence to violate thy faith  that thou   mayst still gratify thy ambition        To this injurious reproach  ALMEIDA made no reply
