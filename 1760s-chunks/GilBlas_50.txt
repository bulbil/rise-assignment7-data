me more than I wanted to know  She informed me  or rather I inferred it from her artless simplicity  that her good aunt had a good friend  who lived likewise with an old canon  The temporalities of the church were under his administration  and these lucky domestics reckoned upon entwining the spoils of their masters round the pillars of the hymeneal temple  into whose sanctuary they had penetrated by anticipation  Dame Jacintha  as I have said before  though a little stricken in years  had still some bloom  To be sure  she spared no pains to cherish it  besides daily evacuations  she took plentiful doses of all powerful jelly  She got her sleep in the night too  while I sat up with my master  But what perhaps contributed most to the freshness of this everlasting flower  was an issue in each leg  of which I should never have known  but for that blab Inésilla     CH  II     The canon s illness  his treatment  the consequence  the legacy to Gil Blas   I STAID three months with the Licentiate Sédillo  without complaining of bad nights  At the end of that time he fell sick  The distemper was a fever  and it inflamed the gout For the first time in his life  which had been long  he called in a physician  Doctor Sangrado was sent for  the Hippocrates of Valladolid  Dame Jacintha was for sending for the lawyer first  and touched that string  but the patient thought it was time enough  and had a little will of his own upon some points  Away I went therefore for Doctor Sangrado  and brought him with me  A tall  withered  wan executioner of the sisters three  who had done all their justice for at least these forty years  This learned forerunner of the undertaker had an aspect suited to his office  his words were weighed to a scruple  and his jargon sounded grand in the ears of the uninitiated  His arguments were mathematical demonstrations  and his opinions had the merit of originality   After studying my master s symptoms  he began with medical solemnity  The question here is  to remedy an obstructed perspiration  Ordinary practitioners  in this case  would follow the old routine of salines  diuretics  volatile salts  sulphur and mercury  but purges and sudorifics are a deadly practice  Chemical preparations are edged tools in the hands of the ignorant  My methods are more simple  and more efficacious  What is your usual diet  I live pretty much upon soups  replied the canon  and eat my meat with a good deal of gravy  Soups and gravy  exclaimed the petrified doctor  Upon my word  it is no wonder you are ill  High living is a poisoned bait  a trap set by sensuality  to cut short the days of wretched man  We must have done with pampering our appetites  the more insipid  the more wholesome  The human blood is not a gravy  Why then you must give it such a nourishment as will assimilate with the particles of which it is composed  You drink wine  I warrant you  Yes  said the licentiate  but diluted  Oh  finely diluted  I dare say  rejoined the physician  This is licentiousness with a vengeance  A frightful course of feeding  Why  you ought to have died years ago  How old are you  I am in my sixty ninth year  replied the canon  So I thought  quoth the practitioner  a premature old age is always the consequence of in temperance  If you had only drank clear water all your life  and had been contented with plain food  boiled apples for instance  you would not have been a martyr to the gout  and your limbs would have performed their functions with lubricity  But I do not despair of setting you on your legs again  provided you give yourself up to my management  The licentiate promised to be upon his good behaviour   Sangrado then sent me for a surgeon of his own choosing  and took from him six good porringers of blood  by way of a beginning  to remedy this obstinate obstruction  He then said to the surgeon  Master Martin Onez  you will take as much more three hours hence  and to morrow you will repeat the operation  It is a mere vulgar error  that the blood is of any use in the system  the faster you draw it off the better  A patient has nothing to do but to keep himself quiet  with him  to live is merely not to die  he has no more occasion for blood than a man in a trance  in both cases  life consists exclusively in pulsation and respiration  When the doctor had ordered these frequent and copious bleedings  he added a drench of warm water at very short intervals  maintaining that water in sufficient quantities was the grand secret in the materia medica  He then took his leave  telling Dame Jacintha and me  with an air of confidence  that he would answer for the patient s life  if his system was fairly pursued  The housekeeper  though protesting secretly against this new practice  bowed to his superior authority  In fact  we set on the kettles in a hurry
