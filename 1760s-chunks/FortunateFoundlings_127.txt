when he heard the vast journey she had come on foot  he was in the   utmost amazement at her fortitude  and told her he was resolved to keep   her pilgrim s habit as a relique  to preserve to after ages the memory   of an adventure  which had really something more marvellous in it than   many set down as miracles       And now having fully gratified his own curiosity in all he wanted to be   informed of  he thought proper to case the impatience she was in to know   the history of her birth  and on what occasion it had been so long   concealed  which he did in these or the like words             CHAP  XXIV        The history of Dorilaus and Matilda  with other circumstances very   important to Louisa        You know  said he  that I am descended of one of the most illustrious   families in England  tho   by some imprudencies on the one side  and   injustice on the other  my claim was set aside  and I deprived of that   title which my ancestors for a long succession of years had enjoyed  so   that the estate I am in possession of  was derived to me in right of my   mother  who was an heiress  It is indeed sufficient to have given me a   pretence to any lady I should have made choice on  and to provide for   what children I might have had by her  but the pride of blood being not   abated in me by being cut off from my birthright  inspired me with an   unconquerable aversion to marriage  since I could not bequeath to my   posterity that dignity I ought to have enjoyed myself   I resolved   therefore to live single  and that the misfortune of my family should   dye with myself       In my younger years I went to travel  as well for improvement  as to   alleviate that discontent which was occasioned by the sight of another   in possession of what I thought was my due   Having made the tour of   Europe  I took France again in my way home   the gallantry and good   breeding of these people very much attached me to them  but what chiefly   engaged my continuance here much longer than I had done in any other   part  was an acquaintance I had made with a lady called Matilda  she was   of a very good family in England  was sent to a monastry merely for the   sake of well grounding her in a religion  the free exercise of which is   not allowed at home  and to seclude her from settling her affections on   any other than the person she was destined to by the will of her   parents  and to whom she had been contracted in her infancy   she was   extremely young  and beautiful as an angel  and the knowledge she was   pre engaged  could not hinder me from loving her  any more than the   declarations I made in her hearing against marriage  could the grateful   returns she was pleased to make me   in fine  the mutual inclination we   had for each other  as it rendered us deaf to all suggestions but that   of gratifying it  so it also inspired us with ingenuity to surmount all   the difficulties that were between our wishes and the end of them   Tho    a pensioner in a monastry  and very closely observed  by the help of a   confidant she frequently got out  and many nights we passed   together   till some business relating to my estate at length calling me   away  we were obliged to part  which we could not do without testifying   a great deal of concern on both sides   mine was truly sincere at that   time  and I have reason to believe her s was no less so  but absence   easily wears out the impressions of youth  as I never expected to see   her any more  I endeavoured not to preserve a remembrance which would   only have given me disquiet  and  to confess the truth  soon forgot both   the pleasure and the pain I had experienced in this  as well as some   other little sallies of my unthinking youth       Many years passed over without my ever hearing any thing of her  and it   was some months after I received your letter from Aix la Chappelle  that   the post brought me one from Ireland  having no correspondence in that   country  I was a little surprized  but much more when I opened it and   found it contained these words        To  DORILAUS       SIR           This comes to make a request  which I
