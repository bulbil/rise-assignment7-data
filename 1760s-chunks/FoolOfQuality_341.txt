 During the three following weeks  though confined to my bed  I   was permitted to sit up  and my wounds  though not skinned  were   healing apace  What happiness did I enjoy during that ecstatic   interval  The maternal and filial angels scarce ever left my   side  One morning  when I just awoke from a terrifying dream    they both entered with peace  and comfort  and healing in their   countenances      What is the matter  my Harry   said my lady   your face does   not seem composed to that fortitude and complacence which is   seated in your heart  Ah  madam   I cried  I have been all night   tormented with the most alarming and horrible visions I ever   had in my life  Three times I dreamed successively that my   Louisa and I were walking hand in hand through the fields of   Elysium  or on the banks of Meander  or in the gardens of   Alcinous  gazing and drinking in large draughts of love from each   other  when at one time a huge and tremendous dragon  at   another a sudden earthquake  and at another an impetuous   hurricane came  and caught and severed us far asunder      But my visions  my honest friend  said the heavenly smiling   Louisa  have been of a very different nature  I dreamed that    while we were standing on the bank of a frightful precipice toge    ther  your Matilda descended  all celestial  and a thousand times   more lovely than she appears in the lovely portrait that you carry   about you  At first I feared that she came to reclaim you to   herself  but instead of that she smiled upon me  and began to   caress me  and taking my right hand she put it into yours  Then    ascending in her brightness  she hovered a while on high  and cast    ing down upon me a look of fixed love  she gave me a beck with   her hand  as it were to follow  and was immediately lost in glory      O  my dear children   cried the marchioness  for such she was     might I but once see you united  how I should lift my head   or    rather  how satisfied I should be to lay it down in peace  having   nothing further to care for on this side of eternity       That night I slept sounder than usual  and did not awake till   the day was something advanced  On opening the curtain I saw         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  877     J  t mes seated in a moody posture by the side of my bed  How are   the ladies  James   said I  Gone  sir  Gone  gone   I cried out    Yes  sir  gone indeed   but with very heavy hearts  and both of them   drowned in tears  Here has been a large body of the gens d armes   sent for them  so that there was no resisting  Poor Gerard went   on his knees to his lady to beg permission to throw himself at your   honoured feet  as he said  and to bid you adieu  but she would not   allow him  Mean time she charged me with this watch and ring    and this letter for your honour      I catched at the letter  and tearing it open  read over and over    a thousand times  what will for ever be engraven in my memory   and on my heart         We leave you we leave you  most beloved of men  and we are   miserable in so doing   but alas   we are not our own mistresses    My lord  for this time  has proved unjust and ungrateful   and re    fuses your Louisa  as well to my prayers as to your infinite merits    He has affianced her  as it seems  to a prince of the blood  and his   ambition has blinded him to all other considerations  Be not   yet in despair  we shall exert our very utmost to get this injurious   sentence reversed   and  if your Louisa inherits my blood or spirit    not all the engines in France will ever compel her to give her hand   to another  In the mean time  follow us not   come not near us    we beseech you  Should you be discovered  you will inevitably   be assassinated  and we also should perish in your loss  my son    We are distracted by our fears for you  and it is this fear that has   prevented us from disclosing ourselves fully to you  Keep up   your correspondence  however
