mentioned my hatred of him as the greatest of all affectations  and insisted that nothing could be so contemptible as his stooping to accept of a woman for his wife whom another had already possessed as his mistress  These arguments Mrs  Lawson hinted would wind him up sometimes   159 to a downright determination of proceeding to the most absolute violations—he seemed fearful of being despised by his friends—and frequently talked of pursuing their advice—but  in the midst of all his resolutions  the desire which he had to make me his irrevocably  and the dread he was under lest I should commit some instant act of desperation on myself if he went to such shocking extremities  prevented him from executing his horrid design  so that when he found I was really in danger  every thought of an illicit nature was immediately sacrificed to his concern for my recovery—By this means  my dear Harriot  I very happily escaped every actual dishonour  and  tho  his detestable passion was the source of such exquisite distress  still it was that very passion which was the ultimate cause of my preservation     160I will not  my dear Harriot  trespass on your patience by a minute detail of all I suffered in this odious house during a period of seven months—Suffice it  that I was scarcely recovered from my first fit of illness  but a fresh attempt to force me into a marriage brought on a relapse  which saved me from a world of the most insupportable persecution  and changed the detestable importunities of Hastings into a fresh concern for my life—This second interposition of Providence  for I consider it as such in my favour  lasted three months—and the wretch was so miserable at that time on my account  that he expressed a resolution of using no means but humility and confinement to work upon my temper for the future—In about three months time I was again tollerably recovered  and beginning again to dread some lawless attempt from Sir Harry  when one of these common  yet unexpected accidents    161 which are sometimes productive of events which cannot be brought about by the utmost exertion of human wisdom  set me free from captivity  and opened a new scene in my history  perhaps not less extraordinary than any of the former passages   Sir Harry  and some of his fellow libertines  had been making merry below stairs one day   for I should have told you  that  during the whole time of my imprisonment  I never once eat a morsel out of those rooms which were particularly set apart for my use  and sat up  according to custom  so extremely late  that none of them retired sober to their rooms —I myself heard some of them very noisy on the stairs when they broke up  and therefore could give a probable guess at their situations —I don t know what was the matter with me  but that night I would not pull off my cloaths  and only threw   162 myself across the bed  to indulge myself in one of those melancholly reveries which are generally pleasing to the unfortunate —between three and four  however  I grew a little heavy  and had just began to doze  when Mrs  Lawson and her daughter  who always lay in an adjoining bed in the same room  as well to prevent me from any possibility of escaping  as to take care that my apartments were not approached by any of her master s friends  gave a violent shriek  and  jumping out of bed with the utmost precipitation  exclaimed  that the house was in flames  It was now about the beginning of October  and wanted a considerable while to day  I started up  and found the matter just as they represented it  the fire blazing fiercely through the windows  and the servants  who were by this time alarmed  were some of them unlocking the street door  and unbolting the parlour windows  while   163 others were busied in assisting their intoxicated masters out of bed —This was an opportunity  my dear Harriot  not to be neglected  already dressed  I took advantage of the general confusion  and  slipping out in nothing but a black silk night gown  while every body s attention was employed on something else  I gained the road  dark as it was  and trudged on without knowing  or indeed caring  which way I went  so I could but get far enough from that detested Hastings —The only apprehension I laboured under  was that of being pursued and overtaken by some of the wretch s emissaries  the moment he became acquainted with my flight  But  as if Providence was particularly determined to rescue me from his hands  I was overtaken by a ministring angel  in the humble shape of a gardener s wife  who was singing with all the chearfulness of a benevolent mind  and going with a cartload of vegetables to one of the London   164 markets —I addressed myself to her at once  told her that I was an unfortunate young woman  who had been carried off from my friends by force about seven months before  and that the villain s house  who had taken me away  being that moment on fire  I had seized the opportunity  and made my escape  I therefore begged her protection  and assured her I would make it worth her while
