to the tumefaction of features naturally strong  and a whole week s growth of a very bushy beard  produced on the whole a most hideous caricatura  After all  there was a necessity for the administration of the surgeon  who found divers contusions on different parts of the skull  which even the tin cap had not been able to protect from the weapons of the rustics   These being shaved and dressed secundum artem  and the operator dismissed with a proper acknowledgment  our knight detached one of the post boys to the field of action for intelligence concerning Mr  Clarke and squire Timothy  and  in the interim  desired to know the particulars of Crowe s adventures since he parted from him at the White Hart   A connected relation  in plain English  was what he had little reason to expect from the novice  who  nevertheless  exerted his faculties to the uttermost for his satisfaction  He give him to understand  that in steering his course to Birmingham  where he thought of fitting himself with tackle  he had fallen in  by accident  at a public house  with an itinerant tinker  in the very act of mending a kettle  that  seeing him do his business like an able workman  he had applied to him for advice  and the tinker  after having considered the subject  had undertaken to make him such a suit of armour as neither sword nor lance should penetrate  that they adjourned to the next town  where the leather coat  the plates of tinned iron  the lance  and the broadsword  were purchased  together with a copper saucepan  which the artist was now at work upon in converting it to a shield  but in the meantime  the captain  being impatient to begin his career of chivalry  had accommodated himself with a pot lid  and taken to the highway  notwithstanding all the entreaties  tears  and remonstrances of his nephew  Tom Clarke  who could not however be prevailed upon to leave him in the dangerous voyage he had undertaken   That this being but the second day of his journey  he descried five or six men on horseback bearing up full in his teeth  upon which he threw his sails aback  and prepared for action  that he hailed them at a considerable distance  and bade them bring to  when they came alongside  notwithstanding his hail  he ordered them to clew up their courses  and furl their topsails  otherwise he would be foul of their quarters  that  hearing this salute  they luffed all at once  till their cloth shook in the wind  then he hallooed in a loud voice  that his sweetheart  Besselia Mizzen  were the broad pendant of beauty  to which they must strike their topsails on pain of being sent to the bottom  that  after having eyed him for some time with astonishment  they clapped on all their sails  some of them running under his stern  and others athwart his forefoot  and got clear off  that  not satisfied with running ahead  they all of a sudden tacked about  and one of them boarding him on the lee quarter  gave him such a drubbing about his upper works  that the lights danced in his lanterns  that he returned the salute with his hop pole so effectually that his aggressor broached to in the twinkling of a handspike  and then he was engaged with all the rest of the enemy  except one  who sheered off  and soon returned with a mosquito fleet of small craft  who had done him considerable damage  and  in all probability  would have made prize of him  had n t he been brought off by the knight s gallantry  He said  that in the beginning of the conflict Tom Clarke rode up to the foremost of the enemy  as he did suppose in order to prevent hostilities  but before he got up to him near enough to hold discourse  he was pooped with a sea that almost sent him to the bottom  and then towed off he knew not whither   Crowe had scarce finished his narration  which consisted of broken hints and unconnected explosions of sea terms  when a gentleman of the neighbourhood  who acted in the commission of the peace  arrived at the gate  attended by a constable  who had in custody the bodies of Thomas Clarke and Timothy Crabshaw  surrounded by five men on horseback  and an innumerable posse of men  women  and children  on foot  The captain  who always kept a good look out  no sooner descried this cavalcade and procession  than he gave notice to Sir Launcelot  and advised that they should crowd away with all the cloth they could carry  Our adventurer was of another opinion  and determined  at any rate  to procure the enlargement of the prisoners   The justice  ordering his attendants to stay without the gate  sent his compliments to Sir Launcelot Greaves  and desired to speak with him for a few minutes  He was immediately admitted  and could not help staring at sight of Crowe  who  by this time  had no remains of the human physiognomy  so much was the swelling increased and the skin discoloured  The gentleman  whose name was Mr  Elmy  having made a polite apology
