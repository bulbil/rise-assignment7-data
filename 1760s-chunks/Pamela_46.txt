something of what I intended  or   else she would not have done it  though I have reason  I am sure  to   remember the last closet work       So I said  when she came up  Here  Mrs  Jervis  is the first parcel    I will spread it all abroad  These are the things my good lady gave   me   In the first place  said I  and so I went on describing the clothes   and linen my lady had given me  mingling blessings  as I proceeded    for her goodness to me  and when I had turned over that parcel  I said    Well  so much for the first parcel  Mrs  Jervis  that was my lady s   gifts       Now I come to the presents of my dear virtuous master  Hey  you know   closet for that  Mrs  Jervis  She laughed  and said  I never saw such a   comical girl in my life  But go on  I will  Mrs  Jervis  said I  as soon   as I have opened the bundle  for I was as brisk and as pert as could be    little thinking who heard me       Now here  Mrs  Jervis  said I  are my ever worthy master s presents  and   then I particularised all those in the second bundle       After which  I turned to my own  and said       Now  Mrs  Jervis  comes poor Pamela s bundle  and a little one it is to   the others  First  here is a calico nightgown  that I used to wear o    mornings   Twill be rather too good for me when I get home  but I must   have something  Then there is a quilted calamanco coat  and a pair of   stockings I bought of the pedlar  and my straw hat with blue strings    and a remnant of Scots cloth  which will make two shirts and two shifts    the same I have on  for my poor father and mother  And here are four   other shifts  one the fellow to that I have on  another pretty good one    and the other two old fine ones  that will serve me to turn and wind   with at home  for they are not worth leaving behind me  and here are two   pair of shoes  I have taken the lace off  which I will burn  and may be   will fetch me some little matter at a pinch  with an old silver buckle   or two       What do you laugh for  Mrs  Jervis  said I   Why you are like an April   day  you cry and laugh in a breath       Well  let me see  ay  here is a cotton handkerchief I bought of the   pedlar  there should be another somewhere  O  here it is  and here too   are my new bought knit mittens  and this is my new flannel coat  the   fellow to that I have on and in this parcel  pinned together  are   several pieces of printed calico  remnants of silks  and such like    that  if good luck should happen  and I should get work  would serve   for robins and facings  and such like uses  And here too are a pair of   pockets  they are too fine for me  but I have no worse  Bless me  said   I  I did not think I had so many good things       Well  Mrs  Jervis  said I  you have seen all my store  and I will now   sit down  and tell you a piece of my mind       Be brief then  said she  my good girl  for she was afraid  she said   afterwards  that I should say too much       Why then the case is this  I am to enter upon a point of equity and   conscience  Mrs  Jervis  and I must beg  if you love me  you d let me   have my own way  Those things there of my lady s  I can have no claim   to  so as to take them away  for she gave them me  supposing I was to   wear them in her service  and to do credit to her bountiful heart  But    since I am to be turned away  you know  I cannot wear them at my poor   father s  for I should bring all the little village upon my back  and so   I resolve not to have them       Then  Mrs  Jervis  said I  I have far less right to these of my worthy   master s  for you see
