enabled to appear in the sphere of a gentleman  to which  while I knew him  he had not even the ambition to aspire —But I was too much concerned in the affair to neglect further information  and therefore took the first opportunity of asking the porter if he knew the gentleman to whom the Marquis spoke  The Swiss told me  his name was Monsieur d Estrapes  that he had been   71valet de chambre to an English gentleman lately deceased  and that he was very much regarded by the Marquis for his fidelity to his master  between whom and that nobleman a very intimate friendship had subsisted —Nothing could be more agreeable to me than this piece of intelligence  which banished all doubt of its being my friend  who had found means to frenchify his name as well as his behaviour  since we parted  As soon therefore  as I was relieved  I went to his lodging  according to a direction given me by the Swiss  and had the good fortune to find him at home  That I might surprize him the more  I concealed my name and business  and only desired the servant of the house  to tell Monsieur d Estrapes  that I begged the honour of half an hour s conversation with him —He was confounded and dismayed at this message  when he understood it was sent by a soldier  though he was conscious to himself of no crime  all that he had heard of the Bastile appeared to his imagination with aggravated horror  and it was not before I had waited a considerable time  that he had resolution enough to bid the servant shew me up stairs —When I entered his chamber  he returned my bow with great civility  and endeavoured with forced complaisance  to disguise his fear  which appeared in the paleness of his face  the wildness of his looks  and the shaking of his limbs —I was diverted at his consternation  which redoubled  when I told him  in French  I had business for his private ear  and demanded a particular audience —The valet being withdrawn  I asked in the same language  if his name was d Estrapes  to which he answered  with a faultering tongue    The same  at your service  —    72   Are you a Frenchman   said I   —   I have not the honour to be a Frenchman born  replied he  but I have an infinite veneration for the country  —  I then desired he would do me the honour to look at me  which he no sooner did  than struck with my appearance  he started back and cried in English    O Jesus —sure it can t —No   tis impossible  —  I smiled at his interjections  saying    I suppose you are too much of a gentleman to own your friend in adversity  —  When he heard me pronounce these words in our own language  he leaped upon me in a transport of joy  hung about my neck  kissed me from ear to ear  and blubbered like a great school boy who has been whipt —Then observing my dress  he set up his throat  crying    O L—d  O L—d  that ever I should live to see my dearest friend reduced to the condition of a foot soldier in the French service  Why did you consent to my leaving you —But I know the reason—you thought you had got more creditable friends  and grew ashamed of my acquaintance —Ah  Lord help us  though I was a little short sighted  I was not altogether blind —And though I did not complain  I was not the less sensible of your unkindness  which was indeed the only thing that induced me to ramble abroad  the Lord knows whither  but I must own it has been a lucky ramble to me  and so I forgive you  and may God forgive you —O L—d  O L—d  is it come to this  —  I was nettled at the charge  which  though just  I could not help thinking unseasonable  and told him with some tartness  that whether his suspicions were well or ill grounded  he might   73 have chosen a more convenient opportunity of introducing them  And that the question now was  whether or no he found himself disposed to lend me any assistance —   Disposed   replied he with great emotion  I thought you had known me so well  as to assure yourself  without asking  that I  and all that belongs to me  are at your command —In the mean time  you shall dine with me  and I will tell you something that  perhaps  will not be displeasing unto you  —  Then wringing my hand  he said    It makes my heart bleed to see you in that garb  —  I thanked him for his invitation  which  I observed  could not be unwelcome to a person who had not eaten a comfortable meal these seven months  but I had another request to make  which I begged he would grant before dinner  and that was the loan of a shirt  For although my back had been many weeks a stranger to any comfort of this kind  my skin was not yet quite familiarized to the
