design extended no further than   to prevail on her to make such a will   he had drawn it himself  as   I have told you  and took care to word it in such a manner  as he   thought should give him  under the appearance of her executor   and trustee  as she designed him  a real property in her wealth     as it was immediately to come into his hands on her death  and   there was no time appointed for the fulfilling her pious intentions      But here his sagacity disappointed itself   for  neglecting to take   proper advice  or afraid of making any person privy to his designs    he had committed such material errors in the form of the will as   gave room to learned counsel to set it aside in favour of the heir at    law  her nephew  who from cleaning shoes under a gateway  was   enriched with at least a third part of his aunt s fortune  which re    mained to him  after the costs of the suit that had been carried on   for him in formd pauperis  while her executor had the vexation   of disappointment aggravated by a decree to pay all the cost  This   was a severe stroke   but it did not break his spirit  though it   obliged him to return to his former occupation of an almoner  which   you see he pursues with that attention which always insures success      I see you sink under the pain of finding the best actions debased    by springing from such motives   but be careful to avoid an error    fatally too prevalent  of concluding from the abuse  against the use   of anything that may  in its end  be conducive to good          102 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     These instances I have given  and I could add many more   not   to depreciate the custom of giving to public charities  which is the   noblest use of wealth  but to caution you against the dangerous   error of thinking that such giving alone  without reformation of life    and the active practice of the other virtues  can be acceptable in   the sight of Him to whom it is offered  or efficacious to procure his   favour   and to show the absurd impiety of persisting in vice  with   a vain hope of bribing Heaven with the wages of Hell      But to relieve your pain  behold that venerable person who sits   opposite to him   the serenity of whose looks shows the happiness   of his mind  Read his heart  and you will not find one discontent   or sorrow there  but what humanity imprints for the distresses of   his fellow creatures  which his beneficence  his real charity  is for    ever finding methods to relieve  not only by pecuniary benefactions    though to these is devoted the far greater part of his ample fortune    but also by his advice  instruction  and good office  the judicious appli    cation and sincerity of which makes them very rarely fail of success    He is a real supporter of charity in its most extensive sense   hia   example giving a sanction  a seal of virtue  to everything he appears   in  which puts wicked wit out of countenance  and stops the tongue   of calumny   and is  even were it alone   sufficient to counterbalance   all the instances which could be brought against it  Hia long life    which has been extended by Heaven  as a blessing to mankind  has   been a constant illustration of the religion he teaches   not one   instance of his actions ever contradicting his profession  as near   as human weakness can act up to divine perfection      Such is this clergyman   such should all clergymen be  to preserve   the purity  the dignity of a function  whose rules are drawn from   perfection  and calculated to prepare the human for a participation   of the divine nature   to accomplish which greatest end  all profession    not enforced by practice  must be ineflfeotual      To mention any one instance of his good works would be doing   injustice to the rest  and contradicting the desire of his heart  which   next to doing good  is to conceal what he does  his actions being   so far from ostentation  that to Heaven only  and the parties them    selves  are they revealed   nor to these even is the hand that reaches   them the blessing always known          CHAPTER XXXIV     OONTINXTED   THE HISTORY OF A BBAB LBADEB â€” HIS METHOD OT   MAKING HIS pupil s MASTERS EARN THEIR MONET â€” THE GENBBAIi   CONSEQUENCE OF CLOSE FRIENDSHIPS BETWEEN THE
