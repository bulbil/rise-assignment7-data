  have cause to be vexed then       Nay  Pamela  said she  don t imagine that I would be accessory to your   ruin for the world  I only can say  that he has  yet  done you no hurt    and it is no wonder he should love you  you are so pretty  though so   much beneath him but  I dare swear for him  he never will offer you any   force       You say  said I  that he was sorry for his first offer in the   summer house  Well  and how long did his sorrow last   Only till he   found me by myself  and then he was worse than before  and so became   sorry again  And if he has deigned to love me  and you say can t help   it  why  he can t help it neither  if he should have an opportunity    a third time to distress me  And I have read that many a man has been   ashamed of his wicked attempts  when he has been repulsed  that would   never have been ashamed of them  had he succeeded  Besides  Mrs  Jervis    if he really intends to offer no force  What does that mean   While you   say he can t help liking me  for love it cannot be  Does it not imply   that he hopes to ruin me by my own consent  I think  said I   and hope   I should have grace to do so   that I should not give way to his   temptations on any account  but it would be very presumptuous in me to   rely upon my own strength against a gentleman of his qualifications and   estate  and who is my master  and thinks himself entitled to call me   bold face  and what not  only for standing on my necessary defence  and   that  too  where the good of my soul and body  and my duty to God  and   my parents  are all concerned  How then  Mrs  Jervis  said I  can I ask   or wish to stay       Well  well  says she  as he seems very desirous you should not stay  I   hope it is from a good motive  for fear he should be tempted to disgrace   himself as well as you  No  no  Mrs  Jervis  said I  I have thought   of that too  for I would be glad to consider him with that duty that   becomes me  but then he would have let me go to Lady Davers  and not   have hindered my preferment  and he would not have said  I should return   to my poverty and distress  when  by his mother s goodness  I had been   lifted out of it  but that he intended to fright me  and punish me  as   he thought  for not complying with his wickedness  And this shews me   well enough what I have to expect from his future goodness  except I   will deserve it at his own dear price       She was silent  and I added  Well  there s no more to be said  I must   go  that s certain  All my concern will be how to part with you  and    indeed  after you  with every body  for all my fellow servants have   loved me  and you and they will cost me a sigh  and a tear too  now and   then  I am sure  And so I fell a crying  I could not help it  For it   is a pleasant thing to one to be in a house among a great many   fellow servants  and be beloved by them all       Nay  I should have told you before now  how kind and civil Mr  Longman   our steward is  vastly courteous  indeed  on all occasions  And he said   once to Mrs  Jervis  he wished he was a young man for my sake  I should   be his wife  and he would settle all he had upon me on marriage  and    you must know  he is reckoned worth a power of money       I take no pride in this  but bless God  and your good examples  my dear   parents  that I have been enabled so to carry myself  as to have every   body s good word  Not but our cook one day  who is a little snappish and   cross sometimes  said once to me  Why this Pamela of ours goes as fine   as a lady  See what it is to have a fine face   I wonder what the girl   will come to at last       She was hot with her work  and I sneaked
