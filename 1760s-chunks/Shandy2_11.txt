was a fair opportunity for my uncle Toby to have triumph d over my father in his turn —for no mortal  who had beheld Dr  Slop in that pickle  could have dissented from so much  at least  of my uncle Toby s opinion   That may hap his sister might not care to let such a Dr  Slop come so near her          But it was the Argumentum ad hominem  and if my uncle Toby was not very expert at it  you may think  he might not care to use it —No  the reason was — twas not his nature to insult     Dr  Slop s presence  at that time  was no less problematical than the mode of it  tho   it is certain  one moment s reflection in my father might have solved it  for he had apprized Dr  Slop but the week before  that my mother was at her full reckoning  and as the doctor had heard nothing since   twas natural and very political too in him  to have taken a ride to Shandy Hall  as he did  merely to see how matters went on   But my father s mind took unfortunately a wrong turn in the investigation  running  like the hypercritic s  altogether upon the ringing of the bell and the rap upon the door —measuring their distance —and keeping his mind so intent upon the operation  as to have power to think of nothing else —common place infirmity of the greatest mathematicians     working with might and main at the demonstration  and so wasting all their strength upon it  that they have none left in them to draw the corollary  to do good with   The ringing of the bell and the rap upon the door  struck likewise strong upon the sensorium of my uncle Toby —but it excited a very different train of thoughts —the two irreconcileable pulsations instantly brought Stevinus  the great engineer  along with them  into my uncle Toby s mind —What business Stevinus had in this affair —is the greatest problem of all —it shall be solved —but not in the next chapter     CHAP  XI   WRiting  when properly managed   as you may be sure I think mine is  is but a different name for conversation  As no one  who knows what he is about in good company  would venture to talk all —so no author  who understands the just boundaries of decorum and good breeding  would presume to think all  The truest respect which you can pay to the reader s understanding  is to halve this matter amicably  and leave him something to imagine  in his turn  as well as yourself   For my own part  I am eternally paying him compliments of this kind  and do all that lies in my power to keep his imagination as busy as my own      Tis his turn now —I have given an ample description of Dr  Slop s sad overthrow  and of his sad appearance in the back parlour —his imagination must now go on with it for a while   Let the reader imagine then  that Dr  Slop has told his tale —and in what words  and with what aggravations his fancy chooses —Let him suppose  that Obadiah has told his tale also  and with such rueful looks of affected concern  as he thinks will best contrast the two figures as they stand by each other —Let him imagine  that my father has stepp d up stairs to see my mother —And  to conclude this work of imagination —let him imagine the doctor wash d —rubb d down —condoled with —felicitated —got into a pair of Obadiah s pumps  stepping forwards towards the    door  upon the very point of entring upon action   Truce —truce  good Dr  Slop —stay thy obstetric hand —return it safe into thy bosom to keep it warm —little dost thou know what obstacles —little dost thou think what hidden causes retard its operation —Hast thou  Dr  Slop —hast thou been intrusted with the secret articles of this solemn treaty which has brought thee into this place —Art thou aware that  at this instant  a daughter of Lucina is put obstetrically over thy head  Alas   tis too true —Besides  great son of Pilumnus  what canst thou do —Thou hast come forth unarm d —thou hast left thy tire tête —thy new inventedforceps —thy crotchet —thy squirt  and all thy instruments of salvation and deliverance behind thee —By heaven     at this moment they are hanging up in a green bays bag  betwixt thy two pistols  at thy bed s head —Ring —call —send Obadiah back upon the coach horse to bring them with all speed   —Make great haste  Obadiah  quoth my father  and I ll give thee a crown —and  quoth my uncle Toby  I ll give him another   CHAP  XII   YOUR sudden and unexpected arrival  quoth my uncle Toby  addressing himself to Dr  Slop  all three of them sitting down to the fire together  as my uncle Toby began to speak —instantly brought the great Stevinus into my head  who  you must know  is a favourite    author with me —Then  added my father  making use of
