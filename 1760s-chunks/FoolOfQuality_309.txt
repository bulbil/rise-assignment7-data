he not hear   Wherefore  as our   spiiits are the offsprings of his divine Spirit  we may justly presume   them endowed with like capacities  But if body is necessary to the   perception of spirit  as Zoroaster  the illuminated philosopher  seems   to intimate  where  speaking of God  he says    whose body is light    and whose soul is truth     in this case  1 say  we may reasonably   suppose that  when our spirits shall be parted from these gross and   frail bodies  they shall be instantly clothed upon with more pure and   permanent bodies  Or  as I rather think  that those pure and per    manent bodies are already forming  and pregnant within our gross   and corruptible bodies   and that when the midwife  death  shall   deliver us from the dark womb of our woful travail and mortality    we shall immediately spring forth into incorruption and glory      Of this  my lord  I am as confident as I am of my being  that he   who by faith hath already put on Christ  shall break through death   in the brightness of the body of his new birth  incorruptible  im    mortal  and blessed to all eternity      Tell me  then  my dearest Meekly  what mean you by the body   of this new birth   for  alas   I am but too apt to cry out with   Nicodemus    How can these things be         I mean  my lord  the forming of Christ within us  our being   formed anew of a divine seed of our second Adam  even as our   gross bodies were formed in the womb from a corruptible seed of   the old Adam  I mean the clothing of our spirits with the heavenly   substantiality of the spiritual body and blood of the heavenly Jesus   himself  for  as the apostle says   There is a spiritual body  as   there is a carnal body   I mean a body the same as that in which   the believing thief entered paradise with his Lord on the day of   the crucifixion    I am the resurrection and the life   saith Jesus       whoso believeth in me  though he were dead  yet shall he live     and he who liveth and believeth in me shall never die   Death   shall become a new and divine birth unto him  And the great     z         338 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      apostle says    There are celestial bodies  and bodies terrestrial   but   the glory of the celestial is one  and the glory of the terrestrial is   another   And again he says    For we know that if our earthly   house of this tabernacle were dissolved  we have a building of God    an house not made with hands  eternal in the heavens       These are great things indeed  Mr  Meekly  and full of hope  as   well as incitements to divine ambition      But why  my lord  should a new birth from Jesus Christ be   thought wonderful   Is there any thing more wonderful in it than   in the forming and unfolding of the whole stupendous mechanism   of the body of our old man from a scarce visible speck of entity   Is   there any thing more wonderful in it than in the growth and   unfolding of any common vegetable from some latent principle or   invisible speck in the seed  which not all the optics and glasses of   a Galileo should be able to discover  Were not these the known   facts of every day and hour  incredulity would have laughed the   supposition to nought  But I think I have got about me something   surprisingly analogous and apposite to the nature and manner of   our new birth in Jesus      Mr  Meekly then put his hand in his pocket and took out a lump   of matter  in form like a long and huge maggot  evidently without   motion  apparently without life  and hard and incrusted all about   to the feeling      What have you got there  my friend  said the earl  An old   worm  my lord  that at this instant is pregnant with the birth of a   new creature  Impossible   cried the earl   the thing is absolutely   dead   The body of the old worm is dead  indeed  my lord   but   there is certainly a principle of a new life within it  that will soon   manifest itself in the birth of a very beautiful and wonderfully   glorious creature  And this you will find if you leave it
