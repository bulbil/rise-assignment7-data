at was a method  which I was pretty sure would not meet with their approbation  however  she left me  after making some professions of a nature so extremely generous  yet delicate  that I could not help lamenting    31 after her departure  to find so very worthless a man as her brother engrossed so great a share of her affection  For my own part  I once loved him  once tenderly loved him  but why do I torture my recollection with his name  his baseness has cured me of that passion  and I am now alive to nothing but the sense of my dishonour  and the afflictions of my family     That these afflictions may be speedily removed  my dearest mama  is my incessant prayer  life has now no other charm but the hope of seeing your happiness  the happiness of my papa  and the happiness of my brother  reestablished  could I once see these desirable events  I should sink contented into my grave  for  though I shall never know a moment s peace in this world  I shall not enter upon the next with any satisfaction  if I have but the smallest   32 cause to think that you remember me with regret  Do not  therefore  my everto be revered mama  suffer yourself to feel any uneasiness on my account  Do not let the recollection of a guilty creature like me prey upon your health  and render the family misfortune irreparable  My dear brother  madam  deserves all your tenderness  and  could a union be brought about between him and my amiable Miss Beauclerk  she would supply every thing which I once endeavoured to be—before I was unworthy to be called your dutiful daughter   LOUISA MILDMAY     33  LETTER XV  Mr  MELMOTH  to Sir ROBERT HAROLD   Dear HAROLD   YOU are certainly one of the happiest fellows in the world  every thing is in a fair way of being adjusted to your wishes  and  before the end of six weeks  I am in hopes to give you joy on your marriage with the amiable Miss Mildmay   The moment I received your last letter I went to lady Haversham with it  and you may easily judge how much that excellent woman was affected at the contents  Tremblingly attentive to your safety  it was with the greatest difficulty she could go through your account of the duel  and  generously sensible to the distresses of the Mildmay   34 family  she felt very severely for the misfortune of the colonel—   O  Mr  Melmoth   cried she   what must poor Louisa suffer  what must the good Mrs  Mildmay suffer  on this shocking occasion  My brother  conscious of his guilt  should have borne every thing  and yet  upon the whole  he has acted with more temper than I expected—See Sir   continued she   how wide  how general a ruin may be occasioned by one bad action  Did young fellows consider what a number of evils may possibly spring from the commission of a single crime  a moment s recollection would be sufficient to deter them from their most favourite pursuits  but  alas  totally regardless of consequences in the progress of their licentious designs  they think the young lady is the only person to be injured  without considering that there is a mother to die at   35 her destruction  and a father  or a brother  to madden at her disgrace     After lady Haversham had given way for some time to her emotion  I asked her if it would not be the most prudent step that could be taken  for her ladyship to set out instantly to Mildmay Hall with your letter in her hand  and fairly shew the father and mother how little you were to be blamed in your rencounter with the colonel  I observed  that  notwithstanding their resentment against you  they had every reason to treat her with the most unreserved affection  and I offered my service as an escorte  if she imagined I could accompany her with any degree of propriety  The motion met her approbation  and she accepted of my offer with great satisfaction  saying  that  as Miss Mildmay s misfortune could not possibly remain a secret  the presence of a man   36 so intimate with your family could by no means be indelicate  She  however  put off the expedition till the morning  being first of all desirous to see Louisa  whom she had not visited that day —And here I must inform you  Harold  that your sister has bought a very elegant chariot  and settled matters just as you could wish with Mrs  Darnel  When lady Haversham came to that part of your letter which mentions such a provision—it was too much for her  she laid the paper down  and bursting into a flood of tears  exclaimed—   Why  this is well thought of Mr  Melmoth—there is soul in this  what pity it is that he will not be uniformly good  and take as much pains to avoid the commission of an injury as he manifests inclination to repair it   —But to business     Yesterday morning we set out in a chariot and six for Mildmay Hall  and   37 arrived there
