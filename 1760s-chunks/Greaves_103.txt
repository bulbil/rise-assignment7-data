underwent a total suffusion  Her heart panted  her bosom heaved  and her gentle frame was agitated by transports rather violent than unpleasing  She soon  however  recollected herself  and her native serenity returned  when  rising from her seat  she declared he would see him in the next apartment  where he stood in the most tumultuous suspense  waiting for permission to approach her person  Here she broke in upon him  arrayed in an elegant white undress  the emblem of her purity  beaming forth the emanations of amazing beauty  warmed and improved with a glow of gratitude and affection  His heart was too big for utterance  he ran towards her with rapture  and throwing himself at her feet  imprinted a most respectful kiss upon her lily hand — This  divine Aurelia   cried he   is a foretaste of that ineffable bliss which you was born to bestow —Do I then live to see you smile again  to see you restored to liberty  your mind at ease  and your health unimpaired  — You have lived   said she   to see my obligations to Sir Launcelot Greaves accumulated in such a manner  that a whole life spent in acknowledgment will scarce suffice to demonstrate a due sense of his goodness  — You greatly overrate my services  which have been rather the duties of common humanity  than the efforts of a generous passion  too noble to be thus evinced —but let not my unseasonable transports detain you a moment longer on this detested scene  Give me leave to hand you into the coach  and commit you to the care of this good lady  attended by this honest young gentleman  who is my particular friend   So saying  he presented Mr  Thomas Clarke  who had the honour to salute the fair hand of the ever amiable Aurelia   The ladies being safely coached under the escort of the lawyer  Sir Launcelot assured them he should wait on them in the evening at the house of Dr  Kawdle  whither they immediately directed their course  Our hero  who remained with the constable and his gang  inquired for Mr  Bernard Shackle  upon whose person he intended to serve a writ of conspiracy  over and above a prosecution for robbery  in consequence of his having disencumbered the knight of his money and other effects  on the first night of his confinement  Mr  Shackle had discretion enough to avoid this encounter  and even to anticipate the indictment for felony  by directing one of his servants to restore the cash and papers  which our adventurer accordingly received before he quitted the house   In the prosecution of his search after Shackle  he chanced to enter the chamber of the bard  whom he found in dishabille  writing at a table  with a bandage over one eye  and his head covered with a nightcap of baize  The knight  having made an apology for this intrusion  desired to know if he could be of any service to Mr  Distich  as he was now at liberty to use the little influence he had for the relief of his fellow sufferers —The poet having eyed him for some time askance   I told you   said he   your stay in this place would be of short duration  —I have sustained a small disaster on my left eye  from the hands of a rascally cordwainer  who pretends to believe himself the King of Prussia  and I am now in the very act of galling his majesty with keen iambics — If you can help me to a roll of tobacco and a bottle of geneva  so —if you are not so inclined  your humble servant  I shall share in the joy of your deliverance    The knight declined gratifying him in these particulars  which he apprehended might be prejudicial to his health  but offered his assistance in redressing his grievances  provided he laboured under any cruel treatment or inconvenience   I comprehend the full extent of your generosity   replied the satirist   you are willing to assist me in everything  except the only circumstances in which assistance is required—God b w ye—If you see Ben Bullock  tell him I wish he would not dedicate any more of his works to me —D—n the fellow  he has changed his note  and begins to snivel —For my part  I stick to my former maxim  defy all the world  and will die hard  even if death should be preceded by damnation    The knight  finding him incorrigible  left him to the slender chance of being one day comforted by the dram bottle  but resolved  if possible  to set on foot an accurate inquiry into the economy and transactions of this private inquisition  that ample justice might be done in favour of every injured individual confined within its walls   In the afternoon he did not fail to visit his Aurelia  and all the protestations of their mutual passion were once more interchanged  He now produced the letter which had caused such fatal disquiet in his bosom  and Miss Darnel no sooner eyed the paper  than she recollected it was a formal dismission  which she had intended and directed for Mr  Sycamore  This the uncle had intercepted  and cunningly enclosed in another cover  addressed to Sir Launcelot Greaves  who was now astonished beyond
