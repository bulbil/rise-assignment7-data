them is forgiven  in order to continue the family and comfort his aged parents in their decline   Similar to this  there is a spirit of mercy breathes through the laws of England  which some erroneously endeavour to suppress  the laws however seem unwilling to punish the offender  or to furnish the officers of justice with every means of acting with severity  Those who arrest debtors are denied the use of arms  the nightly watch is permitted to repress the disorders of the drunken citizens only with clubs  justice in such a case seems to hide her terrors  and permits some offenders to escape rather than load any with a punishment disproportioned to the crime   Thus it is the glory of an Englishman  that he is not only governed by laws  but that these are   64 also tempered by mercy  a country restrained by severe laws  and those too executed with severity  as in Japan  is under the most terrible species of tyranny  a royal tyrant is generally dreadful to the great  but numerous penal laws grind every rank of people  and chiefly those least able to resist oppression  the poor   It is very possible  thus for a people to become slaves to laws of their own enacting  as the Athenians were to those of Draco     It might first happen  says the historian  that men with peculiar talents for villainy attempted to evade the ordinances already established  their practices therefore soon brought on a new law levelled against them  but the same degree of cunning which had taught the knave to evade the former statutes  taught him to evade the latter also  he flew to new shifts  while justice pursued with new ordinances  still however he kept his proper distance  and whenever one crime was judged penal by the state  he left committing it in order to practise some unforbidden species of villainy  Thus the criminal against whom the threatenings were denounced always escaped free  while the simple rogue alone felt the rigour of justice  In the mean time penal laws became numerous  almost every person in the state unknowingly at different times offended  and was every moment subject to a malicious prosecution    In fact  penal laws  instead of preventing crimes  are generally enacted after the commission  instead of repressing the growth of ingenious villainy  only multiply deceit  by putting it upon new shifts and expedients of practising with impunity       65Such laws therefore resemble the guards which are sometimes imposed upon tributary Princes  apparently indeed to secure them from danger  but in reality  to confirm their captivity   Penal laws  it must be allowed  secure property in a state  but they also diminish personal security in the same proportion  There is no positive law how equitable soever  that may not be sometimes capable of injustice  When a law enacted to make theft punishable with death  happens to be equitably executed  it can at best only guard our possessions  but when by favour or ignorance justice pronounces a wrong verdict  it then attacks our lives  since in such a case the whole community suffers with the innocent victim  if therefore in order to secure the effects of one man  I should make a law which may take away the life of another  in such a case to attain a smaller good  I am guilty of a greater evil  to secure society in the possession of a bauble  I render a real and valuable possession precarious  And indeed the experience of every age may serve to vindicate the assertion  No law could be more just than that called lesae Majestatis  when Rome was governed by Emperors  It was but reasonable  that every conspiracy against the administration should be detected and punished  yet what terrible slaughters succeeded in consequence of its enacting  proscriptions  stranglings  poisonings  in almost every family of distinction  yet all done in a legal way  every criminal had his trial  and lost his life by a majority of witnesses   And such will ever be the case  where punishments are numerous  and where a weak  vicious    66 but above all  where a mercenary magistrate is concerned in their execution  such a man desires to see penal laws encreased  since he too frequently has it in his power to turn them into instruments of extortion  in such hands the more laws  the wider means  not of satisfying justice  but of satiating avarice   A mercenary magistrate who is rewarded in proportion  not to his integrity  but to the number he convicts  must be a person of the most unblemished character  or he will lean on the side of cruelty  and when once the work of injustice is begun  it is impossible to tell how far it will proceed  it is said of the Hyena that naturally it is no way ravenous  but when once it has tasted human flesh  it becomes the most voracious animal of the forest  and continues to persecute mankind ever after  A corrupt magistrate may be considered as a human Hyena  he begins perhaps by a private snap  he goes on to a morsel among friends  he proceeds to a meal in public  from a meal he advances to a surfeit  and at last sucks blood like a vampyre   Not into
