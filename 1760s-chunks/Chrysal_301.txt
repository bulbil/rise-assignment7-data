    As soon as everything was ready  my master set out for home    where he arrived without meeting anything remarkable in his   jonrney  as you may suppose  through uninhabited deserts  The   reception he met with from his people was the very reverse of what   sovereings usually meet  They welcomed him with sincere joy   and respect  which they expressed in the overflowing of their hearts    without ceremony or parade  I say   sovereigns    as he really   enjoyed that power in its most rational sense  his will being a law   to all around him  because they always found it just and advan    tageous to them  Though the account which he gave my late   master of his manner of treating his people showed a just foundation   for his power over them  I found that it depended not on that   alone  His authority  like that of the first rulers of the earth    was founded also on the relations of nature  and supported by its   strongest ties  he being literally the father of his subjects  the king   of his own family  To explain this  it is necessary to inform you    that on his fixing his residence among these uncivilized nations   in order to gain an influence over them the more readily  he had   laid aside all such rules of conduct as seemed to him to be cour   tradictory to natural reason and the public good  however forcibly   enjoined for particular convenience  Among these  the chief was   the custom of restraining the commerce between the sexes  and   confining individuals to each other  after the desire which first   brought them together had ceased  As he saw that the strongest   passion which governs the human heart is that desire  for his philo          354 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     sophy was not refined enough to suggest one thought of governing   the passions   and as the continuation of the species depends en    tirely on the gratification of it  he held every opposition to it to be   most criminal in itself  and detrimental to the public good  properly   the first object of every civil institution  and which can be promoted   no wav so effectually as by promoting population   and therefore   exerted all his influence to encourage that commerce  under such   restrictions only as were evidently necessary to procure the great   end of it  the propagation of the species  He gave liberty to every   man to converse with as many females as he pleased  and to quit   them whenever he thought proper  provided they were not pregnant   To the women the former liberty could not be extended  as the use   of it would defeat the design   or  where it had not immediately   that effect  cause confusion  and prevent both paternal care and   filial duty  by the uncertainty of descent  But the latter instance   they enjoyed equally with the men  being allowed to choose whom   they liked  and if not pregnant  quit them at pleasure  for others    without reproach or shame  the offspring of all which connections   were to remain with the fathers      I shall not say whether reason originally suggested this system   to him  or  as is often the case  whether he sought for reasons to   support the dictates of inclination  Be it which it would  the   efl ect was the same  His subjects increased in an uncommon   degree  and he founded  like the patriarchs of old  an authority   on the justest of all principles  voluntary consent  over a  people   inseparably linked to him and to each other  by the strongest ties   of nature  as being  by this complicated commerce  in the strictest   sense of one family   for  disdaining to make laws for others which   he would not observe himself  like too many of his brother legis    lators   he had enforced his precepts so powerfully by his example    that there was scarce a house in any of the tribes around him from   which he had not taken a temporary mate  and added a child of his   to their number  That his reception  as I observed  should be most   cordial from such subjects  is not to be wondered at  They flocked   about him on his arrival  and hailed him with one voice by every   tender relation of nature   brother  father  son  husband  showed   an affection too sublime to be expressed by formal rules  and im    possible to be seen without sympathizing in it  A Tien this tribute   was paid to nature  he called the elders of the people together    and distributing among them the presents which he had received   for that purpose
