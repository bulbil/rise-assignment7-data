how long  but when I shall live     Adio  Caro   Frances   LETTER CCXLIV  HENRY to FRANCES   I RECEIVED a Letter from you  just as I was leaving Belvidere Yesterday  which has surprized me more than any thing I have ever met with   Page  187The Reason of applying those philosophic Lectures  which you are offended at  was from this Blunder  That I thought the Loss of Health  Fortune  Friends  or any other Unhappiness of Life  was the proper Season to recommend such Medicines  and it ought to be observed  I did not use such Reflections to shew how I could bear your Misfortunes  but to instruct and assist you to support yourself under them  He  who would comfort another  comes not  as I apprehended  with Sighs and Groans   I shall never  upon any Occasion  trouble you with more of my Philosophy  but shall always cherish it in my Heart  because  at this Time  it stands your Friend  and helps me to conclude myself  as usual   My dear Fanny   Ever your s   LETTER CCXLV   My Dearest FANNY   I RETURN you Lady — s Letter  and am pleased to find  that you still hold on a Correspondence with her  I love her for rallying your Spirits  I am ashamed for my Fanny  with two such philosophic Friends  to be so cast down  She seems to solicit your writing often to her  Page  188 which surely I need not intreat you to obey  but shall only leave you more at Liberty to do so  by letting you know  that  if Time presses  I will take your having wrote to her  as a sufficient Apology for your leaving me to hunt through the Stores of Antiquity for something to amuse me  in the room of those Letters you neglect to me  How much do I regard your Advantage  before my own Pleasure  And for any Favour  she can ever do me  I thus pay the Price before hand   I thank you for your kind Sentiments with Regard to passing your Time with me  and it is certain that those Portions of Life  which we spend agreeably to ourselves  are all that can be computed in a Philosopher s Kalendar  I am pleased with the Epitaph  which Similis  a General under Adrian  directed to be inscribed on his Tomb stone  He had spent a long Life in Perils and Fatigues   till about seven Years before his Death  when he retired to his Villa  passing his Time as became a Man of Religion  Sense  and Philosophy  The Latin is    Hic jacet Similis  cujus Aetas multorum Annorum suit  Ipse septem duntaxat Annos vixit   I will attempt the Translation for you   My Life  O Time  to many Years amount   But seven only make my own Account   For my Part  I have made three Divisions of my Time  and  according to the Distinctions Page  189 I make  there are but two Portions of them to be attributed to my Life  When I am in Company  I pass my Time  when I am alone  I spend it  and  while I am with you  I enjoy it     Since the Election at —  I have had the Happiness to be entirely alone  which the Hurry  I was then in  has given me a thorough Relish for  I do not think it amiss to consider the World as a Prison  where we are subject to such Company  as Chance  Necessity  Vice  or Misfortune  have associated us with  And Solitude may be deemed the true Siege of Freedom  as there alone we can be Masters of Ourselves  our Time  and Occupations  The only Thing  in which I think Augustus attempted to be great  was his Wish to live  to retire  but he was never great enough to execute that noble Sentiment  It is somewhere said  that   Privacy and Freedom is the Wish of the Great  but the Privilege of the Mean   The Life  I lead at present  is certainly the End proposed of all the Labours and Perils of the Great  in all States of Life  then what a true  philosophic Pleasure must a Man be sensible of  who has reached this Goal  without being out of Breath for it  while he looks back  with Compassion  upon Millions  who are sweating and toiling  casting away Pomps  Fasces  and Fortune  to make themselves light for the Race  and shouldering through opposing Crouds  to come up Page  190 to him  What the Philosopher Cyneas said to Pyrrhus might be here applied  but that I hate Quotations  however  I shall give you one  Diogenes said  that  Aristotle must go to Dinner  when Alexander s Bell rung  but he was at Liberty to wait for the Summons of his Appetite   In the World  we are obliged to act by Rule  but  in Retirement  we can act according to Reason     Adieu  thou dear Object or Idea of those Portions of Time  which I treasure up as the
