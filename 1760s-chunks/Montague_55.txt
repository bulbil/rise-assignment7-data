 because I don t chuse any body should even guess at my views  I shall set out in the evening  and make a circuit to cross the river above the town       I shall not even take leave at Silleri  as I propose being back in four days  and I know your friend Bell will be inquisitive about my journey       Adieu   Your affectionate  ED  RIVERS     LETTER LXXXIV   84   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Silleri  March 6   YOUR brother is gone nobody knows whither  and without calling upon us before he set off  we are piqued  I assure you  my dear  and with some little reason   Four o clock       Very strange news  Lucy  they say Colonel Rivers is gone to marry Madame Des Roches  a lady at whose house he was some time in autumn  if this is true  I forswear the whole sex  his manner of stealing off is certainly very odd  and she is rich and agreable  but  if he does not love Emily  he has been excessively cruel in shewing an attention which has deceived her into a passion for him  I cannot believe it possible  not that he has ever told her he loved her  but a man of honor will not tell an untruth even with his eyes  and his have spoke a very unequivocal language       I never saw any thing like her confusion  when she was told he was gone to visit Madame Des Roches  but  when it was hinted with what design  I was obliged to take her out of the room  or she would have discovered all the fondness of her soul  I really thought she would have fainted as I led her out   Eight o clock       I have sent away all the men  and drank tea in Emily s apartment  she has scarce spoke to me  I am miserable for her  she has a paleness which alarms me  the tears steal every moment into her lovely eyes  Can Rivers act so unworthy a part  her tenderness cannot have been unobserved by him  it was too visible to every body   9th  Ten o clock       Not a line from your brother yet  only a confirmation of his being with Madame Des Roches  having been seen there by some Canadians who are come up this morning  I am not quite pleased  though I do not believe the report  he might have told us surely where he was going       I pity Emily beyond words  she says nothing  but there is a dumb eloquence in her countenance which is not to be described   Twelve o clock       I have been an hour alone with the dear little girl  who has  from a hint I dropt on purpose  taken courage to speak to me on this very interesting subject  she says   she shall be most unhappy if this report is true  though without the least right to complain of Colonel Rivers  who never even hinted a word of any affection for her more tender than friendship  that if her vanity  her self love  or her tenderness  have deceived her  she ought only to blame herself   She added   that she wished him to marry Madame Des Roches  if she could make him happy   but when she said this  an involuntary tear seemed to contradict the generosity of her sentiments       I beg your pardon  my dear  but my esteem for your brother is greatly lessened  I cannot help fearing there is something in the report  and that this is what Mrs  Melmoth meant when she mentioned his having an attachment       I shall begin to hate the whole sex  Lucy  if I find your brother unworthy  and shall give Fitzgerald his dismission immediately       I am afraid Mrs  Melmoth knows men better than we foolish girls do  she said  he attached himself to Emily meerly from vanity  and I begin to believe she was right  how cruel is this conduct  The man who from vanity  or perhaps only to amuse an idle hour  can appear to be attached where he is not  and by that means seduce the heart of a deserving woman  or indeed of any woman  falls in my opinion very little short in baseness of him who practises a greater degree of seduction       What right has he to make the most amiable of women wretched  a woman who would have deserved him had he been monarch of the universal world  I might add  who has sacrificed ease and affluence to her tenderness for him       You will excuse my warmth on such an occasion  however  as it may give you pain  I will say no more       Adieu   Your faithful  A  FERMOR     LETTER LXXXV   85   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Kamaraskas  March 12   I have met with something  my dear Lucy  which has given me infinite uneasiness  Madame Des Roches  from my extreme zeal to serve her in an affair wherein she has been hardly used  from my second visit
