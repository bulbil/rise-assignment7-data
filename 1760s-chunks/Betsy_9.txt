balance  if her money   was found too light to poise against the sums his son would be possessed   of  This being the case  he doubted not but that he was kept in   ignorance of the young man s intentions  and  fearing the matter might   be carried too far  resolved either to put a stop to it at once  or   permit it to go on  on such terms as should free him from all censure   from the one or the other party       On talking seriously to the lover  he soon found the suggestions he had   entertained had not deceived him  Young Saving frankly confessed  that   his father had other views for him  but added  that if he could prevail   on the young lady to marry him  he did not despair but that when the   thing was once done  and past recal  the alderman would by degrees   receive them into favour   You know  Sir   said he   that he has no   child but me  nor any kindred for whom he has the least regard  and it   cannot be supposed he would utterly discard me for following my   inclinations in this point  especially as they are in favour of the most   amiable and deserving of her sex        He said much more on this head  but it had no weight with the merchant    he answered  that if the alderman was of his way of thinking  all the   flattering hopes his passion suggested to him on that score  might be   realized  but that  according to the disposition he knew him to be of    he saw but little room to think he would forgive a step of this kind     Therefore   continued he   I cannot allow this love affair to be   prosecuted any farther  and must desire you will desist visiting at my   house  till you have either conquered this inclination  or Miss Betsy is   otherwise disposed of        This was a cruel sentence for the truly affectionate Saving  but he   found it in vain to solicit a repeal of it  and all he could obtain   from him  was a promise to say nothing of what had passed to the   alderman       Mr  Goodman would have thought he had but half compleated his duty  had   he neglected to sound the inclination of Miss Betsy on this account  and   in order to come more easily at the truth  he began with talking to her   in a manner which might make her look on him rather as a favourer of Mr    Saving s pretensions than the contrary  and was extremely glad to find    by her replies  how indifferent that young lover was to her  He then   acquainted her with the resolution he had taken  and the discourse he   had just had with him  and  to keep her from ever after encouraging the   addresses of any man  without being authorized by the consent of friends   on both sides  represented in the most pathetick terms he was able  the   danger to which a private correspondence renders a young woman liable    She seemed convinced of the truth of what he said  and promised to   follow  in the strictest manner  his advice       Whether she thought herself  in reality  so much obliged to the conduct   of her guardian in this  I will not take upon me to say  for though she   was not charmed with the person of Mr  Saving  it is certain she took an   infinite pleasure in the assiduities of his passion  it is  therefore    highly probable  that she might imagine he meddled in this affair more   than he had any occasion to have done  She had  however  but little time   for reflection on her guardian s behaviour  an accident happening  which   shewed her own to her in a light very different from what she had ever   seen it       Lady Mellasin had a ball at her house  there was a great deal of   company  among whom was a gentleman named Gayland  he was a man of   family  had a large estate  sung  danced  spoke French  dressed   well  frequent successes among the women had rendered him extremely   vain  and as he had too great an admiration for his own person to be   possessed of any great share of it for that of any other  he enjoyed the   pleasures of love  without being sensible of the pains  This darling of   the fair it was  that Miss Betsy picked out to treat with the most   peculiar marks of esteem  whenever she had a mind to give umbrage to   poor Saving  much had that faithful lover suffered on the account of   this fop
