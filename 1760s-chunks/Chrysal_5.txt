to make prime minister as soon as events allowed  Early   in 1762  Bute entered the Cabinet  By the end of the year   Pitt had resigned  a little too soon for the satisfaction of   Bute and the   king s friends    who found themselves with   a war on their hands that they had not the abiUty to carry   on  Very soon  moreover  as Pitt had anticipated  war broke   out with Spain  involving them in further embarrassments    The predominant partner got rid of  it was easy to oust New    castle   and Bute became prime minister in May 1762  with   a Cabinet comprising George Grenville  Sir Francis Dashwood    Halifax and Bedford  with Henry Fox in his favourite post   as Paymaster      Still the war proceeded gloriously  Pitt s measures con    tinuing to bear fruit   but the government had determined   to bring it to a speedy conclusion  The Peace of Paris was   forced through the Houses by means of wholesale bribery    Fox undertaking to manage the Commons in return for the   promise of a peerage  The peace was most unpopular   in   spite of the sterling benefits to England  it did not give   her all she had a right to demand  Dashwood s   financial blunders  an improvident loan  and a ludicrous         INTRODUCTION xi     tax on cider  aggravated the popidar clamour against the   government      All this while Bute  the target for the mob and innumerable   pamphleteers  was being assailed with unparalleled virulence   by Wilkes in The North Briton  a periodical called forth as   a counterblast to The Briton  Smollett s hireling journal on   the government side  On the 19th April 1763  the King s   Speech in proroguing Parliament described the peace as   honourable to his crown   on the 23rd appeared the famous   No  XLV of The North Briton  denouncing the speech  and   pouring obloquy on the ministers  The incidents that ensued   are related by Chrysal with very little disguise or distortion    The king took the article as a personal attack upon his in    tegrity  and moved heaven and earth to inflict vengeance   on the writer  A general warrant was issued by the secre    taries of state  HaUfaz and Egremont   forty nine persons   implicated in the printing and circulation of The North Briton   were arrested   and Wilkes being declared the author was   imprisoned under the same illegal authority  On May 6th    Lord Chief Justice Pratt decided that he was entitled to   privilege of ParUament  and set him at hberty  the decision   being followed by a series of actions for damage against the   secretaries of state and their officials  It is stated that this   unfortunate transaction cost the government more than a   hundred thousand pounds  Wilkes  of course  became a   popular idol   but in the next Parhament he was attacked   with a bitterer animosity by the creatures of the government    the infamous Essay on Woman  which Wilkes did not write     being the instrument selected for his chastisement in the Lords    whilst the other House voted No  XLV a false and seditious   libel  and ordered it to be burned by the hangman  Next   day Wilkes was entrapped into his duel with the cowardly   villain Martin  and as soon as his wound permitted he with    drew to Paris  Expulsion from the House of Commons   and outlawry followed  To pursue his later history  the   election for Middlesex and the agitation that evoked the   Letters of Junius  would carry us beyond the period dealt   with in Chrysal      Picturing the brawls and factions of the time  we can realise   the spirit in which the book was put together  Many of the   incidents of the Wilkes imbrogho and other hotly contested   affairs must have been set down by Johnstone almost at the   moment when they occurred  to be read by excitedÂ§ partisans   a few weeks later  Large parts of the book  indeed  have all   the sting and force of the keenest and most uncompromising   journahsm  and more deliberate and thoughtful force withal         xii INTRODUCTION     than that exhibited by Junius in the hurry of a controversy   in the press  The public and the private life of Pox and   Sandwich  Lord Bute  Bubb Dodington  Wilkes and Churchill    and scores of others known or unknown to history  were   related with hostile candour  and their portraits painted so   clearly that  in spite of the absence of names  no one could   mistake their identity      One of the latest of the numerous reprints
