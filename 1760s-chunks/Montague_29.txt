story is short and simple  I loved the most amiable of women  I was beloved  The avarice of our parents  who both had more gainful views for us  prevented an union on which our happiness depended  My Louisa  who was threatened with an immediate marriage with a man she detested  proposed to me to fly the tyranny of our friends  she had an uncle at Quebec  to whom she was dear  The wilds of Canada  said she  may afford us that refuge our cruel country denies us  After a secret marriage  we embarked  Our voyage was thus far happy  I landed on the opposite shore  to seek refreshments for my Louisa  I was returning  pleased with the thought of obliging the object of all my tenderness  when a beginning storm drove me to seek shelter in this bay  The storm encreased  I saw it s progress with agonies not to be described  the ship  which was in sight  was unable to resist its fury  the sailors crowded into the boat  they had the humanity to place my Louisa there  they made for the spot where I was  my eyes were wildly fixed on them  I stood eagerly on the utmost verge of the water  my arms stretched out to receive her  my prayers ardently addressed to Heaven  when an immense wave broke over the boat  I heard a general shriek  I even fancied I distinguished my Louisa s cries  it subsided  the sailors again exerted all their force  a second wave I saw them no more        Never will that dreadful scene be absent one moment from my memory  I fell senseless on the beach  when I returned to life  the first object I beheld was the breathless body of my Louisa at my feet  Heaven gave me the wretched consolation of rendering to her the last sad duties  In that grave all my happiness lies buried  I knelt by her  and breathed a vow to Heaven  to wait here the moment that should join me to all I held dear  I every morning visit her loved remains  and implore the God of mercy to hasten my dissolution  I feel that we shall not long be separated  I shall soon meet her  to part no more        He stopped  and  without seeming to remember he was not alone  walked hastily towards a little oratory he has built on the beach  near which is the grave of his Louisa  I followed him a few steps  I saw him throw himself on his knees  and  respecting his sorrow  returned to the house        Though I cannot absolutely approve  yet I more than forgive  I almost admire  his renouncing the world in his situation  Devotion is perhaps the only balm for the wounds given by unhappy love  the heart is too much softened by true tenderness to admit any common cure   Seven in the evening       I am returned to Madame Des Roches and her friends  who declined visiting the hermit  I found in his conversation all which could have adorned society  he was pleased with the sympathy I shewed for his sufferings  we parted with regret  I wished to have made him a present  but he will receive nothing       A ship for England is in sight  Madame Des Roches is so polite to send off this letter  we return to her house in the morning       Adieu  my Lucy   Yours   ED  RIVERS     LETTER XXXIII   33   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Quebec  Oct  12   I HAVE no patience with this foolish brother of yours  he is rambling about in the woods when we want him here  we have a most agreeable assembly every Thursday at the General s  and have had another ball since he has been gone on this ridiculous ramble  I miss the dear creature wherever I go  We have nothing but balls  cards  and parties of pleasure  but they are nothing without my little Rivers       I have been making the tour of the three religions this morning  and  as I am the most constant creature breathing  am come back only a thousand times more pleased with my own  I have been at mass  at church  and at the presbyterian meeting  an idea struck me at the last  in regard to the drapery of them all  that the Romish religion is like an over dressed  tawdry  rich citizen s wife  the presbyterian like a rude aukward country girl  the church of England like an elegant well dressed woman of quality   plain in her neatness   to quote Horace  who is my favorite author   There is a noble  graceful simplicity both in the worship and the ceremonies of the church of England  which  even if I were a stranger to her doctrines  would prejudice me strongly in her favor       Sir George sets out for Montreal this evening  so do the house of Melmoth  I have however prevailed on Emily to stay a month or two longer with me  I am rejoiced Sir George is going away  I am tired of seeing that eternal smile  that countenance of
