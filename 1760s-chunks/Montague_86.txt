  Silleri  May 14   I AM returned  my Rivers  to my sweet friend  and have again the dear delight of talking of you without restraint  she bears with  she indulges me in  all my weakness  if that name ought to be given to a tenderness of which the object is the most exalted and worthy of his sex       It was impossible I should not have loved you  the soul that spoke in those eloquent eyes told me  the first moment we met  our hearts were formed for each other  I saw in that amiable countenance a sensibility similar to my own  but which I had till then sought in vain  I saw there those benevolent smiles  which are the marks  and the emanations of virtue  those thousand graces which ever accompany a mind conscious of its own dignity  and satisfied with itself  in short  that mental beauty which is the express image of the Deity       What defence had I against you  my Rivers  since your merit was such that my reason approved the weakness of my heart       We have lost Madame Des Roches  we were both in tears at parting  we embraced  I pressed her to my bosom  I love her  my dear Rivers  I have an affection for her which I scarce know how to describe  I saw her every day  I found infinite pleasure in being with her  she talked of you  she praised you  and my heart was soothed  I however found it impossible to mention your name to her  a reserve for which I cannot account  I found pleasure in looking at her from the idea that she was dear to you  that she felt for you the tenderest friendship  do you know I think she has some resemblance of you  there is something in her smile  which gives me an idea of you       Shall I  however  own all my folly  I never found this pleasure in seeing her when you were present  on the contrary  your attention to her gave me pain  I was jealous of every look  I even saw her amiable qualities with a degree of envy  which checked the pleasure I should otherwise have found in her conversation       There is always  I fear  some injustice mixed with love  at least with love so ardent and tender as mine       You  my Rivers  will however pardon that injustice which is a proof of my excess of tenderness       Madame Des Roches has promised to write to me  indeed I will love her  I will conquer this little remain of jealousy  and do justice to the most gentle and amiable of women       Why should I dislike her for seeing you with my eyes  for having a soul whose feelings resemble my own       I have observed her voice is softened  and trembles like mine  when she names you       My Rivers  you were formed to charm the heart of woman  there is more pleasure in loving you  even without the hope of a return  than in the adoration of all your sex  I pity every woman who is so insensible as to see you without tenderness  This is the only fault I ever found in Bell Fermor  she has the most lively friendship for you  but she has seen you without love  Of what materials must her heart be composed       No other man can inspire the same sentiments with my Rivers  no other man can deserve them  the delight of loving you appears to me so superior to all other pleasures  that  of all human beings  if I was not Emily Montague  I would be Madame Des Roches       I blush for what I have written  yet why blush for having a soul to distinguish perfection  or why conceal the real feelings of my heart       I will never hide a thought from you  you shall be at once the confidant and the dear object of my tenderness       In what words my Rivers  you rule every emotion of my heart  dispose as you please of your Emily  yet  if you allow her to form a wish in opposition to yours  indulge her in the transport of returning you to your friends  let her receive you from the hands of a mother  whose happiness you ought to prefer even to hers       Why will you talk of the mediocrity of your fortune  have you not enough for every real want  much less  with you  would make your Emily blest  what have the trappings of life to do with happiness   tis only sacrificing pride to love and filial tenderness  the worst of human passions to the best       I have a thousand things to say  but am forced to steal this moment to write to you  we have some French ladies here  who are eternally coming to my apartment       They are at the door  Adieu   Yours   EMILY MONTAGUE     LETTER CXXXVIII   138   To the Earl of —   Silleri  May 12   IT were indeed  my Lord  to be wished that we had here schools  at the
