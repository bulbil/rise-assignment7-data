human mind  I cannot leave Belmont  I cannot give up the delight of beholding her  I fancy a softness in her manner which raises the most flattering ideas  she blushes when her eyes meet mine     Tho  I see the madness of hope  I indulge it in spite of myself  No one can deserve her  yet  as Lord          1 137       Belmont honors me with his esteem  I would persuade myself fortune alone forbids    I will struggle with impossibilities  I have many and powerful friends  we have a Prince in the early prime of life  the season of generous virtue  a Prince  to whom the patriot glow  and that disinterested loyalty  which is almost my whole inheritance  cannot but be the strongest recommendations  to him it may be merit to have suffered  when the basest of the people rose on the ruins of their country  Those ample possessions  which would have descended to me  and might have raised my hopes to the most angelic of womankind  were gloriously spent in endeavouring to support the throne  when shook by the rage of faction and narrow minded bigoted enthusiasm  the younger branch of our family escaped the storm by having a minor at it s head  to this accident  the partiality of an ancestor  and the military talents of his father  Lord Belmont owes        1 138       the affluence he so nobly enjoys  and which I only  of all mankind  have cause to regret      These circumstances raise a flattering hope    my views are confused  but I will pursue the track  If I succeed  I may openly avow my passion  if not  the secret of my love shall die with me  never  my friend  will I attempt her heart by unworthy means  let me endeavour to deserve  and leave to Heaven to determine whether I shall possess the noblest gift it has to bestow  Farewell     H  Mandeville      To George Mordaunt  Esq   August 1st      I Have heard from my father on the subject of Lady Mary s intended settlement  who extremely disapproves my intention of entirely declining it  which he thinks cannot be founded on any motives          1 139       worthy of me  but on a false pride of disdaining to be obliged  which is in this case unjust  and greatly below my character  that I might as well object to receiving a part of his estate  which he intends to settle on me at the same time  he says  Lord Belmont acts properly  and consistently with himself  and does not at all mean to break in on that independence which can never be too highly valued  that Lady Julia would scarce perceive such an addition to her already splendid fortune  whilst this settlement fixes in some degree of affluence the elder branch of the family  which lost its superiority  by the injustice of an ancestor  and that heroic loyalty which has ever characterised our house  That he will talk further with me on this subject when we meet  but in the mean time advises me  as a friend zealous for my interest  yet not the less attentive to my honor and the propriety of my conduct  to accept the immediate settlement of 500  L          1 140       a year  which will enable me to be serviceable to my country  but to postpone to some distant time settling the whole  and to insist that Lady Mary be convinced I deserve her friendship before she lavishes it so profusely on me      This advice gives me pleasure  as it coincides with my own present sentiments  eager to pursue my scheme of rising to such consequence as my justify my hopes of the only event desirable to me in this world  I am happy in the thought of appearing in every light in which I can attract the notice of my Prince  and  by steadily serving him and my country  whose true interest must ever be the same  deserve that favor on which all my designs are founded        The time not being yet arrived when I can serve the noblest cause in the Senate  I will go to Germany  and endeavour first to signalize myself in the manner most suited          1 141       to my period of life  the season of action  not of counsel  it is shameful  at my age  to recline in the flowery bower of indolence  when the whole world is in arms  I have not yet begun to live  my time has hitherto been less passed in acting  than in preparing to act  my part on the great theatre of human life      Oh  Mordaunt  should I succeed in my views  should the hour come when I may openly avow my passion for the  most lovely of womankind  this is the sweet hope which
