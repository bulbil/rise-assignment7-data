by the gipsy  when I apprehended   your design of the sham marriage  though there are other things I would   not have you see  but that is the worst  It can t be worse  said he  my   dear sauce box  than I have seen already  and I will allow your treating   me in ever so black a manner  on that occasion  because it must have a   very black appearance to you   Well  sir  said I  I think I will obey   you before night  But don t alter a word  said he  I won t  sir  replied   I  since you order it       While we were talking  Mrs  Jewkes came up  and said Thomas was   returned  O  said my master  let him bring up the papers  for he hoped    and so did I  that you had sent them by him  But it was a great balk    when he came up and said  Sir  Mr  Andrews did not care to deliver them    and would have it  that his daughter was forced to write that letter   to him  and  indeed  sir  said he  the old gentleman took on sadly  and   would have it that his daughter was undone  or else  he said  she would   not have turned back  when on her way   as I told him she did  said   Thomas   instead of coming to them  I began to be afraid now that all   would be bad for me again       Well  Tom  said he  don t mince the matter  tell me  before Mrs    Andrews  what they said  Why  sir  both he and Goody Andrews  after   they had conferred together upon your letter  madam  came out  weeping   bitterly  that grieved my very heart  and they said  Now all was over   with their poor daughter  and either she had written that letter by   compulsion  or had yielded to your honour  so they said  and was  or   would be ruined       My master seemed vexed  as I feared  And I said  Pray  sir  be so good   as to excuse the fears of my honest parents  They cannot know your   goodness to me       And so  said he  without answering me   they refused to deliver the   papers  Yes  and please your honour  said Thomas  though I told them    that you  madam  of your own accord  on a letter I had brought you  very   cheerfully wrote what I carried  But the old gentleman said  Why  wife    there are in these papers twenty things nobody should see but ourselves    and especially not the  squire  O the poor girl has had so many   stratagems to struggle with  and now  at last  she has met with one that   has been too hard for her  And can it be possible for us to account for   her setting out to come to us  and in such post haste  and  when she had   got above half way  to send us this letter  and to go back again of her   own accord  as you say  when we know that all her delight would have   been to come to us and to escape from the perils she had been so long   contending with  And then  and please your honour  he said  he could not   bear this  for his daughter was ruined  to be sure  before now  And so    said Thomas  the good old couple sat themselves down  and  hand in hand    leaning upon each other s shoulder  did nothing but lament   I was   piteously grieved  said he  but all I could say could not comfort them    nor would they give me the papers  though I told them I should deliver   them only to Mrs  Andrews herself  And so  and please your honour  I was   forced to come away without them       My good master saw me all bathed in tears at this description of your   distress and fears for me  and he said  I would not have you take on   so  I am not angry with your father in the main  he is a good man  and   I would have you write out of hand  and it shall be sent by the post to   Mr  Atkins  who lives within two miles of your father  and I ll enclose   it in a cover of mine  in which I ll desire Mr  Atkins  the moment it   comes to his hand  to convey it safely to your father or mother  and say   nothing of their
