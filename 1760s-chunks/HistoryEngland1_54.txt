to this  the male contents in England were too inconsiderable to attempt any thing further against the government  During this calm  the King endeavoured to efface the impressions of severity  which his conduct had made upon the people  by affecting a popularity and regard for the welfare of the subject  a never failing method to conciliate the affection of the English in favour of their sovereign  While he thus laboured  not without success  to retrieve the reputation he had lost  his son  the Prince of Wales  seemed bent upon incurring public aversion  he gave a loose to all kinds of debauchery  and was surrounded by a crew of profligate wretches  who made a practice of committing he most illegal acts of violence  The father was extremely mortified at this degeneracy in his eldest son  who had already exhibited repeated proofs of his valour  conduct  and generosity  virtues which he now seemed   159 to renounce  while the splenetic and gloomy trembled at the prospect of his succeeding to the throne  Nevertheless  in the midst of these excesses  the nobleness of his heart seemed  at intervals  to emerge from the gulph in which it was plunged  one of his dissolute companions  having been brought to trial for some misdemeanor  was condemned  notwithstanding all the interest he could make in his favour  and he was so exasperated at the issue of the trial  that he struck the Judge upon the bench  This magistrate  whose name was Sir William Gascoigne  behaved with the dignity that became his office  he forthwith ordered the Prince to be committed to prison  when this transaction was reported to the King  who was an excellent judge of mankind  he could not help exclaiming  in a transport of joy  Happy is the King  who has a magistrate endowed with courage to execute the laws upon such an offender  still more happy in having a son willing to submit to such chastisement   This  in fact  is one of the first great instances we read in the English history  of a magistrate doing justice in opposition to power  The government was now much changed from what it was in the times  even of Richard  where Judges were but the ministers of royal caprice   Henry did not long out live this interview  perceiving his end approach  he disposed his mind to the duties of devotion  and took the cross  fully determined to consecrate the remaining part of his life in fighting the cause of the pilgrims to Jerusalem  which was  at that time  considered as the cause of heaven  This is not the first instance we have seen of Princes endeavouring to strike up a bargain with Providence  and promising to perform   160 particular acts of devotion  upon being indulged with a longer period of existence  He imparted his design to a great council  assembled for that purpose  and began to make preparations for the expedition  when his disorder encreased to such a degree  that he was obliged to lay aside his intention  and think of a voyage of by far greater importance  As his constitution decayed  his fears of losing the crown redoubled  even to childish anxiety  he would not sleep  unless the royal diadem was laid upon his pillow  one day  being in a violent paroxysm of his disorder  the Prince of Wales took up the crown and carried it away  but  soon after  the King recovering his senses  and missing the crown  he asked what was become of it  and  understanding the Prince had carried it off     What   said the King to the Prince  with marks of indignation   would you rob me of my dignity before my death    No  replied the Prince   Thinking your Majesty was dead  I took the crown as my lawful inheritance  but  now I see you alive  I restore it with much more pleasure  and may God grant you many happy days to enjoy it in peace    So saying  he replaced the crown upon the pillow  and  having received his father s blessing  dutifully retired  The King was surprized with his last fit  at his devotions before the shrine of St  Edward the Confessor  in Westminster abbey  from whence he was carried to the Jerusalem chamber  When recovered from his swoon  perceiving himself in a strange place  he desired to know if the apartment had any particular name  being told of its appellation  he now concluded a prophecy fulfilled  which said  that he should die in Jerusalem  and  after some good instructions to his successor  he recommended   161 his soul to heaven  and soon after expired  on the twentieth day of March  in the forty sixth year of his age  and the fourteenth of his reign     Henry  whatever he might have been as a man  was certainly an excellent King  The government assumed both a form and liberty under his administration  the distinction between the nobility and the people was rendered less considerable  and the magistrates were less arbitrary and less venal   I am   c   LETTER XXII   THE death of Henry IV  gave his people but little affliction  among whom he never acquired any
