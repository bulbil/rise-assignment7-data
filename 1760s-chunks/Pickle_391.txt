had not only raised  him from indigence and scorn  to competence and reputable rank  but also  empowered him to obtain the possession of an excellent woman  who had  filled up the measure of his felicity   Peregrine declared himself already overpaid for all his good offices   by the pleasure he enjoyed in employing them  and the happy effects they  had produced in the mutual satisfaction of two persons so dear to his  affection  and assured his friend  that one time or other he would set  his conscience at ease  and remove the scruples of his honour  by having  recourse to his assistance  but at present he could not make use of his  friendship  without giving just cause of offence to honest Hatchway   who was prior to him in point of solicitation  and had manifested his  attachment with surprising obstinacy and perseverance   CHAPTER CII    Peregrine reconciles himself to the Lieutenant  and renews his  Connection with Society  Divers Plans are projected in his behalf  and  he has occasion to exhibit a remarkable Proof of Self denial   The captain  with reluctance  yielded the preference in this particular  to Jack  who was immediately invited to a conference  by a note  subscribed with Pickle s own hand  He was found at the prison gate  waiting for Gauntlet  to know the issue of his negotiation  He no sooner  received this summons  than he set all his sails  and made the best of  his way to his friend s apartment  being admitted by the turnkey  in  consequence of Peregrine s request  communicated by the messenger who   carried the billet  Pipes followed close in the wake of his shipmate   and  in a few minutes after the note had been despatched  Peregrine and  Gauntlet heard the sound of the stump  ascending the wooden staircase  with such velocity  that they at first mistook it for the application of  drumsticks to the head of an empty barrel  This uncommon speed  however   was attended with a misfortune  he chanced to overlook a small defect in  one of the steps  and his prop plunging into a hole  he fell backwards   to the imminent danger of his life  Tom was luckily at his back  and  sustained him in his arms  so as that he escaped without any other  damage than the loss of his wooden leg  which was snapped in the middle   by the weight of his body in falling  and such was his impatience  that  he would not give himself the trouble to disengage the fractured member   Unbuckling the whole equipage in a trice  he left it sticking in the  crevice  saying  a rotten cable was not worth heaving up  and  in  this natural state of mutilation  hopped into the room with infinite  expedition   Peregrine  taking him cordially by the hand  seated him upon one side of  his bed  and  after having made an apology for that reserve of which he  had so justly complained  asked if he could conveniently accommodate  him with the loan of twenty guineas  The lieutenant  without opening  his mouth  pulled out his purse  and Pipes  who overheard the demand   applying the whistle to his lips  performed a loud overture  in token of  his joy  Matters being thus brought to an accommodation  our hero told    6 22 15  3 45 PM   the captain  that he should be glad of his company at dinner  with their  common friend Hatchway  if he would in the meantime leave him to the  ministry of Pipes  and the soldier went away for the present  in order  to pay a short visit to his uncle  who at that time languished in a  declining state of health  promising to return at the appointed hour   The lieutenant  having surveyed the dismal appearance of his friend   could not help being moved at the spectacle  and began to upbraid  him with his obstinate pride  which  he swore  was no better than  self murder  But the young gentleman interrupted him in the course of  his moralizing  by telling him he had reasons for his conduct  which   perhaps  he would impart in due season  but  at present  his design was  to alter that plan of behaviour  and make himself some amends for the  misery he had undergone  He accordingly sent Pipes to redeem his clothes  from the pawnbroker s wardrobe  and bespeak something comfortable for  dinner  When Godfrey came back  he was very agreeably surprised to see  such a favourable alteration in his externals  for  by the assistance of  his valet  he had purified himself from the dregs of his distress  and  now appeared in a decent suit  with clean linen  while his face was  disencumbered of the hair that overshadowed it  and his apartment  prepared for the reception of company   They enjoyed their meal with great satisfaction  entertaining one  another with a recapitulation of their former adventures at the  garrison  In the afternoon  Gauntlet taking his leave  in order to write
