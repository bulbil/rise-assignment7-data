  with escaping that punishment which the offended laws inflict on        crimes of this nature  nor would it be in my power to shield you        from that fate which even the meanest and most abject of those        concerned with you must suffer            As I should be extremely sorry to see this  I beg you  for your own        sake  to be speedy in your resolution  which  as soon as you inform        me  I shall act accordingly  I am  yours   c            E  GOODMAN        This he ordered to be delivered to any one who should say they came from   Lady Mellasin  and Mrs  Prinks accordingly received it       Lady Mellasin  in the miserable circumstances to which she had reduced   herself  was transported to find she should not be entirely without   support  As for her being obliged to quit London  she was not in the   least shocked at it  as there was no possibility for her even to appear   publickly in it  and she was rather desirous  than averse  to be out of   a place which could no longer afford her those pleasures and amusements   she had once so much indulged herself in the enjoyment of       But when she considered on her banishment  and ran over in her mind what   part of England she should make choice of for her asylum  the whole   kingdom appeared a desert to her  when driven from the gaieties of the   court and capital  she therefore resolved to go farther  and enter into   a new scene of life  which might be more likely to obliterate the memory   of the former  She had heard much talk of Jamaica  that it was a rich   and opulent place  that the inhabitants thought of little else but how   to divert themselves in the best manner the country afforded  and that   they were not too strict in their notions either as to honour or   religion  that reputation was a thing littler regarded among them  so   that  in case the occasion that had brought her thither should happen to   be discovered  she would not find herself in the less estimation       She  therefore  hesitated not to write a second letter to Mr  Goodman    acquainting him with her desire to go to that plantation  and hinting to   him that  if it would be giving him too great a trouble to remit the   quarterly payments he mentioned  she should take it as a particular   favour if he would be pleased to bestow on her such a sum as he should   think proper  in lieu of the annuity he had offered       Mr  Goodman was extremely pleased with this proposal  and several   letters having passed between them concerning the conditions  he agreed   to give her two hundred pounds in specie  to provide herself with   sufficient necessaries for the voyage  and eight hundred more to be   deposited in the hands of the captain of the ship  to be paid on her   arrival  with which she appeared very well satisfied  and gave him the   most solemn assurances never to trouble him again       But Miss Flora was all distraction at this event  the thoughts of   leaving dear London were equally irksome to her with those of death   itself  Fain would she have staid behind  but what could she do  Without   reputation  without friends  without money  there was no remedy but to   share her mother s fortune  Mrs  Prinks also  who  by living so long   with Lady Mellasin  known to be in all her secrets  and agent in her   iniquitous proceedings  could have no character to recommend her to any   other service  continued with the only person she  indeed  was fit to   live with  and they all embarked together on board a ship that was then   ready to sail       All Mr  Goodman s friends congratulated him on the service he had done   his country  in ridding it of three persons who  by perverting the   talents Heaven had bestowed upon them  to the most vile purpose  were   capable of doing the greatest mischiefs to the more innocent and unwary    It was on this occasion that he made the invitation before mentioned                CHAPTER X       Returns to the affairs of Mrs  Munden          There were present at the entertainment made by Mr  Goodman  several   other of his friends  besides Sir Ralph and
