still farther a retreat of such elegance  he ordered several European seeds and fruits to be sown upon the island  which increased to such a surprising degree  that some Spaniards  who  several years after  landed there  and found them in plenty  could not avoid acknowledging this act of generosity and benevolence  Here the Commodore was joined by one ship more of his fleet  and by the Tryal frigate of seven guns  Advancing now northward  towards the tropic of Capricorn  he attacked the city of Payta by night  In this bold attempt he made no use of his ships  nor even landed all his men  A few soldiers landed by night  and filled the whole town with terror and confusion  The governor of the garrison  and the inhabitants  fled on all sides  accustomed to cruelty over a conquered enemy themselves  they expected a similitude of treatment  In the mean time  for three days  a small number of English kept possession of the town  and stripped it of all its treasures and merchandize  to an immense amount  Such of the negroes as had not fled were made use of in carrying the goods of their former masters on board the English shipping  and the Spaniards refusing to treat soon saw their town all in flames  This  however  was but a small punishment for all the cruelties which they had practised in taking possession of that country  upon its first inhabitants  The plunder of this place served to inrich the captors  and the ravage made among them  by the scurvy  still increased the share of every survivor  This small squadron now came up as far as Panama  situated on the Streights of Darien  Thus they   159 came upon on the western side of the great American continent  and Admiral Vernon was expcted to succeed on the opposite side nearer home  Thus the Spanish Empire was attacked on both sides  but the scheme failed from Vernon s want of success   Anson  who now only commanded two ships  the remainder having either put back to England  or  being wrecked by the tempests  bounded all his hopes to the taking one of those rich Spanish ships  which trade between the Philippine islands  near the coast of China and Mexico  on the Spanish main  But one or two  at the most  of these vessels passed from one continent to the other in a year  The ships are made immensely strong  large  and carry great quanties of treasure and merchandize  The Commodore therefore  and his little fleet  traversed that great ocean lying between the Asiatic and American continent  in hopes of meeting this rich prize  which it was hoped would  at this time of the year  return from the East  and would amply repay the adventurers for all their dangers and fatigues  Avarice thus became honourable when pursued through peril and distress  But the scurvy once more visited his mariners  now long kept at sea  and without fresh provisions  This disorder  though it takes the same name  is very different from that on land  The sea scurvy is attended with an universal putrefaction  the teeth loosen  old wounds that had been healed again open  and sometimes the limbs are seen to drop off at the joints  By this terrible disorder several of his men daily fell  and others were disabled  One of his ships becoming leaky  and the number of his hands decreasing  he thought proper to set it on fire in the midst of the ocean  His fleet now being reduced only to one ship  called the Centurion  of sixty guns  and all the crew in the most deplorable situation  he cast anchor on the deserted island of Tinian  which lies About half way between the old and new world    160 This island had some years before been peopled by near thirty thousand inhabitants  but an epidemical distemper coming among them  destroyed a part  and the rest forsook the place  Nothing  however  could exceed the beauty of this spot  The most romantic imagination cannot form a scene surpassing what Tinian naturally afforded  greens  groves  cascades  fields  flowers  and prospects  This retreat saved the English squadron  All that a sea beaten company of mariners could wish  they found here in great abundance  clear and wholesome water  medicinal herbs  domestic animals  and other necessaries for refitting their shattered vessel  Thus refreshed  he went forward towards China  passed by the kingdom of Formosa  and went up the river Canton in order to careen the only ship that now was left him  Being thus far on his way homeward  nothing can better testify the hardy and untameable spirit of the English  than his venturing once more back into the same ocean where he had experienced such a variety of distress  The Commodore having put his vessel into good order  by the assistance of the Chinese  and having taken Dutch and Indian sailors on board  he again returned towards America  At length  on the 9th of June  he discovered the galleon he so ardently expected  This vessel was formed as well for the purposes of war as of merchandize  It mounted sixty guns and five hundred men  while the crew of the Commodore did not exceed half that number  The engagement soon
