their way with no  ungallant show  The mind of Lord William was still gloomy and  disordered  He thought on his wife  the tenderness of her former love   the noble nature which all hen actions had invariably displayed   recurred to his mind  but now served only to aggiavate his despair  Her  strange and precipitate compliance with the desires of Raymond was  perplexing  but to be so soon forgotten was tormenting  and ever and  anon he unbosomed his distracted thoughts to the friendly Knight      Foolish and wretched is the man   thus would he exclaim         who builds his happiness on the frail and instable affection of woman  O  my friend  how securely did I conceive our loves to have been founded   how  firmly did her heart seem linked to mine  Can I forget the time  when  all the noble youth of England courted the smiles of the rich and  beautiful heiress of Earl Patrick  when her eyes marked me out as their  most worthy object  and her love graced my rising fame  Can I forget the  day when I was first  publickly distinguished by her favour  The solemn  jousts were prepared  the Knights glittered in their pompous array  we  were surrounded with all the beauties of the land  but our thoughts and  desires were fixed on Ela  How did I labour to engage her intention by  my gorgeous entry  Well do I remember the device which then adorned my  shield  and which my youthful pride had dictated  It was an eagle  towering in air  with his eyes fixed on the sun  and these words  beneath  NOT AKROGANT BUT CONSCIOUS OF NOBLENESS  We traversed the  lists in solemn state  and each champion  as he passed  made low  obeisance towards the place where Ela sat  but each unnoticed   till   William pacing proudly by  and paying the just homage to her high  beauty  suddenly she let fall the knot of ribbons which adorned her  lovely arm  I seized  kissed  and fixed it in my crest  and on that day  did my gallant deeds consess my zeal to merit her high regards  Many a  spear was bravely shivered  but  ere our appointed courses were  finished  a loud and sudden shriek assailed our affrighted ears  we  turned and saw the scaffold  where this fair dame was seated yielding  to its load  I burst like lightning to her rescue  and  amidst all the  officious and vigorous interposition of the croud  which the dangerous  incident had collected  this arm it was which saved her—And did our  loves decrease  Was my heart ever estranged  Was it one moment seduced  to any other object —And  yet  so soon to be forgotten  the false  tidings of my death so eagerly received         Randolph was studious to divert him from this melancholy subject   Revenge  he knew  was grateful to the high foul of William  and he  laboured to inspire him with hopes of a brave revenge  He spoke of the  arts that had been used to influence the weakness of widowed   unfriended  unassisted woman  of the craft of Hubert  and his iniquitous  abuse of the royal favour   But now   said he         the King shall know this minion  he shall know with what malicious  purpose of oppression and unjustice his false heart conceived  and his  false tongue uttered the lying tale of Earl William s death  and  speedily shall he execute the full vengeance due to the wounded honour  of his brave kinsman         —With eyes darting indignation  and sounds of disdain  the Earl replied   that his own influence and reputation in England  his noble friends and  numerous adherents  had made Kings  and that he relied on these much  more than on the justice of young Harry   Alas  said he       little can thy honest heart conceive of that crast and wily insinuation  with which this courtier hath wound himself to the heart of his easy  Prince  He alone directs and commands him  The noblest spirits of  England are insolently scorned  and the remotest corner of the realm  feels his pernicious influence          Good heaven   cried Randolph  still labouring to divert the Earl from  the gloomy subject which lay deeply fixed in his mind  and was ever  ready to rife and torment him       When shall our distracted country feel the blessings of a wife and  virtuous rule  shall faction and tumult for ever disturb the land  and  forbid avarice and slavish adulation for ever surround the throne  Is  the insolence of illgotten power to know no controul  Sad and gloomy is  the prospect —And yet  the spirits of my brave countrymen  tho   depressed and overborne  are still unbroken  They have already  contended  and they may again contend for the great prize of freedom   Perhaps  and
