had lived with him many years  came to him  scared and breathless  having ran himself almost dead to overtake his master   Oh  Sir  said he  for heaven’s sake  get away as fast as you can  Mr Bond’s family are all in an uproar  you will be taken  if you do not make your escape this instant   Have I killed any body  demanded Mr Faulkland   Oh  Sir  answered the man  you have killed my lady  and Major Smyth is mortally wounded   I know not what I did  cried Mr Faulkland  but I did not mean to hurt your mistress   I believe it  Sir  replied the servant  but I fear nobody else will  for that wicked wretch  though they think he cannot live many hours  would take away your life if he could  The report of the pistol alarmed the family  and we all ran into his room  gentry and servants and all  the major was able to speak  but my lady was quite dead   The account he gives is  that my lady’s candle having gone out she got up to get it lighted  and was endeavouring to find one of the maid’s rooms  when passing by his  and seeing a light  for he was but just got into bed  she stepped in  and before she had time to retire again  you rushed in like a madman  and seeing his pistols lie on the table  you snatched them both up  and discharged one at your lady  which killed her on the spot  you fired the other at him  while he was leaping out of bed  I am sure  Sir  this is a false story  yet  as the family may all believe it  I beg you on my knees  to provide for your safety  Miss Bond was tearing her hair for her lover  but I heard her say  she was glad that wicked woman  meaning my lady  had lost her life   They had sent off some of the people for a surgeon  and I ran as fast as I could to warn you of your dangers   This honest fellow  not contented with urging his master  soon saddled a very swift hunter  which he had in the stable  and Mr Faulkland  now convinced of the necessity of flying  mounted it directly  and  attended only by one groom  galloped off to Dublin  which he reached by seven o’clock in the morning  and was lucky enough to arrive just as a packet  which was going off with an express    was ready to sail  He went on board  and landed at Holly head in twelve hours  from thence  without stopping night or day  except to change horses  he rode post to London  and presented himself  in the manner I have already told you  before me     Such  my Cecilia  are the dismal particulars of this sad story  My brother staid with me ’till it was very late  our time was past in consulting on measures for Mr Faulkland’s preservation  He said  he would advise him  by all means  to get over to Holland as fast as he could  for if that story  which the execrable Smyth had invented  should be believed  and it was very likely to gain credit in case he died of his wound  and persevered in it to the last  Mr Faulkland  having no witness to disprove any part of the charge  would be in imminent danger of losing his life   I need not describe to you the horror in which I passed last night  I rose this morning at day light  and was but just dressed  when I was informed Mr Warner wanted to speak to me  I went down stairs to him directly   I could not sleep all night for thinking of your affairs  said he  without any previous salute  and I am so impatient to hear Faulkland’s story  that I could not rest ’till I came to you to be informed of it  for I suppose you heard every thing last night   I related all the particulars minutely as I have done to you  Mr Warner never once interrupting me  When I had ended the story  what do you intend for Faulkland  said my kinsman  I know not what to do  Sir  I replied  but this I am sure of  that if it were in the power of wealth to relieve his afflicted mind  he has an undoubted right to a large portion of the fortune I possess  this I think myself bound to bestow on the man  who  when I was destitute  offered me his  If we can prevail on him to take care of his own safety  which  when he is a little more collected  I hope we shall be able to do  I must entreat your assistance  Sir  in helping me to make him as easy as his unhappy circumstances will admit of —And is this all  demanded Mr Warner sternly  Does not your gratitude suggest a warmer recompence than giving him a paultry income   I was startled at the question  and not replying immediately  You must marry him  said he
