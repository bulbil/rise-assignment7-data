  exhorted him to follow his footsteps to the gate  where a hackney coach  stood for his reception  There being no time for hesitation  the painter  took his advice  and  without quitting the utensil  which in his hurry  he forgot to lay down  sallied out in the rear of our hero  with all the  wildness of terror and impatience which may be reasonably supposed to  take possession of a man who flies from perpetual imprisonment  Such was  the tumult of his agitation  that his faculty of thinking was for the  present utterly overwhelmed  and he saw no object but his conductor   whom he followed by a sort of instinctive impulse  without regarding the  keepers and sentinels  who  as he passed with his clothes under one arm   and his chamber pot brandished above his head  were confounded  and even  dismayed  at the strange apparition   During the whole course of this irruption  he ceased nor to cry  with  great vociferation   Drive  coachman  drive  in the name of God    and the carriage had proceeded the length of a whole street before he  manifested the least sign of reflection  but stared like the Gorgon s  head  with his mouth wide open  and each particular hair crawling  and twining like an animated serpent  At length  however  he began to  recover the use of his senses  and asked if Peregrine thought him  now out of all danger of being retaken  This unrelenting wag  not yet  satisfied with the affliction he imposed upon the sufferer  answered   with an air of doubt and concern  that he hoped they would not be  overtaken  and prayed to God they might not be retarded by a stop  of carriages  Pallet fervently joined in this supplication  and they  advanced a few yards farther  when the noise of a coach at full speed  behind them invaded their ears  and Pickle  having looked out of the  window  withdrew his head in seeming confusion  and exclaimed   Lord  have mercy upon us  I wish that may not be a guard sent after us   Methinks I saw the muzzle of a fusil sticking out of the coach   The  painter  hearing these tidings  that instant thrust himself half out  at the window  with his helmet still in his hand  bellowing to the  coachman  as loud as he could roar   Drive  d   ye  dive to the gates  of Jericho and the ends of the earth  Drive  you ragamuffin  you  rascallion  you hell hound  Drive us to the pit Of hell  rather than we  should be taken    Such a phantom could not pass without attracting the curiosity of the  people  who ran to their doors and windows  in order to behold this  object of admiration  With the same view  that coach  which was supposed  to be in pursuit of him  stopped just as the windows of each happened to  be opposite  and Pallet  looking behind  and seeing three men standing  upon the footboard armed with canes  which his fear converted into  fusils  never doubted that his friend s suspicion was just  but  shaking  his Jordan at the imaginary guard  swore he would sooner die than part  with his precious ware  The owner of the coach  who was a nobleman of  the first quality  mistook him for some unhappy woman deprived of her  senses  and  ordering his coachman to proceed  convinced the fugitive   to his infinite joy  that this was no more than a false alarm  He was  not  for all that  freed from anxiety and trepidation  but our young  gentleman  fearing his brain would not bear a repetition of the    6 22 15  3 45 PM   same joke  permitted him to gain his own lodgings without further  molestation   His landlady  meeting him on the stair  was so affected at his  appearance  that she screamed aloud  and betook herself to flight  while  he  cursing her with greet bitterness  rushed into the apartment to  the doctor  who  instead of receiving him with cordial embraces  and  congratulating him upon his deliverance  gave evident signs of umbrage  and discontent  and even plainly told him  he hoped to have heard that  he and Mr  Pickle had acted the glorious part of Cato  an event which  would have laid the foundation of such noble struggles  as could not  fail to end in happiness and freedom  and that he had already made  some progress in an ode that would have immortalised their names  and  inspired the flame of liberty in every honest breast   There   said  he   I would have proved  that great talents  and high sentiments of  liberty  do reciprocally produce and assist each other  and illustrated  my assertions with such notes and quotations from the Greek writers  as  would have opened the eyes of the most blind and unthinking  and touched  the most callous and obdurate heart   O fool
