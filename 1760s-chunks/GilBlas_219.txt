It seemed as if we should have a tight bout together  There were so many interrogatories to be bandied backwards and forwards  that question and answer rebounded like tennis balls  only with tenfold velocity   After having related our adventures each to other  and inquired into the actual condition of affairs  Phenicia asked me how I meant to provide for myself  My reply was  that I purposed  while waiting for something better  to get a situation with some young lady of quality  For shame  exclaimed my other self  you shall not think of such a thing  Is it possible  my darling  that you should not yet be disgusted with menial service  Are you not heartily sick of knocking under to the good or ill pleasure of others  of being cap in hand to all their caprices  and after all to be entertained with that unchangeable tune called a scolding  in a word  to be a downright slave  Why do not you follow my example  and turn your thoughts towards the stage  Nothing can be better suited to people of parts  when they happen not to be equally favoured in the articles of wealth and birth  It is a sphere of life which holds a middle rank between the nobility and mere tradespeople  a profession exempted from all troublesome restraint  and raised far above the common prejudices of humble and decent Society  The public are our bankers  and we draw upon them at sight  We live in a continual round of ecstacy  and spend our money to the full as fast as we earn it   The theatre  for she went on at a great rate  is favourable above all to women  When I lived with Florimonde  it is a misery to think of it  I was reduced to take up with the supernumeraries of the prince s company  not a single man of fashion paid the least attention to my figure  How came that about  Because they never got a glimpse of it The finest picture in the world may escape the admiration of the connoisseurs  if it is not placed in a proper light  But since I have been suitably framed and varnished  which could only happen in consequence of a theatrical finish  what a revolution  The finest young fellows of all the towns we pass through are shuffling at my heels  An actress therefore has all her little comforts about her  without deviating from the line of her duty  If she is discreet  by which we mean that she should not admit more than one lover into her good graces at a time  her exemplary conduct is cried up as without a parallel  She is called a very Niobe for her coldness  and when she changes her favourite  she is reprimanded as slightly by the world  as a lawful widow who marries a few weeks too soon after the death of her first husband  If  however  the widow should look for luck in odd numbers  and take to herself a third  the contempt of all mankind is poured down on her devoted head  she is considered as a monster of indelicacy  whereas we happier women are so much the more in vogue  as we add to the list of our favourites  After having been served up to a hundred different lovers  some battered nobleman finds us a dainty dish for himself   Do you mean that by way of news  interrupted I as she uttered the last sentiment  Do you imagine me to be ignorant of these advantages  I have often conned them over in my mind  and they are but too alluring to a girl of my character  The attractions of the stage would be irresistible  were inclination all  But some little talent is indispensable  and I have not a spark  I have sometimes attempted to rehearse passages from plays before Arsenia  She was never satisfied with my performance  and that disgusted me with the profession  You are easily put out of conceit with yourself  replied Phenicia  Do not you know that these great actresses are very apt to be jealous  With all their vanity  they are afraid lest some newer face should put them out of countenance  In short  I would not be guided by Arsenia on that subject  she did not give her real opinion  In my judgment  and without meaning to flatter you  the theatre is your natural element  You have admirable powers  free and graceful action  a fine toned voice  volubility of declamation  and such a turn of countenance  Ah  you little rogue  you will bring all the young fellows behind the scenes  if once you take to the boards   She plied me with many flattering compliments besides  and made me recite some lines  only by way of enabling me to form my own judgment as to my theatrical genius  Now that she was my censor  it seemed quite another thing  She praised me up to the skies  and held all the actresses in Madrid as mere makeweights in the scale  After such a testimony  it would have been inexcusable to hesitate about my own merit  Arsenia stood attainted  nay  convicted of jealousy and treachery  There could be no question about my being everything that was delightful  Two players happened to drop in by accident  and Phenicia prevailed on me
