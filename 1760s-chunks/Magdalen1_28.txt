happiest man in the world a little earlier   As you are kind enough to lament the occasion of this delay   replied the colonel   you can have no objection to make me acquainted with it—Shall I therefore beg  Sir Robert  to know the real motive of procrastinating matters  From the very great expedition used in the former part of this negotiation  a delay was what I little   167 looked for  and must confess that it not only surprizes but affects me—Louisa  Sir Robert  is very near my heart  and our s is a family which must not be insulted with impunity     You may naturally imagine  Charles  that this menacing speech  together with the air which accompanied it  was not at all calculated to work upon a temper like mine  I therefore surveyed the colonel with a look of cold indifference  and answered  that Louisa was to the full as close to my heart as she could possibly be to his  and as for resenting any insult which might be offered to the honour of his family  that was a circumstance which must raise him in every body s consideration   From the visible coldness of my reply  the colonel  I saw  endeavoured to rein in his temper  as well as he was   168 able  till he had more substantial grounds for indicating a resentment    Sir Robert   says he   excuse my warmth—I love my sister  and I feel for my family—gratify my impatience therefore in one word  and  like the man of honour I believe you to be  like the brother I hope to find you  tell me that neither has been injured by your means and I shall be the happiest man in the universe     Here  Melmoth  was a lunge which required all my ingenuity to parry  yet  when I considered that Louisa herself had published every thing between us  and when I saw the colonel must necessarily hear the whole story in the most aggravating light in a few hours  I thought it would look like the rankest cowardice to prevaricate  however it might wound my sensibility in the tenderest part to make mention   169 of any thing to the disadvantage of Louisa  Putting therefore the best face I possibly could upon the matter  I candidly told the colonel  that the excess of my passion for his sister had actually led me into an indiscretion which occasioned some uneasiness  that Louisa had  in consequence  been sent up to London  and that I was then on my journey after her  to fall at her feet  and to solicit a reconciliation —I added  that I flattered myself he would exert his interest in my favour  since there was no undoing what was done  and since that was the only means of restoring his sister s tranquility  and securing the honour of his family   There is no possibility  Melmoth  of painting the astonishment in which this relation threw the colonel  the surprize which he before manifested was nothing to that which now took the entire possession   170 of his countenance—At length  his wonder giving way to his indignation  a kind of fury seemed to flash from his eyes  and he fiercely leaned across the table  repeating  in a menacing accent    And so  Sir  you have actually ruined Louisa Mildmay     I don t know how it is  Melmoth  but there is something in the nature of guilt which takes away our fortitude  and reduces us to a state of the most contemptible timidity  You know I have as much courage as the generality of young fellows  and you know also what unhappy instances I have given of my knowledge in the weapons  yet  by all that s good  I could scarcely sustain the the terror of Mildmay s eye on this occasion—conscious how much right he had to be offended  Conscious of my own guilt  and lady Haversham s letter still ringing in my years  I shrunk in a   171 manner into myself  and seemed fearful of encountering the shock of his indignation  I sat dumb—irresolute—confounded—my vacant eye held rivetted to the floor  and such a visible agitation in my whole person as would have given the colonel but a poor idea of my spirit  had he not been already pretty well acquainted with my character  The colonel  however  soon gave me all my customary courage  by exclaiming that I was a villain  a cowardly  contemptible villain  who had basely made use of the most infamous arts to seduce the inexperienced innocence of a beautiful young lady  and to blast the reputation of a family  with which I was utterly unworthy to be connected  The colonel was proceeding in this manner  and giving an unbounded loose to a storm of incoherent fury  when I interrupted him — Colonel   says I    this is language with which I have been totally unacquainted    172 and it is language which would possibly cost you very dear  was I not sensible you have some cause to be offended with me  and  was I not desirous of shewing every regard which I am now able to manifest  both for the honour of your family and the peace of your beautiful sister —I grant my behaviour has been culpable
