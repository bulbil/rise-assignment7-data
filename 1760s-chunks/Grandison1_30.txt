madam—But who  pray  learns the language but with a view to understand the author   No body  I believe  Sir  But yet some who read the antients  may fail of understanding them  or at least  of improving by them  for every scholar  I presume  is not  necessarily  a man of sense   The Baronet was wicked here  in pointing by a laugh  as particular satire  what I meant but as general observation   But supposing the knowlege of these antients  continued I  as great as you please  is it not to be lamented  is it not  indeed  strange  that none of the modern learned  notwithstanding the advantage of their works  most of which they have taught to speak our language   notwithstanding the later important discoveries in many branches of science  notwithstanding a Revelation from Heaven  to which the religion of the Pagans was foolishness  and on which foolishness  however  I am told  most of the works of antiquity are founded     70 should have deserved a higher consideration in the comparison  than as pygmies to giants   I was going to say something farther  but the Baronet  by his loud applauses  disconcerted me  and I was silent   Proceed  madam —No triumph  no cause of triumph  here  Sir Hargrave —Pray  madam  proceed—You have not done  I perceive   I should be very glad  Sir  to have done  Pray change either the subject  or choose another disputant   Every one called upon me to proceed  and Mr  Walden urged me to say what I was going to say   But will you not  my Lucy  be glad of a little relief from this argument —Yes  say   Here then I conclude this Letter  to begin another  But it must be after I return from the play this night  or early in the morning before I go to church   LETTER XIII  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   URGED thus by every one  What I had further in my thoughts to say  resumed I  was from what I read in my Bible  The first man seems to have had an intuitive knowlege given him of almost all that concerned him to know  And his early descendants  while there was but one language  and long before the Greek and Roman sages existed  understood Husbandry and Music  were Artificers in Brass and Iron  built that surprising naval structure the Ark  attempted a yet greater piece of architecture  the Tower of Babel  and therefore must have had skill in many other parts of science which are not particularly mentioned   And so  madam  you really seem to think  that the knowlege we gather from the great antients is hardly worth the pains we take in acquiring the languages in which they wrote     71 Not so  Sir  I have great respect even for linguists  Do we not owe to them the translation of the sacred Books —But methinks I could wish that such a distinction should be made between language and science  as should convince me  that That confusion of tongues  which was intended for a punishment of presumption in the early ages of the world  should not be thought to give us our greatest glory in these more enlightened times   Well  madam  Ladies must be treated as Ladies  But I shall have great pleasure  on my return to Oxford  in being able to acquaint my learned friends  that they must all turn fine gentlemen and laughers  Mr  Reeves had smiled as well as the Baronet  and despise the great antients as men of straw  or very shortly they will stand no chance in the Ladies favour   Good Mr  Walden  Good Mr  Walden  laughed the Baronet  shaking his embroider d sides  let me  let me  beg your patience  while I tell you  that the young gentlemen at both Universities  are already in more danger of becoming fine gentlemen than fine scholars—And then again he laughed  and looking round him  bespoke  in his usual way  a laugh from the rest of the company   Mr  Reeves  a little touch d at the scholar s reference to him  in the word laughers  said  It were to be wish d  that in all nurseries of learning  the manners of youth were proposed as the principal end  It is too known a truth  said he  that the attention paid to languages  has too generally swallowed up all other and more important considerations  insomuch that sound morals and good breeding themselves  are obliged to give way to that which is of little moment  but as it promotes and inculcates those  And learned men  I am persuaded  if they dared to speak out  would not lay so much stress upon languages as you  Mr  Walden  seem to do   Learning here  reply d Mr  Walden  a little peevishly    72 has not a fair tribunal to be try d at  As it is said of the advantages of birth or degree  so it may be said of learning  No one despises it that has pretensions to it  But  proceed  Miss Byron
