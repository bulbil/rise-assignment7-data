 the gentleman s the triumphant  I pitty her too much for what may be the ease  to teaze her with my animadversions  especially after what she has suffered from the vile Sir Hargrave   By several hints in your Letters  it is impossible  my dear  that we can be beforehand with your inclinations  Young women in a beginning Love are always willing to conceal themselves from themselves  they are desirous to smother the fire  before they will call out for help  till it blazes  and frequently becomes too powerful to be extinguished by any help  They will call the passion by another name  as  gratitude  suppose  But  my Harriet  gratitude so properly sounded as yours   300 is  can be but another name for Love  The object so worthy  your own heart so worthy  consent of minds must bring it to Love on one side  perhaps on both  if the half score of Ladies you have heard of  are all of them but mere moderns  But that  my dear  is not to be supposed  since worthy hearts find out  and assimilate with  each other  Indeed  those Ladies may be such as are captivated with outward figure  An handsome man need not to have the great qualities of a Sir Charles Grandison  to engage the hearts of the generality of our Sex  But a good man  and an handsome man  if he has the vivacity that distinguishes Sir Charles  may marry whom he pleases  If we women love an handsome man  for the sake of our eye  we must be poor creatures indeed  if we love not good men  for the sake of our hearts   What makes us apprehensive for you  my Harriet is this  That we every one of us  are in Love ourselves with this fine young gentleman  Your uncle has fallen in with Mr  Dawson  an attorney of Nottingham  who acts for Sir Charles in some of his affairs  and gives him such a character  respecting his goodness to his tenants and dependents only  as will render credible all that even the fondest Love  and warmest gratitude  can say in his praise   We can hardly sometimes tell how to regret  tho  your accounts of your sufferings and danger cut us to the heart as we read them  the base attempt of Sir Hargrave  Were all to end as we wish  we should not regret it  But that  my Harriet  is our fear  What will become of me  said your grandmamma  if  at last  the darling of my heart should be entangled in an hopeless passion   If this is likely to be the case  while the fire I spoke of is but smothering  and while but here and there a spark escapes your strugging efforts to keep it down  resolve  my dear  to throw cold water on it  and quench it quite  And how is this to be done  but   301 by changing your personal friendship with the amiable family  into a correspondence by pen and ink  and returning to our longing arms  before the flame gets a head   When you are with us  you may either give hope to the worthy Orme  or encourage the proposal I inclose  as you please   As you are not capable of the mean pride of seeing a number of men in your train  and have always been uneasy at the perseverance of Mr  Fenwick and Mr  Greville—As you have suffered so much from the natural goodness of your heart  on the urgency of that honest man Sir Rowland Meredith in his nephew s favour  and still more from the baseness of that wicked Sir Hargrave—As your good character  and lovely person  engage you more and more admirers—And  lastly  As it would be the highest comfort that your grandmamma and your uncle  and I  and all your friends and well wishers  could know  to see you happily married—We cannot but wish for this pleasure and satisfaction  The sooner you give it to us  the better   But could there be any hope—You know what I mean—A royal diadem  my dear  would be a despicable thing in the comparison   Adieu  my best Love  You are called upon  in my opinion  to a greater trial than ever yet you knew  of that prudence for which you have hitherto been so much applauded by every one  and particularly by  Your truly maternal MARIANNA SELBY   LETTER XLI  From the Countess Dowager of D  To Mrs  SELBY  Inclosed in the preceding   Jan  23   GIVE me leave  madam  to address myself to you  tho  personally unknown  on a very particular   302 occasion  and  at the same time  to beg of you to keep secret  even from Mr  Selby  and the party to be named as still more immediately concerned in the subject  till I give my consent  as no one creature of my family  not even the Earl of D  my son  does  or shall from me  till you approve of it   My Lord has just entered into his twenty fifth year  There are not many better young men among the nobility
