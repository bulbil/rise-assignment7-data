Rock  none are more blest with the advantages of face than doctor Franks   And yet the great have their foibles as well as the little  I am almost ashamed to mention it  Let the foibles of the great rest in peace  Yet I must impart the whole to my friend  These two great men are actually now at variance  yes  my dear Fum Hoam  by the head of our grandfather  they are now at variance like mere men  mere common mortals  The champion Rock advises the world to beware of bog trotting quacks  while Franks retorts the wit and the sarcasm  for they have both a world of wit  by fixing on his rival the odious appellation of Dumplin Dick  He calls the serious doctor Rock  Dumplin Dick  Head of Confucius  what profanation  Dumplin Dick  What a pity  ye powers  that the learned  who were born mutually to assist in enlightening the world  should thus differ among themselves  and make even the profession ridiculous  Sure the world is wide enough  at least  for two great personages to figure in  men of science should leave controversy to the little world   14 below them  and then we might see Rock and Franks walking together hand in hand  smiling onward to immortality   Next to these is doctor Walker  preparator of his own medicines  This gentleman is remarkable for an aversion to quacks  frequently cautioning the public to be careful into what hands they commit their safety  by which he would insinuate that if they do not employ him alone  they must be undone  His public spirit is equal to his success  Not for himself  but his country  is the gally pot prepared and the drops sealed up with proper directions for any part of the town or country  All this is for his country s good  so that he is now grown old in the practice of physic and virtue  and to use his own elegance of expression  There is not such another medicine as his in the world again   This  my friend  is a formidable triumvirate  and yet  formidable as they are  I am resolved to defend the honour of Chinese physic against them all  I have made a vow to summon doctor Rock to a solemn disputation in all the mysteries of the profession  before the face of every Philomath  student in astrology  and member of the learned societies  I adhere to  and venerate the doctrines of old Wang shu ho  In the very teeth of opposition I will maintain   That the heart is the son of the liver  which has the kidneys for its mother  and the stomach for its wife  I have therefore drawn up a disputation challenge  which is to be sent speedily  to this effect   I  Lien Chi Altangi  D  N  R  P  native of Honan in China  to Richard Rock  F  U  N  native of Garbage alley in Wapping  defiance  Though  Sir  I   15•m perfectly sensible of your importance  though no •ranger to your studies in the paths of nature  yet •ere may be many things in the art of physic with •hich you are yet unacquainted  I know full well • doctor thou art  great Rock  and so am I  Wherefore I challenge  and do hereby invite you • a trial of learning upon hard problems  and ••otty physical points  In this debate we will •almly investigate the whole theory and practice of •edicine  botany and chymistry  and I invite all •he philomaths  with many of the lecturers in me•icine  to be present at the dispute  which  I hope  •ill be carried on with due decorum  with proper •ravity  and as befits men of erudition and sci•nce  among each other  But before we meet face • face  I would thus publickly  and in the face of ••e whole world  desire you to answer me one •uestion  I ask it with the same earnestness with •hich you have often solicited the public  answer •e  I say  at once  without having recourse to our physical dictionary  which of those three disor•ers  incident to the human body  is the most fa•l  the syncope  parenthesis  or apoplexy  I beg your ••ply may be as public as this my demand   I am  • hereafter may be  your admirer  or your rival   Adieu   LETTER LXVI  To the same   •NDULGENT nature seems to have exempted this island from many of those epidemic ••tils which are so fatal in other parts of the   16 world  A want of rain but for a few days beyond the expected season in China  spreads famine  desolation  and terror  over the whole country  the winds that blow from the brown bosom of the western desart are impregnated with death in every gale  but in this fortunate land of Britain  the inhabitant courts health in every breeze  and the husbandman ever sows in joyful expectation   But tho  the nation be exempt from real evils  think not  my friend  that it is more happy on this account than others  They are afflicted  it is true  with neither famine nor pestilence  but then there is
