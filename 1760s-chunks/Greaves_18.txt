without having any words with Mr  Darnel  who was also present  But in the morning he visited that proud neighbour betimes  and they had almost reached a grove of trees on the north side of the town  when they were suddenly overtaken by half a dozen gentlemen  who had watched their motions  It was in vain for them to dissemble their design  which could not now take effect  They gave up their pistols  and a reconciliation was patched up by the pressing remonstrances of their common friends  but Mr  Darnel s hatred still rankled at bottom  and soon broke out in the sequel  About three months after this transaction  his niece Aurelia  with her mother  having been to visit a lady in the chariot  the horses being young  and not used to the traces  were startled at the braying of a jackass on the common  and  taking fright  ran away with the carriage  like lightning  The coachman was thrown from the box  and the ladies screamed piteously for help  Mr  Greaves chanced to be a horseback on the other side of an enclosure  when he heard their shrieks  and riding up the hedge  knew the chariot  and saw their disaster  The horses were then running full speed in such a direction  as to drive headlong over a precipice into a stone quarry  where they and the chariot  and the ladies  must be dashed to pieces    You may conceive  gemmen  what his thoughts were when he saw such a fine young lady  in the flower of her age  just plunging into eternity  when he saw the lovely Aurelia on the brink of being precipitated among rocks  where her delicate limbs must be mangled and tore asunder  when he perceived  that  before he could ride round by the gate  the tragedy would be finished  The fence was so thick and high  flanked with a broad ditch on the outside  that he could not hope to clear it  although he was mounted on Scipio  bred out of Miss Cowslip  the sire Muley  and his grandsire the famous Arabian Mustapha —Scipio was bred by my father  who would not have taken a hundred guineas for him  from any other person but the young squire—indeed  I have heard my poor father say ——  By this time Ferret s impatience was become so outrageous  that he exclaimed in a furious tone   D—n your father  and his horse  and his colt into the bargain    Tom made no reply  but began to strip with great expedition  Captain Crowe was so choked with passion that he could utter nothing but disjointed sentences  He rose from his seat  brandished his horsewhip  and  seizing his nephew by the collar  cried   Odd s heartlikins  sirrah  I have a good mind—Devil fire your running tackle  you landlubber — can t you steer without all this tacking hither and thither  and the Lord knows whither — Noint my block  I d give thee a rope s end for thy supper if it wan t ——  Dolly had conceived a sneaking kindness for the young lawyer  and thinking him in danger of being roughly handled  flew to his relief  She twisted her hand in Crowe s neckcloth without ceremony  crying   Sha t then  I tell thee  old codger—who kears a vig vor thy voolish tantrums    While Crowe looked black in the face  and ran the risk of strangulation under the gripe of this Amazon  Mr  Clarke having disengaged himself of his hat  wig  coat  and waistcoat  advanced in an elegant attitude of manual offence towards the misanthrope  who snatched up a gridiron from the chimney corner  and Discord seemed to clap her sooty wings in expectation of battle  But as the reader may have more than once already cursed the unconscionable length of this chapter  we must postpone to the next opportunity the incidents that succeeded this denunciation of war             CHAPTER FOUR  IN WHICH IT APPEARS THAT THE KNIGHT  WHEN HEARTILY SET IN FOR SLEEPING  WAS NOT EASILY DISTURBED   In all probability the kitchen of the Black Lion  from a domestic temple of society and good fellowship  would have been converted into a scene or stage of sanguinary dispute  had not Pallas  or Discretion  interposed in the person of Mr  Fillet  and  with the assistance of the ostler  disarmed the combatants  not only of their arms  but also of their resentment   The impetuosity of Mr  Clarke was a little checked at sight of the gridiron  which Ferret brandished with uncommon dexterity  a circumstance from whence the company were  upon reflection  induced to believe  that before he plunged into the sea of politics  he had occasionally figured in the character of that facetious droll  who accompanies your itinerant physicians  under the familiar appellation of Merry Andrew  or Jack Pudding  and on a wooden stage entertains the populace with a solo on the saltbox  or a sonata on the tongs and gridiron  Be that as it may  the young lawyer seemed to be a little discomposed at the glancing of this extraordinary weapon of offence  which the fair hands of Dolly had scoured  until it
