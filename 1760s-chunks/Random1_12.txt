his generosity   ON our way back to the village  my uncle spoke not a word during the space of a whole hour  but whistled with great vehemence  the tune of  Why should we quarrel for riches   c  his visage being contracted all the while into a most formidable srown  At length his pace was increased to such a degree  that I was often left behind a considerable way  which when he perceived  he would wait for me  and when I was almost up with him  call out in a surly tone     Bear a hand  damme —must I bring to every minute for you  you lazy dog  —  Then laying hold of me by the arm  haul me along  until his good nature  of which he had a good share  and reflection  getting the better of his passion  he would say    Come  my boy  don t be cast down —the old rascal is in hell —that s some satisfaction —you shall go to sea with me  my lad —A light heart and a thin pair of breeches  goes thro  the world  brave boys  as the song goes—eh  —  Though this proposal did   24 not at all suit my inclination  I was afraid of discovering my aversion to it  lest I should disoblige the only friend I had in the world  and he was so much a seaman  that he never dreamt I could have any objection to his design  consequently  gave himself no trouble in consulting my approbation  But this resolution was soon dropt  at the advice of our usher  who assured Mr  Bowling  it would be a thousand pities to baulk my genius  which would certainly  one day  make my fortune on shore  provided it received due cultivation —Upon which  this generous tar determined  though he could ill afford it  to give me university education  and accordingly  settled my board and other expences  at a town not many miles distant  famous for its colleges  whither we repaired in a short time —But before the day of our departure  the school master  who no longer had the fear of my grandfather before his eyes  laid aside all decency and restraint  and not only abused me in the grossest language his rancour could suggest  as a wicked profligate  dull  beggarly miscreant  whom he had taught out of charity  but also inveighed in the most bitter manner against the memory of the judge  who by the bye had procured that settlement for him  hinting  in pretty plain terms  that the old gentleman s soul was damn d to all eternity  for his injustice in neglecting to pay for my learning —This brutal behaviour  added to the sufferings I had formerly undergone  made me think it high time to be revenged of this insolent pedagogue  Having consulted my adherents  I found them all staunch in their promises to stand by me  and our scheme was this —In the afternoon preceeding the day of departure for the university  I   25 was to take the advantage of the usher s going out to make water  which he regularly did at four o clock  and shut the great door  that he might not come to the assistance of his superior  This being done  the assault was to be begun  by my advancing to the master and spitting in his face  I was to be seconded by two of the strongest boys in the school  who were devoted to me  their business was to join me in dragging the tyrant to a bench  over which he was to be laīd  and his bare posteriors heartily flogged with his own birch  which we proposed to wrest from him in the struggle  but if we should find him too many for us all three  we were to demand the assistance of our competitors  who should be ready to reinforce us  or oppose any thing that might be undertaken by the rest of the boys for the master s relief  One of my principal assistants was called Jeremy Gawky  son and heir of a wealthy gentleman in the neighbourhood  and the name of the other  Hugh Strap  the cadet of a family which had given shoemakers to the village time out of mind —I had once saved Gawky s life  by plunging into a river where he was on the point of being drowned  and by the help of swimming  dragging him ashore  I had often rescued him from the clutches of those whom his insufferable arrogance had provoked  to a resentment he was not able to sustain —and I had many times saved his reputation and posteriors  by performing his exercises at school  so that it is not to be wondered at  if he had a particular regard for me and my interests  The attachment of Strap  flowed from a voluntary  disinterested inclination  which had manifested itself on many occasions in my behalf  having once rendered me   26 the same service as I had afforded to Gawky  by saving my life at the risk of his own  and often fathered offences I had committed  for which he suffered severely  rather than I should feel the the weight of the punishment I deserved —These two champions were the more willing to engage in this enterprize
