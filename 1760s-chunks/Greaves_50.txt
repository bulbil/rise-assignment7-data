some time  and repeated the demand before witnesses  it was not yet produced  Mr  Clarke then  in a solemn tone  gave the jailor to understand  that an officer refusing to deliver a true copy of the commitment warrant was liable to the forfeiture of one hundred pounds for the first offence  and for the second to a forfeiture of twice that sum  besides being disabled from executing his office   Indeed  it was no easy matter to comply with Sir Launcelot s demand  for no warrant had been granted  nor was it now in the power of the justice to remedy this defect  as Mr  Ferret had taken himself away privately  without having communicated the name and designation of the prisoner  A circumstance the more mortifying to the jailor  as he perceived the extraordinary respect which Mr  Clarke and the captain paid to the knight  and was now fully convinced that he would be dealt with according to law  Disordered with these reflections  he imparted them to the justice  who had in vain caused search to be made for Ferret  and was now extremely well inclined to set the knight and his friends at liberty  though he did not at all suspect the quality and importance of our adventurer  He could not  however  resist the temptation of displaying the authority of his office  and therefore ordered the prisoners to be brought before his tribunal  that  in the capacity of a magistrate  he might give them a severe reproof  and proper caution with respect to their future behaviour   They were accordingly led through the street in procession  guarded by the constable and his gang  followed by Crabshaw  who had by this time been released from the stocks  and surrounded by a crowd of people  attracted by curiosity  When they arrived at the justice s house  they were detained for some time in the passage  then a voice was heard  commanding the constable to bring in the prisoners  and they were introduced to the hall of audience  where Mr  Gobble sat in judgment  with a crimson velvet night cap on his head  and on his right hand appeared his lady  puffed up with the pride and insolence of her husband s office  fat  frouzy  and not over clean  well stricken in years  without the least vestige of an agreeable feature  having a rubicund nose  ferret eyes  and imperious aspect  The justice himself was a little  affected  pert prig  who endeavoured to solemnise his countenance by assuming an air of consequence  in which pride  impudence  and folly were strangely blended  He aspired at nothing so much as the character of an able spokesman  and took all opportunities of holding forth at vestry and quarter sessions  as well as in the administration of his office in private  He would not  therefore  let slip this occasion of exciting the admiration of his hearers  and  in an authoritative tone  thus addressed our adventurer —   The laws of this land has provided—I says as how provision is made by the laws of this here land  in reverence to delinquems and malefactors  whereby the king s peace is upholden by we magistrates  who represents his majesty s person  better than in e er a contagious nation under the sun  but  howsomever  that there king s peace  and this here magistrate s authority cannot be adequably and identically upheld  if so be as how criminals escapes unpunished  Now  friend  you must be confidentious in your own mind  as you are a notorious criminal  who have trespassed again the laws on divers occasions and importunities  if I had a mind to exercise the rigour of the law  according to the authority wherewith I am wested  you and your companions in iniquity would be sewerely punished by the statue  but we magistrates has a power to litigate the sewerity of justice  and so I am contented that you should be mercifully dealt withal  and even dismissed    To this harangue the knight replied  with a solemn and deliberate accent   If I understand your meaning aright  I am accused of being a notorious criminal  but nevertheless you are contented to let me escape with impunity  If I am a notorious criminal  it is the duty of you  as a magistrate  to bring me to condign punishment  and if you allow a criminal to escape unpunished  you are not only unworthy of a place in the commission  but become accessory to his guilt  and  to all intents and purposes  socius criminis  With respect to your proffered mercy  I shall decline the favour  nor do I deserve any indulgence at your hands  for  depend upon it  I shall show no mercy to you in the steps I intend to take for bringing you to justice  I understand that you have been long hackneyed in the ways of oppression  and I have seen some living monuments of your inhumanity—of that hereafter  I myself have been detained in prison  without cause assigned  I have been treated with indignity  and insulted by jailors and constables  led through the streets like a felon  as a spectacle to the multitude  obliged to dance attendance in your passage  and afterwards branded with the name of notorious criminal —I now demand to
