lodgings in the house of a   clergyman  who  besides the character of a man of learning  was   also reputed to be in good circumstances  I soon found that he   was a person exactly fitted for my designs  and therefore lost no   time in making a proper impression on him  The first step towards   acquiring confidence is to place it yourself  I immediately made   him my banker  lodging every sum of money I won at play  or raised   by the means I mentioned before  in his hands  As my success   made these sums very considerable at first  he conceived an opinion   of my being a person of consequence and fortune above my appear    ance  This inspired him with such respect for me  that if at any   time I even hinted an occasion for more than I had in his hands    he not only offered to supply me  but even looked upon my accept    ance as an honour  To confirm him in this way of thinking  I   frequently accepted of his offers when I had no occasion  only Siat   the punctuality of my payment might make him still the readier   whenever I should  Nor was it long before I was obliged to avail   myself of this scheme  A bad run at play stripped me of all my   money  and my tradesmen brought in their bills  so that my former   resources were at an end  In this difficulty I applied to my land    lord  who readily supplied me with all the money in his possession    and  that not being sufficient  borrowed as much more as he could    till my remittances should arrive from my estate        This supply might have extricated me from the difficulties of   the present moment  But I was awoke from my golden dreams    and saw that this was the last money I could anyways expect to   raise  as my practices began to be suspected  and everybody had   taken the alarm against me   so that  if I parted with it  I should   only gain a momentary relief  as my landlord would soon expect   to be paid also  I therefore resolved to serve all my creditors alike    and go back to Germany with the money in my possession  leaving   them to cuise their credulity  and be more cautious for the future    As I had still a considerable quantity of valuable effects in my   possession  I knew it would be impossible to remove them without   giving the alarm to my landlord  and I could not think of leaving   them in his hands  though they were far short of the debt I owed   him  In this dilemma my ready genius prompted a scheme that   would not only secure me from him  but also give me time to prepare   for my decampment vrith more convenience  Upon my first coming         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 273     to his house  I had contrived  by taking the impressions in wax  to   get false keys to all his locks  This is a piece of precaution which   no man of prudence will ever neglect  In pursuance of my scheme    the morning after I received the money from him  and before I was   to pay it away by appointment  I took the opportunity while he   was at church to convey into his closet several things of value  my   property in which I could clearly prove  taking away  at the same   time  the obligations which I had given him for the money he had   lent me  which his confidence in my honour had prevented his   taking the precaution of having witnesses to  As soon as I had done   this  I went directly to a magistrate  before whom I made oath of   my being robbed of a large sum of money and many of my most   valuable effects  among which I particularly named the things I   had left in his closet  and required an authority to apprehend my   landlord and search his house  as I had reason to suspect that he   had stolen them  having caught liim often coming out of my apart    ments in evident confusion  and at times when my being absent   deprived him of every honest reason of going into them   and this   charge I had confirmed by the testimony of my valet de chambre   and another person  whom I had prepared properly        Though the execution of sentence is not quite so sudden in   England as in Turkey  an accusation of this kind  however ground    less  is in many respects not much less dreadful  the harpies of the   law never losing their hold of the accused till they have devoured   everything in his possession  The warrant I demanded was readily
