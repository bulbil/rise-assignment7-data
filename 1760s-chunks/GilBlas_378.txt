And yet it turned out better than my hopes or deserts  for Don Juan s sister received me so graciously  as to put me in good humour with myself  I was charmed with the turn of her mind  and foreboded that with discreet management and much deference  I might really get her to like me as well as anybody else  Full of this sweet hope I sent for the lawyers to draw up the two contracts  and for the clergyman of Paterna  to bring us better acquainted with our mistresses   Thus did I light the torch of Hymen for the second time  and it did not burn blue with the brimstone of repentance  Dorothea  like a virtuous wife  made a pleasure of her duty  in gratitude for the pains I took to anticipate all her wishes  she soon loved me as well as if I had been younger  Don Juan and my god daughter were most enthusiastic in their mutual ardour  and what was most unprecedented of all  the two sisters in law loved one another sincerely  Don Juan was a man in whom all good qualities met  my esteem for him increased daily  and he did not repay it with ingratitude  In short  we were a happy and united family  we could scarcely bear the interval of separation between evening and morning  Our time was divided between Lirias and Jutella  his excellency s pistoles made the old battlements to raise their heads again  and the castle to resume its lordly port   For these three years  reader  I have led a life of unmixed bliss in this beloved society  To perfect my satisfaction  heaven has deigned to send me two smiling babes  whose education will be the amusement of my declining years  and if ever husband might venture to hazard so bold an hypothesis  I devoutly believe myself their father   THE END        The End
