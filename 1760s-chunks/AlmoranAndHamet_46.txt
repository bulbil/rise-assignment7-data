thy life may yet be preserved  but it can be preserved   only by a charm  which HAMET must apply   ALMORAN  who had raised his   eyes  and conceived some languid hope  when he heard that he might yet   live  cast them again down in despair  when he heard that he could   receive life only from HAMET   From HAMET   said he   I have already   taken the power to save me  I have  by thy counsel  given him the   instrument of death  which  by thy counsel also  I urged him to use  he   received it with joy  and he is now doubtless numbered with the dead      HAMET   said the Genius   is not dead  but from the fountain of virtue   he drinks life and peace  If what I shall propose  he refuses to   perform  not all the powers of earth  and sea  and air  if they should   combine  can give thee life  but if he complies  the death  that is now   suspended over thee  shall fall upon his head  and thy life shall be   again delivered to the hand of time    Make haste then   said ALMORAN     and I will here wait the event    The event   said the Genius   is not   distant  and it is the last experiment which my power can make  either   upon him or thee  when the star of the night  that is now near the   horizon  shall set  I will be with him        When ALMORAN was alone  he reflected  that every act of supernatural   power which the Genius had enabled him to perform  had brought upon him   some new calamity  though it always promised him some new advantage  As   he would not impute this disappointment to the purposes for which he   employed the power that he had received  he indulged a suspicion  that   it proceeded from the perfidy of the Being by whom it was bestowed  in   his mind  therefore  he thus reasoned with himself   The Genius  who has   pretended to be the friend of ALMORAN  has been secretly in confederacy   with HAMET  why else do I yet sigh in vain for ALMEIDA  and why else did   not HAMET perish  when his life was in my power  By his counsel  I   persuaded HAMET to destroy himself  and  in the very act  I was betrayed   to drink the potion  by which I shall be destroyed  I have been led on    from misery to misery  by ineffectual expedients  and fallacious hopes    In this crisis of my fate  I will not trust  with implicit confidence    in another  I will be present at the interview of this powerful  but   suspected Being  with HAMET  and who can tell  but that if I detect a   fraud  I may be able to disappoint it  however powerful  he is not   omniscient  I may  therefore  be present  unknown and unsuspected even   by him  in a form that I can chuse by a thought  to which he cannot be   conscious                 CHAP  XIX          In consequence of this resolution  ALMORAN  having commanded one of the   soldiers of the guard that attended upon HAMET into an inner room of the   palace  he ordered him to wait there till his return  then making fast   the door  he assumed his figure  and went immediately to the dungeon    where producing his signet  he said  he had received orders from the   king to remain with the prisoner  till the watch expired       As he entered without speaking  and without a light  HAMET continued   stretched upon the ground  with his face towards the earth  and ALMORAN    having silently retired to a remote corner of the place  waited for the   appearance of the Genius       The dawn of the morning now broke  and  in a few minutes  the prison   shook  and the Genius appeared  He was visible by a lambent light that   played around him  and HAMET starting from the ground  turned to the   vision with reverence and wonder  but as the Omnipotent was ever present   to his mind  to whom all beings in all worlds are obedient  and on whom   alone he relied for protection  he was neither confused nor afraid     HAMET   said the Genius   the crisis of thy fate is near    Who art   thou   said HAMET  and for what purpose art thou come    I am   replied   the Genius
