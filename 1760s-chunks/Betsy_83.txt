to reconcile to each other two such worthy persons  What effect his   endeavours  or rather their own nobleness of sentiments produced  shall   presently be shewn                CHAPTER XXIII       Among other things necessary to be told  gives an account of the   success of a plot laid by Mr  Chatfree  for the discovery of Miss   Betsy s real sentiments          Though Mr  Goodman had as yet no intimations of the accidents of that   morning  yet was he extremely uneasy  the looks  as well as words of Mr    Staple  in going of his house the day before  were continually in his   mind  and he could not forbear apprehending some fatal consequence   would  one time or another  attend the levity of Miss Betsy s behaviour   and conduct  in regard to her admirers  he was also both surprized and   vexed  that Mr  Bloomacre  from whom he expected an explanation of the   Westminster Abbey adventure  had not come according to his request  This   last motive of his disquiet was  however  soon removed  Mr  Bloomacre    who was no less impatient to clear himself of all blame concerning the   transactions of that night  had no sooner finished his affair with Lord         and was dismissed by the high bailiff  than he came directly to   Mr  Goodman s  and recited to him  and all the ladies  the whole of what   had passed       Miss Betsy laughed prodigiously  but Mr  Goodman shook his head  on   hearing the particulars related by Mr  Bloomacre  and  after that   gentleman was gone  reproved  as he thought it his duty to do  the   inconsiderateness of her conduct  he told her  that as she was alone    she ought to have left the Abbey as soon as divine service was ended    that  for a person of her sex  age  and appearance  to walk in a place   where there were always a great concourse of young sparks  who came for   no other purpose than to make remarks upon the ladies  could not but be   looked on as very odd by all who saw her   There was no rain   said he     till a long time after the service was ended  and you might then  in   all probability  have got a chair  or if not  the walk over the Park   could not have been a very great fatigue        Miss Betsy blushed extremely  not through a conscious shame of imagining   what she had done deserved the least rebuke  but because her spirit  yet   unbroke  could not bear control  she replied  that as she meant no ill    those who censured her were most in fault   That is very true   answered   Mr  Goodman   but  my dear child  you cannot but know it is a fault   which too many in the world are guilty of  I doubt not of your   innocence  but would have you consider  that reputation is also of some   value  that the honour of a young maid  like you  is a flower of so   tender and delicate a nature  that the least breath of scandal withers   and destroys it  In fine  that it is not enough to be good  without   behaving in such a manner as to make others acknowledge us to be so        Miss Betsy had too much understanding not to be sensible what her   guardian said on this occasion was perfectly just  and also that he had   a right to offer his advice whenever her conduct rendered it necessary    but could not help being vexed  that any thing she did should be liable   to censure  as she thought it merited none  she made no farther reply    however  to what Mr  Goodman said  though he continued his   remonstrances  and probably would have gone on much longer  if not   interrupted by the coming in of Mr  Chatfree  This gentleman having   parted from the two wounded rivals  came directly to Mr  Goodman s  in   order to see how Miss Betsy would receive the intelligence he had to   bring her       After paying his compliments to Mr  Goodman  and the other ladies  he   came towards Miss Betsy  and looking on her with a more than ordinary   earnestness in his countenance   Ah  Madam   said he   I shall never   hereafter see you without remembering what Cowley says of a lady who   might  I suppose  be like you             So fatal  and withal so
