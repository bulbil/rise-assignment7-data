us  But we would sooner live upon the   water  and  if possible  the clay of the ditches I contentedly dig  than   live better at the price of our child s ruin       I hope the good  squire has no design  but when he has given you so much   money  and speaks so kindly to you  and praises your coming on  and  oh    that fatal word  that he would be kind to you  if you would do as you   should do  almost kills us with fears       I have spoken to good old widow Mumford about it  who  you know  has   formerly lived in good families  and she puts us in some comfort  for   she says it is not unusual  when a lady dies  to give what she has about   her person to her waiting maid  and to such as sit up with her in her   illness  But  then  why should he smile so kindly upon you  Why should   he take such a poor girl as you by the hand  as your letter says he has   done twice  Why should he stoop to read your letter to us  and commend   your writing and spelling  And why should he give you leave to read his   mother s books   Indeed  indeed  my dearest child  our hearts ache for   you  and then you seem so full of joy at his goodness  so taken with   his kind expressions   which  truly  are very great favours  if he   means well  that we fear  yes  my dear child  we fear  you should be too   grateful   and reward him with that jewel  your virtue  which no riches    nor favour  nor any thing in this life  can make up to you       I  too  have written a long letter  but will say one thing more  and   that is  that  in the midst of our poverty and misfortunes  we have   trusted in God s goodness  and been honest  and doubt not to be happy   hereafter  if we continue to be good  though our lot is hard here  but   the loss of our dear child s virtue would be a grief that we could not   bear  and would bring our grey hairs to the grave at once       If  then  you love us  if you wish for God s blessing  and your own   future happiness  we both charge you to stand upon your guard  and    if you find the least attempt made upon your virtue  be sure you leave   every thing behind you  and come away to us  for we had rather see you   all covered with rags  and even follow you to the churchyard  than   have it said  a child of ours preferred any worldly conveniences to her   virtue       We accept kindly your dutiful present  but  till we are out of pain    cannot make use of it  for fear we should partake of the price of our   poor daughter s shame  so have laid it up in a rag among the thatch    over the window  for a while  lest we should be robbed  With our   blessings  and our hearty prayers for you  we remain                   Your careful  but loving Father and Mother                                          JOHN AND ELIZABETH ANDREWS                LETTER III         DEAR FATHER       I must needs say  your letter has filled me with trouble  for it has   made my heart  which was overflowing with gratitude for my master s   goodness  suspicious and fearful  and yet I hope I shall never find him   to act unworthy of his character  for what could he get by ruining such   a poor young creature as me  But that which gives me most trouble is    that you seem to mistrust the honesty of your child  No  my dear father   and mother  be assured  that  by God s grace  I never will do any thing   that shall bring your grey hairs with sorrow to the grave  I will die a   thousand deaths  rather than be dishonest any way  Of that be assured    and set your hearts at rest  for although I have lived above myself for   some time past  yet I can be content with rags and poverty  and bread   and water  and will
