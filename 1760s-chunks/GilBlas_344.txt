but on the contrary  my good fellow  I must confess frankly  that  as far as appears at present  you are perfectly to my mind  Though the king my master had not enjoined me to take charge of your fortunes  I should have done so of my own free choice  Besides  my uncle  Don Balthasar de Zuniga  to whom I can refuse nothing  has requested me to consider you as a man for whom he particularly interests himself  that alone would be enough to fix my confidence in you  and make me most sincerely your friend   This outset of my career produced so lively an impression on my feelings  that they became unintelligibly tumultuous  I threw myself at the minister s feet  who insisted on my rising immediately  and then went on to the following effect  Return hither to day after dinner  and ask for my steward  he will acquaint you with the orders which I shall have given him  With these words his excellency broke up the conference to hear mass  according to his constant custom every day after giving audience  he then attended the king s levee       CH  IV     Gil Blas ingratiates himself with the Count of Olivarez   I DID not fail returning after dinner to the prime minister s house  and asking for his steward  whose name was Don Raymond Caporis  No sooner had I made myself known  than paying his civilities to me in the most respectful manner  Sir  said he  follow me if you please  I am to do myself the honour of shewing you the way to the apartment which is ordered for you in this family  Having spoken thus  he led me up a narrow staircase to a gallery communicating with five or six rooms  which composed the second story belonging to one wing of the house  and were furnished neatly  but without ostentation  You behold  resumed he  the lodging assigned you by his lordship  where you will always have a table of six persons  kept at his expense  You will be waited on by his own servants  and there will always be a carriage at your command  But that is not all  his excellency insisted on it in the most pointed manner  that you should be treated in every respect with the same attention as if you belonged to the house of Guzman   What the devil is the meaning of all this  said I within myself  What construction ought I to put upon all these honours  Is there not some humorous prank at the bottom of it  and must it not be more in the way of diversion than anything else  that the minister is flattering me up with so imposing an establishment  While I was ruminating in this uncertainty  fluctuating betweea hope and fear  a page came to let me know that the count was asking for me  I waited instantly on his lordship  who was quite alone in his closet  Well  Santillane  said he  are you satisfied with your rooms  and with my orders to Don Raymond  Your excellency s liberality  answered I  seems out of all proportion with its object  so that I receive it with fear and trembling  Why so  replied he  Can I be too lavish of distinction to a man whom the king has committed to my care  and for whose interests he especially commanded me to provide  No  that is impossible  and I do no more than my duty in placing you on a footing of respectability and consequence  No longer  therefore  let what I do for you he a subject of surprise  but rely on it that splendour in the eye of the world  and the solid advantages of accumulating wealth  are equally with in your grasp  if you do but attach yourself as faithfully to me as you did to the Duke of Lerma   But now that we are on the subject of that nobleman  continued he  it is said that you lived on terms of personal intimacy with him  I have a strong curiosity to lean the circumstances which led to your first acquaintance  as well as in what department you acted under him  Do not disguise or gloss over the slightest particular  for I shall not be satisfied without a full  true  and circumstantial recital  Then it was that I recollected in what an embarrassing predicament I stood with the Duke of Lerma on a similar occasion  and by what line of conduct I extricated myself  that same course I adopted once again with the happiest success  whereby the reader is to understand that throughout my narrative I softened down the passages likely to give umbrage to my patron  and glanced with a superficial delicacy over transactions which would have reflected but little lustre on my own character  I likewise manifested a considerate tenderness for the Duke of Lerma  though by giving that fallen favourite no quarter  I should better have consulted the taste of him whom I wished to please  As for Don Rodrigo de Calderona  there I laid about me with the religious fury of a bishop in a battle  I brought together  and displayed in the most glaring colours  all the anecdotes I had been able to pick up respecting his corrupt practices and underhand dealing in the sale
