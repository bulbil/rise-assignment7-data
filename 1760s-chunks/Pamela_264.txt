 Yes  sir  said   I  when Mrs  Jewkes interposed once  her ladyship said  It was hard    she  who was born in that house  could not have some privilege in   it  without being talked to by the saucy servants  And she called her   another time fat face  and womaned her most violently       Well  said my master  I am glad  my dear  you have had such an escape    My sister was always passionate  as Mrs  Peters knows  And my poor   mother had enough to do with us both  For we neither of us wanted   spirit  and when I was a boy  I never came home from school or college   for a few days  but though we longed to see one another before  yet ere   the first day was over  we had a quarrel  for she  being seven years   older than I  was always for domineering over me  and I could not bear   it  And I used  on her frequently quarrelling with the maids  and being   always at a word and a blow  to call her Captain Bab  for her name is   Barbara  And when my Lord Davers courted her  my poor mother has made up   quarrels between them three times in a day  and I used to tell her  she   would certainly beat her husband  marry whom she would  if he did not   beat her first  and break her spirit       Yet has she  continued he  very good qualities  She was a dutiful   daughter  is a good wife  she is bountiful to her servants  firm in her   friendships  charitable to the poor  and  I believe  never any sister   better loved a brother  than she me  and yet she always loved to vex and   tease me  and as I would bear a resentment longer than she  she d be one   moment the most provoking creature in the world  and the next would   do any thing to be forgiven  and I have made her  when she was the   aggressor  follow me all over the house and garden to be upon good terms   with me       But this case piques her more  because she had found out a match for   me in the family of a person of quality  and had set her heart upon   bringing it to effect  and had even proceeded far in it  without my   knowledge  and brought me into the lady s company  unknowing of her   design  But I was then averse to matrimony upon any terms  and was angry   at her proceeding in it so far without my privity or encouragement  And   she cannot  for this reason  bear the thoughts of my being now married    and to her mother s waiting maid too  as she reminds my dear Pamela    when I had declined her proposal with the daughter of a noble earl       This is the whole case  said he  and  allowing for the pride   and violence of her spirit  and that she knows not  as I do  the   transcendent excellencies of my dear Pamela  and that all her view  in   her own conception  is mine and the family honour  she is a little to be   allowed for  Though  never fear  my Pamela  but that I  who never had   a struggle with her  wherein I did not get the better  will do you   justice  and myself too       This account of Lady Davers pleased every body  and was far from being   to her ladyship s disadvantage in the main  and I would do any thing   in the world to have the honour to be in her good graces  Yet I fear it   will not be easily  if at all  effected  But I will proceed       After supper  nothing would serve Miss Darnford and Miss Boroughs  but   we must have a dance  and Mr  Peters  who plays a good fiddle  urged   it forward  My dear master  though in a riding dress  took out Miss   Boroughs       Sir Simon  for a man of his years  danced well  and took me out  but put   on one of his free jokes  that I was fitter to dance with a younger   man  and he would have it   though I had not danced since my dear lady s   death to signify  except once or twice to please Mrs  Jervis  and    indeed  believed all my dancing days over   that as my master and I were   the best dancers  we should dance once together  before folks  as the   odd gentleman said  and my dear sir was
