light of idle dreams  A sample of my skill will dispose you better than the most subtle arguments to pass a favourable judgment on my pretensions  After talking in this manner he drew from his pocket a phial full of a lively looking red liquor  on which he expatiated thus  Here is an elixir which I have distilled this morning from the juices of certain plants  for I have employed almost my whole life  like Democritus  in finding out the properties of simples and minerals  You shall make trial of its virtue  The wine we are drinking with our supper is very bad  henceforth it will become excellent  At the same time he put two drops of his elixir into my bottle  which made my wine more delicious than the choicest vintages of Spain   The marvellous strikes the imagination  and when once that faculty is enlisted  judgment is turned adrift  Delighted with so glorious a secret  and persuaded that he must have out devilled the devil before he could have got at it  I cried out in a paroxysm of admiration  O reverend father  prythee forgive your servant if he took you at first for an old blockhead  I now abjure my error  There is no need to look further to be assured that it depends only on your own will to turn an iron bar into a wedge of gold in the twinkling of an eye  How happy should I be were I master of that admirable science  Heaven preserve you from ever acquiring it  interrupted the old man with a deep sigh  You know not  my son  what a fatal possession you covet  Instead of envying  rather pity me  for having taken such infinite pains to be made unhappy  I am always disturbed in mind  I fear a discovery  and then perpetual imprisonment would be the reward of all my labours  In this apprehension  I lead a vagabond life  sometimes disguised as a priest or monk  sometimes as a gentle man or a peasant  Where is the benefit of knowing how to manufacture gold on such terms  Are not the goods of this world downright misery to those who cannot enjoy them in tranquillity   What you say appears to me very sensible  said I to the philosopher  There is nothing like living at one s ease  You have rid me of all hankering after the philosopher s stone  I will rest satisfied with learning from you my future destiny  With all my heart  my good lad  answered he  I have already made my remarks upon your features  now let me see your hand  I gave it him with a confidence which will do my penetration but little credit in the esteem of some readers  He examined it very attentively  and then pronounced  as in a rapture of inspiration  Ah  what transitions from pain to pleasure  and from pleasure to pain  What a whimsical alternation of good and evil chances  But you have already experienced the largest share of your allotted reverses  You have but few more tides of misfortune to stem  and then a great lord will contrive for you an eligible fate  which shall not be subject to change   After having assured me that I might depend on his prediction  he bade me farewell and went out of the inn  leaving me in deep meditation on the things I had just heard  There could be no doubt of the Marquis de Marialva being the great lord in question  and consequently nothing appeared more within the verge of possibility than the accomplishment of the oracle  But though there had not been the slightest likelihood  that would have been no hindrance to giving the impostor monk unbounded credit  since his elixir had transmuted my sour incredulity into the most tractable digestion of his falsehoods  That nothing might be wanting on my side to play into the hands of my foreboded luck  I determined to attach myself more closely to the marquis than I had ever done to any of my masters  Having taken this resolution  I went home in unusually high spirits  never did foolish woman descend in better humour from the garret of another foolish woman who had told her fortune       CH  X     The Marquis de Marialva gives a commission to Gil Blas  That faithful secretary acquits himself of it as shall be related   THE marquis was not yet returned from his theatrical party  and I found his upper servants playing at cards in his apartment while they were waiting for his arrival  I got to be sociable with them  and we amused ourselves with jocular conversation till two o clock in the morning  when our master arrived  He was a little surprised at seeing me  and said with an air of kindness which made me conclude that he came home very well satisfied with his evening  How is this  Gil Blas  Are you not gone to bed yet  I answered that I wished to know first whether he had any commands for me  Probably  replied he  I may have a commission to give you to morrow morning  but it will be time enough then to acquaint you with my wishes  Go to your own room  and henceforward remember that I dispense with your attendance at bed time  my other servants are sufficient for that occasion   After
