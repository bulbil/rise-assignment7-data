   While the gentlemen were thus plunged in the bottomless gulf   of the law  Mrs  Fielding beckoned Ned to a remote part of the   room  and was greatly taken with his lively and innocent chat      Pray  Mr  Fenton  said she  is this your son   No  madam  said   Mr  Fenton  we know not to whom he belongs  poor fellow   and   I am persuaded  from many circumstances  that he was stolen in   his infancy from his true parents      Mrs  Fielding instantly coloured like scarlet   and casting at her   husband an eager and animated look Gracious heaven  she ex    claimed  who knows  my dear  but this may be our precious  our   lost and long lamented boy  to whom Providence this day has so   wonderfully conducted us          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  155     Madam  said Mr  Fenton  it is thought that hundreds of children   are yearly spirited away from their parents  by gipsies  by beggars   to excite charity  and by kidnappers to carry to the plantations     but I hear of very few that ever have been restored  except in   romance  Pray  had you any particular memorandum or mark   whereby you would know him to be your child  on the presumption   of his being found       Alas   no  sir  said Mrs  Fielding   he was scarce two years old   when his nurse got leave to go and see a relation  the only visit    poor woman  that she made from the time she took my child to the   breast  She left him in the care of the housemaid  who used to   caress him with particular tenderness  He stood with her at the   door   some one called her in suddenly  but  quickly returning  my   child was gone       Ah   could the wretches who took him have guessed at the heart    rending anguish which that loss cost me  it were not in the nature   of barbarians  of brutes  of fiends themselves  to have imagined a   deed of such deadliness  For three days and three nights life   hovered like a flame that was just departing  and was only retained   by my frequent and long swoonings  that for a time shut up all   sense and recollection  Neither do I think that my dear husband   suffered much less than myself  however he might constrain and exert   his spirits to keep up  as it were  some appearance of manliness      We despatched criers throughout the city  and through all the   neighbouring towns  with offers of vast recompense to any who   should discover and restore our child to us   and we continued for   years to advertise him in all the public papers  But  alas   he must   have been taken by some very illiterate wretches who could not read    and who never heard of the rewards that were offered   their own   interest must otherwise have engaged them to return him  Pray    Mr  Fenton  how did you come by this pretty boy      Here Ned assisted Mr  Fenton to give a detail respecting him    self of the circumstances already recited   and Mr  Fenton men    tioned the precaution he had taken for seizing his former mammy   if ever she should make her appearance      If heaven should ever bless me with more children  said Mr    Fielding  I have determined to fix some indelible mark upon them    such as that of the Jerusalem letters  that in case of accident  I   may be able to discover and ascertain my own offspring from all   others  Such a precaution  said Mr  Fenton  is more especially   incumbent on those who send their children abroad to be nursed    where it is practicable for fosterers to impose a living infant in the   place of one who has died   or  by an exchange  to prefer a child of   their own to an inheritance   for the features of infancy generally   change to a degree that shortly leaves no trace of the original cast   of countenance  and it is common with parents to leave their   children at nurse for years  without seeing or renewing the memory   of their aspects      Mr  Fenton  says Mrs  Fielding  will you give me your interest in   this sweet foundling  I will regard him as my own child  I will   be good to him for the sake of the one I have lost  Tell me  my   dear  will you come and live with me   What say you  Ned
