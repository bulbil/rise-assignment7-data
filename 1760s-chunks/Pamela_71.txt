  can and will make you amends for the disturbance I have given you  As   I promised  I sent to your father the day after your departure  that he   might not be too much concerned for you  and assured him of my honour to   you  and made an excuse  such an one as ought to have satisfied him  for   your not coming to him  But this was not sufficient  it seems  for he    poor man  came to me next morning  and set my family almost in an uproar   about you        O my dear girl  what trouble has not your obstinacy given me  and   yourself too  I had no way to pacify him  but to promise that he should   see a letter written from you to Mrs  Jervis  to satisfy him you are   well        Now all my care in this case is for your aged parents  lest they should   be touched with too fatal a grief  and for you  whose duty and affection   for them I know to be so strong and laudable  for this reason I beg you   will write a few lines to them  and let me prescribe the form  which I   have done  putting myself as near as I can in your place  and expressing   your sense  with a warmth that I doubt will have too much possessed you        After what is done  and which cannot now be helped  but which  I assure   you  shall turn out honourably for you  I expect not to be refused    because I cannot possibly have any view in it  but to satisfy your   parents  which is more your concern than mine  and so I must beg you   will not alter one tittle of the underneath  If you do  it will be   impossible for me to send it  or that it should answer the good end I   propose by it        I have promised  that I will not approach you without your leave  If I   find you easy  and not attempting to dispute or avoid your present lot    I will keep to my word  although it is a difficulty upon me  Nor shall   your restraint last long  for I will assure you  that I am resolved very   soon to convince you of my good intentions  and with what ardour I am                                                            Yours  etc           The letter he prescribed for me was as this           DEAR Mrs  JERVIS        I have  instead of being driven by Robin to my dear father s  been   carried off  where I have no liberty to tell  However  at present  I   am not used hardly  and I write to beg you to let my dear father and   mother  whose hearts must be well nigh broken  know that I am well  and   that I am  and  by the grace of God  ever will be  their honest  as well   as dutiful daughter  and  Your obliged friend         I must neither send date nor place  but have most solemn assurances of   honourable usage           I knew not what to do on this most strange request and occasion  But my   heart bled so much for you  my dear father  who had taken the pains to   go yourself  and inquire after your poor daughter  as well as for my   dear mother  that I resolved to write  and pretty much in the above   form  that it might be sent to pacify you  till I could let you  somehow   or other  know the true state of the matter  And I wrote thus to my   strange wicked master himself           SIR        If you knew but the anguish of my mind  and how much I suffer by   your dreadful usage of me  you would surely pity me  and consent to my   deliverance  What have I done  that I should be the only mark of your   cruelty  I can have no hope  no desire of living left me  because I   cannot have the least dependence  after what has passed  upon your   solemn assurances   It is impossible they should be consistent with the   dishonourable methods you take        Nothing but your promise of not
