which gives me a pleasure which perhaps it ought not  there is a selfishness in it  for which I am afraid I ought to blush       You judge perfectly well  my dear  in checking the natural vivacity of your temper  however pleasing it is to all who converse with you  coquetry is dangerous to English women  because they have sensibility  it is more suited to the French  who are naturally something of the salamander kind       I have this moment a note from Bell Fermor  that she must see me this instant  I hope my Emily is well  Heaven preserve the most perfect of all its works       Adieu  my dear girl   Your affectionate  ED  RIVERS     LETTER LXIII   63   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Feb  1   WE have passed three or four droll days  my dear  Emily persists in resolving to break with Sir George  he thinks it decent to combat her resolution  lest he should lose the praise of generosity  he is also piqued to see her give him up with such perfect composure  though I am convinced he will not be sorry upon the whole to be given up  he has  from the first receipt of the letter  plainly wished her to resign him  but hoped for a few faintings and tears  as a sacrifice to his vanity on the occasion       My father is setting every engine at work to make things up again  supposing Emily to have determined from pique  not from the real feelings of her heart  he is frighted to death lest I should counterwork him  and so jealous of my advising her to continue a conduct he so much disapproves  that he won t leave us a moment together  he even observes carefully that each goes into her respective apartment when we retire to bed       This jealousy has started an idea which I think will amuse us  and which I shall take the first opportunity of communicating to Emily   tis to write each other at night our sentiments on whatever passes in the day  if she approves the plan  I will send you the letters  which will save me a great deal of trouble in telling you all our petites histoires       This scheme will have another advantage  we shall be a thousand times more sincere and open to each other by letter than face to face  I have long seen by her eyes that the little fool has twenty things to say to me  but has not courage  now letters you know  my dear    Excuse the blush  and pour out all the heart    Besides  it will be so romantic and pretty  almost as agreable as a love affair  I long to begin the correspondence         Adieu   Yours   A  FERMOR     LETTER LXIV   64   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Quebec  Feb  5   I Have but a moment  my Lucy  to tell you  my divine Emily has broke with her lover  who this morning took an eternal leave of her  and set out for Montreal in his way to New York  whence he proposes to embark for England       My sensations on this occasion are not to be described  I admire that amiable delicacy which has influenced her to give up every advantage of rank and fortune which could tempt the heart of woman  rather than unite herself to a man for whom she felt the least degree of indifference  and this  without regarding the censures of her family  or of the world  by whom  what they will call her imprudence  will never be forgiven  a woman who is capable of acting so nobly  is worthy of being beloved  of being adored  by every man who has a soul to distinguish her perfections       If I was a vain man  I might perhaps fancy her regard for me had some share in determining her conduct  but I am convinced of the contrary   tis the native delicacy of her soul alone  incapable of forming an union in which the heart has no share  which  independent of any other consideration  has been the cause of a resolution so worthy of herself       That she has the tenderest affection for me  I cannot doubt one moment  her attention is too flattering to be unobserved  but  tis that kind of affection in which the mind alone is concerned  I never gave her the most distant hint that I loved her  in her situation  it would have been even an outrage to have done so  She knows the narrowness of my circumstances  and how near impossible it is for me to marry  she therefore could not have an idea no  my dear girl   tis not to love  but to true delicacy  that she has sacrificed avarice and ambition  and she is a thousand times the more estimable from this circumstance       I am interrupted  You shall hear from me in a few days       Adieu   Your affectionate  ED  RIVERS     LETTER LXV   65   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street
