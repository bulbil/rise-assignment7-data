and children  who are five in number  I agreed to read prayers in the afternoon at another church  about four miles from hence  and for this additional duty I receive ten pounds more  As I keep a horse  it was formerly an agreeable exercise rather than a toil  but of late years I have been afflicted with a rupture  for which I consulted the most eminent operators in the kingdom  but I have no cause to rejoice in the effects of their advice  though one of them assured me I was completely cured  The malady is now more troublesome than ever  and often comes upon me so violently while I am on horseback  that I am forced to alight  and lie down upon the ground  until the cause of the disorder can for the time be reduced     Sir Launcelot not only condoled with him upon his misfortune  but desired him to throw up the second cure  and he would pay him ten pounds a year out of his own pocket   Your generosity confounds me  good sir   replied the clergyman   and yet I ought not to be surprised at any instance of benevolence in Sir Launcelot Greaves  but I will check the fulness of my heart  I shall only observe  that your good intention towards me can hardly take effect  The gentleman  who is to succeed the late incumbent  has given me notice to quit the premises  as he hath provided a friend of his own for the curacy    What   cried the knight   does he mean to take your bread from you  without assigning any other reason    Surely  sir   replied the ecclesiastic   I know of no other reason  I hope my morals are irreproachable  and that I have done my duty with a conscientious regard  I may venture an appeal to the parishioners among whom I have lived these seventeen years  After all  it is natural for every man to favour his own friends in preference to strangers  As for me  I propose to try my fortune in the great city  and I doubt not but Providence will provide for me and my little ones     To this declaration Sir Launcelot made no reply  but  riding home  set on foot a strict inquiry into the character of this man  whose name was Jenkins  He found that he was a reputed scholar  equally remarkable for his modesty and good life  that he visited the sick  assisted the needy  compromised disputes among his neighbours  and spent his time in such a manner as would have done honour to any Christian divine  Thus informed  the knight sent for the gentleman to whom the living had been promised  and accosted him to this effect   Mr  Tootle  I have a favour to ask of you  The person who serves the cure of this parish is a man of good character  beloved by the people  and has a large family  I shall be obliged to you if you will continue him in the curacy   The other told him he was sorry he could not comply with his request  being that he had already promised the curacy to a friend of his own   No matter   replied Sir Launcelot   since I have not interest with you  I will endeavour to provide for Mr  Jenkins in some other way     That same afternoon he walked over to the curate s house  and told him that he had spoken in his behalf to Dr  Tootle  but the curacy was pre engaged  The good man having made a thousand acknowledgments for the trouble his honour had taken   I have not interest sufficient to make you curate   said the knight   but I can give you the living itself  and that you shall have   So saying  he retired  leaving Mr  Jenkins incapable of uttering one syllable  so powerfully was he struck with this unexpected turn of good fortune  The presentation was immediately made out  and in a few days Mr  Jenkins was put in possession of his benefice  to the inexpressible joy of the congregation    Hitherto everything went right  and every unprejudiced person commended the knight s conduct  but in a little time his generosity seemed to overleap the bounds of discretion  and even in some cases might be thought tending to a breach of the king s peace  For example  he compelled  vi et armis  a rich farmer s son to marry the daughter of a cottager  whom the young fellow had debauched  Indeed  it seems there was a promise of marriage in the case  though it could not be legally ascertained  The wench took on dismally  and her parents had recourse to Sir Launcelot  who  sending for the delinquent  expostulated with him severely on the injury he had done the young woman  and exhorted him to save her life and reputation by performing his promise  in which case he  Sir Launcelot  would give her three hundred pounds to her portion  Whether the farmer thought there was something interested in this uncommon offer  or was a little elevated by the consciousness of his father s wealth  he rejected the proposal with rustic disdain  and said  if so
