most solemn and fervent manner  to obey all her injunctions  as the last dictates of a parent whom he should never cease to honour  Then she favoured them both with a great deal of salutary advice touching their conduct before and after marriage  and presented him with a ring as a memorial of her affection  at the same time he pulled another off his finger  and made a tender of it as a pledge of his love to Aurelia  whom her mother permitted to receive this token  Finally  he took a last farewell of the good matron  and returned to his father with the particulars of this interview    In two days Mrs  Darnel departed this life  and Aurelia was removed to the house of a relation  where her grief had like to have proved fatal to her constitution    In the meantime  the mother was no sooner committed to the earth  than Mr  Greaves  mindful of her exhortations  began to take measures for a reconciliation with the guardian  He engaged several gentlemen to interpose their good offices  but they always met with the most mortifying repulse  and at last Anthony Darnel declared that his hatred to the house of Greaves was hereditary  habitual  and unconquerable  He swore he would spend his heart s blood to perpetuate the quarrel  and that  sooner than his niece should match with young Launcelot  he would sacrifice her with his own hand    The young gentleman  finding his prejudice so rancorous and invincible  left off making any further advances  and  since he found it impossible to obtain his consent  resolved to cultivate the good graces of Aurelia  and wed her in despite of her implacable guardian  He found means to establish a literary correspondence with her as soon as her grief was a little abated  and even to effect an interview  after her return to her own house  but he soon had reason to repent of his indulgence  The uncle entertained spies upon the young lady  who gave him an account of this meeting  in consequence of which she was suddenly hurried to some distant part of the country  which we never could discover    It was then we thought Mr  Launcelot a little disordered in his brain  his grief was so wild  and his passion so impetuous  He refused all sustenance  neglected his person  renounced his amusements  rode out in the rain  sometimes bareheaded  strolled about the fields all night  and became so peevish  that none of the domestics durst speak to him without the hazard of broken bones  Having played these pranks for about three weeks  to the unspeakable chagrin of his father  and the astonishment of all that knew him  he suddenly grew calm  and his good humour returned  But this  as your seafaring people say  was a deceitful calm  that soon ushered in a dreadful storm    He had long sought an opportunity to tamper with some of Mr  Darnel s servants  who could inform him of the place where Aurelia was confined  but there was not one about the family who could give him that satisfaction  for the persons who accompanied her remained as a watch upon her motions  and none of the other domestics were privy to the transaction  All attempts proving fruitless  he could no longer restrain his impatience  but throwing himself in the way of the uncle  upbraided him in such harsh terms  that a formal challenge ensued  They agreed to decide their difference without witnesses  and one morning  before sunrise  met on that very common where Mr  Greaves had saved the life of Aurelia  The first pistol was fired on each side without any effect  but Mr  Darnel s second wounded the young squire in the flank  nevertheless  having a pistol in reserve  he desired his antagonist to ask his life  The other  instead of submitting  drew his sword  and Mr  Greaves  firing his piece into the air  followed his example  The contest then became very hot  though of short continuance  Darnel being disarmed at the first onset  our young squire gave him back the sword  which he was base enough to use a second time against his conqueror  Such an instance of repeated ingratitude and brutal ferocity divested Mr  Greaves of his temper and forbearance  He attacked Mr  Anthony with great fury  and at the first lunge ran him up to the hilt  at the same time seized with his left hand the shell of his enemy s sword  which he broke in disdain  Mr  Darnel having fallen  the other immediately mounted his horse  which he had tied to a tree before the engagement  and  riding full speed to Ashenton  sent a surgeon to Anthony s assistance  He afterwards ingenuously confessed all these particulars to his father  who was overwhelmed with consternation  for the wounds of Darnel were judged mortal  and  as no person had seen the particulars of the duel  Mr  Launcelot might have been convicted of murder    On these considerations  before a warrant could be served upon him  the old knight  by dint of the most eager entreaties  accompanied with marks of horror and despair  prevailed upon his son to withdraw himself from the kingdom until such time as
