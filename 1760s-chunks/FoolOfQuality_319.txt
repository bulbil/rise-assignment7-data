and I fell to the care of my only kinsman   an uncle by my father s side      My uncle was an old bachelor  and though he was of a cold   temper  and had no tenderness for any one  he yet spared no cost   in my education  He sent me to Eton school  and from thence   to Cambridge  where I remained till I took my degrees  I then   went to London  bought a sword and sword knot  and commenced   fine gentleman      Though my head had been duly stored by my tutors in the   rudiments of our religion  my heart had not yet felt any of its   precepts  and I conceived that to go regularly to church  receive   the sacrament  confess myself a miserable sinner  and avoid gross   vices  was the sum of Christianity  I therefore entered without   scruple into all the fashionable pleasures and vanities of the age     and I held that to pardon an affront would have been one of the   deadly sins in a gentleman Christian      One day  at St  James s coffee house  Colonel Standard and   another gentleman engaged at backgammon for five hundred   guineas   and the stake was so considerable  and both parties   celebrated for their skill in the game  we all crowded about them   to see the issue      I happened to be next behind the colonel s chair  and others   pressed behind me  eagerly bending and looking over my shoulders    At length he began to fret as the game was drawing to a close    and going against him  Pray  gentlemen  he would cry  don t   bear upon me so   for heaven s sake keep off you will make me   lose the game   Hereupon I did my utmost to bear back from   him  but the company pressed me forward in spite of all I could   do   till the colonel  giving an unhappily decisive cast  turned about   in fury  and spat directly in my face      Indignation gave me sudden and unusual strength  and  casting   all off who had borne upon me  I instantly drew my sword  and   ran the colonel through the body  The company cried out that all   was fair  and  opening a window for me  they urged me to escape    Accordingly I got off  rode post to Dover  and there embarked   for France      The colonel  God be praised   did not die of his wound  He lay   under the hands of the surgeons for above seven months  then   recovered  and went to join his regiment in Flanders      Of this my uncle sent me advice  telling me at the same time         350 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      that I might return with safety  Yes  thought I  with safety to my   life  but with death to my honour   I have taken revenge  indeed    but not satisfaction  the colonel must be compelled to make me   personal reparation for the affront which he dared to put upon me    His recovery has again dashed the spittle into my face   and I will   pursue him through the world till it is wiped from the observation   and remembrance of all men      With this deadly determination I went post from Paris to   Flanders  and traced the colonel from place to place  till I found   him in a village on the road to Amsterdam      I believe  sir  said I bluntly  you may not remember me  for our   acquaintance was sudden  and of very short duration  I am the   man in whose face you spit publicly at St  James s coffee house    Then  sir  said he  I am scarce yet recovered of the cause which   you gave me to bear you always in mind   but pray  what may your   commands be with me for the present   I am come to demand a   remedy at your hands for the wound which you gave my honour    and which otherwise must remain for ever incurable  Ah   he   cried  no man ever exacted so severe a satisfaction as you have   already taken   what  then  may be the nature of the further repa    ration that you are pleased to require   Either to ask my pardon    or fight me within this hour      This is very hard upon me  indeed  replied the colonel  the   honour of my commission will not allow me to beg pardon of any   man  at least in order to avoid a combat   so  sir  if you insist upon
