how preposterous it would be to think of revenging the quarrel of a sister  who  notwithstanding my behaviour  would  I dare say  be much better pleased at his fall than mine  I have been more than once challenged by the brothers of young ladies  Charles  and I always found the dear girls thought the fellows extremely impertinent who presumed to call me to an account  There are few sisters  Melmoth  like lady Haversham  on the contrary  most women would much sooner wish to see a brother stretched dead upon the field of combat  than to hear that an infamous rascal  who had destroyed both their peace and their reputation  had met with the smallest accident  For my   161 own part  dearly as I love lady Haversham  was it possible for her to be ruined and deserted  I should never think of calling the villain to an account—After the last intimacy  a woman always espouses the cause of her lover  and a brother has of course little occasion to interfere  when  at the very moment he is hazarding his life in the cause of a sister  she is secretly praying for the success of his antagonist  Colonel Mildmay knows the world  and will never dream of exposing his life in a quarrel where there is no probability even of meeting with thanks  Be easy therefore  dear Charles  on this head  and believe me to be your s unalterably   ROBERT HAROLD     162  LETTER XII  Sir ROBERT HAROLD to CHARLES MELMOTH  Esq    BRISTOL   Dear CHARLES   YOU will undoubtedly be surprized   after reading the firm resolution which I made in my last  of going instantly to London  and accommodating the unhappy affair with Miss Mildmay   to hear that  instead of following that resolution  I am this moment preparing to quit the kingdom  and shall  in all probability  never more see Louisa s face  nor set a foot in England  O  Charles  to what a fate am I reserved  one misfortune treads fast upon the heels of another  and the worthy  though misguided  colonel Mildmay  is perhaps  by   163 this time  dead through a rash indignation at the fate of his sister   I was just stepping into my chaise at the Crown in Reading  when a gentleman in a post chariot and six  who was driving at a furious rate  accidentally seeing me  ordered his people to stop  and coming out of the carriage slapped me familiary upon the shoulder  and expressed no little astonishment at seeing me in Reading  saying  he thought I had been considerably better employed than in driving round the country  The meeting was an unluckily one  Charles  for the gentleman was no other than colonel Mildmay  he was going down to his father s to be present at my marriage with Louisa  and now desired me to step into his carriage  as it would be much more agreeable to ride together than to travel in separate vehicles     164You may be sure  that  if the unexpected appearance of the colonel disconcerted me at first  my confusion was no way abated by the proposal of accompanying him to his father s  I was excessively aukward  and made some stammering sort of a reply  which I fancy rendered me cursedly contemptible  The colonel perceiving me so much embarrassed  demanded  with a faltering tone  and a look of the utmost apprehension  if all was right  and if I still continued on a proper footing with Louisa  This question was a home one  Melmoth  and to evade it would have been the lowest degree of timidity  I therefore hinted  that a little acccident had intervened  which must necessarily occasion a short procrastination of our nuptials  but that I had no doubt of every thing s being settled to the mutual satisfaction of both families     165This reply threw the colonel into the greatest consternation  his brows were in an instant stretched a full inch above their natural situation  his eyes were fixed into a stare of unutterable astonishment  his mouth insensibly widened to a horror of distention  and his complexion  which the moment before was remarkably glowing  now assumed a white of the most deadly kind imaginable  at last  with an accent scarce audible  while a tear imperceptibly stole down his cheek  he desired me to step into the inn with him  and insinuated that he expected to be made acquainted with the particulars  I accordingly ascented to his proposal  and a private room being ordered  we went up stairs together  and for some moments sat in a state of silent anxiety  each expecting that the other would open first  while each nevertheless dreaded to enter upon a conversation     166The colonel  however  finding that I was no way likely to begin the discourse  and naturally recollecting that  as he had been the proposer of the intended explanation  it became him to break silence  he exclaimed with an interrogatory repetition    And so  Sir Robert  an affair has happened  which must inevitably delay your marriage with Louisa   —  Yes  colonel  and I sincerely lament the occasion of that delay  as I flattered myself with a hope of being the
