plump  rich  civil  cit  whose house we must of necessity pass  As my Lord despises wealth  and Mr  Westbrook s genealogy in the third generation loses itself in a livery stable  he has always avoided an intimacy  which the other has as studiously fought  but  as it is not in his nature to treat any body with ill breeding  he has suffered their visits  though he has been slow in returning them  and has sometimes invited the daughter to a ball      The lady wife  who is a woman of great erudition  and is at present intirely lost to the world  all her faculties being on the rack composing a treatise against the immortality of the soul  sent down an apology  and we were entertained by Mademoiselle la Fille  who is little  lean  brown           1 44       with small pert black eyes  quickened by a large quantity of abominable bad rouge  she talks incessantly  has a great deal of city vivacity  and a prodigious passion for people of a certain rank  a phrase of which she is peculiarly fond  Her mother being above the little vulgar cares of a family  or so unimportant a task as the education of an only child  she was early entrusted to a French chamber maid  who  having left her own country on account of a Faux Pas which had visible consequences  was appointed to instill the principles of virtue and politeness into the flexible mind of this illustrious heiress of the house of Westbrook  under the title of governess  My information of this morning further says  that  by the cares of this accomplished person  she acquired a competent  though incorrect  knowledge of the French language  with cunning  dissimulation  assurance  and a taste for gallantry  to which if you add a servile passion for quality  and an oppressive insolence        1 45       to all  however worthy  who want that wealth which she owes to her father s skill in Change Alley  you will have an idea of the bride I intend for Harry Mandeville  Methinks I hear you exclaim   Heavens  what a conjunction    Tis might well  but people must live  and there is 80 000l  attached to this animal  and  if the girl likes him  I don t see what he can do better  with birth  and a habit of profuse expence  which he has so little to support  She sung  for the creature sings  a tender Italian air  which she addressed to Harry in a manner and with a look  that convinces me her stile is l amorose  and that Harry is the present object  After the song  I surprised him talking low to her  and pressing her hand  whilst we were all admiring an India cabinet  and  on seeing he was observed  he left her with an air of conscious guilt  which convinces me he intends to follow the pursuit  and is at the same time ashamed of his purpose  Poor fellow  I pity him  but marriage is his        1 46       only card  I ll put the matter forward  and make my lord invite her to the next ball  Don t you think I am a generous creature  to sacrifise the man I love to his own good  When shall I see one of your selfish sex so disinterested  No  you men have absolutely no idea of sentiment   Adio  A  Wilmot      To George Mordaunt  Esq      IT is the custom here for every body to spend their mornings as they please  which does not however hinder our sometimes making parties all together  when our inclinations happen all to take the same turn  My Lord this morning proposed an airing to the Ladies  and that we should  instead of returning to dinner  stop at the first neat farm house where we could hope for decent accommodations  Love of variety made the proposal agreeable to us all  and a servant being ordered          1 47       before to make some little provision  we stopped  after the pleasantest airing imaginable  at the entrance of a wood  where  leaving our equipages to be sent to the neighbouring village  we walked up a winding path to a rustic building  embosomed in the grove  the architecture of which was in the most elegant stile of simplicity  the trees round this lovely retreat were covered with wood bines and jessamines  from which a gale of perfume met our approach  the gentlest breath of Zephyr just moved the leaves  the birds sung in the branches  a spring of the clearest water broke from the rising ground on the left  and  murmuring along a transparent pebbly bottom  seemed to lose itself in a thicket of roses  no rude sound disturbed the sweet harmony of nature  all breathed the soul of innocence and tranquillity  but a tranquillity raised above itself  My heart danced with pleasure  and  the lovely lady Julia happening to
