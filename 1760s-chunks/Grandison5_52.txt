me  I hope not   I will not pity Lady Olivia  because she threatned and raved  True Love rages not  threatens not  Yet a disappointment in Love is a dreadful thing  and may operate  in different minds  different ways  as I have read somewhere   I shall write to all my friends in town  and at Colnebrooke  I trouble you not  therefore  with particular compliments to them   How could you mention the names of Mr  and Mrs  Reeves  and say no more of them  I thought you loved them both  They are deserving of your love  and love you   Never  I believe  did any young creature suffer in her mind by suspense as I have done for some months past  In the present situation of things I know not what further to write  What can I  my Charlotte —Conjectural topics are reserved for my closet and pillow   Adieu  and adieu  my beloved friend  my dear Lady G  Be good  and he happy  What a blessing  that both are in your power  May they ever be Page  130 so  And may you make a good use of that power  prays  Your HARRIET BYRON   LETTER XXIII  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  To Dr  BARTLETT    Bologna  June 8 19   MY heart is unusually sad  How imperfect is that happiness which we cannot enjoy without giving pain to another  The Count of Belvedere has been made acquainted with the hopeful turn in the mind of Clementina  and that  in all probability  she will be given as a reward to the man to whose friendly cares for her  and her brother  the whole family attribute the happy alteration  and late last night he gave me notice of his arrival in this city  and of his intention to pay me an early visit this morning   I have just now had a message from Clementina by Camilla  with a request  that I will suspend my intended visit till the afternoon   I asked Camilla  If she knew the reason of this  and of her being so early dispatched with it  She said  It was her young Lady s own order  without consulting any body  The Marchioness  said she  yesterday in the afternoon  told her that every thing was now absolutely determined upon between them and me and she would be mistress of her own wishes  and that I should be allowed to attend her in the morning at breakfast  to know what those were  Her young Lady  on this happy communication  so Camilla called it  threw herself at her mother s feet  and in a very graceful manner acknowleged her father s and her indulgence to her  and from that hour her temper took a turn different from what it had been before  For  ever since  said Camilla  she has been silent  solemn  and reserved  yet busy at her pen  transcribing Page  131 fair from her pocket book what she had written in it  To morrow  Camilla —To morrow  said she breaking once her solemn silence  her complexion varying  will be a day indeed  O that it were come  and yet I dread it  How shall I  face to face  converse with this exalted man  What shall I do to appear as great as He  His goodness fires me with emulation —O that to morrow were come  and gone   This was over night  I believe  proceeded Camilla  that the dear Lady is drawing up some conditions of her own for you to sign  But Sir  I dare say  by the hint she has thrown out  they will be generous ones  and what will have more of fancy than hardship in them   I had much ado to prevail upon her  continued her faithful woman  to go to rest at midnight  Yet at four in the morning she arose  and went to her pen and ink  and about Six commanded me to call Laura to attend her  while I went to you with the message I have brought  I expostulated with her  and begged she would delay it till the Marchioness arose  but she began to be impatient  I have reason in my request  Camilla  said she  I must not be contradicted  or expostulated with  My head will not bear opposition  at this time  Is it a slight thing for such a poor creature as I have been  and am  to be put out of her course  Am I not to have a meeting with the Chevalier Grandison  on the most important act of my life  My mamma tells me  that I am to be now mistress of my own will  Don t you  Camilla  seek to controul me  I shall not be prepared enough for the subject he will possibly talk to me upon  till the afternoon  And if I know he is in the house with an expectation of seeing me  I shall want the presence of mind I am struggling to obtain   So  Sir  concluded Camilla  I have performed my duty  The dear Lady  I see  will be in too much confusion  if the important subject be not begun with Page
