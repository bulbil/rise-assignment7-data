by degrees  he recovered his  serenity  Having perused the letter  his eyes sparkling with joy and  gratitude  he hugged the lieutenant in his arms  and presented him to  the ladies as one of his best friends  Jack met with a most gracious  reception  and shook Emilia by the hand  telling her  with the familiar  appellation of  old acquaintance  that he did not care how soon he was  master of such another clean going frigate as herself  The whole company  partook of this favourable change that evidently appeared in our lover s  recollection  and enlivened his conversation with such an uncommon flow  of sprightliness and good humour  as even made an impression on the iron  countenance of Pipes himself  who actually smiled with satisfaction as  he walked behind them   The evening being pretty far advanced  they directed their course  homeward  and while the valet attended Hatchway to the inn  Peregrine  escorted the ladies to their lodgings  where he owned the justness of  Sophy s remark in saying he was out of humour  and told them he had been  extremely chagrined at a difference which had happened between him and  his uncle  to whom  by the letter which they had seen him receive  he  now found himself happily reconciled   Having received their congratulations  and declined staying to sup  with them  on account of the longing desire he had to converse with his  friend Jack  he took his leave  and repaired to the inn  where Hatchway  informed him of everything that had happened in the garrison upon his  presentations  Far from being disgusted  he was perfectly well pleased  with the prospect of going abroad  which flattered his vanity and  ambition  gratified his thirst after knowledge  and indulged that turn  for observation  for which he had been remarkable from his most  tender years  Neither did he believe a short absence would tend to the  prejudice of his love  but  on the contrary  enhance the value of his  heart  because he should return better accomplished  consequently  a  more welcome offering to his mistress  Elevated with these sentiments   his heart dilated with joy  and the sluices of his natural benevolence  being opened by this happy turn of his affairs  he sent his compliment  to Mr  Jolter  to whom he had not spoken during a whole week  and  desired he would favour Mr  Hatchway and him with his company at supper   The governor was not weak enough to decline this invitation  in  consequence of which he forthwith appeared  and was cordially  welcomed by the relenting pupil  who expressed his sorrow for the  misunderstanding which had prevailed between them  and assured him that  for the future he would avoid giving him any just cause of complaint   Jolter  who did not want affections  was melted by this acknowledgment   which he could not have expected  and earnestly protested  that his  chief study had always been  and ever should be  to promote Mr  Pickle s  interest and happiness     6 22 15  3 45 PM   The best part of the night being spent in the circulation of a cheerful  glass  the company broke up  and next morning Peregrine went out with  a view of making his mistress acquainted with his uncle s intention  of sending him out of the kingdom for his improvement  and of saying  everything which he thought necessary for the interest of his love  He  found her at breakfast with her cousin  and  as he was very full of  the subject of his visit  had scarce fixed himself in his seat  when he  brought it upon the carpet  by asking  with a smile  if the ladies had  any commands for Paris  Emilia at this question began to stare  and her  confidant desired to know who was going thither  He no sooner gave  to understand that he himself intended in a short time to visit that  capital  than his mistress with great precipitation wished him a good  journey  and affected to talk with indifference the pleasures he would  enjoy in France  but when he seriously assured Sophy  who asked if he  was in earnest  and his uncle actually insisted upon his making a short  tour  the tears gushed in poor Emilia s eyes  and she was at great pains  to conceal her concern  by observing that the tea was so scalding hot   as to make her eyes water  This pretext was too thin to impose upon her  lover  or even deceive the observation of her friend Sophy  who  after  breakfast  took an opportunity of quitting the room   Thus left by themselves  Peregrine imparted to her what he had learnt  of the commodore s intention  without  however  mentioning a syllable  of his being offended at their correspondence  and accompanied his  information with such fervent vows of eternal constancy and solemn  promises of a speedy return  that Emily s heart  which had been invaded  by a suspicion that this scheme of travelling was an effect of her  lover s inconstancy  began to be more
