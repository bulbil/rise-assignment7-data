preserve the influence over him which friendship first gave me        That influence  and her extreme attention to study his taste in every thing  with those uncommon graces both of mind and person she has received from nature  will  I hope  effectually fix this wandering star       She tells me  she has asked you to a masquerade at Temple house  to which you will extremely oblige us all by coming       You do not tell us  whether the affair of your majority is settled  if obliged to return immediately  Temple will send you back       Adieu  Your faithful  ED  RIVERS       I have this moment your last letter  you are right  we American travellers are under great disadvantages  our imaginations are restrained  we have not the pomp of the orient to describe  but the simple and unadorned charms of nature     LETTER CCXII   212   To Colonel RIVERS  Bellfield  Rutland   Nov  4   SIR William Verville is come back to town  I was with him this morning  he desires to see the child  he tells me  his brother  in his last moments  mentioned this story in all the agony of remorse  and begged him to provide for the little innocent  if to be found  that he had made many enquiries  but hitherto in vain  and that he thought himself happy in the discovery       He talks of settling three thousand pounds on the child  and taking the care of educating him into his own hands       I hinted at some little provision for the amiable girl who had saved him from perishing  and had the pleasure to find Sir William listen to me with attention       I am sorry it is not possible for me to be at your masquerade  but my affair is just at the crisis  Bell expects a particular account of it from Mrs  Rivers  and desires to be immediately in the secret of the ladies dresses  though you are not  she begs you will send your fair cottager and little charge to us  and we will take care to introduce them properly to Sir William       I am too much hurried to say more       Adieu  my dear Rivers   Your affectionate  J  FITZGERALD     LETTER CCXIII   213   To Mrs  FITZGERALD   Nov  8   YES  my dear Bell  politeness is undoubtedly a moral virtue       As we are beings formed for  and not capable of being happy without  society  it is the duty of every one to endeavor to make it as easy and agreable as they can  which is only to be done by such an attention to others as is consistent with what we owe to ourselves  all we give them in civility will be re paid us in respect  insolence and ill breeding are detestable to all mankind       I long to see you  my dear Bell  the delight I have had in your society has spoiled my relish for that of meer acquaintance  however agreable        Tis dangerous to indulge in the pleasures of friendship  they weaken one s taste too much for common conversation       Yet what other pleasures are worth the name  what others have spirit and delicacy too       I am preparing for the masquerade  which is to be the 18th  I am extremely disappointed you will not be with us       My dress is simple and unornamented  but I think becoming and prettily fancied  it is that of a French paisanne  Lucy is to be a sultana  blazing with diamonds  my mother a Roman matron       I chuse this dress because I have heard my dear Rivers admire it  to be one moment more pleasing in his eyes  is an object worthy all my attention       Adieu   Your faithful  EMILY RIVERS     LETTER CCXIV   214   To Mrs  RIVERS  Bellfield  Rutland   London  Nov  10   CERTAINLY  my dear  friendship is a mighty pretty invention  and  next to love  gives of all things the greatest spirit to society       And yet the prudery of the age will hardly allow us poor women even this pleasure  innocent as it is       I remember my aunt Cecily  who died at sixty six  without ever having felt the least spark of affection for any human being  used to tell me  a prudent modest woman never loved any thing but herself       For my part  I think all the kind propensities of the heart ought rather to be cherished than checked  that one is allowed to esteem merit even in the naughty creature  man        I love you very sincerely  Emily  but I like friendships for the men best  and think prudery  by forbidding them  robs us of some of the most lively as well as innocent pleasures of the heart       That desire of pleasing  which one feels much the most strongly for a male friend  is in itself a very agreable emotion       You will say  I am a coquet even in friendship
