for a considerable time past avowed to him  Never to be his  and to be a single woman all my life  if he would not disengage me of my rash  my foolish promise  And now be pleased  looking round her to every one present  to advise me what to do   Lord  L  I think the man utterly unworthy of you  sister Charlotte  I think you are right to resolve never to have him   Lady L  Without waiting for my brother s opinion  I must say  That he acts most ungenerously and unworthily  to hold you to an unequal promise  A promise    277 the like of which you offered not to bind him by  I cannot  Charlotte  think you bound by such a promise  And the poor trick of getting another person to write his letters for him  and exposing my sister to a stranger  and against stipulation—How I should hate him —What say you  sister Harriet   Harriet  I should be unworthy of this kind confidence  if  thus called upon  I did not say something  tho  it came out to be next to nothing—There seems not to have been any strong affection  any sympathy of soul  if I may so express myself  at any time  Miss Grandison  between you and Captain Anderson  I think   Sir Ch  A very proper question   Miss Gr  There was not  on either side  I believe  I have hinted at my motives  and at his  In every letter of his he gave me cause to confirm what I have said of his self interestedness  And now his principal plea to hold me to my promise  is  his interest  I would not to him  I never did  plead mine  tho  his example would excuse me  if I did   Lord L  Was the promise given in writing  sister   Miss Gr  Indeed it was  She looked down   Harriet  May I be pardon d  madam —The substance of your promise was  That you would never marry any other man without his consent  while he remained unmarried—Did you promise  that if ever you did marry at all  it should be to him   Miss Gr  No  He wanted me to promise that  but I refused  And now  my Harriet  what is your advice   Harriet  I beg to hear Dr  Bartlett s opinion  and yours  Sir  to Sir Charles  before I presume to give mine   Sir Charles looked at the Doctor  The Doctor referred himself to him   Sir Ch  Then  Doctor  you must set me right  if I am wrong  You are a Casuist     278 As to what Lord L  has said  I think with his Lordship  that Captain Anderson appears not  in any of his conduct  to be worthy of Miss Grandison  And in truth  I don t know many who are  If I am partial excuse the brother   She bowed  Every one was pleased  that Miss Grandison was enabled to hold up her head  as she did  on this compliment from her brother   Sir Ch  I think also  if my sister esteems him not  she is in the right to resolve never to be his  But what shall we say  as to her promise  Never to be the wife of any other man without his consent▪ while he remains unmarried  It was made  I apprehend  while her father was living  who might  I believe  Doctor  you will allow  have absolved her from it  But then  her very treating with him since to dispense with it  shews  that in her own conscience she thinks herself bound by it   Every one being silent  he proceeded   Lady L  is of opinion  that he acts ungenerously and unworthily  to endeavour to hold her to an unequal promise  But what man  except a very generous one indeed  having obtained an advantage over such a woman as Charlotte  She redden d  would not try to hold it  Must he not  by giving up this advantage  vote against himself  Women should be sure of the men in whom they place a confidence that concerns them highly  Can you think  that the man who engages a woman to make a promise  does not intend to hold her to it  When he teazes her to make it  he as good as tells her he does  let what will happen to make her wish she had not   Miss Gr  O my brother  The repetition of that word teazes —Are you not raillying me —Indeed I deserve it   Sir Ch  Men gain all their advantages by teazing  by promises  by importunities—Be not concerned  my Charlotte  that I use your word     279Miss Gr  O my brother  what shall I do  if you railly me on my folly   Sir Ch  I mean not to railly you  But I know something of my own sex  and must have been very negligent of my opportunities  if I know not something of the world  I thought  Lucy
