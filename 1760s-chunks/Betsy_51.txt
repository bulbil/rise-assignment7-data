but  as she   said  indeed  there was no probability of my doing so  and therefore I   attempted  through her persuasions  to make a virtue of necessity  and   forget both him and all that passed between us  I should in the end    perhaps  have accomplished this point  but  oh  I had a remembrancer   within  which I did not presently know of  In fine  I had but too much   reason to believe I was pregnant  a thing which  though a natural   consequence of the folly I had been guilty of  never once entered my   head        Mademoiselle Grenouille seemed now terribly alarmed  on my   communicating to her my suspicions on this score  she cried  twas very   unlucky   then paused  and asked what I would do  if it should really be   as I feared  I replied  that I knew not what course to take  for if my   father should know it I was utterly undone  I added  that he was a very   austere man  and  besides  I had a mother in law  who would not fail to   say every thing she could to incense him against me         I see no recourse you have  then   said she   but by taking physick to   cause an abortion  You must pretend you are a little disordered  and   send for an apothecary  the sooner the better  for if it should become   visible  all would infallibly be known  and we should both be ruined         I was not so weak as not to see  that if any discovery were made  her   share in the intrigue must come out  and she would be directly turned   out of doors  and that  whatever concern she pretended for me  it was   chiefly on her own account  however  as I saw no other remedy  was   resolved to take her advice        Thus  by having been guilty of one crime  I was ensnared to commit   another of a yet fouler kind  one was the error of nature  this an   offence against nature  The black design  however  succeeded not  I took   potion after potion  yet still retained the token of my shame  which at   length became too perspicuous for me to hope it would not be taken   notice of by all who saw me        I was almost distracted  and Mademoiselle Grenouille little less so  I   was one day alone in my chamber  pondering on my wretched state  and   venting some part of the anguish of my mind in tears  when she came in     What avails all this whimpering   said she   you do but hasten what you   would wish to avoid  The governess already perceives you are strangely   altered  she thinks you are either in a bad state of health  or some way   disordered in your mind  and talks of writing to your father to send for   you home    Oh Heaven   cried I   Home  did you say   No  I will never   go home  The grave is not so hateful to me  nor death so terrible  as my   father s presence     I pity you from my soul   said she   but what can   you do  There will be no staying for you here  after your condition is   once known  and it cannot be concealed much longer   These words  the   truth of which I was very well convinced of  drove me into the last   despair  I raved  I tore my hair  I swore to poison  drown  or stab   myself  rather than live to have my shame exposed to the severity of my   father  and reproaches of my kindred          Come  come   resumed she   there is no need of such desperate remedies    you had better go to London  and have recourse to Wildly  who knows  as   you are a gentleman s daughter  and will have a fortune  but you may   persuade him to marry you  If not  you can oblige him to take care of   you in your lying in  and to keep the child  and when you are once got   rid of your burden  some excuse or other may be found for your   elopement          But how shall I get to London   resumed I   how find out my undoer in a   place I know nothing of  nor ever have been at  Of whom shall I enquire    I am ignorant of what family he is  or even where he lives
