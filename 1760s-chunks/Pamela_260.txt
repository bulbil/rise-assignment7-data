 given you for a partner  and I shall never find fault with you  do what   you will       Mr  Perry said  You are very good to me  sir  and Miss Boroughs  I   observed  seemed pleased with the compliment to her humble servant  by   which I saw she esteemed him  as he appears to deserve  Dear sir  said   I  how much better is this  than to be locked in by Lady Davers       The supper was brought in sooner on my account  because I had had no   dinner  and there passed very agreeable compliments on the occasion    Lady Darnford would help me first  because I had so long fasted  as she   said  Sir Simon would have placed himself next me  And my master said    He thought it was best  where there was an equal number of ladies and   gentlemen  that they should sit  intermingled  that the gentlemen might   be employed in helping and serving the ladies  Lady Darnford said    She hoped Sir Simon would not sit above any ladies at his own table   especially  Well  said he  I shall sit over against her  however  and   that s as well       My dearest sir could not keep his eyes off me  and seemed generously   delighted with all I did  and all I said  and every one was pleased to   see his kind and affectionate behaviour to me       Lady Jones brought up the discourse about Lady Davers again  and my   master said  I fear  Pamela  you have been hardly used  more than you ll   say  I know my sister s passionate temper too well  to believe she could   be over civil to you  especially as it happened so unluckily that I was   out  If  added he  she had no pique to you  my dear  yet what has passed   between her and me  has so exasperated her  that I know she would have   quarrelled with my horse  if she had thought I valued it  and nobody   else was in her way  Dear sir  said I  don t say so of good Lady Davers       Why  my dear  said he  I know she came on purpose to quarrel  and had   she not found herself under a very violent uneasiness  after what had   passed between us  and my treatment of her lord s letter  she would   not have offered to come near me  What sort of language had she for me    Pamela  O sir  very good  only her well mannered brother  and such as   that       Only  said he   tis taking up the attention of the company disagreeably    or I could tell you almost every word she said  Lady Jones wished to   hear a further account of my lady s conduct  and most of the company   joined with her  particularly Mrs  Peters  who said  that as they knew   the story  and Lady Davers s temper  though she was very good in the   main  they could wish to be so agreeably entertained  if he and I   pleased  because they imagined I should have no difficulties after this       Tell me  then  Pamela  said he  did she lift up her hand at you  Did   she strike you  But I hope not  A little slap of the hand  said I  or   so   Insolent woman  She did not  I hope  offer to strike your face    Why  said I  I was a little saucy once or twice  and she would have   given me a cuff on the ear  if her woman and Mrs  Jewkes had not   interposed  Why did you not come out at the door  Because  said I    her ladyship sat in the chair against it  one while  and another while   locked it  else I offered several times to get away       She knew I expected you here  You say  you shewed her my letter to   you  Yes  sir  said I  but I had better not  for she as then more   exasperated  and made strange comments upon it  I doubt it not  said he    but  did she not see  by the kind epithets in it  that there was no room   to doubt of our being married  O  sir  replied I  and made the company   smile  she said  For that very reason she was sure I was not married       That s like my sister  said he  exactly like her  and yet she lives   very happily herself  for her poor lord never contradicts her  Indeed he
