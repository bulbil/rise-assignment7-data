had some expectations from the esteem and affection of his natural subjects  but he soon shewed  that all his skill was only in making enemies  but that he wanted abilities to reconcile them  The clergy had  for some time  acted as a separate body  and had their elections of each other generally confirmed by the Pope  the election of Archbishops had  for some time  been a continual subject of dispute between the suffragan Bishops and the Augustine Monks  and both had precedents to confirm their pretensions  things being in this situation  the Archbishop of Canterbury happened to die  and the Augustine Monks  in a private manner  made choice of Reginald  their Subprior  The Bishops exclaimed at this as invading their privileges  and here was likely to begin a theological contest  A politic Prince would have managed the quarrel in such a manner  as to let the body of the clergy thus grow weaker by division  but John was not a politic Prince  he immediately sided with the suffragan Bishops  and the Bishop of Norwich was unanimously chosen  To decide these differences  an appeal was made to the Pope  Innocent III  who then filled the chair  possessed an unbounded share of power  and his talents were equal to the veneration he was held in  he vacated both claims  and enjoined the Monks to chuse Stephen Langton  an Englishman then at the court of Rome  John knew how to oppose  though not to negociate  he received the Pope s decree with a degree of ungoverned fury  and returned   94 the Pope a letter filled with abuse  Innocent  in return  put the whole kingdom of England under an interdict  and forbad the King s subjects longer to obey him  These ecclesiastical thunders were  at that time  truly formidable  and the more so  as the execution of them was committed to Philip Augustus  King of France  an ambitious and a politic Prince  To him the Pope gave the kingdom of England  as a perpetual inheritance  assuring him of a remission of all his sins  if he happened to succeed in conquering it  He granted all who embarked in this cause also the same indulgences as were usually given to such as went upon a crusade  Philip immediately embraced the offer  not content with depriving John of his continental dominions  he devoured  in imagination  the kingdom of England also  By his preparations it was evident how desirous he was to succeed in this undertaking  the ships  of which his fleet was to consist  came together to the mouth of the Seine  whilst the Princes  his vassals  collected their forces to the shore from all parts of the country  His army was numerous  and the discontents of the English were equivalent to thousands more  Philip was ready  therefore  to set sail  and John  on his part  made an expiring effort to receive him  All hated as he was  the natural enmity between the French and the English  the name of a King  and some remaining share of power  put him at the head of an army of sixty thousand men  with which he advanced to Dover   Europe regarded such important preparations with impatience  and the decisive blow was soon expected  The Pope was too refined a politician for both  and took upon himself what he pretended to have designed for Philip  This singular negotiation   95 was executed by Pandulph  as the Pope s legate to France and England  He passed through France  where he beheld Philip s great armament  and highly commended his zeal and diligence  from thence he went over to Dover  under pretence of negotiating with the Barons  in favour of the French King  and had a conference with John upon his arrival  He there represented the number of the enemy  the hatred of many of his own subjects  he intimated  that there was but one way to secure himself from impending danger  which was  to put himself under the Pope s protection  who  as a kind and merciful father  was still willing to receive him to his bosom   John was too much intimidated by the apparent danger  not to embrace every means of offered safety  He consented to the legate s remonstrances  and took an oath to perform what the Pope should impose  Having thus sworn to perform he knew not what  the artful Italian so well managed the Barons  and intimidated the King  that he took the following extraordinary oath  before all the people  kneeling upon his knees  and putting his hands between those of the Legate      I John  by the grace of God  King of England and Lord of Ireland  in order to expiate my sins  from my own free will  and the advice of my Barons  give to the church of Rome  to Pope Innocent  and his successors  the kingdom of England  and all other prerogatives of my crown  I will hereafter hold them as the Pope s vassal  I will be faithful to God  to the church of Rome  and to the Pope my master  and his successors legitimately elected  I promise to pay him a tribute of a thousand marks yearly  to wit  seven hundred for the   96
