greatly favoured friend is not so free  as he hoped she was  It is a pleasure to me  however  because it is such to him  that it is not his fault  but her own  that she is not   The Countess  whom he so justly praises  writes to me  and I answer—But to what purpose  I am afraid  that a very important observation of his comes not in time to do me service  since if my prudence is proportion d to my trials  I ought to have endeavour d to exert it sooner   But  it seems there is an insuperable objection against the poor Lady s going into a Nunnery  I never heard of that before  It seems right to the Marchioness  that the young Lady  who is intituled to a great share of this world s goods  should not be dedicated to heaven  This may be so in the family eye  for aught I know  But I am persuaded  that if there is any one of it  who would not have pleaded this obstacle to a divine dedication  it would be Clementina herself  And yet I own  I can allow of their regret  that the cruel Laurana should be a gainer by Clementina s being lost  as I may say  to the world   Your brother s kind remembrance of Mr  and Mrs  Reeves  is an honour done to me  as well as to them  I must take it so  Lady G  And what he says of me in the paragraph in which he mentions Emily  adds to the pride he had raised in me before   Dr  Bartlett is extremely obliging  in not offering to with hold any passage in your brother s Letters from us  I have let him know  that I think him so  and have begged him not to spare any thing out of tenderness Page  41 to me  on a supposition that I may be affected  or made uneasy by what your brother shall write to him  This is speaking very plainly  my dear  But it is to Dr  Battlett  and he signified to us  more than once  that he could not be a stranger to the heart of your Harriet   And now  my dear Lady G  let me ask you  in my turn  What you think of one passage in your brother s Letter  of which you have not taken the least notice in yours to me     Charlotte  I hope  is happy  if she be not  it must be her own fault      You have honestly owned in your last  yet too roguishly for a true penitent  that it was evidently so in the debate about being presented  Miss Grandison used to like the drawing room well enough  Her brother has owned  in my hearing  as well as in yours  that had he not been so long out of England  and  since his return to it so seldom in town  he would have made it a part of his duty  to pay his attendance there  at proper times  But Lady G  forsooth  disdained to appear as the property  Reflect but  my dear  how absurd  of a worthy man  to whom she had vowed love  honour  and obedience   I should not remind you thus of past flippancies  did not new ones seem to spring up every day   For heaven s sake  my dear Lady G  let it not be carried from England to Italy  that Lord G  is not so happy with a sister of Sir Charles Grandison  as might be expected  left it be asked  Whether that sister  and this brother  had the same mother  I have written before all that I could possibly say on this subject  You know yourself to be wrong  It would be impertinence to expostulate further on a duty so known  and acknowleged  No more  therefore  on this head  authorize me to say  for ever   As to my health—I would fain be well  I am more sorry  that I am not  for the sake of my friends  who are incessantly grieving for me  than for my own  I Page  42 have not  I think I have not  any thing to reproach myself with  nor yet any body to reproach me  To whom have I given cause of triumph over me  by my ill usage  or insolence to him  I yield to an event to which I ought to submit  And to a woman  not less  but more worthy than myself  and who has a prior claim   I long to hear of the meeting of this noble pair  May it be propitious  May Sir Charles Grandison have the satisfaction  and the merit with the family  of being the means of restoring to reason  a greater restoration than to health  the woman  every faculty of whose soul ought  in that case  to be devoted to GOD  and to him  Methinks I have at present but one wish  it is  that I may live to see this Lady  if she is to be the happy woman  Could I  do you think
