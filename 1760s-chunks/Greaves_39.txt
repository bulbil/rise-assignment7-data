was in a retrograde direction  The thief  seeing all his endeavours ineffectual  and himself in danger of being overtaken  wisely quitted his acquisition  and fled into the bosom of a neighbouring wood   Then the knight inquired about the situation of the lady in the coach  and offered himself as her guard and conductor  but was told that she was already safely lodged in the house of a gentleman at some distance from the road  He likewise learned that she was a person disordered in her senses  under the care and tuition of a widow lady  her relation  and that in a day or two they should pursue their journey northward to the place of her habitation   After the footman had been some time dismissed  the knight recollected that he had forgot to ask the name of the person to whom he belonged  and began to be uneasy at this omission  which indeed was more interesting than he could imagine  For an explanation of this nature would  in all likelihood  have led to a discovery  that the lady in the coach was no other than Miss Aurelia Darnel  who seeing him unexpectedly in such an equipage and attitude  as he passed the coach  for his helmet was off  had screamed with surprise and terror  and fainted away  Nevertheless  when she recovered from her swoon  she concealed the real cause of her agitation  and none of her attendants were acquainted with the person of Sir Launcelot   The circumstances of the disorder under which she was said to labour shall be revealed in due course  In the meantime  our adventurer  though unaccountably affected  never dreamed of such an occurrence  but being very much fatigued  resolved to indemnify himself for the loss of last night s repose  and this happened to be one of the few things in which Crabshaw felt an ambition to follow his master s example             CHAPTER NINE  WHICH MAY SERVE TO SHOW  THAT TRUE PATRIOTISM IS OF NO PARTY   The knight had not enjoyed his repose above two hours  when he was disturbed by such a variety of noises  as might have discomposed a brain of the firmest texture  The rumbling of carriages  and the rattling of horses  feet on the pavement  was intermingled with loud shouts  and the noise of fiddle  French horn  and bagpipe  A loud peal was heard ringing in the church tower  at some distance  while the inn resounded with clamour  confusion  and uproar   Sir Launcelot being thus alarmed  started from his bed  and running to the window  beheld a cavalcade of persons well mounted  and distinguished by blue cockades  They were generally attired like jockies  with gold laced hats and buckskin breeches  and one of them bore a standard of blue silk  inscribed in white letters  LIBERTY AND THE LANDED INTEREST  He who rode at their head was a jolly figure  of a florid complexion and round belly  seemingly turned of fifty  and  in all appearance  of a choleric disposition  As they approached the market place  they waved their hats  huzzaed  and cried aloud  NO FOREIGN CONNEXIONS —OLD ENGLAND FOR EVER  This acclamation  however  was not so loud or universal  but that our adventurer could distinctly hear a counter cry from the populace of  NO SLAVERY —NO POPISH PRETENDER  an insinuation so ill relished by the cavaliers  that they began to ply their horsewhips among the multitude  and were  in their turn  saluted with a discharge or volley of stones  dirt  and dead cats  in consequence of which some teeth were demolished  and many surtouts defiled   Our adventurer s attention was soon called off from this scene  to contemplate another procession of people on foot  adorned with bunches of orange ribbons  attended by a regular band of music  playing God save great George our King  and headed by a thin swarthy personage  of a sallow aspect  and large goggling eyes  arched over with two thick semicircles of hair  or rather bristles  jet black  and frowsy  His apparel was very gorgeous  though his address was very awkward  he was accompanied by the mayor  recorder  and heads of the corporation  in their formalities  His ensigns were known by the inscription  Liberty of Conscience  and the Protestant Succession  and the people saluted him as he passed with repeated cheers  that seemed to prognosticate success  He had particularly ingratiated himself with the good women  who lined the street  and sent forth many ejaculatory petitions in his favour   Sir Launcelot immediately comprehended the meaning of this solemnity  He perceived it was the prelude to the election of a member to represent the county in parliament  and he was seized with an eager desire to know the names and characters of the competitors   In order to gratify this desire  he made repeated application to the bell rope that depended from the ceiling of his apartment  but this produced nothing  except the repetition of the words   Coming  sir   which echoed from three or four different corners of the house  The waiters were so distracted by a variety of calls  that they stood motionless  in the state of the schoolman s ass between
