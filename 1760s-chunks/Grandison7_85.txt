her cloaths  acknowleged rashness  which she laid at the door of Love  and so forth  The guardian desired a meeting with the Love yers  now no more Love yers  but man and wife  They met  with trembling on her side  with pretended apprehension on Sir Arthur s  for having disobliged so good a guardian  The guardian was in high good humour  He forgave them both  at the first word  and surrendered up his trust with pleasure  The girl was surprized at his unexpected goodness  and had she not been actually nailed down by the Solemnity  would very probably have again resumed her heroics   Well  but I am charmed with Mrs  Shirley s Eggleton  as well as with her account of herself in her heroic days  Little did I think that she ever was girl enough to be infected  But  as she says  romances were the fashionable reading of her youthful years   Tell aunt Selby that I am not an enemy to old maids  but only to those ill qualities which I should equally dislike in old or in young Any bodies  I love Lady Gertrude  and even aunt Eleanor  for those qualities that are love able in them  But you see that your Nancy  the mild  good natured Nancy  could not forbear laughing at the idea of the young old Penelope Arby  Yet knows she not  says the malicious Lucy  what may be her own case  But I have appealed for you  and to whom  To Lady Gertrude  I was writing to her on a particular occasion  when your   218 pacquet was brought me  and  in order to enliven my subject  transcribed three lines of Lucy s query upon defending the single state  She was but at Enfield  and returned me the following by the same messenger  the other part of my Letter requiring an immediate answer      Your question  my dearest niece  is whimsically asked  You tell me that a whole room full of young country ladies wait only the success of an appeal you have referred to me  to know whether they shall out of hand dispose of themselves to recruiting officers  mountebanks  and fox hunters  or venture to live on with the melancholy title of old maids  in an unsupported  undesended state        One or two queries to be put  proceeds the Sage are  Whether the worthy matches you have mentioned  or any unsuitable matches whatsoever  would be a support and defence  Whether the woman who makes a rash and improper choice  does not throw herself out of that protection and defence which every one may depend upon in the state of life marked out to them by Providence  And whether the single state is not thus marked out to the woman who never has it fitly in her choice to change it        I  my dear  who am an old maid  must not write partially on that side of the question  In general  I will fairly own  that I think a woman is most likely to find her proper happiness in the married state  May you  my dear niece  experience it every day more and more —But there are surely many exceptions  Women of large and independent fortunes  who have the hearts and understanding to use them as they ought  are often more beneficial to the world  than they would have been had they bestowed them on such men as look for fortune only  Women who have by their numerous relations many connexions in the world  need not   219 seek out of their own alliances for protection and defence  Ill health  peculiarity of temper or sentiments  unhappiness of situation  of person  afford often such reasons  as make it a virtue to refuse what it would otherwise be right to accept        But why do I write seriously to such a lively creature  Only  my dear   —    But  girls  I will give you no more of Lady Gertrude  I have not done with you myself yet   Much to the same purpose  I remember  as Mrs  Shirley s  were the expostulations of Lady D  in one of her Letters to Harriet  who only answered her   I also remember  like a girl  What could she say      You  my Harriet    wrote that Lady    are pious  dutiful  benevolent—Cannot you  if you are unable to entertain  for the man who now with so much ardour addresses you  were you married to him  the passion called Love  regard him as Gratitude would oblige you to prefer any other man who is assiduous to do you service or pleasure  Cannot you shew him as much good will  as you could any other man  whom it was in your power to make happy  Would you esteem him less than a person absolutely a stranger to you  The exertion of your native benevolence  of your natural obligingness  of your common gratitude  of your pity  is all that is asked of you  You have no expectation of the only man  who is dearer to you than he  This exertion will make my Lord
