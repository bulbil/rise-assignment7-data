 them  to morrow I will lay ten thousand more in your lap  In a word  you  shall be mistress of my whole estate  and I shall think myself happy in  living dependent on your bounty    Heavens  what were the emotions of the virtuous  the sensible  the  delicate  the tender Emilia s heart  when she heard this insolent  declaration from the mouth of a man whom she had honoured with her  affection and esteem  It was not simply horror  grief  or indignation   that she felt  in consequence of this unworthy treatment  but the united  pangs of all together  which produced a sort of hysteric laughter  while  she told him that she could not help admiring his generosity   Deceived by this convulsion  and the ironical compliment that attended  it  the lover thought he had already made great progress in his  operations  and that it was now his business to storm the fort by a  vigorous assault  that he might spare her the confusion of yielding  without resistance  Possessed by this vain suggestion  he started up   and  folding her in his arms  began to obey the furious dictates of his  unruly and ungenerous desire  With an air of cool determination  she  demanded a parley  and when  upon her repeated request  he granted it   addressed herself to him in these words  while her eyes gleamed with all  the dignity of the most awful resentment       6 22 15  3 45 PM    Sir  I scorn to upbraid you with a repetition of your former vows  and protestations  nor will I recapitulate the little arts you have  practised to ensnare my heart  because  though by dint of the most  perfidious dissimulation you have found means to deceive my opinion   your utmost efforts have never been able to lull the vigilance of my  conduct  or to engage my affection beyond the power of discarding you  without a tear  whenever my honour should demand such a sacrifice   Sir  you are unworthy of my concern or regret  and the sigh that now  struggles from my breast is the result of sorrow  for my own want of  discernment  As for your present attempt upon my chastity  I despise  your power  as I detest your intention  Though  under the mask of the  most delicate respect  you have decoyed me from the immediate protection  of my friends  and contrived other impious stratagems to ruin my  peace and reputation  I confide too much in my own innocence  and the  authority of the law  to admit one thought of fear  much less to sink  under the horror of this shocking situation  into which I have been  seduced  Sir  your behaviour on this occasion is  in all respects  low  and contemptible  For  ruffian as you are  you durst not harbour the  thought of executing your execrable scheme  while you knew my brother  was near enough to prevent or revenge the insult  so that you must not  only be a treacherous villain  but also a most despicable coward    Having expressed herself in this manner  with a most majestic severity  of aspect  she opened the door  and walking down stairs with  surprising resolution  committed herself to the care of a watchman  who  accommodated her with a hackney chair  in which she was safely conveyed  to her uncle s house   Meanwhile  the lover was so confounded and overawed by these cutting  reproaches  and her animated behaviour  that all his resolution forsook  him  and he found himself not only incapable of obstructing her retreat   but even of uttering one syllable to deprecate her wrath  or extenuate  the guilt of his own conduct  The nature of his disappointment  and the  keen remorse that seized him  when he reflected upon the dishonourable  footing on which his character stood with Emilia  raised such  perturbation in his mind  that his silence was succeeded by a violent  fit of distraction  during which he raved like a bedlamite  and acted  a thousand extravagancies  which convinced the people of the house  a  certain bagnio  that he had actually lost his wits  Pipes  with great  concern  adopted the same opinion  and  being assisted by the waiters   hindered him  by main force  from running out and pursuing the fair  fugitive  whom  in his delirium  he alternately cursed and commended  with horrid imprecations and lavish applause  His faithful valet   having waited two whole hours  in hopes of seeing this gust of passion  overblown  and perceiving that the paroxysm seemed rather to increase   very prudently sent for a physician of his master s acquaintance   who  having considered the circumstances and symptoms of the disorder   directed that he should be plentifully blooded  without loss of time   and prescribed a draught to compose the tumult of his spirits  These  orders being punctually performed  he grew more calm and tractable   recovered his reflection so far as to be ashamed of the ecstasy he had  undergone  and
