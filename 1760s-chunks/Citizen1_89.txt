some pain  in order to extend the sphere of his enjoyments  But on the contrary  he finds his desire for pleasure often lessen  as he takes pains to be able to improve it  and his capacity of enjoyment diminishes as his fortune happens to encrease   Instead therefore of regarding the great with envy  I generally consider them with some share of compassion  I look upon them as a set of good natured misguided people  who are indebted to us and not to themselves for all the happiness they enjoy  For our pleasure  and not their own  they sweat under a cumberous heap of finery  for our pleasure the lacquied train  the slow parading ant  with all the gravity of grandeur  moves in review  a single coat  or a single footman  answers all the purposes of the most indolent refinement as well  and those who have twenty  may be said to keep one for their own pleasure  and the other nineteen merely for ours  So true is the observation of Confucius  that we take greater pains to persuade others that we are happy  than in endeavouring to think so ourselves   But though this desire of being seen  of being made the subject of discourse  and of supporting the dignities of an exalted station  be troublesome enough to the ambitious  yet it is well for society that there are men thus willing to exchange ease and safety  for danger and a ribbon  We lose nothing by their vanity  and it would be unkind to endeavour to deprive a child of its rattle  If a Duke or a Dutchess are willing to carry a long train for our entertainment  so much the worse for themselves  if they chuse to exhibit in   282 public with a hundred lacquies and Mameluks in their equi for our entertainment  still so much the worse for themselves  it is the spectators alone who give and receive the pleasure  they only the sweating figures that swell the ant   A Mandarine who took much pride in appearing with a number of jewels on every part of his robe  was once accosted by an old sly Bonze  who following him through several streets  and bowing often to the ground  thank d him for his jewels  What does the man mean  cried the Mandarine  Friend  I never gave thee any of my jewels  No  replied the other  but you have let me look at them  and that is all the use you can make of them yourself  so there is no difference between us  except that you have the trouble of watching them  and that is an employment I don t much desire  Adieu   LETTER LXII  From the same   THO  not very fond of seeing a ant myself  yet I am generally pleased with being in the crowd which sees it  it is amusing to observe the effect which such a spectacle has upon the variety of faces  the pleasure it excites in some  the envy in others  and the wishes it raises in all  With this design I lately went to see the entry of a foreign Ambassador  resolved to make one in the mob  to shout as they shouted  to fix with earnestness upon the   283 same frivolous objects  and participate for a while the pleasures and the wishes of the vulgar   Struggling here for some time  in order to be first to see the cavalcade as it passed  some one of the crowd unluckily happened to tread upon my shoe  and tore it in such a manner  that I was utterly unqualified to march forward with the main body  and obliged to fall back in the rear  Thus rendered incapable of being a spectator of the shew myself  I was at least willing to observe the spectators  and limped behind like one of the invalids which follow the march of an army   In this plight  as I was considering the eagerness that appeared on every face  how some bustled to get foremost  and others contented themselves with taking a transient peep when they could  how some praised the four black servants  that were stuck behind one of the equis  and some the ribbons that decorated the horses necks in another  my attention was called off to an object more extraordinary than any that I had yet seen  A poor cobler sate in his stall by the way side  and continued to work while the crowd passed by  without testifying the smallest share of curiosity  I own his want of attention excited mine  and as I stood in need of his assistance  I thought it best to employ a philosophic cobler on this occasion  perceiving my business  therefore  he desired me to enter and sit down  took my shoe in his lap  and began to mend it with his usual indifference and taciturnity    How  my friend  said I to him  can you continue to work while all those sine things are   284 passing by your door    Very fine they are master  returned the cobler  for those that like them  to be sure  but what are all those fine things to me  You don t know what it is to be a cobler  and so much the better for yourself  Your bread is baked  you may
