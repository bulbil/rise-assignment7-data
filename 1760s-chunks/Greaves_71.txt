would the apothecary s conscience was as clear  — Are you thirsty  — Not thirsty enough to drink barley water   — Be pleased to look into his fauces   said the apothecary   he has got a rough tongue  and a very foul mouth  I ll assure you  — I have known that the case with some limbs of the faculty  where they stood more in need of correction than of physic —Well  my honest friend  since you have already undergone the proper purgations in due form  and say you have no other disease than the doctor  we will set you on your legs again without further question  Here  nurse  open that window  and throw these phials into the street  Now lower the curtain  without shutting the casement  that the man may not be stifled in his own steam  In the next place  take off two thirds of these coals  and one third of these blankets —How dost feel now  my heart    I should feel heart whole  if so be as yow would throw the noorse a ter the bottles  and the  pothecary a ter the noorse  and oorder me a pound of chops for my dinner  for I be so hoongry  I could eat a horse behind the saddle    The apothecary  seeing what passed  retired of his own accord  holding up his hands in sign of astonishment  The nurse was dismissed in the same breath  Crabshaw rose  dressed himself without assistance  and made a hearty meal on the first eatable that presented itself to view  The knight passed the evening with the physician  who  from his first appearance  concluded he was mad  but  in the course of the conversation  found means to resign that opinion without adopting any other in lieu of it  and parted with him under all the impatience of curiosity  The knight  on his part  was very well entertained with the witty sarcasms and erudition of the doctor  who appeared to be a sort of cynic philosopher tinctured with misanthropy  and at open war with the whole body of apothecaries  whom however it was by no means his interest to disoblige   Next day  Crabshaw  being to all appearance perfectly recovered  our adventurer reckoned with the apothecary  paid the landlord  and set out on his return for the London road  resolving to lay aside his armour at some distance from the metropolis  for  ever since his interview with Aurelia  his fondness for chivalry had been gradually abating  As the torrent of his despair had disordered the current of his sober reflection  so now  as that despair subsided  his thoughts began to flow deliberately in their ancient channel  All day long he regaled his imagination with plans of connubial happiness  formed on the possession of the incomparable Aurelia  determined to wait with patience  until the law should supersede the authority of her guardian  rather than adopt any violent expedient which might hazard the interest of his passion   He had for some time travelled in the turnpike road  when his reverie was suddenly interrupted by a confused noise  and when he lifted up his eyes he beheld at a little distance a rabble of men and women  variously armed with flails  pitchforks  poles  and muskets  acting offensively against a strange figure on horseback  who  with a kind of lance  laid about him with incredible fury  Our adventurer was not so totally abandoned by the spirit of chivalry  to see without emotion a single knight in danger of being overpowered by such a multitude of adversaries  Without staying to put on his helmet  he ordered Crabshaw to follow him in the charge against those plebeians  Then couching his lance  and giving Bronzomarte the spur  he began his career with such impetuosity as overturned all that happened to be in his way  and intimidated the rabble to such a degree  that they retired before him like a flock of sheep  the greater part of them believing he was the devil in propria persona  He came in the very nick of time to save the life of the other errant  against whom three loaded muskets were actually levelled  at the very instant that our adventurer began his charge  The unknown knight was so sensible of the seasonable interposition  that  riding up to our hero   Brother   said he   this is the second time you have holp me off  when I was bump ashore —Bess Mizzen  I must say  is no more than a leaky bum boat  in comparison of the glorious galley you want to man  I desire that henceforth we may cruise in the same latitudes  brother  and I ll be d—ned if I don t stand by you as long as I have a stick standing  or can carry a rag of canvas    By this address our knight recognised the novice Captain Crowe  who had found means to accommodate himself with a very strange suit of armour  By way of helmet  he wore one of the caps used by the light horse  with straps buckled under his chin  and contrived in such a manner as to conceal his whole visage  except the eyes  Instead of cuirass  mail  greaves  and other pieces of complete armour  he was cased
