supper  in short  it was charming       I am half inclined to marry  I am not at all acquainted with the man I have fixed upon  I never spoke to him till last night  nor did he take the least notice of me  more than of other ladies  but that is nothing  he pleases me better than any man I have seen here  he is not handsome  but well made  and looks like a gentleman  he has a good character  is heir to a very pretty estate  I will think further of it  there is nothing more easy than to have him if I chuse it   tis only saying to some of his friends  that I think Captain Fitzgerald the most agreable fellow here  and he will immediately be astonished he did not sooner find out I was the handsomest woman  I will consider this affair seriously  one must marry   tis the mode  every body marries  why don t you marry  Lucy       This brother of yours is always here  I am surprized Sir George is not jealous  for he pays no sort of attention to me   tis easy to see why he comes  I dare say I shan t see him next week  Emily is going to Mrs  Melmoth s  where she stays till to morrow sevennight  she goes from hence as soon as dinner is over       Adieu  I am fatigued  we danced till morning  I am but this moment up   Yours   A  FERMOR       Your brother danced with Mademoiselle Clairaut  do you know I was piqued he did not give me the preference  as Emily danced with her lover  not but that I had perhaps a partner full as agreable  at least I have a mind to think so       I hear it whispered that the whole affair of the wedding is to be settled next week  my father is in the secret  I am not  Emily looks ill this morning  she was not gay at the ball  I know not why  but she is not happy  I have my fancies  but they are yet only fancies       Adieu  my dear girl  I can no more     LETTER XXVI   26   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Quebec  Oct  6   I AM going  my Lucy  I know not well whither I am going  but I will not stay to see this marriage  Could you have believed it possible But what folly  Did I not know her situation from the first  Could I suppose she would break off an engagement of years  with a man who gives so clear a proof that he prefers her to all other women  to humor the frenzy of one who has never even told her he loved her       Captain Fermor assures me all is settled but the day  and that she has promised to name that to morrow       I will leave Quebec to night  no one shall know the road I take  I do not yet know it myself  I will cross over to Point Levi with my valet de chambre  and go wherever chance directs me  I cannot bear even to hear the day named  I am strongly inclined to write to her  but what can I say  I should betray my tenderness in spite of myself  and her compassion would perhaps disturb her approaching happiness  were it even possible she should prefer me to Sir George  she is too far gone to recede       My Lucy  I never till this moment felt to what an excess I loved her       Adieu  I shall be about a fortnight absent  by that time she will be embarked for England  I cannot bring myself to see her the wife of another  Do not be alarmed for me  reason and the impossibility of success will conquer my passion for this angelic woman  I have been to blame in allowing myself to see her so often   Yours   ED  RIVERS     LETTER XXVII   27   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Beaumont  Oct  7   I THINK I breathe a freer air now I am out of Quebec  I cannot bear wherever I go to meet this Sir George  his triumphant air is insupportable  he has  or I fancy he has  all the insolence of a happy rival   tis unjust  but I cannot avoid hating him  I look on him as a man who has deprived me of a good to which I foolishly fancy I had pretensions        My whole behaviour has been weak to the last degree  I shall grow more reasonable when I no longer see this charming woman  I ought sooner to have taken this step       I have found here an excuse for my excursion  I have heard of an estate to be sold down the river  and am told the purchase will be less expence than clearing any lands I might take up  I will go and see it  it is an object  a pursuit  and will amuse me       I am going to send my servant back to Quebec  my
