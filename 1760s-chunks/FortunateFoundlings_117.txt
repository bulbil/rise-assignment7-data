 and as they   were now resolved to quit the city extremely early  the prince took   leave of them that night  and in doing so put a purse of gold into the   hands of every one to defray the expenses of their travelling  This   behaviour obliged them to own there was a possibility of sowing the   seeds of humanity in Muscovy  and that the czar had made some progress   in influencing those about him with the manners he had himself learned   in the politer courts             CHAP  XXII        What befel Louisa in the monastery  the stratagem she put in practice   to get out of it  her travels thro  Italy  and arrival in Paris        But while Horatio was thus experiencing the vicissitudes of fortune  his   beautiful sister suffered little less from the caprice of that fickle   goddess  Placed as she was  one would have thought she had been secure   from all the temptations  hurries  and dangers of the world  and that   nothing but the death or inconstancy of monsieur du Plessis could have   again involved her in them  These  indeed  were the sole evils she   trembled at  and which she chiefly prayed might not befal her  Yet as it   often happens that those disasters which seem most remote are nearest to   us  so did the disappointments she was ordained to suffer  rise from a   quarter she had the least reason to apprehend       The abbess and nuns  with whom she was  being all Italians  she set   herself to attain to the knowledge of their language  in which she soon   became a very great proficient  and capable of entertaining them  and   being entertained by them in the most agreeable manner   The sweetness   of her temper  as well as her good sense  rendering her always ambitious   of acquiring the affection of those she converted with  she had the   secret to ingratiate herself not only to the youngest nuns  but also to   the elder and most austere  that the one were never pleased but when in   her company  and the others propose her as an example of piety and   sweetness to the rest       She had a very pretty genius to poetry  and great skill in music  both   which talents she now exercised in such works as suited the place and   company she was in   The hymns and anthems she composed were not only   the admiration of that convent  but also of several others to whom they   were shown  and she was spoke of as a prodigy of wit and devotion       In fine  her behavior rendered her extremely dear to the superior  and   that affection joined to a spiritual pride  which those sanctified   devotees are seldom wholly free from  made her very desirous of   retaining her always in the convent   she was therefore continually   preaching up to her the uncertainty of those felicities which are to be   found in the world  and magnifying that happy serenity which a total   renunciation from it afforded   nay  sometimes went so far  as to   insinuate there was scarce a possibility for any one encumbered with the   cares  and surrounded with the temptations of a public life  to have   those dispositions which are requisite to enjoy the blessings of   futurity   Ah my dear daughter  would she say frequently to her  how   much should I rejoice to find in you a desire to forgo all the   transitory fleeting pleasures of the world  and devote yourself entirely   to heaven   what raptures would not your innocent soul partake  when   wholly devoid of all thought of sensual objects  you would be  even   while on earth  a companion for angels and blessed spirits  and borne on   the wings of heavenly contemplation  have your dwelling above  and be   worshipped as a saint below       All the old nuns  and some of the young ones  assisted their abbess in   endeavouring to prevail on Louisa to take the veil  but all that they   said made no impression on her mind  not but she had more real piety   than perhaps some of those who made so great a shew of it  but she was   of a different way of thinking  and tho  she knew the world had its   temptation  having experienced them in a very great degree  yet she   was convinced within herself  that a person of virtuous principles might   be no less innocent out of a cloyster than in one   She saw also among   this sisterhood a great deal of envy to each other  and perceived early   that the flaming zeal professed among them was in some hypocrisy  and   enthusiasm in others  so
