  as one and the same thing   and yet  my Harry  there is a thing of   which it may be said  that the more we desire it the less we want   it  and that the less we desire of it  the greater is our want      What in the world can that be  father  It is goodness  my   love  Well  says Harry  I will not puzzle my brains about nice   matters  All I know is  that no man has more goodness than he   wants  except it be yourself  I do not talk of women  for I believe   Mrs  Clement here is very good   pray  look in her face  father do   not you think she is very good      I see  Harry  said Mr  Fenton  that young as you are you are   a perfect physiognomist  Why  pray  sir  said Arabella  is it in   earnest your opinion  that the character of mind or manners may   in any measure be gathered from the form of the countenance    Is not the world filled with stories of deceit and treachery of such   false appearances   You remember how Horace says  that a prudent   mariner puts no trust in the gildings or paintings of a ship   such    superficial glossings  as one might think  ought rather to be sus    pected of an intention to conceal the rottenness of the timber    And then the passage of the famous physiognomists at Athens  so   often quoted as a proof of capacity and knowledge in this way    proves wholly the reverse as I take it  Their judgment of Socrates   is opposite to truth in every instance   they pronounced him the   most debauched  irascible  and malicious of men   and it is a very   poor apology that Socrates makes for their ignorance  when he   affirms that he was by birth the very person they deemed him  but   that philosophy had given him a new nature   for  if education can   change the heart without changing the countenance  how can we   form any conjecture of the one by the other      Though I insist  Mrs  Clement  that you are wrong in your   thesis  replied Mr  Fenton  I admit that you are perfectly just in   your inference  For if a change of mind or manners can make no   change in the aspect  the whole science of physiognomy must fall   to the ground  I therefore take this passage relating to Socrates   to be a mere fiction  and I affirm that neither philosophy nor   Christianity can make a new heart or a new nature in man  without   making a suitable alteration in his visage      As the heavens are made expressive of the glory of God  though   frequently overcast with clouds and tempests  and sometimes break    ing forth in thunders that terrify  and lightnings that blast  so   the general tenor of a human countenance is made expressive of   the nature of the soul that lives within  and to which it is ordained   an involuntary interpreter          TEE FOOL OF QUALITY  129     Many persons have made it the study of great part of their lives   to counteract Providence in this honest appointment   to shut   this window  by which an impertinent world is so apt to peep in    and spy what they are about  and  as far as possible  to make   the expressions of their countenance to belie every sentiment and   emotion of the heart      I have known hypocrisy  treachery  pride  malice  and lust    assume the opposite semblance of saintship  fidelity  lowliness    benevolence  and chastity  But it is painful to keep the bow of   nature long bent  its elasticity will still struggle to have it restored     and a skilful discerner  at the time of such delusion  will often   detect the difference between a real character and the acting of a   part  For when nature dictates  the whole man speaks   all is   uniform and consenting in voice  mien  motion  the turn of each   feature  and the cast of the eyes  But when art is the spokesman    and that nature is not altogether suppressed  the turn of the eye   may contradict the tongue  and the muscles of the face may coun    teract each other in their several workings  And thus I have   known an expression of resentment remain on the brow  while the   face laboured to invest itself with a smile of complacence   and   I have known the eye to burn with ill governed concupiscence    while voice  action  and address united in the avowal of chaste
