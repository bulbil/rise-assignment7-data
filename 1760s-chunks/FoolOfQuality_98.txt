mistress or Arabella      Soon after this good gentlewoman and her niece returned  dinner   was ordered up  and I sat down to table with a heart and coun    tenance more easy and cheerful than ordinary          78 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      Before the cloth was removed  Jenny came and delivered a note   to her mistress  She read it over and over with apparent surprise   and attention  asked if the messenger was waiting  and stepped to   the door  Again she returned  sat down without speaking a word    and the muscles of her countenance being strongly affected  she   could no longer retain her passion  and her tears burst forth      What is the matter   cried Arabella   my aunt my dear  dear   mother my only friend and parent   And  breaking also into tears    she threw herself about her neck      O  there is no bearing of this  exclaimed Mrs  Graves  This   young man  my Arabella  distresses us beyond expression  He has   this very clay  my love  for the second time  snatched us from   instant ruin  I would tell you if I could speak  but read that   note which she did accordingly      The note was signed Freestone Hardgrave  and imported how   sorry he was that his late losses by sea had put him under the   necessity of laying an execution on her house without customary   notice  That he was glad  however  she had so large a sum ready   as 90  the receipt of which he acknowledged  and hoped that this   affair would make no difference with respect to their future   dealings      And why  best and dearest of women  said I to Mrs  Graves   why would you grieve that I should endeavour to relieve myself   from a part of that burden with which your goodness and obliga    tions have so greatly oppressed me   O that it were in my power     I cried   and my hands pressed each other with an involuntary   ardour  But it never will it never can be possible for me to   prove the passion that my soul has for you  and there I hesitated   to show you  I say  the love that I have for you  Mrs  Graves    You two make my world  and all that I am concerned for or   desire therein      Since that is the case  said Mrs  Graves  with a smile and a tear   that glistened together  if you will admit an equal passion from one   so old as I am  it were pity we should ever part  Send  my child    this very day  and discharge your former lodgings  The time that   we spend together cannot but be happy  All cares are lessened by   the society of those we love   and our satisfactions will be doubled   by feeling for each other      I did not at that time know the whole reason of the delight with   which I accepted this generous invitation  I settled at Mrs    Graves s without any formal agreement  and all my little matters   were directly brought home      O  how happy were many succeeding days   How still more happy   when contrasted with the misery that ensued    We spent all the   time together that business and attention to the shop would permit    and we grudged every moment that was spent asunder  I related   to them a thousand entertaining stories  and passages occasionally   recollected from the poets and historians of antiquity   and a secret   emotion  and inward ardour for pleasing  gave me fluently to inter    sperse sentimental observations and pertinent digressions  more   delightful to my auditory than all my quoted authorities      I was now daily gathering health and strength  to which the com                THE FOOL OF QUALITY  79     placence of my mind greatly contributed   when one evening  Mrs    Graves returned more dejected than ordinary  I inquired into the   cause  with a solicitude and countenance that naturally expressed   the interest I took in her concerns  Why  my dear child  says she    perhaps I have been both impertinent and indiscreet  but I meant   all for the best  You must know  then  that I have been on a visit   to your father  To my father  madam  Even so  I would to   Heaven that he were worthy to be called father to such a son  But   as I was saying your father  Mr  Clement  is in great circum
