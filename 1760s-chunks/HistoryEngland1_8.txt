the Gaulish nations  which were at that time enemies of Rome  This might  probably  be the ground of his invasion  but the pleasure of conquest was his real motive  To extend the Roman empire  though already it was become too extensive to be governed  was at that time thought the most glorious atchievment of humanity  The rest of Europe was  in some measure  subdued  and nothing left but countries desolate by forests and marshes  and neither tempting  from their appearance  nor affording any hopes of plunder  from their poverty  Heroism was  at that time  the boast of ambition  nor have men  till very lately  been taught to consider conquerors with an eye of contempt or detestaticn    22 Caesar was resolved on being a hero  and was more fond of triumph than justice   His forces were composed of Germans  Batavians  and Gauls  and the flower of his veteran Roman legions  He set sail from Gaul about midnight  and arrived on the British coast about en in the afternoon  fifty five years before the Christian aera  The Britons  with their naked troops  made a brave opposition against this veteran army  the encounters between them were fierce  and many  the losses were mutual  and the success various  Cassibelaunus was chosen general in chief of the British forces  but even a foreign invader was not sufficient to keep the petty princes  which composed the barbarous army  united  Dissension soon entered amongst them  and some  jealous of the sincerity of their general  or envying his greatness  fled over to Caesar  submitted to the Romans  and claimed their protection  Others followed this base example  till Cassibelaunus  weakened by so many desertions  resolved upon making what terms he was able  while he had yet an opportunity  He sends to Caesar  acknowledges the Romanpower  agrees upon a certain tribute  and delivers hostages  Britain  from the beginning  has been remarkable for internal dissension  and dissension ever strengthens or invites the invader   The Romans were pleased with the name of a new conquest  and glad of ending an adventure with honour  which at first promised only difficulties and danger  But the extended forest  and the trackless wild  was not a quarry for men intent on spoil  and raised to greater expectations  Having  therefore  rather discovered than subdued the southern parts of the island  they returned into Gaul with their whole forces  and once more left   23 the Britons to their customs  religion  and laws  By two expeditions which Caesar made into this island  he rather increased the glory than the dominions of Rome  and gave Britain the honour of being the last triumph of that mighty republic  which had before reduced the most powerful kingdoms of the habitable globe   Whatever the tribute was  which they had contracted annually to pay  we have many reasons  from history  to believe  they paid it but very negligently  I mention this  as an instance of the little faith which can be expected from an extorted submission  while there is no longer a power to enforce obedience  During the reign of Augustus  that Emperor had formed a design of visiting Britain  but was diverted from it by an unexpected revolt of the Pannonians  Some years after  he again resumed his design  but  being met in his way by the British ambassadors  promising the accustomed tribute  and making the usual submissions  he a second time desisted  The year following  finding them unfaithful to their promise  he prepared  a third time  for the invasion of this island  but was prevented from putting his design into execution  by their ambassadors  who averted his fury by their adulations and humility  The most savage countries understand flattery almost as well as the most polite  since  to be sufficiently servile is  perhaps  the whole of the art  and the truest method of pleasing   Tiberius followed the maxims of Augustus  and  wisely judging the Roman empire already too extensive  made no attempt upon this island  Some Roman soldiers being wrecked on the English coast  the inhabitants not only assisted them with the greatest humanity  but sent them  in   24 safety  back to their general  In consequence of such friendly dispositions  there was a constant intercourse between the two nations  the principal English nobility resorted to Rome  and some received their education there   By these means the Britons began sensibly to improve  The first art  which a savage people is generally taught by their politer neighbours  is that of war  Tho  not wholly addicted to the Roman manner of fighting  the Britons  however  adopted several of their improvements  both in their arms  and their arrangement in the field  Their ferocity to strangers was now also lessened  and they first began to coin money  the oldest British coin being that of Comius  who learned a part of the Roman politeness by a residence in Caesar s camp  They still  however  continued to live as herdsmen and hunters  and adhered to their usual superstitions  a manifest instance of the country being  as yet  but thinly inhabited  When we read  in Caesar  of the numbers of this
