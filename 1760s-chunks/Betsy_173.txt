reputation  I hope  is clear  your virtue not suspected  it is not to   accuse you of any guilt  but to prevent your innocence from becoming a   prey to the guilt of others  that Mr  Goodman sent you his dying   admonition  or that I took upon me to deliver it        Mr  Francis Thoughtless seconded what the other had said  and both   joining their endeavours to pacify the late tempest of her mind  she   soon recovered that good humour and chearfulness which was too natural   to her to be long suspended by any accident whatever        I flattered myself   said the younger of these gentlemen   that   cautions of this kind would have been altogether unnecessary  and that   before now you would have been disposed of to a man  under whose   protection all that is dear to your sex had been secure  I need not tell   you   continued he   that I mean Mr  Trueworth        Miss Betsy looking a little confused  and not making any reply  the   elder Mr  Thoughtless immediately took up the word  and said he had   heard so high a character of that gentleman s merit  that he had wished   for few things with more ardency than the honour of being allied to   him  and that he never could find out what objection his sister had to   accept of an offer so every way to her advantage       To this Miss Betsy made answer  though not without some disorder and   hesitation in her speech  that she had never made any objection either   to his person or qualifications  but that she did not care to marry yet   a while  and that he had not love enough to wait the event of her   resolution in that point  that  besides  their humours did not suit  and   there was little likelihood they would agree better after marriage  that   there had been a little pique between them  that he gave himself airs of   resenting something she had said  and thereupon had sent her a very   impertinent letter  since which she had never seen him   So that   added   she   our breaking off acquaintance is wholly owing to himself        Mr  Francis  not doubting but this letter would explain what he so much   desired to know the truth of  cried out to her hastily to let him see   it  Miss Betsy already repenting that she had mentioned such a thing  as   she was conscious there were some expressions in it which would greatly   countenance the disagreeable remonstrances she had just now received    but she wanted artifice to pretend she had either lost or burnt it  and   went that instant to her cabinet  where easily finding it  she gave it   into her brother s hands  with these words  He reproaches me   said she     with things I know nothing of  and in terms which  I think  do not very   well become the passion he pretended to have for me         That he once loved you   said Mr  Francis  coolly   I am very certain    How his sentiments may be changed  and the reasons of their being so    this may  perhaps  give me room to guess   He then read the letter   aloud  and  while he was doing so  several times cast a look at Miss   Betsy  which shewed he was highly dissatisfied with her  for having   given any cause for the reflections contained in it        I see very well   said he  returning her the letter   that he has done   with you  and that it is your own fault  I shall  however  talk to him   on the affair  and if there be a possibility of accommodating matters   between you  shall endeavour it for your sake        Here Miss Betsy s spirit rouzed itself  in spite of the respect she had   for her brothers   I beseech you  Sir   said she to Mr  Francis   not to   go about to force your sister upon any man  If Mr  Trueworth  of his own   accord  renews the professions he has made  I shall  on your account    receive them as I did before any misunderstanding happened between us    but as to changing my condition  either in favour of him or any other   man  I know not when  or whether ever  I shall be in the humour to do   it  You may  however  if you please   continued she   hear what he has   to say for himself  and what mighty matters against me  that can excuse
