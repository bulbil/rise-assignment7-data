all wits are  irresolute and froward as a baby  giddy as a drunken man  absent as a lunatic  as difficult to be pleased as a vexed ideot  and conceited as an Opera Singer     Oh  my dear  never have any thing to do with your geniuses  unless you can get one of them now and then to write a song upon you  for that very often helps a lady to many a good friend—but for all that  I never would have any connection with such sort of sparks—as to granting a man that made a good song upon me a favour  ang passawnt  as the French say  I should not mind it—but don t never  dear creature  be fond of them—no—the only men worth a lady s notice  are those gentlemen  who have no wit indeed  but then they have what is better than all the wit  genius and understanding in the world—and what most commonly wit  genius and understanding never have any thing to do with  and that is  MONEY—Money  my dear  Let but a lady have that—and she is sure of having  doing  saying  and being  just what she pleases     The next person to whom I was predestinated  happened to be neither a wit nor a scholar  nevertheless he was both a genius and a gentleman  because he was a gamester  As daring as a lyon   Page  27  he would as soon draw his sword as his snuff box  and was as quick as volatile salts     He valued his honour before any other consideration  in the way of playing any game at cards or dice  for he would sooner venture his life than be found out  so careful was he of his honour  You can t imagine how polite he was  and what fine company he kept  although  as I told you  he could hardly write his name  or spell a word of two syllables  but a gentleman s being ignorant of letters  is no proof against his politeness  for really  I believe  it would go very hard with some folks of the best company  if they were to be examined concerning their reading and writing     Miss JUSTICE   Very true  indeed  miss  but thank God  persons in polite life  are two well bred to be pedants  and I would no more ask any fine gentleman or lady after their scholarships  than I would after their religion  because both the one and the other s out of fashion now     Miss SHRED   Well  madam  my friend did such things in the money winning way  and with such grace —to be sure he lived like a nobleman  and mantained me like a dutchess  I had my equipage all upon gilded springs  and I used to scorn all low bred persons  as I called them  for walking a foot  because  as my friend used to tell me  nobody never need be poor  if they had but a spirit to do things — for if people wanted luck  they should make it  or else be punished with poverty for their faintheartedness —But  Page  28  for all that  what by the law  or by one thing or another  we dwindled  to be obliged to live in a two pair of stairs back room  madam  as you may do now  and I can t but say  we used to sit and think ourselves very ill done by Providence—because  why should we be poor  when we took as much pains in the proper way of getting fortunes  as ever any people did who got estates  as the fashion is now to get them  Well  madam  at last we parted  and he married a methodist s widow  with 500 l  a year jointure  and I engaged myself as a figure dancer at the Opera House  because I was told  a lady had a better chance there of being taken into keeping  than at the English Play houses  But I did not find the Opera people s taste so eager at intriguing with any of our sex  as I expected —O  curse that Italy  my dear—but no more of that—I grew very low  and I sent to my late friend  who had married the methodist s widow for a guinea  and his answer was  truly he had done with all the vanities of this life  and so should I  and that he would advise me not to look after money  but go and seek the Lord     Miss JUSTICE   But who am I to seek  who ll seek me     Miss SHRED   Nay  as to that  madam  never despair  remember what is said to you in the letter about your landlord David —I am sure it may be easily brought about for him to marry you  I have so often heard him say  what would he give for such a wife as you     Page   unnumbered      illustration    Page 7th  Case 1   Page  29  Miss JUSTICE   But  dear creature  would it not be immensely shocking  and
