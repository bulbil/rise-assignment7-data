to raise me from the ground at the same time  and ordering the rest to assist in carrying me to the coach—It was in vain I struggled—in vain I   141 shrieked for help—the monsters obeyed his commands with the most implicit readiness  and my spirits were at last so exhausted by the sharpness of my terror  and the fatigue of my resistance  that I sunk lifeless on the floor —In this state they easily carried me to the coach  and it was ten o clock next  or  more properly speaking  that morning  before I recovered my senses sufficiently to recollect any one circumstance of the whole transaction   About ten o clock  however  I came a little to myself  and found that I was in a very handsome bed  that the room was extremely well furnished  and that there were two female attendants with hartshorn  and a number of other restoratives  ready to administer every assistance which might be necessary for my recovery  From these women  who   142 were Sir Harry s house keeper and her daughter  I learned that I was brought to this house about four o clock in the morning  that several times on the road Sir Harry and his companions were in violent apprehensions for my life  that the moment they arrived I was consigned over to the care of the women  and that  till within the last two hours  I had been in the strongest hysterics imaginable  The housekeeper added  that she was sure her master must love me with the sincerest affection  for he had been like a distracted man on my account  and had repeatedly sworn to lay violent hands on himself  if my indisposition should be productive of any fatal consequences  As the women seemed to be not only communicative but good natured  weak as I was  I made them acquainted with their master s conduct  told them my name and family  and offered to reward them above their utmost   143 expectations if they could  by any fortunate contrivance  facilitate my escape —To this they replied  that they should be very willing to oblige me  but that their lives would not be safe if they acted in the least contrary to the will of their master—The youngest  particularly  thought it surprizing that I should wish to quit so fine a gentleman as Sir Harry  who had so great an estate  and who was ready  she was sure  to marry me the moment I thought proper to give my consent  From this  and some other expressions which dropped from the daughter  I found that she herself was in love with the wretch  and consequently thought it wonderful how any body else could mention him with the smallest indication either of aversion or contempt   Disappointed in my hopes of escaping by means of the women  and finding them entirely at the devotion of   144 their profligate master  I desired they would help me up  not knowing how soon they might leave me to the monster s brutality  They complied  but reluctantly  observing  that  after what I had undergone  rest was absolutely necessary for me  and declaring that they were certain I must be greatly indisposed  Indeed  Harriot  they said true  I was extremely ill  and  could I have removed my apprehensions of Sir Harry  I should have followed their advice with the utmost satisfaction  When they had dressed me  or  more properly speaking  when they restored my dress to a little order  they led me into the dining room  and prevailed upon me to swallow two dishes of tea  and a dish of chocolate  after this they withdrew  but the daughter returned in a few minutes after  to tell me that Sir Harry was coming to attend me  and the message was scarcely delivered before the horrid   145 fellow actually entered with an air of forced complaisance  very visibly mixed with some degree of confusion  and a great deal of malignity   I was sitting in a great chair when he entered  and  thinking it best to betray as little fear as possible  I fixed my eyes upon him with an intenseness of determined indignation  and asked him how long I was to remain a prisoner in his house  To which he replied  till I wanted an inclination to quit it —   But  madam   says he  seating himself on the opposite side of the fire place   I am now come to have a little serious conversation with you  and  as the nature of this conversation will be of the last importance to your own happiness  I hope  upon that account  you will favour me with your attention —From the closeness of our neighbourhood in the country  my dear Miss Mildmay    146 it is impossible but what some particulars of my conduct must have reached your family that were no way advantageous to my character—Yet from the same closeness of neighbourhood  you yourself must have heard that I declined all alliance with many young ladies of distinction  merely on account of my attachment for you  declaring that so long as you continued single  I never should think of any other woman—You also know  madam  that when you thought proper to reject my addresses  your whole house allowed my proposal to be extremely disinterested  and acknowledged that I did
