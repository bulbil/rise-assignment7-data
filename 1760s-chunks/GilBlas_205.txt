 where the whole household  with one consent  insisted on giving me the upper hand  Dinner is a busy time at an episcopal ordinary  and yet we snatched a moment to make our observations on each other  What a mortified propriety was painted on the outside of the clergy  They had all the look of a deputation from a better world  strange to think how place and circumstance impose on the deluded sense of men  It never once came into my thoughts that all this sanctity might possibly be a false coin  just as if there could be nothing but what appertained to the kingdom above  among the successors of the apostles on earth   I was seated by the side of an old valet de chambre  by name Melchior de la Ronda  He took care to help me to all the nice bits  His attentions were not lost upon me  and my good manners quite enraptured him  My worthy sir  said he  in a low voice after dinner  I should like to have a little private talk with you  At the same time he led the way to a part of the palace where we could not be overheard  and there addressed me as follows  My son  from the very first instant that I saw you  I felt a certain prepossession in your favour  Of this I will give you a certain proof  by communicating in confidence what will be of great service to you  You are here in a family where true believers and painted hypocrites are playing at cross purposes against each other  It would take an antediluvian age to feel the ground under your feet  I will spare so long and so disgusting a study  by letting you into the characters on both sides  After this  if you do not play your cards  it is your own fault   I shall begin with his grace  He is a very pious prelate  employed without ceasing in the instruction of the people  whom he brings back to virtue  like sheep gone astray  by sermons full of excellent morality  and written by himself  He has retired from court these twenty years  to watch over his flock with the zeal of an affectionate pastor  He is a very learned person  and a very impressive declaimer  his whole delight is in preaching  and his congregation take care he should know that their whole delight is in hearing him  There may possibly be some little leaven of vanity in all this heavenly mindedness  but  besides that it is not for human fallibility to search the heart  it would ill become me to rake into the faults of a person whose bread I eat  Were it decent to lay my finger on anything unbecoming in my master  I should discommend his starchness  Instead of exercising forbearance towards frail churchmen  he visits every peccadillo  as if it were a heinous offence  Above all  he prosecutes those with the utmost rigour of the spiritual court  who  wrapping themselves up in their innocence  appeal to the canons for their justification  in bar of his despotic authority  There is besides another awkward trait in his character  common to him with many other people of high rank  Though he is very fond of the people about him  he pays not the least attention to their services  but lets them sink into years without a moment s thought about securing them any provision  If at any time he makes them any little presents  they may thank the goodness of some one who shall have spoken up in their behalf  he would never have his wits enough about him to do the slightest thing for them as a volunteer   This is just what the old valet de chambre told me of his master  Next  he let me into what he thought of the clergymen with whom we had dined  His portraits might be likenesses  but they were too hard featured to be owned by the originals  It must be admitted  however  that he did not represent them as honest men  but only as very scandalous priests  Nevertheless  he made some exceptions  and was as loud in their praises as in his censure of the others  I was no longer at any loss how to play my part so as to put myself on an equal footing with these gentry  That very evening  at supper  I took a leaf out of their book  and arrayed myself in the convenient vesture of a wise and prudent outside  A clothing of humility and sanctification costs nothing  Indeed it offers such a premium to the wearer  that we are not to wonder if this world abounds in a description of people called hypocrites       CH  III     Gil Blas becomes the Archbishop s favourite  and the channel of all his favours   I HAD been after dinner to get together my baggage  and take my horse from the inn where I had put up  and afterwards returned to supper at the archbishop s palace  where a neatly furnished room was got ready for me  and such a bed as was more likely to pamper than to mortify the flesh  The day following  his grace sent for me quite as soon as I was ready to go to him  It was to give me a homily to
