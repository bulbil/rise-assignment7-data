expectation of the fatal messengers of death  and still their  horrid deed was suspended  A sudden and violent tumult recalled my dying  senses  the noise grew nearer and louder  I started at the clash of  arms  I heard a groan  The crowd prest in upon me  and I saw Les Roches   my kind preserver  his eyes darting rage  and his weapon reeking with  slaughter    There lies the wretch  said he  who dared to lift his sword  against my approach    I threw myself into his bloody arms  in a  rapturous extacy of joy and gratitude  and just found breath to exclaim   Gracious powers  am I then rescued from the base murderer s arm     Murder  cried Les Roches   for this horrid purpose then wert thou  detained here  But it is well  there wanted but this to confirm those  brave spirits  who feel and will revenge our wrongs  No prisoner now  No  concealed fugitive  Lord William shall confront his enemy  and take his  free course  undaunted and uncontrouled in the fair face of day  and  scorn the malice of this injurious Count  But hasteâ€”and let us join our  friends      I obeyed the joyful summons  but first searched for my armour  which the  guards  whose power was now expired  had taken from me  The attendants  of Les Roches buckled on my harness  and I once more  grasped my sword  I issued forth as if restored from the grave   accompanied by Les Roches and his companions  leading away my guards  whom they had overpowered  And scarcely had we measured out the  distance of an arrow s flight  when we descried a gallant troop marching  toward us  who raised a shout of triumph at our approach  and received  us with the joy of brethren and associates  I expressed my surprize  but  was soon taught the reason of this appearance  and the cause of my  surprizing change of fortune  I now learned that Malleon  like the  unskilful soldier who by the force of his own ill directed blow is  oftentimes tumbled to the ground  was defeated in the purposes of his  malice  by the blind and furious impetuosity of that very malice  In his  first rage of disappointed revenge  he had injured and insulted a brave  chief  who had ranged his numerous adherents under the banners of this  proud Count  and given their swords to support his power  The gentle  manners of Les Roches had ever commanded the affections of his  adherents  and now  when they saw their chief thrust into the vile  dungeon  in contempt of all his former services  and for no crime  but  the suspicion of having spared an helpless wanderer  their mutiny  like  the noise of distant thunder  tho  not violent  was yet terrible  and  struck the ear with the threatenings of an approaching storm  Mal leon  quickly perceived the danger  and endeavoured to corred his hasty error   by releasing Les Roches from his captivity  But little did this  ungracious condescension allay the ferment of his vassals  little did  the chief regard this extorted act of justice  as the reparation due to  his injured honour and little did it allay the ardor of his affection  and solicitude for the man he now called his friend  It was his first  care to employ the liberty he had regained  in my protection  and with  a few chosen followers he instantly hastened to the shore  whither he  had directed the faithful peasant to conduct me  But Salisbury was not  to be found  Yet still flattered with the hope that  my speed had prevented him  and that I had already embarqued  he  returned with his attendants  to whom he distinctly related our first  encounter in the island  and his cares to defend me from the malice of  my rival  They were taught to love me  to pity my fortunes  and to  rejoice in my supposed escape  The infection spread among their  associates  I became the general object of their discourse  when  suddenly  the peasant who had fled from me in wild affright  to inform  his master of my situation  arrived and acquainted them  that  amidst  all my dangers  I had obstinately resolved not to abandon my friend   but to share his fortune  in despite of all the power and cruelty of  Mal leon  Scarcely had he informed them of his own error  and the place  where he had left me  when the news arrived of my being seized  and  detained until the Count might declare his pleasure  Not the flashing  lightning when it has broken in upon a forest of our stately oaks  ever  raised a more sudden and violent conflagration  than these accounts  kindled in the minds of the brave soldiers of Les Roches  It was at  once resolved for ever to abandon the service of a tyrannical and  revengeful Lord  and to rescue me from his oppressive power  But their  Chief wisely laboured to temper and allay the violence which
