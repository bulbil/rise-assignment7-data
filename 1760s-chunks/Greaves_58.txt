this trance he was waked by the arrival of his squire  who entered the room with the blood trickling over his nose  and stood before him without speaking  When the knight asked whose livery was that he wore  he replied    T is your honour s own livery  I received it on your account  and hope as you will quit the score   Then he proceeded to inform his master  that two officers of the army having come into the kitchen  insisted upon having for their supper the victuals which Sir Launcelot had bespoke  and that he  the squire  objecting to the proposal  one of them had seized the poker  and basted him with his own blood  that when he told them he belonged to a knight errant  and threatened them with the vengeance of his master  they cursed and abused him  calling him Sancho Panza  and such dog s names  and bade him tell his master  Don Quicksot  that  if he made any noise  they would confine him to his cage  and lie with his mistress  Dulcinea   To be sure  sir   said he   they thought you as great a nincompoop as your squire trimtram  like master  like man  but I hope as how you will give them a Rowland for their Oliver     Miscreant   cried the knight   you have provoked the gentlemen with your impertinence  and they have chastised you as you deserve  I tell thee  Crabshaw  they have saved me the trouble of punishing thee with my own hands  and well it is for thee  sinner as thou art  that they themselves have performed the office  for  had they complained to me of thy insolence and rusticity  by Heaven  I would have made thee an example to all the impudent squires upon the face of the earth  Hence  then  avaunt  caitiff  let his majesty s officers  who perhaps are fatigued with hard duty in the service of their country  comfort themselves with the supper which was intended for me  and leave me undisturbed to my own meditations    Timothy did not require a repetition of this command  which he forthwith obeyed  growling within himself  that thenceforward he should let every cuckold wear his own horns  but he could not help entertaining some doubts with respect to the courage of his master  who  he supposed  was one of those hectors who have their fighting days  but are not at all times equally prepared for the combat   The knight having taken a slight repast  retired to his repose  and had for some time enjoyed a very agreeable slumber  when he was startled by a knocking at his chamber door   I beg your honour s pardon   said the landlady   but there are two uncivil persons in the kitchen who have well nigh turned my whole house topsy turvy  Not content with laying violent hands on your honour s supper  they want to be rude to two young ladies who are just arrived  and have called for a post chaise to go on  They are afraid to open their chamber door to get out  and the young lawyer is like to be murdered for taking the ladies  part    Sir Launcelot  though he refused to take notice of the insult which had been offered to himself  no sooner heard of the distress of the ladies than he started up  huddled on his clothes  and girding his sword to his loins  advanced with a deliberate pace to the kitchen  where he perceived Thomas Clarke warmly engaged in altercation with a couple of young men dressed in regimentals  who  with a peculiar air of arrogance and ferocity  treated him with great insolence and contempt  Tom was endeavouring to persuade them  that  in the constitution of England  the military was always subservient to the civil power  and that their behaviour to a couple of helpless young women was not only unbecoming gentlemen  but expressly contrary to the law  inasmuch as they might be sued for an assault on an action of damages   To this remonstrance the two heroes in red replied by a volley of dreadful oaths  intermingled with threats  which put the lawyer in some pain for his ears   While one thus endeavoured to intimidate honest Tom Clarke  the other thundered at the door of the apartment to which the ladies had retired  demanding admittance  but received no other answer than a loud shriek  Our adventurer advancing to this uncivil champion  accosted him thus  in a grave and solemn tone   Assuredly I could not have believed  except upon the evidence of my own senses  that persons who have the appearance of gentlemen  and bear his majesty s honourable commission in the army  could behave so wide of the decorum due to society  of a proper respect to the laws  of that humanity which we owe to our fellow creatures  and that delicate regard for the fair sex which ought to prevail in the breast of every gentleman  and which in particular dignifies the character of a soldier  To whom shall that weaker  though more amiable part of the creation  fly for protection  if they are insulted and outraged by those whose more immediate duty it is to afford them
