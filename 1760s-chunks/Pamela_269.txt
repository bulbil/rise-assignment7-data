     He put his hand before her mouth  Be silent  said he  once more  I   charge you  You know not the innocence you abuse so freely  I ought not    neither will I bear it       She sat down and fanned herself  and burst into tears  and such sobs   of grief  or rather passion  that grieved me to hear  and I sat and   trembled sadly       He walked about the room in great anger  and at last said  Let me ask   you  Lady Davers  why I am thus insolently to be called to account   by you  Am I not independent  Am I not of age  Am I not at liberty to   please myself   Would to God  that  instead of a woman  and my sister    any man breathing had dared  whatever were his relation under that of   a father  to give himself half the airs you have done   Why did you not   send on this accursed errand your lord  who could write me such a letter   as no gentleman should write  nor any gentleman tamely receive  He   should have seen the difference       We all know  said she  that  since your Italian duel  you have commenced   a bravo  and all your airs breathe as strongly of the manslayer as of   the libertine  This  said he  I will bear  for I have no reason to   be ashamed of that duel  nor the cause of it  since it was to save a   friend  and because it is levelled at myself only  but suffer not your   tongue to take too great a liberty with my Pamela       She interrupted him in a violent burst of passion  If I bear this  said   she  I can bear any thing   O the little strumpet   He interrupted her   then  and said wrathfully  Begone  rageful woman  begone this moment   from my presence  Leave my house this instant   I renounce you  and   all relation to you  and never more let me see your face  or call me   brother  And took her by the hand to lead her out  She laid hold of the   curtains of the window  and said  I will not go  You shall not force me   from you thus ignominiously in the wretch s hearing  and suffer her to   triumph over me in your barbarous treatment of me       Not considering any thing  I ran out of the closet  and threw myself at   my dear master s feet  as he held her hand  in order to lead her out    and I said  Dearest sir  let me beg  that no act of unkindness  for my   sake  pass between so worthy and so near relations  Dear  dear madam    said I  and clasped her knees  pardon and excuse the unhappy cause of   all this evil  on my knees I beg your ladyship to receive me to your   grace and favour  and you shall find me incapable of any triumph but in   your ladyship s goodness to me       Creature  said she  art thou to beg an excuse for me   Art thou to   implore my forgiveness  Is it to thee I am to owe the favour  that I   am not cast headlong from my brother s presence  Begone to thy corner    wench  begone  I say  lest thy paramour kill me for trampling thee under   my foot       Rise  my dear Pamela  said my master  rise  dear life of my life  and   expose not so much worthiness to the ungrateful scorn of so violent a   spirit  And so he led me to my closet again  and there I sat and wept       Her woman came up  just as he had led me to my closet  and was returning   to her lady  and she very humbly said  Excuse my intrusion  good sir   I   hope I may come to my lady  Yes  Mrs  Worden  said he  you may come in    and pray take your lady down stairs with you  for fear I should too much   forget what belongs either to my sister or myself       I began to think  seeing her ladyship so outrageous with her brother    what a happy escape I had had the day before  though hardly enough used   in conscience too  as I thought       Her woman begged her ladyship to walk down  and she said  Beck  seest   thou that bed  That was the bed that I was born in  and yet that was the   bed thou sawest  as well
