Latin alphabet 〉  and his 〈 in non Latin alphabet 〉   But waving these digressions  the pleasure which the Cuboy felt from the application of the Dairo s toe nail    38 was succeeded by a kind of tension or stiffness  which began to grow troublesome just as he reached his own palace  where the Bonzas were assembled to offer up their diurnal incense  Instinct  on this occasion  performed what could hardly have been expected from the most extraordinary talents  At sight of a grizzled heard belonging to one of those venerable doctors  he was struck with the idea of a powerful assuager  and taking him into his cabinet  proposed that he should make oral application to the part affected  The proposal was embraced without hesitation  and the effect even transcended the hope of the Cuboy  The osculation itself was soft  warm  emollient  and comfortable  but when the nervous papillae were gently stroaked  and as it were fondled by the long  elastic  peristaltic  abstersive fibres that composed this reverend verriculum  such a delectable titillation ensued  that Fika ka was quite in raptures      39 That which he intended at first for a medicine he now converted into an article of luxury  All the Bonzas who enrolled themselves in the number of his dependants  whether old or young  black or fair  rough or smooth  were enjoined every day to perform this additional and posterior rite of worship  so productive of delight to the Cuboy  that he was every morning impatient to receive the Dairo s calcitration  or rather his pedestrian digitation  after which he flew with all the eagerness of desire to the subsequent part of his entertainment   The transports thus produced seemed to disarrange his whole nervous system  and produce an odd kind of revolution in his fancy  for tho  he was naturally grave  and indeed overwhelmed with constitutional hebetude  he became  in consequence of this periodical tickling  the most giddy  pert buffoon in nature  All was grinning     40 giggling  laughing  and prating  except when his fears intervened  then he started and stared  and cursed and prayed by turns  There was but one barber in the whole empire that would undertake to shave him  so ticklish and unsteady he was under the hands of the operator  He could not fit above one minute in the same attitude  or on the same seat  but shifted about from couch to chair  from chair to stool  from stool to close stool  with incessant rotation  and all the time gave audience to those who sollicited his favour and protection  To all and several he promised his best offices  and confirmed these promises with oaths and protestations  One he shook by the hand  another he hugged  a third he kissed on both sides the face  with a fourth he whispered  a fifth he honoured with a familiar horse laugh  He never had courage to refuse even that which he could not possibly    41 grant  and at last his tongue actually forgot how to pronounce the negative particle  but as in the English language two nagatives amount to an affirmative  five hundred affirmatives in the mouth of Fika kaka did not altogether destroy the efficacy of simple negation  A promise five hundred times repeated  and at every repetition confirmed by oath  barely amounted to a computable chance of performance   It must be allowed  however  he promoted a great number of Bonzas  and in this promotion he manifested an uncommon taste  They were preferred according to the colour of their beards  He found  by experience  that beards of different colours yielded him different degrees of pleasure in the friction we have described above  and the provision he made for each was in proportion to the satisfaction the candidate could afford  The sensation ensuing from the contact of a    42 grey beard was soft and delicate  and agreeably demulcent  when the parts were unusually inflamed  a red  yellow  or brindled beard  was in request when the business was to thrill or tingle  but a black beard was of all others the most honoured by Fika kaka  not only on account of its fleecy feel  equally spirited and balsamic  but also for another philosophical reason  which I shall now explain  You know  Peacock  that black colour absorbs the rays of light  and detains them as it were in a repository  Thus a black beard  like the back of a black cat  becomes a phosphorus in the dark  and emits sparkles upon friction  You must know  that one of the gravest doctors of the Bonzas  who had a private request to make  desired an audience of Fika kaka in his closet at night  and the taper falling down by accident  at that very instant when his beard was in contact with the Cuboy s    43 seat of honour  the electrical snap was heard  and the part illuminated  to the astonishment of the spectators  who looked upon it as a prelude to the apotheosis of Fika kaka  Being made acquainted with this phaenomenon  the minister was exceedingly elevated in his own mind  He rejoiced in it as a communication of some divine efficacy  and raised the happy Bonza to the rank of Pontifex Maximus  or chief priest  in
