the age   will  when finished  be a masterpiece in its kind  and do honour to  human genius and skill  So I say again and again  and I care not  though your friend Playtor heard me  that you have no more taste than a  drayman s horse  and that those foolish notions of the ancients ought to  be drubbed out of you with a pod cudgel  that you might learn to treat  men of parts with more veneration  Perhaps you may not always be in the  company of one who will halloo for assistance when you are on the brink  of being chastised for your insolence  as I did  when you brought upon  yourself the resentment of that Scot  who  by the Lord  would have paid  you both scot and lot  as Falstaff says  if the French officer had not  put him in arrest    The physician  to this declamation  which was conveyed through the  key hole  answered  that he  the painter  was a fellow so infinitely  below his consideration  that his conscience upbraided him with no  action of his life  except that of choosing such a wretch for his  companion and fellow traveller  That he had viewed his character through  the medium of good nature and compassion  which had prompted him to give  Pallet an opportunity of acquiring some new ideas under his immediate  instruction  but he had abused his goodness and condescension in such a  flagrant manner  that he was now determined to discard him entirely  from his acquaintance  and desired him  for the present  to take himself  away  on pain of being kicked for his presumption   Pallet was too much incensed to be intimidated by this threat  which he  retorted with great virulence  defying him to come forth  that it might  appear which of them was best skilled in that pedestrian exercise  which  he immediately began to practise against the door with such thundering  application  as reached the ears of Pickle and his governor  who coming  out into the passage  and seeing him thus employed  asked if he had  forgot the chamber pots of Alost  that he ventured to behave in such a  manner as entitled him to a second prescription of the same nature   The doctor  understanding that there was company at hand  opened the  door in a twinkling  and  springing upon his antagonist like a tiger  a  fierce contention would have ensued  to the infinite satisfaction of  our hero  had not Jolter  to the manifest peril of his own person   interposed  and partly by force  and partly by exhortations  put a stop  to the engagement before it was fairly begun  After having demonstrated  the indecency of such a vulgar rencontre  betwixt two fellow citizens  in a foreign land  he begged to know the cause of their dissension   and offered his good offices towards an accommodation  Peregrine also   seeing the fray was finished  expressed himself to the same purpose   and the painter  for obvious reasons  declining an explanation  his  antagonist told the youth what a mortifying interruption he had suffered  by the impertinent intrusion of Pallet  and gave him a detail of the  particulars of his vision  as above recited  The arbiter owned the  provocation was not to be endured  and decreed that the offender should  make some atonement for his transgression  Upon which the painter  observed  that  however he might have been disposed to make  acknowledgments  if the physician had signified his displeasure like  a gentleman  the complainant had now forfeited all claim to any such  concessions  by the vulgar manner in which he had reviled him and his  productions  observing  that  if he  the painter  had been inclined to  retort his slanderous insinuations  the republican s own works would    6 22 15  3 45 PM   have afforded ample subject for his ridicule and censure   After divers disputes and representations  peace was at length  concluded  on condition  that  for the future  the doctor should never  mention Cleopatra  unless he could say something in her praise  and that  Pallet  in consideration of his having been the first aggressor  should  make a sketch of the physician s vision  to be engraved and prefixed to  the next edition of his odes   CHAPTER LXII   The Travellers depart for Antwerp  at which place the Painter gives a  loose to his Enthusiasm   Our adventurer  baffled in all his efforts to retrieve his lost  Amanda  yielded at length to the remonstrances of his governor and  fellow travellers  who  out of pure complaisance to him  had exceeded  their intended stay by six days at least  and a couple of post chaises   with three riding horses  being hired  they departed from Brussels in  the morning  dined at Mechlin  and arrived about eight in the evening  at the venerable city of Antwerp  During this day s journey Pallet was  elevated to an uncommon flow of spirits  with the prospect of seeing the  birthplace of Rubens  for whom
