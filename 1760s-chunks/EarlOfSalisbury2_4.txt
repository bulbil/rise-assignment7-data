to his  instances  and retired  Grey repaired without  delay to the apartment of Lord Raymond  and appeared before him with a  face of joy and satisfaction  He congratulated him upon the prospect of  a speedy and final accomplishment of his wishes  he briefly related the  conduct of his brother at the monastery  his reception of Oswald  and  the means already taken to prevent that traytor from officiously  spreading his tale  he declared his purpose of seeking him instantly in  his retirement  and was fully assured  he said  that by the assistance  of the Monk   whose zeal and vigilance he praised  he should be able to  bring Oswald to that punishment which his falsehood merited  and to gain  young William into his absolute disposal  the sure means of prevailing  over the pride of Ela  and engaging her to a full compliance with his  wishes  Raymond wondered  but Grey repeated his confident assurances of  success  and departed with requesting his Lord patiently to wait the  events  which the succeeding day must produce     It was now night  but fraud and interested malice are strangers to rest   The Monk was wholly engaged by the thoughts of future favour and  preferment  and Grey watched  like the great enemy of mankind  to  ensnare the innocent  and to seduce the weak  He busily revolved in his  mind the late transactions  and his future designs  He thought of an  expedient which Reignhald had mentioned  that of forcibly joining the  hands of Raymond and the Countess  and pronouncing the nuptial blessing  without regard to her consent  an expedient which he now considered not  as the suggestion of rashness and unexperienced heat  but such as the  best guided policy might have recourse to  and such as their designs  might necessarily require  In the mean time  he resolved  if possible   to reserve the disposal of young William to himself  and even to secrete  him from Lord Raymond s power  If this Lord should prove successful  he  might forget the services of his creature  or not reward them to the  full extent of his wishes  The possession of this boy might hereafter  enable him to revenge such neglect  by unexpectedly producing  a young heir to assert his rights  or if the Countess should be relieved  from her present oppression  and her suitor recalled  or forced from  her castle  the important service of restoring her son might atone for  his former insolence  and shield him from punishment  or should it be  necessary for his purposes to destroy this child  this might be done  more securely in some place of private retirement  and more acceptably  to his Lord  when executed without his knowledge or participation  His  own interest was the sole object of his thoughts  and as to the means of  advancing it  to him  all were equally indifferent     The dawn of morning stole upon him  while he was anxiously engaged in  these reflections  and Reginhald now stood before him  urging him to  pursue his intended course without further delay  He first summoned some  chosen vassals of Raymond  and  in the name of that Lord  ordered them  to follow his steps at some distance  and to hold themselves ready to  obey his orders  The brothers then took their way  and soon reached the  monastery  Here they found  that  notwithstanding the directions of  Reginhald  the Lord Abbot had been made acquainted with the arrival of  Oswald  had examined him in person  had heard  and was duely affected by  his story  promised him protection  and that he would assist in all  honest means of gaining redress for the injured Countess  and that at  this very time he was shut up in the apartment of Oswald  hearing   examining  and enquiring still more minutely into the circumstances of  all those events which he related with so much confidence  and with  such appearance of integrity  The brothers congratulated each other on  arriving so opportunely  and  at their desire were conducted into the  same apartment  Oswald started and trembled at the sight of Grey  who   with a demeanour grave and solemn  and with well affected humility   addressed himself to the Abbot in the following manner         Reverend father  This humane attention to the appearance of distress  will be rewarded  and heaven forefend but that it should meet the just  return of praise  from every honest tongue  nor is there less honour due to your pious and  charitable cares  because  in the present case  they are not called  forth by real danger or calamity  You have entertained a fugitive  already pardoned by his Lord  and an infant whom his fond mother is at  this moment impatient to embrace â€”You wonder  but  vouchsafe me a  favourable ear  I shall unsold what seems so strange and perplexing   This venerable brotherhood must have heard how the royal savour hath  been extended to Lord Raymond  hath invested him with all the power and  dignity of the house of Salibury
