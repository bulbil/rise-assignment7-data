I knew it would so much contribute to her peace of mind   My mother accosted her with saying  Miss Burchell  I have something to tell you  that I believe will give you pleasure  The unhappy young woman lifted up her melancholy eyes  and  shaking    her head  answered  That  I believe  Madam  is now impossible  Your aunt is married  said my mother  but not to Mr Faulkland  and  what is more  there has never any thing passed between them that need be a bar to you  if he could be brought to consider you as he ought  Miss Burchell looked amazed  then turned her eyes from my mother to me  as if for an explanation  My mother desired me to acquaint her with the history at large of Mr Faulkland’s proceedings  I did so  and took care not to omit the tender manner in which he had mentioned her in one of his letters  She dropped some tears at the recital  and then  turning to my mother  My dear good Madam  you have snatched me from despair by this discovery  I was overwhelmed  I think I could not have got the better of my grief  a faint ray of glimmering hope is once more let in upon me  Mr Faulkland may yet be mine without a crime  or  if he is not  I shall at least have the satisfaction to think him not so abandoned as he appeared to me an hour ago  Oh  worthy and lovely Mrs Arnold  said she  addressing herself to me  you see how Mr Faulkland reveres you  oh  that you would but engage in my behalf  you can influence his heart  you can guide his reason  you are his fate   Her fine eyes  which she fixed on me  filled with persuasive eloquence  let me into the whole of her meaning  and conveyed more to me than it was in the power of words to do  I understand you  dear Madam  said I  and it grieves my heart to think that I cannot  must not interest myself for you in the manner I would most ardently undertake to do  if there were not such obstacles in my way as it is impossible for me to get over  Mr Faulkland  you see  is free from the guilt we all feared he had plunged himself into  he is full of remorse for the injury he did you  and I dare believe retains in his heart a tender sense of your merit  he is still free  nay  he has declared his intention of continuing so  These circumstances give large room for hope  your unobjectionable conduct  joined to paternal affection  may still bring about that wished for  happy event  but this must be left to time  and the workings of his own heart  You know Mr Faulkland is  in his natural temper  impatient of restraint  he is but a very young man  and has a few of those levities which a little more settled age infallibly will correct  where a good heart and a good understanding are united  Pardon me if I add  that Mr Faulkland is not ungenerous  however blameable he may have been in regard to you  All these circumstances considered  I say  may warrant your indulging a hope  that he will at last be brought to make you the reparation  which is    mine and my mother’s wish as much as your own  Ah  Madam  said she  but Mr Faulkland is a great way from me  the remembrance of me is already but too much worn out  distance  time  and a variety of objects  must intirely efface it  Your hand  the powerful magic of your touch  would soon brighten up the colouring of those faint  faded traces  that he but scarcely preserves of me in his memory  What could not your pen  guided by a heart so tender  so sympathizing with the grief of others  effect on the man who considers you as a divinity  If he had any hopes of you  Madam  it would be presumption in me to put in my claim  but  as you cannot be my rival  be my advocate  do  dear angelic lady   and she lifted up her hands to me fervently  write to Mr Faulkland  if you can restore him to me  what prayers will I not pour out for your happiness   My mother  who was greatly affected by her discourse  said to me  Indeed  my dear  if you could effect that  it would be a very meritorious work  Who knows what the high opinion Mr Faulkland has of you  and the great deference he pays to your judgment  may produce   I was sorry my good mother’s openness of heart had made her enter so suddenly into Miss Burchell’s sentiments  it encouraged her to renew her intreaties  she snatched both my mother’s hands  and kissed them  she wanted words to thank her   I was unwilling to appear cold in Miss Burchell’s interest  or to refuse doing what my mother seemed to approve  but the resolution I had long before made  never to see  or on any account whatsoever to hold the least correspondence with
