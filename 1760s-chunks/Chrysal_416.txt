      I believe you must be mistaken  sir    interposed the exciseman      the people you mean are lying quietly in the next bed  and seem   to be as much frighted as you are hurt          How     returned my master    did they not lie in the bed next   the door           No    answered the other    Mrs Margery lies here  as grave and   â€¢demure as a whore at a christening          Then the jade of a chambermaid played me a trick    replied   my master    But who the devil lay with her   For I am sure she   was never able to do what I have suffered          As for that     said the actor  who had all the while been peeping   round the bed    I believe it will be no hard matter to find it out    These breeches    pulling a pair from under tlie bolster    must   belong to somebody  and will certainly point out her bed fellow  if   the lady  like a true Amazon  did not wear them herself            CHAPTER LXI     THE ADVANTAGE OF A READY ASSTJEANCE â€” THE METHODIST ACCOITNTS   CUKIOTJSLY FOB WHAT HE HAS DONE   AND TUBNING THE TABLES   UPON CHBYSAL S master  CHABQES HTM WITH BOBBBEY  WHO IS   THEBEUPON OBLIGED TO DISCOVER HIMSELF  BUT IS CONTEADICTED   BY ONE OF THE COMPANY  WHO BOASTS OF A CUEIOUS ACQUAINT    ANCE VnTU HIM IN HIS OWN CHARACTER â€” HE IS LUCKILY RECOG    NIZED BY A FOOTMAN  WHOSE MASTER EXTRICATES HIM FROM HIS   DISTRESS  AND MAKES OUT THE MISTAKES THAT HAD CAUSED   SO MUCH CONFUSION     As the breeches were immediately known to belong to the Methodist    they marched away directly to his bedside  for he had not joined   them  and asked him how he had come to use the gentleman in that   inhuman manner  showing him my master  whom they had dragged   along with them        Who   I     answered the Methodist  affecting all the surprise   of innocence  and determined to deny what he thought could   not be proved    Heaven forbid that I should use any fellow    christian ill  I engage not in such broils  My warfare is with the   spirit          And sometimes with the flesh  too  I believe  doctor     inter          504 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     rupted the actor    Nay  it is in vain to deny it   Do you know   these breeches  doctor           Breeches     exclaimed he  starting up in real affright and   fumbling under his bolster    Oh  they are gone   they are gone     I am robbed  ruined  and undone           No  doctor  they are not gone  as you see   but the question is    how they came under the young woman s bed s head  where this   gentleman received this abuse          Let him answer that     replied the Methodist  never at a loss   for an impudent lie    Let him answer that   all I know of the   matter is this  being disturbed in my rest  I then knew not  but now   plainly perceive by what cause  I arose to pray  as is my custom    when hearing somebody go softly out of the room  I watched  as   was my duty  to prevent any ovil  and following the footsteps into   another chamber  caught a man in the very fact of attempting   the virtue of some female  who lay there   upon which  expostulat    ing with him upon the heinousness of such a crime  he fiew at me   so furiously that I could scarce defend myself from him  and if   in the fray he received any hurt  he must charge it to himself  as   he was the aggressor   but this is not the whole  I now perceive   that I was disturbed out of my sleep by his stealing my breeches   from under my head  which he accordingly took with him into the   room of that damsel  and therefore I demand justice against him   for the attempt  as well as for any loss I may have suffered    Saying   this  he took his breeches out
