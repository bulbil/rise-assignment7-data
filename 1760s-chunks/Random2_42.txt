regard to her  who had no manner of connexion with the fellow  I laid hold of this opportunity to display my valour  and offered to call him to account for his insolence  which she absolutely refused  under pretence of consulting my safety  though I could perceive by the sparkling of her eyes  that she would not have thought herself affronted in being the subject of a duel  I was by no means pleased with this discovery of her thoughts  which not only argued the most unjustifiable vanity  but likewise the most barbarous indifference  however  I was allured by her fortune  and resolved to gratify her pride  in making her the occasion of a publick quarrel between me and Bragwell  who  I was pretty certain  would never drive matters to a dangerous extremity   While we danced together  I observed this formidable rival at one end of the room  encircled with a cluster of beaus  to whom he talked with great vehemence  casting many big looks at me  from time to time  I guessed the   119 subject of his discourse  and as soon as I had handed my partner to her seat  strutted up to the place where he stood  and cocking my hat in his face  demanded aloud  if he had any thing to say to me  He answered with a fullen tone     Nothing  at present  Sir    and turned about upon his heel —   Well   said I  you know where I am to be found at any time  —  His companions stared at one another  and I returned to the lady  whose features brightened at my approach  and immediately a whisper run thro  the whole room  after which  so many eyes were turned upon me  that I was ready to sink with confusion —When the ball broke up  I led her to her coach  and  like a true French gallant  would have got up behind it  in order to protect her from violence on the road  but she absolutely refused my offer  and expressed her concern that there was not an empty seat for me within it     Next day in the afternoon I waited on her at her lodgings  by permission  in company with Chatter  and was very civilly received by her mother  with whom she lived —there were a good many fashionable people present  chiefly young fellows  and immediately after tea a couple of card tables were set  at one of which I had the honour to play with Melinda  who in less than three hours made shift to plunder me of eight guineas —I was well enough content to lose a little money with a good grace  that I might have an opportunity to say soft things in the mean time  which are still most welcome  when attended with good luck  but I was by no means satisfied with her fair play  a circumstance that shocked me not a little  and greatly impaired my   120 opinion of her disinterestedness and delicacy —However  I was resolved to profit by this behaviour  and treat her in my turn with less ceremony  accordingly  I laid close siege to her  and finding her not at all disgusted with the gross incense I offered  that very night made a declaration of love in plain terms —She received my addresses with great gaity  and pretended to laugh them off  but at the same time treated me with such particular complacency  that I was persuaded I had made a conquest of her heart  and concluded myself the happiest man alive —Elevated with these flattering ideas  I sat down again to cards  after supper  and with great chearfulness suffered myself to be cheated of ten guineas more   It was late before I took my leave  after being favoured with a general invitation  and when I got into bed  the adventures of the day hindered me from sleeping —Sometimes I pleased myself with the hopes of possessing a fine woman with ten thousand pounds  then I would ruminate on the character I had heard of her from Banter  and compare it with the circumstances of her conduct towards me  which seemed to bear too great a resemblance to the picture he had drawn —This introduced a melancholy reflection on the expence I had undergone  and the smallness of my funds to support it  which  by the bye  were none of my own —In short  I found myself involved in doubts and perplexities  that kept me awake the greatest part of the night   In the morning  Strap  with whom I had not conversed these two days  presented himself with the utensils for shaving me  upon which  I asked his opinion of the lady whom he had seen me   121 conduct to her coach at Hampstead —   Odd  she s a delicious creature  cried he  and  as I am informed  a great fortune —I am sorry you did not insist on going home with her —I dare say  she would not have refused your company  for she seems to be a good humoured soul  —   There s a time for all things  said I   You must know  Strap  I was in company with her till one o clock this morning  —  I had no sooner
