played our hero such a slippery trick after the electioneering adventure    I perceive   said he   you are preparing to expostulate  and upbraid me for having given a false information against you to the country justice  I look upon mankind to be in a state of nature  a truth  which Hobbes has stumbled upon by accident  I think every man has a right to avail himself of his talents  even at the expense of his fellow creatures  just as we see the fish  and other animals of the creation  devouring one another  I found the justice but one degree removed from idiotism  and knowing that he would commit some blunder in the execution of his office  which would lay him at your mercy  I contrived to make his folly the instrument of my escape—I was dismissed without being obliged to sign the information I had given  and you took ample vengeance for his tyranny and impertinence  I came to London  where my circumstances obliged me to live in disguise  In the character of a conjurer  I was consulted by your follower  Crowe  and your squire  Crabshaw  I did little or nothing but echo back the intelligence they brought me  except prognosticating that Crabshaw would be hanged  a prediction to which I found myself so irresistibly impelled  that I am persuaded it was the real effect of inspiration  I am now arrested for a paltry sum of money  and  moreover  liable to be sent to Bridewell as an impostor  let those answer for my conduct whose cruelty and insolence have driven me to the necessity of using such subterfuges  I have been oppressed and persecuted by the government for speaking truth  your omnipotent laws have reconciled contradictions  That which is acknowledged to be truth in fact  is construed falsehood in law  and great reason we have to boast of a constitution founded on the basis of absurdity  But  waiving these remarks  I own I am unwilling to be either imprisoned for debt  or punished for imposture  I know how far to depend upon generosity  and what is called benevolence—words to amuse the weak minded  I build upon a surer bottom  I will bargain for your assistance  It is in my power to put twelve thousand pounds in the pocket of Samuel Crowe  that there sea ruffian  who  by his goodwill  would hang me to the yard s arm ——  There he was interrupted by the seaman   D—n your rat s eyes  none of your—hang thee  fish my top masts  if the rope was fairly reeved  and the tackle sound  d ye see —Mr  Clarke  who was present  began to stare  while the knight assured Ferret  that if he was really able and willing to serve Captain Crowe in anything essential  he should be amply rewarded  In the meantime he discharged the debt  and assigned him an apartment in his own house  That same day Crowe  by the advice of Sir Launcelot and his nephew  entered into conditional articles with the cynic  to allow him the interest of fifteen hundred pounds for life  provided by this means the captain should obtain possession of the estate of Hobby Hole in Yorkshire  which had belonged to his grandfather  and of which he was heir of blood   This bond being executed  Mr  Ferret discovered that he himself was the lawful husband of Bridget Maple  aunt to Samuel Crowe  by a clandestine marriage  which  however  he convinced them he could prove by undeniable evidence  This being the case  she  the said Bridget Maple  alias Ferret  was a covert femme  consequently could not transact any deed of alienation without his concurrence  ergo  the docking of the entail of the estate of Hobby Hole was illegal and of none effect  This was a very agreeable declaration to the whole company  who did not fail to congratulate Captain Crowe on the prospect of his being restored to his inheritance  Tom Clarke  in particular  protested  with tears in his eyes  that it gave him unspeakable joy  and his tears trickled the faster  when Crowe  with an arch look  signified  that now he was pretty well victualled for life  he had some thoughts of embarking on the voyage of matrimony   But that point of happiness to which  as the north pole  the course of these adventures hath been invariably directed  was still unattained  we mean  the indissoluble union of the accomplished Sir Launcelot Greaves and the enchanting Miss Darnel  Our hero now discovered in his mistress a thousand charms  which hitherto he had no opportunity to contemplate  He found her beauty excelled by her good sense  and her virtue superior to both  He found her untainted by that giddiness  vanity  and affectation  which distinguish the fashionable females of the present age  He found her uninfected by the rage for diversion and dissipation  for noise  tumult  gewgaws  glitter  and extravagance  He found her not only raised by understanding and taste far above the amusement of little vulgar minds  but even exalted by uncommon genius and refined reflection  so as to relish the more sublime enjoyments of rational pleasure  He found her possessed of that vigour of mind which constitutes true fortitude  and vindicates the empire of reason  He
