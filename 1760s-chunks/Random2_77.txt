Transported at the news of my happiness  I presented my ring to the messenger  as a testimony of my gratitude and satisfaction  but she was above such mercenary considerations  and refused my compliment with some resentment  saying  she was not a little mortified to see my opinion of her so low and contemptible —I did myself a piece of justice by explaining my behaviour on this head  and to convince her of my esteem  promised to be ruled by her directions in the prosecution of the whole affair  which I had so much at heart  that the repose of my life depended upon the consequence   As I fervently wished for another interview  where I might pour out the effusions of my love  without danger of being interrupted  and perhaps reap some endearing return from the queen of my desires  I implored her advice and assistance in promoting this event —but she gave me to understand  that Narcissa would make no precipitate compliances of this kind  and that I would do well to cultivate her brother s acquaintance  in the course of which  I would not want opportunities of removing that reserve  which my mistress thought herself obliged to maintain during the infancy of our correspondence —In the mean time  she promised to tell her lady that I had endeavoured by presents and persuasions  to prevail upon her   Miss Williams  to deliver a letter from me  which she had refused to charge herself with  until she should know Narcissa s sentiments of the matter  and said  by these means she did not doubt of being able to open a literary communication between us  which could not fail of introducing more intimate connexions     228 I approved of her counsel  and our appointment being renewed for next day  left her with an intent of falling upon some method of being reconciled to the Squire  who  I supposed  would be offended with the trick we had put upon him —With this view  I consulted Freeman  who from his knowledge of the Fox hunter s disposition  assured me there was no other method of pacifying him  than that of sacrificing ourselves for one night  to an equal match with him in drinking  This I found myself necessitated to comply with  for the interest of my passion  and therefore determined to commit the debauch at my own lodgings  that I might run no risk of being discovered by Narcissa  in a state of brutal degeneracy —Mr  Freeman  who was to be of the party  went  at my desire  to the Squire in order to engage him  while I took care to furnish myself for his reception —My invitation was accepted  my guests honoured me with their company in the evening  when Bruin gave me to understand that he had drank many tuns of wine in his life  but was never served such a trick as I had played upon him the night before  I promised to atone for my trespass  and having ordered to every man his bottle  began the contest with a bumper to the health of Narcissa —The toasts circulated with great devotion  the liquor began to operate  our mirth grew noisy  and as Freeman and I had the advantage of drinking small French claret  the savage was effectually tamed before our senses were in the least affected  and carried home in a kind of apoplexy of drunkenness   I was next morning  as usual  savoured with a visit from my kind and punctual confidante  who   229 telling me  she was permitted to receive my letters for her mistress  I took up the pen immediately  and following the first dictates of my passion  wrote as follows   DEAR  MADAM   WERE it possible for the powers of utterance  to reveal the soft emotions of my soul  the fond anxiety  the glowing hopes  and chilling fears that rule my breast by turns  I should need no other witness than this paper  to evince the purity and ardour of that flame your charms have kindled in my heart  But alas  expression wrongs my love  I am inspired with conceptions that no language can convey  Your beauty fills me with wonder  your understanding with ravishment  and your goodness with adoration  I am transported with desire  distracted with doubts  and tortured with impatience  Suffer me then  lovely arbitress of my fate  to approach you in person  to breathe in soft murmurs my passion to your car  to offer the sacrifice of a heart overflowing with the most genuine and disinterested love  to gaze with exstasy on the divine object of my wishes  to hear the musick of her enchanting tongue  to rejoice in her smiles of approbation  and banish the most intolerable suspence from the bosom of  Your enraptured R— R—     230 Having finished this effusion  I committed it to the care of my faithful friend  with an injunction to second my intreaty with all her eloquence and influence  and in the mean time went to dress  with an intention of visiting Mrs  Snapper and Miss  whom I had utterly neglected and indeed almost forgot  since my dear Narcissa had resumed the empire of my soul  The old gentlewoman received me very kindly  and Miss affected a frankness and gaiety  which  however  I could easily perceive was forced and dissembled
