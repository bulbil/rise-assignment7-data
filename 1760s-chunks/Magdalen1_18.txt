hold of her hand  I raised it coldly to my lips  and again begged she would moderate a passion  which was wholly founded on mistake —   This excess of sensibility my dear Miss Mildmay observed I  is an equal injustice to my sentiments and your own understanding    107 —The exception which you have so unfortunately taken to my behaviour this morning  is rather the result of an extraordinary delicacy on your part  than the consequence of any impropriety on mine—You say I am desirous of discontinuing my addresses  and that you are conscious of being lessened in my esteem—How cruel  how inequitable a supposition  when I am here impatiently waiting for the happy day which is to unite us for ever  and ready this instant  if you really doubt my sincerity to anticipate the wishes of the two families by a marriage that shall silence your fears  till I am publicly honoured with your hand in the presence of all our relations—Tell me  is there any greater proof which I can possibly give you  either of my love or my esteem  if there is  be kind enough to name it  for be assured I only want to know   108 your inclinations  that I may fly to indulge them     Though there was nothing extremely passionate in this address  Melmoth  nevertheless  had I delivered it with any energy of tone or significance of gesture  it might perhaps  have removed Louisa s anxiety at once  and all might have been immediately accommodated between us  but as I spoke it with inconceiveable phlegm  and kept my eye continually wandering round the room  it was impossible for her  without a manifest deviation from her natural dignity to accept it as an apology  whether she really saw into my true motive or not  I shall not attempt to determine  but raising up her head  and regarding me for some time with a look of the most earnest attention  she assumed a steady articulate tone of voice  and delivered herself to the following purport     109The more Sir Robert that I consider the nature of your behaviour  the more I am convinced how utterly improper it is for you and I ever to think of uniting —The recent unhappy transaction has destroyed me entirely in your good opinion  and indeed no wonder  for it has entirely destroyed me in my own  I see that as a man of fashionable honour  you are ready to fulfil your engagements with me  but by the manner in which you testify this readiness  I also see that you secretly wish I should discharge you from that obligation—You want to provoke me into such an exertion of my pride  as must force me to reject you  and only desire to save appearances by drawing that refusal from me which must otherwise absolutely proceed from yourself—It would however  be much more generous if you candidly acknowledged the   110 real motives of your behaviour  and since you have fortitude enough to bear up against the pain of a separation  I could wish you had spirit enough to avow the design  this method of making me answerable for the consequences of your own infidelity  is no less unmanly than it is unjust  but it is below me to upbraid you—for any claim which I shall make upon your inclinations—be satisfied  that if you are willing to be free  you are so   As she paused in this place  I was about to make a reply—but she stopped me in the beginning of my speech  and said    Sir Robert  professions are idle things when contradicted by the incontestible evidence of facts —You have made me miserable  and you have made me worthless  do not therefore by the display of an affected tenderness   111 seek to load me with an additional portion  either of wretchedness or disgrace—I am not altogether the simpleton you take me for  your motives I saw through from the moment you spoke upon this subject—and though you have shewn but little consideration for me  during the course of our debate  I shall nevertheless spare you a world of confusion and anxiety—In short  Sir  without puting you to the trouble of any farther arts to break off the treaty between us—I again assure you in the most solemn manner  that it never shall take place—And  unhappy as I shall freely own this resolution must for some time make me  I nevertheless think it not a little fortunate that I discovered your sentiments before the intended ceremony  by preventing the possibility a of separation   had fastened me to   112 a more lasting  as well as to a more aggravated distress     Here Melmoth  was the end of our altercation  Louisa  on finishing this speech rose hastily from her chair  and darting up to her room  as I suppose  left me to chew the cud of my own reflections  which to speak honestly my dear Charles  was none of the most agreeable—However  though I was secretly pleased that she had by a very generous effort of soul spared me the mortification of being more than passive in the course of this transaction  you cannot think how it affected both my pride and my tenderness  to see her so apparently easy upon such a trying occasion—I imagined it would cost her something more to give me up for ever  and to the disgrace of my
