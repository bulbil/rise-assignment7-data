was now reduced to fifteen hundred fit for service —The sick and wounded were squeezed into certain vessels  which thence obtained the name of hospital ships  though methinks they scarce deserved such a creditable title  seeing none of them could boast of either surgeon  nurse or cook  and the space between decks was so confined  that the miserable patients had not room to sit upright in their beds  Their wounds and stumps being neglected  contracted filth and putrefaction  and millions of maggots were hatched amid the corruption of their sores  This inhuman disregard was imputed to the scarcity of surgeons  though it is well known  that every great ship in the fleet could have spared one at least for this duty  which would have been more than sufficient to remove this shocking inconvenience  But  perhaps  the general was too much of a gentleman to ask a favour of this kind from his fellow chief  who on the other hand  would not derogate so far from his own dignity  as to offer such assistance unasked  for I may venture to affirm  that by this time  the Daemon of discord with her sooty wings  had breathed her influence upon our counsels  and it might be said of these great men    294  I hope they will pardon the comparison  as of Caesar and Pompey  the one could not brook a superior  and the other was impatient of an equal  So that between the pride of one  and insolence of another  the enterprize miscarried  according to the proverb     Between two stools the backside falls to the ground  —  Not that I would be thought to liken any publick concern to that opprobrious part of the human body  although I might with truth assert  if I durst use such a vulgar idiom  that the nation did hang an a—se at its disappointment on this occasion  neither would I presume to compare the capacity of our heroic leaders to any such wooden convenience as a joint stool or a close stool  but only signify by this simile  the mistake the people committed in trusting to the union of two instruments that were never joined     A day or two after the attempt on St  Lazar  the admiral ordered one of the Spanish men of war we had taken  to be mounted with sixteen guns  and manned with detachments from our great ships  in order to batter the town  accordingly  she was towed into the inner harbour in the night time  and moored within half a mile of the walls  against which she began to fire at daybreak  and continued about four hours exposed to the opposition of at least forty pieces of cannon  which at length obliged our men to set her on fire  and get off as well as they could  in their boats —This piece of conduct afforded matter of speculation to all the wits  either in the army or the navy  who were at last fain to acknowledge it a stroke of policy above their comprehension —Some entertained such an irreverent   295 opinion of the admiral s understanding  as to think he expected the town would surrender to his floating battery of sixteen guns  Others imagined his sole intention was to try the enemy s strength  by which he would be able to compute the number of great ships that would be necessary to bring the Spaniards to a capitulation  But this last conjecture soon appeared groundless  in as much as no ships of any kind whatever were afterwards employed on that service —A third sort swore  that no other cause could be assigned for this undertaking  than that which induced Don Quixote to attack the windmill  A fourth class  and that the most numerous  though without doubt  composed of the sanguine and malicious  plainly taxed this commander with want of honesty as well as sense  and alledged that he ought to have sacrificed private pique to the interest of his country  that where the lives of so many brave fellow citizens were concerned  he ought to have concurred with the general  without being sollicited or even desired  towards their preservation and advantage  that if his arguments could not dissuade him from a desperate enterprize  it was his duty to render it as practicable as possible  without running extreme hazard  that this could have been done  with a good prospect of success  by ordering five or six large ships to batter the town while the land forces stormed the castle  by this means  a considerable diversion would have been made in favour of those troops  who in their march to the assault and in the retreat  suffered much more from the town than from the castle  that the inhabitants seeing themselves vigorously attacked on   296 all hands  would have been divided  distracted and confused  and in all probability  unable to resist the assailants —But all these suggestions surely proceed from ignorance and malevolence  or else the admiral would not have found it such an easy matter  at his return to England  to justify his conduct to a ministry at once so upright and discerning —True it is  that those who undertook to vindicate him on the spot  asserted  there was not water enough for our great ships near the town  tho  this was a little unfortunately urged  because there happened to be pilots in the fleet
