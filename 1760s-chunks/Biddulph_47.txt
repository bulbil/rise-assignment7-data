of his tenderness  and am determined to go   October 31  Once more returned to London in very good spirits  after a stay of little more than two months in Essex  in which time so material and unexpected a change has been made in my condition   Lady Grimston took a most affectionate leave of my mother and asked her  with more tenderness than I thought her capable of  How many ages would it be before they should meet again  As for Mr Arnold and me  she considers us her neighbours  The Dean pleases himself with that expectation too  and the dear Mrs Vere  who shed tears at bidding me adieu  promises herself the happiness  as she kindly expressed herself  of spending many delightful days with me next summer  She set out on her return to her own house  at the same time that we left ours to go to town   My brother is still in Wiltshire  but I find he did not leave town at the time he mentioned in his letter to my mother  nor for some days after  This Patty learnt from the servants  but I hope it will not come to my mother’s ears  for she would take it extremely ill of him   Mr Arnold  for the first time  mentioned  that he was very much disappointed in not having had the honour of seeing Sir George at his house in the country  but he hoped  when he came to town  his brother and he should make up for this  by being the more together  I wish Sir George may behave as he ought to this deserving brother  Mr Arnold little imagines how much he was an enemy to this match  and much less his reason for it  I should be very sorry Mr Arnold were to know how near I was being married to another man  it might give a delicate mind pain  lest there should remain any traces of this former attachment in the breast of the woman he loves  but I hope there is no danger of his hearing of it  certainly no one would be so indiscreet as to mention it to him  Mr Arnold has lived chiefly in the country  and may never have heard of Mr Faulkland  as he was so short a time returned from his travels  on which he had been absent more than five years  and as he is now out of the kingdom  probably he will not be spoken of  I have begged of my mother  who is naturally    communicative  never to name Mr Faulkland to Mr Arnold  and have given my reasons for desiring this  She says  she thinks it would be better to tell him the whole affair at once  but I cannot agree with her in that opinion  and have at last prevailed on her to promise me she will not speak of it   November 2  My mother drove out in my new chariot to day  a very gay fine one it is   and went to Putney  to enquire after Miss B  by the name of Mrs Jefferis  She soon found the house  a very neat box  with a pretty garden behind it  The door was opened by a servant maid  and my mother being told the lady was at home  sent in her name  and was immediately conducted up stairs into a very elegant little dressing room  where the lady was sitting at her toilet  and Mr Faulkland’s housekeeper  whom my mother had seen before  assisting to dress her head  On my mother’s entering the room  Miss B  rose off her chair  and soon discovered by her shape  for she was without her stays   that it was high time for her to seek a place of concealment  The housekeeper immediately withdrew  and the young lady seemed in the utmost confusion  my mother says  she herself was at a loss how to begin the conversation  but Miss B  relieved her  and spoke first  She thanked her for the honour she did her by so charitable a visit  which  she said  Mr Faulkland had long ago made her hope for  and which she must consider as the greatest consolation in her present unhappy circumstances   My mother placed herself by her  Madam  said she  Mr Faulkland made it a point with me before he left England  that I should see you  and afford you all the assistance in my power  or that you should stand in need of  You seem to be commodiously situated here  and I understand have a very careful good woman to attend you   I have so  madam  she answered  but the most material circumstance is wanting to my relief  Mr Faulkland —He is not here  Tears started into her eyes as she spoke  You were apprised of his absence  said my mother  before you came to town  I was  madam  and with the cause of it  she hung down her head and was silent   My mother reassumed the conversation  She told her  she thought it a most providential discovery  that had given her the knowlege of Mr Faulkland’s ill behaviour  time enough to prevent his marriage with her daughter  assuring her  she would not  for the universe  have had me the
