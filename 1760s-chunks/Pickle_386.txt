constables of the court  who took him and his adherent  prisoners  before they were aware  and delivered them into the hands of  the turnkeys  by whom they were immediately dismissed  and their baggage  conveyed to the side of the ditch   This expulsion was not performed without an obstinate opposition on the  part of the delinquents  who  had they not been surprised  would have  set the whole Fleet at defiance  and  in all probability  have acted  divers tragedies  before they could have been overpowered  Things  being circumstanced as they were  the lieutenant did not part with his  conductor without tweaking his nose  by way of farewell  and Pipes   in imitation of such a laudable example  communicated a token of  remembrance  in an application to the sole eye of his attendant  who   scorning to be outdone in this kind of courtesy  returned the compliment  with such good will  that Tom s organ performed the office of a  multiplying glass  These were mutual hints for stripping  and   accordingly  each was naked from the waist upwards in a trice  A ring  of butchers from the market was immediately formed  a couple of the  reverend flamens  who  in morning gowns  ply for marriages in that  quarter of the town  constituted themselves seconds and umpires of the  approaching contest  and the battle began without further preparation   The combatants were  in point of strength and agility  pretty equally  matched  but the jailor had been regularly trained in the art of  bruising  he had more than once signalized himself in public  by his  prowess and skill in this exercise  and lost one eye upon the stage in  the course of his exploits  This was a misfortune of which Pipes did not  fail to take the advantage  He had already sustained several hard knocks    6 22 15  3 45 PM   upon his temples and jaws  and found it impracticable to smite his  antagonist upon the victualling office  so dexterously was it defended  against assault  He then changed his battery  and being ambidexter   raised such a clatter upon the turnkey s blind side  that this hero   believing him left handed  converted his attention that way  and opposed  the unenlightened side of his face to the right hand of Pipes  which  being thus unprovided against  slyly bestowed upon him a peg under the  fifth rib  that in an instant laid him senseless on the pavement  at  the feet of his conqueror  Pipes was congratulated upon his victory   not only by his friend Hatchway  but also by all the by standers   particularly the priest who had espoused his cause  and now invited the  strangers to his lodgings in a neighbouring alehouse  where they were  entertained so much to their liking  that they determined to seek  no other habitation while they should continue in town  and   notwithstanding the disgrace and discouragement they had met with  in  their endeavours to serve our adventurer  they were still resolved to  persevere in their good offices  or  in the vulgar phrase  to see him  out   While they settled themselves in this manner  and acquired familiar  connections round all the purlieus of the ditch  Peregrine found himself  deprived of the company of Cadwallader  who signified  by letter  that  he did not choose to hazard his person again in visiting him  while such  assassins occupied the avenues through which he must pass  for he had  been at pains to inquire into the motions of the seamen  and informed  himself exactly of the harbour in which they were moored   Our hero had been so much accustomed to the conversation of Crabtree   which was altogether suitable to the singularity of his own disposition   that he could very ill afford to be debarred of it at this juncture   when almost every other source of enjoyment was stopped  He was   however  obliged to submit to the hardships of his situation  and as the  characters of his fellow prisoners did not at all improve upon him  he  was compelled to seek for satisfaction within himself  Not but that he  had an opportunity of conversing with some people who neither wanted  sense  nor were deficient in point of principle  yet there appeared in  the behaviour of them all  without exception  a certain want of decorum   a squalor of sentiment  a sort of jailish cast contracted in the course  of confinement  which disgusted the delicacy of our hero s observation   He  therefore  detached himself from their parties as much as he could   without giving offence to those among whom he was obliged to live  and  resumed his labours with incredible eagerness and perseverance  his  spirits being supported by the success of some severe philippics  which  he occasionally published against the author of his misfortune   Nor was his humanity unemployed in the vacations of his revenge  A man  must be void of all sympathy and compassion  who can reside among so  many miserable objects  without feeling an inclination to relieve their  distress
