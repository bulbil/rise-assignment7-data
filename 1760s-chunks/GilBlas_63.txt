a mere catalogue of common occurrences  Nevertheless  since we have nothing else to do  I will run over the narrative  such as it is  At the same time he entered on the recital nearly in the following terms       CH  VII     The journeyman barber s story   I TAKE up my tale from the origin of things  My grandfather  Ferdinand Perez de la Fuenta  barber general to the village of Olmédo for fifty years  died  leaving four sons  The eldest  Nicholas  succeeded to the shop  and lathered himself into the good graces of the customers  Bertrand  the next  having taken a fancy to trade  set up for a mercer  and Thomas  who was the third  turned schoolmaster  As for the fourth  by name Pedro  feeling within himself the high destinies of learning  he sold a dirty acre or two which fell to his share  and went to settle at Madrid  where he hoped one day to distinguish himself by his genius and erudition  The other three brothers would not part  they fixed their quarters at Olmédo  marrying peasants  daughters  who brought their husbands very little dowry  except an annual present of a chopping young rustic  They had a most public spirited emulation in child bearing  My mother  the barber s wife  favoured the world with a contribution of six within the first five years of her marriage  I was among the number  My father initiated me betimes in the mysteries of shaving  and when he saw me grown up to the age of fifteen  laid this wallet across my shoulders  presented me with a long sword  and said    Go  Diego  you are now qualified to gain your own livelihood  go and travel about  You want a little acquaintance with the world to give you a polish  and improve you in your art  Off with you  and do not return to Olmédo till you have made the tour of Spain  nor let me hear of you till that is accomplished  Finishing with this injunction  he embraced me with fatherly affection  and shoved me out of doors by the shoulders   Such were the parting benedictions of my sire  As for my mother  who had more the touch of nature in her manners  she seemed to feel somewhat at my departure  She dropped a few tears  and even slipped a ducat by stealth into my hand   Thus was I sent from Olmédo into the wide world  and took the road of Segovia  I did not go two hundred yards without stopping to examine my bag  I had a mind to view its contents  and to know the precise amount of my possessions  There I found a case with two razors  which must have travelled post over the chins of ten generations  by the evidence of their wear and tear  with a strap to set them  and a bit of soap  In addition to this  a coarse shirt quite new  a pair of my father s shoes quite old  and what rejoiced me more than all the rest  a rouleau of twenty rials in a linen bag  Behold the sum total of my personals  You may conclude master Nicholas  the barber  to have reckoned a good deal on my ingenuity  by his turning me adrift with so slender a provision  Yet a ducat and twenty rials  by way of fortune  was enough to turn the head of a young man unaccustomed to money concerns  I fancied my stock of cash inexhaustible  and pursued my journey in the sun shine of brilliant anticipation  looking from time to time at the hilt of my rapier  while the blade was striking against the calf of my leg at every step  or tripping up my heels   In the evening I reached the village of Ataquinés with a very catholic stomach  I put up at the inn  and  as if I meant to spend freely  asked  in a lofty tone  what there was for supper  The landlord examined my pretensions with his eye  and finding according to what cloth my coat was cut  said with true publican s civility    Yes  yes  my worthy master  you shall have no reason to complain  we will treat you like a lord  With this assurance  he showed me into a little room  whither he brought me  a quarter of an hour afterwards  a ragout made of a great he cat  on which I feasted with as famous an appetite as if it had been hare or rabbit  This excellent dish was washed down by so choice a wine  that the king had no better in his cellars  I found out  however  that it was pricked  but that was no hindrance to my doing it as much honour as the he cat  The last article in this entertainment for a lord was a bed better adapted to drive sleep away than to invite it  Figure it to yourself about the width of a coffin  and so short that I could not stretch my legs  though none of the longest  Besides  there was neither mattress nor feather bed  but merely a little straw sewed up in a sheet folded double  which was laid
