 and many s the good pound we have lost by them  but what of that  Sure we know how to behave to our betters  Mr  Gobble  thanks be to God  can defy the whole world to prove that he ever said an uncivil word  or did a rude thing to a gentleman  knowing him to be a person of fortune  Indeed  as to your poor gentry and riffraff  your tag rag and bob tail  or such vulgar scoundrelly people  he has always behaved like a magistrate  and treated them with the rigger of authority  — In other words   said the knight   he has tyrannised over the poor  and connived at the vices of the rich  Your husband is little obliged to you for this confession  woman  — Woman   cried Mrs  Gobble  impurpled with wrath  and fixing her hands on her sides by way of defiance   I scorn your words —Marry come up  woman  quotha  no more a woman than your worship   Then bursting into tears   Husband   continued she   if you had the soul of a louse  you would not suffer me to be abused at this rate  you would not sit still on the bench  and hear your spouse called such contemptible epitaphs —Who cares for his title and his knightship  You and I  husband  knew a tailor that was made a knight  but thank God  I have noblemen to stand by me with their privileges and beroguetifs    At this instant Mr  Fillet returned with his friend  a practitioner in the law  who freely offered to join in bailing our adventurer  and the other two prisoners  for any sum that should be required  The justice perceiving the affair began to grow more and more serious  declared that he would discharge the warrants and dismiss the prisoners   Here Mr  Clarke interposing  observed  that against the knight no warrant had been granted  nor any information sworn to  consequently  as the justice had not complied with the form of proceeding directed by statute  the imprisonment was coram non judice  void   Right  sir   said the other lawyer   if a justice commits a felon for trial without binding over the prosecutor to the assizes  he shall be fined  — And again   cried Clarke   if a justice issues a warrant for commitment  where there is no accusation  action will lie against the justice    Moreover   replied the stranger   if a justice of peace is guilty of any misdemeanour in his office  information lies against him in Banco Regis  where he shall be punished by fine and imprisonment   And  besides   resumed the accurate Tom   the same court will grant an information against a justice of peace  on motion  for sending even a servant to the house of correction or common jail without sufficient cause  — True   exclaimed the other limb of the law   and  for contempt of the law  attachment may be had against justices of peace in Banco Regis  A justice of the peace was fined a thousand marks for corrupt practices    With these words  advancing to Mr  Clarke  he shook him by the hand  with the appellation of brother  saying   I doubt the justice has got into a cursed hovel   Mr  Gobble himself seemed to be of the same opinion  He changed colour several times during the remarks which the lawyers had made  and now  declaring that the gentlemen were at liberty  begged  in the most humble phrase  that the company would eat a bit of mutton with him  and after dinner the affair might be amicably compromised   To this proposal our adventurer replied  in a grave and resolute tone   If your acting in the commission as a justice of the peace concerned my own particular only  perhaps I should waive any further inquiry  and resent your insolence no other way but by silent contempt  If I thought the errors of your administration proceeded from a good intention  defeated by want of understanding  I should pity your ignorance  and  in compassion  advise you to desist from acting a part for which you are so ill qualified  but the preposterous conduct of such a man deeply affects the interest of the community  especially that part of it  which  from its helpless situation  is the more entitled to your protection and assistance  I am  moreover  convinced that your misconduct is not so much the consequence of an uninformed head  as the poisonous issue of a malignant heart  devoid of humanity  inflamed with pride  and rankling with revenge  The common prison of this little town is filled with the miserable objects of your cruelty and oppression  Instead of protecting the helpless  restraining the hands of violence  preserving the public tranquillity  and acting as a father to the poor  according to the intent and meaning of that institution of which you are an unworthy member  you have distressed the widow and the orphan  given a loose to all the insolence of office  embroiled your neighbours by fomenting suits and animosities  and played the tyrant among the indigent and forlorn  You have abused the
