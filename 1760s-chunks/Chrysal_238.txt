granted for this reason  and away I resolutely went  in company   with the officers  to execute it  We found my landlord  in the   security of innocence in his parlour  waiting for my coming in to   dinner  It is impossible to express his astonishment when they laid   hold of him like a thief  and told him it was on my accusation  All   the resolution and presence of mind I was master of were requisite   to bear me through the scene  At first he was unable to speak a   word  which the candour of his accusers did not fail to construe   into a silent acknowledgment of his guilt   but  recovering himself   in a few moments  he first raised his eyes to heaven  and then    turm ng them upon me  gave me a look that almost froze the blood   in my veins  but never deigned to speak a word to me  He then   addressed himself to the officers  and mildly desired that they would   execute their duty with lenity  nor offer any indignity to the sacred   character he bore  till a proof of his guilt should make him appear   unworthy of the sanction of it  Such behaviour had an effect not   to be described upon all that were present  The very officers forgot   their hardened nature for a moment  and the tear of pity fell from   eyes that never wept before at human misery  Even I began to   feel the foolish infection  and was obliged to charm up other passions   to prevent my betraying myself  though my ruin was at stake    Accordingly  I raised my voice  and  with a stern accent  commanded   the officers to do their duty  and search the house before hjs accom    plices should have time to convey away the things we came in quest   of  This word put an end to a compassion that was contrary to   their nature  and they proceeded to their business with their usual   keermess  though still with respect  till they came to search his         274 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     closet  where the sight of things which I had sworn to have been   stolen from me appeared so plain a proof of hia guilt  that they   treated him with all the indignity of the vilest malefactor        Secure in his innocence  he had hitherto preserved a steadiness   of temper that seemed superior to the power of fortune   but at   this sight his resolution failed him  He fell upon his knees  and   raising his hands and eyes to heaven â€”   Just God    said he      Thy will be done  Thou knowest my innocence  and art able to   defend me  and wilt defend me    said he  rising  and recovering his   former spirits        In the meantime  I seemed encouraged by this success  to hope   for the recovery of the money which I pretended to have lost also    and ceased not to urge the officers to make the strictest search    But this was not necessary   they ransacked every place  and tossed   about everything that was too large for them to convey away  till   they made his whole house one scene of desolation  They then   dragged him before the magistrate  where the finding of the things   gave such weight to the charge which I positively swore against   him  that he was on the verge of being hurried to prison  and would   certainly have suffered an ignominious death  had it not been for   some unlucky prevarication in my valet de charribre s evidence    This  with some suspicions that were suggested against my own   character by the pawnbroker to whom I had sold the goods I took   up from my tradesmen  and who unfortunately happened to be   present  gave the affair such a turn in his favour  that he was ad    mitted to bail  till his innocence or guilt should be proved by a   public trial  But it was far from my intention to wait for this    The moment I left the magistrate  I went to the house of an ac    quaintance  whither I had ordered my effects to be removed before    where I resolved to prepare for my departure with the utmost   expedition  As to my creditors  when they called upon me next   morning  as I had appointed  for their money  I told them the story   of my having been robbed the day before by my landlord  and   therefore that they must wait till I should receive another remittance   from my own country   and though I saw that few of them believed   me  or were inclined to grant me that indulgence  I was imder   no concern  as
