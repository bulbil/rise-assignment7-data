the Latter   You must surely have lost all Sense of either  when you could think so meanly of me  as you seem to do  in your last Letter  Have you forgot  with what Satisfaction I received that Proof of your Confidence  which you would now withdraw  You tell me  I shall hear no more of it  but let me tell you  if I do not  you shall never hear the Last of it  for I have fancied more Joy    14 in embracing that dear little Adoption than ever you received in the Arms of it s Mother  I have not  Thanks to Providence  yet reduced myself to such an abject State  as to have Reason to be jealous of your Amours  nor do I heed    If  here or there  his Glances flew   Oh  free  for ever  be his Eye   Whose Heart to me is always true     Frances   LETTER X  HENRY to FRANCES   THE Account you give me of Miss — s Rivalship is very entertaining  but I return you the Letter  because you seem to apprehend I should make an improper Use of it   When she said that  Beauty is Vanity   her Moral was certainly very good  but she betrays  at the same Time  that Ugliness is   Vexation of Spirit     To be rendered an Object of Love is the Gift of Nature  and very few are indowed with such a Blessing  but I think Providence has put it out of the Power of fewer still to make themselves esteemed  —But Emulation  not Jealousy  must work this happy Effect     15Beauty is at best but a flowery Triumph  and that Person must have a very poor Ambition  who does not struggle for the longest and surest Empire  Adieu   Henry   LETTER XI   Dear FANNY   I DID not receive your Letter according to the Date of it  and the Delay must have happened with you  for I was at the Post Office when your Letter came in last Night   Your Account of Miss — s Week s Route of Diversions made me laugh  but I was actually out of Breath  by the Time I had got to Saturday Night  such a Passion for Shews and publick Places is natural to young People  but there are many ridiculous Persons in the World  who hurry thro  Life  after the same Rate  up to their grand Climacterick  and  in short  the generality of Mankind seem rather to have a Stomach  than a Taste for Pleasure    Call it Diversion and the Pill goes down   Which is entirely owing to the abrupt Entrance into the World  which young People are too soon indulged in  and makes them continue Children all the Days of their Lives  as I have   16 observed  that if you broach a Vessel of Liquor  before it has purged off it s Crudities  it will still drink new  tho  you keep it on Draught never so long  I wish all the Children of our Kingdom  were made Children of the Publick  as was the Method of some antient States  but then without such antient States Men my Wish is absurd  as Horace s proposing to fly from Rome  as an Expedient against the Corruption of the People s Morals  as if the Vice was rather in the Stones of the Street than in the Manners of the Citizens  He  who would reform publick Politicks  must first reclaim private Morals  and I agree rather with Plato  who founds his Commonwealth on the Basis of Virtue  than with Harrington  who affirms the Body politick to be a Machine     Adieu   LETTER XII   Dear SPRIGHTLY   I RECEIVED your Ballad  and read it to a large Company of Wit and Taste  with proper Stops and Emphases  It was extremely liked  and Copies begged  which I refused  according to your Commands  It really is in the true Ballad Stile  and has a very pretty Turn of Poetry in it     17I read Cowley s Translation  or rather Imitation of Anacreon s first Ode  which you sent me  and am better pleased with my own  than I was before  for it is closer to the Original  is short  and has no affected Turn in it  but what is in the Original   My reasons for with holding  not refusing as you call it  my Friendship at present are these which follow   I forget whether it is your favourite Rochefaulcaut  or La Bruyere  who says    there may be an Affection between Persons of different Sexes  without any farther Desire or Thought  but as they certainly regard each other  as of different Genders  this cannot be called pure Love  or pure Friendship  but is a mixed Affection of a third Sort   Now  my dear Fanny  since our Friendship cannot be pure  let us stick to that Passion  which may be so  and is  in effect  but a warmer and more intimate Friendship  Your only Reason  for preferring Platonics must be  that you imagine they may last longer than
