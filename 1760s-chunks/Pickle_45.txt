 being in danger from the number of his foes  called to  his wife to let loose the dog  which instantly flew to his master s  assistance  and  after having torn the leg of one and the shoulder  of another  put the whole body of scholars to flight  Enraged at the  indignity which had been offered them  they solicited a reinforcement  of their friends  and  with Tom Pipes at their head  marched back to  the field of battle  Their adversary  seeing them approach  called  his apprentice  who worked at the other end of the ground  to his  assistance  armed him with a mattock  while he himself wielded a hoe   bolted his door on the inside  and  flanked with his man and mastiff   waited the attack without flinching   He had not remained three minutes in this posture of defence  when  Pipes  who acted as the enemy s forlorn hope  advanced to the gate with  great intrepidity  and  clapping his foot to the door  which was none of  the stoutest  with the execution and despatch of a petard  split it into  a thousand pieces  This sudden execution had an immediate effect upon  the apprentice  who retreated with great precipitation  and escaped at  a postern  but the master placed himself  like another Hercules  in  the breach  and when Pipes  brandishing his cudgel  stepped forward to  engage him  leveled his weapon with such force and dexterity at his  head  that had the skull been made of penetrable stuff  the iron edge    6 22 15  3 45 PM   must have cleft his pate in twain  Casemated as he was  the instrument  cut sheer even to the bone  on which it struck with such amazing  violence  that sparks of real fire were produced by the collision   And let not the incredulous reader pretend to doubt the truth of this  phenomenon  until he shall have first perused the ingenious Peter  Kolben s Natural History of the Cape of Good Hope  where the inhabitants  commonly used to strike fire with the shin bones of lions which had been  killed in that part of Africa   Pipes  though a little disconcerted  far from being disabled by the  blow  in a trice retorted the compliment with his truncheon  which  had  not his antagonist expeditiously slipped his head aside  would have  laid him breathless across his own threshold  but  happily for him  he  received the salutation upon his right shoulder  which crashed beneath  the stroke  and the hoe dropped instantly from his tingling hand  Tom   perceiving  and being unwilling to forego  the advantage he had gained   darted his head into the bosom of this son of earth  and overturned him  on the plain  being himself that instant assaulted by the mastiff  who  fastened upon the outside of his thigh  Feeling himself incommoded by  this assailant in his rear  he quitted the prostrate gardener to the  resentment of his associates  who poured upon him in shoals  and turning  about  laid hold with both his hands of this ferocious animal s throat   which he squeezed with such incredible force and perseverance  that the  creature quitted his hold  his tongue lolled out of his jaws  the blood  started from his eyes  and he swung a lifeless trunk between the hands  of his vanquisher   It was well for his master that he did not longer exist  for by this  time he was overwhelmed by such a multitude of foes  that his whole body  scarce afforded points of contact to all the fists that drummed upon  him  consequently  to use a vulgar phrase  his wind was almost knocked  out  before Pipes had leisure to interpose in his he behalf  and  persuade his offenders to desist  by representing that the wife had  gone to alarm the neighbourhood  and in all probability they would  be intercepted in their return  They accordingly listened to his  remonstrances  and marched homewards in triumph  leaving the gardener  in the embraces of his mother earth  from which he had not power to move  when he was found by his disconsolate helpmate and some friends whom  she had assembled for his assistance  Among these was a blacksmith and  farrier  who took cognizance of his carcase  every limb of which having  examined  he declared there was no bone broken  and taking out his  fleam  blooded him plentifully as he lay  He was then conveyed to his  bed  from which he was not able to stir during a whole month  His family  coming upon the parish  a formal complaint was made to the master of  the school  and Peregrine represented as the ringleader of those who  committed this barbarous assault  An inquiry was immediately set on  foot  and the articles of impeachment being fully proved  our hero was  sentenced to be severely chastised in the face of the whole school  This  was a disgrace  the thoughts of which his proud heart could not brook   He resolved to make his elopement rather than undergo the
