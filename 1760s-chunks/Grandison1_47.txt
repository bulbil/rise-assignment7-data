as a woman is more an husband s than a man is a wife s  Have all the men this prerogative notion  Lucy  You know it is a better man s  I shall have a pride worth boasting of  if I can call such a jewel mine  Poor Walden —Rot the fellow —I warrant he would not have so   112 knowing a wife for the world —Ha  ha  ha  hah  He is right  It is certainly right for such narrow pedants to be afraid of learned women —Methinks  I see the fellow  conjurer like  circumscribed in a narrow circle  putting into Greek what was better expressed in English  and forbidding every one s approach within the distance of his wand —Hah  hah  hah —Let me die  if ever I saw a tragi comical fellow better handled —Then the faces he made—Saw you ever  Mr  Reeves  saw you ever in your life such a parcel of disastrous faces made by one man   Thus did Sir Hargrave  laughingly  run on  Nor left he hardly any thing for my cousins to say  or to do  but to laugh with him  and to smile at him   On a message that tea was near ready  I went down  On my entering the room  he addressed me with an air of kindness and freedom  Charming Miss Byron  said he  I hope you are all benignity and compassion  You know not what I have suffered since I had the honour to see you last  bowing very low  then rearing himself up  holding back his head  and seemed the taller for having bowed   Handsome fop  thought I to myself  I took my seat  and endeavoured to look easy and free  as usual  finding something to say to my cousins  and to him  He begged that tea might be postponed for half an hour  and that  before the servants were admitted  I would hear him relate the substance of the conversation that had passed between him and Mr  and Mrs  Reeves   Had not Sir Hargrave intended me an honour  and had he not a very high opinion of the efficacy of eight thousand pounds a year in an address of this kind  I dare say  he would have supposed a little more prefacing necessary  But  after he had told me  in few words  how much he was attracted by my character before he saw me  he thought fit directly to refer himself to the declaration he had made at Lady Betty Williams s    113 both to Mr  Reeves and myself  and then talked of large settlements  boasted of his violent passion  and besought my favour with the utmost earnestness   I would have played a little female trifling upon him  and affected to take his professions only for polite raillery  which men call making love to young women  who perhaps are frequently but too willing to take in earnest what the wretches mean but in jest  but the fervour with which he renewed  as he called it  his declaration  admitted not of sooling  and yet his volubility might have made questionable the sincerity of his declarations  As therefore I could not think of encouraging his addresses  I thought it best to answer him with openness and unreserve   To seem to question the sincerity of such professions as you make  Sir Hargrave  might appear to you as if I wanted to be assured  But be pleased to know that you are directing your discourse to one of the plainesthearted women in England  and you may therefore expect from me nothing but the simplest truth  I thank you  Sir  for your good opinion of me  but I cannot encourage your addresses   You cannot  madam  encourage my addresses  And express yourself so seriously  Good heaven   He stood silent a minute or two  looking upon me  and upon himself  as if he had said  foolish girl  knows she whom she refuses   I have been assured  madam  recovering a little from his surprize  that your affections are not engaged  But surely it must be a mistake  Some happy man—  Is it  interrupted I  a necessary consequence  that the woman who cannot receive the addresses of Sir Hargrave Pollexsen  must be engaged   Why  madam—As to that—I know not what to say—But a man of my fortune  and I hope  not absolutely disagreeable either in person or temper  of some rank in life—He paused  then resuming—What    114 madam  if you are as much in earnest as you seem  can be your objection  Be so good as to name it  that I may know  whether I cannot be so happy as to get over it   We do not  we cannot  all like the same person  Women  I have heard say are very capricious  Perhaps I am so  But there is a something  we cannot always say what  that attracts or disgusts us   Disgusts  madam—Disgusts  Miss Byron   I spoke in general  Sir  I dare say  nineteen women out of twenty would think themselves favoured in the addresses of Sir Hargrave Pollexfen   But you  madam  are the twentieth that I must love
