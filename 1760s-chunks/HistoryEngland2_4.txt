been ordered by fate that nothing was to put the people into good humour  The contest therefore between privilege and prerogative was now carried on with the same acrimony as before  Tonnage and poundage was exacted by the King as a right belonging to the crown  and refused by the merchants as a tax that could only be granted by the people  The parliament was called to determine the dispute  but  instead of discussing that argument  they entered upon disputes about religion  The house was mostly composed of Puritans  and such were for abolishing Episcopacy  and persecuting Papists  They were freed from Buckingham  but there was another favourite whom they dreaded still more  Laud Archbishop of Canterbury  a great favourer of the opinion of Divine right  and firmly attached to the rites of the church as then established  They seemed willing to allow the King no favourite  and therefore loudly murmured against this Bishop  Their indignation  however  was  for a while  called off to another object  which was considered as a new act of violence in the King  His customhouse officers had seized upon the goods of one or two merchants who refused to pay tonnage and poundage  The Judges  in the former reign of James I  had adjudged this tax to belong to the   8 crown without consent of parliament  The former reign therefore had been the proper time for disputing the King s right  but the commons had then not so much power  or such a spirit of resistance as now  They were now perfectly sensible of their own strength  and were resolved to fix the limits between the King and the people  They therefore boldly and warmly remonstrated against the King s proceeding  and he in return imprisoned four of the members  and dissolved the parliament  These were the causes which soon after overturned the state  and laid the throne in blood   I am   c   LETTER II   AMonarchical government has ever been looked upon as best  when wisely administered  We are so constituted by nature that some are born to command  and others to obey  In a republic  how free soever  the people cannot govern themselves  and their leaders must be tyrants over their own narrow circle of subjects  In a monarchy the Governor is placed at a distance from the many  as he is but one  in a republic the tyrants are near  because they are many  In the former the people are subject to oppression from errors of will  in the latter  to be harrassed by the rigours of the law  in a monarchy the redress of grievances is speedy  in a republic  dilatory and uncertain  in the one  punishments are few  in the other  severe and numerous  from the debility of the constitution   The present parliament  seemed not so intent upon abridging the King s power  as upon entirely abolishing it  they were Calvinists  and it is   9 the spirit of Calvinism to throw off the restraints of royalty  The English had lately seen this happily effected in Switzerland and Holland  and  influenced by such examples  seemed desirous of imitation   You have seen the King and the English parliament now almost prepared for an open rupture  still  however  the commons kept within the bounds of humble remonstrance  and  while they refused his Majesty s demands  asked pardon for their delay  They had still a respect for their Monarch  which even their republican principles could not entirely efface  and  though they were willing to wound  yet they feared to strike an open blow  The Scotch soon set them an example of resistance  they had  in that kingdom  long embraced the Calvinistical doctrines  and  though they still had Bishops  these were reduced to poverty  and treated with contempt  James I  attempted to exalt the Bishops  and to introduce the rites and the liturgy of the church of England among them  but died in the midst of his endeavours  Charles  therefore  was resolved to complete what his father had begun  This unnecessary and illjudged attempt alienated the affections of his Scotoh subjects  The sedition past from city to city  the Calvinists formed a league  as if all the laws  divine and human  were infringed  while the desire in the court party of supporting their commands  and  in the people  of defending their religion  soon  excited  actually  in Scotland  those dangers which in England were  as yet  only apprehended   In such a situation the King could only repress the presumption of his Scotch subjects by the assistance of those of England  but he had lately dissolued his parliament  and seemed no way disposed to call another  he had cut off the sources of every supply in cases of emergency  and fondly hoped he   10 could govern by merely the terror of royalty  His favourites helped to confirm his errors  they were fond of arbitrary power  because they shared its indulgences  the privy council considered itself as absolute  the Star Chamber  as it was called  severely punished all who denied the prerogative royal  the High Commission court now turned from defending the Papists against the Puritans  whom they justly feared  as tinctured with the spirit of resistance
