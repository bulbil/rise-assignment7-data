of her   humour and behaviour  he conjured her to reflect on her late adventure   with the impostor  Sir Frederick Fineer  and how ill it became her to   countenance the addresses of a wretch like him  and  at the same time    trifle with a man of fortune and reputation       She suffered him to go on in this manner for a considerable time    without giving him the least interruption  but by degrees recovering her   spirits   I shall take care  Sir   said she   never to fall into the   like adventure again  neither do I intend to trifle with Mr  Munden  but   marriage is a thing of too serious a nature to hurry into  without first   having made trial of the constancy of the man who would be a husband    and also of being well assured of one s own heart        Mr  Thoughtless then told her  with some warmth  that he found she was   relapsing into a humour and way of thinking which could not in the end   but bring ruin on herself and disgrace to all her family  and added    that for his part he should meddle no more in her affairs  The tender   soul of Miss Betsy was deeply affected at these words  she loved her   brothers  and could not bear their displeasure  the thought of having   any disagreement with them was dreadful to her  yet the putting a   constraint on her inclinations to oblige them was no less so  In this   dilemma  whether she complied  or whether she refused  she found herself   equally unhappy       One moment she was opening her mouth to yield a ready assent to all that   was requested of her on the score of Mr  Munden  the next to confess    that she neither liked nor loved that gentleman  and knew not whether   she should ever be able to resolve on a marriage with him  but her   sincerity forbade the one  and her fears of offending gave a check to   the other  and both together kept her entirely silent        You ought  methinks  however   resumed Mr  Thoughtless   to have spared   Mr  Munden the trouble of laying open his circumstances  and me that of   examining into them     I should undoubtedly have done so  Sir     answered she   if I had been entirely averse to the proposals of Mr    Munden  therefore  both you and he are too hasty in judging  You know    brother  that Sir Ralph and my dear Lady Trusty will be in town in a   very few days  and I am willing to have the approbation of as many of my   friends as possible  in a thing of so much consequence to my future   peace        Mr  Thoughtless was now somewhat better satisfied than he had been  and   after recommending to her a constancy of mind and resolution  took his   leave of her       This conversation having a little dissipated those gay imaginations she   was before possessed of  she began to consider seriously what she meant   by all this  and what it availed her to give both her lover and brothers   so much matter of complaint against her  she reflected that she had now   gone so far with that gentleman  that neither honour towards him  nor   regard to her own reputation  would well suffer her to go back   Since   it is so  then   said she to herself   to what end do I take all this   trouble to invent excuses for delaying what must one day necessarily be        Yet  wherefore must it be   continued she   I have made no promise  and   if a better offer should happen  I see no reason that obliges me to   reject it  for example  if Mr  Trueworth or such a one as Mr  Trueworth     if his equal is to be found in nature  neither my brothers  nor the   world  I fancy  would condemn me for quitting Mr  Munden        Why  then   cried she   need I make all this haste to put myself out of   the way of fortune  I am young enough  have lost no part of what has   attracted me so many admirers  and  while my heart and hand are free    have  at least  a chance of being more happy than Mr  Munden can make   me        In a word  being fully persuaded in her mind that the lady  who had   supplanted her in Mr  Trueworth s affections  was dead  she imagined   there was a probability he might renew
