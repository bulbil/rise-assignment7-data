OF THE DOCTOR AND DANCER OF THE ARCHBISHOP 13   DIVERTED BY ANOTHER DREAM     When the rubber was finished  my mistress was asked to out in â€”   â  one of the party being taken suddenly ill â€” which she did  and sat    out the whole evening  her success at cards keeping up her spirits    and giving her hopes of the like in the greater affair she came about    But her patroness had very different fortune  having lost every   rubber  and  what was still worse  several by  bets  which she made   to bring herself home      This put her into such a temper  that the moment the rest of the   company was gone  she turned to my mistress  who saw them all    out â€”   And now  pray  madam  may I ask you what was the great   business that brought you here this evening   said she   Unlucky   business it has been for me  I know  for I have never held a card since   you came  But I shall take care that rascal who let you in shall   never serve me so again  He shall strip  and turn off without his   breakfast  the moment I am up in the morning          Dear madam    rephed my mistress  unabashed at such a salute      have patience a moment  and I hope to make you amends for aU    Will you please to sit doivn to one sober party of piquet   You   are always too hard for me  yet I ll venture all my winnings  and   perhaps what I have to say in the meantime may compensate for   my intrusion        The lady could not imagine what she meant   but the thought   of so good a match brought her a little to her temper  and  though   it was near ten o clock  she sat down to cards with aa much         ADVENTUEES OF A GUINEA 141     keenness as if six hours drudging at them had only whetted her   desire for play      As soon as a repique or two had confirmed her good humour  my   mistress says to her     Dear madam  that is right  Have you heard   of the sad accident that happened this eyening         â€¢ Not I    replied the other    Pray  what was it           Why  poor Dr was taken ill shortly after dinner  and died     in his chair          Ah  then  I suppose he had plum porridge  and over eat himself     and so burst a pudding  as we say to children  Ha   ha   ha     Ha   ha   ha           But pray  madam  have you any faith in dreams 7 What do    you think 7 I dreamed last night that I saw you at court  on some   great occasion  with just such a diamond necklace on as the Coun    tess s  which you had bought with five hundred pounds  that you   won from me on a bet  you laying that my husband would    and I that he would not get the doctor s living  Well  to be sure    there must be something more than ordinary in it  for  can you   believe it 7 this very morning I put a bank note for five hundred   pounds in my pocket  Here it is   though I did not think of the   poor man s death till I heard it as I came by this evening  when   the dream ran so strongly in my head  that I could not forbear   breaking in upon you  a rudeness I never should have been guilty   of upon any other occasion          Dear madam  you need make no apology to me   you know your   company is always welcome   I am always at home to you          But  madam  what do you think of my dream   7       I don t know  I only wish it were to prove true  for five hun    dred pounds could never come more seasonably          Then you must win it  for my heart is set upon making the   bet   and I assure you  I have such a regard for you  that I   do not even wish you to lose  and that is what few gamesters    can say          You are a pleasant
