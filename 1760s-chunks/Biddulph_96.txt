sorry I entertained so false a suspicion  and more so  as it has produced such unhappy consequences  but I hope Mr Faulkland will not believe that I meant him any injury   That I am sure you did not  said I  and yet this very affair has given me more uneasiness than you can imagine  for as Mrs Arnold’s brother is my most particular friend  he must think me the greatest of villains  if I could entertain a thought of dishonouring his family  the fear of losing his friendship  I own  gives me more pain than I can    express  and there is nothing I would not do to exculpate myself to him   I am very unfortunate  cried Mrs Gerrarde  pretending to wipe her eyes   to have been the occasion of so much uneasiness in any body’s family  I wish I had died before I was so unhappy as to meet with Mr Arnold  if it had not been for him  I might now have been an innocent and a contented woman  and she really squeezed out a tear  though not of contrition   Dear madam  again taking her hand   do not afflict yourself for what is past recalling  contentment  nay happiness  I hope  is yet within your reach  it will be your own fault if you do not lay hold of it  as for the unhappy family that I  as well as you  have contributed to distress  I wish from my heart there could be a reunion amongst them  Mr Arnold’s having lost you might perhaps incline him to turn his thoughts towards his wife  if he were not prejudiced against her by the suspicions he has entertained of her virtue  This I am afraid will be an insuperable bar to their ever living together  unless your influence  which first gave birth to his jealousy  is still forcible enough to remove it   I wish it were in my power  said Mrs Gerrarde  there is nothing I would not do to effect it  but what influence can I have on Mr Arnold  after what has happened   Suppose you were to write to him  said I  you and he probably may never meet again  and it would be an effort worthy indeed of a noble mind  to repair the wrongs we have done to others  by a candid acknowlegement of our own faults  Putting Mrs Arnold out of the question  ’tis a reparation you owe my character  for however light the world may make of a piece of gallantry with a married woman  it is a matter of serious moment to me to acquit myself of the supposed crime to Sir George Bidulph   If you think  said she  that my writing to Mr Arnold could produce such good effects  I am ready to do it  though I confess I hardly know how to address him  for he must  to be sure  look upon me as the very reverse of what I really am  and thinks me without dispute an ungrateful woman   We can but try  said I  if it does not produce the desired effect  it will not be your fault  and you will have the satisfaction to reflect  that you have done your duty  I stepped to my escruitore while I was speaking  and resolving not to give her time to cool  took out pen  ink  and paper  and laid them on a little writing table before her  If this    unlucky breach  said I  were once made up  my mind would then be easy   She took the pen in her hand  but seemed irresolute  and at a loss how to begin  Come  madam  said I  and confute  by your own example  the received erroneous opinion  that if a woman once strays from the paths of virtue  she never returns to them   A false and ill grounded opinion indeed  said she  lifting up her prophane eyes as in penitence  What am I to say   You are to observe  that my notes  as she went along while I dictated  are put between hooks    Begin  ‘Dear Sir’  for I would neither be too familiar nor too cold   ‘The terms on which you and I have lived  intitles you to an explanation of my reasons for leaving you so abruptly  and I hope the generosity of my motive will incline you to overlook the seeming unkindness of the action ’  This you may assure yourself it will  when he comes to consider coolly   ‘The unhappiness that I occasioned in your family  by causing the separation of you and your wife  has  for a long time  been a thorn in my heart  and the more so  as besides the robbing her of your affections  I own  and take shame to myself in the confession’  how noble must he think this confession    ‘that those aspersions  which I threw on her  had not the least foundation in truth ’  This is truly great   ‘I always believed her perfectly innocent  but  if I could have had the least possible doubt of it before  I must now be confirmed in that opinion by Mr Faulkland  who can have no reason for
