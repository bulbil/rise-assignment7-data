earl  are perfectly just   the works of   industry are  unquestionably  the works of peace  and tend to open   the avenues wherein the virtues may walk  But how to incite   men or nations to industry  that is the question  The finer arts    we see  may be encouraged and promoted by national bounties  as   now in France   but there is no inciting the bulk of the people to   industry in like manner  that would be as though the public   should grant a bounty to itself  Nations certainly differ from   nations as man differs from man   some are by nature industrious   and ingenious  such as China and Holland it is their propensity    their talent   while others  like Ireland  are naturally lazy and   listless  and therefore remain in well merited indigence          You have greatly mistaken this point indeed  my lord  China   and Holland are industrious and ingenious  because  whether it   were through good hap or good policy  they hit upon the only         352 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      method whereby industry and ingenuity could be duly promoted    Whereas Great Britain and Ireland are totally ignorant of the said   method to this day  though both of them highly capable of having   it put in execution      You surprise me  Mr  Meekly  said the earl   a method to make   men ingenious a method to make them industrious  how can   that be      Experience has proved it to be even so  my lord   for where a   method may be found for encouraging and promoting ingenuity   and industry  that method will  infallibly  make people become both   ingenious and industrious  No man will work  my lord  without   some hire  or wages  or return for his labour   neither will any who   are in want refuse to work  when assured of a due reward for   so doing      When the good householder walked out to the market place  and   found labourers loitering there when it was now toward evening    he asked them    Why stand ye here all the day idle     And when   they answered   Because no man hath hired or given us employ    ment   he took this for a sufficient apology  he had compassion   upon them  and he supplied them with the divinest of all kinds of   charity  the means of earning their own bread      Now  throughout China and Holland  no person is in want    because all are hired  all employed  the young and the old  the   lame and the blind   and all find a ready sale  Avithout anxiety or   loss of time  without travel or delay  for products of their industry    Throughout Great Britain  on the contrary  nineteen in twenty are   in real want   and in Ireland  as I am told  forty nine in fifty are   nearly in a state of beggary  merely for want of being employed   for want of encouragement to labour      Permit me  then  to explain to your lordship  how some men and   some nations come to be encouraged to industry  and others to be   discouraged  or hi a manner prohibited  from it      Different men are endowed with different talents and powers    insufficient in many respects  though superfluous in others  to their   own occasions  Different countries are also endowed with different   productions  superfluous in many respects to the natives  though   necessary or desirable for the well being of foreigners      Now  these alternate qualities of deficience and abundance  at   once invite and impel all men  and all countries  to claim and to   impart that reciprocal assistance which is denominated commerce    Each gives what he can spare  each receives what he wants   the   exchange is to the mutual advantage of all parties  And  could a   method be found out for encouraging manufacturers to persevere   in their industry  and improve in their arts  by a ready conveyance   and sale of all their redundancies  neither want nor superfluity   could find place upon earth      All this is quite clear and self evident  Mr  Meekly   but how to   procure this ready sale is the question      Your Iqrdship must allow that the way to procure it would be   to bring barterers and commuters  buyers and sellers  all who   mutually want and mutually abound  together  For this is the end   and purpose of every market upon earth          TEE FOOL OF QUALITY
