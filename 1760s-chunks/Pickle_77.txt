deal out my happiness in such scanty  portions  Why will you thus mince the declaration which would overwhelm  me with pleasure  and cheer my lonely reflection  while I sigh amid  the solitude of separation   His fair mistress  melted by this image   replied  with the tears gushing from her eyes   I m afraid I shall feel  that separation more severely than you imagine   Transported at this  flattering confession  he pressed her to his breast  and while her head  reclined upon his neck  mingled his tears with hers in great abundance   breathing the most tender vows of eternal fidelity  The gentle heart  of Sophy could not bear this scene unmoved  she wept with sympathy   and encouraged the lovers to resign themselves to the will of fate  and  support their spirits with the hope of meeting again on happier terms   Finally  after mutual promises  exhortations  and endearments  Peregrine  took his leave  his heart being so full that he could scarce pronounce  the word Adieu  and  mounting his horse at the door  set out with Pipes  for the garrison   CHAPTER XXVIII   Peregrine is overtaken by Mr  Gauntlet  with whom he fights a Duel  and  contracts an intimate Friendship  He arrives at the Garrison  and finds  his Mother as implacable as ever  He is insulted by his Brother Gam   whose Preceptor he disciplines with a Horsewhip   In order to expel the melancholy images that took possession of his  fancy  at parting from his mistress  he called in the flattering ideas  of those pleasures he expected to enjoy in France  and before he had  rode ten miles  his imagination was effectually amused  While he thus  prosecuted his travels by anticipation  and indulged himself in all    6 22 15  3 45 PM   the insolence of hope  at the turning of a lane he was all of a sudden  overtaken by Emilia s brother on horseback  who told him he was riding  the same way  and should be glad of his company  This young gentleman   whether prompted by personal pique  or actuated with zeal for the honour  of his family  had followed our hero  with the view of obliging him to  explain the nature of his attachment to his sister   Peregrine returned his compliment with such disdainful civility as gave  him room to believe that he suspected his errand  and therefore  without  further preamble  he declared his business in these words   Mr  Pickle   you have carried on a correspondence with my sister for some time  and  I should be glad to know the nature of it   To this question our lover  replied   Sir  I should be glad to know what title you have to demand  that satisfaction     Sir   answered the other   I demand it in the  capacity of a brother  jealous of his own honour  as well as of his  sister s reputation  and if your intentions are honourable  you will  not refuse it     Sir   said Peregrine   I am not at present disposed to  appeal to your opinion for the rectitude of my intentions  and I think  you assume a little too much importance  in pretending to judge my  conduct     Sir   replied the soldier   I pretend to judge the conduct  of every man who interferes with my concerns  and even to chastise  him  if I think he acts amiss     Chastise   cried the youth  with  indignation in his looks   sure you dare not apply that term to  me     You are mistaken   said Godfrey   I dare do anything that becomes  the character of a gentleman     Gentleman  God wot   replied the other   looking contemptuously at his equipage  which was none of the most  superb   a very pretty gentleman  truly    The soldier s wrath was inflamed by this ironical repetition  the  contempt of which his conscious poverty made him feel  and he called his  antagonist presumptuous boy  insolent upstart  and with other epithets   which Perry retorted with great bitterness  A formal challenge having  passed between them  they alighted at the first inn  and walked into  the next field  in order to decide their quarrel by the sword  Having  pitched upon the spot  helped to pull off each other s boots  and laid  aside their coats and waistcoats  Mr  Gauntlet told his opponent  that  he himself was looked upon in the army as an expert swordsman  and  that if Mr  Pickle had not made that science his particular study  they  should be upon a more equal footing in using pistols  Peregrine was too  much incensed to thank him for his plain dealing  and too confident  of his own skill to relish the other s proposal  which he accordingly  rejected  then  drawing his sword  he observed  that were he to treat  Mr  Gauntlet according to his deserts
