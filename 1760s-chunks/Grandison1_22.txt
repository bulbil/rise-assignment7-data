my reasons—These be they—Down went his cup and sawcer  up went his left hand ready spread  and his crooked finger of his right hand  as ready to enumerate   No doubt  Sir Rowland  you have very good reasons   But  madam  you must hear them—And I shall prove—  I am convinced  Sir Rowland  that twenty four is an age early enough   But I shall prove  madam  that you at twenty  or at twenty one—  Enough  enough  Sir Rowland  What need of proof when one is convinc d   But you know not  madam  what I was driving at—  Well but  Sir Rowland  said Miss Bramber  will not the reasons you could give for the proper age at twenty four  make against your wishes in this case   They will make against them  madam  in general cases  But in this particular case they will make for me  For the Lady before me is—  Not in my opinion  perhaps  Sir Rowland  will your reasons make for you  And then your exception in my favour will signify nothing  And besides  you must know  that I never can accept of any compliment that is made me at the expence of my Sex   Well then  madam  I hope you forbid me in favour to my plea  You are loth to hear any thing for twenty four against twenty one  I hope   That is another point  Sir Rowland   Why  madam  you seem to be afraid of hearing my reasons  No man living knows better than I  how to behave in Ladies company  I believe I should not be so little of a gentleman  as to offend the nicest   50 ear  No need indeed  no need indeed  looking archly  Ladies on certain subjects are very quick   That is to say  Sir Rowland  interrupted Mrs  Reeves  that modesty is easily alarmed   If any thing is said  or implied  upon certain subjects that you would not be thought to understand  Ladies know how to be ignorant  And then he laughed   Undoubtedly  Sir Rowland  said I  such company as this  need not be apprehensive  that a gentleman  like you  should say any thing unsuitable to it  But do you really think affected ignorance can be ever graceful  or a proof of true delicacy  Let me rather say  That a woman of virtue would be wanting to her character  if she had not courage enough to express her resentment of any discourse  that is meant as an insult upon modesty   Admirably said again  But men will sometimes forget  that there are Ladies in company   Very favourably put for the men  Sir Rowland  But pardon me  if I own  that I should have a mean opinion of a man  who allowed himself to talk even to men what a woman might not hear  A pure heart  whether in man or woman  will be always  in every company  on every occasion  pure   Ad s my life  you have excellent notions  madam  I wanted to hear you speak just now  And now you make me  and every one else  silent—Twenty one  why what you say would shame Sixty one  You must have kept excellent company all your life —Mercy  if ever I heard the like from a Lady so young —What a glory do you reflect back upon all who had any hand in your education  Why was I not born within the past thirty years  I might then have had some hopes of you myself —And this brings me to my former subject  of my nephew—But  Mr  Reeves  one word with you  Mr  Reeves  I beg your pardon  Ladies  But the importance of the matter will excuse   51 me  And I must get out of town as soon as I can —One word with you  Mr  Reeves   The gentlemen withdrew together  For breakfast by this time was over  And then the knight open d all his heart to Mr  Reeves  and besought his interest  He would afterwards have obtained an audience  as he called it  of me  But the three young Ladies haveing taken leave of us  and Mrs  Reeves and I being retired to dress  I desired to be excused   He then requested leave to attend me to morrow evening  But Mr  Reeves pleading engagements till Monday evening  he besought him to indulge him with his interest in that long gap of time  as he called it  and for my being then in the way   And thus  Lucy  have I given you an ample account of what has passed with regard to this new servant  as gentlemen call themselves  in order to become our masters    Tis now Friday morning  We are just setting out to dine with Lady Betty  If the day furnishes me with any amusing materials for my next pacquet  its agreeableness will be doubled to  Your ever affectionate HARRIET BYRON   LETTER X  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   Friday Night   SOME amusement  my Lucy  the day has afforded  Indeed more than I could
