  I have no pleasure in my   memory  which impresses things upon me  that I could be glad never were    or everlastingly to forget       Well  said he  so much for that  But where are the accounts  since you   have kept so exact a journal of all that has befallen you  previous to   these here in my hand  My father has them  sir  said I   By whose means    said he  By Mr  Williams s  said I  Well answered  said he  But cannot   you contrive to get me a sight of them  That would be pretty  said I  I   wish I could have contrived to have kept those you have from your sight    Said he  I must see them  Pamela  or I shall never be easy  for I must   know how this correspondence between you and Williams began  and if I   can see them  it shall be better for you  if they answer what these give   me hope they will       I can tell you  sir  very faithfully  said I  what the beginning was    for I was bold enough to be the beginner  That won t do  said he    for though this may appear a punctilio to you  to me it is of high   importance  Sir  said I  if you please to let me go to my father  I will   send them to you by any messenger you shall send for them  Will you so    But I dare say  if you will write for them  they will send them to you    without the trouble of such a journey to yourself  and I beg you will       I think  sir  said I  as you have seen all my former letters through   John s baseness  and now these  through your faithful housekeeper s   officious watchfulness  you might see all the rest  But I hope you   will not desire it  till I can see how much my pleasing you in this   particular will be of use to myself       You must trust to my honour for that  But tell me  Pamela  said the sly   gentleman  since I have seen these  would you have voluntarily shewn me   those  had they been in your possession       I was not aware of this inference  and said  Yes  truly  sir  I think   I should  if you commanded it  Well then  Pamela  said he  as I am sure   you have found means to continue your journal  I desire  till the former   part can come  that you will shew me the succeeding   O sir  sir  said   I  have you caught me so   But indeed you must excuse me there       Why  said he  tell me truly  have you not continued your account till   now  Don t ask me  sir  said I  But I insist upon your answer  replied   he  Why then  sir  I will not tell an untruth  I have   That s my good   girl  said he  I love sincerity at my heart   In another  sir  said I    I presume you mean   Well  said he  I ll allow you to be a little witty   upon me  because it is in you  and you cannot help it  but you will   greatly oblige me  to shew me voluntarily what you have written  I long   to see the particulars of your plot  and your disappointment  where your   papers leave off  for you have so beautiful a manner  that it is partly   that  and partly my love for you  that has made me desirous of reading   all you write  though a great deal of it is against myself  for which   you must expect to suffer a little  and as I have furnished you with the   subject  I have a title to see the fruits of your pen   Besides  said   he  there is such a pretty air of romance  as you relate them  in your   plots  and my plots  that I shall be better directed in what manner to   wind up the catastrophe of the pretty novel       If I was your equal  sir  said I  I should say this is a very provoking   way of jeering at the misfortunes you have brought upon me       O  said he  the liberties you have taken with my character in your   letters  sets us upon a par  at least in that respect  Sir  I could not   have taken those liberties  if you had not given me the cause  and the   cause
