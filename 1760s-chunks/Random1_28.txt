but the experience I had of the world made me suspend my belief till to morrow morning  when  getting up betimes  we breakfasted with our host and his daughter  on hasty pudding and ale  and desired to know what we had to pay —   Biddy will let you know  gentlemen  said he  for I never mind these matters —Money matters are beneath the concern of one who lives on the Horatian plan —Crescentem sequitur cura pecuniam    Mean while Biddy having consulted a slate that hung in a corner  told us  our reckoning came to 8s  7d —   Eight shillings and seven pence  cried Strap   tis impossible—you must be mistaken  young woman  —   Reckon again  child   says her father  very deliberately  perhaps you have miscounted  —   No indeed  father   she replied  I know my business better  —  I could contain my indignation no longer  but said it was a very unconscionable bill  and demanded to know the particulars  upon which the old man got up  muttering   Ay  ay  let us see the particulars —that s but reasonable  —  And taking pen  ink  and paper  wrote the following Items          s   d   To bread and beer  0  6  To a fowl and sausages  2  6  To four bottles quadrim    2  0  To fire and tobacco  0  7  To lodging  2  0  To breakfast  1  0     8  7      72 As he had not the appearance of a common publican  and had raised a sort of veneration in me by his demeanor the preceding night  it was not in my power to unbraid him as he deserved  therefore I contented myself with saying  I was sure he did not learn to be an extortioner from Horace  He answered     I was a but young man and did not know the world  or I would not tax him with extortion  whose only aim was to live contentus parvo  and keep off importuna pauperies  —  My fellow traveller could not so easily put up with this imposition  but swore he should either take one third of the money  or go without —While we were engaged in this dispute  I perceived the daughter go out  and conjecturing the occasion  immediately paid the exorbitant demand  which was no sooner done  than Biddy returned with two stout fellows  who came in on pretence of taking their morning draught  but in reality to frighten us into compliance —Just as we departed  Strap  who was half distracted on account of this piece of expence  went up to the school master  and grinning in his face  pronounced with great emphasis    Semper avarus eget  —  To which the pedant replied  with a malicious smile —   Animum rege  qui  nisi paret  imperat        73  CHAP  XI   We descry the waggon—get into it—arrive at an inn—our fellow travellers described—a mistake is committed by Strap  which produces strange things   WE travelled half a mile without exchanging one word  my thoughts being engrossed by the knavery of the world  to which I must be daily exposed  and the contemplation of my finances  which began sensibly to diminish —At length Strap  who could hold no longer  addressed me thus —   Well  fools and their money are soon parted —If my advice had been taken  that old skin flint should have been damn d before he had got more than the third of his demand — Tis a sure sign you came easily by your money  when you squander it away in this manner —Ah  God help you  how many brisly beards must I have mowed before I earned 4 shillings and three pence halfpenny  which is all thrown to the dogs —How many days have I sat weaving hair  till my toes were numbed by the cold  my fingers cramp d  and my nose as blue as the sign of the periwig that hung over the door —What the devil was you afraid of  I would have engaged to box with any one of those fellows who came in  for a guinea —I m sure I have beat stouter men than either of them  —  And indeed  my companion would have fought   74 any body  when his life was in no danger  but he had a mortal aversion to fire arms and all instruments of death  In order to appease him  I assured him  no part of this extraordinary expence should fall upon his shoulders  at which he was affronted  and told me  he would have me to know  that although he was a poor barber s boy  he had a soul to spend his money with the best  squire of the land —Having walked all day at a great pace  without halting for a refreshment  we descried towards the evening  to our inexpressible joy  the waggon about a quarter of a mile before us  and by that time we came up with it  were both of us so weary  that I verily believe it would have
