sensations  to see three very different faces in the same persons  from those they had entered with  I imagined more than once  as the grateful eyes of the sister  and tongues of the brothers  expressed their joy  that I saw my late worthy friend looking down upon us  delighted  and not with disapprobation  upon his choice of an executor  who was determined to supply the defects  which the frailty of human nature  by an ever strong resentment on one hand  and an overflowing gratitude on the other  had occasioned   I told Mr  Thomas Danby  that besides his legacy  he might reckon upon five thousand pounds  and enter accordingly into treaty for and with his master s niece   Mr  Edward Danby  I commissioned  on the strength of the like additional sum  to treat with the gentleman he had served   And you  my good Miss Danby  said I  shall acquaint your favoured Mr  Galliard  That  besides the two thousand pounds already yours  you will have five   343 thousand pounds more at his service  And if these sums answer not your full purposes  I expect you will let me know  since  whether they do or not  my respect to the memory of your worthy uncle shall be shewn to the value of more than these three sums to his relations  I never will be a richer man than I ought to be  And you must inform me  what other relations you have  and of their different situations in life  that I may be enabled to amend a will  made in a long and painful sickness  which might four a disposition that was naturally all benevolence   They wept  looked at one another  dried their eyes  and wept again  Mr  Sylvester also wept for joy  I thought my presence painful to them  and withdrew to my Study  and shut the door  that I might not add to their pain   At my return—Do you—Do you  referred each brother to the other  And Mr  Thomas Danby getting up to speak  I see  my friends  said I  your grateful hearts in your countenances  Do you think my pleasure is not  at least  equal to yours  I am more than rewarded in the consciousness of having endeavoured to make a right use of the power entrusted to me  You will each of you  I hope  thus set forward  be eminent in his particular business  The merchants of Great Britain are the most useful members of the community  If I have obliged you  let me recommend to you  each in his several way  according to his ability  and as opportunity may offer  to raise those worthy hearts  that inevitable calamities shall make spiritless  Look upon what is done for you  not as the reward of any particular merits in yourselves  but as your debt to that Providence  which makes it a principal part of your religion  To do good to your fellow creatures  In a word  let me enjoin you  in all your transactions  to remember mercy  as well as justice   The brothers with folded hands  declared  that   344 their hearts were opened by the example set them  and  they hoped  would never be shut  The sister looked the same declaration   Mr  Sylvester  raised with this scene of gratitude  tears in his honest eyes  said  That he should be impatient till he had looked into his affairs  and thro  his acquaintance  in order to qualify himself to do some little good  after such a self rewarding example   If a private man  my dear Dr  Bartlett  could be a means of expanding thus the hearts of four persons  none of them unworthy  what good might not princes  and those who have princely fortunes  do —Yet  you see  I have done nothing but mere justice  I have not given up any thing that was my own  before this Will gave me a power  that perhaps was put into my hands  as a new trial of the integrity of my heart   But what poor creatures are we  my dear friend  that the very avoiding the occasion of a wrong action  should gladden our hearts  as with the consciousness of something meritorious   At parting  I told the nephews  That I expected to hear from them the moment any thing should be brought to effect  and let their masters and them agree  or not  I would take the speediest methods that could be fallen upon  to transfer to them  and to their sister  such actions and stocks  as would put them in full possession of what they were intitled to  as well by my promise  as by their uncle s will   I was obliged to injoin them silence   Their sister wept  and when I pressed her hand at taking leave of her  gratefully returned the pressure  but in a manner so modest  recollecting herself into some little confusion  that shewed gratitude had possession of her whole heart  and set her above the forms of her sex   The good attorney  as much raised  as if he were one of the persons benefited
