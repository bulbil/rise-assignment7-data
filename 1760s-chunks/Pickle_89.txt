piece  desiring him to do his duty without farther  jaw  The young man accordingly fired  and the distance being small   the wad of his pistol took place with a smart stroke on the forehead of  Trunnion  Mistaking it for a ball  which he thought lodged in his brain   spurred up his steed in a state of desperation towards his antagonist   and holding his piece within two yards of his body  let it off  without  any regard to the laws of battle  Surprised and enraged to see it had  made no impression  he halloed  in a terrible tone   O  d ye  you have  your netting stuffed  I see   and advancing  he discharged his second  pistol so near his godson s head  that had he not been defended by his  great coat  the powder must have scorched his face  Having thus thrown  away his fire  he remained at the mercy of Peregrine  who clapping the  piece he had in reserve to his head  commanded him to beg his life   and ask pardon for his presumption  The commodore made no reply to this  imperious injunction  but  dropping his pistol  and unsheathing his  broad sword in an instant  attacked our hero with such incredible  agility  that if he had not made shift to ward off the stroke with his  piece  the adventure  in all likelihood  would have turned out a very  tragical joke   Peregrine finding it would be in vain for him to think of drawing his  weapon  or of standing on the defensive against this furious aggressor   very fairly clapped spurs to his nag  and sought his safety in flight   Trunnion pursued him with infinite eagerness  and his steed being the  better of the two  would have overtaken the fugitive to his peril  had  he not been unfortunately encountered by the boughs of a tree  that  happened to stand on his blind side  and incommoded him so much  that  he was fain to quit his sword  and lay hold on the mane in order to  maintain his seat  Perry perceiving his disaster  wheeled about  and now  finding leisure to produce his weapon  returned upon his disarmed foe   brandishing his Ferrara  threatening to make him shorter by the head  if he would not immediately crave quarter and yield  There was nothing    6 22 15  3 45 PM   farther from the intention of the old gentleman than such submission   which he flatly refused to pay  alleging that he had already compelled  his enemy to clap on all sails  and that his own present misfortune was  owing to accident  all one as if a ship should be attacked  after she  had been obliged to heave her guns overboard in a storm   Before Peregrine had time to answer this remonstrance  the lieutenant  interposed  and taking cognizance of the case  established a truce   until he and the other second should discuss and decide upon the merits  of the case  They accordingly retired to a small distance  and after  having conferred a few minutes  Hatchway returned and pronounced the  commodore vanquished by the chance of war   Never was rage more than that which took possession of old Hannibal   when he heard the sentence  it was some time before he could utter  aught  except the reproachful expression   You lie   which he repeated  more than twenty times  in a sort of delirious insensibility  When he  recovered the further use of speech  he abused the arbitrators with such  bitter invectives  renouncing their sentence  and appealing to another  trial  that the confederates began to repent of having carried the joke  so far  and Peregrine  in order to appease his choler  owned himself  overcome   This acknowledgment calmed the tumult of his wrath  though he could not  for some days forgive the lieutenant  and the two young gentlemen rode  back to Tunley s  while Hatchway  taking the commodore s horse by the  bridle  reconducted him to his mansion  growling all the way to Jack for  his unjust and unfriendly decree  though he could not help observing   as how he had made his words good  in making his adversary to strike his  top sails   And yet   said he   before God  I think the fellow s head is  made of a wood pack  for my shot rebounded from his face like a wad of  spun yarn from the walls of a ship  But if so be that son of a b   of  a tree hadn t come athwart my weather bow  d ye see  I ll be d  d if  I hadn t snapt his main yard in the slings  and mayhap let out his  bulge water into the bargain   He seemed particularly vain of this  exploit  which dwelt upon his imagination  and was cherished as the  child of his old age  for though he could not with decency rehearse  it to the young men and his wife at supper  he gave hints of his own  manhood  even
