the romanticism of the tales of chivalry that had so long delighted the taste of Europe  The sub title of Alemán s famous novel  Guzmán de Alfarache  was Atalaya de la Vida which Chapelain translated by  Image  or  Miroir de la Vie Humaine   And long before Lesage  the author of L Histoire Comique de Francion used almost the identical terms of Alemán and Lesage in announcing his tale  Nous avons dessein de voir une image de la vie humaine  de sorte qu il nous en faut montrer ici diverses pièces   Francion  less picaresque than the hero of Alemán  was undoubtedly what he has been called by one of Lesage s biographers  M  Lintilhac  a direct precursor of Gil Blas  and there can be no question as to the importance of the influence exercised upon Lesage by Charles Sorel s admirable performance  But  however easily even a little erudition can discover possible prototypes of Gil Blas in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century literature of both France and Spain    however picaresque  in a word  Gil Blas may be  and whatever else it may be    its picaresqueness was obviously  for Lesage  not an end in itself  but merely a device for carrying out his main project  which was  the representation of life   and the meaning he put into those words was incomparably richer than was their connotation on the lips of an Alemán or even a Sorel  Lesage found ready to his hand one of the most convenient literary forms tint the novel ever assumed for the achievement of the end he had in view  That end was to hold a mirror up to Nature  and to the whole of Nature   This ambitious project has haunted most observers who have essayed the novel form  It was obviously the end and aim of the author of Anna Karenina  But such is the complexity of human relations  such the variety of the kinds of human plights  such the swift passage of events  such are the endless differences and the fleeting character of the situations presented to the artistic consciousness at any moment of time  that only the most self confident craftsman would be tempted  in his sane mind  to undertake their complete representation  The mirror in which a writer would seek to converge and to foreshorten the vast spectacle of things must needs be an all but unmanageable revolving mirror of gigantic dimensions  unless some way he found of dispensing with such machinery altogether  Tolstoi made no attempt to achieve an artistic synthesis of life as a whole  He was content to map life out on a sort of Mercator s projection  Balzac despaired altogether of success  and confined himself to  doing  the multitudinous phases of human activity piecemeal  Lesage  on the other hand  hit on the happy idea of using the picaro type  the picaresque tradition in the novel  to facilitate his project  And what device  in fact  could be neater and more rapid  Certainly not the invention of Zola  The author of the series of the Rougon Macquart set himself the task of describing the whole of French society at the end of the last century  He believed himself to have improved on Balzac s method by conceiving of a family tree  with branches sufficiently wide  spreading to illustrate every kind of activity of which French men or French women were capable in his time  The unity of his result was to be secured by postulating a family  the sum of the several lives of whose members should be coterminous with the Conscious existence of all their essential French fellow types at a certain historical period  The plan was ingenious but artificially ingenuous   Lesage  writing at the opening of the eighteenth century  had  it is true  the luck to be free to employ    or  in fact  to have thrust upon him by the literary taste of his time    a simpler trick for the representation of life  The literary air was full of picaresque odours  But  while Lesage came after Sorel and Alemán  and a score of other same story tellers eager to temper the bombast of the hour by the saving salt of realism  the living models that surrounded him were quite as suggestive as any he might have been led to imitate in the books of his predecessors  Lintilhac  Cherbuliez  Brunetière  have dwelt in detail on this fact  What need had Lesage of a Guzmán or a Francion  when before his very eyes were such conspicuous models for the study of the valet parvenu as the Cardinals Dubois and Alberoni  And why go farther afield than the memoirs of the famous Gourville  which appeared in 1673  if one really feels impelled at all costs to account for the origin of Gil Blas  and to answer the futile question   Where did Lesage get his idea   That kind of inquiry explains everything except the essential  Homer and Shakespeare  Walter Scott and Corneille  have been put to the same torture as Lesage  and in the folds of their royal robes whole colonies of industrious parasitic moths are still furiously and often enviously at work  There is a  Lesage question  as there is an  Homeric question   But of this the public recks little  It sanely holds the view of M  de Maurepas  who wittily
