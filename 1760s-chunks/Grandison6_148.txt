said her delighted grandmother  you see▪ can hardly bare your goodness  Sir  You must blame her for something  to keep down her pride   My Harriet  replied he  cannot be proud of what the silkworm can do for her  or of the jeweller s polish  But now you call upon me  madam  I will tax her with a real fault  I open all my heart to her  as subjects occasionally offer  I want her to have a will  and to let me know it  The frankest of all Female hearts will not treat me with that sweet familiarity which banishes distance  You see  my dearest Love  that I chide you before your parental friends  and your Lucy   It is your own fault  Sir  Indeed it is  You prevent me in all my wishes  Awe will mingle with the Love of persons who are under perpetual obligation    369 My dear two mamma s  you must not blame me  you must blame Sir Charles  He takes away  by his goodness  even the power of making suitable acknowlegements  and then complains I do not speak   My uncle Selby came in  He stood looking upon my cousin  for a few moments  in silence  then broke out  Sir Charles Grandison  you may indeed boast  that you have for a Wife the Flower of the British world  as you once called her  And  let me tell you  Niece  you have for a Husband the noblest and gallantest of men  Happy  happy Pair  say I  My dear Mr  Deane  said he  who just then entered  if you will keep me in countenance  I will venture to salute that charming creature   Sir Charles presented his Bride to them both  With a bent knee she received their salutes  At that moment came in the three Lords  who followed the example  Lord W  called her Angel—Sir Charles looked delighted with the praises of his Bride   The rest of the company being come  we proceeded to church   We were early  but the Church was crouded  How were the charming Couple admired on their alighting  and as they walked to their pew  Never did my Cousin herself look so lovely  How charmingly looked the Bridegroom  But he forgot not that humble deportment  full of reverence for the place  and the Divine Offices  which seemed to make him absent for the time to that splendor and beauty which took every eye out of our own pew  His example was enough to give a proper behaviour  had it been needful  to every one in it   I should have told your Ladyship  that Mr  Greville had sent  ever night  a sullenly complaisant request to my aunt  in writing  importing  that as he heard the Bride would make her appearance on the morrow  the Bride men and maids  if it broke not into our Ceremonial  would accept of his pew  which   370 is over against ours  for the look of the thing  he said  tho  he could not promise but he should all the day curse the occasion  By this we found  he was not gone to Lady Frampton s  as he had designed  His offer was thankfully accepted   There was a great concourse of the genteelest people there  Every body  men and women  looked delighted on the occasion  The humility of the Bride was tried  by the respects paid her between the offices  by all who had ever been in her company  They should have reined in their own pride  for it was to that  as much as to respect to her  I doubt not  that their notice was owing  She looked conscious  bashful  sly  I told her afterwards  She hates the word  But  as I said  she should not have given the idea  that made no other word so proper to express it  and which must be more observable in her generally open free countenance  than in that of any other  She more than once saw devoirs paid her by a leer  when her sweet face was so disposed  that  had she not returned the compliment  it might have passed that she had not seen them  But what an Insensible must have been my cousin  had she not been proud of being Lady Grandison  She is not quite an Angel  yet  She has a few Femalities  as my uncle whimsically calls our little foibles  So  perhaps  she should  But nobody saw the least defect in your brother  His dress most charmingly became him  and when he looked upon his Bride  his eyes were fixed on her eyes  with such a sweet benignity and complaisance  as if he saw her mind through them  and could not spare a glance to her ornaments  Yet by his own dress he shewed  that he was not Stoical non conformist to the fashion of the world  But the politeness and respect with which he treated her  did them both credit  and credit  as Lady G  observed  to the whole Sex  Such unaffected tenderness in his respect  and known to be so brave  so good a man —O my dear Lady
