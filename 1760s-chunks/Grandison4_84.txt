be  Sir Charles Grandison s generosity to the Danby s should be my example   Do you know  Mr  Fowler  said I  the contents of the Letter you have put into my hand   No farther than that my uncle told me  it contained professions of fatherly love  and with wishes only—But without so much as expressing his hopes   Sir Rowland is a good man  said I  I have not read above half his Letter  There seems to be too much of the father in it  for me to read further  before my brother  God bless my brother Fowler  and reward the fatherly love of Sir Rowland to his daughter Byron  I must write to him   Mr  Fowler  poor man  profoundly sighed  bowed  with such a look of respectful acquiescence—Bless   210 me  my dear  how am I to be distressed on all sides  by good men too  as Sir Charles could say by good women   Is there nothing less than giving myself to either  that I can do to shew Mr  Orme and Mr  Fowler my true value for them   Poor Mr  Fowler —Indeed he looks to be  as Sir Rowland hints  not well —Such a modest  such an humble  such a silent Lover —He cost me tears at parting  I could not hide them  He heaped praises and blessings upon me  and hurried away at last  to hide his emotion  with a sentence unfinished—God preserve you  dear and worthy Sir  was all I could try to say  The last words stuck in my throat  till he was out of hearing  and then I prayed for blessings upon him and his uncle  And repeated them  with fresh tears  on reading the rest of the affecting Letter   Mr  Fowler told Mr  Reeves  before I saw him  that he is to go to Caermarthen for the benefit of his native air  in a week  He let him know where he lodged in town  He had been riding for his health and diversion about the country  ever since his uncle went  and has not been yet at Caermarthen   I wish Mr  Fowler had once  if but once  called me sister  It would have been such a kind acquiescence  as would have given me some little pleasure on recollection  Methinks I don t know how to have done writing of Sir Rowland and Mr  Fowler   I sat down  however  while the uncle and nephew filled my thoughts  and wrote to the former  I have enclosed the copy of my Letter  Adieu  my Lucy     211  LETTER XXX  Moss BYRON  To Sir ROWLAND MEREDITH    Wednesday  April 19   IT was with great pleasure that I received  this day  the kindest Letter that ever was written by a real Father to his dearest Child  I was resolved that I would not go to rest till I had acknowleged the favour   How sweet is the name of father to a young person who  out of near one and twenty years of life  has for more than half the time been bereaved of hers  and who was also one of the best of men   You gave me an additional pleasure in causing this remembrance of your promised paternal goodness to be given me by Mr  Fowler in person  Till I knew you and him  I had no father  no brother   How good you are in your apprehensions that there may be a man on whom your daughter has cast her eye  and who cannot look upon her with the same distinction—O that I had been near you when you wrote that sweetly compassionating  that indulgent passage  I would have wiped the tears from your eyes myself  and reverenced you as my true father   You demand of me  as my father  a hint  or half a hint  as you call it  to be given to my brother Fowler  or if not to him  to you  To him  whom I call father  I mean all the duty of a child  I call him not father nominally only  I will  irksome as the subject is  own  without reserve  the truth to you  In tenderness to my brother  how could I to him  —There is a man whom  and whom only  I could love as a good wife ought to love her husband  He is the best of men  O my good Sir Rowland Meredith  if you knew him  you would love him yourself  and own him for your son  I will not conceal his name from   212 my father  Sir Charles Grandison is the man  Enquire about him  His character will rise upon you from every mouth  He engaged first all your daughter s gratitude  by rescuing her from a great danger and oppression  for he is as brave as he is good  And how could she help suffering a tenderness to spring up from her gratitude  of which she was never before sensible to any man in the world  There is something in the way  my good Sir  but not that proceeds from his slights or contempts  Your daughter could not live  if
