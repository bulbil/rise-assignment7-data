and desolation  a man seemed raised up to his bleeding country  to defend its rights  improve the age in which he lived  and even to adorn humanity  Alfred the Great was the fourth son of Ethelwolfe  King of England  and had received the earlier part of his education under the inspection of Pope Leo  in Rome  which was at that time the chief seat of arts and learning in Europe  Upon the death of his elder brother  Ethelred  he was called   40 to the English throne  of which he was only nominally put in possession  the country being overrun by the Danes  who governed with cruelty and pride   His reign began with wars  and he was forced into the field immediately upon his coronation  His first battles were fought with merited success  but  at length  being overpowered by a Danish combination  the unfortunate Alfred was obliged to seek safety by flight  In this manner being abandoned by the world  without succour  and fearing an enemy in every face  the royal fugitive was resolved not to forsake his country  as was usual with his predecessors  He retired to the cottage of a cowherd  in a solitary part of the county of Somerset  at the confluence of the rivers Parret and Thone  here he lived six months  as a servant  and  as we are told  was sometimes reproved for his indolence  by his mistress  the cowherd s wife  The Earl of Devonshire was alone privy to the place of his retreat  and happening to overthrow a body of the Danes  acquainted Alfred with the news of his success   Alfred now  therefore  began to consider how to turn the present consternation of the enemy to his own advantage  He apprized his friends with the place of his retreat  and instructed them to be ready  with what troops they could raise  upon a minute s warning  But still  none was found who would undertake to give intelligence of the forces  or posture of the enemy  Not knowing  therefore  who to confide in  he undertook this dangerous task himself  in the simple dress of a shepherd  with an harp in his hand  he entered the Danish camp  had admission to the principal generals  and was allowed to excel upon that instrument  He   41 soon perceived that they were divided among themselves  he seizes the favourable moment  flies to the Earl of Devonshire  heads his troops  forces their camp  and gains a complete victory   Alfred knew the arts of negotiation as well as those of war  he had sufficient address to cause himself to be acknowledged King by the Danes  as well as his own natural subjects  London still remained to be subdued  he besieged it  took and fortified it in a manner which was then thought impregnable  He fitted out a fleet  kept the Danes in his dominions under proper subjection  and repressed the invasions of others from abroad  His next care was to polish that country  by the arts of peace  which he had subdued by the arts of war  He is said to have drawn up a body of laws  but those which remain to this day  under his name  seem to be no more than laws already practifed in the country by his Saxon ancestors  and to which  probably  he gave his sanction  The trial by juries  mulcts and fines for offences  by some ascribed to him  are of a much more ancient date than his reign  It is sufficient to observe  that the penal laws of our ancestors were mild and humane  As a nation becomes more polite  the penal laws become more numerous and severe  till  at length  growing intolerable to the poor  against whom they are principally levelled  they throw off the yoke of legal bondage  either by admitting a despotic prince  or by taking the government into their own hands  by military invasion  I remember few great characters  in history  that had not a regard for the sciences  Alfred is said to have founded the university of Oxford  and supplied it with books from Rome  The spirit of superstition had quite suppressed all the efforts of philosophy   42 at that period  he is said to have lamented  that no priest  in all his dominions  understood Latin  as for him  he knew it  and was also well versed in the geometry of those barbarous ages  He was an excellent historian  made some translations from the Latin which still subsist and it is even said  that he composed some excellent poems in the Saxon language  Those hours which he could take from business he gave to study  He was a complete oeconomist  and this gave him an opportunity of being liberal  His care even extended to the manner in which the people built their houses  Before his time  the generality of the nation made use of timber  mostly  in building  Alfred having raised his palaces with brick  the nobility  by degrees  began to imitate his example   From his time  though the reigns immediately succeeding are marked with ignorance  superstition  and cruelty  yet  in general  history puts on a form less severe  the whole nation seems to emerge
