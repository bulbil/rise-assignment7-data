read aloud some part of the letter I had just writ to you  Lucy  We know  said she  it is about us  but we shall think what you have written  greatly to our disadvantage  if we cannot hear some of it  Then she insisted  she is an arbitrary dear creature  on my giving the company  It was at tea  and Lord L  present  such histories as she should call for of my own family  On this condition only  said she  will we consent to be made fully known  as I find we shall  if I do not steal away your pen and ink  to our grandmother Shirley  our aunt Selby  and even to our Lucy   Do not you think  Lucy  I ran on with pleasure in describing the persons and tempers of my father and mother  and relating their fortunes  loves  difficulties  as my grandmamma and aunt had enabled me to do  from what they used to recount in many a long summer day  and in many a winter evening  as we girls sat at work—Happy memorials —Ay  but do   134 you believe she did not question me about later events  She did  indeed  call upon me for two other histories   And of whom  methinks you ask   I won t tell you  Lucy  But if my aunt should be solicitous to know  and should guess that my uncle s and hers  so entertaining and instructive  was one of them  and if you  Lucy  should guess that the history of a young lady  whose discretion got the better of her Love  and who cannot be dearer to herself than she is to me  is the other—Why  perhaps neither my aunt nor you  my dear  may be much mistaken   Methinks I would fain rise now and then to my former serene pertness  Allow you of the words so connected    But my heart is heavy   They were delighted with a certain gentleman s humourous character and courtship  with his lady s prudence and goodness  in the one story  and in the other  with the young Lady s victorious discretion  They wish to be personally acquainted with each  and with my grandmamma  All the worthies in the world  my dear  are not in the Grandison family   BEFORE I resume the continuation of the Ladies family history  let me ask  Don t you think  my dear  that God has blessed these happy children  for the sake of their excellent mother  And who knows  but for their duty to their less deserving father  It is my notion  that one person s remissness in duty  where there is a reciprocal one  does not absolve the other party from the performance of his  It is difficult  indeed  to love so well a faulty or remiss parent  as a kind and good one  But our duty is indispensable  and where it is paid  a blessing may the rather be expected  as the parent has not done his  If  when you do well and suffer for it  says the Apostle  ye take it patiently  this is acceptable with God —Not to mention one consideration  which  however  ought not to be left out of the account  that a good child will be no   135 less benefitted by the warning  as Sir Charles no doubt is  from his father s unhappy turn  than by the example  as he is from that of his excellent mother   Lady L  referred to the paper given in by the shorthand writer  for the occasion  as mentioned by Sir Charles  to which these three worthy Children owed the loss of such a mother a  And this drew her into a melancholy relation of some very affecting particulars  Among other things  she said  her mother regretted  in her last hours  that she had no opportunity that she could think just and honourable  to lay by any thing considerable for her daughters  Her jewels  and some valuable trinkets  she hoped  would be theirs  But that would be at their father s pleasure  I wish  said she  that my dear girls were to have between them the tenth part of what I have saved—But I have done but my duty   I have told you  Charlotte  said the Countess  what my mother said to me  a few hours before she died  and I will repeat it to Miss Byron  After having upon general principles  recommended filial duty  and brotherly and sisterly love to us all  and after my brother and sister had withdrawn  My dear Careline  said she  let me add to the general arguments of the duty I have been enforcing upon you all  one respecting your interest  and let your sister know it  I am afraid there will be but a slender provision made for my dear girls  Your papa has the notion rivesed in him  which is common to men of antient families  that daughters are but incumbrances  and that the son is to be everything  He loves his girls  He loves you dearly  But he has often declared  that  were he to have entire all the fortune that descended to him
