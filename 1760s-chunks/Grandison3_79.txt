I hurried out of Lord L  s Study  and up stairs into my own chamber  she following me—Leave me  leave me here  dear creature  said I  for six minutes  I will attend you then  in your own dressing room   She kindly retired  I threw myself into a chair  indulged my tears for a few moments  and was the fitter to receive the two sisters  who  hand in hand  came into my room to comfort me   But I could not relate what had passed immediately with any connexion  I told them only  that all was over  that their brother was to be pitied  not blamed  And that if they would allow me to recollect some things that were most affecting  I would attend them    194 and they should have my narrative the more exact  for the indulgence   They stayed no longer with me than to see me a little composed   Sir Charles and Dr  Bartlett went out together in his chariot  He enquired more than once of my health  saying to his sister Charlotte  That he was afraid he had affected me too much  by the melancholy tale he had been telling me   He excused himself from dining with us  Poor man  What must be his distress —Not able to see  to sit with us   I would have excused myself also  being not very fit to appear  but was not permitted   I sat  however  but a very little while at table after dinner  and how tedious did the dinner time appear  The servants eyes were irksome to me  so were Emily s  dear girl   glistening as they did  tho  she knew not for what  but sympathetically  as I may say  she supposing  that all was not as she would have it   She came up soon after to me—One word  my dearest madam  the door in her hand  and her head only within it   Tell me only that there is no misunderstanding between my guardian and you —Tell me only that—  None  my dear —None  none at all  my Emily   Thank God  clasping her hands together  thank God —If there were  I should not have known whose part to take —But I won t disturb you—And was going   Stay  stay  my precious young friend  Stay  my Emily —I arose  took her hand  My sweet girl  say  Will you live with me   God for ever bless you  dearest madam —Will I  It is the wish next my heart   Will you go down with me to Northamptonshire  my love   To the world s end I will attend you  madam  I   195 will be your handmaid  and I will love you better than I love my guardian  if possible   Ah my dear  but how will you live without seeing your guardian now and then   Why he will live with us  won t he   No  no  my dear —And you would choose  then  to live with him  not with me  would you not —  Indeed but I won t—Indeed I will live and die with you  if you will let me  and I warrant his kind heart will often lead him to us  But tell me  Why these tears  madam  Why this grief —Why do you speak so quick and short  and why do you seem to be in such a hurry   Do I speak quick and short  Do I seem to be in a hurry —Thank you  my love  for your observation  And now leave me  I will profit by it   The amiable girl withdrew on tiptoe  and I sat about composing myself   I was obliged to her for her observation  It was really of use to me  But you must think  Lucy  that I must be fluttered—His manner of leaving me—Was it not particular —To break from me so abruptly  as I may say—And what he said with looks so earnest  Looks that seemed to carry more meaning than his words  And withdrawing without conducting me out  as he had led me in—and as if—I don t know how as if—But you will give me your opinion of all these things  I can t say but I think my suspense is over  and in a way not very desireable—Yet—But why should I puzzle myself  What must be  must   At afternoon tea  the gentlemen not being returned  and Emily undertaking the walter s office  I gave my Lord and the two Ladies  tho  she was present  some account of what had passed  but briefly  and I had just finished  and was quitting the room  as the two gentlemen entered the door   Sir Charles Instantly addressed me with apologies for   196 the concern he had given me  His emotion was visible as he spoke to me  He hesitated  He trembled  Why did he hesitate  Why did he tremble   I told him  I was not ashamed to own  that I was very much affected by the melancholy story  The poor Lady  said I  is greatly to be pitied—But remember  Sir
