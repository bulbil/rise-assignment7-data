 Was there any question about my courage that I should be thought incompetent to reduce my rebellious subjects to their obedience  Means might have been found to punish the constable had he dared to have fallen off from his allegiance  I am well aware of the difference between a lawful king and an arbitrary tyrant  The happiness of our people is our first duty  But are we  on the other hand  to be the slaves of our subjects  From the moment when we are selected by heaven for our high office  do we lose the common privilege of nature  the birthright of the human race  to dispose of our affections in whatsoever current they may flow  Well then  if we are less our own masters than the lowest of the human race  take back  Siffredi  that sovereign authority you affect to have secured to me by the wreck of my personal happiness   You cannot but be acquainted  my liege  replied the minister  that it was on your marriage with the princess  the late king  your uncle  made the succession of the crown to depend  And by what right  rejoined Enriquez  did even he assume to himself so arbitrary a disposition  Was it on such unworthy terms that he succeeded his brother  King Charles  How came you yourself to be so besotted as to allow of a stipulation so unjust  For a high chancellor  you are not too well versed in our laws and constitutions  To cut the matter short  though I have promised my hand to Constance  the engagement was not voluntary  I do not therefore think myself bound to keep my word  and if Don Pedro founds on my refusal any hope of succeeding to the throne without involving the nation in a bloody and destructive contest  his error will be too soon visible  The sword shall decide between us to whom the prize of empire may more worthily fall  Leontio could not venture to press him further  and confined himself to supplicating on his knees for the liberty of his son in law  That boon he obtained  Go  said the king to him  return to Belmonte  the constable shall follow you thither without delay  The minister departed  and made the best of his way to Belmonte  under the persuasion that his son in law would overtake him on the road  In this he was mistaken  Enriquez was determined to visit Blanche that night  and with such views he deferred the enlargement of her husband till the next morning   During this time the feelings of the constable were of the most agonizing nature  His imprisonment had opened his eyes to the real cause of his misfortune  He gave himself up to jealousy without restraint or remorse  and belying the good faith which had hitherto rendered his character so valuable  his thoughts were all bent on his revenge  As he conjectured rightly that the king would not fail to reconnoitre Blanche s apartment during the night  it was his object to surprise them together  He therefore besought the governor of the castle at Palermo to allow of his absence from the prison  on the assurance of his return before daybreak  The governor  who was devoted to his interest  gave his permission so much the more easily  as being already advertised that Siffredi had procured his liberty  Indeed  he even went so far as to supply him with a horse for his journey to Belmonte  The constable on his arrival there fastened his horse to a tree  He then got into the park by a little gate of which he had the key  and was lucky enough to slip into the castle without being recognized by any one  On reaching his wife s apartment he concealed himself in the ante chamber  behind a screen placed as if expressly for his use  His intention was to observe narrowly what was going forward  and to present himself on a sudden in Blanche s chamber at the sound of any footstep he should hear  The first object he beheld was Nisa  taking leave of her mistress for the night  and withdrawing to a closet where she slept   Siffredi s daughter  who had been at no loss to fathom the meaning of her husband s imprisonment  was fully convinced that he would not return to Belmonte that night  although she had heard from her father of the king s assurance that the constable should set out immediately after him  As little could she doubt but Enriquez would avail himself of the interval to see and converse with her at his pleasure  With this expectation she awaited the prince s arrival  to reproach him for a line of conduct so pregnant with fatal consequences to herself  As she had anticipated  a very short time after Nisa had retired the sliding panel opened  and the king threw himself at the feet of his beloved  Madam  said he  condemn me not without a hearing  It is true I have occasioned the constable s imprisonment  but then consider that it was the only method left me for my justification  Attribute therefore that desperate stratagem to yourself alone  Why did you refuse to listen to my explanation this morning  Alas  To morrow your husband will be liberated  and I shall no longer have an opportunity of addressing you  Hearken to me then for the last time  If the loss
