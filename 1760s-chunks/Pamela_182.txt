embrace all the opportunities they will be pleased to give me       Mrs  Peters whispered Lady Jones  as my master told me afterwards  Did   you ever see such excellence  such prudence  and discretion  Never in my   life  said the other good lady  She will adorn  she was pleased to say    her distinction  Ay  says Mrs  Peters  she would adorn any station in   life       My good master was highly delighted  generous gentleman as he is  with   the favourable opinion of the ladies  and I took the more pleasure in   it  because their favour seemed to lessen the disgrace of his stooping   so much beneath himself       Lady Darnford said  We will not oppress you  though we could almost   blame your too punctilious exactness  but if we excuse Miss Andrews from   dinner  we must insist upon her company at the card table  and at a dish   of tea  for we intend to pass the whole day with you  sir  as we told   you  What say you to that  Pamela  said my master  Sir  replied I    whatever you and the ladies please  I will cheerfully do  They said  I   was very obliging  But Sir Simon rapt out an oath  and said  That they   might dine together  if they would  but he would dine with me  and   nobody else  for  said he  I say  sir  as Parson Williams said   by   which I found my master had told them the story   You must not think you   have chosen one that nobody can like but yourself       The young ladies said  If I pleased they would take a turn about the   garden with me  I answered  I would very gladly attend them  and so we   three  and Lady Jones s sister in law  and Mr  Peters s niece  walked   together  They were very affable  kind  and obliging  and we soon   entered into a good deal of familiarity  and I found Miss Darnford a   very agreeable person  Her sister was a little more on the reserve  and   I afterwards heard  that  about a year before  she would fain have had   my master make his addresses to her  but though Sir Simon is reckoned   rich  she was not thought sufficient fortune for him  And now  to have   him look down so low as me  must be a sort of mortification to a poor   young lady   And I pitied her   Indeed I did   I wish all young persons   of my sex could be as happy as I am like to be       My master told me afterwards  that I left the other ladies  and Sir   Simon and Mr  Peters  full of my praises  so that they could hardly talk   of any thing else  one launching out upon my complexion  another upon my   eyes  my hand  and  in short  for you ll think me sadly proud  upon   my whole person and behaviour  and they all magnified my readiness and   obligingness in my answers  and the like  And I was glad of it  as I   said  for my good master s sake  who seemed quite pleased and rejoiced    God bless him for his goodness to me       Dinner not being ready  the young ladies proposed a tune upon the   spinnet  I said  I believed it was not in tune  They said  they knew   it was but a few months ago  If it is  said I  I wish I had known it    though indeed  ladies  added I  since you know my story  I must own    that my mind has not been long in tune  to make use of it  So they would   make me play upon it  and sing to it  which I did  a song my dear good   lady made me learn  and used to be pleased with  and which she brought   with her from Bath  and the ladies were much taken with the song  and   were so kind as to approve my performance  And Miss Darnford was pleased   to compliment me  that I had all the accomplishments of my sex  I said    I had had a good lady  in my master s mother  who had spared no   pains nor cost to improve me  She said  she wished Mr  B     could be   prevailed upon to give a ball on an approaching happy occasion  that we   might have a dancing match  etc   But I can t say I do  though I did not   say so  for these occasions  I think  are
