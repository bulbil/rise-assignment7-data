 and from thence  the evening of May 2  O  S  got to Parma by way of Alexandria and Placentia  having purposely avoided the high road   276 through Milan  as it would have cost us a few hours more time   Sir Charles observed to me  when we were on the plain or flat top of Mount Cenis  that  had not the winter been particularly long and severe  we should have had  instead of this terrible appearance of snow there  flowers starting up  as it were  under our feet  of various kinds  which are hardly to be met with anywhere else  One of the greatest dangers  he told me  in passing this mount in winter  arises from a ball of snow  which is blown down from the top by the wind  or falls down by some other accident  which  gathering all the way in its descent  becomes instantly of such a prodigious bigness  that there is hardly any avoiding being carried away with it  man and beast  and smothered in it  One of these balls we saw rolling down  but as it took another course than ours  we had no apprehensions of danger from it   At Parma we found expecting us  the Bishop of Nocera  and a very Reverend Father  Marescotti by name  who expressed the utmost joy at the arrival of Sir Charles Grandison  and received me  at his recommendation  with a politeness which seems natural to them  I will not repeat what I have written before of this excellent young gentleman  Intrepidity  bravery  discretion  as well as generosity  are conspicuous parts of his character  He is studious to avoid danger  but is unappalled in it  For humanity  benevolence  providence for others  to his very servants  I never met with his equal   My reception from the noble family to which he has introduced me  the patient s case  a very unhappy one    and a description of this noble city  and the fine country about it  shall be the subject of my next  Assure all my friends of my health  and good wishes for them  and  my dear Arnold  believe me to be  Ever Yours   c     277  LETTER XL  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  To Dr  BARTLETT    Bologna  Wednesday  May 10 21   I Told you  my dear and reverend friend  that I should hardly write to you till I arrived in this city   The affair of my executorship obliged me to stay a day longer at Paris than I intended  but I have put every thing relating to that trust in such a way  as to answer all my wishes   Mr  Lowther wrote to Mr  Arnold  a friend of his in London  the particulars of the extraordinary affair we were engaged in between St  Denis and Paris  with desire that he would inform my friends of our arrival at that capital   We were obliged to stop two days at St  Jean de Maurienne  The expedition we travelled with was too much for Mr  Lowther  and I expected  and was not disappointed  from the unusual backwardness of the season  to find the passage over Mount Cenis less agreeable than it usually is in the beginning of May   The Bishop of Nocera had offered to meet me any where on his side of the mountains  I wrote to him from Lyons  that I hoped to see him at Parma  on or about the very day that I was so fortunate as to reach the palace of the Count of Belvedere in that city  where I found  that he and Father Marescotti had arrived the evening before  They  as well as the Count  expressed great joy to see me  and when I presented Mr  Lowther to them  with the praises due to his skill  and let them know the consultations I had had with eminent physicians of my own country  on Lady Clementina s case  they invoked blessings upon us both  and would not be interrupted in them by my eager questions after the health and state of mind   278 of the two dearest persons of their family—Unhappy  very unhappy  said the Bishop  Let us give you some refreshment  before we come to particulars   To my repeated enquiries  Jeronymo  poor Jeronymo  said the Bishop  is living  and that is all we can say —The sight of you will be a cordial to his heart  Clementina is on her journey to Bologna from Naples  You desired to find her with us  and not at Naples  She is weak  is obliged to travel slowly  She will rest at Urbino two or three days  Dear creature  What has she not suffered from the cruelty of her cousin Laurana  as well as from her malady  The General has been  and is  indulgent to her  He is married to a Lady of great merit  quality  and fortune  He has  at length  consented that we shall try this last experiment  as the hearts of my mother and now lately of my father  as well as mine  are in it  His Lady would not be denied accompanying my sister  and as
