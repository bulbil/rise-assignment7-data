woman’s folly almost frees her from the suspicion of its being of her own contriving   May 10  You cannot imagine  my Cecilia  how happy I think myself  after such a hurrying winter as I have had  to find myself once more restored to my favourite pleasures  the calm delights of solitude  Arnold abbey seems a paradise to me now   Lady Grimston shewed me a specimen of her humour this morning  in talking of the widow Arnold  She said she was an harlot  that having already disgraced the family  now wanted to beggar them  but that if Mr Arnold did not make an example of her  she would never own him for a kinsman   My chearful old Dean says  he is now completely happy  having lived to see his daughter married  while we were in town  very much to his and her satisfaction  I am heartily glad of it  neither am I sorry  for her sake  that she has left the country   May 11  Mrs Vere is come to spend a few weeks with me according to her promise  She is a truly amiable creature  her disposition so gentle  her temper so mild  such a sweet humility in her whole deportment  that it astonishes me her mother can still persist in her unkindness to her  But the eldest daughter was always her darling  who I understand is pretty much of her mother’s own cast  and makes a very termagant wife to a very turbulent husband  So that notwithstanding    their title  for he is a Baronet  and immense riches  they are a very miserable pair   They were lately to pay lady Grimston a visit  but there happened such a frecas  that probably it may be the last she will ever receive from them  The husband  it seems  though very rough and surly in his nature  is  notwithstanding  a well meaning man  and not void of humanity  which had induced him to give a small portion to a young girl  a distant relation of his own  who had been left an orphan  She was beloved by the son of a substantial farmer  a tenant of the baronet’s  and had an equal affection for him  but the young man  depending entirely on his father for his future prospects  durst not take a wife without something to begin the world with  for his father had just put him into the management of one of his farms  The young lady and her mother  who was a widow  and is but lately dead  had boarded for some years at this honest farmer’s house  and in that time a mutual love had been contracted between the young people  The old man himself liked the girl so well for a daughter in law  that his only objection was her want of fortune  but this was such an obstacle as was not to be surmounted by a man  who  being accustomed to earn money by indefatigable industry  put the utmost value upon it  His regard to his son’s happiness  however  made him resolve to try an experiment in his favour  and accordingly he plucked up courage  and went to his landlord  He told him  in his own blunt way  that he came to speak to him in behalf of a poor young gentlewoman that was his  Sir William’s  relation  I have a son that loves her  said he  and she loves him  but I cannot afford to let the boy marry a wife that has nothing  and you know she has no portion  I would not desire much with her  for she is a good girl  and very housewifely  but if you will be so kind to give her something to set them a going a little  I shall be content  if not  you will be the cause of my son’s losing a wife  for he swears he will never marry any other woman  and she  poor thing  may pine away for love  I do not desire this match out of the ambition of having my boy related to you  but because I think the girl is an honest girl  and may make him happy   The rough honesty of the farmer pleased his landlord so well  that he gave the young woman five hundred pounds  to set them a going  as the old yeoman termed it  Though this sum was but a trifle to a man of his fortune  and the giving it was a praise worthy action  yet did it exceedingly displease his lady  especially as he had not thought proper to consult her on the occasion  She was not contented    with venting her indignation on her husband at home  but she renewed the quarrel  by complaining to lady Grimston  that her opinion and advice were not only despised  but that Sir William was lavishing away the fortune she had brought him upon a tribe of poor relations of his own  Lady Grimston immediately took fire  she could not bear the thoughts of having her daughter’s authority of less weight in his family  than her own had been  and she attacked her son in law with acrimony on the subject  His answer to her was short  Look ye  lady Grimston  you made a very obstreperous wife to a
