 and the loss of the English  in this unhappy surprize  amounted to seven hundred men  and the remainder of the army  some time after  returned to Philadelphia  It was in this manner the expedition of General Braddock terminated  from which England had expected such advantages  In all actions  that excite the applause and admiration of mankind  a part of their success is owing to conduct  and a part to fortune  Of the latter Braddock was totally forsaken  he was unsuccessful  and the ungrateful world are unwilling to grant him the former   Thus unfortunate were the beginnings of this war  with regard to England  it was resolved therefore  that no measures were now to be preserved with the   205 French  and orders were given to take their ships wherever found  though there was yet no formal declaration of war  With this order the naval commanders very readily and willingly complied  so that soon the English ports were filled with ships taken from the enemy  and kept as an indemnification for these forts which the enemy had unjustly possessed themselves of in America  The French complained loudly against the injustice of this proceeding  they represented it to the rest of Europe  as a breach of that faith which should be observed among nations  as a piratical measure  disgraceful to the most savage nation  Their memorials were answered by the English  with some shew of reason  However  it must be owned  that as a declaration of war was a ceremony easily performed  it would have been more consistent with the honour of the ministry  to have pursued the usual methods of contest which had been long established in Europe  The truth is  that the ministry were now divided between peace and war  they saw the necessity of vigorous measures  but they were afraid to throw off the mask of peace intirely  Henry Pelham  who had long guided at the helm of affairs with candour and capacity  had for some time been dead  and his place supplied by Sir Thomas Robinson  who  though a sensible minister  and a favourite of the King  was of no great weight in council  and  consequently  soon under a necessity of resigning  and Mr  Fox was put in his place  The administration was also new formed  in other respects  by the taking in several other new members  Those who had long been in the ministry  were  it is thought  for peace  those  on the contrary  who were newly taken into the direction of affairs  expected to supplant their rivals by an opposite system  and were consequently for war  The leader of this party  therefore  warmly solicited for war  seconded by the justice of the cause  and the general voice of   206 the people  those who opposed him expected to effect by negotiation whatever arms could atchieve  Whatever might have been the motives for protracting the declaration  the French seemed to convince Europe of their moderation upon this attack by sea  by neither declaring war  nor making any reprisals by sea  However  they threatened England with a formidable invasion  several bodies of troops moved to the coasts adjacent to ours  their ministers threatened loudly in foreign courts  and such preparations were made as shewed a resolution of carrying the war into the heart of Great Britain  These preparations had the desired effect  filling the nation with consternation  turbulence  and clamour  The people saw themselves exposed without arms  leaders  or discipline  while the ministry were timid  unpopular  and wavering  In this situation the Dutch were applied to for six thousand men  which  by treaty  they were to send England  in case of its being threatened with an invasion  Which demand  however  by affected delays  was put off so long  that the King  unwilling to come to an open rupture with the republic  desisted from it  for which they returned his Majesty thanks  Such are the advantages England is to expect  by relying on assistance from any other quarter than its native strength and unanimity  and every day seems to convince us of the absurdity of political alliances  which are never observed  as wanting friendship to bind  or force to compel   In this timid situation the ministry were eager to catch at any assistance  a body therefore of Hessians and Hanoverians  amounting to about ten thousand  were brought over to protect about as many millions of Englishmen  who  with swords in their hands  were able to defend themselves  but such was the vile complexion of this period  that the whole kingdom presented nothing but one picture of discontent    207 terror  and distrust of their leaders  The ministry was execrated for having reduced the nation to such circumstances of disgrace  as to be thought to stand in need of preservation from a few German mercenaries  but what could be expected from such a ministry  who were possessed neither of the arts  nor the integrity of government   However  the French were by no means serious in this intended descent  the only design was to draw off the attention of the English ministry from an expedition which was actually going forward against Minorca  an island in the Mediterranean  which we had formerly taken from Spain  and had been
