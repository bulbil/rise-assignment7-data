and I were out on a visit  But Mr  Reeves was at home  and they had a good deal of discourse about me  The worthy man spoke so despairingly of his success with me  that I hope  for his own sake  I shall hear no more of his addresses  and with the more reason  as Sir Rowland will in a few days set out for Caermarthen   Sir Rowland called afterwards  But Mr  Reeves was abroad  and Mrs  Reeves and I were gone to Ludgate hill  to buy a gown  which is to be made up in all haste  that I may the more fashionably attend Lady Betty Williams to some of the public entertainments  I have been very extravagant  But it is partly my cousin s fault  I send you inclosed a pattern of my silk  I thought we were high in the fashion in Northamptonshire  but all my cloaths are altering  that I may not look frightful  as the phrase is   But shall I as easily get rid of the Baronet  think you  as I hope I have of Mr  Fowler  He is come to town  and by his own invention  in a card to Mr  Reeves  is to be here to morrow afternoon  What signifies my getting out of the way  He will see me at another time  and I shall increase my own difficulties  and his consequence  if he thinks I am afraid of him     110  LETTER XVII  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   Wednesday Night   SIR Hargrave came before six o clock  He was richly dressed  He asked for Mr  Reeves  I was in my closet  writing  He was not likely to be the better received for the character Sir John Allestree gave of him   He excused himself for coming so early  on the score of his impatience  and that he might have a little discourse with them  if I should be engaged before tea time   Was I within —I was —Thank heaven —I was very good   So he seemed to imagine that I was at home  in compliment to him   Shall I give you  from my cousins  an account of the conversation before I went down  You know Mrs  Reeves is a nice observer   He had had  he told my cousins  a most uneasy time of it  ever since he saw me  The devil fetch him  if he had had one hour s rest  He never saw a woman before  whom he could love as he loved me  By his soul  he had no view  but what was strictly honourable   He sometimes sat down  sometimes walked about the room  strutting  and now and then adjusting something in his dress that nobody else saw wanted it  He gloried in the happy prospects before him  Not but he knew I had a little army of admirers  But as none of them had met with encouragement from me  he hoped there was room for him to flatter himself that he might be the happy man   I told you  Mr  Reeves  said he  that I will give you carte blanche as to settlements  What I do for   111 so prudent a woman  will be doing for myself  I am not used  Mr  Reeves  to boast of my fortune  Then  it seems  he went up to the glass  as if his person could not fail of being an additional recommendation  but I will lay before you  or before any of Miss Byron s friends  Mr  Deane  if she pleases—  my rent rolls  There never was a better conditioned estate  She shall live in town  or in the country  as she thinks fit  and in the latter  at which of my seats she pleases  I know I shall have no will but hers  I doubt not your friendship  Mr  Reeves  I hope for yours  madam  I shall have great pleasure in the alliance I have in view  with every individual of your family—As if he would satisfy them of his friendship  in the near relation  as the only matter that could bear a doubt   Then he ran on upon the part I bore in the conversation at Lady Betty Williams s—By his soul  only the wisest  the wittiest  the most gracefully modest of women—that was all—Then Ha  ha  ha  hah  poor Walden  What a silly fellow  He had caught a Tartar —Ha  ha  ha  hah—Shaking his head and his gay sides  Devil take him if ever he saw a Prig so fairly taken in —But I was a sly little rogue —He saw that —By all that s good  I must myself sing small in her company —I will never meet at hard edge with her—If I did— and yet I have been thought to carry a good one  I should be confoundedly gapped  I can see that  alluding to two knives  I suppose  gapping each other  and winking with one eye  and  as Mrs  Reeves described him  looking as wise as if he would make a compliment to his penetration  at the expence of his understanding   But  continued he
