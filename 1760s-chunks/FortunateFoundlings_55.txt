the former friendship between them  greatly added to the   contentment Horatio at present enjoyed  but soon after he received such   an augmentation of it  as he could never have imagined  much less have   flattered himself with the hope of       Some few days before his departure  a servant of the baron de Palfoy   came to him to let him know his lord sent his compliments  and desired   to speak with him at his own house  The message seemed so improbable    that Horatio could scarce give credit to it  and imagined the man had   been mistaken in the person to whom he delivered it  till he repeated   over and over again that it was to no other he was sent       Had it been any other than the father of mademoiselle Charlotta  who had   invited him to a house he had been once forbid  he scarce would have   obeyed the summons  but as it was he  the awful person who gave being to   that charmer of his soul  he sent the most respectful answer  and the   same day took horse for Paris  and attended the explanation of an order   which at present seemed so misterious to him       The baron was no sooner informed he was there  than he came into the   parlour with a countenance  which had in it all the marks of good humour   and satisfaction  Horatio  said he  after having made him seat himself    I doubt not but you think me your enemy  after the treatment I gave you   the last time you were here  but I assure you  I suffered no less myself   in forbidding you my house  than you could do in having what you might   think an affront put upon you   but  continued he after a pause  you   ought to consider I am a father  that Charlotta is my only child  that   my whole estate  and what is of infinite more consideration with me  the   honour of my family  must all devolve on her  and that I am under   obligations not to be dispensed with  to dispose of her in such a manner   as shall not any way degrade the ancestry she is sprung from   I own   your merits   I also am indebted to you for my life   but you are a   foreigner  your family unknown   your fortune precarious   I could wish   it were otherwise   believe  I find in myself an irresistable impulse to   love you  and I know nothing would give me greater pleasure than to   convince you of it   In fine  there is nothing but Charlotta I would   refuse you       The old lord uttered all this with so feeling an accent that Horatio was   very much moved at it  but unable to guess what would be the consequence   of this strange preparation  and not having any thing to ask of him but   the only thing he had declared he would not grant  he only thanked him   for the concern he was pleased to express  and said  that perhaps there   might come a time in which the obscurity he was in at present would be   enlightened  at least  cried he  I shall have the satisfaction of   endeavouring to acquire by merit what I am denied by fortune       I admire this noble ambition in you  replied the baron de Palfoy  pursue   these laudable views  and doubt not of success   it would be an infinite   pleasure to me to see you raised so high  that I should acknowledge an   alliance with you the greatest honour I could hope  and to shew you with   how much sincerity I speak   here is a letter I have wrote to count   Piper  the first minister and favourite of the king of Sweden  when you   deliver this to him  I am certain you will be convinced by his reception   of you  that you are one whose interest I take no inconsiderable   part in       With these words he gave him a letter directed  as he had said  but not   sealed  which Horatio  after he had manifested the sense he had of so   unhoped an obligation  reminded him of  As it concerns only yourself    said the baron  it is proper you should read it first  and I will then   put on my signet       Horatio on this unfolded it  and found it contained such high   commendations of him  and such pressing entreaties to that minister to   contribute all he could to his promotion  that it seemed rather dictated   by the fondness of a parent  than by one who had taken so much pains to   avoid being so  O  my lord  cried he  as soon as
