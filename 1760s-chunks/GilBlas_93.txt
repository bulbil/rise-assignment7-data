Arsenia s house  where Clarin had orders to attend  A little footboy opened the door  and showed us into a room down  stairs  where Arsenia s waiting woman  and the lady who held the same office about Florimonde  were laughing ready to split their sides  while their mistresses were above stairs with our masters   The addition of two jolly fellows just come from a good supper  could not be unwelcome to abigails  and to the abigails of actresses too  but what was my astonishment when in one of these lowly ladies I discovered my widow  my adorable widow  whom I took for a countess or a marchioness  She appeared equally amazed to see her dear Don Caesar de Ribera metamorphosed into the valet of a beau  However  we looked at one another without being out of countenance  indeed  such a tingling sensation of laughter came over us both  as we could not help indulging in  After which Laura  for that was her name  drawing me aside while Clarin was speaking to her fellow servant  held out her hand to me very kindly  and said in a low voice    Accept this pledge  Signor Don Caesar  mutual congratulations are more to the purpose than mutual reproaches  my friend  You topped your part to perfection  and I was not quite contemptible in mine  What say you  confess now  did not you take me for one of those precious peeresses who are fond of a little smuggled amusement  It is even so  answered I  but whoever you are  my empress  I have not changed my sentiments with my paraphernalia  Accept my services in good part  and let the valet de chambre of Don Matthias consummate what Don Caesar has so happily begun  Get you gone  replied she  I like you ten times better in your natural than in your artificial character  You are as a man what I am as a woman  and that is the greatest compliment I can pay you  You are admitted into the number of my adorers  We have no longer any need of the old woman as a blind  you may come and see me whenever you like  We theatrical ladies are no slaves to form  but live higgledy  piggledy with the men  I allow that the effects are sometimes visible  but the public wink hard at our irregularities  the drama s patrons  as you well know  give the drama s laws  and absolve us from all others   We went no further  because there were bystanders  The conversation be came general  lively  jovial  inclining to loose jokes  not very carefully wrapped up  We all of us bore a bob  Arsenia s attendant above all  my amiable Laura  was very conspicuous  but her wit was so extremely nimble  that her virtue could never overtake it  Our masters and the actresses on the floor above  raised incessant peals of laughter  which reached us in the regions below  and probably the entertainment was much alike with the celestials and the infernals  If all the knowing remarks had been written down  which escaped from the philosophers that night assembled at Arsenia s  I really think it would have been a manual for the rising generation  Yet we could not arrest the chaste moon in her progress  the rising of that blab  the sun  parted us  Clarin followed the heels of Don Alexo  and I went home with Don Matthias       CH  VI     The Prince s company of comedians   My master getting up the next day  received a note from Don Alexo Segiar  desiring his company immediately  We went  and found there the Marquis de Zenette  and another young nobleman of prepossessing manners  whom I had never seen  Don Matthias  said Segiar to my protector  introducing the stranger  give me leave to present Don Pompeyo de Castro  a relation of mine  He has been at the court of Portugal almost from his childhood  He reached Madrid last night  and returns to Lisbon to morrow  He can allow me only one day  I wish to make the most of the precious moments  and thought of asking you and the Marquis de Zenette to make out the time agreeably  Thereupon my master and Don Alexo s relation embraced heartily  and complimented one an other in the most extravagant manner  I was much pleased with Don Pompeyo s conversation  it showed both acuteness and solidity   They dined with Segiar  and the gentlemen  after the dessert  amused themselves at play till the theatre opened  Then they went all together to the Prince s House  to see a new tragedy  called The Queen of Carthage  At the end of the piece they returned to supper  and their conversation ran first on the composition  then upon the actors  As for the work  cried Don Matthias  I think very lightly of it  Eneas is a more pious blockhead there than in the Eneid  But it must be owned that the piece was played divinely  What does Signor Don Pompeyo think of it  He does not seem to agree with me  Gentlemen  said the illustrious stranger with a smile  you are so enraptured with your actors  and still more
