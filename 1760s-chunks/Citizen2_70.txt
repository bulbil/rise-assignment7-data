and had my meat and drink provided for my labour  It is true  I was not suffered to stir far from the house  for fear I should run away  but what of that  I had the liberty of the whole house  and the yard before the door  and that was enough for me   I was next bound out to a farmer  where I was up both early and late  but I ate and drank well  and liked my business well enough  till he died  Being then obliged to provide for myself  I was resolved to go and seek my fortune  Thus I lived  and went from town to town  working when I could get employment  and starving when I could get none  and might have lived so still  But happening one day to go through a field belonging to a magistrate  I spy d a hare crossing   219 the path just before me  I believe the devil put it in my head to fling my stick at it  well  what will you have on t  I killed the hare  and was bringing it away in triumph  when the justice himself met me  he called me a villain  and collaring me  desired I would give an account of myself  I began immediately to give a full account of all that I knew of my breed  seed  and generation  but though I gave a very long account  the justice said  I could give no account of myself  so I was indicted  and found guilty of being poor  and sent to Newgate  in order to be transported to the plantations   People may say this and that of being in jail  but for my part  I found Newgate as agreeable a place as ever I was in  in all my life  I had my belly full to eat and drink  and did no work  but alas  this kind of life was too good to last for ever  I was taken out of prison  after five months  put on board of a ship  and sent off with two hundred more  Our passage was but indifferent  for we were all confined in the hold  and died very fast  for want of sweet air and provisions  but for my part  I did not want meat  because I had a fever all the way  providence was kind  when provisions grew short  it took away my desire of eating  When we came ashore  we were sold to the planters  I was bound for seven years  and as I was no scholar  for I had forgot my letters  I was obliged to work among the negroes  and served out my time  as in duty bound to do   When my time was expired  I worked my passage home  and glad I was to see Old England   220 again  because I loved my country  O liberty  liberty  liberty  that is the property of every Englishman  and I will die in its defence  I was afraid  however  that I should be indicted for a vagabond once more  so did not much care to go into the country  but kept about town  and did little jobs when I could get them  I was very happy in this manner for some time  till one evening  coming home from work  two men knocked me down  and then desired me to stand still  They belonged to a press gang  I was carried before the justice  and as I could give no account of my self   that was the thing that always hobbled me   I had my choice left  whether to go on board a man of war  or list for a soldier  I chose to be a soldier  and in this post of a gentleman I served two campaigns  was at the battles in Flanders  and received but one wound through the breast  which is troublesome to this day   When the peace came on  I was discharged  and as I could not work  because my wound was sometimes painful  I listed for a landman in the East India company s service  I here fought the French in six pitched battles  and verily believe  that if I could read or write  our captain would have given me promotion  and made me a corporal  But that was not my good fortune  I soon fell sick  and when I became good for nothing  got leave to return home again with forty pounds in my pocket  which I saved in the service  This was at the beginning of the present war  so I hoped to be set on shore  and to have the pleasure of spending my money  but the government wanted men  and I was   221 pressed again  before ever I could set foot on shore   The boatswain found me  as he said  an obstinate fellow  he swore that I understood my business perfectly well  but that I pretended sickness merely to be idle  God knows  I knew nothing of sea business  He beat me without considering what he was about  But still my forty pounds  was some comfort to me under every beating  the money was my comfort  and the money I might have
