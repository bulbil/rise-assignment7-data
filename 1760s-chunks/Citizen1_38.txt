doctor Nonentity  a metaphysician  Most people think him a profound scholar  but as he seldom speaks  I cannot be positive in that particular  he generally spreads himself before the fire  sucks his pipe  talks little  drinks much  and is reckoned very good company  I m told he writes indexes to perfection  he makes essays on the origin of evil  philosophical enquiries upon any subject  and draws up an answer to any book upon twenty four hours warning  You may distinguish him from the rest of the company by his long grey wig  and the blue handkerchief round his neck     118The next to him in merit and esteem is Tim Syllabub  a drole creature  he sometimes shines as a star of the first magnitude among the choice spirits of the age  he is reckoned equally excellent at a rebus  a riddle  a baudy song  and an hymn for the tabernacle  You will know him by his shabby finery  his powdered wig  dirty shirt  and broken silk stockings   After him succeeds Mr  Tibs  a very useful hand  he writes receipts for the bite of a mad dog  and throws off an eastern tale to perfection  he understands the business of an author as well as any man  for no bookseller alive can cheat him  you may distinguish him by the peculiar clumsiness of his figure and the coarseness of his coat  however  though it be coarse   as he frequently tells the company  he has paid for it   Lawyer Squint is the politician of the society  he makes speeches for parliament  writes addresses to his fellow subjects  and letters to noble commanders  he gives the history of every new play  and finds seasonable thoughts upon every occasion —My companion was proceeding in his description  when the host came running in with terror on his countenance to tell us  that the door was beset with bailiffs  If that be the case then  says my companion  we had as good be going  for I am positive we shall not see one of the company this night  Wherefore disappointed we were both obliged to return home  he to enjoy the oddities which compose his character alone  and I to write as usual to my friend the occurrences of the day  Adieu     119  LETTER XXIX  From the same   BY my last advices from Moscow  I find the caravan has not yet departed for China  I still continue to write  expecting that you may receive a large number of my letters at once  In them you will find rather a minute detail of English peculiarities  than a general picture of their manners or disposition  Happy it were for mankind if all travellers would thus  instead of characterising a people in general terms  lead us into a detail of those minute circumstances which first influenced their opinion  the genius of a country should be investigated with a kind of experimental enquiry  by this means we should have more precise and just notions of foreign nations  and detect travellers themselves when they happened to form wrong conclusions   My friend and I repeated our visit to the club of authors  where  upon our entrance  we found the members all assembled and engaged in a loud debate   The poet  in shabby finery  holding a manuscript in his hand  was earnestly endeavouring to persuade the company to hear him read the first book of an heroic poem  which he had composed the day before  But against this  all the members very warmly objected  They knew no reason why any member of the club should be indulged with a particular hearing  when many of them had published whole volumes which had never been looked   120 in  They insisted that the law should be observed  where reading in company was expresly noticed  It was in vain that the plaintiff pleaded the peculiar merit of his piece  he spoke to an assembly insensible to all his remonstrances  the book of laws was opened  and read by the secretary  where it was expresly enacted     That whatsoever poet  speechmaker  critic  or historian  should presume to engage the company by reading his own works  he was to lay down sixpence previous to opening the manuscript  and should be charged one shilling an hour while he continued reading  the said shilling to be equally distributed among the company as a recompence for their trouble      Our poet seemed at first to shrink at the penalty  hesitating for some time whether he should deposit the fine  or shut up the poem  but looking round  and perceiving two strangers in the room  his love of fame out weighed his prudence  and laying down the sum by law established  he insisted on his prerogative   A profound silence ensuing  he began by explaining his design   Gentlemen  says he  the present piece is not one of your common epic poems  which come from the press like paper kites in summer  there are none of your Turnuses or Dido s in it  it is an heroical description of nature  I only beg you ll endeavour to make your souls unison with mine  and hear with the same enthusiasm with which I have written  The poem begins with the description of an
