 he would order his man to punish  his audacity with a horsewhip  Exasperated at this expression  which he  considered as an indelible affront  he made no reply  but attacked his  adversary with equal ferocity and address  The youth parried his  first and second thrust  but received the third in the outside of his  sword arm  Though the wound was superficial  he was transported with  rage at sight of his own blood  and returned the assault with such  fury and precipitation  that Gauntlet  loath to take advantage of  his unguarded heat  stood upon the defensive  In the second lounge   Peregrine s weapon entering a kind of network in the shell of Godfrey s  sword  the blade snapped in two  and left him at the mercy of the  soldier  who  far from making an insolent use of the victory he had  gained  put up his Toledo with great deliberation  like a man who had  been used to that kind of reencounters  and observed that such a blade  as Peregrine s was not to be trusted with a man s life  then advising    6 22 15  3 45 PM   the owner to treat a gentleman in distress with more respect for the  future  he slipped on his boots  and with sullen dignity of demeanour  stalked back to the inn   Though Pickle was extremely mortified at his miscarriage in this  adventure  he was also struck with the behaviour of his antagonist   which affected him the more  as he understood that Godfrey s fierte had  proceeded from the jealous sensibility of a gentleman declined into the  vale of misfortune  Gauntlet s valour and moderation induced him to  put a favourable construction on all those circumstances of that young  soldier s conduct  which before had given him disgust  Though in any  other case he would have industriously avoided the least appearance of  submission  he followed his conqueror to the inn with a view of thanking  him for his generous forbearance  and of soliciting his friendship and  correspondence   Godfrey had his foot in the stirrup to mount  when Peregrine  coming up  to him  desired he would defer his departure for a quarter of an hour   and favour him with a little private conversation  The soldier  who  mistook the meaning of the request  immediately quitted his horse  and  followed Pickle into a chamber  where he expected to find a brace of  pistols loaded on the table  but he was very agreeably deceived   when our hero  in the most respectful terms  acknowledged his noble  deportment in the field  owned that till then he had misunderstood his  character  and begged that he would honour him with his intimacy and  correspondence   Gauntlet  who had seen undoubted proofs of Peregrine s courage  which  had considerably raised him in his esteem  and had sense enough to  perceive that this concession was not owing to any sordid or sinister  motive  embraced his offer with demonstrations of infinite satisfaction   When he understood the terms on which Mr  Pickle was with his sister   he proffered his service in his turn  either as agent  mediator  or  confidant  nay  to give this new friend a convincing proof of his  sincerity  he disclosed to him a passion which he had for some time  entertained for his cousin Miss Sophy  though he durst not reveal his  sentiments to her father  lest he should be offended at his presumption   and withdraw his protection from the family   Peregrine s generous heart was wrung with anguish  when he understood  that this young gentleman  who was the only son of a distinguished  officer  had carried arms for the space of five years  without being  able to obtain a subaltern s commission  though he always had behaved  with remarkable regularity and spirit  and  acquired the friendship and  esteem of all the officers under whom he had served  He would  at that  time  with the utmost pleasure  have shared his finances with him  but  as he would not run the risk of offending the young soldier s delicacy  of honour by a premature exertion of his liberality  he resolved to  insinuate himself into an intimacy with him  before he would venture to  take such freedoms  and with that view pressed Mr  Gauntlet to accompany  him to the garrison  where he did not doubt of having influence enough  to make him a welcome guest  Godfrey thanked him very courteously for  his invitation  which he said he could not immediately accept  but  promised  if he would favour him with a letter  and fix the time at  which he proposed to set out for France  he would endeavour to visit  him at the commodore s habitation  and from thence give him a convoy to  Dover  This new treaty being settled  and a dossil of lint  with a    6 22 15  3 45 PM   snip of plaster  applied to our adventurer s wound  he parted from the  brother of his dear Emilia  to whom and his friend Sophy he sent his  kindest
