want of it —He stared in my face  with a woful countenance  at this declaration  which he would scarce believe  until I explained it  by unbuttoning my coat  and disclosing my naked body  a circumstance that shocked the tender hearted Strap  who  with tears in his eyes  run to a chest of drawers  and taking out some linen  presented to me a very fine ruffled holland shirt  and cambrick neckcloth  assuring me  he had three dozen of the same kind at my service —I was ravished at this piece of good news  and having accommodated myself in a moment  hugged my benefactor for his generous offer  saying  I was overjoyed to find him undebauched by prosperity  which seldom fails of corrupting the heart  He bespoke for dinner  some soup and   74 boillé  a couple of pullets roasted  and a dish of sparrowgrass  and in the interim entertained me with biscuit and Burgundy  after which he entreated me to gratify his longing desire of knowing every circumstance of my fortune since his departure from London —This I complyed with  beginning at the adventure of Gawky  and relating every particular event in which I had been concerned from that day to the present hour  During the recital  my friend was strongly affected  according to the various situations described  He started with surprize  glowed with indignation  gaped with curiosity  smiled with pleasure  trembled with fear  and wept with sorrow  as the vicissitudes of my life inspired these different passions  and when my story was ended  signified his amazement on the whole  by lifting up his eyes and hands  and protesting  that tho  I was a young man  I had suffered more than all the blessed martyrs     After dinner  I desired  in my turn  to know the particulars of his peregrination  and he satisfied me in a few words  by giving me to understand that he had lived a year at Paris with his master  who  in that time  having acquired the language  as well as the fashionable exercises  to perfection  made a tour of France and Holland  during which excursion  he was so unfortunate as to meet with three of his own countrymen on their travels  in whose company he committed such excesses  that his constitution failed  and he fell into a consumption  that by the advice of physicians he went to Montpelier for the benefit of good air  and recovered so well in six weeks  that he returned to Rheims  seemingly in good health  where he had not continued above a   75 month  when he was seized with a looseness  that carried him off in ten days  to the unspeakable sorrow of all who knew him  and especially of Strap  who had been very happy in his service  and given such satisfaction  that his master on his death bed  recommended him to several persons of distinction  for his diligence  sobriety  and affection  and left him by will  his wearing apparel  gold watch  sword  rings  ready money  and all the moveables he had in France  to the value of three hundred pounds     which I now  said he  in the sight of God and man  surrender to your absolute disposal  Here are my keys  take them  I beseech you  and God give you joy of the possession  —  My brain was almost turned with this sudden change of fortune  which I could scarce believe real  however  I positively refused this extravagant proffer of my friend  and put him in mind of my being a soldier  at which he started  crying    Odso  that s true—we must procure your discharge—I have some interest with a nobleman who is able to do me that favour  —  We consulted about this affair  and it was determined  that Monsieur d Estrapes  should wait upon the Marquis in the morning  and tell him he had by accident found his brother  whom he had not seen for many years before  a private soldier in the regiment of Picardle  and implore that nobleman s interest for his discharge —In the mean time  we enjoyed ourselves over a bottle of good Burgundy  and spent the evening in concerting schemes for our future conduct  in case I should be so lucky as to get rid of the army —The business was to make ourselves easy for life  by means of his legacy  a task very difficult  and  in the usual methods of laying out   76 money  altogether impracticable  so that after much canvasing  we could come to no resolution that night  but when we parted  recommended the matter to the serious attention of each other  As for my own part  I puzzled my imagination to no purpose  when I thought of turning merchant  the smallness of our stock  and the risk of seas  enemies and markets  deterred me from that scheme —If I should settle as a surgeon in my own country  I would find the business already overstocked  or if I pretended to set up in England  must labour under want of friends and powerful opposition  obstacles unsurmountable by the most shining merit  neither would I succeed in my endeavours to rise in the state
