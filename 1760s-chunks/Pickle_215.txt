 and  by a violent shake of the shoulder   disengaged him from the arms of sleep  The first compliments having  mutually passed  Cadwallader gave him to understand  that he had arrived  in town overnight in the stage coach from Bath  and entertained him with  such a ludicrous account of his fellow travellers  that Peregrine  for  the first time since their parting  indulged himself in mirth  even to  the hazard of suffocation   Crabtree  having rehearsed these adventures  in such a peculiarity of  manner as added infinite ridicule to every circumstance  and repeated  every scandalous report which had circulated at Bath  after Peregrine s  departure  was informed by the youth  that he harboured a design upon  the person of such a duchess  and in all appearance had no reason to  complain of his reception  but that he would not venture to declare  himself  until he should be more ascertained of her sentiments  and  therefore he begged leave to depend upon the intelligence of his friend  Cadwallader  who  he knew  was admitted to her parties   The misanthrope  before he would promise his assistance  asked if his  prospect verged towards matrimony  and our adventurer  who guessed the  meaning of his question  replying in the negative  he undertook the  office of reconnoitring her inclination  protesting at the same time   that he would never concern himself in any scheme that did not tend  to the disgrace and deception of all the sex  On these conditions he  espoused the interest of our hero  and a plan was immediately concerted     6 22 15  3 45 PM   in consequence of which they met by accident at her grace s table   Pickle having staid all the forepart of the evening  and sat out all the  company  except the misanthrope and a certain widow lady who was said  to be in the secrets of my lady duchess  went away on pretence of an  indispensable engagement  that Crabtree might have a proper opportunity  of making him the subject of conversation   Accordingly  he had scarce quitted the apartment  when this cynic   attending him to the door with a look of morose disdain   Were I an  absolute prince   said he   and that fellow one of my subjects  I would  order him to be clothed in sackcloth  and he should drive my asses  to water  that his lofty spirit might be lowered to the level of his  deserts  The pride of a peacock is downright self denial  when compared  with the vanity of that coxcomb  which was naturally arrogant  but is  now rendered altogether intolerable  by the reputation he acquired at  Bath  for kicking a bully  outwitting a club of raw sharpers  and divers  other pranks  in the execution of which he was more lucky than wise   But nothing has contributed so much to the increase of his insolence and  self conceit  as the favour he found among the ladies  ay  the ladies   madam  I care not who knows it  the ladies  who  to their honour be it  spoken  never fail to patronize foppery and folly  provided they solicit  their encouragement  And yet this dog was not on the footing of those  hermaphroditical animals  who may be reckoned among the number of  waiting women  who air your shifts  comb your lap dogs  examine your  noses with magnifying glasses  in order to squeeze out the worms  clean  your tooth brushes  sweeten your handkerchiefs  and soften waste  paper for your occasions  This fellow Pickle was entertained for more  important purposes  his turn of duty never came till all those lapwings  were gone to roost  then he scaled windows  leaped over garden walls   and was let in by Mrs  Betty in the dark  Nay  the magistrates of Bath  complimented him with the freedom of the corporation  merely because   through his means  the waters had gained extraordinary credit  for every  female of a tolerable appearance  that went thither on account of her  sterility  got the better of her complaint  during his residence at  Bath  And now the fellow thinks no woman can withstand his addresses   He had not been here three minutes  when I could perceive  with half  an eye  that he had marked out your grace for a conquest   I mean in  an honourable way  though the rascal has impudence enough to attempt  anything    So saying  he fixed his eyes upon the duchess  who  while her face  glowed with indignation  turning to her confidant  expressed herself in  these words   Upon my life  I believe there is actually some truth in  what this old ruffian says  I have myself observed that young fellow  eyeing me with a very particular stare     It is not to be at all  wondered at   said her friend   that a youth of his complexion should  be sensible to the charms of your grace  but I dare say he would  not presume to entertain any but the
