families may  from the odious character   of Mrs  JEWKES  and the amiable ones of Mrs  JERVIS  Mr  LONGMAN  etc    learn what to avoid  and what to choose  to make themselves valued and   esteemed by all who know them       And  from the double conduct of poor JOHN  the LOWER SERVANTS may   learn fidelity  and how to distinguish between the lawful and unlawful   commands of a superior       The poor deluded female  who  like the once unhappy Miss GODFREY  has   given up her honour  and yielded to the allurements of her designing   lover  may learn from her story  to stop at the first fault  and  by   resolving to repent and amend  see the pardon and blessing which await   her penitence  and a kind Providence ready to extend the arms of its   mercy to receive and reward her returning duty  While the prostitute    pursuing the wicked courses  into which  perhaps  she was at first   inadvertently drawn  hurries herself into filthy diseases  and an   untimely death  and  too probably  into everlasting perdition       Let the desponding heart be comforted by the happy issue which the   troubles and trials of PAMELA met with  when they see  in her case    that no danger nor distress  however inevitable  or deep to their   apprehensions  can be out of the power of Providence to obviate or   relieve  and which  as in various instances in her story  can turn   the most seemingly grievous things to its own glory  and the reward of   suffering innocence  and that too  at a time when all human prospects   seem to fail       Let the rich  and those who are exalted from a low to a high estate    learn from her  that they are not promoted only for a single good  but   that Providence has raised them  that they should dispense to all within   their reach  the blessings it has heaped upon them  and that the greater   the power is to which God hath raised them  the greater is the good that   will be expected from them       From the low opinion she every where shews of herself  and her   attributing all her excellencies to pious education  and her lady s   virtuous instructions and bounty  let persons  even of genius and piety    learn not to arrogate to themselves those gifts and graces  which they   owe least of all to themselves  Since the beauties of person are frail    and it is not in our power to give them to ourselves  or to be either   prudent  wise  or good  without the assistance of divine grace       From the same good example  let children see what a blessing awaits   their duty to their parents  though ever so low in the world  and that   the only disgrace  is to be dishonest  but none at all to be poor       From the economy she purposes to observe in her elevation  let even   ladies of condition learn  that there are family employments  in which   they may and ought to make themselves useful  and give good examples to   their inferiors  as well as equals  and that their duty to God    charity to the poor and sick  and the different branches of household   management  ought to take up the most considerable portions of their   time       From her signal veracity  which she never forfeited  in all the   hardships she was tried with  though her answers  as she had reason to   apprehend  would often make against her  and the innocence she preserved   throughout all her stratagems and contrivances to save herself from   violation  Persons  even sorely tempted  may learn to preserve a sacred   regard to truth  which always begets a reverence for them  even in the   corruptest minds              In short           Her obliging behaviour to her equals  before her exaltation  her         kindness to them afterwards  her forgiving spirit  and her         generosity           Her meekness  in every circumstance where her virtue was not         concerned           Her charitable allowances for others  as in the case of Miss         Godfrey  for faults she would not have forgiven in herself           Her kindness and prudence to the offspring of that melancholy         adventure
