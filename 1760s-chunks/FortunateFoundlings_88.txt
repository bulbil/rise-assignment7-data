that he travelled almost night and day  already imitating the   example of the master he was going to serve  no wood  no river was   impassable to him that shortened the distance to the place he so much   longed to approach  and thus by inuring himself to hardship  became   fitly qualified to bear his part in all the vast fatigues to which that   prince incessantly exposed his royal person       Not a city  town  or even village he puffed thro   but echoed with the   wonders performed by the young king of Sweden   new victories  new   acquisitions met him wherever he came   all tongues were full of his   praises  and even those who had been ruined by his conquests  could not   help speaking of him with admiration   Horatio heard all this with   pleasure  but mixed with a kind of pain that he was not present at these   great actions   How glorious is it  cried he to himself  to fight under   the banners of this invincible monarch   What immortal honour has not   every private man acquired  who contributed the least part to successes   that astonish the whole world       But notwithstanding his eagerness which carried him thro  marshes  over   mountains  and ways  which to an ordinary traveller would have seemed   impassable  he met with several delays in his journey  especially when   he got into Germany  where they were extremely scrupulous  and he was   obliged to wait at some towns two or three days before he could obtain   passports  he also met several parties of flying horse and dragoons  who   were scouting about the country  as he drew nearer Saxony  but his   policy furnished him with stratagems to get over these difficulties  and   he got safe to Punitz  in the Palatinate of Posnania  where a great part   of the king of Sweden s army was encamped   He immediately demanded to   be brought to the presence of the grand marshal Renchild  to whom he   delivered the letter of the baron de la Valiere  and found the good   effects of it by the civilities with which that great general vouchsafed   to treat him  He would have had him stay with him  but Horatio  knowing   the king was at Warsaw  was too impatient of seeing that monarch to be   prevailed upon  on which he sent a party of horse to escort him to   that city       He had the good fortune to arrive on the very day that Stanislaus and   his queen were crowned  and was witness of part of the ceremony  The   king of Sweden was there incognito  and being shewn to Horatio  he could   not forbear testifying his surprize to see so great a prince  and one   who  in every action of his life  discovered a magnamity even above his   rank  habited in a manner not to be distinguished from a private man    but it was not in the power of any garb to take from him a look of   majesty  which shewed him born to command not only his own subjects  but   kings themselves  when they presumed to become his enemies  There was a   fierceness in his eyes  but tempered with so much sweetness  that it was   impossible for those who most trembled at his frowns to avoid loving him   at the same time       Stanislaus had in him all that could attract respect and good wishes    beside the most graceful person that can be imagined  he had a certain   air of grandeur  joined with an openness of behaviour  that shewed him   equally incapable of doing a mean or dishonourable action  his queen was   one of the greatest beauties of her time  and every one present at their   coronation  confessed  that never any two persons more became a throne    or were more worthy of the dignity conferred upon them       The whole court was too much taken up that day  for Horatio to think of   presenting himself before the king of Sweden  but the officer  who   commanded the party that general Renchild had sent with him  introduced   him in the evening to count Hoorn  governor of Warsaw  who provided him   an appartment  and the next morning introduced him to count Piper  That   minister no sooner read the baron de Palfoy s letter  and heard he had   others to deliver to the king from the chevalier St  George  and the   queen dowager of England  than he treated him with the utmost marks of   esteem  and assured him that  since he had an inclination to serve his   majesty  he would contribute every thing in his power to make him not   repent the long fatigues he had undergone for that purpose  but  said he   with
