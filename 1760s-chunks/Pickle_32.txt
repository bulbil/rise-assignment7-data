usher had found means to inspire him  but  he by no means preserved the same regard for the principal master  an  old illiterate German quack  who had formerly practised corn cutting  among the quality  and sold cosmetic washes to the ladies  together with  teeth powders  hair dyeing liquors  prolific elixirs  and tinctures to  sweeten the breath  These nostrums  recommended by the art of cringing   in which he was consummate  ingratiated him so much with people of  fashion  that he was enabled to set up school with five and twenty boys  of the best families  whom he boarded on his own terms and undertook to  instruct in the French and Latin languages  so as to qualify them  for the colleges of Westminster and Eton  While this plan was in its  infancy  he was so fortunate as to meet with Jennings  who  for the  paltry consideration of thirty pounds a year  which his necessities  compelled him to accept  took the whole trouble of educating the  children upon himself  contrived an excellent system for that purpose   and  by his assiduity and knowledge  executed all the particulars to the  entire satisfaction of those concerned  who  by the bye  never inquired  into his qualifications  but suffered the other to enjoy the fruits of  his labour and ingenuity   Over and above a large stock of avarice  ignorance  and vanity  this  superior had certain ridiculous peculiarities in his person  such as  a hunch upon his back  and distorted limbs  that seemed to attract the  satirical notice of Peregrine  who  young as he was  took offence at  his want of reverence for his usher  over whom he sometimes chose  opportunities of displaying his authority  that the boys might not  misplace their veneration  Mr  Keypstick  therefore  such as I    6 22 15  3 45 PM   have described him  incurred the contempt and displeasure of this  enterprising pupil  who now being in the tenth year of his age  had  capacity enough to give him abundance of vexation  He underwent many  mortifying jokes front the invention of Pickle and his confederates  so  that he began to entertain suspicion of Mr  Jennings  who he could  not help thinking had been at the bottom of them all  and spirited up  principles of rebellion in the school  with a view of making himself  independent  Possessed with this chimera  which was void of all  foundation  the German descended so low as to tamper in private with the  boys  from whom he hoped to draw some very important discovery  but he  was disappointed in his expectations  and this mean practice reaching  the ears of his usher  he voluntarily resigned his employment  Finding  interest to obtain holy orders in a little time after  he left  the kingdom  hoping to find a settlement in some of our American  plantations   The departure of Mr  Jennings produced a great revolution in the affairs  of Keypstick  which declined from that moment  because he had neither  authority to enforce obedience  nor prudence to maintain order among his  scholars  so that the school degenerated into anarchy and confusion  and  he himself dwindled in the opinion of his employers  who looked upon him  as superannuated  and withdrew their children front his tuition   Peregrine seeing this dissolution of their society  and finding himself  every day deprived of some companion  began to repine at his situation   and resolved  if possible  to procure his release from the jurisdiction  of the person whom he both detested and despised  With this view he went  to work  and composed the following billet  addressed to the commodore   which was the first specimen of his composition in the epistolary way          Honoured and Loving Uncle   Hoping you are in good health       this serves to inform you  that Mr  Jennings is gone  and      Mr  Keypstick will never meet with his fellow  The school      is already almost broke up  and the rest daily going away       and I beg of you of all love to have me fetched away also       for I cannot bear to be any longer under one who is a perfect      ignoramus  who scarce knows the declination of musa  and is      more fit to be a scarecrow than a schoolmaster  hoping you      will send for me soon  with my love to my aunt  and my duty      to my honoured parents  craving their blessing and yours  And      this is all at present from  honoured uncle  your well beloved      and dutiful nephew and godson  and humble servant to command      till death                                 Peregrine Pickle
