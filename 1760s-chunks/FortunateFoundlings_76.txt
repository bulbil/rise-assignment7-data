great deal of discourse  monsieur du   Plessis heard of it the next day related after different fashions  The   concern he was in was conformable to the passion he had for the fair   occasion  and both beyond what is ordinarily to be found in persons of   his sex  Impatient to know the truth he went to Melanthe s  and she   happening to be abroad  he desired to speak to Louisa  but was told she   was indisposed  and could see no company  These orders had been given by   Melanthe  but were very agreeable to Louisa herself  who desired to   avoid the sight of every one she had conversed with in a different   manner from what she could now expect  but of the whole world this   gentleman she most wished to shun       He concealed the trouble he was in as well as he was able  and affecting   a careless air  told the person who answered him  that he only came to   ask if she had heard the last new song  and that he would send it   to her       The moment he came home he sat down and wrote the following billet        To the ever charming  LOUISA        That invincible bar you mentioned  yet   made so great a secret of  is at last revealed    and I should be unworthy of the blessing I aspire   to  if I were unable to surmount it    Cruel Louisa  you little know me  or the force   of that passion you have inspired  to imagine   that any difference which chance may have put   between us  can make the least alteration in my   sentiments   It is to your own perfections I   have devoted my heart  not to the merit or   grandeur of your ancestors  What has my love   to do with fortune  or with family   Does a   diamond lose any thing of its intrinsic value for   being presented by an unknown  or an obscure   hand   My eyes convince me of the charms   of my adored Louisa  my understanding shews   me those of her mind  and if heaven vouchsafes   to bless me with so rich a jewel  I never shall   examine whence it came   If therefore I am   not so unhappy as to be hated by you  let not   vain punctilloes divide us  and  as the first proof   of my inviolable passion  permit me to remove   you from a place where you have met with such   unworthy treatment   I hope you wrong me   not so far as to suspect I any other designs   on you than such as are consistent with the   strictest honour  but to prevent all scruples of   that nature from entering your gentle breast  I   would wish to place you in a convent  the   choice of which shall be your own  provided it   may be where I sometimes may be allowed to   pay my vows to you thro  the grate  till time   shall have sufficiently proved my fidelity  and   you shall prevail on yourself to recempence my   flame  by bestowing on me your hand and heart   the   one I would not ask without the other    but both together would render the happiest of   mankind        Your eternally devoted       Du Plessis        P S   As I perceive it will be next to an impossibility   to gain a sight of you while you continue   with that ungenerous woman  I entreat   to know by a line how I stand in your opinion    and if the offers I make you  in the sincerity   of my soul  may be thought worthy   your acceptance           This epistle he ordered his valet de chambre to give to her own hand  if   there were a possibility of it  and the fellow so well executed his   commission  being acquainted with Melanthe s servants  that he was   carried directly up to her chamber  She was a little surprized to see   him  because she knew it was contrary to Melanthe s commands that any   one should see her  and doubted not but to find she was treated with any   kind of respect  would enhance her ill humour to her  But she said   nothing that discovered her sentiments on this point  and with all the   appearance of a perfect ease of mind  asked what he had to deliver to   her  Only a song  mademoiselle  answered he  which my master ordered me   to give you  and to desire you will let him know how you like it   he   says it might be turned into
