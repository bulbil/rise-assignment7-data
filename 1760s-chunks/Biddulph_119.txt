law suit went on  I answered  it had been determined some days ago  and we had lost our cause  He turned pale at the news  Good God  what an unfortunate man your husband is  said he  What will become of him     He put an end to his visit immediately  telling me  that either he or his lady would call on me in the afternoon  to let me know the result of their conference with Mr Arnold   I flew to my mother  to tell her the joyful news  She offered up a prayer that it might turn out as my lord V—— had suggested  and said  she herself was of the same opinion   With a heart elated with pleasure  my dear Cecilia  I have scribbled over the occurrences of this morning  God grant I may be able to close my journal of to day with the happy wished for event   I never counted the clock with such impatience as I did this day  waiting the promised visit of lord or lady V——  and I ordered myself to be denied to all company but them  At one o’clock good lady V—— came  without my lord  When I heard the rap at the door  and saw from the window it was her equipage  I was seized with such a trembling  that when lady V——  who hurried up stairs  entered the room  I was unable to speak  or salute her  She ran up to me  and taking me by the hand  affectionately embraced me  My mother was present  I made a shift to present her to lady V——  She then led me to a chair  and sat down by me  Come  my dear Mrs Arnold  said she  recover your spirits  all will be well  I began to apologize for giving her ladyship the trouble of coming to me  when it was my duty to have waited on her  Do not mention ceremony  said she  I was in too much haste to bring you good news  to think of forms  We have had Mr Arnold with us till within this half hour  and indeed he more deserves your pity now than your resentment   Oh  I feared it  said I  and tears started into my eyes  If you are so affected at the barely knowing this  said my lady  I must not tell you the particulars of our conversation  it will be enough for you to know  that your husband is convinced of the injuries he has done you  and desires nothing more than your forgiveness   Dear lady V——  said I  excuse me  my heart is really so softened by sorrow  that I cannot command my tears  But I beg that may not deter you from indulging me with the particulars of what passed between you and Mr Arnold  If I do weep  as my tears no longer proceed from grief  do not let them interrupt you   My mother joined in begging lady V—— to inform us of all that passed in that morning’s interview   Lady V—— obligingly complied  and gave the following account of it   Mr Arnold came exactly at ten o’clock  my lord was just returned from his visit to you  and had got in but a few minutes before him     Poor Mr Arnold looked abashed upon seeing me  his countenance and his voice discovered the humiliation of his mind  After the first compliments were over  we sat down to breakfast  your husband drank a dish of coffee  but eat nothing  We were in haste  that the servants should leave the room  and dismissed them as soon as we could  My lord then opened the conversation  by saying  ‘Well  Arnold  here are lady V—— and I come to attend your summons  now tell us what service you have to employ us in  for I assure you  we are both ready to do you any act of friendship in our power ’  My lord  I thank you  said Mr Arnold  the friendship you honour me with  I flattered myself  some time ago  might have been serviceable to me  I must not now think of making use of it  When I requested the favour of lady V——’s presence and your’s in town  I meant to intreat your interposition between me and Mrs Arnold  I know I have wronged her so  that were she any other than the woman she is  I could never hope for forgiveness  but from her I did hope it  and thought your good offices might bring about a reunion  But that is all over  I neither desire nor wish it now   I am sorry for that  Mr Arnold  said I  I am sure nothing in this world besides can ever make either your lady or you happy   Do you know  madam  said he   and the poor man really looked wildly  that you see an absolute beggar before you  A man without a foot of land  overwhelmed with debts  and who shortly will not have a house to shelter himself in  I deserve it all  but Mrs Arnold does not  Do you think  that after all the wrongs I have done her  I will involve her
