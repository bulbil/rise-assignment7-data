 there was  however  an embarrassment in her countenance at those offers  which a little alarms me  she absolutely declined coming to Bellfield  I know not what to think       Emily  who has taken a strong prejudice in her favor  will answer for her conduct with her life  but I will own to you  I am not without my doubts       When I consider the inhuman arts of the abandoned part of one sex  and the romantic generosity and too unguarded confidence  of the most amiable of the other  when I reflect that where women love  they love without reserve  that they fondly imagine the man who is dear to them possessed of every virtue  that their very integrity of mind prevents their suspicions  when I think of her present retirement  so apparently ill suited to her education  when I see her beauty  her elegance of person  with that tender and melancholy air  so strongly expressive of the most exquisite sensibility  when  in short  I see the child  and observe her fondness for him  I have fears for her  which I cannot conquer       I am as firmly convinced as Emily of the goodness of her heart  but I am not so certain that even that very goodness may not have been  from an unhappy concurrence of circumstances  her misfortune       We have company to dine       Adieu  till the evening   Ten at night       About three hours ago  Emily received the inclosed  from our fair cottager       Adieu   Your affectionate  ED  RIVERS      To Mrs  RIVERS        Madam        Though I have every reason to wish the melancholy event which brought me here  might continue unknown  yet your generous concern for a stranger  who had no recommendation to your notice but her appearing unhappy  and whose suspicious situation would have injured her in a mind less noble than yours  has determined me to lay before you a story  which it was my resolution to conceal for ever        I saw  Madam  in your countenance  when you honored me by calling at my house this morning  and I saw with an admiration no words can speak  the amiable struggle between the desire of knowing the nature of my distress in order to soften it  and the delicacy which forbad your enquiries  lest they should wound my sensibility and self love        To such a heart I run no hazard in relating what in the world would  perhaps  draw on me a thousand reproaches  reproaches  however  I flatter myself  undeserved        You have had the politeness to say  there is something in my appearance which speaks my birth above my present situation  in this  Madam  I am so happy as not to deceive your generous partiality        My father  who was an officer of family and merit  had the misfortune to lose my mother whilst I was an infant        He had the goodness to take on himself the care of directing my education  and to have me taught whatever he thought becoming my sex  though at an expence much too great for his income        As he had little more than his commission  his parental tenderness got so far the better of his love for his profession  that  when I was about fifteen  he determined on quitting the army  in order to provide better for me  but  whilst he was in treaty for this purpose  a fever carried him off in a few days  and left me to the world  with little more than five hundred pounds  which  however  was  by his will  immediately in my power        I felt too strongly the loss of this excellent parent to attend to any other consideration  and  before I was enough myself to think what I was to do for a subsistence  a friend of my own age  whom I tenderly loved  who was just returning from school to her father s  in the north of England  insisted on my accompanying her  and spending some time with her in the country        I found in my dear Sophia  all the consolation my grief could receive  and  at her pressing solicitation  and that of her father  who saw his daughter s happiness depended on having me with her  I continued there three years  blest in the calm delights of friendship  and those blameless pleasures  with which we should be too happy  if the heart could content itself  when a young baronet  whose form was as lovely as his soul was dark  came to interrupt our felicity        My Sophia  at a ball  had the misfortune to attract his notice  she was rather handsome  though without regular features  her form was elegant and feminine  and she had an air of youth  of softness  of sensibility  of blushing innocence  which seemed intended to inspire delicate passions alone  and which would have disarmed any mind less depraved than that of the man  who only admired to destroy        She was the rose bud yet impervious to the sun
