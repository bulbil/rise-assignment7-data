good fortune did not attend squire Crabshaw in his retreat  The ludicrous singularity of his features  and the half mown crop of hair that bristled from one side of his countenance  invited some wags to make merry at his expense  one of them clapped a furze bush under the tail of Gilbert  who  feeling himself thus stimulated a posteriori  kicked and plunged  and capered in such a manner  that Timothy could hardly keep the saddle  In this commotion he lost his cap and his periwig  while the rabble pelted him in such a manner  that  before he could join his master  he looked like a pillar  or rather a pillory of mud             CHAPTER TEN  WHICH SHOWETH THAT HE WHO PLAYS AT BOWLS  WILL SOMETIMES MEET WITH RUBBERS   Sir Launcelot  boiling with indignation at the venality and faction of the electors  whom he had harangued to so little purpose  retired with the most deliberate disdain towards one of the gates of the town  on the outside of which his curiosity was attracted by a concourse of people  in the midst of whom stood Mr  Ferret  mounted upon a stool  with a kind of satchel hanging round his neck  and a phial displayed in his right hand  while he held forth to the audience in a very vehement strain of elocution   Crabshaw thought himself happily delivered when he reached the suburbs  and proceeded without halting  but his master mingled with the crowd  and heard the orator express himself to this effect —   Very likely you may undervalue me and my medicine  because I don t appear upon a stage of rotten boards  in a shabby velvet coat  and tie periwig  with a foolish fellow in a motley coat  to make you laugh  by making wry faces  but I scorn to use these dirty arts for engaging your attention  These paltry tricks  ad captandum vulgus  can have no effect but on idiots  and if you are idiots  I don t desire you should be my customers  Take notice  I don t address you in the style of a mountebank  or a High German doctor  and yet the kingdom is full of mountebanks  empirics  and quacks  We have quacks in religion  quacks in physic  quacks in law  quacks in politics  quacks in patriotism  quacks in government—High German quacks  that have blistered  sweated  bled  and purged the nation into an atrophy  But this is not all  they have not only evacuated her into a consumption  but they have intoxicated her brain  until she is become delirious  she can no longer pursue her own interest  or  indeed  rightly distinguish it  Like the people of Nineveh  she can hardly tell her right hand from her left  but  as a changeling  is dazzled and delighted by an ignis fatuus  a Will o  the wisp  an exhalation from the vilest materials in nature  that leads her astray through Westphalian bogs and deserts  and will one day break her neck over some barren rocks  or leave her sticking in some H——n pit  or quagmire    For my part  if you have a mind to betray your country  I have no objection  In selling yourselves and your fellow citizens  you only dispose of a pack of rascals who deserve to be sold  If you sell one another  why should not I sell this here Elixir of Long Life  which  if properly used  will protract your days till you shall have seen your country ruined  I shall not pretend to disturb your understandings  which are none of the strongest  with a hotchpotch of unintelligible terms  such as Aristotle s four principles of generation  unformed matter  privation  efficient  and final causes  Aristotle was a pedantic blockhead  and still more knave than fool  The same censure we may safely put on that wiseacre  Dioscorides  with his faculties of simples— his seminal  specific  and principal virtues  and that crazy commentator  Galen  with his four elements  elementary qualities  his eight complexions  his harmonies and discords  Nor shall I expatiate on the alkahest of that mad scoundrel  Paracelsus  with which he pretended to reduce flints into salt  nor archaeus or spiritus rector of that visionary Van Helmont  his simple  elementary water  his gas  ferments  and transmutations  nor shall I enlarge upon the salt  sulphur  and oil  the acidum vagum  the mercury of metals  and the volatilised vitriol of other modern chemists  a pack of ignorant  conceited  knavish rascals  that puzzle your weak heads with such jargon  just as a Germanised m——r throws dust in your eyes  by lugging in and ringing the changes on the balance of power  the Protestant religion  and your allies on the continent  acting like the juggler  who picks your pockets while he dazzles your eyes and amuses your fancy with twirling his fingers and reciting the gibberish of hocus pocus  for  in fact  the balance of power is a mere chimera  As for the Protestant religion  nobody gives himself any trouble about it  and allies on the continent  we have none  or  at least  none that would raise an
