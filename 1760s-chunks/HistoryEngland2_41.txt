should renounce all right to the crown of France  the union of two such powerful kingdoms being thought dangerous to the liberties of the rest of Europe  They covenanted that the Duke of Berry  his brother  the presumptive heir to the crown of France  after the death of the Dauphin  should also renounce his right to the crown of Spain  in case he became King of France  The Duke of Orleans was to make the same resignation  To oblige men thus to renounce their rights might have been injustice  but  for every good acquired  some inconvenience must be endured  these resignations  in some measure  served to calm the world temptsted up by long war  and have since become the basis of the law of nations  to which Europe professes present submission   By this treaty the Duke of Savoy had the island of Sicily  with the title of King  with Fenestrelles  and other places on the continent  which increase of his power seemed  in some measure  drawn from the spoils of the French monarchy  The Dutch had that barrier granted them  which they so long sought after  and  if the house of Bourbon seemed stripped of some dominion  in order to enrich the Duke of Savoy  on the other hand  the house of Austria was   110 taxed to supply the wants of the Hollanders  who were put in possession of the strongest towns in Flanders  With regard to England  its glory and interests were secured  They caused the fortifications of Dunkirk to be demolished  and its port to be destroyed  Spain gave up all right to Gibraltar and the island of Minorca  France resigned Hudson s Bay  Nova Scotia  and Newfoundland  but they were left in possession of Cape Breton  and the liberty of drying their fish upon the shore  Among the articles which were glorious to the English  it may be observed  that the setting free those who had been confined in the French prisons for professing the Protestant religion  was not the least  It was stipulated  that the Emperor should possess the kingdom of Naples  the Duchy of Milan  and the Spanish Netherlands  that the King of Prussia should have Upper Gueldre  and a time was fixed for the Emperor s acceding to these resolutions  for he had hitherto obstinately refused to assist at the negotiations  Thus it appears  that the English ministry did justice to all the world  but their country refused it to them  they were branded with all the terms of infamy and reproach by the Whig party  and accused of having given up the privileges and rights which England had to expect  Each party reviled the other in turn  the kingdom was divided into opposite factions  both so violent in their cause  that the truth  which both pretended to espouse  was attained by neither  both were virulent  and both wrong  These commotions  in some measure  served still more to impair the Queen s health  One fit of sickness succeeded another  nor did the consolation of her ministry serve to allay her anxieties  for they now had fallen out among themselves  the council chamber being turned into a theatre for the most bitter altercations  Oxford advised a reconciliation with the Whigs  whose resentment he now began to   111 fear  as the Queen s health appeared to be impaired  Bolingbroke  on the other hand  affected to set the Whigs at defiance  professed a warm zeal for the church  and mixed flattery with his other assiduities  Bolingbroke prevailed  Lord Oxford  the treasurer  was removed from his employment  and retired  meditating schemes of revenge  or new projects for future re establishment  His fall was so sudden  and so unexpected  that no plan was established for supplying the vacancy occasioned by his disgrace  All was confusion at court  and the Queen had no longer force to support the burthen  she sunk into a state of insensibility  and thus found refuge from anxiety in lethargic slumber  Every method was contrived to rouze her from this state  but in vain  her physicians dispaired of her life  The privy council assembled upon this occasion  the Dukes of Somerset and Argyle  being informed of the desperate state in which she lay  entered that assembly without being summoned  the members were surprized at their appearance  but the Duke of Shrewsbury thanked them for their readiness to give their assistance at such a critical juncture  and desired them to take their places  They now took all the necessary precautions for securing the succession in the house of Hanover  sent orders to the Heralds at Arms  and to a troop of life guards to be in readiness to mount  in order to proclaim the Elector of Brunswick King of Great Britain   On the thirtieth of July the Queen seemed somewhat relieved by medicines  rose from her bed  and  about eight  walked a little  when  casting her eyes on the clock that stood in her chamber  she continued to gaze for some time  One of the ladies in waiting asked her what she saw there more than usual  to which the Queen only answered by turning her eyes upon her with a dying look  She was soon after seized with a fit of the apoplexy  from which    112 however  she
