and so long deprived them  prays  and will every hour pray  my ever honoured and ever indulgent Father and Mother   Friday  May 25   Your dutifully devoted CLEMENTINA   THE Marquis was alone with his Lady in her dressing room when Camilla carried them this Letter  They opened it with impatience  They could not contain their joy when they perused it  They both declared  that it was all that should  all that ought to be exacted from het  The Bishop  Signor Jeronymo  and her two cousins  on the contents being communicated to them  were in cestasies of joy   All that the Count of Belvedere had wished for  was  that Lady Clementina would give him hope    281 that if she ever married  he might be the happy man  and for the sake of this distant hope  he was resolved to forego all other engagements  Sir Charles was desired to acquaint him with the happy tidings  He did  with his usual prudence  but his joy is extreme   The Marquis and Marchioness were impatient to embrace and thank their beloved Daughter  The moment she saw them she threw herself at their feet  as they sat together on one settee  and were rising to embrace her—O my father  O my mother  Have I not been perverse in your eyes —It was not I —You can pity me —It was not always in my power to think as I now do  My mind was disturbed  I sought for tranquility  and could no where find it  My brother Guiacomo was too precipitating  yet  in his earnestness to have me marry  shewed his disinterestedness  He gave me not time  as you both  thro  the advice of the common friend of us all have done  The nearest evil was the heaviest to me  I sought to avoid that  and might have fallen into greater  God reward you  my father  my mother  and all my dear friends  for the indulgence you have shewn me —To follow me too into foreign climates  at an unpropitious season of the year—And for what —Not to chide  not to punish me  but to restore me to the arms of your parental love —And did you not vouchsafe to enter into conditions with your child —How greatly disordered in my mind must I be  if I ever forget such instances of your graciousness   The tender parents pressed her to their bosoms  How did her two brothers and Mrs  Beaumont applaud her —  O how good  said she  are you all to me  What a malady  A malady of the darkest hue  was mine  that it could fill me with such apprehensions  as were able to draw a cloud between your goodness and my gratitude    282 and make even your indulgence wear the face of hardship to me   The Bishop thought it not adviseable  that the Count  who hardly knew how to trust himself with his own joy  should be presently introduced to her  The rejoicing Lover therefore walked into the garden  giving way to his agreeable contemplations   Clementina  her mind filled with self complacency on the joyful reception her proposal had met with  went into the garden  intending to take one of her usual walks  Laura attending her  The Count saw her enter  and fearing to disoblige her  if he broke in upon her  in her retirements  profoundly bowed  and took a different path  but she  crossing another alley  was near him before he was aware  He started  but recovering  threw himself at her feet—Life of my hope  Adorable Lady Clementina  said he—But could not at the moment speak another word   She relieved him from his confusion—Rise  my Lord  said she  I crossed to meet you  on purpose to exchange a few words with you  as you happened to be in the garden   I cannot  connot rise  till  thus prostrate at your feet  I have thanked you  madam  with my whole soul—  No thanks are due  my Lord  interrupting him  God knows what may happen in the next twelve months  Rise  my Lord   He arose   As a friend of our house  I will respect you  So I have heretofore told you  But for your own sake  for honour s  for justice sake  I think it necessary to tell you  you must not make an absolute dependance on me from what I have written to my Parents  tho  I repent not of what I have written   I will not  madam  For one year  for many years  I will await your pleasure  If at the end of any limited period  after that you have named  I cannot be so happy as to engage your favour  I will   283 resign to my destiny—Only  mean time  permit me to hope   I mentioned  my Lord  that it was for your own sake  that I wished you not to depend upon a contingency  Be you free to pursue your own measures  Who can say  what one  two  or three years may produce  Maladies that have once seized the head  generally  as I have heard say  keep their
