find a young  gay gentleman  seated very near her  and lolling   his arm  in a careless posture  over the back of the chair in which she   was sitting  on his entrance  they both rose to receive him with a great   deal of politeness  which he returned in the same manner  but added to   the first compliments  that he hoped he had been guilty of no   intrusion        Not at all  Sir   replied the brother of Miss Betsy   I was only   talking to my sister on some family affairs  which we may resume at any   time  when no more agreeable subjects of entertainment fall in our   way     Yes  Mr  Munden   said Miss Betsy   this is that brother whose   return to town you so often heard me wish for  and this  brother     continued she  turning to Mr  Francis   is a gentleman who sometimes   does me the honour of calling upon me  and whose visits to me I believe   you will not disapprove        She had no sooner ended these words than the two gentleman mutually   advanced  embraced  and said they should be proud of each other s   acquaintance  after which they entered into a conversation sprightly   enough for the time it lasted  which was not long  for Mr  Francis    looking on his watch  said he was extremely mortified to leave such good   company  but business of a very urgent nature called him to a different   place at that hour       As much as Mr  Munden was pleased to find himself so obligingly   introduced by his mistress to the acquaintance of her brother  he was   equally glad to be rid of him at this juncture  when he came prepared to   press her so home to an eclaircissement as should deprive her of all   possibility of keeping himself any longer in suspense       It was in vain for her now to have recourse to any of those evasions by   which she had hitherto put him off  and she found herself under a   necessity  either of entirely discarding him  or giving him some kind of   assurance that the continuance of his pretensions would not be in vain       Never had she been so plunged before  never had any of her lovers   insisted in such plain terms her declaring herself  and she was   compelled  as it were  to tell him  since he was so impatient for the   definition of his fate  it was from her brothers he must receive it  for   she was resolved  nay  had solemnly promised  to enter into no   engagement without their knowledge and approbation   But suppose   said   he   I should be so happy as to obtain their consent  may I then assure   myself you will be mine     Would you wish me to hate you   cried she    somewhat peevishly   Hate me   answered he   no  Madam  it is your love   I would purchase  almost at the expence of life         Persecute me then no more   said she   to give you promise  or   assurances  which would only make me see you with confusion  and think   of you with regret  it is sufficient I esteem you  and listen to the   professions of your love  let that content you  and leave to myself the   grant of more     Yet  Madam    resumed he  and was going on  but was   interrupted by the maid  who came hastily into the room  and said     Madam  here is Miss Mabel        She had no sooner spoke these words  than the lady she mentioned   followed her into the room  Miss Betsy was never more glad to see her   than now  when her presence afforded her so seasonable a relief   My   dear Miss Mabel   said she   this is kind indeed  when I already owe you   two visits     I believe you owe me more   answered she with a smile     but I did not come to reproach you  nor can this  indeed  be justly   called a visit  since it is only a mere matter of business brings me   hither at this time        Mr  Munden  on this  thought proper to take his leave  but  in doing so    said to Miss Betsy  with a very grave air   I hope  Madam  you will have   the goodness to consider seriously on what we have been talking of  I   will do myself the honour to wait upon your brothers to morrow
