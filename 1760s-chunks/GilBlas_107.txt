receiving fees  as at their public boards  that they paid most exorbitant ones for the privilege of mixing with such worshipful society   Florimonde  who lived at next door  dined and supped with Arsenia every day  Their long intimacy surprised every one  Coquets were not thought usually to maintain so good an understanding with each other  It was concluded that they would quarrel  sooner or late  about some paramour  but such reasoners could not see into the hearts of these exemplary friends  They were united in the bonds of indissoluble love  Instead of harbouring jealousy  like other women  they had everything in common  They had rather divide the plunder of mankind  than childishly fall out  and contend for trumpery  as hearts and affections   Laura  after the example of these two illustrious partners  turned the fresh season of youth to the best advantage  She had told me that I should see strange doings  And yet I did not take up the jealous part  I had promised to adopt the principles of the company on that score  For some days I kept my thoughts to myself  I only just took the liberty of asking her the names of the men whom she favoured with her private ear  She always told me that they were uncles or cousins  From what a prolific family was she sprung  King Priam had no luck in propagation  compared with her ancestors  Nor did this precious abigail confine herself to her uncles and cousins  she went now and then to lay a trap for unwary aliens  and personate the widow of quality under the auspices of the discreet old dowager above mentioned  In short Laura  to hit off her character exactly  was just as young  just as pretty  and just as loose as her mistress  who had no other advantage over her than that of figuring in a more public capacity   I was borne down by the torrent for three weeks  and ran the career of dissipation in my turn  But I must at the same time say for myself  that in the midst of pleasure I frequently felt the still small voice of conscience  arising from the impression of a serious education  which mixed gall in the Circean cup  Riot could not altogether get the better of remorse  on the contrary  the pangs of the last grew keener with the more shameful indulgence of the first  and  by a happy effect of my temperament  the disorders of a theatrical life began to make me shudder  Ah  wretch  said I to myself  is it thus that you make good the hopes of your family  Is it not enough to have thwarted their pious intentions  by not following your destined course of life as an instructor of youth  Need your condition of a servant hinder you from living decently and soberly  Are such monsters of iniquity fit companions for you  Envy  hatred  and avarice are predominant here  intemperance and idleness have purchased the fee simple there  the pride of some is aggravated into the most barefaced impudence  and modesty is turned out of doors  by the common consent of all  The business is settled  I will not live any longer with the seven deadly sins       BOOK THE FOURTH       CH  I     Gil Blas not being able to reconcile himself to the morals of the actresses  quits Arsenia  and gets into a more reputable service   A SURVIVING spark of honour and of religion  in the midst of so general depravity  made me resolve not only to leave Arsenia  but even to abjure all commerce with Laura  whom yet I could not cease to love  though I was well aware of her daily inconstancy  Happy the man who can thus profit by those appeals  which occasionally interrupt the headlong course of his pleasures  One fine morning  I made up my bundle  and  without reckoning with Arsenia  who indeed owed me next to nothing  without taking leave of my dear Laura  I burst from that mansion  which smelt of brimstone and fire reserved for the wicked  I had no sooner taken so virtuous a step  than providence interfered in my behalf  I met the steward of my late master  Don Matthias  and greeted him  he knew me again at once  and stopped to inquire where I lived  I answered that I had just left my place  that after staying near a month with Arsenia  whose manners did not at all suit me  I was come away by a sudden impulse of virtue  to save my innocence  The steward  just as if he had been himself of a religious cast  commended my scruples  and offered me a place much to my advantage  since I was so chaste and honest a youth  He kept his word  and introduced me on that very day into the family of Don Vincent de Gusman  with whose agent he was acquainted   I could not have got into a better service  nor did I repent in the sequel of having accepted the situation  Don Vincent was a very rich old nobleman  who had lived many years unincumbered with lawsuits or with a wife  The physicians had removed the last plague out of the way  in their
