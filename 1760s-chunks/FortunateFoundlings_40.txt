imagine she encouraged his passion  Neither the character  family  or   fortune of de Coigney being equal to what he thought Charlotta might   deserve  made him very uneasy at this report  and as he looked on her   not having acquainted him with his pretensions as an indication of her   having an affection for him  he resolved to put a stop to the progress   of it at once  which could be done no way so effectually as by removing   her from St  Germains       To this end the careful Father came himself to that court  and waited on   the princess  he told her highness  that being in an ill state of health   and obliged to keep much at home  Charlotta must exchange the honour she   enjoyed in her service  for the observance of her duty to a parent  who   was now incapable of any other pleasures than her society       The princess  to whom she was extremely dear  could not think of parting   with her without an extreme concern  but after the reasons he had given   for desiring it  would offer nothing for detaining her  on which she was   immediately called in  and made acquainted with this sudden alteration   in her affairs             CHAP  VIII        The parting of Horatio and mademoiselle Charlotta  and what happened   after she left St  Germains        A peal of thunder bursting over her head  could not have been more   alarming to mademoiselle Charlotta than the news she now heard  but her   father commanded  the princess had consented  and there was no remedy to   be hoped  she took leave of her royal mistress with a shower of   unfeigned tears  after which she retired to her apartment to prepare for   quitting it  while the baron went to pay his compliments to some of the   gentlemen at that court       To be removed in this sudden manner she could impute to no other motive   than that the love of Horatio had by some accident been betrayed to her   father   for she never so much as thought of monsieur de Coigney   and   the thoughts of being separated from him was so dreadful  that till this   fatal moment she knew not how dear he was to her   to add to the   calamity of her condition  he was that morning gone a hunting with the   Chevalier St  George  and she had not even the opportunity of giving him   the consolation of knowing she bore at least an equal part in the grief   this unexpected accident must occasion  Mademoiselle de Coigney came to   take leave of her  as did all the ladies of the queen s train as well as   the princess s  and expressed the utmost concern for losing so agreeable   a companion  but these ceremonies were tedious to her  and as she could   not see Horatio  she dispatched every thing with as much expedition as   her secret discontent would permit her to do  and then sent to let her   father know she was ready to attend him       When they were in the coach both observed a profound silence for some   time  at last  I hope Charlotta  said the baron  you have no   extraordinary reasons to be troubled at leaving St  Germains  none  my   lord  answered she  of so much moment to me as the fears my sudden   removal is owing to your being dissatisfied with my conduct  I flatter   myself  resumed he  you are conscious of nothing which should authorize   such an apprehension   you have had an education which ought to inform   you that persons of your sex and age are never to act in any material   point of themselves   but courts are places where this lesson is seldom   practised  and tho  the virtues of the English queen and princess are a   shining example to all about them  yet I am of opinion that innocence is   safest in retirement       As she was fully convinced in her mind that it was only owing to some   jealousy of her behaviour that she had been taken from St  Germains  and   also that it was on the score of Horatio  she would not enquire too   deeply for fear of giving her father an opportunity of entering into   examinations  which she thought she could not answer without either   injuring the truth  or avowing what would not only have incensed him to   a very great degree  but also put him upon measures which would destroy   even the most distant hope of ever seeing Horatio more  He  on his side    would not acquaint her with the sentiments which the above mentioned   suggestions had inspired him with  thinking he should discover more of
