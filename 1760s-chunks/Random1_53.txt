here s a fellow who affronts me upon the bench—but I ll lay you fast  sirrah  I will—for notwithstanding your laced jacket  I believe you are a notorious felon  —  My friend was so much abashed at this menace  which was thundered out with great vociferation  that he changed colour  and remained speechless—This his worship took for a symptom of guilt  and to compleat the discovery continued his threats —   Now  I am convinced you are a thief —your face discovers it—you tremble all over—your conscience won t lie still—you will be hang d    145 sirrah  raising his voice  you will be hanged  and happy had it been for the world  as well as your own miserable soul  if you had been detected and cut off in the beginning of your career —Come hither  clerk  and take this man s confession  —  I was in an agony of consternation  when the constable going into another room with his worship  acquainted him with the truth of the story  upon which he returned with a smiling countenance  and addressing himself to us all  said  it was always his way to terrify young people  when they came before him  that his threats might make a strong impression on their minds  and deterr them from engaging in scenes of riot and debauchery which commonly ended before the judge —Thus having cloaked his own want of discernment  under the disguise of paternal care  we were dismissed  and I found myself as much lightened as if a mountain had been lifted from off my breast       146  CHAP  XVIII   I carry my qualifications to the navy office—the nature of it—the behaviour of the s—t—y—Strap s concern for my absence—a battle betwixt him and a blacksmith—the troublesome consequences of it—his harrangue to me—his friend the school master recommends me to a French apothecary  who entertains me as a journeyman   I Would willingly have gone home to sleep  but was told by my companions  that we must deliver our letters of qualification at the navyoffice before one a clock  upon which we repaired thither  and gave them to the s—t—y  who opened and read them  and I was mightily pleased to find myself qualified for second mate of a third rate  When he had stuck them all together on a file  one of our company asked if there were any vacancies  to which he answered  No  Then I ventured to enquire if any ships were to be put in commission soon —At which he surveyed me with a look of ineffable contempt  and pushing us out of his office  locked the door without deigning us one word —We went down stairs and conferred together on our expectations  when I understood that each of them had been recommended to one or other of the commissioners  and each of them promised the first vacancy that   147 should fall  but that none of them relied solely upon that interest  without a present to the s—t—y  with whom the c—mm—rs went snacks —For which reason each had provided a small purse  and I was asked what I proposed to give —This was a vexatious question to me  who  so far from being in a capacity to gratify a ravenous s—t—y  had not wherewithal to buy me a dinner —I therefore answered  I had not determined yet what to give  and sneaked off towards my own lodging  cursing my fate all the way  and inveighing with much bitterness against the barbarity of my grandfather  and the sordid avarice of my relations  who left me a prey to contempt and indigence —Full of these disagreeable reflections  I arrived at the house where I lodged  and relieved my landlord from great anxiety on my account  for this honest man believed I had met with some dismal accident  and that he should never see me again —Strap  who had been to see me in the morning  understanding I had been abroad all night  was almost distracted  and after having obtained leave of his master  had gone in quest of me  though he was even more ignorant of the town than I  Not being willing to inform my landlord of my adventure  I told him  I had met an acquaintance at Surgeon s hall  with whom I spent the evening and night  but being very much infested by bugs  I had not slept much  and therefore intended to take a little repose  so saying  I went to bed and desired to be awakened if Strap happened to come while I should be asleep —I was accordingly roused by my friend himself  who entered my chamber about three a clock in the afternoon  and presented a figure to my eyes  that I could   148 scarce believe real —In short  this affectionate shaver  setting out towards Surgeon s hall  had enquired for me there to no purpose  from thence he found his way to the navy office  where he he could hear no tidings of me  because I was unknown to every body then present  he afterwards went upon Change in hopes of seeing me upon the Scotch walk  but without any success  At last  being almost in dispair of finding me  he resolved to ask every body he met in the street  if perchance any one could give him information about me  and actually put his resolution
