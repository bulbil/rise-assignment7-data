indisposed that he could not see company —I interpreted this message into a bad omen  and came away muttering curses against his lordship s politeness  and ready to go to loggerheads with myself for being so egregiously duped —But that I might have some satisfaction for the loss I had sustained  I besieged him closely at his levée  and persecuted him with my solicitations  not without faint hopes indeed  of reaping something more from my industry  than the bare pleasure of making him uneasy  though I could never obtain another private hearing  during the whole course of my attendance  neither had I resolution enough  to undeceive Strap  whose looks in a little time  were so whetted with impatience  that whenever I came home  his eyes devoured me  as it were  with eagerness of attention   At length  however  finding myself reduced to my last guinea  I was compelled to disclose my necessity  though I endeavoured to sweeten the discovery by rehearsing to him the daily assurances I received from my patron —But these promises were not of efficacy sufficient to support the spirits of my friend  who no sooner understood the lowness of my finances  than uttering a dreadful groan  he exclaimed     In the name of God  what shall we do  —  In order   172 to comfort him  I said that many of my acquaintance  who were in a worse condition than we  supported  notwithstanding  the character and appearance of gentlemen  and advising him to thank God that we had as yet incurred no debt  proposed he should pawn my sword of steel inlaid with gold  and trust to my discretion for the rest  This expedient was wormwood and gall to poor Strap  who  in spite of his invincible affection for me  still retained notions of oeconomy and expence suitable to the narrowness of his education  nevertheless he complied with my request  and raised seven pieces on the sword in a twinkling —This supply  inconsiderable as it was  made me as happy for the present  as if I had had five hundred pounds in bank  for by this time I was so well skilled in procrastinating every troublesome reflection  that the prospect of want seldom affected me very much  let it be ever so near —And now indeed it was nearer than I imagined  for my landlord having occasion for money  put me in mind of my being indebted to him five guineas in lodging  and telling me he had a sum to make up  begged I would excuse his importunity and discharge the debt  Though I could ill spare so much cash  my pride took the resolution of disbursing it  which I did in a cavalier manner  after he had written a discharge  telling him with an air of scorn and resentment  I saw he was resolved that I should not be long in his books  while Strap  who stood by  and knew my circumstances  wrung his hands in secret  gnawed his nether lip  and turned yellow with despair —Whatever appearance of indifference my vanity enabled me to put on  I was thunderstruck with this demand  which I had no sooner   173 satisfied  than I hastened into company  with a view of beguiling my cares with conversation  or of drowning them in wine     After dinner  a party was accordingly made in the coffee house  from whence we adjourned to the tavern  where instead of sharing the mirth of the company  I was as much chagrined at their good humour as a damned soul in hell would be at a glimpse of heaven —In vain did I swallow bumper after bumper  the wine had lost its effect upon me  and so far from raising my dejected spirits  could not even lay me asleep —Banter  who was the only intimate I had  Strap excepted  perceived my anxiety  and when we broke up  reproached me with pusilanimity  for being cast down at any disappointment that such a rascal as Strutwell could be the occasion of —I told him I did not at all see how Strutwell s being a rascal alleviated my misfortune  and gave him to understand that my present grief did not so much proceed from that disappointment  as from the low ebb of my fortune  which was sunk to something less than two guineas —At this declaration  he cried     Pshaw  is that all    and assured me  there were a thousand ways of living in town without fortune  he himself having subsisted many years entirely by his wit —I expressed an eager desire of being acquainted with some of these methods  and he  without further expostulation  bid me follow him —He conducted me to a house under the piazzas in Convent Garden  which we entered  and having delivered our swords to a grim fellow who demanded them at the foot of the stair case  ascended to the second story  where I saw multitudes of people standing round two gaming tables  loaded in a manner    174 with gold and silver —My conductor let me know that this was the house of a worthy Scotch Lord  who availing himself of the privilege of his peerage  had set up publick gaming tables  from the profits of which he drew a comfortable livelihood —He then explained the difference between the sitters and the betters
