put the nation into a condition for war  Letters of reprisal were granted against the Spaniards  These preparations were regarded by the Spanish court as actual hostilities  The French ambassador at the Hague declared  that the King his master was obliged  by treaties  to assist the King of Spain  he dissuaded the Dutch from espousing the cause of England  who promised him an inviolable neutrality  It is curious enough to consider the revolutions which the political system of Europe had undergone  But about twenty years before  France and England were combined against Spain  at present  France and Spain united against England  Those statesmen who build upon alliances as a lasting basis of power  will  at length  find themselves fatally mistaken   A rupture between Great Britain and Spain being now become inevitable  the people  who had long clamoured for war  began to feel uncommon alacrity at its approach  and the ministry finding it unavoidable  began to be earnest in preparation  Orders were issued for augmenting the land forces  and raising a body of marines  Two rich Spanish prizes were taken in the Mediterranean  and war declared against them in form  Admiral Vernon was sent to the West Indies  commander of the fleet  in order o distress the Spaniards in that part of the globe    156 Vernon was a rough and honest soldier  untainted with the corruption or the effeminacy of the times  He had  in the house of commons  asserted  that Porto Bello  a fort and harbour in South America  might be easily taken  and that he himself would undertake to reduce it with six ships only  A project which appeared so wild  and impossible  was ridiculed by the ministry  but  as he still insisted upon the proposal  they were pleased in complying with his request  This would at once rid them of a troublesome antagonist in the house  and  in case of his failure  there would be a new cause of triumph in his disgrace  In this  however  they were disappointed  The admiral  with six ships only  attacked and demolished all the fortifications of the place  and came away victorious  almost without bloodshed  This dawning of success upon the British arms induced the house of commons to enter vigorously into the King s measures for carrying on the war  They inabled him to equip a very powerful navy  they voted a subsidy to the King of Denmark  and impowered their Sovereign to defray some other expences  not specified in the estimates  the whole of their grants amounting to about four millions  The war was carried on with vigour  and the debates in the house of commons became less violent  In a nation  like England  of arts  arms  and commerce  war  at certain intervals of time  must ever be serviceable  It turns the current of wealth from the industrious to the enterprising  Thus  all orders of mankind find encouragement  and the nation becomes composed of individuals  who have skill to acquire property  and who have courage to defend it   I am   c     157  LETTER XIX   A War between England and Spain was sufficient to communicate disturbances over all the globe  Countries that were once too obscure to be known  were now seen to send out fleets  one ship of which was capable of destroying all the naval power of an Asiatic empire  A squadron of ships commanded by Commodore Anson was equipped  in order to sail through the Streights of Magellan into the South Sea  and to act against the enemy on the coasts of Chili and Peru  This fleet was to co operate occasionally with Admiral Vernon across the Isthmus of Darien  but the delays and blunders of the ministry frustrated this scheme  though originally well laid  However  though too late in the season  the Commodore set forward with five ships of the line  a frigate  and two store ships  supplied with provisions and other merchandize  designed to carry on a trade with the savage inhabitants of that part of the world  or to conciliate their affections  The number of men amounted  in all  to about fourteen hundred  including two hundred invalids taken from the hospitals  and two hundred new raised recruits  This whole expedition is a fine instance of the power of perseverance in forcing fortune  The Commodore steered his course by the island of Madeira  proceeded to the Cape Verd Islands  and sailed along the coasts of Brazil  He refreshed for some time at the island of St  Catharine  in twenty seven degrees of southern latitude  a spot that enjoys all the verdure and fruitage of those luxurious climates  From this place he steered still onward into the cold and tempestuous climates of the south  along the coast of Patagonia  and  in about five months  entered the famous Streights of Magellan  After having suffered the most violent tempests he doubled Cape Horn  the rest of his fleet were   158 dispersed or wrecked  his crew deplorably disabled by the scurvy  and his own ship with difficulty arrived on the Island of Juan Fernandez  In this delicious abode he remained for some time  where nature seemed  in some measure  to console mankind far the calamities of their own avarice and ambition In order to improve
