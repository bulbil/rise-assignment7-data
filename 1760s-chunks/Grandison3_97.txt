commanded me to be very minute in the account of all my dealings with her  that you might know how to conduct yourselves to her for the cure of the unhappy malady  I obey   The first and second days  after our return to Florence  were passed in endeavouring to divert her  as our guest  in all the ways we could think of  But finding  that company was irksome to her  and that she only bore with it for politeness sake  I told the Ladies    240 that I would take her entirely into my own care  and devote my whole time to her service  They acquiesced  And when I told Lady Clementina of my intention  she rejoiced at it  and did me the honour to assure me  that my conversation would be balm to her heart  if she could enjoy it without mixt company   Your Ladyship will see  however  from what I have mentioned of her regard for me  that I had made use of my time in the two pasts days to ingratiate myself into the favour of your Clementina  She will have me call her nothing but Clementina  Excuse therefore  madam  the freedom of my stile   She engaged me last night to give her a lesson  as she called it  in an English author  I was surprised at her proficiency in my native tongue  Ah my dear  said I  what an admirable manner of teaching must your tutor have had  if I am to judge by the great progress you have made in so short a time  in the acquiring of a tongue that has not the sweetness of your own  tho  it has a force and expressiveness that is more than equal  I think  to any of the modern languages   She blushed—Do you think so  said she—And I saw  by the turn of her eye  and her consciousness  that I had no need to hint to her Count Marulli  nor any other man   I took upon me  without pushing her  just then  upon the supposed light dropt in from this little incident  to mention the Count of Belvedere with distinction  as the Marquis had desired I would   She said  She could not by any means think of him   I told her  that as all her family approved highly of the Count  I thought they were intitled to know her objections  and to judge of the reasonableness or unreasonableness of them  Indeed  my dear  said I  you do not  in this point  treat your father and mother with the dutifulness that their indulgence deserves     241 She started  That is severely said  is it not  madam   Consider of it  my dear  and if you pronounce it so  after an hour s reflection  I will call it so  and ask your pardon   I am afraid  said she  I am in fault  I have the best and most indulgent of parents  There are some things  some secrets  that one cannot be forward to divulge  One should perhaps be commanded out of them with a high hand   Your acknowlegement  my dear  said I  is more generous than the occasion given for it  But if you will not think me impertinent—  Don t  don t  ask me too close questions  madam  interrupted she  I am afraid I can deny nothing   I am persuaded  my dear Clementina  that the mutual unbosoming of secrets is the cement of faithful Friendship  and true Love  Whenever any new turn in one s affairs happens  whenever any new lights open  the friendly heart rests not  till it has communicated to its fellow heart the new lights  the interesting events  and this communicativeness knits the true Lover s knot still closer  But what a solitariness  what a gloom  what a darkness  must possess that mind that can trust no friend with its inmost thoughts  The big secret  when it is of an interesting nature  will swell the heart till it is ready to burst  Deep melancholy must follow—I would not for the world have it so much as thought  that I had not a soul large enough for friendship  And is not the essence of friendship communication  mingling of hearts  and emptying our very soul into that of a true friend   Why that s true  But  madam  a young creature may be so circumstanced  as not to have a true friend  or  if she has near her a person to whom she might communicate her whole mind without doubt of her fidelity  yet there may be a forbiddingness in the   242 person  a difference in years  in degree  as in my Camilla  who is  however  a very good woman—We people of condition  madam  have more courtiers about us than friends  But Camilla s fault is teazing  and always harping upon one string  and that by my friends commands  It would be therefore more laudable to open my mind to my mother  than to her  as it would be the same thing   Very true  my dear  And as you have a mother  who is less of the mother than she would be of
