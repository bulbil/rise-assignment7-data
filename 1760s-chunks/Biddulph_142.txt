but said  I had already sat so long in the cold  that I felt myself chilled  and  with her ladyship’s permission  would place myself at her fire side till dinner was ready  She asked her woman  carelessly  why I had not been shewn into the dining parlour  She then turned to her millener again  to whom she gave a particular charge to have a suit of very rich point  which she had fixed on  done up for her against the next night  by which I found my sister was going to throw off her mourning intirely  that which she had on being so slight  that it was scarcely to be distinguished for such   My brother entered the room while she was thus employed  and having saluted me  looked at his watch  and asked lady Sarah  had she ordered dinner later than usual  She told him  she had ordered it half an hour later than ordinary  as she had a mind to make a long morning  having dedicated it to trades people  with whom she had a hundred things to settle  My brother cast a side glance at me  I thought he looked a little abashed at the impertinence and ill breeding of his wife   Lady Sarah had by this time huddled on her cloaths  a laced footman appeared at the door  who summoned us  by a silent bow  to dinner   The millener gathered up her frippery  and put them into a band box  telling her  she would wait on her ladyship again  Lady Sarah answered  You have got a monstrous way to go  Mrs— I forget the name   and  as I have not half done with you yet  you may stay and dine here  as we are alone  and I will look over the rest of the things in the evening  as I shall not have another leisure day while I am in town     This was going a little too far  Sir George felt it  I believe  lady Sarah  said he  this gentlewoman has a coach waiting for her at the door  he had seen it  for he was but just come in   perhaps it may be inconvenient to detain her  she may leave the things  and call another time  The woman took the hint  though she before seemed inclined to accept of the honour lady Sarah had done her  She made her curt’sey  and withdrew  As this  however  had brought on a variety of fresh instructions  it detained us so long  that the dinner was quite cold  nor was our repast  had it even been warm  by any means answerable to the elegance of the service  the superb sideboard  and the number of attendants  In short  the dinner was composed of a parcel of tossed up dishes  that looked like the fragments of a feast  You know there is nobody more indifferent to the pleasures of the table than I am  yet I own that this  joined to the rest of this foolish woman’s behaviour  nettled me extremely  There was such a mixture of sordidness and vanity in the whole apparatus  as made it truly contemptible   I made haste to put an end to my visit  as soon as I possibly could after dinner  with a resolution never to repeat it   From these few sketches of lady Sarah  you may form some kind of an idea of what sort of creature it is  I should pity Sir George  but that I think her disposition is not extremely opposite to his own   June 24  I am told that the widow Arnold is actually married to that vile attorney who was the contriver  and more than partner  in her iniquity  I am really glad she has lost the name of a family to which she was a disgrace  Every body now believes that I and my children have been greatly injured  but how unavailing is compassion  it only mortifies  when it is expressed by the pitying words and looks of people  who have it neither in their power nor inclination to assist you  This Mrs Arnold  bad as she is  is visited and caressed  Favour always follows the fortunate   June 25  This day Sir George and his lady set out for Scotland  He came to take his leave of us  but made an apology for lady Sarah  whose hurry would not permit her to call on us  My brother says  they shall stay some months at her uncle’s  Lord K——  He told me  at parting  he    should write to me as soon as he got to his journey’s end  having something very particular to say to me   July 7  I have read over my journal of the last fortnight  and am startled to think what a poor insignificant being I am  Not a single act worth recording  even to you  My whole life perhaps may have passed so  yet one is apt to fancy  that they are doing something of importance  while they are engaged in the little bustle of the world  be it in ever so trifling a manner  and when you find you have a variety of incidents to relate  in which you yourself were concerned  that your
