but even thrust out from his house  But the calamity stops not there  she is cruelly aspersed by the world through your suggestions  and I am the person pointed at for the injurer of Mr Arnold’s honour  and the destroyer of his wife’s innocence  You have brought shame and grief into a worthy family  Lady Bidulph  an excellent woman  has not been able to overcome the shock of the barbarous treatment her daughter has met with  Her brother  the beloved friend of my heart  suffers equal distress  for  though he is conscious of his sister’s innocence  he feels the wounds that her reputation has received  nor    can he possibly redress the mischief  as his sister’s injuries spring from a cause which her delicacy will not permit to be scrutinized  Her two poor children are left without a mother  she herself almost without a friend  and sinking every day under the weight of such complicated misery  As for Mr Arnold himself  I profess no personal regard for him  I scarce know him  but  for his family’s sake  I would  on any other occasion  risque my life to save him from ruin  for ruin you have almost brought on him  I am no stranger to the sums he has lavished on you  his purchasing an employment for one of your brothers  and redeeming another from a prison  You have lost nothing by my proceedings but what I shall make up ten fold to you  if you behave so as to deserve my kindness  I have now laid before you the true reasons for my conduct  I hope  that by breaking the inchantment that tied Mr Arnold’s heart  and blinded his understanding  he may be induced to do justice to his injured lady and her family  If this comes to pass  as I have strong reason to hope  I have no doubt of the lady’s character being retrieved  Groundless calumnies generally die of themselves  unless industriously kept alive by malice  Mrs Arnold’s blameless conduct  the friendship her brother has all along continued to favour me with  joined to this last apparent proof of my attachment to you  will  I am certain  in the eyes of the world  acquit her of all suspicion of guilt  Your letter to Mr Arnold will  as far as relates to your own opinion of her  give unquestionable evidence of her innocence   Now  Mrs Gerrarde  lay your hand on your heart  and answer me if I have not given you reasons  which  though they may not be satisfactory to you  are in themselves of weight sufficient to justify my conduct   I had watched her countenance narrowly during my discourse  which she had listened to without once looking at me  I saw I had shocked and even confounded her  but I saw no remorse  no contrition in her looks  All artifice was now at an end  and she unmasked the fiend directly  She started off her chair with the looks and gesture of a fury  and fixing her eyes  which had really something diabolical in them at that instant  steadily on me  You wretch  she cried  with a voice answerable to her looks  you are such a false  dissembling  mean spirited reptile  that if you had a kingdom to offer me  and would lay yourself at my feet to beg my acceptance of you  I would trample on you like dirt  and she stamped on the floor with the air of an amazon  Do you think you shall carry on this fine contrived    enterprize  No  if I perish for it  I will have vengeance  Mr Arnold shall know how I have been deceived and betrayed  and I will at least have the satisfaction of getting your life  if I lose every thing besides   A burst of malignant tears now gushed from her eyes  but she robbed them of their efficacy  by mixing with them the bitterest imprecations against me  She curst even the innocent Mrs Arnold  you  and the whole family  and her own folly  in being blinded by the arts of such a worthless milk sop as myself   I let her give vent to her passion  calmly walking about the room all the time  only now and then casting an eye on her  for fear she should have rushed on me with a penknife  for I have not the least doubt  if she had had such an instrument about her  she would have made an attempt that might have given a very tragical turn to my adventures   When she had done sobbing  I addressed her in a very stern voice  for I found I had no baby to deal with  and therefore resolved to frighten her into submission   I told you before  Madam  that violence would be of no use to you  your menaces I laugh at  you are in my power intirely  and absolutely at my disposal  to think of getting out of my hands would be vain  for it is as impracticable as flying  No mortal knows where you are but the people of this house  who are strangers to your name and circumstances  and if they knew both  they are so totally at my devotion  that it would not avail you  I shall
