  revolutions happening afterwards in both their fortunes  preventing him   from acting as it is possible he might design       The education he allowed them indeed gave very good grounds for the   above mentioned conjecture   Louisa being taught all the accomplishments   that became a maid of quality to be mistress of  and Horatio having gone   thro  all the learning of the school  was taken home to his own   house  from whence he was to go to Oxford  in order to finish his   studies in the character of a gentleman commoner       But when every thing was preparing for this purpose  he came one morning   into the chamber of his patron  and throwing himself on his knees     Think me not  sir  said he  too presuming in the request I am about to   make you   I know all that I am is yours   That I am the creature of   your bounty  and that  without being a father  you have done more for me   than many of those  who are so  do for their most favourite sons   I   know also that you are the best judge of what is fit for me  and have   not the least apprehensions that you will not always continue the same   goodness to me  provided I continue  as I have hitherto done  the   ambition of meriting it   Yet  sir  pardon me if I now discover a desire   with which I long have laboured  of doing something of myself which may   repair the obscurity of my birth  and prove to the world that heaven has   endued this foundling with a courage and resolution capable of   undertaking the greatest actions       In speaking these last words a fire seemed to sparkle from his eyes    which sufficiently denoted the vehemence of his inward agitations    Dorilaus was extremely surprized  but after a little pause  what is it   you request of me  said that noble gentleman   at the same time raising   him from the posture he was in  or by what means than such as I have   already taken  can I oblige you to think that  in being my foundling    fortune dealt not too severely with you       Ah  sir  mistake me not  I beseech you  replied the young Horatio  or   think me wanting in my gratitude either to heaven or you   But  sir  it   is to your generous care in cultivating the talents I received from   nature  that I owe this emulation  this ardor for doing something that   might give me a name  which is the only thing your bounty cannot   bestow   My genius inclines me to the army   Of all the accomplishments   you have caused me to be instructed in  geography  fortification  and   fencing  have been my darling studies   Of what use  sir  will they be   to me in an idle life  permit me then the opportunity of showing the   expense you have been at has not been thrown away   I know they will say   I am too young to bear a commission  but if I had the means of going a   volunteer  I cannot help thinking but I should soon give proofs the   extreme desire I have to serve my country that way would well attone for   my want of years       The more he spoke  the more the astonishment of his patron increased  he   admired the greatness of his spirit  but was troubled it led him to a   desire of running into so dangerous a way of life   He represented to   him all the hardships of a soldier  the little regard that was sometimes   paid to merit  and gave him several instances of gentlemen who had   passed their youth in the service  and behaved with extreme bravery  yet   had no other reward than their fears  and a consciousness of having done   more than was their duty  in war  said he  the superior officers carry   away all the glory as well as profits of the victory  whereas in civil   employments it is quite otherwise  in physic  in law  in divinity  or in   the state  your merits will be immediately conspicuous to those who have   the power to reward you  and if you are desirous of acquiring a name  by   which I suppose you mean to become the head of a family  any of these   afford you a much greater prospect of success  and it lies much more in   my power of assisting your promotion       To these he added many other arguments  but they were not of the least   weight with the impatient Horatio  He was obstinate in his entreaties    which he even with tears enforced  and Dorilaus
