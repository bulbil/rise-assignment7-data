you a description of his attitude —otherwise he will naturally stand represented  by your imagination  in an uneasy posture —stiff —perpendicular —dividing the weight of his body equally upon both legs —his eye fix d  as if on duty —his look determined —clinching the sermon in his left hand  like his firelock —In a word  you would be apt to paint Trim  as if he was standing in his platoon ready for action —His attitude was as unlike all this as you can conceive     He stood before them with his body swayed  and bent forwards just so far  as to make an angle of 85 degrees and a half upon the plain of the horizon —which sound orators  to whom I address this  know very well  to be the true persuasive angle of incidence —in any other angle you may talk and preach — tis certain —and it is done every day —but with what effect —I leave the world to judge   The necessity of this precise angle of 85 degrees and a half to a mathematical exactness —does it not shew us  by the way —how the arts and sciences mutually befriend each other   How the duce Corporal Trim  who knew not so much as an acute angle from an obtuse one  came to hit it so exactly     —or whether it was chance or nature  or good sense or imitation   c  shall be commented upon in that part of this cyclopaedia of arts and sciences  where the instrumental parts of the eloquence of the senate  the pulpit  the bar  the coffee house  the bed chamber  and fire side  fall under consideration   He stood —for I repeat it  to take the picture of him in at one view  with his body sway d  and somewhat bent forwards —his right leg firm under him  sustaining seven eighths of his whole weight —the foot of his left leg  the defect of which was no disadvantage to his attitude  advanced a little —not laterally  nor forwards  but in a line betwixt them —his knee bent  but that not violently —but so as to fall within the limits of the line of beauty —and I add     of the line of science too —for consider  it had one eighth part of his body to bear up —so that in this case the position of the leg is determined —because the foot could be no further advanced  or the knee more bent  than what would allow him mechanically  to receive an eighth part of his whole weight under it —and to carry it too   ☞ This I recommend to painters —need I add —to orators —I think not  for  unless they practise it —they must fall upon their noses   So much for Corporal Trim s body and legs —He held the sermon loosely —not carelessly  in his left hand  raised something above his stomach  and detach d a little from his breast —his right arm falling negligently by his side  as nature    and the laws of gravity ordered it —but with the palm of it open and turned towards his audience  ready to aid the sentiment  in case it stood in need   Corporal Trim s eyes and the muscles of his face were in full harmony with the other parts of him —he look d frank —unconstrained —something assured —but not bordering upon assurance   Let not the critic ask how Corporal Trim could come by all this  I ve told him it shall be explained —but so he stood before my father  my uncleToby  and Dr  Slop —so swayed his body  so contrasted his limbs  and with such an oratorical sweep throughout the whole figure —a statuary might have modell d from it —nay  I doubt whether the oldest Fellow of a College —or the Hebrew    Professor himself  could have much mended it   Trim made a bow  and read as follows   The SERMON     HEBREWS xiii  18   —For we trust we have a good Conscience —   TRust —Trust we have a good conscience     Certainly  Trim  quoth my father  interrupting him  you give that sentence a very improper accent  for you curl up your nose  man  and read it with such a sneering tone  as if the Parson was going to abuse the Apostle     He is  an  please your Honour  replied Trim  Pugh  said my father  smiling   Sir  quoth Dr  Slop  Trim is certainly in the right  for the writer  who I perceive is a Protestant  by the snappish manner in which he takes up the Apostle  is certainly going to abuse him —if this treatment of him has not done it already  But from whence  replied my father  have you concluded so soon  Dr  Slop  that the writer is of our Church —for aught I can see yet —he may be of any Church —Because  answered Dr  Slop  if he was of ours —he durst no more take such a licence —than a bear by his beard —If  in our communion  Sir  a man was to insult an Apostle —a saint —or even the paring of a saint s nail —he would have his eyes scratched out —What  by the saint  quoth
