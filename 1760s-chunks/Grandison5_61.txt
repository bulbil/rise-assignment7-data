XXV  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  In Continuation   Bologna  Monday  July 10—21   I Had no call for rest last night  I only reposed myself in a chair for about an hour  I sent early in the morning a note  to enquire  with the tenderest solicitude  after all their healths  and particularly Clementina s and Jeronymo s  A written answer was returned by Jeronymo  that his sister had rested so very ill  that it was thought adviseable to keep her quiet all day  unless she should be particularly earnest to see me  and  in that case  they would send me word   I was myself very much indisposed  yet had a difficulty to deny myself  tho  uninvited  to attend them at dinner  My own disorder  however  determined me not to go  unless sent for  It would  I thought  be too visible to them all  and might raise a suspicion  that I wanted to move compassion  A meanness of which I am not capable  Yet  indisposed as I was  still more  in the afternoon  I hoped to have an invitation for half an hour  But not being sent to  I repeated my enquiries in another billet  No invitation followed  On the contrary  Jeronymo wrote one line  wishing to see me in the morning   I had as little rest last night  as the night before  My impatience carried me to the palace of Porretta sooner than usual this morning   Signor Jeronymo rejoiced to see me  He hoped I did not take amiss  that they invited me not the day before  To say the truth  said he  the day s rest was judged entirely necessary for you both  For my sister particularly  And she was so uneasy and displeased at your going away on Saturday  without takeing leave of her  that she was the more easily persuaded not to see you yesterday  But already this Page  153 morning  I understand  she asks after you with impatience  You are angry at her  she supposes  and will never see her more  You had but just left us  on Saturday night  when Camilla came down with her request to see you  For my part  proceeded he  my thoughts are so much carried out of myself  by the extraordinary turn she has taken  that  at times  I forget I ail any thing   He then asked  if I could forgive his sister  and reflected on the Sex  on her account  as never knowing their own minds  but when they meet with obstacles to their wills  But she must  she will  be yours  my Grandison  said he  and if it please God to restore her  she will make you rich amends   The Bishop and Father Marescotti came in  to make their morning compliments to Jeronymo  The Marquis and Count entered soon after  to salute me   The Marchioness followed them  Clementina was so uneasy on Saturday night  said she to me  on finding you gone without taking leave of her  and so much discomposed all day yesterday  that I chose not to say any thing to her on the great article  I am glad you are come   Somebody just then tapping at the door  Come in  Camilla  said the Marchioness   It is not Camilla  it is I  said Lady Clementina  entering  I am told the Chevalier—O there he is—Favour me  Sir  with a few words—walking to a window at the other end of the room   I followed her  Tears were in her eyes  She looked earnestly at me  Then turning her face from me—Why  madam  said I  taking her hand  why this emotion  I have not  I hope  offended you   O Chevalier  I cannot bear to be slighted  and least of all by you  though  I must own  that I deserve it most from you  A slight from you is a charge of ingratitude upon me  that my heart cannot bear   Slight you  madam —I revere you  as the most Page  154 excellent of women  You have  indeed  filled my heart with anguish  But I admire you more for the cause of that anguish  than it is possible for me to express   Don t  don t say so  You will ruin me by your generosity  I think you must be angry with me  I think you must treat me ill  or how shall I keep my purpose   Your purpose  dearest madam —Your purpose   My purpose  Yes  Sir  Will it afflict you  if I do   Is it possible  madam  but it must  What would you think—  Hush  hush  my good Chevalier  I am afraid it will  But don t tell me it will  I cannot bear to afflict you   When I had the honour of every one s consent  madam—  That was in compassion to me  Sir   My dearest Love  said the Marquis  coming to us  that was at first our motive  But now an alliance with the Chevalier Grandison  in justice to his merits  is
