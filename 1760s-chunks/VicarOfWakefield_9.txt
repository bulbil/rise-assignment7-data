We had not much time to reflect upon the poor animal s distress   Page  43  when we perceived the dogs and horsemen come sweeping along at some distance behind  and making the very path it had taken  I was instantly for returning in with my family  but either curiosity or surprize  or some more hidden motive  held my wife and daughters to their seats  The huntsman  who rode foremost  past us with great swiftness  followed by four or five persons more  who seemed in equal haste  At last  a young gentleman of a more genteel appearance than the rest  came forward  and for a while regarding us  instead of pursuing the chace  stopt short  and giving his horse to a servant who attended  approached us with a careless superior air  He seemed to want no introduction  but was going to salute my daughters as one certain of a kind reception  but they had early learnt the lesson of looking presumption out of countenance  Upon which he let us know that his name was Thornhill  and that he was owner of the estate that lay for some extent round us  He again  therefore  offered to salute the female  Page  44  part of the family  and such was the power of fortune and fine cloaths  that he found no second repulse  As his address  though confident  was easy  we soon became more familiar  and perceiving musical instruments lying near  he begged to be favoured with a song  As I did not approve of such disproportioned acquaintances  I winked upon my daughters in order to prevent their compliance  but my hint was counteracted by one from their mother  so that with a chearful air they gave us a favourite song of Dryden s  Mr  Thornhill seemed highly delighted with their performance and choice  and then took up the guitar himself  He played but very indifferently  however  my eldest daughter repaid his former applause with interest  and assured him that his tones were louder than even those of her master  At this compliment he bowed  which she returned with a curtesy  He praised her taste  and she commended his understanding  an age could not have made them better acquainted  While the fond mother too  equally  Page  45  happy  insisted upon her landlord s stepping in  and tasting a glass of her gooseberry  The whole family seemed earnest to please him  my girls attempted to entertain him with topics they thought most modern  while Moses  on the contrary  gave him a question or two from the ancients  for which he had the satisfaction of being laughed at  for he always ascribed to his wit that laughter which was lavished at his simplicity  my little ones were no less busy  and fondly stuck close to the stranger  All my endeavours could scarce keep their dirty fingers from handling and tarnishing the lace on his cloaths  and lifting up the flaps of his pocket holes  to see what was there  At the approach of evening he took leave  but not till he had requested permission to renew his visit  which  as he was our landlord  we most readily agreed to   As soon as he was gone  my wife called a council on the conduct of the day  She was of opinion  that it was a most fortunate  Page  46  hit  for that she had known even stranger things at last brought to bear  She hoped again to see the day in which we might hold up our heads with the best of them  and concluded  she protested she could see no reason why the two Miss Wrinklers should marry great fortunes  and her children get none  As this last argument was directed to me  I protested I could see no reason for it neither  nor why one got the ten thousand pound prize in the lottery  and another sate down with a blank    But those    added I    who either aim at husbands greater than themselves  or at the ten thousand pound prize  have been fools for their ridiculous claims  whether successful or not     I protest  Charles    cried my wife    this is the way you always damp my girls and me when we are in Spirits  Tell me  Sophy  my dear  what do you think of our new visitor  Don t you think he seemed to be good natured    —   Immensely so  indeed  Mamma    replied she    I think he has a great deal to say upon every  Page  47  thing  and is never at a loss  and the more trifling the subject  the more he has to say  and what is more  I protest he is very handsome    —   Yes    cried Olivia    he is well enough for a man  but for my part  I don t much like him  he is so extremely impudent and familiar  but on the guitar he is shocking    These two last speeches I interpreted by contraries  I found by this  that Sophia internally despised  as much as Olivia secretly admired him —   Whatever may be your opinions of
