struck me dumb with shame   You see then  my dear  the filial duty  the duty of a reasonable and modest woman  were she even without parents or friends  forbids fancy to be her guide  as much as the sacred engagement of marriage forbids it to be her tormenter   But have there not been instances  said I  do not you and I know one  We did  in this neighbourhood  where a truly good woman was made miserable for years  by having her heart and hand differently engaged   Mrs  Eggleton reminded me  that there were  in that case  such extremely particular circumstances  as made it absurd to form from thence a general judgment  In almost every thing  said she  we act but upon probabilities  and one exception out of a thousand ought never to determine us  Even this exception in the case you hint at  is owing  in some measure  to a pitiable misguided imagination  Let us take our rules  my dear  from plain common sense  and not from poetical refinements   Say  my children  said the condescending parent  did my friend argue well   I think  madam  answered Kitty  she argued poor Love out of doors  She did not seem to allow the possibility of any person s being in Love at all   I told her so  replied my grandmamma   So far from it  said she  with a sigh  and a look expressive of the softest tenderness  that my own affections  as you know  were deeply engaged  The amiable youth  to whom I was to be united by marriage  died  His memory will ever be dear to my   208 heart  Love authorized by reasonable prospects  Love guided and heightened by duty  is every thing excellent that poets have said of it  Yet even this Love must submit to the awful dispensations of Providence  whether of death or other disappointment  and such trials ought to be met with chearful resignation  and not to be the means of embittering our lives  or of rendering them useless  And every thing we ought to do  be assured  my dear  we shall be enabled to do  if we set about it rightly  and with equal humility and trust  As for that kind of Love  which in its very beginning is contrary to Duty  to suppose that unconquerable  is making ourselves wretched indeed  And for first sight impressions  and beginning inclinations  though always dangerous  and often guilty to indulge  they are absolutely trifles to overcome and suppress  to a person of prudence and virtue   How we dwelt upon every sweet document that fell from the lips of the dear Mrs  Shirley   But now  Harriet  for the appeals  After all  were you  or were you not  a romantic girl  when you declared  that you never would be the wife of any man living  if you were not Sir Charles Gaandison s  even at the time when neither you nor we thought there could be any hopes of such a happy event —  But had we not  however  better appeal to Lady G  than to you  You were always so wise —Yet you could not be contented with the worthy Orme  You knew  instinctively  as I may say  that your kindred mind dwelt in St  James s Square  And Lady G  forty years hence will be looking back  I suppose  with wonder  on the time when she gave her then fair hand of swan skin  changed to buff   Her own slighty idea   with reluctance  to her deserving Lord  So  perhaps  we had best make no appeals at all  If we did  neither you nor she are at leisure now to answer them  Yet we have one appeal more to make  but   209 it must be to our Harriet  not to Lady G —Was not even our venerable parent a little too severe upon Old Maids  That wicked Nancy fell a laughing—Does she know what may be her own case  Here is a great parcel of girls of us—Have not I  her Elder  been crossed in Love already  But if no proper match ever offers  must we take an improper one  to avoid the ridicule of a mere name  An unsupported state is better than an oppressed  a miserable one  however  And how many rashly chosen husbands  and repentant wives  could I set against Nancy s Mrs  Arby —But the post is just going out  so that  far from entering on so copious a subject  I have barely time to add  that I am  with the truest affection  my dearest creature   Your faithful LUCY   LETTER XLIII  Lady G  To Lady GRANDISON    Thursday  April 12   I AM very well—What s the matter with the woman —I will write —Fifteen days controul and candle—Why surely —  They are impertinent  my dear  and would take my pen and ink from me —  YOU do well  Harriet  to throw upon me your self condemning task   How conscious you are  when you tell me  before you know my opinion of the contents of Lucy
