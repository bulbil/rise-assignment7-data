thoughts at   work to accomplish the gratification of this passion on my own   base terms      To bring this design to perfection  it was necessary that I should   get her fortune entirely into my power   which I accordingly formed   schemes to accomplish without delay   for the success of my former   attempt  so far from satisfying my avarice  or raising any sense of   compassion in my breast for her wrongs  had made me look upon   herself and all that belonged to her as my property  which I waa   as impatient to possess as if it was detained from me by injustice      I therefore took occasion one day  when we were alone together    to drop some words of concern at my not having immediately by   me a sum of money to lay out on most advantageous terms  which   had been that very morning proposed to me      She directly took the hint  and said her little fortune was still   in her hands  in the same bank notes I had given her   and if the   use of it  for any time  could be of advantage to me  she should feel   a greater pleasure in my taking it than any profit she could make   of it any other way      This was just what I wished   and though I could scarce refrain   from laughing at the easiness with which she took the bait  I would         ADVENTURES OP A GUINEA 1      not accept of her offer but with this restriction â€”  that I would con    Bider whether the terms proposed to me might not suit her  and   be more advantageous than the interest I could afford her if I should   make use of it myself  I said this with an equivocal smile  which   she understood as I would have her  and immediately  with an   assenting blush  put the notes into my hand  without requiring a   receipt or any kind of acknowledgment for them      Haying thus gained that which I reckoned the better part of   Amelia  and sure  as I imagined  of herself when necessity should   humble her to my designs  as I had her whole means even of sub    sistence in my power  I directly resolved to close with an offer some   tune before made me by a wealthy merchant of a large fortune with   his daughter   whom I accordingly married a few days after I had   got possession of Amelia s money      I shall spare myself the pains of any further description of my   wife than that she was the very reverse of Amelia in soul and body     and my marriage consequently as unhappy as I justly deserved      But I comforted myself with hopes of happiuess in the enjoyment   of Amelia  whom I looked upon as my own  and only deferred mak    ing my base proposals to  till her resentment at my marriage should   cool and I could devise some plan of privacy to elude the vigilance   of my wife  Not but I dreaded the first emotion of her anger    which I expected to break out in loud complaints  But I was   mistaken in measuring her soul thus by my own  She scorned   to complain   nor did I hear a word from her to interrupt the riot   of my wedding   a greatness of soul so far above my comprehension   that I attributed it to fear of giving offence to one in whose power   she must be sensible she was      But at the end of the month I was awoke from those dreams by   a message from her  delivered by a relation of hers  to desire I   should pay in her money to him  for which he would give me a   receipt  As I was not prepared for this  I believe it threw me into   a confusion too visible   but I soon recovered presence of mind   enough to answer that   I could not but be surprised at such a   demand  as Amelia must be sensible that I had paid her all the   money of hers that was in my hands  for which I had her discharge   in full       The gentleman replied in astonishment     Her discharge  sir     That was when you settled her affairs   but she says that she since   then gave her whole fortune iuto your hands to lay out for her    And  sir  my cousin is known to be neither a fool nor a liar  though   I believe she has suffered severely for her ill placed confidence          Perhaps she says so  sir   said I    but I know nothing of the
