of a prince  to punish for   what and whom he will  to be the sovereign  not only of property  but   of life  and to govern alike without prescription or appeal        HAMET  who was struck with astonishment at this declaration  and the   vehemence with which it was uttered  after a short recollection made   this reply   It is the glory of a prince  to govern others  as he is   governed by Him  who is alone most merciful and almighty  It is his   glory to prevent crimes  rather than to display his power in punishment    to diffuse happiness  rather than inforce subjection  and rather to   animate with love  than depress by fear  Has not He that shall judge us    given us a rule of life by which we shall be judged  is not our reward   and punishment already set before us  are not His promises and   threatenings  motives to obedience  and have we not confidence and joy    when we have obeyed  To God  His own divine perfections are a law  and   these He has transcribed as a law to us  Let us  then  govern  as we are   governed  let us seek our happiness in the happiness that we bestow  and   our honour in emulating the benevolence of Heaven        As ALMORAN feared  that to proceed farther in this argument would too   far disclose his sentiments  and put HAMET too much upon his guard  he   determined for the present to dissemble  and as he perceived  that   HAMET S opinion  and an administration founded upon it  would render him   extreamly popular  and at length possibly establish him alone  he was   now felicitous only to withdraw him from public notice  and persuade him   to leave the government  whatever form it should receive  to be   administered by others  returning  therefore  to his seat  and assuming   an appearance of complacence and tranquillity  with which he could not   form his language perfectly to agree   Let us then   said he   if a law   must be set up in our stead  leave the law to be executed by our slaves    and as nothing will be left for us to do  that is worthy of us  let us   devote ourselves to the pleasures of ease  and if there are any   enjoyments peculiar to royalty  let us secure them as our only   distinction from the multitude         Not so   says HAMET   for there is yet much for a prince to do  after   the best system of laws has been established  the government of a nation   as a whole  the regulation and extent of its trade  the establishment of   manufactories  the encouragement of genius  the application of the   revenues  and whatever can improve the arts of peace  and secure   superiority in war  is the proper object of a king s attention        But in these   said ALMORAN   it will be difficult for two minds to   concur  let us  then  agree to leave these also to the care of some   other  whom we can continue as long as we approve  and displace when we   approve no longer  we shall  by this expedient  be able to avert the   odium of any unpopular measure  and by the sacrifice of a slave  we can   always satisfy the people  and silence public discontent         To trust implicitly to another   says HAMET   is to give up a   prerogative  which is at once our highest duty and interest to keep  it   is to betray our trust  and to sacrifice our honour to another  The   prince  who leaves the government of his people implicitly to a subject    leaves it to one  who has many more temptations to betray their interest   than himself  a vicegerent is in a subordinate station  he has    therefore  much to rear  and much to hope  he may also acquire the power   of obtaining what he hopes  and averting what he rears  at the public   expence  he may stand in need of dependents  and may be able no   otherwise to procure them  than by conniving at the fraud or the   violence which they commit  he may receive  in bribes  an equivalent for   his share  as an individual  in the public prosperity  for his interest   is not essentially connected with that of the state  he has a separate   interest  but the interest of the state  and of the king  are one  he   may even be corrupted to betray the councils  and give up the interests   of the nation  to a foreign power
