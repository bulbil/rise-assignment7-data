 that I got to my Aunt s  She has behaved with great Care and Tenderness  the Want of which must have added greatly to my Sufferings  if not immediately endangered mine  and the poor Bab s Life  As to the Noise  I must compound for it  and endeavour to bear with one Inconvenience  where there are so many Conveniencies   I cannot help telling you  that I think our Friends in — have behaved very ill to you  I had no Claim to their Friendship or Regard  but I think they should have rejoiced in any Opportunity of shewing their Gratitude and Affection to so near a Relation  and kind a Benefactor  The Particulars of their Conduct I refer to our Meeting  which I hope and believe will be soon  Observe  that I have never seemed to take the least Notice of their Behaviour  nor shewn any kind of Picque or Resentment at it  By this you may perceive  your Example has not been thrown away  I strive to copy it  though convinced I shall never  in any Thing  arrive at the same Degree of Perfection  and  I assure you  I scarce engage in the most trifling Action  without asking myself  would my Harry  if present  approve my doing so  or  how would he act in the same Circumstances  So really anxious am I to become thy Epitome   I hope I shall keep up a little longer  to gather Strength and Spirits for the approaching Page  265 Aera  and that Bab and I may live to thank you for the kind Assurances of your present and future Regard  Adieu   Frances   LETTER CCLXXXVII   My Dear FANNY   I HAVE this Day begun my great Buildings   c  The Boldness of my Undertakings  with the amazing Success of my Atchievements  surprizes even myself  but is a Matter of miraculous Wonder to the rest of the World  Yet it is impossible to conceive  without having tried  how much may be compassed by the Help of a little Thought  Spirit  and Perseverance  referring the Success ultimately to Providence  which has hitherto  in a good Hour be it spoken  favourably attended every one of my bold and desperate Undertakings  So prosper me still  as I mean Honour to you  my truest Love  and to your Children  for whom I begin already to feel a Father s Fondness  say rather a Grandfather s  for I have always behaved to you  as to a favourite Child  cherishing you for your own Advantage  and thwarting you only for your Good   Page  266The Compliment  you make  of setting me for your Example  is higher than my Merits  You need no better Pattern than the fair Exemplar in your own Mind  whenever you are pleased to reflect your own Thoughts upon it  and for this Purpose  if you consider me as your Monitor only  it will be the highest Favour  I shall pretend to   Adieu   my sweet Pupil   LETTER CCLXXXVIII   I DID not receive your s of the 9th   till a few Hours ago  This Delay  joined to your late Silence  threw me into a Situation very little short of Distraction  I have not slept two Hours at a Time since Thursday  and have almost blinded myself with crying  As you have been always so exactly punctual in writing  I must say it was unkind to miss a Post at this particular Time  My Spirits  weakened and worn out by bodily Pain  sunk under the most dismal Apprehensions  I imagined you had met with some dreadful Accident  or  at best  concluded that your Uncle had intercepted my Letters  Heaven be praised  my Fears were groundless  But let me intreat you  my dear Harry  to write constantly for the future  though your Leisure should afford but a single Line  I know you Page  267 think it extremely silly to be uneasy on such Occasions  but indeed I cannot help it  and must therefore beg your Indulgence to this particular Weakness   As I am sure all your Undertakings are founded on Reason and Virtue  it would be arraigning Providence to doubt their Success  May he ever bless  prosper  and preserve my Love  and then  tho  he afflict me  I shall not complain   I am not offended at your making so light of my present Sufferings    Thou canst not speak of what thou dost not feel   But I am affronted  you take no Notice of my favourite Elfrida  If you do not like it  let me beg you not to tell me so  for I am vain enough to fancy there is a strong Parity between her Sentiments and mine     Adieu   my dearest Life   Frances   LETTER CCLXXXIX   My Dear FANNY   INCLOSE you this Paper  because it relates to the Subject of one of my late Letters  about Reading  I send it to you more for your Amusement  than Instruction  as you need no Hint of this Kind  Nor  indeed  do I think Page  268 Reading itself any otherwise necessary to my charming Philosopher  than to direct or adapt your Thoughts to proper Studies
