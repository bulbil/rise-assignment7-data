she said he had before been intrusted with the care of a pupil  whom I presumed to be a person of fortune  as scarce any others are sent to travel   She said  he had a small patrimony of his own  and that his original design was to study physic  but being persuaded by the love he bore a young gentleman  to whom he was private tutor at the university  to go abroad with him  he had for some years  while they continued on their travels  been obliged to decline this study  When he had brought his pupil safe back to England  he intended to pursue it  and for this purpose was preparing to go to Leyden  but the gentleman  who really had an affection for him  declared he could not part with him  and that if he would consent to stay and take holy orders  he would get him a living which was in his father’s gift  a nobleman then alive   as soon as it should become vacant  of which there was a good prospect  on account of the age of the incumbent  and that in the mean time he should live with him  As the young gentleman had been married immediately after his return from his travels to a lady of vast fortune  and was settled with a family of his own about him  my father who fondly loved him  did not disrelish the proposal  and without much difficulty consented to it  He now laid aside the thoughts of physic  and turned his attention to the study of divinity  nor was he in haste for the promised living’s being vacated  as he was resolved not to take orders till he was properly qualified for the holy profession he was now destined to  He continued thus four years with    his young patron  the gentleman who possessed the living  though very sickly still holding it   My father then being inclined to go into orders  his friend got him nominated to a cure in town  the duties of which he constantly performed for two years  still living with his benefactor  but it was his misfortune then to lose him  He was drowned in crossing a deep water on horse back which he thought was fordable  My poor father had now lost  as it proved  his only friend  though he then lamented him as a son he loved  and I have heard him say he was more afflicted for his death  than his real father was   As that nobleman was well acquainted with his son’s intentions in regard to his tutor  my father had no doubts of his fulfilling them  especially as he had given his promise to do so  About this time the curate of the parish in Berkshire which I mentioned to you before  having a mind to make an exchange for one in London where all his friends lived  proposed it to my father who had been at college with him  As he had now no attachment in town  and preferred a country life  he readily agreed to the change  and having first waited on the father of his late friend to remind him of his promise  which he again confirmed  he went down to Berkshire  Here it was he fell in love with my mother  who was the daughter of the rector whose cure he served  she liked him  and as her father looked upon him as a man certain of preferment  and every way esteemable in his character  he did not scruple to give her to him   In a few months after their marriage  the incumbent of the long promised living died   My father immediately waited on the nobleman  so sure of success that he thought he should have nothing to do but to thank him for it  but that Lord told him with a pretended concern  that he had disposed of it  having heard that my father was well provided for in Berkshire  and had married a lady of great fortune   He returned home shocked and disappointed  more on account of the family he had married into  than on his own  He now found himself at near forty years of age  with a family coming on him  and no other provision than a curacy of forty pounds a year  My grandfather pretended he had been deceived by him  and made that excuse for withdrawing all his favour from him  My mother had children pretty fast  but they all died young excepting myself  and as he loved her too well to let her feel the inconvenience of streightened circumstances  he was content to let his own little patrimony  which    he had preserved till now  gradually waste  for my grandfather never gave her any fortune  At his death  which happened a few years after  it appeared he could not  for he left but little behind him  In this situation  my father having lost all hopes of being better provided for  with the melancholy reflexion of having thrown away the best part of his days in a fruitless attendance and expectation  dragged on a life of obscurity and toil for eleven years  and then it was that Mr Ware applied to him in the manner I have mentioned   I told this amiable girl  I was glad I had interrupted the thread of her story  as
