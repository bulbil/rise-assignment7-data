in a large chest that stood there to hold the orna    ments and utensils of the table  when the society was away  To   the spring of the look of this chest he fastened a cord  which he drew   under the carpet that was on the floor to his own seat  and there   brought the end of it through a hole made for that purpose  in such   a manner that he could readily find it   and  by giving it a pull    open the chest  and let the baboon loose whenever he pleased    without being perceived by any of the rest of the company  Ac    cordingly  when they were all in the height of their mirth  on my   master s kneeling down  and with hands and eyes raised towarito   heaven  repeating an invocation  in the perverted phraseof Holy Writ    to the Being whom they served  to come among them  and receive   their adorations in person  he pulled the cord  and let the animal   loose  who  glad to be delivered from his confinement  gave a sudden   spring upon the middle of the table      The efiect which the sight of such a visitor had upon them may   be better conceived than expressed  Their attention had been   80 fixed upon what my master was saying  that they perceived not   from whence he came   and his appearing so critically at the in    vocation  and in such a shape  made them conclude he was the   Being invoked  Terrified out of their senses by this thought    they all roared out with one voice    The devil   the devil     and   starting from their seats  made directly towards the door  tumbling   over one another  and oversetting everything in their way      In the height of this uproar and confusion  the baboon  frightened   at the effects of their fear  happened to leap upon my master s    shoulders  as he lay sprawling on the floor   who  turning about   his head at feeling the shock  saw the animal grinning horribly at   him  and concluded the devil had obeyed his summons in good   earnest  and come to carry him bodily away  Driven as he was   to despair by this thought  he strove  however  in the instinctive   impulse of self preservation  to shake off the invader   but he    instead of loosing his hold on his repeated efforts  only clung to   him the closer  clasping his paws around his neck  and chattering   with spite at his ear  This completed the caitiff s distress  Every   shadow of spirit failed him  and conscious guilt suggesting to him   the meaning of this unintelligible jargon  he attempted  in the   blindness of fear  to move the very devil to pity  by his pathetic   waitings and supplications        Spare me  gracious devil     said he     spare a wretch who never   was sincerely your servant   I siimed only from vanity of being   in the fashion   Thou knowest I never have been half so wicked   as I pretended   never have been able to commit the thousandth   part of the vices which I have boasted of  Take not  then  the   advantage of that vanity   but judge me only from my actions    I knew not that thou wouldst have come  or I should never have       Lord Sandwich          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 389     invoked thee   leave me  therefore  and go to those who are more   truly devoted to thy service  I am but half a sinner  My conscience   always flew in my face when I commited any crime   my heart gave   the lie to my tongue  when I gloried in my vices   and I trembled   at the damnation I affected to brave   Oh  spare me  therefore  at   least for this time  till I have served thee better  I am as yet but   half a sinner            CHAPTER XXI     THE DEVIL IS DEGEADBD TO A BABOON  AND HIS APPEARANCE WELL   ACCOUNTED FOE  WHICH EESTOEES THE MIETH AND COUEAGE OF   THE COMPANY  AND PAETICULAELY OF CHEYSAL s MASTBE  V7H0   EXEETS HIMSELF TO EECOVEE HIS CHAEACTBE â€” THE APPEAEANOB   OF THE BE DBVILLED BABOON IS TEACED NEXT DAY TO HIS INTEO    DUCEE  WKO AT THE INSTANCE OF CICEYSAL s MASTEE IS EXPELLED   THE SOCIETY  FOE PEESUMING TO EIDICULB THBIE EITES â€” FUETHBB   CONSEQUBNCBS OF THIS AFFAIE MAKE THE SUPEEIOE BEBAK ITP   HIS MONASTERY  AND BUILD A CHUECH     While my master was making this
