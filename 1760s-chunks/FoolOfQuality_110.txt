loosed to their own delight in burnings  rapines  slaughters    howlings  and violations   is it the perpetrators of all these horrors   that you compassionate  when they happen to be crushed in the   ruins they have wrought  Meritorious  my Arabella  most meri    torious were that hand who should cut a whole host of such infernals   from the earth   remaining innocence and virtue would be his   debtors for ever  Commiseration to the flagitious is cruelty to the   just   and he who spares them becomes the accomplice of all their   future crimes      During tea  my wife gave me an ample narrative of all that   happened at our house while I was in confinement  As she spoke  I   was first speechless with fearful and panting expectation   I was then   kindled into fury and a vehement thirst of vengeance   and  lastly  I   was elevated into an awful rapture  I looked at my wife with eyes   swimming with love and veneration   I rose from my seat   I threw   myself on my knees  and worshipped that GODHEAD who inspires   and delights in such perfections as I then saw before me      Our fortune was now reduced to very little more than fifteen   guineas  We had no clothes but what we wore   and we did not   dare to go or send to our house for others  neither to make our    selves known to any acquaintance      We went by the name of Stapleton   and on the following night   I ventured abroad  and bought for myself a few second hand shirts    with a common gown  and some changes of linen for my wife      On the fifth day  at breakfast  while Arabella was casting her   eye over a newspaper that she had borrowed from Mrs  Jennett    she turned suddenly pale  What  she cried  before I could question   her  accused of robbery as well as murder   that is hard  indeed    But I trust that my lot shall not exceed my resignation  And so   saying  she handed me over the paper with a smile  in which heaven   appeared to open      The advertisement ran thus  WHEEEAS Arabella Clement    alias Graves  did on the 15th day of September instant  most bar    barously stab and murder the right Hon  James          late Lord   Stivers  at a house where she formerly had kept a milliner s shop          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  93     in Fleet street   and whereas she did further rob the said right hon     c  of a large purse of money  his gold repeater  snuff box  diamond    ring   c    and did  lastly  flee for the same  as may be proved  and   is evident  from the examination and testimony of three concurring   witnesses   Now his majesty  in his gracious abhorrence of such   crimes  doth hereby promise a reward of three hundred guineas to   any person who shall stop  discover  or arrest the said Arabella  so   as that she may be brought to condign and adequate punishment  if   any such may be found  for such unequalled offences       O  said my wife  I perceive that my enemies will swear home   indeed   Their plunder of Lord Stivers can no way be assured save   by my condemnation  But  be it as it may   that Providence  who   overrules the wickedness of this world  may yet give submission a   clue to escape its perplexities  and my innocence  I trust  will be an   equivalent to all that the world can inflict  and much more than an   equivalent to all that it can bestow      I now had every thing to fear for my Arabella  as well from the   interested villainy of the witnesses  as from the power of the   ministry  and the resentment of the relations of so great a man   and   I looked upon her death to be as certain as her caption  Had I   been the first in remainder to the greatest estate in England  I   would have exchanged my whole interest for as much ready cash as   would have served to convey us to some region of safety  But this   was not practicable with the very small remainder of the wreck of   our fortune   and we had taken our lodging certain at fifty shillings   per quarter      We appeared as little as possible  even to the lodgers of the   house   and I intimated to my landlady  that it was the fate of   many a gentleman
