 so perfect  as the observations   67 of the genius s of after times  which were built upon their foundations  made them  and they others  Learning  or knowlege  as you choose to call it  was a progressive thing  And it became necessary to understand the different languages in which the sages of antiquity wrote  in order to avail ourselves of their learning   Very right  Sir  I believe  You consider skill in languages then as a vehicle to knowlege—Not  I presume  as science itself   I was sorry the Baronet laughed  because his laughing made it more difficult for me to get off  as I wanted to do   Pray  Sir Hargrave  said Mr  Walden  let not every thing that is said be laughed at  I am fond of talking to this young Lady  And a conversation upon this topic may tend as much to edification  perhaps  as most of the subjects with which we have been hitherto entertained   Sir Hargrave took an empty glass  and with it humourously rapped his own knuckles  bowed  smiled  and was silent  by that act of yielding  which had gracefulness in it  gaining more honour to himself  than Mr  Walden obtained by his rebuke of him  however just   But this humourous acknowlegement hindered not Mr  Walden from shewing  by a nod  given with an assuming air  that he thought he had obtained a victory over the Baronet  And then he again applied himself to me   Now  madam  if you please  and he put himself into a disputing attitude  a word or two with you  on your vehicle  and so sorth   Pray spare me  Sir  I am willing to sit down quietly  I am unequal to this subject  I have done   But  said the Baronet  you must not sit down quietly  madam  Mr  Walden has promised us edification  and we all attend the effect of his promise     68 No  no  madam  said Mr  Walden  you must not come off so easily  You have thrown out some extraordinary things for a Lady  and especially for so young a Lady  From you we expect the opinions of your worthy grandfather  as well as your own notions  He no doubt told you  or you have read  that the competition set on foot between the learning of the antients and moderns  has been the subject of much debate among the learned in the latter end of the last century   Indeed  Sir  I know nothing of the matter  I am not learned  My grandfather was chiefly intent to make me an English  and  I may say  a Bible scholar  I was very young when I had the misfortune to lose him  My whole endeavour has been since  that the pains he took with me  should not be cast away   I have discovered you  madam  to be a Parthian Lady  You can fight flying  I see  You must not  I tell you  come off so easily for what you have thrown out  Let me ask you  Did you ever read The Tale of a Tub   The Baronet laughed out  tho  evidently in the wrong place   How apt are laughing spirits  said Mr  Walden  looking solemnly  to laugh  when perhaps they ought—There he stopt— to be laugh d at  I suppose he had in his head   But I will not  however  be laugh d out of my question—Have you  madam  read Swift s Tale of a Tub —There is such a book  Sir Hargrave  looking with a leer of contempt at the Baronet   I know there is  Mr  Walden  replied the Baronet  and again laughed—Have you  madam  to me  Pray let us know  what Mr  Walden drives at   I have  Sir   Why then  madam  resumed Mr  Walden  you no doubt read  bound up with it  The Battle of the Books  a very fine piece  written in favour of the antients  and against the moderns  and thence must be   69 acquainted with the famous dispute I mentioned  And this will shew you  that the moderns are but pygmies in science compared to the antients  And  pray  shall not the knowlege which enables us  to understand and to digest the wisdom of these immortal antients  be accounted learning —Pray  madam  nodding his head  answer me that   O how these pedants  whispered Sir Hargrave to Mr  Reeves  strut in the livery and brass buttons of the antients  and call their servility  learning   You are going beyond my learning  or capacity  Sir  I must agree  that the knowlege which enables us to comprehend the wisdom of the antients  and to be improved by it  deserves to be called learning  Yet the antients may be read  I suppose  and not understood —But pray  Sir  let the Parthian fly the field  I promise you that she will not return to the charge  Escape  not victory  is all she contends for   All in good time
