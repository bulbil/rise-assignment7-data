difficulty mounted  and being now much nearer to me  he told me he would receive me  if I could contrive to get down to him   My poor father hastily kissed  and blessed me  and having my apparatus ready for descending  he had the farther precaution to fix some strong ribbons  which I had tied together for the purpose under my arms  these he held in his hands  whilst I slid down by the sheets which I had fastened together corner ways with a knot   The trusty watchman caught me in his arms  and lifted me over the pallisados  to his comrade  who set me safely down in the street   It was very dark  but I could distinguish when my father drew in the linen  and heard him shut the window  I then told my deliverer that I must beg a farther act of kindness from him  which was to see me safe to the street where I wanted to go   He readily complied  and leaving it to his comrade to carry away the plank  took me under the arm  and we got without being molested to the mantua maker’s house  The family were all in bed  when after repeated knocking  a maid looked out of an upper window  and asked us what we wanted  I told her an acquaintance of her mistress had urgent business with her  and begged she would step down and speak to me from the parlour window  After keeping me a long while waiting  she at length came down  I then gave the watchman the other guinea I had promised him  and dismissed him  very well pleased with his night’s adventure   After he was gone  I told the woman my name  and begged she would let me come in  which she immediately did  I without scruple acquainted her with the manner of my escape  and the occasion of it  she was shocked and affected with my story  and promised to keep me concealed till my father should come to carry me to some place of greater safety  for she said  as Mr Ware’s house keeper was her acquaintance I might be discovered at her house   This terrified me exceedingly  but the good natured woman gave    me the most solemn assurances that I should be safe for the short time she supposed I should stay with her  She invited me to part of her bed  as she told me she had never a spare one  and I readily accepted of her offer   I remained all the next day in the utmost grief and anxiety  at hearing nothing from my poor father  In the evening of the second day  a porter brought a letter to the mantua maker  which served only as a cover for a note directed to me  Seeing it writ in my father’s hand  I eagerly opened it  but oh  Madam  how shall I tell you my grief  and horror  when I saw it dated from a prison  My poor father told me  that our cruel persecutor  enraged at my escape  had charged my father with it  who immediately acknowleged he had assisted in delivering me from ruin  that Mr Ware  after treating him with the most injurious language  demanded payment of him for the sums he said he had lent him from time to time since his father’s death   To this my father making no other reply  than that Mr Ware knew he had it not in his power to refund any of that money  which  though it was a free gift  he would restore sooner than lie under any obligation to such a base man  the villain was barbarous enough to have him arrested  and sent to jail  where he said he should remain till his stubborn spirit should be glad to yield up his daughter to him   My father desired me to come to him directly  and to bring some body with me to protect me by the way  I instantly obeyed  and sending for a hackney coach  the mantua maker got her husband  a decent tradesman  and his apprentice to accompany me  We drove directly to my poor father’s melancholy habitation  where they delivered me safe into his hands  His joy at seeing me again  made him for a while forget the sorrows which surrounded us   He told me that after he had seen me get safe into the street  and had recommended me to the care of providence  he had put every thing out of the way which had assisted me in my escape  and putting out one of the candles left it in my room  that the house keeper  when she come up  might suppose me in bed  he then went to his own  He concluded that the woman  when she went into my room  supposed me asleep  Mr Ware was at home the whole evening  and had before that retired to rest  so that there was no discovery made that night   My father now informed me that Mr Ware had said  when he first made the odious proposal to him  that if I complied  he would allow    my father four hundred pounds a year  and settle the like sum upon me for life  at the same time  in case of refusal
