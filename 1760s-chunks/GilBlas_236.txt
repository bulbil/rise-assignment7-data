a speaking acquaintance with the muses  but never were of their private parties   Authors upon authors  nothing but authors  exclaimed he  pointing out two dashing blades  One would think they had made an appointment on purpose to pass in review before you  Don Bernardo Deslenguado and Don Sebastian of Villa Viciosa  The first is a vinegar flavoured vintage of Parnassus  a satirist by trade and company  he hates all the world  and is not liked the better for his taste  As for Don Sebastian  he is the milk and honey of criticism  he would not have the guilt of ill nature on his conscience for the universe  He has just brought out a comedy without a single idea  which has succeeded with an audience of tantamount ideas  and he has just now published it to vindicate his innocence   Gongora s candid pupil was running on in his career of benevolent explanation  when one of the Duke de Medina Sidonia s household came up and said  Signor Don Fabricio  my lord duke wishes to speak with you  You will find him at home  Nunez  who knew that the wishes of a great lord could not be too soon gratified  left me without ceremony  but he left me in the utmost consternation  to hear him called Don  and thus ennobled  in spite of master Chrysostom the barber s escutcheon  who had the honour to call him father       CH  XIV     Fabricio finds a situation for Gil Blas in the establishment of Count Galiano  a Sicilian nobleman   I WAS too happy in Fabricio s society  not to bunt him out again early the next morning  Good day to you  Signor Don Fabricio  said I on my first approach  it seems you are the picked and chosen flower  or rather  saving your presence  the nondescript excrescence of the Asturian nobility  This sarcasm had no other effect than to set him laughing heartily  Then the title of Don was not lost upon you  exclaimed he  No  indeed  my noble lord  answered I  and you will give me leave to tell you that when you were recounting your transformations to me yesterday  you forgot the most extraordinary  Exactly so  replied he  but to speak sincerely  if I have taken up that prefix of dignity  it is less to tickle my own vanity  than in tenderness to that of others  You know what stuff the Spaniards are made of  an honest man is no honest man to them  if his honour is not bolstered up with escutcheons  pedigree  and patrimony  I may tell you  moreover  that there are so many gentry  and very queer soft of gentry too  dubbed Don Francisco  Don Pedro  Don What do you call him  or Don Devil  that if they owe their coats of arms to any herald but their own impudence  modern nobility is a mere drug in the market  so that a plebeian of nature s ennobling confers infinite honour on the upstarts of nn artificial creation  by herding with their order   But let us change the subject  added he  Last night  supping at the Duke de Medina Sidonia s  with among other company we had Count Galiano  a great Sicilian nobleman  the conversation turned upon the ridiculous effects of self love  Delighted at having a case in point by way of illustration  I treated them with the story of the homilies  You may well suppose that there was a hearty laugh  and that the archbishop s dignity was not saved in the concussion  but the effect was not amiss for you  since the company felt for your situation  and Count Galiano  after a long string of questions  which of course I answered to your advantage  commissioned me to introduce you  I was just now going to look after you for that purpose  In all probability he means to offer you a situation as one of his secretaries  I advise you not to hang back  The count is rich  and lives away at Madrid  on the scale of an ambassador  He is said to have come to court on a negotiation with the Duke of Lerma  respecting some crown lands which that minister thinks of alienating in Sicily  In one word  Count Galiano  though a Sicilian  has every feature of generosity  fair dealing  and gentlemanly conduct  You cannot do better than get upon that noble man s establishment  In all probability  the flattering prophecy respecting you at Grenada is to be fulfilled in his person   It was my full determination  said I to Nunez  to take my swing about town and look at men and manners a little  before the harness was buckled on my back again  but you paint your Sicilian nobleman in colours which fascinate my imagination and change my purpose  I should like to close with him at once  You will do so very soon  replied he  or I am much deceived  We sallied forth together immediately  and went to the count s  who resided in the house of his friend  Don Sancho d Avila  the latter being then in the country   The court yard was overrun with pages and footmen in rich and elegant liveries  while the ante
