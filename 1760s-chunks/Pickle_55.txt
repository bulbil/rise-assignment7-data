 and  indeed  the augmentation of the one was   in all probability  owing to the decrease of the other  for the  two ladies  with great civility  performed all the duties of good  neighbourhood  and hated each other most piously in their hearts   Mrs  Pickle  having been disobliged at the splendour of her sister s  new equipage  had  ever since that time  in the course of her visiting   endeavoured to make people merry with satirical jokes on the poor lady s  infirmities  and Mrs  Trunnion seized the very first opportunity of  making reprisals  by inveighing against her unnatural behaviour to her  own child  so that Peregrine  as on the one hand he was abhorred  so  on the other was he caressed  in consequence of this contention  and I  firmly believe that the most effectual method of destroying his interest  at the garrison  would have been the show of countenancing him at  his father s house  but  whether this conjecture be reasonable or  chimerical  certain it is the experiment was never tried  and therefore  Mr  Peregrine ran no risk of being disgraced  The commodore  who  assumed  and justly too  the whole merit of his education  was now as  proud of the youth s improvements as if he had actually been his  own offspring  and sometimes his affection rose to such a pitch of  enthusiasm  that he verily believed him to be the issue of his own  loins  Notwithstanding this favourable predicament in which our hero  stood with his aunt and her husband  he could not help feeling the  injury he suffered from the caprice of his mother  and though the gaiety  of his disposition hindered him from afflicting himself with reflections  of any gloomy cast  he did not fail to foresee  that if any sudden  accident should deprive him of the commodore  he would in all likelihood  find himself in a very disagreeable situation  Prompted by this    6 22 15  3 45 PM   consideration  he one evening accompanied his uncle to the club  and  was introduced to his father  before that worthy gentleman had the least  inkling of his arrival   Mr  Gamaliel was never so disconcerted as at this reencounter  His own  disposition would not suffer him to do anything that might create  the least disturbance  or interrupt his enjoyment  so strongly was he  impressed with the terror of his wife  that he durst not yield to  the tranquility of his temper  and  as I have already observed  his  inclination was perfectly neutral  Thus distracted between different  motives  when Perry was presented to him  he sat silent and absorbed   as if he did not or would not perceive the application  and when he was  urged to declare himself by the youth  who pathetically begged to know  how he had incurred his displeasure  he answered  in a peevish strain    Why  good now  child  what would you have me to do  your mother can t  abide you     If my mother is so unkind  I will not call it unnatural    said Peregrine  the tears of indignation starting from his eyes   as  to banish me from her presence and affection  without the least cause  assigned  I hope you will not be so unjust as to espouse her barbarous  prejudice    Before Mr  Pickle had time to reply to his expostulation  for which  he was not at all prepared  the commodore interposed  and enforced his  favourite s remonstrance  by telling Mr  Gamaliel that he was ashamed to  see any man drive in such a miserable manner under his wife s petticoat    As for my own part   said he  raising his voice  and assuming a look of  importance and command   before I would suffer myself to be steered  all weathers by any woman in Christendom  d ye see  I d raise such  a hurricane about her ears  that    Here he was interrupted by Mr   Hatchway  who thrusting his head towards the door  in the attitude of  one that listens  cried   Ahey  there s your spouse come to pay us a  visit   Trunnion s features that instant adopted a new disposition  fear  and confusion took possession of his countenance  his voice  from a tone  of vociferation  sank into a whisper of   Sure  you must be mistaken   Jack   and  in great perplexity  he wiped off his sweat which had  started on his forehead at this false alarm  The lieutenant  having thus  punished him for the rodomontade he had uttered  told him  with an arch  sneer  that he was deceived with the sound of the outward door creaking  upon its hinges  which he mistook for Mrs  Trunnion s voice  and desired  him to proceed with his admonitions to Mr  Pickle  It is not to be  denied that this arrogance was a little unseasonable to the commodore   who was in all respects as effectually subdued to the
