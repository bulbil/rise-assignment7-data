was willing to indulge himself   Never was there a more grateful family  The noble father was uneasy  because he know not how to acknowlege  according to the largeness of his heart to a man in genteel circumstances  the obligation laid upon them all  The mother  with a freedom more amiably great than the Italian Ladies are accustomed to express  bid her Clementina regard as her fourth brother  the preserver of the third  The Barone declared  that he should never rest  nor recover  till he had got me rewarded in such manner as all the world should think I had honour done me in it   When the Barone was removed to Bologna  the   179 whole family were studious to make occasions to get me among them  The General made me promise  when my relations  as he was pleased to express himself  at Bologna  could part with me  to give him my company at Naples  The Bishop  who passed all the time he had to spare from his diocese  at Bologna  and who is a learned man  in compliment to his fourth brother  would have me initiate him into the knowlege of the English tongue   Our Milton has deservedly a name among them  The friendship that there was between him and a learned nobleman of their country  endeared his memory to them  Milton  therefore  was a principal author with us  Our lectures were usually held in the chamber of the wounded brother  in order to divert him  He also became my scholar  The father and mother were often present  and at such times their Clementina was seldom absent  She also called me her tutor  and  tho  she was not half so often present at the lectures as they were  made a greater proficiency than either of her brothers    Do you doubt it  Lucy    The father  as well as the Bishop  is learned  the mother well read  She had had the benefit of a French education  being brought up by her uncle  who resided many years at Paris in a public character  And her daughter had  under her own eye  advantages in her education which are hardly ever allowed or sought after by the Italian Ladies  In such company  you may believe  madam  that I  who was kept abroad against my wishes  passed my time very agreeably  I was particularly honoured with the confidence of the Marchioness  who opened her heart to me  and consulted me on every material occurrence  Her Lord  who is one of the politest of men  was never better pleased than when he found us together  and not seldom  tho  we were not engaged in lectures  the fair   180 Clementina claimed a right to be where her mother was   About this time  the young Count of Belvedere returned to Parma  in order to settle in his native country  His father was a favourite in the court of the princess of Parma  and attended that Lady to Madrid  on her marriage with the late king of Spain  where he held a very considerable post  and lately died there immensely rich  On a visit to this noble family  the young Lord saw  and loved Clementina   The Count of Belvedere is a handsome  a gallant  a sensible man  his fortune is very great  Such an alliance was not to be slighted  The Marquis gave his countenance to it  The Marchioness favoured me with several conversations upon the subject  She was of opinion  perhaps  that it was necessary to know my thoughts  on this occasion  for the younger brother  unknown to me  declared  that he thought there was no way of rewarding my merits to the family  but by giving me a relation to it  Dr  Bartlett  madam  can shew you  from my Letters to him  some conversations  which will convince you  that in Italy  as well as in other countries  there are persons of honour  of goodness  of generosity  and who are above reserve  vindictiveness  jealousy  and those other bad passions by which some persons mark indiscriminately a whole nation   For my own part  it was impossible  distinguished as I was by every individual of this noble family  and lovely as is this daughter of it  mistress of a thousand good qualities  and myself absolutely disengaged in my affections  that my vanity should not sometimes be awakened  and a wish arise  that there might be a possibility of obtaining such a prize  But I checked the vanity  the moment I could find it begin to play about and warm my heart  To have attempted to recommend myself to the young Lady s favour  tho    181 but by looks  by assiduities  I should have thought an infamous breach of the trust and confidence they all reposed in me   The pride of a family so illustrious in its descent  their fortunes unusually high for the country which  by the goodness of their hearts  they adorned  the relation they bore to the church  my foreign extraction and interest  the Lady s exalted merits  which made her of consequence to the hearts of several illustrious youths  before the Count of Belvedere made known
