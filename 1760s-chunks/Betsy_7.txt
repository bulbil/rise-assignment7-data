 The reception given her by Lady Mellasin  when brought home  and   presented to her by her husband  was conformable to what Mrs  Prinks had   made her expect  that lady omitting nothing to make her certain of being   always treated by her with the same affection as her own daughter       Sir Ralph Trusty  on being informed his young charge was come to town    came the next day to Mr  Goodman s to visit her  his lady accompanied   him  There had been a great intimacy and friendship between her and the   mother of Miss Betsy  and she could not hold in her arms the child of a   person so dear to her without letting fall some tears  which were looked   upon by the company as the tribute due to the memory of the dead  The   conjecture  in part  might be true  but the flow proceeded from the   mixture of another motive  not suspected  that of compassion for the   living  This lady was a woman of great prudence  piety  and virtue  she   had heard many things relating to the conduct of Lady Mellasin  which   made her think her a very unfit person to have the care of youth    especially those of her own sex  She had been extremely troubled when   Sir Ralph told her that Miss Betsy was sent for from the country to live   under such tuition  and would have fain opposed it  could she have done   so without danger of creating a misunderstanding between him and Mr    Goodman  well knowing the bigotted respect the latter had for his wife    and how unwilling he would be to do any thing that had the least   tendency to thwart her inclinations  She communicated her sentiments    however  on this occasion  to no person in the world  not even to her   own husband  but resolved  within herself  to take all the opportunities   that fell in her way  of giving Miss Betsy such instructions as she   thought necessary for her behaviour in general  and especially towards   the family in which it was her lot to be placed       Miss Betsy was now just entering into her fourteenth year  a nice and   delicate time in persons of her sex  since it is then they are most apt   to take the bent of impression  which  according as it is well or ill   directed  makes or mars the future prospect of their lives  She was   tall  well shaped  and perfectly amiable  without being what is called a   compleat beauty  and as she wanted nothing to render her liable to the   greatest temptations  so she stood in need of the surest arms for her   defence against them       But while this worthy lady was full of cares for the well doing of a   young creature who appeared so deserving of regard  Miss Betsy thought   she had the highest reason to be satisfied with her situation  and how    indeed  could it be otherwise  Lady Mellasin kept a great deal of   company  she received visits every morning  from ten to one o clock    from the most gay and polite of both sexes  all the news of the town was   talked on at her levee  and it seldom happened that some party of   pleasure was not formed for the ensuing evening  in all which Miss Betsy   and Miss Flora had their share       Never did the mistress of a private family indulge herself  and those   about her  with such a continual round of publick diversions  The court    the play  the ball  and opera  with giving and receiving visits    engrossed all the time that could be spared from the toilette  It   cannot  therefore  seem strange that Miss Betsy  to whom all these   things were entirely new  should have her head turned with the   promiscuous enjoyment  and the very power of reflection lost amidst the   giddy whirl  nor that it should be so long before she could recover it   enough to see the little true felicity of such a course of life       Among the many topicks with which this brilliant society entertained   each other  it may easily be supposed that love and gallantry were not   excluded  Lady Mellasin  though turned of forty  had her fine things   said to her  but both heaven and earth were ransacked for comparisons in   favour of the beauty of Miss Flora and Miss Betsy  but as there was   nothing particular in these kind of addresses  intended only to shew the   wit of those who made them  these young ladies answered them only with   raillery  in which art Miss Betsy soon learned to excel  She had the   glory  however  of being the first who excited a real passion in the   heart
