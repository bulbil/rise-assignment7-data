 with such cloying proofs of her regard  that not only the rest of the  company  but even Trunnion perceived her drift  and taking the alarm  accordingly  could not help exclaiming   Oho  I see how the land lies   and if I don t weather the point  I ll be d  d   Having thus expressed  himself to his afflicted inamorata  he made the best of his way to the  garrison  in which he shut himself up for the space of ten days  and had  no communication with his friends and domestics but by looks  which were  most significantly picturesque   CHAPTER VII    Divers Stratagems are invented and put in practice  in order to overcome  the obstinacy of Trunnion  who  at length  is teased and tortured into  the Noose of Wedlock     6 22 15  3 45 PM   This abrupt departure and unkind declaration affected Mrs  Grizzle so  much  that she fell sick of sorrow and mortification  and after having  confined herself to her bed for three days  sent for her brother  told  him she perceived her end drawing near  and desired that a lawyer might  be brought  in order to write her last will  Mr  Pickle  surprised at  her demand  began to act the part of a comforter  assuring her that her  distemper was not at all dangerous  and that he would instantly send  for a physician  who would convince her that she was in no manner  of jeopardy  so that there was no occasion at present to employ any  officious attorney in such a melancholy task  Indeed  this affectionate  brother was of opinion that a will was altogether superfluous at any  rate  as he himself was heir in law to his sister s whole real and  personal estate  But she insisted on his compliance with such determined  obstinacy  that he could no longer resist her importunities  and  a  arriving  she dictated and executed her will  in which she bequeathed  to Commodore Trunnion one thousand pounds  to purchase a mourning  ring  which she hoped he would wear as a pledge of her friendship and  affection  Her brother  though he did not much relish this testimony  of her love  nevertheless that same evening gave an account of this  particular to Mr  Hatchway  who was also  as Mr  Pickle assured him   generously remembered by the testatrix   The lieutenant  fraught with this piece of intelligence  watched for  an opportunity  and as soon as he perceived the commodore s features  a little unbended from that ferocious contraction they had retained so  long  ventured to inform him that Pickle s sister lay at the point of  death  and that she had left him a thousand pounds in her will  This  piece of news overwhelmed him with confusion  and Mr  Hatchway  imputing  his silence to remorse  resolved to take advantage of that favourable  moment  and counselled him to go and visit the poor young woman  who  was dying for love of him  But his admonition happened to be somewhat  unseasonable  Trunnion no sooner heard him mention the cause of her  disorder  than his morosity recurring  he burst out into a violent fit  of cursing  and forthwith betook himself again to his hammock  where he  lay  uttering  in a low growling tone of voice  a repetition of oaths  and imprecations  for the space of four and twenty hours  without  ceasing  This was a delicious meal to the lieutenant  who  eager to  enhance the pleasure of the entertainment  and at the same the conduce  to the success of the cause he had espoused  invented a stratagem  the  execution of which had all the effect he could desire  He prevailed on  Pipes  who was devoted to his service  to get on the top of the chimney   belonging to the commodore s chamber  at midnight  and lower down by  a rope a bunch of stinking whitings  which being performed  he put a  speaking trumpet to his mouth  and hallooed down the vent  in a voice  like thunder   Trunnion  Trunnion  turn out and be spliced  or he still  and be d      This dreadful note  the terror of which was increased by the silence and  darkness of the night  as well as the cello of the passage through which  it was conveyed  no sooner reached the ears of the astonished commodore   than turning his eyes towards the place from whence this solemn address  seemed to proceed  he beheld a glittering object that vanished in an  instant  Just as his superstitious fear had improved the apparition into  some supernatural messenger clothed in shining array  his opinion was  confirmed by a sudden explosion  which he took for thunder  though it  was no other than the noise of a pistol fired down the chimney by the  boatswain s mate  according to the instructions he had received  and he    6 22 15  3 45 PM   had time enough to descend before he was in
