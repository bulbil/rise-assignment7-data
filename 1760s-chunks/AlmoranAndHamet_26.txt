 power  that he came  therefore  the messenger of heaven  and that he   offered her unrivalled empire and everlasting love  To this she   answered only by an impatient and fond enquiry after HAMET   Think not   of HAMET   said ALMORAN   for why should he who is rejected of Heaven    be still the favorite of ALMEIDA    If thy hand   said ALMEIDA   could   quench in everlasting darkness  that vital spark of intellectual fire    which the word of the Almighty has kindled in my breast to burn for   ever  then might ALMEIDA cease to think of HAMET  but while that shall   live  whatever form it shall inhabit  or in whatever world it shall   reside  his image shall be for ever present  and to him shall my love be   for ever true   This glowing declaration of her love for HAMET  was   immediately succeeded by a tender anxiety for his safety  and a sudden   reflection upon the probability of his death  and the danger of his   situation if alive  threw her again into tears       ALMORAN  whom the ardour and impetuosity of her passions kept sometimes   silent  and sometimes threw into confusion  again attempted to sooth and   comfort her  she often urged him to tell her what was become of his   brother  and he as often evaded the question  As she was about to renew   her enquiry  and reflected that it had already been often made  and had   not yet been answered  she thought that ALMORAN had already put him to   death  this threw her into a new agony  of which he did not immediately   discover the cause  but as he soon learned it from her reproaches and   exclamations  he perceived that he could not hope to be heard  while she   was in doubt about the safety of HAMET  In order  therefore  to sooth   her mind  and prevent its being longer possessed with an image that   excluded every other  he assumed a look of concern and astonishment at   the imputation of a crime  which was at once so horrid and so   unnecessary  After a solemn deprecation of such enormous guilt  he   observed  that as it was now impossible for HAMET to succeed as his   rival  either in empire or in love  without the breach of a command    which he knew his virtue would implicitly obey  he had no motive either   to desire his death  or to restrain his liberty   His walk  says he   is   still uncircumscribed in Persia  and except this chamber  there is no   part of the palace to which he is not admitted        To this declaration ALMEIDA listened  as to the music of paradise  and   it suspended for a while every passion  but her love  the sudden ease of   her mind made her regardless of all about her  and she had in this   interval suffered ALMORAN to remove her veil  without reflecting upon   what he was doing  The moment she recollected herself  she made a gentle   effort to recover it  with some confusion  but without anger  The   pleasure that was expressed in her eyes  the blush that glowed upon her   cheek  and the contest about the veil  which to an amorous imagination   had an air of dalliance  concurred to heighten the passion of ALMORAN   almost to phrensy  she perceived her danger in his looks  and her   spirits instantly took the alarm  He seized her hand  and gazing   ardently upon her  he conjured her  with a tone and emphasis that   strongly expressed the tumultuous vehemence of his wishes  that she   would renounce the rites which had been forbidden above  and that she   would receive him to whom by miracle she had been alloted       ALMEIDA  whom the manner and voice of ALMORAN had terrified into   silence  answered him at first only with a look that expressed aversion   and disdain  overawed by fear   Wilt thou not   said ALMORAN   fulfill   the decrees of Heaven  I conjure thee   by Heaven  to answer   From   this solemn reference to Heaven  ALMEIDA derived new fortitude  she   instantly recollected  that she stood in the presence of Him  by whose   permission only every other power  whether visible or invisible  can   dispense evil or good   Urge no more   said she   as the decree of   Heaven  that which is inconsistent with Divine perfection  Can He in   whose hand my heart is  command me to wed the man whom he has not   enabled me to love  Can the Pure  the Just  the Merciful  have ordained   that I should suffer embraces which I loath  and violate vows which His
