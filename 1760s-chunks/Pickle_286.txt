himself  and his ears were regaled with  a thousand instances of the conjurer s wonderful prescience  for which  he was altogether indebted to fiction  Some of these specimens being  communicated to him by way of appeal to his opinion   They are    said he   mere phantoms of ignorance and credulity  swelled up in the  repetition  like those unsubstantial bubbles which the boys blow up in  soap suds with a tobacco pipe  And this will ever be the case in the  propagation of all extraordinary intelligence  The imagination naturally  magnifies every object that falls under its cognizance  especially  those that concern the passions of fear and admiration  and when the  occurrence comes to be rehearsed  the vanity of the relater exaggerates  every circumstance in order to enhance the importance of the  communication  Thus an incident  which is but barely uncommon  often  gains such accession in its progress through the fancies and mouths  of those who represent it  that the original fact cannot possibly be  distinguished  This observation might be proved and illustrated by  a thousand undeniable examples  out of which I shall only select one  instance  for the entertainment and edification of the company   A very  honest gentleman  remarkable for the gravity of his deportment  was one  day in a certain coffee house accosted by one of his particular friends   who  taking him by the hand  expressed uncommon satisfaction in seeing  him abroad  and in good health  after the dangerous and portentous  malady he had undergone  Surprised at this salutation  the gentleman  replied  it was true he had been a little out of order overnight  but  there was nothing at all extraordinary in his indisposition   Jesu  not  extraordinary   cried the other   when you vomited three black crows    This strange exclamation the grave gentleman at first mistook for  raillery  though his friend was no joker  but  perceiving in him all the  marks of sincerity and astonishment  he suddenly changed his opinion   and  after a short reverie  taking him aside  expressed himself in these  words   Sir  it is not unknown to you that I am at present engaged in a  treaty of marriage  which would have been settled long ago  had it  not been retarded by the repeated machinations of a certain person who  professed himself my rival  Now I am fully persuaded that this affair of  the three crows is a story of his invention  calculated to prejudice me  in the opinion of the lady  who  to be sure  would not choose to marry a  man who has a rookery in his bowels  and  therefore  I must insist upon  knowing the author of this scandalous report  that I may be able to  vindicate my character from the malicious aspersion   His friend  who  thought the demand was very reasonable  told him  without hesitation   that he was made acquainted with the circumstances of his distemper by    6 22 15  3 45 PM   Mr  Such a one  their common acquaintance  upon which the person who  conceived himself injured went immediately in quest of his supposed  defamer  and having found him   Pray  sir   said he  with a peremptory  tone   who told you that I vomited three black crows     Three    answered the gentleman   I mentioned two only     Zounds  Sir   cried  the other  incensed at his indifference   you will find the two too  many  if you refuse to discover the villainous source of such calumny    The gentleman  surprised at his heat  said he was sorry to find he had  been the accidental instrument of giving him offence  but translated  the blame  if any there was  from himself to a third person  to  whose information he owed his knowledge of the report  The plaintiff   according to the direction he received  repaired to the house of the  accused  and his indignation being inflamed at finding the story had  already circulated among his acquaintance  he told him  with evident  marks of displeasure  that he was come to pluck the same brace of crows  which he said he had disgorged  The defendant  seeing him very much  irritated  positively denied that he had mentioned a brace   One  indeed   said he   I own I took notice of  upon the authority of your  own physician  who gave me an account of it this morning     By the  Lord   cried the sufferer  in a rage  which he could no longer contain    that rascal has been suborned by my rival to slander my character in  this manner  but I ll be revenged  if there be either law or equity in  England   He had scarce pronounced these words  when the doctor happened  to enter the room  when his exasperated patient lifting up his cane    Sirrah   said he   if I live  I ll make that black crow the
