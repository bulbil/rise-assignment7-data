what she had   done       Early the next morning she sent to Blunt s  hired a handsome chaise and   pair  with a coachman and two servants  in a livery different from that   she gave her own man  then dressed herself in a riding habit and   hunting cap  which had been made for her on her going down to Oxford    and she had never been seen in by Mr  Trueworth  so that she thought she   might be pretty confident  that when he should come to examine who had   taken away his picture  the description could never enable him to guess   at the right person       With this equipage she went to the house where the painter lived  on   enquiring for him by name  he came immediately to know her   commands    You have the picture here of Mr  Trueworth   said she     pray  is it ready     Yes  Madam   answered he   I am just going to   carry it home     I am glad  then  Sir   resumed Miss Betsy   that I am   come time enough to save you that trouble  Mr  Trueworth went to   Hampstead last night  and being to follow him this morning  he desired I   would bring it with me  and pay you the money     O  Madam  as to the   money   said he   I shall see Mr  Trueworth again   and then called to   the man to bring down his picture    Indeed I shall not take it without   paying you   said she   but  in the hurry  I forgot to ask him the   sum  pray  how much is it     My constant price  Madam   replied he   is   ten guineas  and the gentleman never offered to beat me down        By this time the man had brought the picture down in a little box  which   the painter opening  as he presented it to her  cried   Is it not a   prodigious likeness  Madam     Yes  really  Sir   said she   in my   opinion there is no fault to be found    She then put the picture into   her pocket  counted ten guineas to him out of her purse  and told him    with a smile  that she believed he would very shortly have more business   from the same quarter  then bid the coachman drive on       The coachman having previous orders what to do  was no sooner out of   sight of the painter s house  then he turned down the first street  and   carried Miss Betsy home  she discharged her retinue  undressed herself   with all the speed she could  and whoever had now seen her  would never   have suspected she had been abroad       This young lady was not of a temper to grieve long for any thing  how   deep soever she was affected  the impression wore off on the first new   turn that offered itself  All her remorse  all her vexation  for the   base design laid against her at Mrs  Modely s  were dissipated the   moment she took it into her head to get possession of this picture  and   the success of her enterprize elated her beyond expression       It cannot be supposed  that it was altogether owing to the regard she   had for Mr  Trueworth  though in effect much more than she herself was   yet sensible of  that she took all these pains  it looks as if there was   also some little mixture of female malice in the case  Her brother had   said that the picture seemed to be intended to be worn at a lady s   watch  she doubted not but it was so  and the thoughts of disappointing   her rival s expectations contributed greatly to the satisfaction she   felt at what she had done                CHAPTER XIX       Presents the reader with some occurrences which  from the foregoing   preparations  might be expected  and also with others that may seem more   surprizing          Miss Betsy was not deceived in her conjecture in relation to the picture   being designed as an offering to some lady  Mr  Trueworth had not    indeed  sat for it to please himself  but to oblige Miss Harriot  who   had given some hints that such a present would not be unwelcome to her       It is a common thing with painters to keep the pieces in their own hands   as long as they can  after they are finished  especially if they are
