Faulkland  said he  you affect my Sister too much  we have been consulting for your safety  and came to talk with you upon it   I think there is no time to be lost  and that you ought immediately to retire into Holland   I am ready  said Mr Faulkland  but Mrs Arnold goes with me  I have her promise for it   Sidney shall follow you  answered my brother  making a motion to me to shew he would have me humour him in his ravings  I will not go without her  cried Mr Faulkland  the universe shall not now part us     I was almost distracted with apprehension  and knew not what reply to make  my brother looked confounded  and was silent   Mr Faulkland approached me  and with a look of gloomy despair  You are both mute  said he  Bidulph  I always thought you loved me  Mrs Arnold I hoped did not wish my death  but I am deceived in you both—I have no farther business with life—The friend I most confided in betrays me  the woman whom my soul worships  and to whom I sacrificed all my hopes of happiness  repays me with ingratitude  Why should such a wretch any longer submit to life  I have borne it too long already  but there’s my remedy  pointing furiously to his sword  which lay in the scabbard on a table   I could no longer contain myself  but bursting into tears  Oh  Sir  said I  accuse me not of ingratitude  I would to heaven my death could repair the heavy afflictions I have brought upon you  if it could  I would welcome it this hour  Your reproaches  cruel as they are  I forgive  I own myself the unhappy cause of all your misfortunes  we have been mutually fatal to each other  You know I always valued and esteemed you  and have in your calamity already been sufficiently punished for the share I have had in bringing it on you  What shall I say to you  Sir  My whole fortune I think too small  too poor a recompence  to the man who has obliged me beyond a possibility of return  Yet what have I to offer more  Can you  Sir  can you urge me to a marriage at so strange a juncture  Think how it will expose us both to censure  Your long attachment to me has not been a secret  Think what dreadful constructions may be put on your conduct  nay  on mine  should a union now take place  brought about  as it must appear  by so terrible an event   Mr Faulkland was silent  his eyes fixed on the ground  My brother took up the argument  Indeed  my dear Faulkland  my sister has reason for her fears  You know I ever was your sincere friend  you know too I always was of opinion that Sidney ought to have been your wife  her former objections I thought were romantic scruples  and hardly forgave her refusing you  The present obstacle has more weight in it—Do not mistake me  added he hastily  seeing Mr Faulkland raise his eyes full of resentment at him  I wish my sister still to be yours  and will consent to your marriage with my whole heart  but let me conjure you to take a more favourable juncture  withdraw yourself but for the present  your affairs may not be so desperate as you imagine  If that villain Smyth should chance to recover  perhaps his conscience may awaken remorse  and he may be prevailed on to do    you justice  In that case you must be cleared from the most distant imputation of what my sister hinted at  and what has but too justly alarmed her  Cleared as your character will then be  and conscious as we both are of the innocence of your intentions there will remain no bar to Mrs Arnold’s giving you her hand   Smyth cannot recover  interrupted Mr Faulkland  suddenly—there is no hope can spring from that  Then answered my brother  at worst you can but live abroad  all parts of the world are alike to such a philosopher as my sister is  and probably  circumstanced as your marriage will appear  she may like best to reside out of England — Mr Faulkland shook his head  and with a smile of indignation  Leave me  Bidulph  cried he  I cannot bear your attempting to deceive me  You think me mad  and are cruel enough to endeavour at imposing on me—I know my mind is disturbed—but who has driven me to despair  to madness  to death  and he cast a look at me that chilled my blood   Be satisfied  Madam  you shall soon be rid of this fatal—hated—betrayed—abandoned wretch  he spoke this with his hands grasped eagerly together  and his eyes lifted up to heaven  Then striking his breast  he burst into tears  and rushing suddenly into his closet  he shut the door violently  locking it on the inside   He wept aloud  and his agonies reduced me almost to the same condition with himself   I begged my brother would endeavour to prevail on him to open the door  for I was fearful of his making some dreadful attempt upon his
