  last visit  and  though she could not avoid confessing in her heart that   she had treated him neither as a gentleman nor a friend  yet her vanity   having suggested  that he was capable of resenting any thing she did    received a prodigious shock by the disappointment it now sustained                CHAPTER XVII       Contains only such things as the reader might reasonably expect to have   been informed of before          It was the fate of Miss Betsy to attract a great number of admirers  but   never to keep alive  for any length of time  the flame she had inspired   them with  Whether this was owing to the inconstancy of the addressers    or the ill conduct of the person addressed  cannot absolutely be   determined  but it is highly probable that both these motives might   sometimes concur to the losing her so many conquests  Mr  Trueworth had   been the most assiduous  and also the most persevering  of all that had   ever yet wore her chains  His love had compelled his judgment to pay an   implicit obedience to her will  he had submitted to humour all the   little extravagances of her temper  and affected to appear easy at what   his reason could not but disapprove  He had flattered himself  that all   that was blame worthy in her would wear off by degrees  and that every   error would be her last  till a long succession of repeated   inadvertences made him first begin to fear  and then to be convinced    that however innocent she might be in fact  her manner of behaviour   would ill suit with the character he wished should always be maintained   by the woman he had made choice of for a wife       His meeting her at Miss Forward s  her obstinately persisting in going   to the play with that abandoned creature  after the remonstrances he had   made her on that score  her returning home so late  and in disorder    conducted by a stranger  in fine  what he saw himself  and had been   told  concerning the proceedings of that night  gave the finishing   stroke to all his hopes  that she would ever  at least  while youth and   beauty lasted  be brought to a just sensibility of the manner in which   she ought to act       If the letter  contrived and sent by the mischievous Miss Flora  had   reached his hand but two days sooner  it would have had no other effect   upon him than to make him spurn the invective scroll beneath his feet    and wish to serve the author in the same manner  but poor Miss Betsy   had  by her own mismanagement  prepared his heart to receive any   impressions to her prejudice  yet was the scandal it contained of so   gross a kind  that he could not presently give into the belief of it     Good God   he cried   it is impossible  If she has so little sense of   honour or reputation  as the lightness of her behaviour makes some   people too ready to imagine  her very pride is sufficient to secure her   virtue  she would not  could not  condescend to the embraces of a man   who thought so meanly of her as to attempt the gaining her on any other   score than that of marriage  And yet   pursued he  after a pause   who   knows but that very pride  which seems to be her defence  may have   contributed to her fall  She has vanity enough to imagine she may act   with impunity what she would condemn in others  She might fancy  as the   poet says             That faultless form could act no crime        But Heav n  on looking on it  must forgive         Why then   continued he   should the foolish remains of the tenderness   I once had for her  make me still hesitate to believe her guilty  No    no  the account before me has too much the face of truth  it is too   circumstantial to be the work of mere invention  No one would forge a   lie  and at the same time present the means of detecting it to be so    Here is the village specified  the nurse s name  and a particular   direction how I may convince myself of the shameful truth  There is no   room to doubt        To strengthen the opinion he now had of her guilt  the words Miss Flora   had said to him  returned to his remembrance  that there was a time when   Miss Betsy had trusted her with her dearest
