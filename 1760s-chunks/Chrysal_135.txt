         Ah   but that was not the case of his grace of   who lies     this moment in the agonies of death   his physicians left him two   hours ago  The Lord prepare us all  and give us notice of His   coming I He did not stint himself of wine   he took his bottle     heerfully  good man        Cheerfully  did you say  I should have said sottishly   for   he has done nothing but drink for these many years past  He has   run into the opposite extreme from the doctorâ€” drinking too much    and not eating enough to support nature  And I hope you do not   say he is gone without warning at fourscore   He has had time   enough to prepare   but why should these examples affect you   particularly   You do not eat like the doctor  nor drink like his   grace  and are young enough to be son to the youngest of them          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA US     Why  then  should you fear their fate   Here  John  give me a   pint glass half full of Madeira  and reach me three or four of those   jeUies  Now  my dear  if you are afraid to eat or drink  sup thia   with a bit of bread  and I will answer for its agreeing with you        My late mistress sat all this time at her supper  without being   able to join in the conversation   but as soon as his lordship s taking   the jelUes made a pause ia his lady s tenderness  she called for a   glass of wiae  and  bowing to the bishop  drank to him by the title   of hia grace  very gravely  t      His lordship started  and his lady stared  while she finished her   glass without any emotion  and seemed quite unconscious of having   said anything unusual or improper  This behaviour still embarrassed   them more  when the lady  unable to contain her surprise â€”     Dear madam    said she    what have you said 7 or how came you   to address my lord by that title           I hope  madam    replied the other    I have not said anything   improper  You really frighten me  I hope I have not been failing   in my respect  or addressed his lordship by any improper title           I cannot say an improper one  indeed   but one that does not   belong to him  at least as yet    returned the lady        Dear madam  what do you mean   Pray do not distress me    But you must divert yourself  surely  It is not possible that I   could fail in any respect to his grace         Hal ha  ha  There it is again  Fail in your respect   No  You   only raised your respect too high  You called him his grace  that s all         And is that all 7 Thank Heaven that I did  And long live hia   grace  I say again    said she  dropping on her knees and eagerly   kissing his hand    Long live your grace  There is  there must be    truth in dreams  and infidels alone can doubt it        At the mention of dreams  the bishop  who had hitherto continued   to sip up his jelly without seeming to take any notice of what they   were saying  could not forbear showing some emotion   for he had   the strongest faith in them  and always sanguinely defended their   credit  especially since his present elevation had confirmed those   of his grandmother        What dreams  pray  good madam   7 said he  addressing my late   mistress with a visible anxiety    What dreams do you mean 7   Those which were thought to have respect to me are understood   to be already accomplished          Please  your grace  the impulse of the spirit is upon me  and I   cannot call you by any other title  Please  your grace  I say I   dreamed last night  as I told your lady but just now  that I met her   at court on some very great occasion  as fine as hands could make   her  I told her this just now  before I knew one syllable of his grace s   death   and that she came up to me smiling  and thanked
