it  if it give you pain  Yet is the question so important to me  so much is my heart concerned in the favourable answer I hope for from your goodness  that I must not let this opportunity slip  except it be your pleasure that I attend your determination from Mrs  Selby s mouth —Yet that I choose not  neither  because I presume for more favour from your own  than you will  on cold deliberation  allow your aunt to shew me  Love will plead for its faithful votary in a single breast  when consultation on the supposed fit and unfit  the object absent  will produce delay  But I will retire  for two moments  You shall be my prisoner mean time  Not a soul shall come in to interrupt us  unless it be at your call  I will return  and receive your determination  and if that be the fixing of my happy day  how will you rejoice me   While I was debating within myself  whether I should be angry or pleased  he returned  and found me walking about the room —Soul of my hope  said he  taking with reverence my hand  I now presume that you can  that you will  oblige me     147 You have given me no time  Sir  But let me request  that you will not expect an answer  in relation to the early day you so early ask for  till after the receipt of your next Letters from Italy  You see how the admirable Lady is urged  how reluctantly she has given them but distant hopes of complying with their wishes  I should be glad to wait for the next Letters  for those  at least  which will be an answer to yours  acquainting them  that there is a woman with whom you think you could be happy  I am earnest in this request  Sir  Think it not owing to affectation   I acquiesce  madam  The answer to those Letters will soon be here  It will indeed be some time before I can receive a reply to that I wrote in answer to Jeronymo s last Letter  I impute not affectation to my dearest Miss Byron  I can easily comprehend your motive  It is a generous one  But it besits me to say  that the next Letters from Italy  whatever may be their contents  can now make no alteration on my part  Have I not declared myself to your friends  to you  and to the world   Indeed  Sir  they may make an alteration on mine  highly as I think of the honour Sir Charles Grandison does me by his good opinion  For  pardon me  should the most excellent of women think of resuming a place in your heart—  Let me interrupt you  madam —It cannot be  that Lady Clementina  proceeding  as she has done  on motives of piety  zealous in her religion  and all her relations now earnest in another man s favour  can alter her mind  I should not have acted with justice  with gratitude  to her  had I not tried her stedfastness by every way I could devise  Nor  in justice to both Ladies  would I allow myself to apply for your favour till I had her resolution confirmed to me under her own hand after my arrival in England  But were it now possible that she should vary  and were you  madam    148 to hold your determination in my favour suspended  the consequence would be this  I should never  while that suspence lasted  be the husband of any woman on earth   I hope  Sir  you will not be displeased  I did not think you would so soon be so very earnest  But this  Sir  I say  Let me have reason to think  that my happiness will not be the misfortune of a more excellent woman  and it shall be my endeavour to make the man happy who only can make me so   He clasped me in his arms with an ardor—that displeased me not—on reflexion—But at the time startled me  He then thanked me again on one knee  I held out the hand he held not in his  with intent to raise him  for I could not speak  He received it as a token of favour  kissed it with ardor  arose  again pressed my cheek with his lips  I was too much surprised to repulse him with anger  But was he not too free  Am I a prude  my dear  In the odious sense of the abused word  I am sure  I am not  But in the best sense  as derived from prudence  and used in opposition to a word that denotes a worse character  I own myself one of those who would wish to restore it to its natural respectable signification  for the sake of virtue  which  as Sir Charles himself once hinted  a   is in danger of suffering by the abuse of it  as Religion once did  by that of the word Puritan   Sir Charles  on my making towards the door that led to the stairs  withdrew with such a grace  as shewed he was capable of recollection   Again I ask  was he not too free
