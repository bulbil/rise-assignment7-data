gave me an appointment one morning in a place sadly impervious to all seasonable interruption  Yet as he was a little go by the  ground  scarcely up to my shoulders  and apparently of feeble frame  he did not look like a very dangerous antagonist  so away I went with some little courage to the appointed spot  Thinking to come off with flying colours  I anticipated the effect of my bravery on the heart of Portia  but as it turned out  I was gathering my laurels before they had budded  The little secretary  who had been practising for two or three years at the fencing school  disarmed me like a very baby  and holding the point of his sword up to my throat  Prepare thyself  said he  to balance thine accounts with this world  and open a correspondence with the next  or give me thy rascally word to leave the Marchioness of Chaves this very day  and never more to think of my Portia  I gave him my rascally word  and was honest enough not to think of breaking it  There was an awkwardness in shewing my face before the servants of the family  after having been worsted  and especially before the high and mighty princess who had been the theme of our tournament  I only returned home to get together my baggage and wages  and on that very day set off towards Toledo  with a purse pretty well lined  and a knapsack at my back with my wardrobe and moveables  Though my rascally word was not given to abandon the purlieus of Madrid  I considered it as a matter of delicacy to disappear  at least for a few seasons  My resolution was to make the tour of Spain  and to halt first at one town and then at another  My ready money  thought I  will carry me a good way  I shall not call about me very prodigally  When my stock is exhausted  I can but go into service again  A lad of my versatility will find places in plenty  whenever it may be convenient to look out for them   It was particularly my wish to see Toledo  and I got thither after three days  journey  My quarters were at a respectable house of entertainment  where I was taken for a gentleman of some figure  under favour of my best clothes  in which I did not fail to bedizen myself  With the pick tooth carelessness of a lounger  the affectation of a puppy  and the pertness of a wit  it remained with me to dictate the terms of an arrangement with some very pretty women who infested that neighbourhood  but  as a hint had been given me that the pocket was the high road to their good graces  my amorous enthusiasm was a little flattered  and  as it was no part of my plan to domesticate myself in any one place  after having seen all the lions at Toledo  I started one morning with the dawn  and took the road to Cuen√ßa  intending to go to Arragon  On the second day I went into an inn which std open to receive me by the road side  Just as I was beginning to recruit the carnal department of my nature  in came a party belonging to the Holy Brotherhood  These gentlemen called for wine  and set in for a drinking bout  Over their cups they were conning the description of a young man  whom they had orders to arrest  The spark  said one of them  is not above three and twenty  be has long black hair  is well grown  with an aquiline nose  and rides a bay horse   I heard their talk without seeming to be a listener  and  in fact  did not trouble my head much about it  They remained in their quarters  and I pursued my journey  Scarcely had I gone a quarter of a mile  before I met a young gentleman on horseback  as personable as need be  and mounted as described by the officers  Faith and truth  thought I within myself  this is the very identical man  Black hair and an aquiline nose  One cannot help doing a good office when it comes in one s way  Sir  said I  give me leave to ask you whether you have not some disagreeable business on your hands  The young man  without returning any answer  looked at me from head to foot  and seemed startled at my question  I assured him it was not wanton curiosity that induced me to address him  He was satisfied of that when I related all I had heard at the inn  My unknown benefactor  said he  I will not deny to you that I have reason to believe myself actually the person of whom the officers are in quest  therefore I shall take another road to avoid them  In my opinion  answered I  it would be better to look out for a spot where you may be in safety  and under shelter from a storm which is brewing  and will soon pour down upon our heads  Without loss of time we discovered and made for a row of trees  forming a natural avenue  which led us to the foot of a mountain  where we found an hermitage   There was a large and deep grotto which time
