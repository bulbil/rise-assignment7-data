of all the pains I took to be otherwise  I was hurt at the idea it would probably be the last at which I should be  I felt a kind of concern at parting  not only with the few I loved  but with those who had till to night been indifferent to me       There is something affecting in the idea of the last time of seeing even those persons or places  for which we have no particular affection       I go to morrow to take leave of the nuns  at the Ursuline convent  I suppose I shall carry this melancholy idea with me there  and be hurt at seeing them too for the last time        I pay visits every day amongst the peasants  who are very fond of me  I talk to them of their farms  give money to their children  and teach their wives to be good huswives  I am the idol of the country people five miles round  who declare me the most amiable  most generous woman in the world  and think it a thousand pities I should be damned        Adieu  say every thing for me to my sweet friends  if arrived   7th  Eleven o clock       I have this moment a large packet of letters for Emily from Mrs  Melmoth  which I intend to take the care of myself  as I hope to be in England almost as soon as this       Good morrow   Yours ever   c   A  FITZGERALD   Three o clock       I am just come from visiting the nuns  they expressed great concern at my leaving Canada  and promised me their prayers on my voyage  for which proof of affection  though a good protestant  I thanked them very sincerely       I wished exceedingly to have brought some of them away with me  my nun  as they call the amiable girl I saw take the veil  paid me the flattering tribute of a tear at parting  her fine eyes had a concern in them  which affected me extremely       I was not less pleased with the affection the late superior  my good old countrywoman  expressed for me  and her regret at seeing me for the last time       Surely there is no pleasure on earth equal to that of being beloved  I did not think I had been such a favorite in Canada  it is almost a pity to leave it  perhaps nobody may love me in England       Yes  I believe Fitzgerald will  and I have a pretty party enough of friends in your family       Adieu  I shall write a line the day we embark  by another ship  which may possibly arrive before us     LETTER CLXXI   171   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   Silleri  Aug  11   WE embark to morrow  and hope to see you in less than a month  if this fine wind continues       I am just come from Montmorenci  where I have been paying my devotions to the tutelary deities of the place for the last time        I had only Fitzgerald with me  we visited every grotto on the lovely banks  where we dined  kissed every flower  raised a votive altar on the little island  poured a libation of wine to the river goddess  and  in short  did every thing which it became good heathens to do       We stayed till day light began to decline  which  with the idea of the last time  threw round us a certain melancholy solemnity  a solemnity which    Deepen d the murmur of the falling floods   And breath d a browner horror on the woods           I have twenty things to do  and but a moment to do them in  Adieu       I am called down  it is to Madame Des Roches  she is very obliging to come thus far to see me   12th       We go on board at one  Madame Des Roches goes down with us as far as her estate  where her boat is to fetch her on shore  She has made me a present of a pair of extreme pretty bracelets  has sent your brother an elegant sword knot  and Emily a very beautiful cross of diamonds       I don t believe she would be sorry if we were to run away with her to England  I protest I am half inclined  it is pity such a woman should be hid all her life in the woods of Canada  besides  one might convert her you know  and  on a religious principle  a little deviation from rules is allowable       Your brother is an admirable missionary amongst unbelieving ladies  I really think I shall carry her off  if it is only for the good of her soul       I have but one objection  if Fitzgerald should take a fancy to prefer the tender to the lively  I should be in some danger  there is something very seducing in her eyes  I assure you     LETTER CLXXII   172   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   Kamaraskas  Aug
