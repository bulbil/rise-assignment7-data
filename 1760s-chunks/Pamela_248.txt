answer them all at once  Pretty creature  is not that it       I was so vexed  I bit a piece of my fan out  not knowing what I did  but   still I said nothing  and did nothing but flutter it  and fan myself       I believe  said she  my next question will make up half a dozen  and   then  modest one  I shall be entitled to an answer       He rose and brought the bottle and glass  Come  said he  Mrs  Bride  be   pleased to help my lady  and I will be your deputy  Sir  replied I  it   is in a good hand  help my lady yourself   Why  creature  said she  dost   thou think thyself above it   And then flew into a passion   Insolence    continued she  this moment  when I bid you  know your duty  and give me   a glass of wine  or        So I took a little spirit then  Thought I  I can but be beat   If  said   I  to attend your ladyship at table  or even kneel at your feet  was   required of me  I would most gladly do it  were I only the person you   think me  but  if it be to triumph over one who has received honours    that she thinks require her to act another part  not to be utterly   unworthy of them  I must say  I cannot do it       She seemed quite surprised  and looked now upon her kinsman  and then   upon her woman  I m astonished  quite astonished   Well  then  I suppose   you would have me conclude you my brother s wife  could you not       Your ladyship  said I  compels me to say this   Well  returned she  but   dost thou thyself think thou art so   Silence  said her kinsman  gives   consent   Tis plain enough she does  Shall I rise  madam  and pay my   duty to my new aunt       Tell me  said my lady  what  in the name of impudence  possesses thee   to dare to look upon thyself as my sister   Madam  replied I  that is a   question will better become your most worthy brother to answer  than me       She was rising in great wrath  but her woman said  Good your ladyship    you ll do yourself more harm than her  and if the poor girl has been   deluded so  as you have heard  with the sham marriage  she ll be more   deserving of your ladyship s pity than anger  True  Beck  very true    said my lady  but there s no bearing the impudence of the creature in   the mean time       I would have gone out at the door  but her kinsman ran and set his back   against it  I expected bad treatment from her pride  and violent temper    but this was worse than I could have thought of  And I said to him  Sir    when my master comes to know your rude behaviour  you will  may be  have   cause to repent it  and went and sat down in the window again       Another challenge  by gad  said he  but I am glad she says her   master   You see  madam  she herself does not believe she is married    and so has not been so much deluded as you think for  And  coming to   me with a most barbarous air of insult  he said  kneeling on one knee   before me  My new aunt  your blessing or your curse  I care not which    but quickly give me one or other  that I may not lose my dinner       I gave him a most contemptuous look  Tinselled toy  said I   for he was   laced all over   twenty or thirty years hence  when you are at age  I   shall know how to answer you better  mean time  sport with your footman    and not with me  and so I removed to another window nearer the door  and   he looked like a sad fool  as he is       Beck  Beck  said my lady  this is not to be borne  Was ever the like   heard  Is my kinsman and Lord Davers s to be thus used by such a slut    And was coming to me  And indeed I began to be afraid  for I have but   a poor heart  after all  But Mrs  Jewkes hearing high words  came in   again
