His airs were mostly melancholy  but he would now and then entertain the lady with a favourite love song  After this they talked together till supper  and the prince seemed more and more delighted with her conversation  When she retired to her room at night  she could hardly sleep for reflecting on the extraordinary scene of the former day  but how much was she surprized next morning  when  on coming down to breakfast  she found the knight her father sitting with the prince of ← Dorando →    His highness accosted her with true Spanish gallantry    Donna Eleanora  it would seem that heaven has destined you for my happiness  I sent an express at midnight for your father  whom I rejoice to see  Page  24  under this roof  If your affections are not engaged  I hope you will accept the hand of the prince of ← Dorando →       Donna Eleanora was struck with wonder  The vision came full in her mind  and she adored the benignity of Providence  Then turning to the prince    My affections  said she  are no otherways engaged than to this illustrious house  They have long been so engaged  and they are now a thousand times more so since I have seen the representative of the family —Your highness does me an honour which I cannot find words to express —It shall be the study of my life to deserve it    —His highnesses priest was called in to his presence  and the ceremony was immediately performed  Now madam  said the prince  I can show you my gallery  Page  25  without being afraid of any reproof from you     The news of this marriage flew over the country  and filled every honest heart with joy  but it was like a clap of thunder to the house of Arvidoso  They feared that their hopes were blasted  The adherents could not conceal their vexation  but went about cursing the day that Stocaccio died  and imprecating vengeance on Donna Eleanora   The prince ← Dorando → now resumed in a great measure his former chearfulness  All the nobility around came and paid their court to him  and he found himself as fit for society as ever  He went to Sevile with his princess  and resided a part of the winter  His levee was continually crouded  A celebrated tragedy  in honour of his family  was performed in the  Page  26  public theatre  where the prince himself appeared amidst the acclamations of the audience   Something was still wanting to render the felicity compleat  The princess ← Dorando → could have wished to have brought the prince a son of his own to take up his succession  but in the mean time she was anxious to undeceive him with regard to his nephew  and when she despaired of her own offspring  she became still more anxious  She took every opportunity of talking to the prince concerning his sister  and she convinced him of the falsity of many of the stories that had been told him   It was now ten years since his nephew s birth  but Donna Justina was still alive in obscure apartments at Sevile  The prince was prevailed with to visit her  and was alone with  Page  27  her for a considerable time  when he examined her as to the whole affair  with that keen penetration for which he was distinguished  The accounts which he heard from Donna Justina  were so direct  and enforced with such serious and solemn asseverations  while his strict attention made it impossible for her to dissemble  that the prince was much persuaded of his sister s innocence  and of the honour of his nephew   He owned this to the princess his consort  who insisted that he was called upon to show his conviction to the world  and to do justice to his injured heir  And when the prince seemed still to hesitate  her eagerness for the young Don Ferdinand would sometimes throw her into transports of passion  which her enemies represented as gross affectation  but which  Page  28  the prince saw to be real  He therefore committed to the flames his settlements on the house of Arvidoso  and devised his succession to his nephew Don Ferdinand   He was often asked by the princess to see his nephew  but he would not agree to it  crying    Ah madam  These wretches—These wretches—They have planted thorns in my mind  which have taken root for so many years  that I cannot entirely pull them out  without tearing myself to pieces  Let me alone  I cannot bear to think of the subject  It opens afresh the wounds of my heart—I have been imposed upon—I have been unjust—I have been cruel—But God knows  my intentions were upright—I have made reparation  and my soul shall rest in peace      Page  29  Soon after this  the prince Carlos ← Dorando → died  and was carried in great funeral pomp to the tomb of his ancestors   The family of Arvidoso would not yet give over their designs upon the wealth of ← Dorando →   Its prince was then in minority  and he had several guardians of high rank and character  but so extravagantly keen to aggrandize their pupil  that they grasped at a tempting appearance  without perceiving that it
