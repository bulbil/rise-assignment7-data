you will make the least   use of your penetration  and examine with a desire of being convinced    you will easily distinguish the real passion from the counterfeit  that   love  whose supremest pleasure is in being capable to give felicity to   the beloved object  and that wild desire  which aims at no more than a   self gratification   the one has the authority of heaven for its   sanction   the other no excuse but nature in its depravity  From all   attempts of the one  I am confident  your virtue and good sense will   always defend you  but to fly with too great obstinacy the other  is not   to answer the end of your creation  and deny yourself a blessing  which   you seem formed to enjoy in the most extensive degree       Both the voice and manner in which monsieur du Plessis spoke  gave   Louisa some suspicion of what he aimed at in this definition  and filled   her at the same time with emotions of various kinds  but dissembling   them as well as she could  and endeavouring to turn what he said into   raillery  you argue very learnedly on this subject  it must be   confessed  answered she smiling  but all you can urge on that head  nor   the compliment you make me  can win me to believe that love of any kind   is not attended with more mischief than good   where it is accompanied   with the strictest honour  constancy  purity  and all the requisites   that constitute what is called a perfect passion  there are ordinarily   so many difficulties in the way to the completion of its wishes  that   the breast which harbours it must endure a continual agitation  which   surely none would chuse to be involved in       Ah  madam  how little are you capable of judging of this passion  said   he  there is a delicacy in love which renders even its pains pleasing    and how much soever a lover suffers  the thoughts of for whom he suffers   is more than a compensation  I am myself an instance of this truth   I   am a lover   conscious unworthiness of a suitable return of affection    and a thousand other impediments lie between me and hope  yet would I   not change this dear anxiety for that insipid case I lived in before I   saw the only object capable of making me a convert to love   It is   certain my passion is yet young  but a few days has given it root which   no time  no absence  no misfortune ever can dislodge   The charming maid   is ignorant of her conquest   the carnival draws near to a   conclusion   I must return to the army  and these cruel circumstances   oblige me either to make a declaration which she may possibly condemn as   too abrupt  or go and leave her unknowing of my heart  and thereby   deprive myself even of her pity   Which party  madam  shall I   take   Will the severe extreme  to which I am driven  be sufficient to   attone for a presumption which else would merit her disdain       Louisa must have been as dull as she was really the contrary  not to   have known all this was meant to herself  and the pleasing confusion   which this discovery infused thro  all her veins  made her at the same   time sensible of the difference she put between him and all those who   before had entertained her on that subject  but not knowing presently   whether she ought to attribute it to her good or ill fortune  she was   wholly at a loss how to behave  and  to avoid giving any direct answer    still affected an air of pleasantry       See  cried she  the little reason you  have to speak in the praise of   love  for if pity be all you have to hope for from your  mistress  I am   afraid the consolation will be no way adequate to the misfortune       Yet if you vouchsafe me that  replied he  kissing her hard  I never   shall complain  Me  interrupted she  pretending the utmost astonishment    and drawing her chair somewhat farther from him  Yes  beautiful Louisa    resumed he  it is you alone who have been capable of teaching me what   love truly is   your eyes  at first sight  subdued my heart  but your   virtue has since made a conquest of my soul   if I dare hope to make you   mine  it is only by such ways as heaven  and those who have the power of   disposing you  shall approve   in the mean time I implore no more than   your permission to admire you  and to convince you  by
