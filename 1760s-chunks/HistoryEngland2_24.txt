from the theatre   But  though the court was thus lost to decency  the passion for uniformity in religion in the nation seemed to revive  The parliament was equally set against the Presbyterians and the Papists  an act was made called the Test act  importing that every person in office and employment should take the oaths of aliegiance and supremacy  receive the sacrament in some parish church before competent witnesses  and subscribe a declaration  renouncing the doctrine of transubstantiation  This was levelled against the Duke of York  the King s brother  who had professed himself a Papist  and whom the parliament secretly aimed at excluding from the throne  The fears and discontents of the nation were vented without restraint  the apprehensions of a Popish successor  an abandoned court  a parliament that had continued  without a new election  for seventeen years  an alliance cemented with France  the secret enemy of England and the Protestant religion  and an unsuccessful and expensive war with Holland  their natural allies  all gave cause to kindle a spirit of indignation among the people  The court tried every method  but in vain  to satisfy these murmurs  or appease them  Even the coffee houses were suppressed where such topics were generally debated     63 This universal ferment  as may easily be imagined  broke out into an alarm  When the spirit of the English is once excited  they either find objects of resentment  or they make them  A rumour of a Popish conspiracy was first propagated  and one Titus Oates soon appeared to give it confirmation  Titus Oates had been from his youth an indigent and infamous adventurer  He was abandoned  illiterate  and shameless  He had been once indicted for perjury  afterwards chaplain of a man of war  and dismissed for unnatural practices  He then professed himself a Roman Catholic  went to the Jesuits College at St  Omer  but was dismissed  after some residence there  with infamy  He then returned to London  filled with projects of revenge  and the animosities of this unhappy nation soon appeared a proper place of nourishment to give this viper s virulence effect  He deposed upon oath  that the Jesuits  several of whom he named  and who were soon after taken up  had tried the King under the name of the Black Bastard  condemned him as an heretic  and resolved to deprive him of life  that several attempts had been made without success  and that not only the King s brother  but even the Queen were privy to the design  The house of commons immediately took fire at this pretended conspiracy  they petitioned for removing the Queen  rewarded Oates with a pension of twelve hundred pounds  and immediately ordered the conspirators to be tried in the courts of justice  Several Jesuits were tried  their very profession was at that time sufficient to destroy them  before a partial Judge and an exasperated Jury  no mercy could be expected  and several  though apparently innocent  were executed as traytors upon this miscreant s information  Coleman  the Duke of York s secretary  Ireland  Pickering  Grove  Fenwick  and White bread were among the first that fell  they died declaring   64 their innocence to the last moment of their lives   While the Protestants were labouring to humble both the Puritans and the Papists  those two parties were at the same time mutually employed in ruining each other  Plot was set against plot  that contrived by Oates was called the Jesuits  that set to oppose it was called by the name of the Mealtub Plot  as the scheme of the conspiracy was found hidden in a meal tub  This was a design against Oates  for his perjuries had drawn upon him the furious resentment of the Catholic party  they were determined to take away his life by the same false evidence by which he had taken the lives of so many others   Of all these plots tending to disturb the peace of the kingdom  it is said the Earl of Shaftesbury was at the bottom  he had been a member of the Long Parliament in the civil wars  and had gained great influence among the Presbyterians  he had insinuated himself into the confidence of Cromwell  and afterwards employed his credit in forwarding the restoration  He had been made one of the privycouncil in the present reign  but was ejected thence for the duplicity of his conduct  He was possessed of uncommon abilities  joined with turbulence  dissimulation  and unbounded ambition  It was thought that this nobleman  in revenge for his disgrace at court  headed the demagogue faction  and alarmed the King with unceasing dangers   He artfully increased the people s apprehensions of a Popish successor  and  by his interest  brought a bill into the house of commons for the exclusion of James Duke of York from the succession  In the national animosity raised against Papists it was no difficult matter to have it passed through the house of commons  but  being presented to the house of peers  it was thrown out by a great majoriy     65 The commons were greatly incensed at this repulse  but particularly their anger fell upon the Earl of Halifax  who exerted himself in the opposition  Halifax disregarded their anger  secure in conscious innocence  But their rage fell with more
