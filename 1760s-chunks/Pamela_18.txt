honour has offered me  and I promise   you  that I will never let your name pass my lips  but with reverence   and gratitude  and so God Almighty bless your honour  for ever and ever    Amen       Then rising from my knees  I went away with another guise sort of   heart than I came into his presence with  and so I fell to writing this   letter  And thus all is happily over       And now  my dearest father and mother  expect to see soon your poor   daughter  with an humble and dutiful mind  returned to you  and don t   fear but I know how to be as happy with you as ever  for I will be in   the loft  as I used to do  and pray let my little bed be got ready  and   I have a small matter of money  which will buy me a suit of clothes    fitter for my condition than what I have  and I will get Mrs  Mumford   to help me to some needle work  and fear not that I shall be a burden   to you  if my health continues  I know I shall be blessed  if not for   my own sake  for both your sakes  who have  in all your trials and   misfortunes  preserved so much integrity as makes every body speak   well of you both  But I hope he will let good Mrs  Jervis give me a   character  for fear it should be thought that I was turned away for   dishonesty       And so  my dear parents  may you be blest for me  and I for you  And I   will always pray for my master and Mrs  Jervis  So good night  for it is   late  and I shall be soon called to bed       I hope Mrs  Jervis is not angry with me  She has not called me to   supper  though I could eat nothing if she had  But I make no doubt I   shall sleep purely to night  and dream that I am with you  in my dear    dear  happy loft once more       So good night again  my dear father and mother  says                                                Your poor honest DAUGHTER       Perhaps I mayn t come this week  because I must get up the linen  and   leave in order every thing belonging to my place  So send me a line  if   you can  to let me know if I shall be welcome  by John  who will call   for it as he returns  But say nothing of my coming away to him  as yet    for it will be said I blab every thing                LETTER XVII         MY DEAREST DAUGHTER       Welcome  welcome  ten times welcome shall you be to us  for you come   to us innocent  and happy  and honest  and you are the staff of our old   age  and our comfort  And though we cannot do for you as we would  yet    fear not  we shall live happily together  and what with my diligent   labour  and your poor mother s spinning  and your needle work  I make no   doubt we shall do better and better  Only your poor mother s eyes begin   to fail her  though  I bless God  I am as strong and able  and willing   to labour as ever  and  O my dear child  your virtue has made me  I   think  stronger and better than I was before  What blessed things are   trials and temptations  when we have the strength to resist and subdue   them       But I am uneasy about those same four guineas  I think you should give   them back again to your master  and yet I have broken them  Alas  I have   only three left  but I will borrow the fourth  if I can  part upon my   wages  and part of Mrs  Mumford  and send the whole sum back to you    that you may return it  against John comes next  if he comes again   before you       I want to know how you come  I fancy honest John will be glad to bear   you company part of the way  if your master is not so cross as to forbid   him  And if I know time enough  your mother will go one five miles  and
