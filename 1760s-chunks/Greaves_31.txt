and had no power to proceed  until she had repeated the Lord s Prayer   These remarks made a strong impression on the imagination of Crowe  who asked in some confusion  if she had got that same prayer in print  She made no answer  but reaching the Prayer Book from a shelf  and turning up the leaf  put it into his hand  then the captain having adjusted his spectacles  began to read  or rather spell aloud  with equal eagerness and solemnity  He had refreshed his memory so well as to remember the whole  when the doctor  returning with his companions  gave him to understand that he had procured the key of the chancel  where he might watch his armour as well as in the body of the church  and that he was ready to conduct him to the spot  Crowe was not now quite so forward as he had appeared before  to achieve this adventure  He began to start objections with respect to the borrowed armour  he wanted to stipulate the comforts of a can of flip  and a candle s end  during his vigil  and hinted something of the damage he might sustain from your malicious imps of darkness   The doctor told him  the constitutions of chivalry absolutely required that he should be left in the dark alone  and fasting  to spend the night in pious meditations  but if he had any fears which disturbed his conscience  he had much better desist  and give up all thoughts of knight errantry  which could not consist with the least shadow of apprehension  The captain  stung by this remark  replied not a word  but gathering up the armour into a bundle  threw it on his back  and set out for the place of probation  preceded by Clarke with the lantern  When they arrived at the church  Fillet  who had procured the key from the sexton  who was his patient  opened the door  and conducted our novice into the middle of the chancel  where the armour was deposited  Then bidding Crowe draw his hanger  committed him to the protection of Heaven  assuring him he would come back  and find him either dead or alive by daybreak  and perform the remaining part of the ceremony  So saying  he and the other associates shook him by the hand and took their leave  after the surgeon had tilted up the lantern to take a view of his visage  which was pale and haggard   Before the door was locked upon him  he called aloud   Hilloa  doctor  hip—another word  d ye see   They forthwith returned to know what he wanted  and found him already in a sweat   Hark ye  brother   said he  wiping his face   I do suppose as how one may pass away the time in whistling the Black Joke  or singing Black eyed Susan  or some such sorrowful ditty  — By no means   cried the doctor   such pastimes are neither suitable to the place  nor the occasion  which is altogether a religious exercise  If you have got any psalms by heart  you may sing a stave or two  or repeat the Doxology  — Would I had Tom Laverick here   replied our novitiate   he would sing your anthems like a sea mew—a had been a clerk a shore—many s the time and often I ve given him a rope s end for singing psalms in the larboard watch  Would I had hired the son of a b— h to have taught me a cast of his office—but it cannot be holp  brother—if we can t go large  we must haul up a wind  as the saying is  if we can t sing  we must pray   The company again left him to his devotion  and returned to the public house  in order to execute the essential part of their project             CHAPTER SEVEN  IN WHICH THE KNIGHT RESUMES HIS IMPORTANCE   Doctor Fillet having borrowed a couple of sheets from the landlady  dressed the misanthrope and Tom Clarke in ghostly apparel  which was reinforced by a few drops of liquid phosphorus  from Ferret s vial  rubbed on the foreheads of the two adventurers  Thus equipped  they returned to the church with their conductor  who entered with them softly at an aisle which was opposite to a place where the novice kept watch  They stole unperceived through the body of the church  and though it was so dark that they could not distinguish the captain with the eye  they heard the sound of his steps  as he walked backwards and forwards on the pavement with uncommon expedition  and an ejaculation now and then escaped in a murmur from this lips   The triumvirate having taken their station with a large pew in their front  the two ghosts uncovered their heads  which by the help of the phosphorus exhibited a pale and lambent flame  extremely dismal and ghastly to the view  then Ferret in a squeaking tone  exclaimed   Samuel Crowe  Samuel Crowe   The captain hearing himself accosted in this manner  at such a time  and in such a place  replied   Hilloah   and turning his eyes towards the quarter whence the voice seemed to proceed
