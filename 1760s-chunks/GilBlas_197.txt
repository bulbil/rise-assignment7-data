Don Alphonso to understand that my sentiments coincided with his own  and we resolved at once to separate ourselves from our companions on the following morning before daybreak  We were above the temptation of profiting by their absence  that is  of marching off in a hurry with the sum total of the finances  the confidence they had reposed in leaving us masters of the whole revenue  did not permit such a thought so much as to pass through our minds   Ambrose and Don Raphael returned from Segorba just at the close of day  The first thing they told us was  that their journey had been propitious  for they had laid the corner stone of a rascality which  to all appearance  would turn out still better than that of the evening before  And thereupon the son of Lucinda was going to put us in possession of the details  but Don Alphonse cut him short in his explanation  and declared at once his intention of parting company  I announced my own wish to do the same  To no purpose did they employ all their rhetoric  to prove to us the propriety of our accompanying them in their professional travels  we took leave of them the next morning  after having made an equal division of our cash  and pushed on towards Valencia     CH III     An unfortunate occurrence  which terminated to the high delight of Don Alphonso  Gil Blas meets with an adventure which places him all at once in a very superior situation   We galloped on gaily as far as Bunol  where  as ill luck would have it  we were obliged to stop  Don Alphonso was taken ill  His disorder was a high fever  with such an access of alarming symptoms  as put me in fear for his life  By the greatest mercy in the world  the place was not beset by a single physician  and I got clear off without any harm but my fright  He was quite out of danger at the end of three days  and with my nursing  his recovery was rapid and without relapse  He seemed to be very grateful for my attentions  and as we really and truly felt a liking for each other  we swore an eternal friendship   At length we got on our journey again  in the constant determination  when we arrived at Valencia  of profiting by the first opportunity which might offer to go over into Italy  But heaven disposed of us differently  We saw at the gate of a fine castle some country people of both sexes making merry and dancing in a ring  We went near to be spectators of their revels  and Don Alphonso was never less prepared than for the surprise which all at once came over his senses  He found it was Baron Steinbach  who was as little backward in recognizing him  but ran up to him with open arms  and exclaimed  in accents of unbridled joy    Ah  Don Alphonso  is it you  What a delightful meeting  While search was making for you in every direction  chance presents you to my view   My fellow traveller dismounted immediately  and ran to embrace the baron  whose joy seemed to me of an extravagant nature  Come  my long lost son  said the good old man  you shall now be informed of your own birth  and know the happy destiny that awaits you  As he uttered these words  he conducted him into the castle  I went in along with them  for while they were exchanging salutations  I had alighted and tied our horses to a tree  The lord of the castle was the first person whom we met  He was about the age of fifty  and a very well looking man  Sir  said Baron Steinbach as he introduced Don Alphonso  behold your son  At these words  Don Caesar de Leyva  for by that title the lord of the castle was called  threw his arms round Don Alphonso s neck  and weeping with joy  muttered indistinctly  My dear son  know in me the author of your being  If I have for so long left you in ignorance of your birth and family  rest assured that the self  denial was mine in the most painful degree  I have a thousand times been ready to burst with anxiety  but it was impossible to act otherwise  I had married your mother from sheer attachment  for her origin was very inferior to mine  I lived under the control of an austere father  whose severity rendered it necessary to keep secret a marriage contracted without his sanction  Baron Steinbach  and he alone  was in my confidence  he brought you up at my request  and under my directions  At length my father is laid with his ancestors  and I can own you for my son and heir  This is not all  I can give you for a bride a young lady whose rank is on a level with my own  Sir  interrupted Don Alphonso  make me not pay too dear for the happiness you have just been throwing in my lap  May I not be told that I have the honour of being your son without being informed at the same time that you are determined to make me miserable  Ah  sir  be not more
