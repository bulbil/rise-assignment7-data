very good to put you upon a foot with your brothers  in his bounty to them  as now he   340 has also done in his will  And assure yourself  that his representative  will be equally kind to you as to your brothers  But shall I ask you  as your uncle would have done—Is there any one man in the world  whom you prefer to another   She was silent  looked down  and again picked her handkerchief   I called in her elder brother  not the drug merchant  and asked him  What he knew of his sister s affections   Why  my good Dr  Bartlett  are these women ashamed of owning a laudable passion  Surely there is nothing shameful in discreet Love   Her brother acquainted me with the story of her Love  the good girl blushing  and looking down all the while  with the consciousness of a sweet thief  who had stolen a heart  and being required to restore it  had been guilty of a new cheat  and given her own instead of it   The son of Mr  Galliard  an eminent Turkey merchant  is the man with whom she has made this exchange  His father  who lives in the neighbourhood of her aunt  had sent him abroad  in the way of his traffick  partly with a view to prevent his marrying Miss Danby  till it should be seen whether her uncle would do any thing considerable for her  And he was but just returned  and  in order to be allowed to stay at home  had promised his father never to marry without his consent  But nevertheless loved his sister  Mr  Danby said  above all women  and declared that he never would be the husband of any other   I asked  whether the father had any objections  but those of fortune  to his son s choice  and was answered  No  He could have no other  the young man  like a brother  said  There was not a more virtuous and discreet young woman in the kingdom than his sister  tho  he said it  that should not say it   Tho  you say it  that should say it  Is not our   341 relation intitled to the same justice that we would do to another   We must not blame indiscriminately  continued I  all fathers who expect a fortune to be brought into their family  in some measure equivalent to the benefit the new comer hopes to receive from it  especially in mercantile families  if the young man is to be admitted into a share with his father  who  by the way  may have other children—  He has—  Something by way of equivalent for the part he gives up  should be done  Love is a selfish Deity  He puts two persons upon preferring their own interests  nay  a gratification of their passion often against their interests  to those of every body else  and reason  discretion  duty  are frequently given up in a competition with it  But Love  nevertheless  will not do every thing for the ardent pair  Parents know this  And ought not to pay for the rashness they wish to prevent  but cannot   They were attentive  I proceeded  addressing myself to both in the mercantile style   Is a father  who by his prudence  has weathered many a storm  and got safe into port  obliged to reembark in the voyage of Life  with the young folks  who perhaps in a little while  will consider him as an incumbrance  and grudge him his cabin  Parents  tho  a young man  I have always thought in this manner  should be indulgent  but children  when they put themselves into one scale  should allow the parent his due weight in the other  You are angry at this father  are you not  my dear Miss Danby   I said this  to hear what answer she would return   Indeed I am not  Mr  Galliard knows best his own affairs  and what they require  I have said so twenty and twenty times  And young Mr  Galliard is convinced  that his father is not to be blamed  having other children  And  to own the truth  looking   342 on the floor  we both sit down  and wish together  now and then  But what signifies wishing   My sister will now have two thousand pounds  Perhaps when old Mr  Galliard sees  that his son s affections—  Old Mr  Galliard  interrupted I  shall be asked to do nothing inconvenient to himself  or that is not strictly right by his other children  Nor shall the niece of my late worthy friend enter into his family  with discredit to herself   Notice being given  that supper was ready  I took the brother and sister each by the hand  and  entering the drawing room with them  Enjoy  said I  the little repast that will be set before you  If it be in my power to make you all three happy  happy you shall be   It must give great pleasure  my dear Dr  Bartlett  you will believe  to a man of my lively
