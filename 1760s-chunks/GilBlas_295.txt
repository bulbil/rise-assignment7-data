I drew him aside  saying  Go  my good fellow  sit down quietly at the inn  and leave me here with my only surviving parent  who might consider your company as an intrusion  while talking over family affairs  Scipio withdrew  for fear of being a clog upon our confidence  and I sat down with my mother to an interchange of communication  which lasted all night  We reciprocally gave a faithful account of all that had happened to each of us  since my first sally from Oviedo  She related  in full measure and running over  all the petty insults  disappointments  and mortifications  which she had undergone in her pilgrimage from house to house as a duenna  A great number of these little anecdotes it would have hurt my pride that my secretary should have noted down in his biographical budget  though I had never concealed from him the ups and downs in the lottery of my own life  With all the respect I owe to my mother s sainted memory  the good lady had not the knack of going the shortest road to the end of a story  had she but pruned her own memoirs of all luxuriant circumstances  there would not have been materials for more than a tithe of her narrative   At length she got to the end of her tether  and I began my career  With respect to my general adventures  I passed them over lightly  but when I came to speak of the visit which the son of Bertrand Muscada  the grocer of Oviedo  had paid me at Madrid  I enlarged with decent compunction on that dark article in the history of my life  I must frankly own  said I to my mother  that I gave that young fellow a very bad reception  and he  doubtless  in revenge  must have drawn a hideous outline of my moral features  He did you more than justice  I trust  answered she  for he told us that he found you so puffed and swollen with the good fortune thrust upon you by the prime minister  as scarcely to acknowledge him among your former acquaintance  and when he gave you a moving description of our miseries  you listened as if you had no interest in the tale  or knowledge of the parties  But as fathers and mothers can always find some clue for palliation in the conduct of their graceless children  we were loath to believe that you had so bad a heart  Your arrival at Oviedo justifies our favourable interpretation  and those tears which are now flowing down your cheeks  are so many pledges either of your innocence or your reformation   Your constructions were too partial  replied I  there was a great deal of truth in young Muscada s report  When he came to see me all my faculties were engrossed by vanity and mammon  ambition  the prevailing devil which possessed me  left not a thought to throw away on the desolate condition of my parents  It therefore could be no wonder  if in such a disposition of mind I gave rather a freezing reception to a man who  accosting me in a peremptory style  took upon him to say  without mincing the matter  that it was well known I was as rich as a Jew  and therefore he advised me to send you a good round sum  seeing that you were very much put to your shifts  nay  he went so far as to reproach me  in phrase of more sincerity than good manners  with my unfeeling negligence of my family  His confounded personality stuck in my throat  so that losing my little stock of patience  I shoved him fairly by the shoulders out of my closet  It must be confessed that I took the administration of justice a little too much into my own hands  being judge and party in the same cause  neither was it proper that you should bear the brunt  because the grocer was a little anti saccharine in his phraseology  nor was his advice the less pertinent or just  though couched in homely terms  or urged with plodding vulgarity   All this came plump in the teeth of my conscience  the moment I had turned Muscada out of doors  The voice of natural instinct contrived to make its way  my duty to my parents brought the blood into my face  but it was the blush of shame for its neglect  and not the glow of triumph at its performance  Yet even my remorse can give me little credit in your eyes  since it was soon stifled in the fumes of avarice and ambition  But some time afterwards  having been safely lodged in the tower of Segovia by royal mandate  I fell dangerously ill there  and that timely remembrancer was the cause of bringing back your son to you  So true is it  that sickness and imprisonment were my best moral tutors  for they enabled nature to resume her rights  and weaned me effectually from the court  Henceforth all my dear delight is in solitude  and my only business in the Asturias is to entreat that you would share with me in the mild pleasures of a retired life  If you reject not my earnest petition  I will attend you to an estate of mine in the kingdom of Valencia  and we will live there together very comfortably  You are of
