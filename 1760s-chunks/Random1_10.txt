mend his manners  and behave for the future  as became him —The honest tar  whose pride and indignation boiled within him  answered my grandfather  that it was true he had sent him to school  but it had cost him nothing  for he had never been at one shilling expence  to furnish him with food  raiment  books  or other necessaries  so  that it was not to be much wondered at  if the boy made small progress  and yet  whoever told him so  was guilty of a damn d lie  for he was allowed by those who understood those matters  to be the best scholar of his age  in all the country  the truth of which he would maintain  by laying a wager of his whole half year s pay on the boy s head — with these words he pulled out his purse  and challenged the company  —Neither is he addicted to vice  as you affirm  but very much exposed to ill usage  by your neglect  on which occasions  d ye see  he never fails to shew his spirit  which has been misrepresented to you —As for what   18 happened to your chaplain  I am only sorry  that he did not knock out the scoundrel s brains  instead of his teeth —By the Lord  if ever I come up with him  he had better be in Greenland —that s all —Thank you for your courteous offer  of binding the lad apprentice to a tradesman  I suppose you would make a taylor of him—would you —I had rather see him hang d  d ye see —Come along  Rory  I perceive how the land lies  my boy —let s tack about  i  faith —while I have a shilling thou shan t want a tester —B wye  old gentleman  you re bound for the other world  but I believe damnably ill provided for the voyage —Thus ended our visit  and we returned to the village  my uncle muttering curses all the way against the old shark and the young fry that surrounded him     CHAP  IV   My grandfather makes his will —Our second visit—he dies—his will is read in presence of all his living descendants—the disappointment of my female cousins—my uncle s behaviour   A FEW weeks after our first visit  we were informed that the old judge  after a fit of thoughtfulness  which lasted three days  had sent for a notary and made his will  that the distemper had mounted from his legs to his stomach  and being conscious of his approaching end  he had desired to see all his descendants without exception —In obedience to this summons  my   19 uncle set out with me a second time  to receive the last benediction of my grandfather  often repeating by the road     Ey  ey  we have brought up the old hulk at last —You shall see —you shall see the effect of my admonition  —  When we entered his chamber  which was crowded with his relations  we advanced to the bed side  where we sound him in his last agonies  supported by two of his grand daughters  who sat on each side of him  fobbing most piteously  and wiping away the froth and slaver as it gathered on his lips  which they frequently kissed with a shew of great anguish and affection —I know not whether or not he perceived my uncle  who approached him with these words    What  he s not a weigh —How fare ye —how fare ye  old gentleman —Lord have mercy upon your poor sinful soul  —  But the dying man turned his sunken eyes towards us —when my uncle went on —   Here s poor Rory come to see you before you die and receive your blessing —What man  don t despair —you have been a great sinner   tis true —what then  There s a righteous judge above —isn t there  He minds me no more than a porpuss —Yes  yes  he s a going —the land crabs will have him  I see that —his anchor s a peak  i  faith  —  This homely consolation scandalized the company so much  and especially the parson  who probably thought his province invaded  that we were obliged to retire into another room  where in a few minutes  we were convinced of my grandfather s decease  by a dismal yell uttered by the young ladies in his apartment  whither we immediately hastened  and found his heir  who had retired a little   20 before  into a closet under pretence of giving vent to his sorrow  asking  with a countenance beslubbered with tears  if his grandpapa was certainly dead —   Dead   says my uncle  looking at the body  ay  ay  I ll warrant him as dead as a herring —Odd s fish  now my dream is out for all the world —I thought I stood upon the Fore castle  and saw a parcel of carrion crows foul of a dead shark that floated alongside  and the devil perching on our sprit failyard  in the likeness of a blue bear—who  d ye see  jumped over board upon the carcase  and carried it to the bottom in his claws  —   Out upon thee  reprobate  cries the parson
