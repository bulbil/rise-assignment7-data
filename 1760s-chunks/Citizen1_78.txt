 I cannot help fancying that the genius of freedom has entered that kingdom in disguise  If they have but three weak monarchs more  successively on the throne  the mask will be laid aside  and the country will certainly once more be free   When I compare the figure which the Dutch make in Europe with that they assume in Asia  I am struck with surprize  In Asia  I find them the great Lords of all the Indian seas  in Europe the timid inhabitants of a paltry state  No longer the sons of freedom  but of avarice  no longer assertors of their rights by courage  but by negotiations  fawning on those who insult them  and crouching under the rod of every neighbouring power  Without a friend to save them in distress  and without virtue to save themselves  their government is poor  and their private wealth will serve but to invite some neigbouring invader   I long with impatience for your letters from England  Denmark  Holland  and Italy  yet why wish for relations which only describe new calamities  which shew that ambition and avarice are equally terrible in every region   Adieu     246  LETTER LV  From Lien Chi Altangi  to Fum Hoam  first president of the Ceremonial Academy  at Pekin  in China   I Have frequently admired the manner of criticising in China  where the learned are assembled in a body to judge of every new publication  to examine the merits of the work without knowing the circumstances of the author  and then to usher it into the world with the proper marks of respect or reprobation   In England there are no such tribunals erected  but if a man thinks proper to be a judge of genius  few will be at the pains to contradict his pretensions  If any chuse to be critics  it is but saying they are critics  and from that time forward they become invested with full power and authority over every caitiff who aims at their instruction or entertainment   As almost every member of society has by this means a vote in literary transactions  it is no way surprizing to find the rich leading the way here as in other common concerns of life  to see them either bribing the numerous herd of voters by their interest  or brow beating them by their authority   A great man says  at his table  that such a book is no bad thing  Immediately the praise is carried off by five flatterers to be dispersed at twelve different coffee houses  from whence it circulates  still improving as it proceeds  through forty five houses    247 where cheaper liquors are sold  from thence it is carried away by the honest tradesman to his own fire side  where the applause is eagerly caught up by his wife and children who have been long taught to regard his judgment as the standard of perfection  Thus when we have traced a wide extended literary reputation up to its original source  we shall find it derived from some great man  who has  perhaps  received all his education and English from a tutor of Berne  or a dancing master of Picardie   The English are a people of good sense  and I am the more surprized to find them sway d in their opinions  by men who often from  their very education  are incompetent judges  Men who being always bred in affluence  see the world only on one side  are surely improper judges of human nature  they may indeed describe a ceremony  a ant or a ball  but how can they pretend to dive into the secrets of the human heart  who have been nursed up only in forms  and daily behold nothing but the same insipid adulation smiling upon every face  Few of them have been bred in that best of schools  the school of adversity  and by what I can learn  fewer still have been bred in any school at all   From such a description one would think  that a droning Duke  or a Dowager Duchess  was not possessed of more just pretensions to taste than persons of less quality  and yet whatever the one or the other may write or praise  shall pass for perfection  without farther examinatior  A nobleman has but to take pen  ink  and paper  and write away through three large   248 volumes  and then sign his name to the title   tho  the whole might have been before more disgusting than his own rent roll  yet signing his name and title gives value to the deed  title being alone equivalent to taste  imagination  and genius   As soon as a piece therefore is published the first questions are  Who is the author  Does he keep a coach  Where lies his estate  What sort of a table does he keep  If he happens to be poor and unqualified for such a scrutiny  he and his works sink into irremediable obscurity  and too late he finds  that having fed upon Turtle is a more ready way to fame than having digested Tully   The poor devil  against whom fashion has set its face  vainly alledges  that he has been bred in every part of Europe where knowledge was to be sold  that he has grown pale in the study of nature and himself
