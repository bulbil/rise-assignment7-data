some observed a perfect neutrality  Several frequently petitioned for peace  the wise and the good were most earnest in this cry  but what particularly deserved remark was  the attempt of the women of London  who  to the number of two or three thousand  went in a body to the house of commons  earnestly demanding a peace    Give us those traitors  said they  that are against peace  give them  that we may tear them in pieces    The guards found some difficulty in quelling this insurrection  and one or two women lost their lives in the fray     It is both tedious and unimproving to describe all the combats  the battles  the skirmishes  that every day passed between either side  What towns were besieged and taken  how many killed in fight  or what numbers died by the hand of the executioner  every civil war presents the same picture to the imagination    27 and this was aggravated with all the miseries of rage  resentment  and despair  All were from principle earnestly employed in destroying the constitution  there were none of those refined understandings  who  disengaged from the prejudices of party  improved the universal prejudice of the time to acquire dominion for themselves  all were seriously  earnestly  and blindly engaged in the favourite pursuit  The genius of the times was great but irregular   Among the number who most severely felt the indignation of the commons  was the famous William Laud  Archbishop of Canterbury  he had been imprisoned in the Tower  at the time when nine more of the Bishops were sent there upon remonstrating to the Lords against the severity of the lower house  When he was brought to the bar  in order to make his defence  he spoke several hours with that courage which is the result of innocence and integrity  The Lords  his Judges  were willing to acquit him  but the commons were determined upon his death  and over ruled all remonstrances made in his favour  When brought to the scaffold  this noble divine  without any apparent terror  made the people a long speech  he told them     that he had examined his heart  and thanked God that he found no sins there which deserved the death he was going to suffer  The King had been traduced by some  as labouring to introduce Popery  but that he believed him as sound a Protestant as any man in the kingdom  and as for parliaments  though he disliked the conduct of one or two  yet he never designed to change the laws of the country  or the Protestant religion    After he had prayed for a short space  the executioner did his office at …e blow  This man seemed born for a better on fate and better times  but all distinctions of right and wrong were now lost in mutual animosity  and in general the best characters on both sides were those   28 who fell victims to civil fury  He was learned  upright  and sincere  humble in his private deportment  but attached to trifling ceremonies  and ready to lose his life rather than give them up     The liturgy was  by a public act  abolished the day he died  as if he had been the only obstacle to its former removal  The church of England was rendered completely Presbyterian  to the great satisfaction of the Scots  and numbers of the citizens of London  An ordinance was established  by which there should be one day in the week appointed as a fast  and the money which was thus spared to the family  was to be paid in support of the common cause  Thus strengthened  the parliament seemed capable of carrying on their designs in an arbitrary manner  they had the Scotch to assist them  they professed only one religion  and were united with the bonds of mutual danger  However  from the moment they came to be all ranked under the denomination of Presbyterians  they began again to separate into new parties  as if divisions were necessary to the existence of this parliament  one part of the house were Presbyterians  strictly so called  the other Independants  a new sect that had lately been introduced  and gained ground surprisingly  The difference between these two sects would hardly be worth mentioning  did not their religious opinions influence their political conduct  The church of England  which was now totally abolished  had appointed Bishops and a book of common prayer  the Presbyterians exclaimed against both  they were for having the church governed by clergymen elected by the people  The Independants went yet still farther  and excluded all clergy  they maintained that every man might pray in public  exhort his audience  and explain the scriptures  but their chief difference lay in acknowledging no subordination in secular employments  and attempting to maintain an   29 ideal equality  to which they justly observed that every man was born  Were such a plan of government practicable  it would no doubt be the most happy  but the wise and powerful must ever govern over ignorance and debility  and the bad success of their schemes  soon after carried into execution  shewed how ill adapted they were to human infirmity  Possessed  however  with an high opinion of their speculative scheme
