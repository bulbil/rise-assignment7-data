      Yet  after all  you ll see I have not the easiest task in the world  But   I know my own intentions  that I shall not wilfully err  and so fear the   less       Not one hint did he give  that I durst lay hold of  about poor Miss   Sally Godfrey  I wish my lady had not spoken of it  for it has given me   a curiosity that is not quite so pretty in me  especially so early in my   nuptials  and in a case so long ago past  Yet he intimated too  to his   sister  that he had had other faults   of this sort  I suppose   that   had not come to her knowledge   But I make no doubt he has seen his   error  and will be very good for the future  I wish it  and pray it may   be so  for his own dear sake          Wednesday  the seventh       When I arose in the morning  I went to wait on Lady Davers  seeing her   door open  and she was in bed  but awake  and talking to her woman  I   said  I hope I don t disturb your ladyship  Not at all  said she  I am   glad to see you  How do you do  Well  added she  when do you set out for   Bedfordshire   I said  I can t tell  madam  it was designed as to day    but I have heard no more of it       Sit down  said she  on the bed side   I find  by the talk we had   yesterday and last night  you have had but a poor time of it  Pamela   I   must call you so yet  said she   since you were brought to this house    till within these few days  And Mrs  Jewkes too has given Beck such an   account  as makes me pity you       Indeed  madam  said I  if your ladyship knew all  you would pity me  for   never poor creature was so hard put to it  But I ought to forget it all   now  and be thankful       Why  said she  as far as I can find   tis a mercy you are here now  I   was sadly moved with some part of your story and you have really made a   noble defence  and deserve the praises of all our sex       It was God enabled me  madam  replied I  Why  said she   tis the more   extraordinary  because I believe  if the truth was known  you loved the   wretch not a little  While my trials lasted  madam  said I  I had not a   thought of any thing  but to preserve my innocence  much less of love       But  tell me truly  said she  did you not love him all the time  I had   always  madam  answered I  a great reverence for my master  and thought   all his good actions doubly good and for his naughty ones  though I   abhorred his attempts upon me  yet I could not hate him  and always   wished him well  but I did not know that it was love  Indeed I had not   the presumption       Sweet girl  said she  that s prettily said  But when he found he could   not gain his ends  and began to be sorry for your sufferings  and to   admire your virtue  and to profess honourable love to you  what did you   think       Think  Indeed  madam  I did not know what to think  could neither hope   nor believe so great an honour would fall to my lot  and feared more   from his kindness  for some time  than I had done from his unkindness    And  having had a private intimation  from a kind friend  of a sham   marriage  intended by means of a man who was to personate a minister  it   kept my mind in too much suspense  to be greatly overjoyed at his kind   declaration       Said she  I think he did make two or three attempts upon you in   Bedfordshire  Yes  madam  said I  he was very naughty  to be sure       And here he proposed articles to you  I understand  Yes  madam  replied   I  but I abhorred so much the thoughts of being a kept creature  that   I rejected them with great boldness  and was resolved to die before I   would consent to them
