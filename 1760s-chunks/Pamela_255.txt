again  in her walks  having   not pulled down the sash  when I spoke to Mrs  Jewkes  I got upon the   seat  and whipped out in a minute  and ran away as hard as I could   drive  my lady calling after me to return  and her woman at the other   window  But two of her servants appearing at her crying out  and she   bidding them to stop me  I said  Touch me at your peril  fellows    But their lady s commands would have prevailed on them  had not Mr    Colbrand  who  it seems  had been kindly ordered  by Mrs  Jewkes  to be   within call  when she saw how I was treated  come up  and put on one of   his deadly fierce looks  the only time  I thought  it ever became him    and said  He would chine the man  that was his word  who offered to   touch his lady  and so he ran alongside of me  and I heard my lady say    The creature flies like a bird  And  indeed  Mr  Colbrand  with his huge   strides  could hardly keep pace with me  and I never stopped  till I   got to the chariot  and Robert had got down  seeing me running at a   distance  and held the door in his hand  with the step ready down  and   in I jumped  without touching the step  saying  Drive me  drive me  as   fast as you can  out of my lady s reach  And he mounted  and Colbrand   said  Don t be frightened  madam  nobody shall hurt you   And shut the   door  and away Robert drove  but I was quite out of breath  and did not   recover it  and my fright  all the way       Mr  Colbrand was so kind  but I did not know it till the chariot stopped   at Sir Simon s  to step up behind the carriage  lest  as he said  my   lady should send after me  and he told Mrs  Jewkes  when he got home    that he never saw such a runner as me in his life       When the chariot stopped  which was not till six o clock  so long did   this cruel lady keep me  Miss Darnford ran out to me  O madam  said she    ten times welcome  but you ll be beat  I can tell you  for here has been   Mr  B     come these two hours  and is very angry with you       That s hard indeed  said I   Indeed I can t afford it   for I hardly   knew what I said  having not recovered my fright  Let me sit down  miss    any where  said I  for I have been sadly off  So I sat down  and was   quite sick with the hurry of my spirits  and leaned upon her arm       Said she  Your lord and master came in very moody  and when he had staid   an hour  and you not come  he began to fret  and said  He did not expect   so little complaisance from you  And he is now sat down  with great   persuasion  to a game at loo   Come  you must make your appearance  lady   fair  for he is too sullen to attend you  I doubt       You have no strangers  have you miss  said I   Only two women relations   from Stamford  replied she  and an humble servant of one of them   Only   all the world  miss  said I   What shall I do  if he be angry  I can t   bear that       Just as I had said so  came in Lady Darnford and Lady Jones to chide me    as they said  for not coming sooner  And before I could speak  came in   my dear master  I ran to him  How dy e Pamela  said he  and saluting me    with a little more formality than I could well bear   I expected half   a word from me  when I was so complaisant to your choice  would have   determined you  and that you d have been here to dinner   and the   rather  as I made my request a reasonable one  and what I thought would   be agreeable to you  O dear sir  said I  pray  pray  hear me  and you ll   pity me  and not be displeased  Mrs  Jewkes will tell you  that as   soon as I had your kind commands  I said  I would obey you  and come to
