shall be cut off at once from enjoyment  and from hope  and   the dreadful moment is now at hand   While he was speaking  the palace   again shook  and he stood again in the presence of the Genius        ALMORAN   said the inhabitant of the unapparent world   the evil which   thou fearest  shall not be upon thee  Make haste  and shew thyself from   the gallery to the people  and the tumult of faction shall be still   before thee  tell them  that their rebellion is not against thee only    but against Him by whom thou reignest  appeal boldly to that power for a   confirmation of thy words  and rely for the attesting sign upon me     ALMORAN  who had stooped with his face to the ground  now looked upward    and found himself alone  he hasted  therefore  to follow the directions   he had received  and hope was again kindled in his bosom       Osmyn  in the mean time  made a proper disposition of the troops now   under his command  and had directed a select company to remain near the   person of the king  that they might at least make good his retreat    While he was waiting at his post  and revolving in his mind the total   disappointment of his hopes  and considering what he should do if HAMET   should establish himself alone  he was joined by Caled       Caled had a secret enmity against Osmyn  as his rival in the favour of   ALMORAN  but as he had concealed his own pretensions from Osmyn  Osmyn   had no ill will against Caled  As they were now likely to be involved   in one common calamity  by the ruin of the prince whose party they had   espoused  Caled s enmity subsided  and the indifference of Osmyn was   warmed into kindness  mutual distress produced mutual confidence  and   Caled  after condoling with Osmyn on their present hopeless situation    proposed that they should draw off their forces  and revolt to HAMET    This proposition Osmyn rejected  not only from principle  but from   interest   Now we have accepted of a trust   said he   we ought not to   betray it  If we had gone over to HAMET  when he first declared against   his brother  he would have received us with joy  and probably have   rewarded our service  but I know  that his virtue will abhor us for   treachery  though practised in his favour  treachery  under the dominion   of HAMET  will not only cover us with dishonour  but will probably   devote us to death        In this reasoning  Caled could not but acquiesce  he felt himself   secretly but forcibly reproved  by the superior virtue of Osmyn  and   while he regretted his having made a proposal  which had been rejected   not only as imprudent but infamous  he concluded  that Osmyn would ever   after suspect and despise him  and he  therefore  from a new cause    conceived new enmity against him  They parted  however  without any   appearance of suspicion or disgust  and  in a short time  they were in   circumstances very different from their expectations                   VOLUME SECOND            CHAP  XI          ALMORAN had now reached the gallery  and when the multitude saw him    they shouted as in triumph  and demanded that he should surrender    HAMET  who also perceived him at a distance  and was unwilling that any   violence should be offered to his person  pressed forward  and when he   was come near  commanded silence  At this moment ALMORAN  with a loud   voice  reproached them with impiety and folly  and appealing to the   power  whom in his person they had offended  the air suddenly grew dark    a flood of lightning descended from the sky  and a peal of thunder was   articulated into these words         Divided sway  the God who reigns alone     Abhors  and gives to ALMORAN the throne       The multitude stood aghast at the prodigy  and hiding their faces with   their hands  every one departed in silence and confusion  and HAMET and   OMAR were left alone  OMAR was taken by some of the soldiers who had   adhered to ALMORAN  but HAMET made his escape       ALMORAN  whose wishes were thus far accomplished by the intervention of   a power superior to his own  exulted in the anticipation of that   happiness which he now supposed to be secured  and was fortified in his   opinion
