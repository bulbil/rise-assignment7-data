  LONGSWORD  EARL of SALISBURY  AN HISTORICAL ROMANCE     VOLUME THE SECOND     DUBLIN  Printed by GEORGE FAULKNER  in Parliament Street  MDCCLXVI           LONGSWORD  Earl of SALISBURY                                            BOOK IV              SECT  I     IN the religious house to which Oswald had retired  was a Monk  called  Reginhald  whose mind but ill suited his profession  or his residence in  a seat of piety  He was brother to Grey  and by his interest had been  not long since admitted into the Monastery  and promoted to some degree  of dignity and authority  His manners were equally brutal with those of  Grey  but less disguised by art and hypocrisy  He was like him  abject  and servile  but by no means so well skilled in the arts of flattery   insolent and assuming  but not careful to distinguish between those who  feared and those who defied his power  Hence was he frequently  controuled and mortified by his brethren  whom he dreaded from a  consciousness of his own excesses  and who detested and scorned him  indeed  yet feared the power which supported  or seemed to support him   They regarded his brother as the favourite of Lord Raymond  and Lord  Raymond as heir to the house of Salisbury  and already possessed of all  its greatness  To purchace his protection  therefore  they turned their  eyes from his offences  and suffered him to disgrace and disturb their  house by scandalous excesses  utterly subversive of holy discipline and  order  Drunkenness  and riot  and lewdness  had oftentimes profaned  their walls with impunity  They lamented  these enormities of their unworthy brother  but  instead of disclosing  and punishing them  lamented to each other in secret  lest they should  forfeit the favour and protection of Lord Raymond  although the  miscreant had been scarcely known  and was utterly unnoticed and  disregarded by this Lord     Grey had conceived a sudden hope of preventing the effects which the  flight of Oswald threatened  by means of this Reginhald  and  if not of  gaining young William into his own power  at least of preventing any  emissaries from spreading the intelligence of his escape to sanctuary   and the distresses of his mother  This it was that determined him to  depart instantly  and to visit this monastery  but his brother  active  and officious in every deed of baseness  had already prevented his  desires  Oswald had happily reached the monastery  and Reginhald was  among the first to demand the reason of his appearance  Scarcely could  he restrain his passion until Oswald had compleated his story  and   then  burst forth with unbounded rage into the vilest and severest  reproaches  He charged him with falsehood and treachery  declared  himself resolved instantly to learn the real nature of his crime  and  purpose of his flight  and  for this reason  to repair in person to the  castle  In the mean time  with an assumed air of authority  he ordered  that this fugitive should be strictly guarded  and kept from all  intercourse till his return  Oswald heard his brutal virulence and  passion  not without some terror  which was noted  and regarded as an  indication of guilt  The directions of Reginhald were obeyed  and he  himself now hastened to inform his brother of this event  He met him  when he had but just rode a few paces from the castle  whither Grey  instantly returned with the Monk     They retired to a private conference with equal eagerness  and with  minds equally prepared for outrage or treachery  The Monk prevented the  enquiries of his brother  by relating what had just now passed at the  monastery  Grey expressed a sullen joy  when informed that Oswald was  closely guarded  and  for the  present  effectually prevented from spreading his saucy tale  or  pursuing the design for which he had fled  He commended the zeal of  Reginhald  and  seizing his arm with an aspect  earnest  and  mysteriously solemn  he declared  that both their future fortunes  depended on confining Oswald from all intercourse  and gaining young  William into their own power and disposal  The rude Monk  whose first  thoughts were ever to recur to violence  instantly declared for seizing  both  and forcing them from their retreat  but he was stopped by Grey   who censured such procedure as dangerous and unwarrantable  and  pronounced it necessary to pursue measures the most deliberate and most  cautiously concerted  He proceeded to disclose all the transactions of  Lord Raymond from his first arrival at the castle of Salisbury  all the  efforts made to shake the constancy of Ela  and all the opposition and  disdain of that proud Countess  He began
