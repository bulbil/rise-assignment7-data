habitual reverence of sovereign power  now surmounted all   other passions in the bosom of ALMEIDA  she was instantly covered with   new confusion  and hiding her face with her hands  threw herself at his   feet  he raised her with a trepidation almost equal to her own  and   endeavoured to sooth her into confidence and tranquillity       Hitherto her memory had been wholly suspended by violent passions  which   had crowded upon her in a rapid and uninterrupted succession  and the   first gleam of recollection threw her into a new agony  and having been   silent a few moments  she suddenly smote her hands together  and   bursting into tears  cried out   Abdallah  my father  my father    HAMET   not only knew but felt all the meaning of the exclamation  and   immediately ran again into the garden  he had advanced but a few paces    before he discerned an old man sitting upon the ground  and looking   upward in silent anguish  as if he had exhausted the power of complaint    HAMET  upon a nearer approach  perceived by the light of the flame that   it was Abdallah  and instantly calling him by his name  told him  that   his daughter was safe  At the name of his daughter  Abdallah suddenly   started up  as if he had been roused by the voice of an angel from the   sleep of death  HAMET again repeated  that his daughter was in safety    and Abdallah looking wistfully at him  knew him to be the king  He was   then struck with an awe that restrained him from enquiry  but HAMET   directing him where he might find her  went forward  that he might not   lessen the pleasure of their interview  nor restrain the first   transports of duty and affection by his presence  He soon met with other   fugitives from the fire  which had opened a communication between the   gardens and the street  and among them some women belonging to ALMEIDA    whom  he conducted himself to their mistress  He immediately allotted to   her and to her father  an apartment in his division of the palace  and   the fire being now nearly extinguished  he retired to rest                CHAP  VI          Though the night was far advanced  yet the eyes of HAMET were strangers   to sleep  his fancy incessantly repeated the events that had just   happened  the image of ALMEIDA was ever before him  and his breast   throbbed with a disquietude  which  though it prevented rest  he did not   wish to lose       ALMORAN  in the mean time  was slumbering away the effects of his   intemperance  and in the morning  when he was told what had happened  he   expressed no passion but curiosity  he went hastily into the garden    but when he had gazed upon the ruins  and enquired how the fire began    and what it had consumed  he thought of it no more       But HAMET suffered nothing that regarded himself  to exclude others from   his attention  he went again to the ruins  not to gratify his curiosity    but to see what might yet be done to alleviate the misery of the   sufferers  and secure for their use what had been preserved from the   flames  He found that no life had been lost  but that many persons had   been hurt  to these he sent the physicians of his own houshold  and   having rewarded those who had assisted them in their distress  not   forgetting even the soldiers who had only fulfilled his own orders  he   returned  and applied himself to dispatch the public business in the   chamber of council  with the same patient and diligent attention as if   nothing had happened  He had  indeed  ordered enquiry to be made after   ALMEIDA  and when he returned to his apartment  he found Abdallah   waiting to express his gratitude for the obligations he had received       HAMET accepted his acknowledgements with a peculiar pleasure  for they   had some connexion with ALMEIDA  after whom he again enquired  with an   ardour uncommon even to the benevolence of HAMET  When all his questions   had been asked and answered  he appeared still unwilling to dismiss   Abdallah  though he seemed at a loss how to detain him  he wanted to   know  whether his daughter had yet received an offer of marriage  though   he was unwilling to discover his desire by a direct enquiry  but he soon   found  that nothing could be known  which was not directly asked  from a   man whom reverence and humility kept silent before him  except when   something was said which amounted to a command to speak
