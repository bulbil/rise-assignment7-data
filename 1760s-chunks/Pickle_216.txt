most honourable and respectful  sentiments     Respectful sentiments   cried my lady  with a look of  ineffable disdain   if I thought the fellow had assurance enough to  think of me in any shape  I protest I would forbid him my house  Upon my  honour  such instances of audacity should induce persons of quality to  keep your small gentry at a greater distance  for they are very apt to  grow impudent  upon the least countenance or encouragement    Cadwallader  satisfied with this declaration  changed the subject of  discourse  and next day communicated his discovery to his friend Pickle     6 22 15  3 45 PM   who upon this occasion felt the most stinging sensations of mortified  pride  and resolved to quit his prospect with a good grace  Nor did the  execution of this self denying scheme cost him one moment s uneasiness   for his heart had never been interested in the pursuit  and his vanity  triumphed in the thoughts of manifesting his indifference  Accordingly   the very next time he visited her grace  his behaviour was remarkably  frank  sprightly and disengaged  and the subject of love being  artfully introduced by the widow  who had been directed to sound his  inclinations  he rallied the passion with great ease and severity and  made no scruple of declaring himself heart whole  Though the duchess  had resented his supposed affection  she was now offended at his  insensibility  and even signified her disgust  by observing  that  perhaps his attention to his own qualifications screened him from the  impression of all other objects   While he enjoyed this sarcasm  the meaning of which he could plainly  discern  the company was joined by a certain virtuoso  who had gained  free access to all the great families of the land  by his noble talent  of gossiping and buffoonery  He was now in the seventy fifth year of his  age  his birth was so obscure  that he scarce knew his father s name   his education suitable to the dignity of his descent  his character  publicly branded with homicide  profligacy  and breach of trust  yet  this man  by the happy inheritance of impregnable effrontery  and a  lucky prostitution of all principle in rendering himself subservient to  the appetites of the great  had attained to an independency of fortune   as well as to such a particular share of favour among the quality  that   although he was well known to have pimped for three generations of the  nobility  there was not a lady of fashion in the kingdom who scrupled to  admit him to her toilette  or even to be squired by him in any place of  public entertainment  Not but that this sage was occasionally useful to  his fellow creatures  by these connections with people of fortune  for  he often undertook to solicit charity in behalf of distressed objects   with a view of embezzling one half of the benefactions  It was an errand  of this kind that now brought him to the house of her grace   After having sat a few minutes  he told the company that he would favour  them with a very proper opportunity to extend their benevolence  for the  relief of a poor gentlewoman  who was reduced to the most abject misery   by the death of her husband  and just delivered of a couple of fine  boys  they  moreover  understood from his information  that this object  was daughter of a good family  who had renounced her in consequence  of her marrying an ensign without a fortune  and even obstructed  his promotion with all their influence and power  a circumstance of  barbarity which had made such an impression upon his mind  as disordered  his brain  and drove him to despair  in a fit of which he had made away  with himself  leaving his wife  then big with child  to all the horrors  of indigence and grief   Various were the criticisms on this pathetic picture  which the old man  drew with great expression  My lady duchess concluded that she must be  a creature void of all feeling and reflection  who could survive such  aggravated misery  therefore did not deserve to be relieved  except in  the character of a common beggar  and was generous enough to offer a  recommendation  by which she would be admitted into an infirmary   to which her grace was a subscriber  at the same time advising the  solicitor to send the twins to the Foundling Hospital  where they could  be carefully nursed and brought up  so as to become useful members to    6 22 15  3 45 PM   the commonwealth  Another lady  with all due deference to the opinion of  the duchess  was free enough to blame the generosity of her grace  which  would only serve to encourage children in disobedience to their parents   and might be the means not only of prolonging the distress of the  wretched creature  but also of ruining the constitution of some young  heir  perhaps the hope of a great family  for she did suppose that  madam  when
