is but a ninny  The size of the little death dealer made me hold his anger cheap  I gave him a sharp retort  he sent back as good as I brought  till at last we came to cuffs  We had pulled a few handfuls of hair from each other s heads before the grocer and his kinsman could part us  When they had brought this about  they feed me for my attendance  and retained my antagonist  whom they thought the more skilful of the two   Another adventure succeeded close on the heels of this  I went to see a huge chanter in a fever  As soon as he heard me talk of warm water  he showed himself so averse to this specific  as to fall into a fit of swearing  He abused me in all possible shapes  and threatened to throw me out at window  I was in a greater hurry to get out of his house than to get in  I did not choose to see any more patients that day  and repaired to the inn where I had agreed to meet Fabricio  He was there first  As we found ourselves in a tippling humour  we drank hard  and returned to our employers in a pretty pickle  that is to say  so so in the upper story  Signor Sangrado was not aware of my being drunk  because he took the lively gestures which accompanied the relation of my quarrel with the little doctor  for an effect of the agitation not yet subsided after the battle  Besides  he came in for his share in my report  and feeling himself nettled by Cuchillo    You have done well  Gil Blas  said he  to defend the character of our practice against this little abortion of the faculty  So he takes upon him to set his face against watery drenches in dropsical cases  An ignorant fellow  I maintain  I do  in my own person  that the use of them may be reconciled to the best theories  Yes  water is a cure for all sorts of dropsies  just as it is good for rheumatisms and the green sickness  It is excellent  too  in those fevers where the effect is at once to parch and to chill  and even miraculous in those disorders ascribed to cold  thin  phlegmatic  and pituitous humours  This opinion may seem strange to young practitioners like Cuchillo  but it is right orthodox in the best and soundest systems  so that if persons of that description were capable of taking a philosophical view  instead of crying me down  they would become my most zealous advocates   In his rage  he never suspected me of drinking  for  to exasperate him still more against the little doctor  I had thrown into my recital some circumstances of my own addition  Yet  engrossed as he was by what I had told him  he could not help taking notice that I drank more water than usual that evening   In fact  the wine had made me very thirsty  Any one but Sangrado would have distrusted my being so very dry  as to swallow down glass after glass  but as for him  he took it for granted  in the simplicity of his heart  that I began to acquire a relish for aqueous potations  Apparently  Gil Blas  said he with a gracious smile  you have no longer such a dislike to water  As heaven is my judge  you quaff it off like nectar  It is no wonder  my friend  I was certain you would take a liking to that liquor  Sir  replied I  there is a tide in the affairs of men  with my present lights  I would give all the wine in Valladolid for a pint of water  This answer delighted the doctor  who would not lose so fine an opportunity of expatiating on the excellence of water  He undertook to ring the changes once more in its praise  not like a hireling pleader  but as an enthusiast in the cause  A thousand times  exclaimed he  a thousand and a thousand times of greater value  as being more innocent than our modern taverns  were those baths of ages past  whither the people went not shamefully to squander their fortunes and expose their lives  by swilling themselves with wine  but assembled there for the decent and economical amusement of drinking warm water  It is difficult enough to admire the patriotic forecast of those ancient politicians  who established places of public resort  where water was dealt out gratis to all comers  and who confined wine to the shops of the apothecaries  that its use might be prohibited but under the direction of physicians  What a stroke of wisdom  It is doubtless to preserve the seeds of that antique frugality  emblematic of the golden age  that persons are found to this day  like you and me  who drink nothing but water  and are persuaded they possess a prevention or a cure for every ailment  provided our warm water has never boiled  for I have observed that water  when it has boiled  is heavier  and sits less easily on the stomach   While he was holding forth thus eloquently  I was in danger more than once of splitting my sides with laughing  But I contrived to keep my countenance  nay
