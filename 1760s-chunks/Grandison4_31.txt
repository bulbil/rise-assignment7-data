in which you will dispose of the notes  And from Mr  O Hara s behaviour upon it  we shall observe whether he is a man with whom your mother  if it be not her own fault  now you have made it their interest to be kind to each other  may live well  But the motion be all your own   How good this was  I could have kissed the hand that gave me the notes  if I thought it would not have looked too free   I understand you  Sir  said I     77 And when they went away  pouring out their very hearts in grateful joy  I addressed myself to Mr  O Hara  Sir  said I  it is proper that the payment of the additional annuity should have a commencement  Let it be from Christmas last  Accept of the first payment from my own hands—And I gave him one 25l  note  And looking at my mother  with a look of duty  for fear he should mistake  and discredit himself in the eyes of the deepest discerner in the world  gave him the other   He looked upon first one then upon the other note with surprize—And then bowing to the ground to me  and to my guardian  he stept to my mother  and presented them both to her  You  madam  said he  must speak  I cannot as I ought  God send me with a whole heart out of this house  He hurried out  and when he was in the hall  wiped his eyes  and sobbed like a child  as one of the servants told my Anne   My mother looked upon one note as her husband had done  and upon the other  and  lifting up her eyes  embraced me—And would have said something to my guardian  but he prevented her by saying—Emily will be always dutiful to you  madam  and respectful to Mr  O Hara  May you be happy together   And he led her out—Was ever such a condescension  He led her out to her husband  who  being a little recovered  was just about to give some money to the servant  who was retiring from the offer—Nobody  said my guardian  graciously smiling  pays my servants but myself  Mr  O Hara  They are good people  and merit my favour   And he went to the very door with my mother  I could not  I ran back  crying for joy  into the drawing room  when they went out of it  I could not bear myself  How could I  you know  madam —Captain Salmonet all the time wiped his eyes  shrugged his shoulders  lifted up his hands  and cried out upon Jesu  and once or twice he crossed himself  But all   78 the time my guardian looked and acted  as if those actions and praises were nothing to be proud of   When he came in to me  I arose  and threw myself at his feet  but could only say  Thank you  Sir  for your goodness to my mother  He raised me  He sat down by me  See  child  said he  and he took my hand  My heart was sensible of the favour  and throbbed with joy  what it is in the power of people of fortune to do  You have a great one  Now your mother is married  I have hopes of her  They will at least keep up appearances to each other  and to the world  They neither of them want sense  You have done an act of duty and benevolence both in one  The man who would grudge them this additional 200l  a year out of your fortune  to make your parent happy  shall not have my Emily—Shall he   Your Emily  your happy Emily  Sir  has not  cannot have a heart that is worth notice  if it be not implicitly guided by you —This I said  madam  and it is true   And did he  not said I  clasp his Emily to his generous bosom  when you said so   No  madam  that would have been too great an honour  But he called me  Good child  And said  you shall never be put to pay me an implicit regard  Your own reason  and he called me child again  shall always be the judge of my conduct to you  and direct your observances of my advice  Something like this he said  but in a better manner than I can say it   He calls me oftner child  madam  than any thing else when we are alone together  and is not quite so free  I think  at such times  in his behaviour to me  yet is vastly gracious I don t know how  as when we are in company—Why is that  I am sure  I equally respect him  at one time as at another—Do you think  madam  there is any thing in the observation  Is there any reason for it —I do love to study him  and to find out the meaning of his very looks as well as words    79 Sir Charles Grandison s heart is the book of heaven—May I not study it
