he and one of the under clerks are sworn brothers  and that under clerk has a good deal to say with one of the upper clerks  who is very well known to the under secretary  who  upon his recommendation  I hope will recommend my affair to the first secretary  and he again  will speak to one of the Lords in my behalf  So that you see  I do not want friends to assist me on occasion —As for the fellowr Crampley  tho s I know him not  I am sure he is neither sea man nor officer  by what you have told me  or else he could never be so much mistaken in his reckoning    46 as to run the ship on shore on the coast of Sussex  before he believed himself in soundings  neither  when that accident happened  would he have left the ship until she had been stove to pieces  especially when the tide was making  wherefore  by this time  I do suppose he has been tried by a court martial and executed for his cowardice and misconduct  —  I could not help smiling at the description of my uncle s ladder  by which he proposed to clime to the attention of the board of admiralty  and tho  I knew the world too well  to confide in such dependance myself  I would not discourage him with doubts  but asked if he had no friend in London  who would advance a small sum of money to enable him to appear as he ought  and make a small present to the under secretary  who might possibly dispatch his business the sooner on that account —He scratched his head  and after some recollection  replied    Why  yes  I believe Daniel Whipcord the ship chandler in Wapping would not refuse me such a small matter —I know I can have what credit I would  for lodging  liquor and cloaths  but as to money  I won t be positive —Had honest Block been living  I should not have been at a loss  —  I was heartily sorry to find a worthy man so destitute of friends  when he had such need of them  and looked upon my own situation as less miserable than his  because I was better acquainted with the selfishness and roguery of mankind  consequently less liable to disappointment and imposition       47  CHAP  XLII    He takes his passage in a Cutter for Deal—we are accosted by a priest  who proves to be a Scottishman—his professions of friendship—he is affronted by the lieutenant  who afterwards appeases him by submission—my uncle embarks—I am introduced by the priest to a capuchin  in whose company I set out for Paris—the character of my fellow traveller—an adventure on the road—I am shocked at his behaviour   WHEN our repast was ended  we walked down to the harbour  where we found a Cutter that was to sail for Deal in the evening  and Mr  Bowling agreed for his passage  In the mean time  we sauntered about the town  to satisfy our curiosity  our conversation turning on the subject of my designs  which were not as yet fixed  Neither can it be supposed  that my mind was at ease  when I found myself reduced almost to extreme poverty  in the midst of foreigners  among whom I had not one acquaintance to advise or befriend me —My uncle was sensible of my forlorn condition  and pressed me to accompany him to England  where he did not doubt of finding some sort of provision for me  But besides the other reasons I had for avoiding that kingdom  I looked upon it  at this time  as   48 the worst country in the universe for a poor honest man to live in  and therefore determined to remain in France  coute que coute —I was confirmed in this resolution  by a reverend priest  who passing by at this time  and overhearing us speak English  accosted us in the same language  telling us he was our countryman  and wishing it might be in his power to do us any service  We thanked this grave person for his courteous offer  and invited him to drink a glass with us  which he did not think proper to refuse  and we went all together into a tavern of his recommending  After having drank to our healths in a bumper of good Burgundy  he began to enquire into our situation  and asked particularly the place of our nativity  which we no sooner named  than he started up  and wringing our hands with great fervour  shed a flood of tears  crying     I come from the same part of the country  perhaps you are my own relations  —  I was on my guard against his caresses  which I suspected very much  when I remembred the adventure of the money dropper  but without any appearance of diffidence  observed  that as he was born in that part of the country  he must certainly know our families  which  howsoever mean our present appearance might be  were none of the most obscure and inconsiderable —Then I discovered our names  to which I found he was no stranger  he had known my grandfather personally  and notwithstanding an absence of fifty years from Scotland  recounted so many particulars of the
