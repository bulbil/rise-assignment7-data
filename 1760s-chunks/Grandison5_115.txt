him  Attention —Compassion you might as well have said—I hope not  And I am obliged to Mr  Beauchamp for his inference  from the chearfulness  that nothing lay upon my mind  Now  tho  that inference seemed to imply  that he thought  if he had not made the observation  something might have been supposed to lie upon my mind  I am much better satisfied that he made it  than if Sir Charles had   Upon the whole  I cannot but be pleased at two things in your Letter  The one  that Sir Charles expressed so great a concern for my health  The other  that you have all promised  and that voluntarily  and from a sense of the fitness of the measure  that everything be left to its natural course—For my sake  and for goodness sake  pray let it be so  I think the opening  as you call it  was much  very much  too warm  Bless me  my dear  how I trembled as I read that part —I am not  methinks  quite satisfied with it  tho  I am with your intention   Consider  my dear  Half a heart—A preferred Lady —For quality  fortune  and every merit  so greatly preferable—O my Charlotte  I cannot  were the best to happen that can now happen  take such exceeding joy  as I once could have done  in the prospect of that best —I have pride—But let us hear what the next Letters from Italy say  and it will be then time enough  if the truly admirable Lady shall adhere to her resolution  to come with my scruples and drawbacks  Your aunt Grandison is of opinion  that she will not adhere  Who can tell what to say  Imagination  unnaturally Page  287 heightened  may change into one altitude from another  I myself sincerely think  and have so often said it  that an uncharitable mind would perhaps charge me with affectation for it  that Lady Clementina  and no other woman  can deserve Sir Charles Grandison   Adieu  my dear  Pray tell your brother that I never thought myself so ill as your friendly love made you apprehend me to be  And that I congratulate you with all my heart  and him also  it would be an affectation to forbear it  which would imply too much  on his safe arrival in England  But be sure remember  that I look upon you and your Lord  upon my Lord and Lady L  and upon my sweet Emily  if she sees what I write  as guardians of the honour  of the punctilio  if you please  since no dis honour can be apprehended from Sir Charles Grandison  of  Your and Their HARRIET BYRON   LETTER XLV  Dr  BARTLETT  To Lady G    Monday  Sept  11   IN obedience to your Ladyship s commands  I write  but it must be briefly  an account of our motions   Sir Charles would not go out of town  till he had made a visit to Mr  and Mrs  Reeves  and enquired after Miss Byron s health  of which he received an account less alarming  than we  from our love and our fears  had given him   We arrived at Windsor on Wednesday evening  My Lord and Lady W  expected him not till the next day   I cannot find words to express the joy with which they received him  My Lord acknowleged  before us all  that he owed it to God  and to him  that he was the happiest man in the world  My Lady called herself  Page  288 with tears of joy  a happy woman  And Sir Charles told me  that when he was led by her to her closet  to talk about the affairs of her family  she exceedingly abashed him  by expressing her gratitude to him for his goodness to them all  on her knees  while he was almost ready  on his  he said  to acknowlege the aunt  that had done so much honour to his recommendation  and made his uncle so happy   Sir Charles  in order to have leave to depart next morning  as soon as he had breakfasted  promised to pass several days with them  when he could think himself a settled Englishman   You  madam  and Lady L  equally love and admire Lady W   I will not  therefore  enlarge to you on her excellencies  Every body loves her  Her servants  as they attend  look at their Lady  with the same delight  mingled with reverence  as those of my patron look upon him   Poor Mr  Grandison could not help taking notice to me  with tears  on the joint acknowlegements of my Lord and Lady made to my patron  that goodness and beneficence brought with them their own rewards  Saw you not  my good Dr  Bartlett  said he  how my cousin s eyes glistened with modest joy  as my Lord and Lady ran over with their gratitude  I thought of him  as an angel among men—What a wretch have I been  How can I sit at table with him  Yet how he overwhelms me with his goodness   My patron having
