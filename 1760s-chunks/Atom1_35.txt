of sorcery  turning the sieve and sheers  mumbling gibberish over a goose s liver stuck with pins  pricking your thumbs  and writing mystical characters with your blood  forming spells with sticks laid across  reading prayers backwards  and invoking the devil by the name  style  and title of Sathan  Abrasax Adonai  I know what communication you had with goody Thrusk at Camberwell  who undertook for three shillings and four pence to convey you on a broomstick to Norway  where the devil was to hold a conventicle  but you boggled at crossing the sea  without such security for your person as the beldame could not give  I remember your poring over the treatise De volucri arborea  until you had well nigh lost your wits  and your intention to enrol yourself in the Rosicrusian society  until your intrigue    196 with the tripe woman in Thieving lane destroyed your pretensions to chastity  Then you cloaked your own wickedness with an affectation of scepticism  and declared there never was any such existence as devil  demon  spirit  or goblin  nor any such art as magic  necromancy  sorcery  or witchcraft —O infidel  hast thou never heard of the three divisions of magic into natural  artificial  and diabolical  The first of these is no more than medicine  hence the same word Pharmacopola signified both a wise acre and apothecary  To the second belong the glass sphere of Archimedes  the flying wooden pigeon of Archytus  the emperor Leo s singing birds of gold  Boetius the Consolator s flying birds of brass  hissing serpents of the same metal  and the famous speaking head of Albertus Magnus  The last  which we call diabolical  depends upon the    197 evocation of spirits  such was the art exercised by the magicians of Pharaoh  as well as by that conjurer recorded by Gaspar Peucerus  who animated the dead carcase of a famous female harper in Bologna in such a manner  that she played upon her instrument as well as ever she had done in her life  until another magician removing the charm  which had been placed in her arm pits  the body fell down deprived of all motion  It is by such means that conjurers cure distempers with charms and amulets  that  according to St  Isidore  they confound the elements  disturb the understanding  slay without poison or any perceptible wound  call up devils  and learn from them how to torment their enemies  Magic was known even to the ancient Romans  Cato teaches us how to charm a dislocated bone  by repeating these mystical words  Incipe    198cantare in alto  S  F  motas danata dardaries  Astotaries  dic una parite dum coeunt   c  Besides  the virtues of ABRACADABRA are well known  though the meaning of the word has puzzled some of the best critics of the last age  such as Wendelinus  Scaliger  Saumaise  and father Kircher  not to mention the ancient physician Serenus Sammonicus  who describes the disposition of these characters in hexameter verse  I might here launch out into a very learned dissertation to prove that this very Serenus formed the word ABRACADABRA from the Greek word 〈 in non Latin alphabet 〉  a name by which Basilides the Aegyptian heretic defined the Deity  as the letters of it imply 365  the number of days in the year  This is the word still fair and legible on one of the two talismans found in the seventeenth century  of which Baronius gives us the    199 figure in the second volume of his Annals  By the bye  Peacock  you must take notice  that the figure of St  George encountering the dragon  which is the symbol of the order of the Garter  and at this day distinguishes so many inns  taverns  and ale houses  in this kingdom  was no other originally than the device of an abraxas or amulet wore by the Basilidians  as a charm against infection  for  by the man on horseback killing the dragon  was typified the sun purifying the air  and dispersing the noxious vapours from the earth  An abraxas marked with this device  is exhibited by Montfaucon out of the Collection of Sig  Capello  This symbol  improved by the cross on the top of the spear  was afterwards adopted by the Christian crusards  as a badge of their religious warfare  as well as an amulet to ensure victory  the cross alluding to Constantine s    200 labarum  with the motto 〈 in non Latin alphabet 〉    In this you shall conquer    The figure on horseback they metamorphosed into St  George  the same with George the Arian  who at one time was reckoned a martyr  and maintained a place in the Roman Martyrology  from which he and others were erased by pope Gelasius in the fifth century  because the accounts of their martyrdom were written by heretics  This very George  while he officiated as bishop of Alexandria  having ordered a temple of the god Mythras to be purified  and converted into a Christian church  found in the said temple this emblem of the sun  which the Persians adored under the name of Mythras  and with the addition of the cross  metamorphosed it into a symbol of Christian warfare against idolatry  It was on this occasion that
