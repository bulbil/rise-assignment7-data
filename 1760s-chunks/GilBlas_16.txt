apologetic a bow  beseeching me with so submissive a grimace not to be offended at his curiosity  that I was drawn in to gratify it whether I would or no  Thus by degrees did we get into a long conversation  in the course of which I took occasion to hint that I had some reasons for wishing to get rid of my mule  and travel under convoy of a muleteer  He seemed on the whole to approve of my plan  though he could not prevail with himself to tell me so briefly  for he introduced his remarks by descanting on all the possible and probable mischances to which travellers are liable on the road  not omitting an awkward story now and then  I thought the fellow would never have done  But the conclusion of the argument was  that if I wanted to sell my mule  he knew an honest jockey who would take it off my hands  I begged he would do me the favour to fetch him  which was no sooner said than done   On his return he introduced the purchaser  with a high encomium on his integrity  We all three went into the yard  and the mule was brought out to show paces before the jockey  who set himself to examine the beast from head to foot  His report was bad enough  To be sure  it would not have been easy to make a good one  but if it had been the pope s mule  and this fellow was to cheapen the bargain  it would have been just the same  nay  to speak with all due reverence  if he had been asked to give an opinion of the pope s great toe  from that disparaging habit of his  he would have pronounced it no better than the toe of any ordinary man  He laid it down  therefore  as a principle  that the mule had all the defects a mule could have  appealing to the landlord for a confirmation of his judgment  who  doubtless  had reasons of his own for not controverting his friend s assertion  Well  says the jockey  with an air of in difference  What price have you the conscience to ask for this devil of an animal  After such a panegyric  and master Corcuelo s certificate  whom I was fool enough to take for a fair dealing man and a good judge of horse flesh  they might have had the mule for nothing  I therefore told the dealer that I threw myself on his mercy  he must fix his own sum  and I should expect no more  On this he began to affect the gentleman  and answered that I had found out his weak side when I left it to his honour  He was right enough in that  his honour was his weak side  for instead of bidding up to my uncle s estimate of ten or twelve pistoles  the rascal had the impudence to offer three ducats  which I accepted with as light a heart as if I had got the best of the bargain   Having disencumbered myself of my mule in so tradesmanlike a manner  I went with my landlord to a carrier who was to set out early the next morning for Astorga  and engaged to call me up in time  When we had settled the hire of the mule  as well as the expenses on the road  I turned back towards the inn with Corcuelo  who  as we went along  got into the private history of this muleteer  When I had been pestered with all the tittle  tattle of the town about this fellow  the changes were just beginning to ring on some new subject  but  by good luck  a pretty looking sort of a man very civilly interrupted my loquacious friend  I left them together  and sauntered on without the slightest suspicion of being at all concerned in their discourse   I ordered supper as soon as I got to the inn  It was a fish day  but I thought eggs were better suited to my finances  While they were getting ready I joined in conversation with the landlady  whom I had not seen before  She seemed a pretty piece of goods enough  and such a stirring body  that I should have concluded  if her husband had not told me so  her tavern must have plenty of custom  The moment the omelet was served up I sat down to table by myself  and had scarcely got the relish of it  when my landlord walked in  followed by the man who had stopped him in the street  This pleasant gentleman wore a long rapier  and might  perhaps  be about thirty years of age  He came up to me in the most friendly manner possible  Mr Professor  says he  I have just now heard that you are the renowned Gil Blas of Santillane  that ornament of Oviedo and luminary of philosophy  And do my eyes behold that very greatest of all great scholars and wits  whose reputation has run hither so fast before him  Little do you think  continues he  directing his discourse to the landlord and landlady  little do you imagine  I say  what good luck has befallen you  Why  you have got hold of a treasure  In this young gentleman you behold the eighth wonder of the world  Then running
