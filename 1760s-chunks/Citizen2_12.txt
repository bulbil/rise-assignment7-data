reward virtue   Considering the little encouragement given to matrimony here  I am not surprized at the discouragements given to propagation  Would you believe it  my dear Fam Hoam  there are laws made  which even forbid the peoples marrying each other  By the head of Confucius I jest not    32 there are such laws in being here  and yet their law givers have neither been instructed among the Hottentot•  nor imbibed their principles of equity from the natives of Anamaboo   There are laws which ordain  that no man shall marry a woman against her own consent  This  though contrary to what we are taught in Asia  and though in some measure a clog upon matrimony  I have no great objection to  There are laws which ordain  that no woman shall marry against her father and mother s consent  unless arrived at an age of maturity  by which is understood those years  when women with us are generally past child bearing  This must be a clog upon matrimony  as it is more difficult for the lover to please three than one  and much more difficult to please old people than young ones  The laws ordain  that the consenting couple shall take a long time to consider before they marry  this is a very great clog  because people love to have all rash actions done in a hurry  It is ordained  that all marriages shall be proclaimed before celebration  this is a severe clog  as many are ashamed to have their marriage made public  from motives of vicious modesty  and many afraid from views of temporal interest  It is ordained  that there is nothing sacred in the ceremony  but that it may be dissolved to all intents and purposes by the authority of any civil magistrate  And yet opposite to this it is ordained  that the priest shall be paid a large sum of money for granting his sacred permission   Thus you see  my friend  that matrimony here is hedged round with so many obstructions  that   33 those who are willing to break through or surmount them must be contented  if at last they find it a bed of thorns  The laws are not to blame  for they have deterred the people from engaging as much as they could  It is indeed become a very serious affair in England  and none but serious people are generally found willing to engage  The young  the gay  and the beautiful  who have motives of passion only to induce them  are seldom found to embark  as those inducements are taken away  and none but the old  the ugly  and the mercenary are seen to unite  who  if they have any posterity at all  will probably be an ill favoured race like themselves   What gave rise to those laws might have been some such accidents as these  It sometimes happened  that a miser who had spent all his youth  in scraping up money to give his daughter such a fortune as might get her a mandarin husband  found his expectations disappointed at last  by her running away with his footman  this must have been a sad shock to the poor disconsolate parent  to see his poor daughter in a one horse chaise  when he had designed her for a coach and six  what a stroke from Providence  to see his dear money go to enrich a beggar  all nature cried out at the profanation   It sometimes happened also  that a lady who had inherited all the titles  and all the nervous complaints of nobility  thought sit to impair her dignity and mend her constitution  by marrying a farmer  this must have been a sad shock to her inconsolable relations  to see so fine a flower snatched from a flourishing family  and planted   34 in a dunghill  this was an absolute inversion of the first principles of things   In order therefore to prevent the great from being thus contaminated by vulgar alliances  the obstacles to matrimony have been so contrived  that the rich only can marry amongst the rich  and the poor  who would leave celibacy  must be content to encrease their poverty with a wife  Thus have their laws fairly inverted the inducements to matrimony  nature tells us  that beauty is the proper allurement of those who are rich  and money of those who are poor  but things here are so contrived  that the rich are invited to marry by that fortune which they do not want  and the poor have no inducement  but that beauty which they do not feel   An equal diffusion of riches through any country ever constitutes its happiness  Great wealth in the possession of one stagnates  and extreme poverty with another keeps him in unambitious indigence  but the moderately rich are generally active  not too far removed from poverty to fear its calamities  nor too near extreme wealth to slacken the nerve of labour  they remain still between both in a state of continual fluctuation  How impolitic therefore are those laws which promote the accumulation of wealth among the rich  more impolitic still in attempting to increase the depression on poverty   Bacon the English philosopher  compares money to manure  if gathered in heaps  says he  it does no good  on the contrary  it becomes offensive  but being spread  though
