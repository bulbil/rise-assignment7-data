into ruin  The barons  therefore  once more combined to destroy this favourite  who was  in reality  without a protector  they therefore banished him and his father out of the kingdom  with great threats  if ever he attempted to return  This indignity to the King seemed to rouse him from his former lethargy  the Queen also  a bold haughty woman  endeavoured to stimulate him to revenge  she had received an affront on a pilgrimage to Canterbury  in being denied admittance  by the governor  into the castle of Leeds  on the way  She therefore persuaded her weak consort  that the present conjuncture was very favourable for freeing himself from the power of the barons  and  that punishing the governor of Leeds would intimidate them so far  as to prevent any future opposition  Her advice was embraced with avidity  the King raised an army without opposition  he besieged the castle of Leeds  the governor was taken  and the Queen now had an opportunity of satiating her revenge  by beheading him   Success only seemed to push this weak Prince on to new violences  he besieged the castles of several other barons  and became master of them with equal ease  To complete his contempt for all former compacts  he recalled his young favourite  Spencer  once more from banishment  We   118 may easily  upon this occasion  perceive how much the barons were declined from that degree of power they possessed two or three reigns before  The Monarch  at present  that oppressed them  was voluptuous  ignorant  and a coward  in the general opinion of the people  yet  feeble as he was  the barons were scarce able to resist him  the power of the people was now grown truly formidable  and Edward had address enough to procure a part of them to second his pretensions  The King now  therefore  in the meridian of power  prosecuted the most rigorous measures  the Queen  cruel by nature  and Spencer  his favourite  actuated by revenge  stimulated him to numberless acts of cruelty  Among others who perished in the opposition  was Thomas  Earl of Lancaster  this nobleman had always been signalized for his valour among the confederate Lords  and was a peculiar opposer of the growing power of the family of the Spencers  he was taken fighting  at the head of a body of forces which he had  in vain  endeavoured to rally  He had no great hopes to expect any favour from judges who were his enemies  from personal motives  he was condemned to be quartered  as a traitor  but  from a regard to his station  the King changed his punishment to beheading  In this manner nine other Lords were executed at York  as a terror to the kingdom  but these terrors could not secure a Monarch  who was in himself contemptible  Whatever might have been the Earl of Lancaster s real character  his death left it uncertain  whether he acted with views to get himself created King  or was only the champion of public liberty  However that be  the people in general had his memory in great veneration  and considered him as a martyr  We may by this see   119 what side in this quarrel was espoused by the clergy  immediately after the Earl s death  miracles were said to be wrought at his tomb  and every pretended miracle of this kind was productive of a thousand enemies to the King   The favourite Spencer and his father still gave an unbounded scope to their revenge  not content with putting to death the heads of the opposite party  with depriving others of their estates  and with condemning great numbers to perpetual banishment  they were resolved to level their rage against Roger Mortimer  now actually in their custody  and confined within the Tower  There were few circumstances that could apparently screen him from their resentment  he had been openly in arms  and active in the opposition  he had no character to render his punishment unpopular  and none that he knew to intercede for him with the King  yet he found his punishment remitted  to his astonishment  notwithstanding all the sollicitations of his enemies to the contrary  The Queen was fallen in love with this youth  and used all her interest to procure his pardon  an intimacy had actually commenced between them  and this protection  with which he was publicly honoured by her  drew down the resentment of the two favourites  In this opposition of interests  Edward seemed entirely passive  he wished to oblige both parties  and one day gave orders to screen young Mortimer from pursuit  and the next  to secure him wherever he could be detected  the feeble King knew not how to refuse any request  when he loved those who made the demand   A dissension thus between two parties  who shared the affections of the King  must soon terminate in the dismission of either  To get the   120 Queen removed  the Spencers contrived to persuade her to go upon a certain negotiation to the court of her brother  the King of France  With this proposal  tho  from her enemies  the Queen readily complied  she foresaw it would give her an uncontrouled liberty of enjoying the company of her gallant  and might give
