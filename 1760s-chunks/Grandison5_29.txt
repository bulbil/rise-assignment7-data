 that women in their advanced years may  to express myself in the stile of Sir Rowland Meredith  be good for something  or still better  that the matronly time of female life  is by far the most estimable of all the stages of it  if they make good wives  good mistresses  and good mothers  And  let me say  good aunts  were it but to keep in countenance aunt Gertrude and aunt Nell  who  good souls  will now hardly ever be mothers   Page  72 Lucy is an excellent young creature  Nancy  when Lucy is not present  is as excellent  Her cousins Kitty and Patty Holles are agreeable young women   James Selby is a good sort of blundering well meaning great boy  who  when he has lived a few years longer  may make much such a good sort of man  as my Lord G  There s for you  my once catechizing sister  Pray be as ready to praise  as you used to be to blame me  I find duty and love growing fast upon me  I shall get into a custom of bringing in Lord G  on every occasion that will do him credit  And then I shall be like Lady Betty Clemson  who is so perpetually dinning the ears of her guests with her domestic superlatives  that we are apt to suspect the truth of all she says   But Harriet  our dear Harriet is not at all well  She visibly falls away  and her fine complexion fades  Mr  Deane was here a week ago  and Lucy tells me  was so much startled at the alteration in her lovely countenance  that he broke from her  and shed tears to Lucy  This good girl and Nancy lament to each other the too visible change  But when they are with the rest of the family  they all seem afraid to take notice of it to one another  She herself takes generous pains to be lively  chearful  and unapprehensive  for fear of giving concern to her grandmother and aunt  who will sometimes sit and contemplate the alteration  sigh  and  now and then  drop a silent tear  which  however  they endeavour to smile off  to avoid notice  I have already observed  that as these good Ladies sit in her company  they watch in silent love every turn of her mild and patient eye  every change of her charming countenance  for they too well know to what to impute the inward malady  which has approached the best of hearts  and they know that the cure cannot be within the art of the physician  They  as we do  admire her voice  and her playing  They ask her for a song  for a lesson on her harpsichord  Page  73 She plays  she sings  at the very first word  In no one act of chearfulness does she refuse to join  Her grandmother and her aunt Selby frequently give a private ball  The old Lady delights to see young people chearful and happy  She is always present and directs the diversion  for she has a fine taste  We are often to have these Balls  for our entertainment  Miss Byron  her cousins say  knowing the delight her grandmother takes in these amusements  for the sake of the young people  to whom she considers it as a healthful exercise  as well as diversion  is one of the alertest in them  She excuses not herself  nor encourages that supeinness that creeps on  and invades a heart ill at ease  Yet every one sees  that solitude and retirement are her choice  tho  she is very careful to have it supposed otherwise  and  on the first summons  hastens into company  and joins in the conversation  O she is a lovely  and beloved young creature  I think verily  that tho  she was the admiration of every body  when she was with us  yet she is  if possible  more amiable at home  and among her own relations  Her uncle Selby raillies her sometimes  But respect  as well as love  are visible in his countenance  when he does  In her returns sweetness and reverence are mingled  She never forgets that the raillier is her uncle  yet her delicacy is not more apparent  than that she is mistress of fine talents in that way  but often restrains them  because she has far more superior ones to value herself upon  And is not this the case with my brother also —Not so  I am afraid  with your Charlotte   All her friends  however  rejoice in our visit to them  for her sake  They compliment me on my lively turn  and hope for a happy effect on Miss Byron from it   I cannot accuse her of reserve to me  She owns her Love for our brother as frankly as she used to do  after we had torn the secret from her bosom at Colnebrooke  Page  74 She acknowleges to me  that she glories in it  and will not try to conquer it  because she is sure the trial will be to no purpose  an excuse  by the way  that if the conquest be necessary  would better become the mouth of your Charlotte than that of
