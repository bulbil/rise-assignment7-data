still alive among them who has more than once deserved the most ignominious severity of justice  His being of the blood royal  however  was thought a sufficient attonement for his being a disgrace to humanity  This remarkable personage took pleasure in shooting at the passengers below  from the top of his palace  and in this most princely amusement he usually spent some time every day  He was at length arraigned by the friends of a person whom in this manner he had killed  was found guilty of the charge  and condemned to die  His merciful monarch pardoned him in consideration   163 of his rank and quality  The unrepenting criminal soon after renewed his usual entertainment  and in the same manner killed another man  He was a second time condemned  and strange to think  a second time received his majesty s pardon  Would you believe it  A third time the very same man was guilty of the very same offence  a third time therefore the laws of his country found him guilty—I wish for the honour of humanity I could suppress the rest —A third time he was pardoned  Will you not think such a story too extraordinary for belief  will you not think me describing the savage inhabitants of Congo  alas  the story is but too true  and the country where it was transacted  regards itself as the politest in Europe  Adieu   LETTER XXXVIII  From Lien Chi Altangi to      Merchant in Amsterdam   CEremonies are different in every country  but true politeness is every where the same  Ceremonies  which take up so much of our attention  are only artificial helps which ignorance assumes  in order to imitate politeness  which is the result of good sense and good nature  A person possessed of those qualities  though he had never seen a court  is truly agreeable  and if without them  would continue a clown  though he had been all his life a gentleman usher     164How would a Chinese  bred up in the formalities of an eastern court  be regarded  should he carry all his good manners beyond the Great Wall  How would an Englishman  skilled in all the decorums of western good breeding  appear at an eastern entertainment  Would he not be reckoned more fantastically savage than even his unbred footman   Ceremony resembles that base coin which circulates through a country by the royal mandate  it serves every purpose of real money at home  but is entirely useless if carried abroad  a person who should attempt to circulate his native trash in another country  would be thought either ridiculous or culpable  He is truly well bred who knows when to value and when to despise those national peculiarities which are regarded by some with so much observance  a traveller of taste at once perceives that the wise are polite all the world over  but that fools are polite only at home   I have now before me two very fashionable letters upon the same subject  both written by ladies of distinction  one of whom leads the fashion in England  and the other sets the ceremonies of China  they are both regarded in their respective countries by all the beau monde  as standards of taste  and models of true politeness  and both give us a true idea of what they imagine elegant in their admirers  which of them understands true politeness or whether either  you shall be at liberty to determine  the English lady writes thus to her female confidant     165  AS I live  my dear Charlotte  I believe the colonel will carry it at last  he is a most irresistable fellow  that s flat  So well dress•d  so neat  so sprightly  and plays about one so agreeably  that I vow  he has as much spirits as the marquis of Monkeyman s Italian greyhound  I I first saw him at Renelagh  he shines there  he s nothing without Renelagh  and Renelagh nothing without him  The next day he sent a card  and compliments  desiring to wait on mamma and me to the music subscription  He looked all the time with such irresistable impudence  that positively he had something in his face gave me as much pleasure as a pair royal of naturals in my own hand  He waited on mamma and me the next morning to know how we got home  you must know the insidious devil makes love to us both  Rap went the footman at the door  bounce went my heart  I thought he would have rattled the house down  Chariot drove up to the window  with his footmen in the prettiest liveries  he has infinite taste  that s flat  Mamma had spent all the morning at her head  but for my part  I was in an undress to receive him  quite easy  mind that  no way disturbed at his approach  mamma pretended to be as degagee as I  and yet I saw her blush in spite of her  Positively he is a most killing devil  We did nothing but laugh all the time he staid with us  I never heard so many very good things before  at first he mistook mamma for my sister  at which she laughed  then he mistook my natural complection for paint  at which I laugh d  and then he shewed
