 and a desperate engagement in all  probability would have ensued  had not the lady of the castle  interposed  and prevented the effects of their animosity  by assuring  the lieutenant that the commodore had been the aggressor  and that the  workmen  finding themselves attacked in such an extraordinary manner   by a person whom they did not know  were obliged to act in their own  defence  by which he had received that unlucky contusion   Mr  Hatchway no sooner learnt the sentiments of Mrs  Trunnion  than   sheathing his indignation  he told the commodore he should always  be ready to execute his lawful commands  but that he could not in  conscience be concerned in oppressing poor people who had been guilty of  no offence   This unexpected declaration  together with the behaviour of his wife   who in his hearing desired the carpenters to resume their work  filled  the breast of Trunnion with rage and mortification  He pulled off his  woollen night cap  pummeled his bare pate  beat the floor alternately  with his feet  swore his people had betrayed him  and cursed himself to  the lowest pit of hell for having admitted such a cockatrice into his  family  But all these exclamations did not avail  they were among the  last essays of his resistance to the will of his wife  whose influence  among his adherents had already swallowed up his own  and peremptorily  told him that he must leave the management of everything within doors to  her  who understood best what was for his honour and advantage  She then  ordered a poultice to be prepared for his eye  which being applied  he  was committed to the care of Pipes  by whom he was led about the house  like a blind bear growling for prey  while his industrious yoke fellow  executed every circumstance of the plan she had projected  so that when  he recovered his vision he was an utter stranger in his own house   CHAPTER X    The Commodore being in some cases restive  his Lady has recourse to  Artifice in the Establishment of her Throne  She exhibits Symptoms of  Pregnancy  to the unspeakable joy of Trunnion  who  nevertheless  is  balked in his expectation   These innovations were not effected without many loud objections on  his part  and divers curious dialogues passed between him and his  yoke fellow  who always came off victorious from the dispute  insomuch     6 22 15  3 45 PM   that his countenance gradually fell  he began to suppress  and at length  entirely devoured  his chagrin  the terrors of superior authority were  plainly perceivable in his features  and in less than three months  he became a thorough paced husband  Not that his obstinacy was  extinguished  though overcome  In some things he was as inflexible and  mulish as ever  but then he durst not kick so openly  and was reduced  to the necessity of being passive in his resentments  Mrs  Trunnion  for  example  proposed that a coach and six should be purchased  as she could  not ride on horseback  and the chaise was a scandalous carriage for a  person of her condition  The commodore  conscious of his own inferior  capacity in point of reasoning  did not think proper to dispute the  proposal but lent a deaf ear to her repeated remonstrances  though  they were enforced with every argument which she thought could soothe   terrify  shame or decoy him into compliance  In vain did she urge  the excess of affection she had for him as meriting some return of  tenderness and condescension  he was even proof against certain menacing  hints she gave touching the resentment of a slighted woman  and he stood  out against all the considerations of dignity or disgrace like a bulwark  of brass  Neither was he moved to any indecent or unkind expressions of  contradiction  even when she upbraided him with his sordid disposition   and put him in mind of the fortune and honour he had acquired by his  marriage  but seemed to retire within himself  like a tortoise when  attacked  that shrinks within its shell  and silently endured the  scourge of her reproaches  without seeming sensible of the smart   This  however  was the only point in which she had been baffled since  her nuptials  and as she could by no means digest the miscarriage  she  tortured her invention for some new plan by which she might augment  her influence and authority  What her genius refused was supplied by  accident  for she had not lived four months in the garrison  when  she was seized with frequent qualms and retchings  in a word  she  congratulated herself on the symptoms of her own fertility  and the  commodore was transported with joy at the prospect of an heir of his own  begetting   She knew this was the proper season for vindicating her own sovereignty   and accordingly employed the means which nature had put in her power   There was not a rare piece of furniture or apparel for which she did not  long  and one day  as she went to church
