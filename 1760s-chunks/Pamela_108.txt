all human means fail  God Almighty would not lay me under   these sore afflictions  if he had not given me strength to grapple with   them  if I will exert it as I ought  And who knows  but that the very   presence I so much dread of my angry and designing master   for he has   had me in his power before  and yet I have escaped   may be better for   me  than these persecuting emissaries of his  who  for his money  are   true to their wicked trust  and are hardened by that  and a long habit   of wickedness  against compunction of heart  God can touch his heart in   an instant  and if this should not be done  I can then but put an end to   my life by some other means  if I am so resolved       But how do I know  thought I  that even these bruises and maims that I   have gotten  while I pursued only the laudable escape I had meditated    may not kindly have furnished me with the opportunity I am now tempted   with to precipitate myself  and of surrendering up my life  spotless and   unguilty  to that merciful Being who gave it       Then  thought I  who gave thee  presumptuous as thou art  a power over   thy life  Who authorised thee to put an end to it  when the weakness   of thy mind suggests not to thee a way to preserve it with honour  How   knowest thou what purposes God may have to serve  by the trials with   which thou art now exercised  Art thou to put a bound to the divine   will  and to say  Thus much will I bear  and no more  And wilt thou dare   to say  That if the trial be augmented and continued  thou wilt sooner   die than bear it       This act of despondency  thought I  is a sin  that  if I pursue it    admits of no repentance  and can therefore hope no forgiveness   And   wilt thou  to shorten thy transitory griefs  heavy as they are  and weak   as thou fanciest thyself  plunge both body and soul into everlasting   misery  Hitherto  Pamela  thought I  thou art the innocent  the   suffering Pamela  and wilt thou  to avoid thy sufferings  be the guilty   aggressor  And  because wicked men persecute thee  wilt thou fly in the   face of the Almighty  and distrust his grace and goodness  who can still   turn all these sufferings to benefits  And how do I know  but that God    who sees all the lurking vileness of my heart  may have permitted these   sufferings on that very score  and to make me rely solely on his grace   and assistance  who  perhaps  have too much prided myself in a vain   dependence on my own foolish contrivances       Then  again  thought I  wilt thou suffer in one moment all the good   lessons of thy poor honest parents  and the benefit of their example     who have persisted in doing their duty with resignation to the divine   will  amidst the extreme degrees of disappointment  poverty  and   distress  and the persecutions of an ungrateful world  and merciless   creditors   to be thrown away upon thee  and bring down  as in all   probability this thy rashness will  their grey hairs with sorrow to   the grave  when they shall understand  that their beloved daughter    slighting the tenders of divine grace  despairing of the mercies of a   protecting God  has blemished  in this last act  a whole life  which   they had hitherto approved and delighted in       What then  presumptuous Pamela  dost thou here  thought I  Quit with   speed these perilous banks  and fly from these curling waters  that   seem  in their meaning murmurs  this still night  to reproach thy   rashness  Tempt not God s goodness on the mossy banks  that have been   witnesses of thy guilty purpose  and while thou hast power left thee    avoid the tempting evil  lest thy grand enemy  now repulsed by divine   grace  and due reflection  return to the assault with a force that thy   weakness may not be able to resist  and let one rash moment destroy all   the convictions  which now have awed thy rebellious mind into duty and   resignation to the divine will       And so saying  I arose  but was so stiff with my hurts  so cold with the   moist dew of the night  and the wet grass on which I had sat  as also   with the damps arising from so large a piece of water  that with great
