has some private reasons for not choosing to renew the acquaintance  I think we cannot do better than make our way back as fast as possible for Valencia  Let us not be in too great a hurry for that  sir  answered my secretary  you know better than myself  having served a long apprenticeship  that there is no getting on at court without patience and perseverance  Be indefatigable in exhibiting your person to the prince s regards  by dint of forcing yourself on his observation  you will oblige him to ask himself the question who this assiduous frequenter of his haunts can possibly be  when memory must come to his aid  and trace the features of his cheapener in the purchase of the lovely Catalina s good graces   That Scipio might have nothing to reproach me with  I so far lent myself to his wishes as to continue the same proceeding for the space of three weeks  when at length it happened one day that the monarch  noticing the frequency of my appearance  sent for me into his presence  I went into the closet  not without some perturbation of mind at the idea of a private interview with my sovereign  Who are you  said he  your features are not altogether strange to me  Where have I seen you  Please your majesty  answered I trembling  I had the honour of escorting you one night with the Count of Lemos to the house of         Ah  I recollect it perfectly  cried the prince  as if a sudden light had broke in upon him  you were the Duke of Lerma s secretary  and if I am not mistaken  your name is Santillane  I have not forgotten that on the occasion alluded to you served me with a most commendable zeal  but received a left handed recompense for your exertions  Did you not get into prison at the conclusion of the adventure  Yes  please your majesty  replied I  my confinement in the tower of Segovia lasted six months  but your goodness was exercised in procuring my release  That  replied he  does not cancel my debt to my faithful servant Santillane  it is not enough to have restored him to liberty  for I ought to make him ample amends for the evils which he has suffered on the score of his alacrity in my concerns   Just as the prince was uttering these words  the Count of Olivarez came into the closet  The nerves of favourites are shaken by every breath  their irritability excited by every trifle  he was as much astonished as any favourite need be at the sight of a stranger in that place  and the king redoubled his wondering propensities by the following recommendation    Count  I consign this young man to your care  employ him  and let me find that you provide for his advancement  The minister affected to receive this order with the most gracious acquiescence  but looked me over from head to foot  with a glance from the corner of his eye  and was on tenter hooks to find out who had been so strangely saddled upon him  Go  my friend  added the sovereign  addressing himself to me  and waving his hand for me to withdraw  the count will not fail to avail himself of your services in a manner the most conducive to the interests of my government  and the establishment of your own fortunes   I immediately went out of the closet and made the best of my way to the son of Coselina  who  being overrun with impatience to inquire what the king had been talking about  fumbled at his fingers  ends  and was all over in an agitation  His first question was  whether we were to return to Valencia or become a part of the court  You shall form your own conclusions  answered I  at the same time delighting him with an account word for word of the little conversation I had just held with the monarch  My dear master  said Scipio at once in the excess of his joy  will you take me for your almanac maker another time  You must acknowledge that we were not in the wrong  the lords of Leyva and myself have our eye teeth about us  a journey to Madrid was the only measure to be adopted in such a case  Already I anticipate your appointment to an eminent post  you will turn out to be some time or other a Calderona to the Count of Olivarez  That is by no means the object of my ambition  observed I in return  the employment is placed on too rugged an eminence to excite any longings in my mind  I could wish for a good situation where there could be no inducement to do what might go against my conscience  and where the favours of my prince are not likely to be bartered away for filthy lucre  Having experienced my own unfitness for the possession of patronage  I cannot be sufficiently on my guard against the inroads of avarice and ambition  Never think about that  sir  replied my secretary  the minister will give you some handsome appointment  which you may fill without any impeachment of your integrity or independence   Induced more by Scipio s importunity than my own curiosity  I repaired the following day before sunrise to the residence of the Count d
