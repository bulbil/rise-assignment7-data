our Harriet  And so I have told her   She prays for the restoration of Lady Clementina  and recovery of Signor Jeronymo  She loves to talk of the whole Italian family  and yet seems fully assured that Clementina will be the happy woman  But  surely  Harriet must be our sister  She values herself upon my brother s so solemnly requesting and claiming her friendship  True Friendship  she but this morning argued with me  being disinterested  and more intellectual than personal  is nobler than Love  Love  she said  does not always ripen into Friendship  as is too frequently seen in wedlock   But does not the dear creature refine too much when she argues thus  A calm and easy kind of esteem  is all I have to judge from in my matrimony  I know not what Love is  At the very highest  and when I was most a fool  my motive was supposed convenience  in order to be freed from the apprehended tyranny of a father   and that never carried me beyond liking  But you  Lady L  were an adept in the passion  Pray tell me  if there be a difference between Love and Friendship  which is the noblest  Upon my opposing you and Lord L   so truly one mind  to her argument  she said  That yours is Love mellowed into Friendship  upon full proof of the merit of each  But  that there was a time  that the flame was Love only  founded in hope of the merit  and the proof might have been wanting  as it often is  when the hope has been as strong  and seemingly as well founded as in your courtship   Harriet  possibly  may argue from her own situation  in order to make her heart easy  and my brother is so unquestionably worthy  that Love and Friendship Page  75 my be one thing  in the bosom of a woman admiring him  since he will not enter into any obligation  that he cannot  that he will not  religiously perform  And if this refinement will make her heart easier  and enable her to allow his Love to be placed elsewhere  because of a prior claim  and of circumstances that call for generous compassion  while she can content herself with the offered Friendship  I think we ought to indulge her in her delicate notions   Selby house is a large  convenient  well furnish d habitation  To morrow we are to make a visit  with Lucy and Nancy  to their branch of the Selby Family  James is gone before  Those two girls are orphans  But their grandmother  by their mother s side  a good old Lady  mother in law to Mr  Selby  lives with them  or  rather  they with her  and loves them   On our return  we are to have our first private Ball  at Shirley manor  a fine old seat  which  already  the benevolent owner calls her Harriet s  with an estate of about 500 l  a year round it   Adieu  my dear Lady L —My Lord and you  I hope  will own me now  Yet are you not sometimes surprised at the suddenness of my reformation  Shall I tell you how it came about  To own the truth  I began to find the man could be stout     Charlotte  thought I  what are you about  You mean not to continue for ever your playful folly  You have no malice  no wickedness  in your sauciness  only a little levity  It may grow into habit —Make your retreat while you can with honour  before you harden the man s heart  and find your reformation a matter of indifference to him  You have a few good qualities  are not a modern woman  have neither wings to your shoulders  nor gad fly in your cap  You love home  At present the honest man loves you  He has no vices  Every one loves you  but all your friends are busy upon your conduct  You will estrange them from you  The Page  76 man will not be a King Log—Be you a prudent Frog  lest you turn him into a Stork  A weak man  if you suppose him weak  made a tyrant  will be an insupportable thing  I shall make him appear weak in the eyes of every body else  when I have so much grace left  as would make me rise against any one who should let me know they thought him so  My brother will be reflected upon for his solicitude to carry me to church with a man  whom I shall make the world think I despise  Harriet will renounce me  My wit will be thought folly  Does not the suckling Emily  does not the stale virgin  aunt Eleanor  think they have a right to blame  entreat  instruct me  I will be good of choice  and make my duty received as a favour  I have travelled a great way in the road of perverseness  I see briars  thorns  and a pathless track  before me  I may be benighted  The day is far gone  Serpents may be in the brakes  I will get home as fast
