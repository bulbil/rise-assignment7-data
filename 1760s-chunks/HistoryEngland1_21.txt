and Magistrates of the metropolis came out to meet him  and offer him a crown which they no longer had in their power to refuse  William was glad of thus peaceably being put in possession of a throne  which several of his predecessors had not gained but by repeated victories  he complied with the terms which were offered him  and  among these terms  it is to be presumed  the Church s interests were not forgotten  Though William had it in his power to force the people into a compliance with his views  yet he chose to have their election of him considered as a voluntary gift of their own  He knew himself to be their conqueror  he desired to be thought their lawful King   Thus was William possessed of an idea of his own power to enforce obedience  and the English of their own generosity  in having freely presented him with a crown  Impressed with such opposite sentiments  the one was inclined to oppress a people  whom he  in fact  thought incapable of resistance  and they  on the other hand  were inclined to revolt against one  whom they fancied to have had received  from their own hands  all authority  Numberless  therefore  were the insurrections of the English against their   61 new Monarch  and every suppressed rebellion only gave fresh instances of the Conqueror s mildness and humanity  The English were unwilling to pay any taxes  towards inriching those they now began to look upon as conquerors  and William was under the most solemn engagements of providing for those adventurers who had left their native country to place him on the throne   Hitherto William had acted like one who was rather the father than the invader of the country  when news was brought him  that a body of Northumbrian English  assisted by the Danes  had set upon the Norman garrison in York castle  and put every man to the sword  After repeated rebellions  which he had quelled before  and such frequent pardons  which were the consequence  he now found that nothing but rigour would do for the future  He marched therefore to meet the enemy  bought off the Danes for a sum of money  and took a signal revenge upon the Northumbrians  unable to oppose him   From this time he seems to have regarded England rather as a conquest than a justly acquired dominion  His diffidence of the English became more conspicuous every day  and his partiality to the Normans more galling  All places of trust and confidence were taken from the one and given to the other  from this time he thought only of establishing himself on the throne  without nicely examining whether the means were consonant to justice and humanity   If historians  who seem partial in other respects  are to be credited  England was then in a most deplorable situation  The Normans committed continual insults on the conquered people  and they seldom found any redress from their governors    62 in both cases  therefore  they generally revenged themselves by private murders  and a day seldom passed but the bodies of assassinated Normans were found in the woods and highways  without any possibility of bringing the perpetrators to justice  But what is represented as the peculiar grievance of the times  was  that the English were deprived of arms  and were forbid having any lights in their houses after eight o clock in the evening  At this hour a bell was rung to warn them to put out their fire and candle  and this  which was called the Curfew  was very grating to the ears of the people   Insurrections are ever the consequence of oppression  in a brave nation  William was sensible of this  and generally attempted to moderate the cruel counsels of his countrymen by a gentle treatment of the offenders  Edgar Atheling  who had the best successive right to the crown  was amongst the number of those who experienced his lenity and faith  This Prince had gone over to the Scotch  and had persuaded their King to join him  with an army  in asserting his right to the English crown  William met their forces in the northern parts of England  and  instead of a battle  proposed a negotiation  Peace was established between the two nations  and Edgar was included in the treaty  He continued  from that time  to live  as a private man  in opulence and security  and passed the rest of his life  perhaps  more happily than if he had continued in the career of his ambition   William  having nothing at present to fear from war  turned all his thoughts to the arts of peace  He was not yet sufficiently arbitrary to change all the laws  now in being  for those of his own   63 country  he only made several innovations  and ordered all law pleas  in the several courts  to be made in the Norman language  These precautions  instead of making the Norman language the study of all  confined the law to the peculiar study of a few  The English language still continued to be spoken  and  such was the esteem it was held in  even so early  that it began to be spoken at the court of Scotland  and in several adjacent countries  and never was the French less engrafted
