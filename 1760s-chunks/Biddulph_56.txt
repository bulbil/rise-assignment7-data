 that we should again press him to accept of apartments in our house  I see he is determined to keep up nothing more than an intercourse barely civil  Mr Arnold cannot but be disgusted with his behaviour  but he is too delicate to take notice of it to me   October 17  I am disappointed in my hopes of seeing my dear mother in town this winter  Her apartment was ready for her  and I delighted myself with the thoughts of seeing her in possession of it  at least for a few months  but she writes me word that her old rheumatick complaint is returned on her with such violence  that she cannot think of undertaking the journey  Sadly am I grieved at this news  and shall long to have the winter over  that Mr Arnold and I may fly to Sidney castle  he has promised me this satisfaction early in the summer   My mother informs me that Miss Burchell constantly corresponds with her  she tells her that her aunt is come to town to sollicit for her pension  but that she never sees her  and as she means to drop all correspondence with her  she does not intend even to let her know where she lodges  I commend Miss Burchell highly for this  as the acquaintance of such a woman may be hurtful to her reputation    Here ensues another interval of nine months  in which nothing particular is related  but that Mrs Arnold became mother to a second child  This last circumstance  with a few others preceding and succeeding that event  are related in the Journal by her maid Patty  after which Mrs Arnold herself proceeds    July 1  1705  Again  my dear Cecilia  I am able to reassume my pen  I have read what Patty has writ  and find she is admirable at the anecdotes of a    nursery  Am I not rich  think you  Two daughters  and both perfect beauties  and great wits you may be sure   The new born damsel was baptized this day by the dear beloved name of Cecilia  I am angry with Mr Arnold  he takes so little notice of this young stranger  his affections are all engaged by Dolly  indeed  I am almost jealous of her  for he spends most of the time he is at home in the nursery   Our antagonist is grown alert again  and has renewed her efforts  which we thought began to flag a little  with fresh vigour  Whence she derives those revived hopes is a mystery  but she now says  she would not accept of a composition if it were offered  My poor Mr Arnold begins to fret a little  it now and then makes him thoughtful  not that he says he has the least doubt about his success  but he has been much harrassed with the necessary attendance that the cause requires  and downright tired with dangling after lawyers  besides  they say the cause cannot come to an hearing in the ensuing term  though they before made us hope  that it would be at an end long before this time   July 3  I am mortified exceedingly  my dear Cecilia  I find I am not likely to see my mother this summer  I thought I could not have lived so long from her sight  Indeed it was purely in the hope of making her this visit  that I prevented her coming to town in the spring  which she purposed doing  though far from being well enough to undertake the journey  I own I have been impatient under my confinement  as that  and my previous circumstances  detained us so long in town  and I this day asked Mr Arnold when we should set out for Sidney castle  He answered me  that he feared it would not be in his power this season to pay the intended visit to my mother  he says  he has not been near his estate in Kent these five years  except for a day or two at a time  and that he thinks it necessary to see what condition it is in  I believe I have told you that there is a pretty house on it  The place is called South park  and is that which my mother chose for my settlement  Mr Arnold  who always preferred Arnold abbey to it  hardly ever visited this place  and as he never resided there  and only lay at an inn when he went down  the house is unfurnished  excepting a room or two  which a man who receives his rent has just made habitable for his own convenience   But that I have laid it down as a rule never to oppose so good  so    indulgent a husband as Mr Arnold is  in any instance  wherein I do not think a superior duty requires me to do so  I should certainly show some disapprobation of what he now purposes doing  It will be attended with so much trouble  so much expence too  he has ordered the house at South park to be completely furnished  and says  he hopes I shall like it so well as to be induced to pass the remainder of the summer there  Most sure it is  every place will be delightful to me where I can enjoy his company  and have my
