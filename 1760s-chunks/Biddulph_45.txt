fineries  destined I thought to another purpose  are lying quietly in my trunks at home  But then one might have contrived many little occasions of delay  There was a house to be fixed upon  and I had twenty things to do  and  as my mother says  many things fall out between the cup and the lip  But all my expectations are blown away  and I have but one poor fortnight given me to recollect my scattered thoughts  when they are all to be centered in Mr Arnold  I am not merry  my Cecilia  but I am determined not to appear sad  neither am I so  I hope I have no reason   My mother purposes writing again to Sir George  to desire his presence at my marriage  I hope he will behave respectfully to every one here  if he should come   October 5  Mr Arnold has writ to town  to bespeak a new chariot  he will do nothing in regard to the house  till I am on the spot to please myself  I intend sending Patty to town  to bring me down my bridal trappings   Mr Arnold has given some necessary orders for the new decking of his person  as well as some of the apartments in the old mansion house  which seem a little to want refurnishing  most of the goods having been inhabitants there since the time of his great grandfather   October 9  My mother’s last letter to Sir George has produced the following answer  which he sent by Patty  when she returned down here with my cloaths   Madam   I am sorry I cannot accept of the invitation you favour me with  to be present at my sister’s nuptials  Some affairs in Wiltshire require my immediate attendance  and I had settled matters before I received your summons  so as to set out as on this day  I wish you all imaginable satisfaction in your new son in law  and my sister abundance of happiness in her spouse   I am  Madam   c     London  October 8  I am glad Sir George does not come down  I am sure if he did  his behaviour would be such  as would render him no very acceptable guest at Grimston hall   A week  but a short week  to come  before my fate is irrevocably fixed  or revocable only by the hand of death  This reflection  solemn as it is  does not alarm me  because  after again calling my heart to the strictest account  I think I can pronounce it intirely free  Mr Arnold will soon have an indisputable right to it  and it is my firm purpose to use my utmost endeavours to give him intire possession of it  He every day gains upon my esteem  If his talents are not so glittering as I have seen some others possessed of  he is nevertheless master of an exceedingly good understanding  which a sort of diffidence in his manner does not suffer him to shew at once to the best advantage  His temper is extremely sweet  and he seems to have an openness of heart  when he throws off a little shyness which he has contracted  that is exceedingly engaging  His love for me appears as fervent as I believe it sincere  and I should be ungrateful not to do my utmost to return it   October 14  How precipitate has been my fortune  Twice within these three months have I been almost at the eve of my intended nuptials  Those which were to have been  I thought as certain as those which are now to be solemnized within two days  Who knows what may still happen to frustrate our present designs —No—there is not another Miss B  to interpose  Mr Arnold seems to be one of those who are born to pass quietly through life  He has already attained to the age of thirty  without one event ever happening to him  but such as happen to every man every day  May no future storm ever interrupt his or my tranquility  for they will soon be one and the same thing   October 16  The die is thrown  my Cecilia  and thy Sidney is the wife of Mr Arnold  This day we were married  the good Dean joined our hands  and his daughter was one of my bride maids  The poor girl was taken ill during the ceremony  and was obliged to leave the church  which has confirmed me in my suspicions—Oh  how I pity her  I believe indeed she only feigned illness for an excuse to retire  Mrs Vere went    out with her  but she would not suffer her to attend her home  She promised to dine with us  if she should be better  and so she did  and seemed chearful and pretty well  but I thought she looked as if she had been crying  She made my heart ache—but I am in hopes it is but a slight wound  she is exceedingly lively  and  I dare say  will soon get the better of it   Lady Grimston was downright tiresome with her compliments  and preached an hour long about the duty of children to their parents  and how good a wife that woman was likely to make  who had always been exemplary in
