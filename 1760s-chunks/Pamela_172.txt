to ponder all   these things  and to admire and bless the goodness of that Providence    which has  through so many intricate mazes  made me tread the paths of   innocence  and so amply rewarded me for what it has itself enabled me to   do  All glory to God alone be ever given for it  by your poor enraptured   daughter           I will now continue my most pleasing relation       As the chariot was returning home from this sweet airing  he said  From   all that has passed between us in this pleasing turn  my Pamela will   see  and will believe  that the trials of her virtue are all over from   me  But  perhaps  there will be some few yet to come of her patience and   humility  For I have  at the earnest importunity of Lady Darnford  and   her daughters  promised them a sight of my beloved girl  And so I intend   to have their whole family  and Lady Jones  and Mrs  Peters s family  to   dine with me once in a few days  And  since I believe you would hardly   choose  at present  to grace the table on the occasion  till you can do   it in your own right  I should be glad you would not refuse coming down   to us if I should desire it  for I would preface our nuptials  said the   dear gentleman  O what a sweet word was that   with their good opinion   of your merits  and to see you  and your sweet manner  will be enough   for that purpose  and so  by degrees  prepare my neighbours for what   is to follow  And they already have your character from me  and are   disposed to admire you       Sir  said I  after all that has passed  I should be unworthy  if I could   not say  that I can have no will but yours  And however awkwardly   I shall behave in such company  weighed down with a sense of   your obligations on one side  and my own unworthiness  with their   observations on the other  I will not scruple to obey you       I am obliged to you  Pamela  said he  and pray be only dressed as you   are  for since they know your condition  and I have told them the story   of your present dress  and how you came by it  one of the young ladies   begs it as a favour  that they may see you just as you are  and I am   the rather pleased it should be so  because they will perceive you owe   nothing to dress  but make a much better figure with your own native   stock of loveliness  than the greatest ladies arrayed in the most   splendid attire  and adorned with the most glittering jewels       O sir  said I  your goodness beholds your poor servant in a light   greatly beyond her merit  But it must not be expected  that others    ladies especially  will look upon me with your favourable eyes  but    nevertheless  I should be best pleased to wear always this humble garb    till you  for your own sake  shall order it otherwise  for  oh    sir  said I  I hope it will be always my pride to glory most in your   goodness  and it will be a pleasure to me to shew every one  that  with   respect to my happiness in this life  I am entirely the work of your   bounty  and to let the world see from what a lowly original you have   raised me to honours  that the greatest ladies would rejoice in       Admirable Pamela  said he  excellent girl   Surely thy sentiments are   superior to those of all thy sex   I might have addressed a hundred fine   ladies  but never  surely  could have had reason to admire one as I do   you       As  my dear father and mother  I repeat these generous sayings  only   because they are the effect of my master s goodness  being far from   presuming to think I deserve one of them  so I hope you will not   attribute it to my vanity  for I do assure you  I think I ought rather   to be more humble  as I am more obliged  for it must be always a sign of   a poor condition  to receive obligations one cannot repay  as it is of   a rich mind  when it can confer them without expecting or needing a   return  It is  on one side  the state of the human creature  compared    on the other  to the Creator  and so  with due
