husband had left in her power  and she had unhappily lavished   in pursuits to the criminal nature of which he had opened her   eyes      As all that was not dissipated beyond recovery was what she had   given to him  and her restoring it  therefore  must depend on his   making a restitution to her first  he was not a moment at a loss   for the drift of this extraordinary instance of penitence  nor how   to treat the account of it  He immediately returned her an answer    congratulating her in his turn  with sincerity equal to her own    on her pious resolutions  the intention of which  he said  would   make amends for the impossibility of carrying them into execution   any farther than by stinting herself to the indispensable necessaries   of life  and laying up the rest of her large income to supply the place   of the sums she had expended      Such an answer necessarily drew on an explanation  and of   course a demand of the several presents she had made him in the   course of their dalliance  and knew he had laid up  as he lived at   her expense all the time  This was no more than he expected    He replied  therefore  without being in the least disconcerted  that   he looked upon everything he had received from her not as presents    but payment for the time he had devoted to attending upon her    and for that reason thought it inconsistent with that regard for   justice which is inseparable from true piety  for her to demand such   a restitution  especially aa she must be sensible that he could not   now make it  without doing wrong to his wife  who had an undoubted   property in everything that belonged to him  and concluded with   desiring that a correspondence  which might be misunderstood    and so disturb his connubial happiness  might be dropped between   them      This sufficiently explained the motives of his conduct  and the   despicable situation which she had brought herself to  However    she was obliged to acquiesce with the best grace she could  without   even the poor satisfaction of revenge  for he had taken care to   insert in every paragraph of his letters such anecdotes of the con    nection that had been between them  that it was impossible for   her to show them  in order to expose him  without exposing herself         ADVENTURES OF A OVINE A 409     at the same time  to the contempt and detestation of the world    From this time  therefore  all intercourse beyond that of common   civility was broken off between them  though some consequences   of their former connection  which happened after her death  make   one of the most striking parts of his story  as shall be observed in   the proper place      The first essays of a man s disposition indicate the rule by which   his whole life will be conducted  The interest of the family into   which he had thus stolen had no sooner raised him to some degree   of power  than he aspired to the highest  to attain which he resolved   to pursue a method exactly in his character  This was to ingratiate   himself  he regarded not by what means  with one of the first person    ages  in the state  whose interest he meant to make use of  as long as it   could serve him  and then fly in his face to show his independence    Nature had never endowed a man with qualifications fitter for such   a purpose  He was ever3rthing to every man  The gay were struck   with his wit  the grave with his solidity  while an appearance of   candour and sincerity  that lulled suspicion to sleep  won the con    fidence of all with whom he conversed  all which powers of pleasing   were  by a servility of disposition  derived  perhaps  from a servile   birth  prostituted to the humour of those whom he desired to please    however contrary to his own      I see your curiosity at my saying that the servility of his dis    position might perhaps be derived from a servile birth  You want   to have the origin of the affections of the human soul explained    whether they are imprinted on it  at its first emanation  from the   source of all existence  or received by traduction from the immediate   parents of the body  or only caused by the casual operation of   external objects  But this  as I have said in other cases  is a   difficulty that I am not at liberty to solve  as the question is not yet   determined by the learned  though much ingenious reasoning has   been displayed on every side
