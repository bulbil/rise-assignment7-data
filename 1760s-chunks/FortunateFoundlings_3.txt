real   name we think proper to conceal under that of Dorilaus  returned from   visiting most of the polite courts of Europe  in which he had passed   some time divided between pleasure and improvement  The important   question if the throne were vacated or not  by the sudden departure of   the unfortunate king James  was then upon the tapis  on which  to avoid   interesting himself on either side  he forbore coming to London  and   crossed the country to a fine feat he had about some forty miles   distant  where he resolved to stay as privately as he could  till the   great decision should be made  and the public affairs settled in such a   manner as not to lay him under a necessity of declaring his sentiments   upon them       He was young and gay  loved magnificence and the pomp of courts  and was   far from being insensible of those joys which the conversation of the   fair sex affords  but had never so much enslaved his reason to any one   pleasure  as not to be able to refrain it  Hunting and reading were very   favourite amusements with him  so that the solitude he now was in was   not at all disagreeable or tedious to him  tho  he continued in it   some months       A little time before his departure an accident happened  which gave him   an opportunity of exercising the benevolence of his disposition  and    tho  it then seemed trivial to him  proved of the utmost consequence to   his future life  as well as furnished matter for the following pages       As he was walking pretty early one morning in his garden  very intent on   a book he had in his hand  his meditations were interrupted by an   unusual cry  which seemed at some distance  but as he approached a   little arbour  where he was sometimes accustomed to sit  he heard more   plain and distinct  and on his entrance was soon convinced whence it   proceeded       Just at the foot of a large tree  the extensive boughs of which greatly   contributed to form the arbour  was placed a basket closely covered on   the one side  and partly open on the other to let in the air  Tho  the   sounds which still continued to issue from it left Dorilaus no room to   doubt what it contained  he stooped down to look  and saw two beautiful   babes neatly dressed in swadling cloaths  between them and the pillow   they were laid upon was pinned a paper  which he hastily taking off    found in it these words           To the generous  DORISLAUS        Irresistible destiny abandons these helpless infants   to your care   They are twins  begot   by the same father  and born of the same mother    and of a blood not unworthy the protection   they stand in need of  which if you vouchsafe to   afford  they will have no cause to regret the misfortune   of their birth  or accuse the authors of   their being   Why they seek it of you in particular    you may possibly be hereafter made sensible   In   the mean time content yourself with   knowing they are already baptized by the names   of Horatio and Louisa           The astonishment he was in at so unexpected a present being made him    may more easily be imagined than expressed  but he had then no time to   form any conjectures by whom or by what means it was left there  the   children wanted immediate succour  and he hesitated not a moment whether   it would become him to bestow it  he took the basket up himself  and   running as fast as he could with it into the house  called his   maid servants about him  and commanded them to give these little   strangers what assistance was in their power  while a man was sent among   the tenants in search of nurses proper to attend them  To what person   soever  said he  I am indebted for this confidence  it must not be   abused   Besides  whatever stands in need of protection  merits   protection from those who have the power to give it       This was his way of thinking  and in pursuance of these generous   sentiments he always acted  The report of what happened in his house   being soon spread thro  the country  there were not wanting several who   came to offer their service to the children  out of which he selected   two of whom he heard the best character  and were most likely to be   faithful to the trust reposed in them  giving as great a charge  and as   handsome
