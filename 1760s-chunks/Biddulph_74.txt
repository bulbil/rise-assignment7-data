 if possible  to lead him into a conversation  by which they hoped  in some measure  to have cleared my innocence  as my lord could take upon him to justify Mr Faulkland  but he declined coming  not knowing  perhaps  that Mr Faulkland was absent from V—— hall  She said  her lord had gone to South Park  but either Mr Arnold was not at home  or denied himself  My Lady adds  ‘It is a delicate affair to interpose in  yet would I have ventured to have wrote to your husband  if I had been sure that you had no objection to my telling him  that you had made me privy to the cause of your parting  ‘tis plain  by his avoiding us  it is a subject he does not care to come to an explanation upon  Let me have your sentiments  and I will act accordingly ’  I shall answer Lady V——’s letter directly  and beg of her to leave    the matter as it is  Mrs Gerrarde’s testimony will have more weight than all my good lord or lady could urge in my favour  besides  they are not furnished with sufficient weapons to combat against such an enemy  they know nothing of Miss Burchell’s story  my regard to her character prevented me from giving my lady this specimen of her aunt’s baseness  I suppose the same reason may have closed Mr Faulkland’s lips on that subject  so that they have nothing to allege against Mrs Gerrarde  which would help to invalidate her testimony with regard to Mr Faulkland and me  Mr Arnold  indeed  knows that she has forfeited her pretensions to modesty  but the delusion of self love blinds a man in those cases  and he can believe  that truth  sincerity  and justice  inhabit the bosom of her  whose passion for him alone has caused a deviation from chastity   I cannot think of exposing the poor Miss Burchell by giving up her secret  Though it might contribute to clear me  by turning Mr Arnold’s suspicions on Mrs Gerrarde  yet would she have great reason to resent it  more especially as she is now  by a blameless life  endeavouring to blot out the memory of her fault  Though my Lady V—— is very prudent  her zeal for me  and my lord’s good natured earnestness in my cause  might render them unguarded on the occasion  and should they attempt to make use of this secret  in order to eliminate Mrs Gerrarde  it might  at the same time  bring malicious censures both on Miss Burchell and Mr Faulkland   I think  upon the whole  my mother is the properest person to mediate on this occasion  When Mr Arnold comes to town  she can  with due tenderness to the young lady  disclose the whole affair to him  The knowlege of this black part of Mrs Gerrarde’s character  joined to her arguments  may perhaps have some weight  though  to tell you the secret bodings of my heart  I expect not much from this  I have lost my husband’s love  Mrs Gerrarde possesses it all  and who knows whether he even wishes to lose his pretence for abandoning an unhappy wife  I wish  however  Mr Faulkland were returned to V—— hall  should Mr Arnold know of his absence at this juncture  he might imagine possibly he was gone in quest of me   October 12  How the scene is changed  my sister  What a melancholy reverse is here  to my late prospect of domestic happiness  I pass my nights in tears  and bitter reflections on my dismal situation  My days are spent in a painful constraint  to conceal the anguish of my own heart  that I    may not aggravate that of my poor mother  My endeavours to be chearful  I perceive  have a good effect on her  she is much more composed  and seems resigned to our fate  patiently waiting for a change  I think too she is rather better in her health  she has had the advice of a physician of eminent skill  the medicines prescribed  he gives us hopes  will keep her disorder at least from gaining ground  and that she may hold out for some years   I have prevailed on her not to give Sir George an account of my unhappy story  till I hear that Mr Faulkland has left him  because I know my brother would conceal nothing from him  and  if possible  I would have Mr Arnold’s suspicions of Him concealed  I have many reasons for this  my own delicacy would receive a wound by it  for who knows what judgment Mr Faulkland might form on this knowlege  But my most material objection is  should he attempt to vindicate his own honour  what might be the consequence  I shudder to think of it  I know Mr Faulkland is rash  when provoked  Rather let my sufferings and my disgrace lie wrapped in oblivion  than bring any disaster on the father of my children   October 16  Another letter from Lady V——  She tells me  that Mr Faulkland is returned from his visit to my brother  He was soon informed of my parting with Mr Arnold  ’tis the talk of the neighbourhood  every body lays it on Mrs Gerrarde
