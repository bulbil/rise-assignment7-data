clear this contradiction much to the satisfaction of the polite part of the assembly  I have now the honour to speak before—because—cough and hem again—I say  because ladies and gentlemen  I have not only considered the nature of ghosts philosophically  but by every rule of prespective  as far as is relative to the vanishing —Have I  Sir Greenfin  your permission to proceed  bowing low as he addressed the president  the president as low down bowing in return     Upon which the professor of universal connoisseurship in arts and sciences  looking about him with much consequence  coughed  hemmed  spit  wiped his mouth  smoothed his foretop  spread his stock  pulled his ruffles  and began     Every ghost  every ghost  and every apparition  and every apparition as well as every ghost possesses in its own nature  two sides or contrasuperficies  which are denominated philosophically  Page  96  an opaque side and a lucid one—cough —now the two witnesses being  as it were  fixed or placed at opposite angles  saw the opposite sides of the ghost—for instance  the drawer who saw it a black ghost  had his rays of light absorbed  by refrangibility of reflection  while the other had a view of the ghost  in his illuminated state arising from refraction  because the radiancy of the rays  striking upon the retina  and this pellucidity of shade  is called by the painters  the CLEAR OBSCURE—cough   c     Thus therefore I form my hypothesis—coughs —Suppose my left thumb to be A  my left little finger B  all my left hand C —Hem—hem—now therefore  I say  A plus  B  B minus  C  because every person being capable of seeing a dark or a light  that is an opaque  or a lucid superficies  or side belonging to my finger and thumb  not only according as I form it into an inclined plain  then the shades and lights fly off in tangents of obtuse angles  or if that the object refracted is diametrically opposite in a horizontal parallel to the optic nerve  thus it was  one saw the apparition in a black or nigriferous point of sight  and the other beheld it as a light  or illuminated appearance —Cough  hem and spit     Had I  my most ineffable auditors  had I my books and instruments here  I might perhaps have demonstrated this more clearly     Sir Tim  Dowgate replied  it was clear indeed  and he apprehended every syllable on t—vastly clear indeed  lady Dowgate answered  the doctor s a most amazing man of science  and I am positive has more true learning than all Doctors Commons —Indeed lady Hadit observed  nothing could have been delivered more  Page  97  clearly  and she understood every word on t  So do I  so do I  its immensely clear  vastly so replied all the polite heap  and agreed  that as a scholar  an artist  an orator  and connoisseur  Dr  Sinecure was quite the thing  and they were sure on t     The under bred part of the assembly  allowed him to be a most wonderful man  and every one  gentle and simple  joined in praising loudly his late lecture  and great learning  and they agreed he had made it out so well  that they all understood it     The doctor condescended to incline his head in a direction  between a bow and a nod  with the utmost pedagogick consequence     Then Sir Green fin Calipash stood up  and tucking his neckcloth ends under his garnet breast buckle  he begged leave to observe  that as he had always made the good of this nation his study  and would venture to say  that he knew both Old and New England s political constitution  as well as any one man in it  Yet he could not say  although he apprehended every thing doctor Sinecure had said  yet he could not say he understood the meaning of these affairs about black and white ghosts  because  though he believed in ghosts as much as any christian could  yet why sholud ghosts be black or white either  why might they not as well be of any other colours     Dr  SINECURE   Black and white are no colours  Black is an absorbment  white an aggregate—hem—ghosts cannot be of any colour—ergo—hem  hem  hem     Page  98  Sir GREENFIN   So then I suppose you would persuade me  by that inuendo of ghosts not being of any colour  that they can t be of any party  but I know better  I know that ghosts are as liable to be in the French interest  as they are to be of ours  and that this may be a political stroke  either of our foreign or domestick enemies—may not the thief takers and ghosts have a fellow feeling     Lady HADIT   Screaming out a laugh   A fellow see—e—eling—oh  Sir Calipash  what an idea —can ghosts feel     Enter Landlord in shirt and napkin night cap   Lady Hadit was the first who viewed him  and her ladyship gave a loud shriek  sprung upon on the window
