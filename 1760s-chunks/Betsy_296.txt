 in his attempt        Lady Loveit having finished her long narrative  and received the   compliments of Mrs  Munden for the trouble she had given her  was   beginning to ask some questions concerning her own affairs  but some   ladies coming in  broke off  for the present  all conversation on this   head  and Mrs  Munden soon after took leave  though not without   receiving an assurance from the other of having her visit returned in a   short time                CHAPTER XVI       Presents the reader  among many other particulars  with a full  though   as concise an account as can be given  of the real quality and condition   of the lady that Mrs  Munden had seen  and been so much charmed with  at   the mercer s          Mrs  Munden carried enough home with her from Lady Loveit s to employ   her mind  for that whole night at least  What she had been told in   relation to the death of Mrs  Trueworth  raised a strange contrariety of   ideas in her  which it was impossible for her either to reconcile  or   oblige either the one or the other totally to subside       She thought it great pity that so virtuous  so beautiful  and so   accomplished  a young lady  as she had been told Mrs  Trueworth was    should thus early be snatched away from all the joys of love and life    but could not lament so melancholy an accident in a manner she was   sensible it deserved  envy had ever been a stranger to her breast  yet    since her own marriage  and that of Mr  Trueworth with his lady  she had   sometimes been tempted to accuse Heaven of partiality  in making so wide   a difference in their fate  and  though the blame of her misfortunes lay   wholly on herself  had been apt to imagine that she had only been   impelled  by an unavoidable impulse  to act as she had done  and was   fated  by an invincible necessity  to be the enemy of her own happiness       Thus did this fair predestinarian reason within herself whenever the   ill usage of Mr  Munden made her reflect on the generosity of Mr    Trueworth  She repined not at the felicities she supposed were enjoyed   by Mrs  Trueworth  but regretted that her own lot had been cast so   vastly different       But though all these little heart burnings now ceased by the death of   that so late happy lady  and even common humanity demanded the tribute   of compassion for her destiny  of which none had a greater share  on   other occasions  than Mrs  Munden  yet could she not on this pay it   without some interruptions from a contrary emotion  in these moments  if   it may be said she grieved at all  it was more because she knew that Mr    Trueworth was grieved  than for the cause that made him so       Her good sense  her justice  and her good nature  however  gave an   immediate check to such sentiments whenever she found them rising in   her  but her utmost efforts could not wholly subdue them  there was a   secret something in her heart which she would never allow herself to   think she was possessed of  that  in spite of all she could do  diffused   an involuntary satisfaction at the knowledge that Mr  Trueworth was a   widower       If Lady Loveit could have foreseen the commotions her discourse raised   in the breast of her fair friend  she would certainly never have   entertained her with it  but she so little expected her having any   tenderness for Mr  Trueworth  that she observed not the changes in her   countenance when she mentioned that gentleman  as she afterwards   frequently did  on many occasions  in the course of the visits to each   other  nor could Mrs  Munden  being ignorant herself of the real cause   of the agitation she was in  make her ladyship a confidante in this  as   she did in all her other affairs  the little happiness she enjoyed in   marriage not excepted       Lady Loveit had  indeed  a pretty right idea of her misfortune in this   point  before she heard it from herself  Sir Bazil  though not at all   conversant with Mr  Munden  was well acquainted with his character and   manner of behaviour  and the account he gave of both to her on being   told to whom he was married  left her no room to doubt how disagreeable   a situation the wife of such a husband must be in  She heartily
