—  I answered with a submissive bow  that I was far from rejecting his friendly offer  of which I would immediately avail myself  as soon as he should   42 inform me  on what footing I should be entertained —   What footing  d—n my blood  cried he  d ye expect to have a footman and couple of horses kept for you  —  No  Sir  I replied  my expectations are not quite so sanguine —That I may be as little burthensome as possible  I would willingly serve in your shop  by which means I may save you the expence of a journey man  or porter at least  for I understand a little pharmacy  having employed some of my leisure hours in the practice of that art  while I lived with Mr  Potion  neither am I altogether ignorant of surgery  which I have studied with great pleasure and application —   O ho  you did  says Crab  Gentlemen  here is a compleat artist —Studied surgery  what  in books I suppose —I shall have you disputing with me  one of these days  on points of my profession —You can already account for muscular motion  I warrant  and explain the mystery of the brain and nerves—ha —You are too learned for me  d—n me —But let s hear no more of this stuff —can you bleed and give a clyster  spread a plaister and prepare a potion  answer me to that  —  Upon my answering him in the affirmative  he shook his head  telling me  he believed he should have little good of me  for all my promises —but however  he would take me in for the sake of charity —I was accordingly that very night admitted to his house  and had an apartment assigned to me in the garret  which I was fain to put up with  notwithstanding the mortification my pride suffered in this change of circumstances  I was soon convinced of the real motives which induced Crab to receive me   43 in this manner  for besides the gratification of his revenge  in exposing the selfishness of his antagonist  in opposition to his own generosity  which was all affectation  he had occasion for a young man who understood something of the profession  to fill up the place of his eldest apprentice  lately dead  not without violent suspicion of foul play from his master s brutality —The knowledge of this  together with his daily behaviour to his wife  and the young apprentice  did not at all contribute to my enjoying my new situation with ease  however  as I did not perceive how I could bestow myself to better advantage  I resolved to study Crab s temper with all the application  and manage it with all the address I was master of —And it was not long before I found out a strange peculiarity of humour  which governed his behaviour towards all his dependants —I observed when he was pleased  he was such a niggard of his satisfaction  that if his wife or servants betrayed the least symptom of participation  he was offended to an insupportable degree of choler and fury  the effects of which they seldom failed to feel —And when his indignation was roused  submission and soothing always exasperated it beyond the bounds of reason and humanity —I therefore pursued a contrary plan  and one day  when he honoured me with the names of ignorant whelp and lazy ragamuffin—I boldly replied  I was neither ignorant nor lazy  since I both understood  and performed my business as well as he could do for his soul  neither was it just to call me ragamuffin  for I had a whole coat on my back  and was descended from a better family than any he could boast an alliance with  He gave tokens of great amazement   44 at this assurance of mine  and shook his cane over my head  regarding me all the time with a countenance truly diabolical Although I was terribly startled at his menacing looks and posture  I yet had reflection enough left  to convince me  I had gone too far to retract  and that this was the critical minute which must decide my future lot  in his service  whereupon I snatched up the pestle of a mortar  and swore if he offered to strike me without cause  I would see whether his scull or my weapon was hardest —He continued silent for some time  and at last broke forth into these ejaculations —   This is fine usage from a servant to a master —very fine —damnation —but  no matter  you shall pay for this  you dog  you shall —I ll do your business—yes  yes  I ll teach you to lift your hand against me  —  So saying  he retired and left me under dreadful apprehensions  which vanished intirely at our next meeting  when he behaved with unusual complacency  and treated me with a glass of punch after dinner —By this conduct  I got the ascendency over him in a short time  and became so necessary to him  in managing his business while he was engaged at the bottle  that fortune began to wear a kinder aspect with regard to me  and I consoled myself for the disregard of my former acquaintance  with the knowledge I daily imbibed  by a close application to the duties of my employment  in
