pressed her with some little peevishness not to delay my bliss  She seemed a little touched by my remonstrances  but thought it too soon to yield  and giving me a gentle rebuff    Hold  said she  you are too importunate  this is like a rake  I fear you are but a loose young fellow  For shame  madam  exclaimed I  can you set your face against what women of the first taste and condition encourage  A prejudice against what is vulgarly called vice may be all very well for citizens  wives  That is decisive  replied she  there is no resisting so forcible a plea  I see plainly that with men of your order dissimulation is to no purpose  a woman must meet you half way  Learn then your victory  added she with an appearance of disorder  as if her modesty suffered by the avowal  you have inspired me with sentiments such as are new to my heart  and I only wait to know who you are  that I may take you for my acknowledged lover  I believe you a young lord and a gentleman  yet there is no trusting to appearances  and however prepossessed I may be in your favour  I would not give away my affections to a stranger  I recollected at the moment how Don Antonio s servant had got out of a similar perplexity  and determining  after his example  to pass for my master    Madam  said I to my dainty widow  I will not excuse myself from telling you my name  it is one that will not disparage its owner  Have you ever heard of Don Matthias de Silva  Yes  replied she  indeed I have seen him with a lady of my acquaintance  Though considerably improved in impudence  I was a little troubled by this discovery  Yet I rallied my forces in an instant  and extricated myself with a happy presence of mind  Well then  my fair one  retorted I  the lady of your acquaintance         knows a lord         of my acquaintance         and I am of his acquaintance  of his own family  since you must know it  His grandfather married the sister in law of my father s uncle  You see we are very near relations  My name is Don Caesar  I am the only son of the great Don Ferdinand de Ribera  slain fifteen years ago  in a battle on the frontiers of Portugal  I could give you all the particulars of the action  it was a devilish sharp one         but to fight it over again would be losing the precious moments of mutual love   After this discourse I got to be importunate and impassioned  but without bringing matters at all forwarder  The favours which my goddess winked at my snatching  tended only to make me languish for what she was more chary of  The tyrant got back to her coach  which was waiting at the door  Nevertheless  I withdrew  well enough pleased with my success  though it still fell short of the only perfect issue  If said I to myself  I have obtained indulgences but by halves  it is because this lady  forsooth  is a high born dame  and thinks it beneath her quality to play the very woman at the first interview  The pride of pedigree stands in the way of my advancement just now  but in a few days we shall be better acquainted  To be sure  it did not once come into my head  that she might be one of those cunning gipsies always on the catch  Yet I liked better to look at things on the right side than on the wrong  and thus maintained a favourable opinion of my widow  We had agreed at parting to meet again on the day after the morrow  and the hope of arriving at the summit of my wishes gave me a foretaste of the pleasures with which I tickled my fancy   With my brain full of joyous traces  I returned to my barber  Having changed my dress  I went to attend my master at the tennis court  I found him at play  and saw that he won  for he was not one of those impenetrable gamesters who make or mar a fortune without moving a muscle  In prosperity he was flippant and overbearing  but quite peevish on the losing side  He left the tennis court in high spirits  and went for the Prince s Theatre  I followed him to the boxdoor  then putting a ducat into my hand   Here  Gil Blas  said he  as I have been a winner to  day  you shall not be the worse for it  go  divert yourself with your friends  and come to me about midnight at Arsenia s  where I am to sup with Don Alexo Segiar  He then went in  and I stood debating with whom I should disburse my ducat  according to the pious will of the founder  I did not muse long  Clarin  Don Alexo s servant  just then came in my way  I took him to the next tavern  and we amused ourselves there till midnight  Thence we repaired to
