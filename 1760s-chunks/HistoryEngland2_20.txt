was now dissolved by an act of the most flagrant oppression  The people  however  expressed no dislike at their dissolution  Cromwell received congratulatory addresses from the fleet  the corporations  and the army  but he was unwilling to put forth all his power at once  he resolved to amuse them with the form of a commonwealth  and familiarize them by degrees to arbitrary government  He decreed  that the sovereign power should be vested in one hundred and forty four persons  under the denomination of a parliament  and he undertook himself to make the choice  The persons he pitched upon were the lowest  meanest  and most ignorant among the citizens  he foresaw  that  during the administration of such  he alone must govern  or that they would soon throw up the reins of government  which they were unqualified to guide  To excel in fanaticism seemed a necessary qualification in this new parliament  Several  with long names borrowed from scripture  were members  but a man  whose name was Praise God Barebones  was one of the most remarkable  and by his name the assembly was afterwards called in ridicule   To this assembly was committed the care of making peace with the Dutch  but  being utterly unskilled in such negotiations  the ambassadors of the States were quite at a loss how to treat with them  The people exclaimed at so foolish a legislature  and they themselves seemed not insensible of the contempt and ridicule which they every day failed not to incur  They had now sat five months without doing any thing of importance  when at length Rouse  their speaker  rose up  and proposed that  as they were unable to bear the burthen that was laid upon them    52 they should resign their authority …im from whom they had received it  Cromwell accepted their resignation with pleasure  and sent Colonel White to clear the house of the few fanatics who persisted in continuing to sit  White  entering with a detachment of soldiers  asked    What they did there   To which replying  that they were seeking the Lord   Then you may go elsewhere  cried he  for to my certain knowledge the Lord has not been here these many years      The officers now  by their own authority  declared Cromwell Protector  He was possessed of that which is the original of all command  namely  force  for the strong ever give laws to the feeble  The mayor and aldermen were sent for  the usurper was installed at Whitehall  in the palace of the English Kings  he assumed the office of Protector  was honoured with the epithet of Highness  and proclaimed in London  and other parts of the kingdom  Thus an obscure inhabitant of Wales  at length  rose to unlimited power  far beyond that of former Kings  by his courage and his hypocrisy   He was about fifty three years of age when he began to reign  which he did with equal conduct  moderation  and success  He  in the beginning  chose among the officers  the former companions of his dangers and victories  twenty one counsellors of state  to each of whom he assigned a pension of one thousand pounds a year  The troops were always paid a month in advance  the magazines were well provided  the public treasure  of which he had the disposal  was managed with frugality and care  The Dutch were compelled to sue for peace  and he dictated the terms  He insisted upon their paying deference to the British flag  They were compelled to abandon the interest of the King  they engaged to pay eighty five thousand pounds  as an indemnification for former expences  and to restore the English East India company a part of those dominions   53 of which they had unjustly deprived them in the East   Every nation with whom the English had any connection  now courted their Protector s alliance  Among the number France solicited his aid against Spain  Cromwell  though capable of conducting the internal parts of government  had no skill in foreign policy  He lent his assistance to humble Spain  at a time when the interests of Europe required her exaltation  Cardinal Mazarine gave him up Dunkirk  His fleet  under the conduct of the famous Blake  took the island of Jamaica  The kingdom of Ireland was entirely reduced to obedience  and treated by him as a conquered country  many thousands of the wretched natives strove to find  in banishment  an alleviation of their miseries  numbers died of famine  and by the hands of the executioner not a few   Cromwell  to give the greater appearance of justice to his usurpation  was resolved to govern by parliament  yet by such a parliament alone as he could govern  He assembled them  and dissolved them at pleasure  the house of Lords was entirely discontinued  but he set up a new chamber of parliament  composed of his own creatures  to oppose that elected by the voices of the people  Thus  ever active  vigilant  and resolute  he discovered every conspiracy against his person  and every insurrection among the people  before they took effect  He had the address to prevail upon his parliament to make him an offer of the crown  merely to have the
