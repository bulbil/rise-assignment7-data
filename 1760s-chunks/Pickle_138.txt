the ramparts  touching the strength of  the fortification  which the doctor  according to custom  undervalued   because it was a modern work  saying  that by the help of the military  engines used among the ancients  and a few thousands of pioneers  he  would engage to take it in less than ten days after he should sit down  before it  The North Briton  who was as great a pedant as the physician   having studied fortification  and made himself master of Caesar s  Commentaries and Polybius  with the observations of Folard  affirmed   that all the methods of besieging practised by the ancients would be  utterly ineffectual against such a plan as that of the citadel of Lisle   and began to compare the vineae  aggeres  arietes  scorpiones  and  catapultae of the Romans  with the trenches  mines  batteries  and    6 22 15  3 45 PM   mortars used in the present art of war  The republican  finding himself  attacked upon what he thought his strong side  summoned all his learning  to his aid  and  describing the famous siege of Plateae  happened to  misquote a passage of Thucydides  in which he was corrected by the  other  who  having been educated for the church  was also a connoisseur  in the Greek language  The doctor  incensed at being detected in such  a blunder in the presence of Pallet  who  he knew  would promulgate his  shame  told the officer  with great arrogance  that his objection was  frivolous  and that he must not pretend to dispute on these matters  with one who had considered them with the utmost accuracy and care  His  antagonist  piqued at this supercilious insinuation  replied with  great heat  that for aught he knew  the doctor might be a very expert  apothecary  but that in the art of war  and knowledge of the Greek  tongue  he was no other than an ignorant pretender   This asseveration produced an answer full of virulence  including a  national reflection upon the soldier s country  and the contention rose  to mutual abuse  when it was suppressed by the admonitions of the other  two  who begged they would not expose themselves in a strange place   but behave themselves like fellow subjects and friends  They accordingly  ceased reviling each other  and the affair was seemingly forgot   but after they had resumed their places in the coach  the painter  unfortunately asked the meaning of the word tortise  which he had  heard them mention among the Roman implements of war  This question was  answered by the physician  who described the nature of this expedient  so little to the satisfaction of the officer  that he contradicted him  flatly in the midst of his explanation  a circumstance which provoked  the republican to such a degree  that  in the temerity of his passion   he uttered the epithet   impertinent scoundrel   which was no sooner  pronounced than the Caledonian made manual application to his nose  and   leaping out of the coach  stood waiting for him on the plain  while he   the physician  made feeble efforts to join him  being easily retained  by the other soldier  and Pallet  dreading the consequence in which he  himself might be involved  bellowed aloud for prevention   Our hero endeavoured to quiet the commotion by representing to the Scot  that he had already taken satisfaction for the injury he had received   and telling the doctor that he had deserved the chastisement which was  inflicted upon him  but the officer  encouraged perhaps by the confusion  of his antagonist  insisted upon his asking pardon for what he had said   and the doctor  believing himself under the protection of his friend  Pickle  far from agreeing to such concession  breathed nothing but  defiance and revenge  so that the chevalier  in order to prevent  mischief  put the soldier under arrest  and sent him to his lodgings   under the care of the other French gentleman and his own companion  they  being also accompanied by Mr  Jolter  who  having formerly seen all the  curiosities of Lisle  willingly surrendered his place to the physician   CHAPTER LI    Pickle engages with a Knight of Malta  in a Conversation upon the  English Stage  which is followed by a Dissertation on the Theatres of  the Ancients  by the Doctor     6 22 15  3 45 PM   The rest of the company proceeded to the arsenal  which having viewed   together with some remarkable churches  they  in their return  went to  the comedy  and saw the Cid of Corneille tolerably well represented  In  consequence of this entertainment  the discourse at supper turned upon  dramatic performances  and all the objections of Monsieur Scudery to  the piece they had seen acted  together with the decision of the French  Academy  were canvassed and discussed  The knight was a man of letters  and taste  and particularly well acquainted with the state of the  English stage  so that when the painter boldly pronounced sentence
