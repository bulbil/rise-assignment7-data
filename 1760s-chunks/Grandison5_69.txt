to improve their own  are not the worst of the people of those countries   I told her  proceeded the Bishop  that  to be impartial  there were bad and good of all nations  that she was not likely to be approached by any of her own but who were good  that you  Chevalier  and Mrs  Beaumont  might convince us that there were good people among the Protestants  and that now and then a young man of that profession  did actually appear among us  who was not a discredit to his country  But  continued I  I have heretofore debated the subject with the Chevalier Grandison  You know I was in a manner called upon to do it  And have found him a Protestant upon principle  and that he has a great deal to say for himself  You  Father  would not allow me this  but you never entered into close argument with him on the subject  as I have done   My sister then asked  proceeded the Bishop  if I thought that her own religious principles would be endangered  if she became yours  and went with you to England   We both referred her to certain passages in the paper she gave you   My heart  said she  could never be proof against a generous and kind treatment  The condescending compliances with my weakness  which my father  mother  brothers  and uncle  have made  have effected what opposition and cruelty  as you see  could not  So compassionate  so humane a man  as I think the Chevalier Grandison  and so steady as he is in his principles  so much  as you own  as he has to say for himself  joined with the sense I always had  from my Page  173mother s example  of the duties of a good wife  will too probably stagger me in my faith  And if so  I shall be unhappy  I shall make my confessor so  I am determined  added she  as you  brother  have seen  in my own mind  But I ask your opinion  and yours  Father Marescotti  The Chevalier now is a favourite with you both  Religion only can now be the question—Is it not too probable that I shall be staggered in my own faith  were I to be his   We gave her  continued the Bishop  our opinions freely  as religious men  Could we  Chevalier  do otherwise  And yet we are both ready to accuse ourselves of infringing conditions with you  Tell us  if n your opinion we have   I cannot  my Lord  judge from this general account  If you did more than answer her questions  if you expatiated argumentatively on the subject  I must think you have  And your own doubts help to convince me  that you have  tho  I cannot but respect you greatly for the frankness of your application to me on this subject   We were earnest  Chevalier  we were warm in what we said—  Well  my Lord  called upon as you both were  it would not have become your characters to be cool—For my own part  I have been recollecting the behaviour of your admirable sister throughout every stage of her delirium  respecting myself  And I have not been able to call to mind one instance in it of an attachment merely personal  I need not tell you  Father  nor you  my Lord  what a zealous Catholic she is  She early wished me to be one  And had I not thought myself obliged in honour  because of the confidence placed in me by the whole family  to decline the subject  our particular conversations  when she favoured me with the name of tutor  would have generally taken that turn  Her unhappy illness was owing to her zeal for religion  and to her concealing her struggles Page  174 on that account  She never hinted at marriage in her resveries  She was still solicitous for the SOUL of the man she wished to proselyte  and declared herself ready to lay down her life  could she have effected that favourite wish of her heart  At other times  she supposed my marriage with some other woman  and was only generously solicitous  that it should not be with one who might discredit the regard she herself professed for me  At another time she wished to be acquainted with my sisters  and hoped they would come to Italy  She proposed to perfect them in the Italian tongue  as they should her in the English  But as to me  only bespoke a visit from me now and then  when they came  I have the vanity to think  that I stand high in her favour  But religion  it is evident  as it ought  stands higher  From all these recollections and observations  I have endeavoured to account for the noble behaviour of your sister  and am the less surprised at it  now she is come to her memory  It is all great  all uniform  and most probably we should have been in a very different situation than what we have been long in  had she had her way given her at the time she was so earnest—For what  Only to be allowed a second interview
