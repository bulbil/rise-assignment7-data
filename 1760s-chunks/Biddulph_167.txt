which they are received by all the fashionable people in the county   She knows not of my mother’s death  yet in my answer to her letter  I cannot avoid mentioning it  Though I could wish for obvious reasons to conceal it  Mr Faulkland well knows the ruin of our fortune  and though he cannot suppose while I have a brother living that I am driven to such streights  yet I know what his liberal heart may suggest to him on this occasion  which might lay me under fresh difficulties   I have but just now apprised Lady V—— of the decease of my dear mother  but have not insinuated any other grief than the loss of a tender parent  and an agreeable companion  Indeed I have carried my dissimulation so far as not to desire this lady to change her address to me  lest if I gave her my present direction  she might be led to think  necessity had obliged me to change my former lodgings for worse  I shall use the same precaution towards Mrs Faulkland  as I have obtained permission from the gentlewoman whose house I lately left  to have my letters sent thither  when I go into the country a general direction to the post house may suffice  I shall now look out for some little spot to retire to  where I can support life on the cheapest terms  In two months I shall have my small pittance due to me  which I reserve to carry me out of town  and to settle me in my new scheme of œconomy in the country  If I could persuade my poor Patty to quit me  and see her settled in some eligible situation  I should then have no material concern to attend to  but the bringing up my children in the paths of virtue and humility  Humility  that happy frame of mind  on which so much of our temporal as well as our eternal welfare depends     November 9  Who shall say  now is the measure of my griefs complete  Providence thou canst inflict no more  Oh my sister  in the midst of other sorrows  I thought not of one that still remained behind  my children  my two little angels  both dangerously ill  The small pox is their distemper  and of the worst kind  The disease has been hanging over them for some days  and my close attendance on them  prevented me from using my pen  The cruel distemper now appears with the most malignant symptoms  The eldest always slept with me  I have resigned my bed to her for these three last nights  and have watched by her  Patty has done the same by the youngest  A humane and skilful physician attends them  but my reliance rests not on him   November 12  Three days and nights of sorrowful anxiety have at length produced a little comfort to me  The distemper has now reached one crisis  whence the physician can form a judgment with some degree of certainty  and he bids me hope  Oh if it were not for that healing word  how could the wretched drag on existence from day to day  I do  I will hope  for there is a merciful providence that superintends his works   November 21  Thank God  thank God  my Cecilia  the dear babes are out of danger  Fifteen melancholy days and nights has their disconsolate mother watched by the poor little sufferers  but I am fully repaid by having them restored to my prayers  They are now able to sit up  and open their pretty eyes which had been closed for so many days  and to add to my satisfaction I think they will not be marked  but they are still so feeble that it will be at least another fortnight before I can think of venturing their little tender frames out of doors   The physician’s care and diligence deserved a greater recompence than I had it in my power to make him  however what I have done has reduced me to a single guinea  But this affects me not I shall make no difficulty of parting with some of my now unnecessary fineries  which neither I nor my children probably will ever again have any pretensions to wear     November 22  I have felt the wounds of grief  the pangs of disappointment  and the smart of indignation  yet was my heart never more sensibly affected than it was just now by a circumstance proceeding from a cause very different from all these  I had taken out of my drawers a few superfluous ornaments  which I desired Patty to dispose of as if they were her own  to the woman where we lodge  being things in her own way of business  The poor girl looked at me for some time with a grief in her countenance that pierced me to the soul  There is no need  Madam  said she  with her voice almost stifled  there is no need I hope as yet for this  You don’t consider  Patty  said I  that the children’s weak constitution requires now a more than ordinary attention to their diet  and I have not sufficient to supply them long with such necessaries as they want  I have no occasion for these trifles  and I cannot see my little ones droop for want of such comfortable nourishment as may restore them
