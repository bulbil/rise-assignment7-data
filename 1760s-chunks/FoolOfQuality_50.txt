that a spirit has vast power  Nothing else    in truth  can have any power at alL We perceive  by ourselves   and others  with what ease it can act upon what we call matter     how it moves  how it lifts it  Perhaps  were our spirits detached   from this distempered prison  to which the degeneracy of our   fallen nature has confined them  they might more easily whirl   a mountain through the atmosphere  than they can now cast a   pebble into the air  The consideration of this power  when joined   to malevolence  as is generally the case  becomes very tremendous    The stories told by nurses and gossips about a winter s fire  when   the young auditors crouch closer and closer together  and dare not   look atxmt for fear of what may be behind them  leave impressions   that no subsequent reason or religion can efface  The ideas of   an apparition  on these occasions  are connected with all the horror   of wliich infant imaginations can be susceptible   fangs  horns  a   threatening mien  saucer eyes  a flaming breath  and a deadly   aspect  When children are told of fairies who carry off people to   dwell with them under ground  and of evil spirits who snatch   away soul and body together  to be their associates in regions of   darkness and woe the fear of such evils greatly surpasses those   of death  as it weds misery to existence beyond the grave  On   the contrary side  had spirits been originally represented to infants   as beings of an amiable appearance  and as guardians benevolent   and beneficent to man   had they further deigned to visit us under   such representations  and  had we experienced the advantage of   their instructions and good offices we should have met them with   transport  and have parted with regret     Friend  I observe that  as our female antiquarians drop off  our   faith in spectres perceptibly decays  We have not the fiftieth   story  either propagated or believed  that was credited as gospel   when I was a boy  What think you  is it for  or against religion    that such fables should get footing amongst mankind       Author  I never could think it for the interest of religion  that   the providence of God should be elbowed  as it were  quite out of   the world by a system of demonism  On the other hand  I take   the devil to be a personage of much more prudence than to   frighten his favourites from him  by assuming such horrid and   disgustful appearances  He rather chooses to lurk behind tempta    tion  in the allurement of beauty  the deceitfulness of smiles  the   glozing of compliments  in revel and banqueting  in titles and   honours  in the glitter of ornament  and in the pomp of state    When God sends his spirits on messages to man  there is a mean    ing of importance in the errand  Such was that of his angel to   Manoah  for the delivery of a people   and to Zacharias and the   blessed virgin  for the redemption of human kind  But when the   devil is said to send his emissaries throughout the earth  on what   errands does this arch politician employ them  Even such as   could suit no other than a dunce or a driveller  I never yet heard   of one of these missions that could be construed to any intention         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  19     of cunning or common sense  I therefore hold the legends of his   ghostly visitation to be altogether apocryphal      Friend  Every man of common sense must be of the same opinion    And yet  have you known any person wholly free from such pre    judices  who made no distinction  on this fantastical article  between   darkness and mid day  between a lonely charnel house and a full   assembly       Author  I have   but they were men of exceeding strong nerves    as also of exceeding clear  or exceeding callous consciences  which    coming from opposite points  equally met for the same purpose on   this occasion      Two travellers  the one a man of piety  the other a profligate    met at a country inn just as night came upon them  It was   Hallowtide Eve  the season  in those days  wherein the devil was   said to keep high carnival  and when all the inhabitants of the   visionary regions were supposed to revel and range throughout   the earth at pleasure      For want of better company our travellers made up an acquaint    ance  and further cemented it by a jug of
