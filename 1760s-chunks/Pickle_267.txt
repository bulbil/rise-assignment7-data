this trifling incident  but  very prudently suppressed his displeasure till he returned to his own  house  where his rage co operating with the champagne he had drunk   inflamed him to such a degree of resolution  that he sprang upon the  innocent G    and collared him with great fury  though he was altogether  unconcerned in the cause of his indignation    This extravagant and frantic behaviour  added to other grievances under  which I laboured  hastened my resolution of leaving him  and he  to this  day  blames his relation as the immediate cause of my escape  whereas  he ought to place it to the account of his own madness and indiscretion   When I retired to Park street  he cautioned all my tradesmen  not even  excepting my baker  against giving me credit  assuring them that he  would not pay any debts I should contract  and the difficulties to which  I was reduced  in consequence of this charitable declaration  together  with the reflection of what I had suffered  and might undergo  from the  caprice and barbarity of his disposition  affected my health so much   that I was again taken ill  and my life thought in danger    My constitution  however  got the better of my distemper  and I was  ordered into the country by my physicians  for the benefit of the air   so that I found myself under the necessity of keeping two houses  when  I was little able to support one  and set up my chariot  because I could  not defray the expense of a hackney coach  for I had as much credit  given me as I asked for  notwithstanding my lord s orders to the  contrary    Having recruited my spirits in the country  I returned to town  and  was visited by my friends  who never forsook me in adversity  and in the  summer removed to a house in Essex  where I lived a few months in great  tranquility  unmolested by my tyrant  who sometimes gave me a whole  year s respite  Here I used to ride and drive by turns  as my humour  dictated  with horses which were lent me  and I had the company of my  lover  and another gentleman  who was a very agreeable companion  and of  singular service to me in the sequel    At last  my lord having received intelligence of the place of my abode   and his tormenting humour recurring  he set out for my habitation  and  in the morning appeared in his coach and six  attended by Mr  G    and another person  whom he had engaged for the purpose  with several  domestics armed  I immediately shut up my doors at his approach  and  refused him admittance  which he endeavoured to obtain by a succession  of prayers and threats  but I was deaf to both  and resolved to hold out  to the last  Seeing me determined  he began his attack  and his servants  actually forced their way into the house  upon which I retreated  up stairs  and fortified myself in my apartment  which the assailants  stormed with such fury  that the door began to give way  and I retired  into another room    Whilst I remained in this post  Mr  G   demanded a parley  in which he  begged I would favour my lord with an interview  otherwise he knew not  what might be the consequence  To this remonstrance I replied  that I  was not disposed to comply with his request  and though their  design should be murder  I was not at all afraid of death  Upon this  declaration they renewed their attacks  which they carried on with  indifferent success till the afternoon  when my lord  as if he had been  at play  sent a formal message to me  desiring that all hostilities    6 22 15  3 45 PM   should cease  till after both parties should have dined  At the same  time  my own servants came for instructions  and I ordered them to let  him have everything which he should call for  as far as the house would  afford    He did not fail to make use of this permission  but sitting down with  his companions  ate up my dinner without hesitation  after he had paid  me the compliment of desiring to know what he should send up to my  apartment  Far from having any stomach to partake of his meal  I sat  solitary upon my bed  in a state of melancholy expectation  having  fastened the door of the outward room for my security  while I kept my  chamber open for the convenience of air  the weather being excessively  hot  His lordship  having indulged his appetite  resumed his attempt   and all of a sudden I heard a noise in the next room  upon which I  started up  and perceiving that he had got into my ante chamber  by the  help of a bench that stood under the window  I flung to the door of my  room
