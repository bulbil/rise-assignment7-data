with two servants  and one of her daughters  and rescued me  She had torn my cap—Yet it was a sad   36 thing  you know  madam  to see one s mother put out of the house against her will  And then she raised the neighbourhood  Lord bless me  I thought I should have d•ed  I did fall into fits  Then was Mrs  Lane forced to tell every one what a sad woman my mother was  It was such a disgrace to me —It was a month before I eould go to church  or look any body in the face  But Mrs  Lane s character was of her side  and my guardian s goodness was a help—Shall I say a help against my mother —Poor woman  we heard afterwards  she was dead  but my guardian would not believe it  If it would please God to take me  I should rejoice  Many a tear does my poor mother  and the trouble I give to the best of men  cost me  when nobody sees me  and many a time do I cry myself to sleep  when I think it impossible I should get such a kind relief   I was moved at the dear girl s melancholy tale  I clasped my arms about her  and wept on her gentle bosom  Her calamity  which was the greatest that could happen to a good child  I told her  had endeared her to me  I would love her as my sister   And so I will  Dear child  I will for ever love her  And I am ready to hate myself for some passages in my last letter  O how deceitful is the heart  I could not have thought it possible that mine could have been so narrow   The dear girl rejoiced in my assurances  and prom•sed grateful love to the latest hour of her life   Indeed  madam  I have a grateful heart  said she  for all I am so unhappy in a certain relation  I have none of those sort of faults that give me a resemblance in any way to my poor mother  But how shall I make out what I say  You will mistrust me  I fear  You will be apt to doubt my principles  But will you promise to take my heart in your hand  and guide it as you please —Indeed it is an honest one  I wish you •aw it thro  and thro  —If ever I do a wrong   37 thing  mistrust my head  if you please  but not my heart  But in every thing I will be directed by you  and then my head will be as right as my heart   I told her  that good often resulted from evil  It was an happy thing perhaps for both  that her mother s visit had been made  Look upon me  my dear Emily  as your entire friend  We will have but one heart between us   Let me add  Lucy  that if you find me capable of drawing this sweet girl into consessions of her insant love  and of making ungenerous advantage of them  tho  the event were to be fatal to my peace if I did not  I now call upon all you  my dear friends  to despise and renounce the treacherous friend in Harriet Byron   She besought me to let her write to me  to let her come to me for advice  as often as she wanted it  whether here  in my dressing room or chamber  or at Mr  Reeves s  when I went from Colnebrooke   I consented very chearfully  and at her request  for indeed  said she  I would not be an intruder for the world  promised by a nod at her entrance  to let her know  if she came when I was busy  that she must retire  and come another time   You are too young a Lady  added she  to be called my mamma—Alas  I have never a mamma  you know  But I will love you  and obey you  on the holding up of your finger  as I would my mother  were she as good as you   Does not the beautiful simplicity of this charming girl affect you  Lucy  But her eyes swimming in tears  her earnest looks  her throbbing bosom  her hands now clasped about me  now in one another  added such graces to what she said  that it is impossible to do justice to it  And yet I am affected as I write  but not so much  you may believe  as at the time she told her tender tale   Indeed her calamity has given her an absolute possession   4 of my heart  I  who had such good parents  and have had my loss of them so happily alleviated  and even supplied  by a grandmamma and an aunt so truly maternal  as well as by the love of every one to whom I have the happiness to be related  how unworthy of such blessings should I be  if I did not know how to pity a poor girl who must reckon a living mother as her heaviest misfortune   Sir Charles  from the time of the disturbance which this unhappy woman made
