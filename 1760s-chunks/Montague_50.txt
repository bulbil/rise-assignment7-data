to have had an eye only to the conquest of ours  their whole system of policy seems to have been military  not commercial  or only so far commercial as was necessary to supply the wants  and by so doing to gain the friendship  of the savages  in order to make use of them against us       The lands are held on military tenure  every peasant is a soldier  every seigneur an officer  and both serve without pay whenever called upon  this service is  except a very small quit rent by way of acknowledgement  all they pay for their lands  the seigneur holds of the crown  the peasant of the seigneur  who is at once his lord and commander       The peasants are in general tall and robust  notwithstanding their excessive indolence  they love war  and hate labor  are brave  hardy  alert in the field  but lazy and inactive at home  in which they resemble the savages  whose manners they seem strongly to have imbibed  The government appears to have encouraged a military spirit all over the colony  though ignorant and stupid to a great degree  these peasants have a strong sense of honor  and though they serve  as I have said  without pay  are never so happy as when called to the field       They are excessively vain  and not only look on the French as the only civilized nation in the world  but on themselves as the flower of the French nation  they had  I am told  a great aversion to the regular troops which came from France in the late war  and a contempt equal to that aversion  they however had an affection and esteem for the late Marquis De Montcalm  which almost rose to idolatry  and I have even at this distance of time seen many of them in tears at the mention of his name  an honest tribute to the memory of a commander equally brave and humane  for whom his enemies wept even on the day when their own hero fell       I am called upon for this letter  and have only time to assure your Lordship of my respect  and of the pleasure I always receive from your commands  I have the honor to be        My Lord   Your Lordship s   c   WILLIAM FERMOR     LETTER LXXIII   73   To Miss FERMOR   Feb  24  Eleven at night   I HAVE indeed  my dear  a pleasure in his conversation  to which words cannot do justice  love itself is less tender and lively than my friendship for Rivers  from the first moment I saw him  I lost all taste for other conversation  even yours  amiable as you are  borrows its most prevailing charm from the pleasure of hearing you talk of him       When I call my tenderness for him friendship  I do not mean either to paint myself as an enemy to tenderer sentiments  or him as one whom it is easy to see without feeling them  all I mean is  that  as our situations make it impossible for us to think of each other except as friends  I have endeavored I hope with success to see him in no other light  it is not in his power to marry without fortune  and mine is a trifle  had I worlds  they should be his  but  I am neither so selfish as to desire  nor so romantic as to expect  that he should descend from the rank of life he has been bred in  and live lost to the world with me       As to the impertinence of two or three women  I hear of it with perfect indifference  my dear Rivers esteems me  he approves my conduct  and all else is below my care  the applause of worlds would give me less pleasure than one smile of approbation from him       I am astonished your father should know me so little  as to suppose me capable of being influenced even by you  when I determined to refuse Sir George  it was from the feelings of my own heart alone  the first moment I saw Colonel Rivers convinced me my heart had till then been a stranger to true tenderness  from that moment my life has been one continued struggle between my reason  which shewed me the folly as well as indecency of marrying one man when I so infinitely preferred another  and a false point of honor and mistaken compassion  from which painful state  a concurrence of favorable accidents has at length happily relieved me  and left me free to act as becomes me       Of this  my dear  be assured  that  though I have not the least idea of ever marrying Colonel Rivers  yet  whilst my sentiments for him continue what they are  I will never marry any other man       I am hurt at what Mrs  Melmoth hinted in her letter to you  of Rivers having appeared to attach himself to me from vanity  she endeavors in vain to destroy my esteem for him  you well know  he never did appear to attach himself to me  he is incapable of having done it from such a motive  but if he had  such delight have I in
