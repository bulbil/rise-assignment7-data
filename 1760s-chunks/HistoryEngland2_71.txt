though the war between England and France had actually subsided in Europe  yet in the East and West Indies they still carried on hostile operations  both sides equally culpable  yet each complaining of the infraction   In the mean time  as Europe enjoyed a temporary tranquility  the people of England expected  and the government promised them  a restitution of those blessings which had been taken from them by a long and obstinate war  A magnificent firework was played off upon this occasion  which  though an useless and vain expence  served to amuse the populace  and render them more contented with the late precarious treaty   The ministry also shewed some desire to promote the commerce of the kingdom  and  for this purpose  a bill was passed for encouraging a British herring fishery  under proper regulations  From such a scheme carried into execution  great advantages were expected to accrue  the Dutch  who had long enoyed the sole profits arising from it  considered the ea as a mine of inexhaustible wealth  However  xperience has shewn that the English were either ncapable of turning this fishery to the same adantage  or that their company was not established ith the most strict oeconomy  Private persons have ften been found to make fortunes by this fishery    192 but the company have found themselves considerabl losers   A scheme  which  by many  was thought still mor advantageous to the nation  was  the encouragin those who had been discharged the army or navy  t become members of a new colony in North America called Nova Scotia  To this retreat  it was thought the waste of an exuberant nation might well be drain¦ed off  and here those free spirits might be kep employed  who  if suffered to remain at home  would only prey upon the community  This was a cold climate  and a barren soil  where the English had a fort  and a small garrison  rather to intimidate the neighbouring French  and repress their incroachments  than to derive any advantages from the improvement of trade  or the cultivation of the country  It was here that a scheme was laid for the foundation of a new colony  which might improve the fishery upon that coast  and become a new source of wealth to the mother country  Thus did the nation exchange her hardy and veteran troops for the expectation of precarious wealth  Every colony taken from the parent country serves to lessen its strength  and all the wealth imported into it  after it has become moderately rich  being only used as the instrument of luxury  instead of invigorating the nation  tends to render it more effeminate   However  it was advertised by authority  that all proper encouragement would be given to such officers and private men  who  being discharged from the service of the government  should be willing to settle in Nova Scotia  Fifty acres of land were granted to every private soldier or seaman  free from taxes for ten years  and then to pay only one shilling a year  Besides this fifty  ten acres more were to be granted to every individual of which each family should consist  Every officer  under the rank of ensign  was to have fourscore acres  ensigns were to   193 have two hundred  lieutenants three  captains four  and those above that rank six  Such offers failed not to induce numbers to try their fortunes on that desolate coast  and  in a little time  about four thousand adventurers  with their families  were carried thither  a town named Halifax was built  and the colonists left to glean a scanty subsistance from an ungrateful soil  Since that time  notwithstanding all the encouragement this colony has received from the government  the inhabitants have cleared but a very small part of the woods with which the face of the country is covered  Agriculture is quite forsaken  and the settlement intirely subsists by the sums expended by the army and navy stationed in this part of the western world   Here those voluntary out casts of their country expected to live  though hardly  yet at least securely  but  in this they found themselves disappointed  The Indians  a savage and fierce people  from the first looked upon these settlements of the English as an incroachment upon their own liberties  and the French  who were equally jealous  fomented these outrages  Commissaries were therefore appointed to meet at Paris  and compromise these disputes  but these conferences were rendered abortive by mutual cavillings  and all the arts
