on him  and knowing him to be absolutely in his father s power  as to fortune  gave way to Sir Harry s addresses  and on her obtaining such terms as  in a great measure  put both father and son in her power  she married Sir Harry   She soon gained an absolute ascendant over her husband  The son  when his father first made his addresses to her  was allowed to set out on his travels with an appointment of 600 l  a year  She never rested till she had got 400 l  a year to be struck off  and the remaining 200 were so ill remitted  that the young gentleman would have been put to the greatest difficulties  had it not been for the truly friendly assistance of Mr  Grandison   Yet it is said  that this Lady is not destitute of some good qualities  and in cases where the son is not the subject  behaves very commendably to Sir Harry  But being a managing woman  and Sir Harry loving his ease  she has made herself his receiver and treasurer  and by that means has put it out of his power  to act as paternally by his son as he is inclined to do  without her knowing it   The Lady and Sir Harry both  however  profess to admire the character of Sir Charles Grandison  from the Letters Mr  Beauchamp has written from time to time to his father  and from the general report in his favour  And on th•s  as well I  as Mr  Beauchamp  found our hope  that if Sir Charles  by some unsuspected way  can make himself personally acquainted   356 with the Lady  he will be able to induce her to consent to her son in law s recall  and to be reconciled to him  the rather  as there is no issue by this marriage  whose interests might strengthen the Lady s animosity   Mr  Beauchamp  in this hope  writes to Sir Charles  that he can  and will  pay all the due respect to his father s wife  and  as such  treat her as his mother  if she will consent to his return to his native country  But declares  that he would stay abroad all his life  rather than his father should be made unhappy  by allowing of his coming over against the consent of so high spirited a woman  In the mean time he proposes to set out from Vienna  where he now is  for Paris  to be near  if Sir Charles  who he thinks can manage any point he undertakes  and who in this  will be seconded by his father s love  can prevail with his mother in law   I long  Ladies  to have you all acquainted with this other excellent young man  You  Miss Byron  I am sure  in particular  will admire Sir Charles Grandison s  and my Beauchamp  Of spirit so manly  yet of manners so delicate—I end as I began  He is a second Sir Charles Grandison   I shall think myself  Ladies  very happy  if I can find it in my power to oblige you  by any communications you would wish to be made you  But let me once more recommend it to you  Lady L  Lord L  and Miss Grandison  to throw off all reserves to the most affectionate of brothers  He will have none to you  in cases which he knows will give you pleasure  And if he forbears of his own accord to acquaint you withs ome certain affairs  it is  because the issue of them is yet hidden from himself   As to Lady Olivia  mentioned to you by good Lord L  she never can be more to my patron than she now is     357 Allow me to be  my good Miss Byron  with a true paternal affection   Your admirer and humble servant  AMBROSE BARTLETT   Subjoined in a separate paper  by Miss BYRON to her LUCY    HOW is this Lucy  Let me collect some of the contents of these Letters   If Sir Charles forbear  of his own accord  to acquaint his sisters with some certain affairs— Issue hidden from himself    Engaged in some affairs at Bologna and Florence  that embarrass him — Is  or was so engaged  means the Doctor    Sir Charles not reserved  yet reserved  —How is all this  Lucy   But does the Doctor say   That I shall particularly admire Mr  Beauchamp  —What means the Doctor by that —But he cannot affront me so much as to mean any thing but to shew his own love to the worthy young man  The Doctor longs for us to see him  If I do see him  he must come quickly  For shall I not soon return to my last  my best refuge  the arms of my indulgent grandmamma and aunt —I shall   But  dear Lucy  have you any spite in you  Are you capable of malice—deadly malice —If you are  sit down  and wish the person you hate  to be in Love with a man  I must  it seems  speak out  whom she think  and every body knows
