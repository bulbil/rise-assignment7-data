reassured by Sir Charles  Such creatures have all their tricks  Harriet   You  Charlotte  are not favourable to sinners  and hardly to saints  But pray proceed   Why  he re assured the woman  as I told you  And then proceeded to ask many questions of the elder Oldham—I pitied that young fellow—to have a mother in his eye  whose very tenderness to the young ones kept alive the sense of her guilt  And yet what would she have been  had she not been doubly tender to the innocents  who were born to shame from her fault  The young man acknowleged a military genius  and Sir Charles told him  that he would  on his return from a journey he was going to take  consider whether he could not do him service in the way he chose  He gave him  it seems  a brief lecture on what he should aim to be  and what avoid  to qualify himself for a man of true honour  and spoke very handsomely of such gentlemen of the army as are real gentlemen  The young fellow  continued Miss Granddison  may look upon himself to be as good as provided for  since my brother never gives the most distant hope that is not followed by absolute certainty  the first opportunity  not that offers  but which he can make   He took great notice of the little boys  He dilated   70 their hearts  and set them a prating  and was pleased with their prate  The doctor  who had never seen him before in the company of children  applauded him for his vivacity and condescending talk to them  The tenderest father in the world  he said  could not have behaved more tenderly  or shewed himself more delighted with his own children  than he did with those brats of Mrs  Oldham   Ah  Charlotte  And is it out of doubt  that you are the Daughter of Lady Grandison  and sister of Sir Charles Grandison —Well  but I believe you are—Some children take after the father  some after the mother —Forgive me  my dear   But I won t  I have a great mind to quarrel with you  Harriet   Pray don t  because I could neither help  nor can be sorry for  what I said  But pray proceed   Why he made presents to the children  I don t know what they were  nor could the doctor tell me  I suppose very handsome ones  for he has the spirit of a prince  He enquired very particularly after the circumstances of the mother  and was more kind to her than many people would be to their own mothers —He can account for this  I suppose —tho  I cannot  The woman  it is true  is of a good family  and so forth  But that enhances her crime  Natural children abound in the present age  Keeping is fashionable  Good men should not countenance such wretches —But my brother and you are charitable creatures —With all my heart  child  Virtue  however  has at least as much to say on one side of the question as on the other   When the poor children are in the world  as your brother said—When the poor women are penitents  true penitents—Your brother s treatment of Mrs  Giffard was different  He is in both instances an imitator of the Almighty  an humbler of the impenitent  and an encourager of those who repent     71 Well  well  He is undoubtedly a good sort of young man  and  Harriet  you are a good sort of young woman  Where much is given  much is required  But I have not given me such a large quantity of charity  as either of you may bo•st  And how can I help it —But  however  the woman went away blessing and praising him  and that  the doctor says  more with her eyes than she was able to do in words  The elder youth departed in rapturous reverence  The children hung about his knees  on theirs  The doctor will have it  that it was without bidding—Perhaps so—He raised them by turns to his arms  and kissed them —Why  Harriet  Your eyes glisten  child  They would ha•e run over  I suppose  had you been there  Is it  that your heart is weakened with your present situation  I hope not  No  you are a good creature  And I see that the mention of a behaviour greatly generous  however slightly made  will have its force upon a heart so truly benevolent as yours  You must be Lady Grandison  my dear  Indeed you must —Well  but I must be gone  You dine with us to morrow  my brother says   He did ask me  and desired me to engage my cousins  But he repeated not the invitation when he went away   He depends upon your coming  And so do we  He is to t•lk to me before you  it seems  I can t tell about what  But by his hurrying on every thing  it is plain he is preparing to leave us   He is  madam      He is  madam    And with that dejected air
