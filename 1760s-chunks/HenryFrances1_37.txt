plain Sense  meerly to amuse your own Jeu d Esprit  In your second Letter  you misunderstand me greatly  nay  seem to forget intirely the gossipping Affair — But you are sick  and I am sorry   Adeiu     120  LETTER LXXI   My dear FANNY   I RECEIVED yours this Morning  and do assure you  without Compliment  that it wanted nothing  but your being in the Right  to be the best wrote Letter I ever read  I commend every Thing  but the Injustice of it  like a certain Exile from Athens  who could not forbear applauding  and repeating to Strangers  an Oration of Demosthenes  by which the Wretch was banished  The Cause of many of our Quarrels has been owing  as at present  to your never considering any Thing  but the Matter before you  When you receive my Letters  you find some Things to displease you  but never recollect your own  which gave the Provocation  You wrote me lately two of the most mortifying Letters  which could be well imagined  and now seem surprized I should resent them  Consider that the Height of our Picques is  always  in Proportion to our Love  and  if — had charged me with all the cruel Things you did  I should not have offended her  by any Reply  inconsistent with the natural Complaisance I have for even the most disagreeable of your Sex  You say several Things  which when I require an Explanation of  you cut me   121 short  by answering me  you was only in Jest  These Things are certainly inconsistent  at least  and surely  if you had reflected the least on them  when you say    you so strictly examined your whole Conduct   I am persuaded  you would have been generous  and ingenuous enough to acknowledge  I had good Reason to be provoked at being puzzled by contradictory Appearances  and jested with  in Matters  which both mortified and alarmed me  I confess indeed  that I have many Faults  but do not  my Dear  so vainly acquit yourself of any     I realy think you have many valuable Qualities  and a great Number of agreeable ones  and I have been always endeavouring to screen them  from some irregular Flights  and romantick Whims  which are  by no Means  any Ornament to your Understanding  I was but acting the good Farmer s Part  and winnowing the Chaff  from among the Wheat  for  could I but rid you of a few light Errors  I think you need not the Addition of one Merit  to make you perfect  I have therefore  on many Occasions  restrained and disguised my Love and Tenderness for you  like a cautious Parent  lest it should but increase those irregular Whims  and romantick Dreams  which I have often wished out of your charming Composition  My Actions  I think  kept on still one constant Tenor  and always shall  because my Principles   122 are in my own Power  my Expressions and Manners indeed often varied  as your Behaviour affected them  because my Passions are in your Power  you can increase  or abate my Fondness  but it is not in the Power of the rest of the World  or  what is more  even of yourself  to alter the obstinate and determined Purpose of my Actions towards you  for where  as I have Reason to apprehend  from the strong Hints  you gave me in your last Letter  the Poverty of my Nature  and Ungenerousness of my Principles  shall leave me weak for so good a Work  I will even borrow the Semblance of those Virtues  which may best assist me  to acquit myself  as a Man of Honour  to you    So shall Dissemblage once be virtuous in me     I confess that the Manner of my Invitation to — had not all the Decorum  it should have had  at another Time  but consider the Mortifications and Picque  I laboured under just then  from your Letters and Behaviour  and it will convince you of the Truth of what I have just said  that your Actions cannot lessen my Kindness  tho  they may destroy my Complaisance   Farewel   Henry     123  LETTER LXXII   Dear FANNY   LAST Post I received a Letter from —  the Answer of which he desires may be inclosed to you  because  he says  you know where to direct to him  From which Hint I gather two Things  both equally disagreeable to me  that you correspond with him  and that he still knows you write to me  and you know  it was without my Consent or Approbation  that he was  at first  let into the Secret  That either of these Things gives me Offence  my dear Fanny  proceeds plainly from an high Sense of Honour  and a generous Regard for you  If I could basely indulge a Vanity of this Kind  I do not know any Thing could answer the End so well  as the letting your Correspondence with me be publicly known  That it was not  as I find now  a particular Favour to me
