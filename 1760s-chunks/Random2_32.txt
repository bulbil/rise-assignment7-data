as well as truth  in censuring your native country —If the ministry have thought fit to lay you aside  I suppose they have their own reasons for so doing  and you ought to remember that you still live on the bounty of this nation —As for these gentlemen   meaning the prince and ambassador  who make so free with our constitution  laws and genius of our people  I think they might shew a little more respect for their benefactors  who  I must own  are to blame in harbouring  protecting and encouraging such ungrateful vagrants as they are  —  At these words the chevalier in green started up in a great passion  and laying his hand on the hilt of his hanger  exclaimed    Ha  foutre  —  The Englishman on the other hand  grasping his cane  cried    Don t foutre me  sirrah  or by G—d  I ll knock you down  —  The company interposed  the Frenchman sat down again  and his antagonist proceeded—   Lookee  monsieur  you know very well  that had you   89 dared to speak so freely of the administration of your own country in Paris  as you have done of ours in London  you would have been sent to the Bastile without ceremony  where you might have rotted in a dungeon  and never seen the light of the sun again —Now  Sir  take my word for it  although our constitution screens us from such oppression  we want not laws to chastise the authors of seditious discourse  and if I hear another syllable out of your mouth  in contempt or prejudice of this kingdom  I will give you a convincing proof of what I advance  and have you laid by the heels for your presumption  —  This declaration had an effect on the company  as sudden as surprizing —The young prince became supple as a spaniel  the ambassador trembled  the general sat silent and abashed  and the doctor  who  it seems  had felt the rod of power  grew pale as death  and assured us all  that he had no intention to affront any person or people —   Your principles  doctor   resumed the old gentleman  are no secret—I have nothing to say upon that head  but am very much surprized  that a man who despises us so much  should notwithstanding live among us  when he has no visible motive for so doing —Why don t you take up your habitation in your beloved France  where you may rail at England without censure  —  To this the doctor thought proper to make no reply  and an unsocial silence ensued  which I perceiving  took notice  that it was pity such idle disputes  maintained very often for whim or diversion  should create any misunderstanding among gentlemen of good sense  and proposed to drink down all animosity in another bottle —This motion   90 was applauded by the whole company  The wine was brought  and the English champion declaring he had no spleen against any man for differing in opinion from him  any more than for difference of complexion  drank to the good health of all present  the compliment was returned  and the conversation once more became unreserved  though more general than before —Among other topicks  the subject of war was introduced  on which the general declaimed with great eloquence  recounting many of his own exploits by way of illustration —In the course of his harrangue he happened to mention the word epaulement  upon which the testy gentleman asked the meaning of that term —   I ll tell you what an epaulement is   replied he —I never saw an epaulement but once—and that was at the siege of Namur—in a council of war  monsieur Cohorn  the famous engineer  affirmed that the place could not be taken —  Yes   said the prince of Vaudemont  it may be taken by an epaulement  —   This was immediately put in execution  and in twenty fourhours Mareschal Boufflers was fain to capitulate  —  Here he made a full stop  and the old gentleman repeated the question    But pray what is an epaulement  —  To this the officer made no immediate reply  but rung the bell and called for a bill  which being brought  he threw down his proportion of the reckoning  and telling the company  he would shew them what an epaulement is  when his Majesty thought fit to entrust him with the command of our army abroad  strutted away with great dignity —I could not imagine why he was so shy of explaining one of the most simple terms of fortification  which I   91 forthwith described as a side work composed of earth  gabions  or faschins  but I was very much surprized when I afterwards understood that his reserve proceeded from his ignorance —Having paid our bill  we adjourned to the coffee room  where my fellow labourer insisted on treating me with a dish  giving me to understand at the same time  that I had acquired his good opinion  both with respect to my principles and intellects —I thanked him for his compliment  and professing myself an utter stranger in this part of the world  begged he would have the goodness to inform me of the quality and characters of the people who dined
