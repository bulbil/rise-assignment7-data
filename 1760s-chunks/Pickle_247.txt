Lord B    in Wiltshire  whither I was followed  by this pretender to my heart  who visited us on the footing of an  acquaintance  but when I reflected on what I had done  I condemned my  own conduct as indiscreet  though nothing decisive had passed between  us  and began to hate him in proportion to the self conviction I felt   perceiving that I had involved myself in a difficulty from which I  should not be easily disengaged  For the present  however  I found means  to postpone my declaration  He admitted my excuse  and I returned to  London with Lord B    who was again summoned to the field by his former  challenger    H  d  n  governor  counsellor  and steward to this little hero  came to  Lord B   with a verbal message  importing that his lordship had changed  his mind about going to Flanders  but expected to meet him  on such    6 22 15  3 45 PM   a day and hour  in the burying ground near Red Lion square  Lord B    accepted the challenge  and gave me an account of what had passed  but  he had been anticipated by the messenger  who had already tried to alarm  my fears from the consideration of the consequence  that I might take  some measures to prevent their meeting  I perceived his drift  and told  him plainly  that Lord      had no intention to risk his person  though  he endeavoured with all his might to persuade me  that his principal was  desperate and determined  I knew my little husband too well to think  he would bring matters to any dangerous issue  and was apprehensive of  nothing but foul play  from the villainy of H  d  n  with which I was  equally well acquainted  Indeed  I signified my doubts on that score to  Mr  B    who would have attended his kinsman to the field  had he not  thought he might be liable to censure  if anything should happen to Lord  B    because he himself was heir at law  for that reason he judiciously  declined being personally concerned  and we pitched upon the earl of  A    his lordship s uncle  who willingly undertook the office    At the appointed time they went to the house of rendezvous  where they  had not waited long when the challenger appeared  in a new pink satin  waistcoat  which he had put on for the occasion  with his sword under  his arm  and his steward by him  leaving  in a hackney coach at some  distance  a surgeon whom he had provided for the care of his person   Thus equipped he advanced to his antagonist  and desired him to choose  his ground  upon which Lord B   told him  that if he must fall  it was  not material which grave he should tumble over    Our little hero  finding him so jocose and determined  turned to  Lord A    and desired to speak with him  that he might disburden his  conscience before they should begin the work of death  They accordingly  went aside  and he gave him to understand  that his motive for fighting   was Lord B   s detaining his wife from him by compulsion  The earl of  A   assured him  he was egregiously mistaken in his conjecture  that his  nephew used no force or undue influence to keep me in his house  but it  could not be expected that he would turn me out of doors    This explanation was altogether satisfactory to Lord     who said he  was far from being so unreasonable as to expect Lord B   would commit  such a breach of hospitality  and all he desired was  that his wife  should be left to her own inclinations  Upon these articles  peace was  concluded  and they parted without bloodshed  At least these are the  particulars of the story  as they were related by Lord A    with whom  I laughed heartily at the adventure  for I never doubted that the  challenger would find some expedient to prevent the duel  though I  wondered how he mustered up resolution enough to carry it so far    That he might not  however  give us any more trouble  we resolved to  go and enjoy ourselves in France  whither I went by myself  in hopes of  being soon joined by my lover  who was obliged to stay some time longer  in England  to settle his affairs  He was so much affected at our  parting  though but for a few weeks  that he was almost distracted   And this affliction renewed my tenderness for him  because it was an  undoubted proof of his love  I wrote to him every post from France  and   as I had no secrets  desired him to take care of all the letters that  should come to his house  directed to me  after my departure from
