into the public market  and sold there at the usual rate of Christian cattle  What Mahomet had foretold to me on ship board was completely verified  my condition was exactly to my mind  I was not consigned to the stronghold of a prison  nor kept to any works of oppressive labour  My indulgent master stationed me in a particular quarter  with five or six slaves of superior rank  who were in momentary expectation of being ransomed  and were therefore favoured in the distribution of our tasks  The care of watering the orange trees and flowers in the gardens was allotted as my portion  There could not be a more agreeable or less fatiguing employment   Soliman was a man about forty years of age  well made as to figure  tolerably accomplished as to his mind  and as much of a lady s man as could be expected from a Turk  His favourite was a Cashmirian  whose wit and beauty had acquired an absolute dominion over his affections  He loved her even to idolatry  Not a day but he paid his court to her by some elegant entertainment  at one time a concert of vocal and instrumental music  at another  a dramatic performance after the fashion of the Turks  which fashion implies a loose sort of comedy  where moral and modesty enter about as much into the contemplation of the contriver  as do Aristotle and his unities  The favourite  whose name was Farrukhnaz  was passionately enamoured of these exhibitions  she sometimes even got up among her own women some Arabian melodramas to be performed before her admirer  She took some of the parts herself  and charmed the spectators by the abundant grace and vivacity of her action  One day when I was among the musicians at one of these representations  Soliman ordered me to play on the guitar  and to sing a solo between the acts of the piece  I had the good fortune to give satisfaction  and was received with applause  The favourite herself  if my vanity did not mislead me  cast glances towards me of no unfavourable interpretation   On the next day  as I was watering the orange trees in the gardens  there passed close by me an eunuch  who  without stopping or saying a word  threw down a note at my feet  I picked it up with an emotion  strangely compounded of pleasure and alarm  I crouched upon the ground  for fear of being observed from the windows of the seraglio  and  concealing myself behind the boxes in which the orange trees were planted  opened this unexpected enclosure  There I found a diamond of very considerable value  and these words  in genuine Castilian   Young Christian  return thanks to heaven for your captivity  Love and fortune will render it the harbinger of your bliss  love  if you are alive to the attractions of a fine person  and fortune  if you have the hardihood to confront danger in every direction    I could not for a moment doubt that the letter was written by the favourite sultana  the style and the diamond were more than presumptive evidence against her  Besides that nature did not cast me in the mould of a coward  the vanity of keeping up a good understanding with the mistress of a scoundrelly Mahometan in office  and  more than all the temptations of vanity or inclination  the hope of cajoling her out of four times as much as the curmudgeon her master would demand for my ransom  put me into conceit with  the intention of trying my luck at a venture  whatever risk might be incurred in the experiment  I went on with my gardening  but always harping on the means of getting into the apartment of Farrukhnaz  or rather waiting till she opened a door of communication  for I was clearly of opinion that she would not stop upon the threshold  but meet me half way in the career of love and danger  My conjecture was not altogether without foundation  The same eunuch who had led me into this amorous reverie passed the same way an hour afterwards  and said to me  Christian  have you communed with your own determinations  and will you win a fair lady  by abjuring a faint heart  I answered in the affirmative  Well  then  rejoined he  heaven sprinkle its dew upon your resolutions  You shall see me betimes to morrow morning  With this comfortable assurance  he withdrew  The following day  I actually saw him make his appearance about eight o clock in the morning  He made a signal for me to go along with him  I obeyed the summons  and he conducted me into a hall where was a large wrapper of canvas which he and another eunuch had just brought thither  with the design of carrying it to the sultana s apartment  for the purpose of furnishing a scene for an Arabian pantomime  in preparation for the amusement of the bashaw   The two eunuchs unrolled the cloth  and laid me at my length on the proscenium  then  at the risk of turning the farce into a tragedy by stifling me  they rolled it up again  with its palpitating contents  In the next place  taking hold of it at each end  they conveyed me with impunity by this device into the chamber devoted to the repose of the
