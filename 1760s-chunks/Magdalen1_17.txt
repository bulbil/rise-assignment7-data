no necessity however  Sir Robert  for running to so poor  so unmanly an artifice—If you are in the least desirous of avoiding a match with a wretch  whose partiality for yourself has alone rendered her culpable  be generous and tell her so—She is not yet so utterly lost to sentiment  as to sollicit for your compassion  since it seems she is to be no longer entitled to your love       101Dear madam  replied I  moderate a little of this unnecessary warmth  What cause  what ground have I given you for these unaccountable suppositions    Sir Robert   interrupted she    it is not altogether so easy to blind the eagle eyed inspection of a vehement love—What cause  what ground have you given me for these unaccountable suppositions —The most ample cause  the most indubitable ground —When I came down this morning  did not your eye industriously avoid mine —and all the time of breakfast did not you officiously force your conversation on my father to avoid saying a syllable to me —When we were left alone  instead of entertaining me as you used to do—did not you sit a whole hour without ever opening your lips  and when in the fulness of my heart I took notice of this indifference  did   102 not you then come out with your dear madams  your profound venerations  and your everlasting esteems  Nay  at this moment  when you see my poor bosom bursting with the most poignant distress at your behaviour  have you not the same unimpassioned countenance  the same air of unconcern  and the same cutting distance of civility  which first of all gave birth to my suspicions  as if you triumphed in your power  and were desirous of seeing how far the abuse of it was able to plunge me in distress      Upon my word Miss Mildmay   replied I    you put a very strange interpretation upon looks—and I am infinitely sorry that any unfortunate disposition of my features should give you the smallest uneasiness—I did not  however  imagine that the use of a becoming   103 respect could be construed into an offence—     Respect —Respect   exclaimed she  with a wildness of look and elevation of tone  that really startled me    Respect —God give me patience—Inhuman Harold—and do you think that a woman doating like me to distraction  can ever put up with a cold unanimated respect where she has a right to demand the warmest returns of a passionate love —Respect  after what has passed between you and I  is the grossest of all insults—and if you have nothing else to offer me—I scorn both you and your respect—and here in the presence of the living God  I solemnly swear never to be your s  but will rather undergo any load of infamy and misfortune  than give my hand to a man  who  after having blasted my peace of mind for ever  under the specious   104 appearance of the most vehement passion  shall in a few hours let me see I am so much lessened in his estimation as to talk of treating me with politeness and respect —Go Sir Robert Harold  continued she in a gentler accent  but with a faltering tone   go leave me—instantly—I here give you back all your vows and protestations—and shall only say that you have eternally destroyed the happiness of a poor girl  who would die for the preservation of your s   —here the storm found way  for unable any longer to suppress her emotion  she threw herself into a great chair  and gave way to a violent flood of tears     All this time  Melmoth  if you do me justice  you must be sensible that my distress fell little short of Miss Mildmays—You know I have not naturally an obdurate heart  however reason and   105 reflection may on particular occasions oblige me to resist its emotions—Judge therefore what I must have felt  to see the woman of my soul tortured in a manner  to madness  with the coldness of my behaviour  yet to see also an absolute occasion for continuing that coldness  nay an absolute occasion of giving her up for ever—A thousand times was I ready to throw myself at her feet  and solicit a reconciliation —My love  joined to my humanity  pleaded the propriety of such a proceeding in terms the most forcible  but my reason and my pride stept constantly in to my assistance  and convinced me that the anguish of a separation at that time  was infinitely preferable to a whole life of despicable jealousy  and aching discontent—As well for the poor girl s sake as my own  I saw the indispensable necessity of persevering in my plan  and  as the dignity of her sentiments   106 had made a parting considerably more easy than I could expect  I exerted all my fortitude to oppose the remonstrances of my love  being fully convinced that to lose the present opportunity would only render a breach more difficult another time  if any other time could even supply me with so fair an occasion to break off   Miss Mildmay had no sooner thrown herself into the chair  than good manners necessarily obliged me to console her as well as I was able  I mean consistently with my design  I went therefore  to the side of the chair  and taking
