causes  Mr  Staple   judged not that Miss Betsy refused to ease his jealous apprehensions on   the score of Mr  Trueworth  because it was her natural temper to give   pain to those that loved her  but because she really had an affection   for that gentleman  Looking on himself  therefore  as now abandoned to   all hope  rage and revenge took the whole possession of his soul  and   chased away the softer emotions thence       Having heard Mr  Trueworth say he lodged in Pall Mall  he went to the   Cocoa Tree  and there informing himself of the particular house where   his rival might be found  sat down and wrote the following billet             To Charles Trueworth  Esq            Sir            Both our wishes tend to the possession of one beautiful object         both cannot be happy in the accomplishment  it is fit  therefore         the sword should decide the difference between us  and put an end        to those pretensions on the one side or the other  which it is not        probable either of us will otherwise recede from  In confidence of        your complying with this proposal  I shall attend you in the Green        Park  between the hours of seven and eight to morrow morning  As        the affair concerns only ourselves  I think it both needless and        unjust to engage any of our friends in it  so shall come alone  and        expect you will do the same to  Sir  your humble servant            T  STAPLE        Mr  Trueworth was at home  and  on receiving this  immediately  and   without the least hesitation  wrote and sent back  by the same   messenger  the following answer             To T  Staple  Esq            Sir            Though I cannot but think the decision of our fate ought to be left        entirely to the lady herself   to whom  whatever be the fortune of        the sword  it must at last be referred  yet  as I cannot  without        being guilty of injustice to my own honour and pretensions  refuse        you the satisfaction you require  shall not fail to meet you at the        time and place mentioned in yours  till when  I am  Sir  your        humble servant            C  TRUEWORTH        By the stile of this letter  it may be easily perceived that Mr    Trueworth was not very well pleased with this combat  though the   greatness of his courage and spirit would not permit him to harbour the   least thought of avoiding it  yet  whatever his thoughts were on this   occasion  he visited Miss Betsy the same day  and discovered no part of   them in his countenance  his behaviour  on the contrary  was rather more   sprightly than usual  He proposed to the two young ladies to go on some   party of pleasure  Miss Betsy replied  with her accustomed freedom  that   she should like it very well  but Miss Flora  who had been for three or   four days past very sullen and ill humoured  said one minute she would   go  and the next that she would not  and gave herself such odd and   capricious airs  that Miss Betsy told her she believed her head was   turned  to which the other replied  tartly  that if the distemper was   catching  it would be no wonder she should be infected  having it always   so near her  Miss Betsy replied  that she knew no greater proof of   madness than to punish one s self in the hope of mortifying another     But that shall never be my case   continued she   as you will find     Then turning to Mr  Trueworth   If you will accept of my company    without Miss Flora   said she  laughing   we will take a walk into the   Park   It is not to be doubted but that the lover gladly embraced this   opportunity of having his mistress to himself   It is like Miss Betsy   Thoughtless   cried Miss Flora
