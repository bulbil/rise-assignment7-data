into a greater degree of politeness than it had before enjoyed  The coins of this period are better struck than those of preceding Princes  The marine  in his time  seems first to have given rise to our claims to the ocean  In short  from this period  English history may properly be said to commence  and our constitution to take its rise  We are connected with the events previous to Alfred s reign  only by motives of curiosity  but  with those that follow him  by the more prevailing inducements of interest   This great man died in the year 900  in the 52d year of his age  after a reign of more than twenty eight years  the first part spent in war and distress  the latter in peace and prosperity   I am   c     43  LETTER VIII   Dear Child   HISTORIANS and critics are fond of representing the period which succeeded Alfred  as entirely barbarous  yet  there are many traces of both erudition and politeness  in those very ages which have been particularly called obscure  In the reign of his successor  Edward  we find gallantry  which is one of the best marks of politeness in any country  not entirely unknown  his amours with Egwina  who  though by birth a shepherd s daughter  received an education becoming a princess  and  at length  subdued the heart of Edward  is a remarkable instance of the power the fair sex then enjoyed  In this reign too  the university of Cambridge was founded  The famous Scotus flourished at this time  a man whose learning appears amazing  even to an age which prides itself upon its erudition   In the reign of Athelstan  who succeeded Edward  the Bible was translated into Saxon  a work which at once evinces a just opinion  with regard to religion and the learning of that age  Alliances also on the continent were formed by this Monarch  it is said he was equally feared by his neighbours  and loved by the greatest Princes of Europe  We find little remarkable in the reign of Edmund I  but that the first capital punishment was instituted by him  He had remarked  that fines and pecuniary punishments were too gentle methods of treating those who were convicted of robberies  who generally were men who had nothing to lose  he therefore ordered  that  in gangs of robbers  the oldest of them should be condemned to the gallows    44 This was reckoned a very severe law at the time it was instituted  What would our ancestors say  upon seeing the penal laws now used by their posterity   The death of this Monarch is too remarkable to be passed without notice  His virtues  abilities  wealth  and temperance  promised a long and happy reign  when  on a certain day  as he was solemnizing a festival in Gloucestershire  he saw a malefactor  whose name was Leolf   who had been banished the kingdom for his crimes  sitting at one of the tables in the hall where the King was at dinner  Enraged at such insolence  he commanded him to be apprehended  but  perceiving him drawing his dagger  in order to defend himself  the King started up in a rage  and  catching him by the hair  dragged him out of the hall  In the mean time Leolf had now drawn out the dagger  and  lifting his arm  with a furious blow stabbed the Monarch to the heart  who fell down on the bosom of his murderer   The Danes  during these three reigns  were kept within proper bounds  they frequently revolted  were subdued  and treated with lenity by the conquerors  The Monks now began to have the direction of affairs  and  consequently  to enfeeble the state   Edred succeeded Edmund  and began his reign with some victories over the Scotch and Danes  which the Monks were skilful enough to attribute to the miraculous interposition of Heaven  Among the number  Dunstan  Abbot of Glastonbury  had peculiar influence over the mind of the credulous Monarch  and  at length  became the director of the affairs of the kingdom  By this means the Monks acquired such power  as served to retard   45 the vigour of every future operation against the Danes  However  what they took from the real strength of their country they returned in appellations of honour and respect  Edred was styled  Monarch of Albion  and King of Great Britain  and this at a period when his monarchy was upon the very verge o ruin   The sons of Edred were set aside  and Edwy  his elder brother s son  was placed on the throne  At this time the crown appears to have been elective  and those elections entirely influenced by the clergy  The Secular priesthood seems to have placed the crown upon this Monarch s head  in opposition to the Monks  who were then rising into esteem among the people  Thus were the English divided by religious disputes  and involved in all the fury of civil war  while the Danes were every hour growing in strength  and sending over fresh forces  The Seculars were possessed of the riches of the country  but the Monks  who opposed them  were in possession
