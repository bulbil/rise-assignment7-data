dared to tamper with that stubborn dame    Mother Earth  without being bred to the manner      However  if he wasted much money  he wasted it honourably   and usefully    Vast sums of money must have passed through his   hands   says one reporter in Brookiana  But they passed at least   into the pockete of the starving Irish  in the form not only of alms    which he gave but too lavishly and carelessly  but of employment    of new cottages  new gardens  and a general increase of civiliza    tion  physical and moral  No doubt  his dreams were wider than   his success    Would you believe   asks one    that Henry Brooke   would quit the sweet vales of Daisy Park  to pass the evening of   his life at the foot of a barren mountain in Corfoddy  or Longfield    as he calls it  in the wildest part of the county  Yet he is as   philosophical as poetical  and as cheerful as ever  He was bom   in a desert  and to a desert he has returned  And yet in his   imagination  he has already ploughed the one half of the land     sprinkled the country all round with snug cottages   already he   thinks he hears the clack of the busy mill  and the sound of the   anvil  To do him justice  however  he has already built a house   of lime and stone  two stories high  with glass windows too  which   never fail to attract the gaze and admiration of the solitary   passenger       The secret charm of Longfield was  perhaps  that it was his own     but there is many a man in Ireland and elsewhere who would   have rested in the mere sense of possession  without considering               PREFACE  li     himself bound to live on his own estate  But perhaps Brooke was   too conscientious  as well as too kind hearted a man  to leave the   wild Irish of Corfoddy to shift for themselves  and so  though the   place could not but be a sad and humbling one to him  for only   half a mile oif was the old   House of Rantavan   where he was   born  now passed into other hands  he would go and live and die   among his own people  and see what could be done for them   and   not altogether in vain  to judge from another report written some   ten years later         When I came within six or seven miles of Mr  Brooke s  I was   afraid I should mistake the way in such a wild part of the county    so that I asked almost every one I met  man  woman  and child     Is this the way to Corfoddy   Every one knew Mr  Brooke    every one praised him  and wished he might live for ever       As I knew that the author of Gustavus Vasa had written a   great deal in praise of agriculture  I expected of course  as I   approached his house  that it would be bosomed high in tufted   trees   a most Irish expectation  seeing that the said house had   only been built a dozen years           But I was never so   disappointed in my life not a tree on the whole road  not a hedge   to be seen  and the way so bad  that I am sure it must be im    passable in the winter  His house stands on a barren spot  and   the only improvement I could see  a little garden in the front    shaded with a few half starved elms  that seem rather to have been   planted by chance than design   This hardly agrees with the   account of the Dublin University Magazine  that the roofless ruins   of his labourers  cottages still stand  and that his hydraulic works   were at one time so extensive  as to frighten the millers on the   Blackwater into a deputation to Lord Headfort  entreating that   Mr  Brooke might not turn the course of the whole river  to   which Lord Headfort answered    That they had nothing to fear   from Mr  Brooke  That he should be sorry to meddle with that   gentleman   The disappointed tourist  however  finds hospitality   and an excellent libraiy  and at last Mr  and Mrs  Brooke  His   sketch of the old man has been already given  the child  wife  alas    worn out by bearing and losing children  is quite emaciated  and   so feeble she can hardly walk across the room
