 But you must love her better than any other woman  the best of mothers excepted  She is my wife  and your sister  and she loves both you  and our dear Jeronymo   And no body else  Does she love no body else   Whom else would you have her love   I don t know  But every body  I think  for I do   Whomever you love  she will love  She is all goodness   Why that s well  I will love her  now I know who she is  But  Sir  I have some notion—  Of what  my dear   I don t know  But pray  Sir  What brings the Chevalier over hither again   To comfort you  your father  mother  Jeronymo  To comfort us all  To make us all well  and happy in each other   Why that s very good  Don t you think so  But he was always good  Are you  brother  happy   I am  and should be more so  if you and Jeronymo were   But that can never  never be   God forbid  my sister  The Chevalier has brought over with him a skilful man  who hopes to cure our Jeronymo—  Page  15 Has the Chevalier done this  Why did he not do so before   The General was a little disconcerted  but generously said  We were wrong  we took not right methods  I  for my part  wish we had followed his advice in every thing   Bless me —holding up one hand  How came all these things about  Sir  Sir  with quickness—I will come again presently—And was making to the door   Camilla stept to her—Whither  whither  my dear young Lady —O  Camilla will do as well—Camilla  laying her hand upon her shoulder  go to Father Marescotti—Tell him—There she stopt  Then proceeding  Tell him  I have seen a vision—He shall pray for us all   Then stepping to her mother  and taking her passive hand  she kissed it  and stroked her own forehead and cheek with it—Love me  madam  love your child  You don t know  neither do I  what ails my poor head  Heal it  Heal it  with your gentle hand  Again stroking her forehead with it  then putting it to her heart   The Marchioness  kissing her forehead  made her face wet with her tears   Shall I  said Camilla  go to Father Marescotti   No  said the General  except she repeats her commands  Perhaps she has forgot him already —She said no more of Father Marescotti   The Marchioness thinks that she had some confused notions of the former enmity of the General and Father to me  and finding the former reconciled  wanted the Father to be so too  and to pray for us all   I was willing  my dear Dr  Bartlett  to give you minutely the workings of the poor Lady s mind on our two first interviews  Every body is rejoiced at so hopeful an alteration already   We all thought it best  now  that she had so surprisingly taken a turn  from observing a profound Page  16 silence  to free talking  and shewn herself able  with very little incoherence  to pursue a discourse  that she should not exhaust herself  and Camilla was directed to court her into her own dressing room  and endeavour to engage her on some indifferent subjects  I asked her leave to withdraw  She gave it me readily  with these words  I shall see you again  I hope  before you go to England   Often  I hope  very often  answered the General for me   That is very good  said she  and  courtesying to me  went up with Camilla   We all went into Jeronymo s apartment  and the young Marchioness rejoiced him with the relation of what had passed  That generous friend was for ascribing to my presence the hoped for happy alteration  while the General declared  that he never would have her contradicted for the future  in any reasonable request she should make   The Count her uncle  and Signor Sebastiano his eldest Son  are set out for Urbino  They took leave of me at my lodgings  He hoped  he said  that all would be happy  and that I would be a Catholic   I HAVE received a large pacquet of Letters from England   I approve of all you propose  my dear Dr  Bartlett  You shall not  you say  be easy  except I will inspect your accounts  Don t refuse to give your own worthy heart any satisfaction that it can receive  by consulting your true friend  But otherwise  you need not ask my consent to any thing you shall think sit to do  Of one thing  methinks  I could be glad  that only such children of the poor  as shew a peculiar ingenuity  have any great pains taken with them in their books  Husbandry and labour are what are most wanting to be encouraged among the lower class of people  Providence has given to men different genius s and Page  17 capacities
