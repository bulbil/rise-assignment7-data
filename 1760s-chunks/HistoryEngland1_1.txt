              AN HISTORY OF ENGLAND  IN A SERIES of LETTERS FROM A NOBLEMAN to his SON   VOL  I   Nec minimum meruere decus  vestigia Graeca  Ausi deserere    celebrare domestica facta     HOR   LONDON  Printed for J  NEWBERY  at the Bible and Sun  in St  Paul s Church Yard  MDCCLXIV      unnumbered   TO THE PUBLISHER   SIR   AS I perceive by the tenor of your publications  that you chiefly aim at the improvement of youth  if the following Letters are thought any way conducive to that purpose  you have my permission to print them   The first fifty one letters ending with these words   —avenged them of their enemies—  were written by a Nobleman to his son  at the university  The rest are added  as you will easily perceive  by a much inferior hand  for they were drawn up by me  This I should not have attempted  but that the design would otherwise have been defective  With regard to my letrers  therefore  little else can be said  but that I have endeavoured  as much as was in my power  to imitate the original  As to his Lordship s  I think it may be asserted  that they are written with more judgment  spirit  and accuracy than any which have yet appeared upon this subject  I am conscious  indeed  that they have been  for some time  handed about in manuscript  but  it is presumed that this will not make a publication of them less acceptable  even to those who are possessed of a written copy     I have observed in the schools about town  that  when masters set their scholars to read the history of England  they seem at a loss in   2 their choice of an historian  The more voluminous works of this kind are quite unsuited to a juvenile capacity  the shorter abridgments are chiefly a crouded collection of facts  totally dry and unentertaining  These letters may  probably  supply the defect  and I desire that the volumes may be sent  at my expence  to each of the schools mentioned in the inclosed paper   I am  SIR  Your s  c      unnumbered THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND  IN A SERIES of LETTERS   LETTER I   Dear Charles   THE accounts I receive from Mr  your tutor  at Oxford  of your conduct and capacity  give me equal pleasure  both as a father and as a man  I own myself happy  in thinking that society will one day reap the advantage of your improved abilities  but I confess myself vain when I reflect on the care I have taken  and the honour I shall perhaps obtain from assisting their cultivation    2 Yes  my Charles  self interest thus mixes with almost every virtue  my paternal vanity is  perhaps  greater than my regards for society in the present instance  but you should consider that the bad pride themselves in their folly  but good minds alone are vain of their virtues   I need scarcely repeat what I have so often observed  that your assiduity for a few years  in the early period of life  will give ease and happiness to the succeeding  a life spent in regularity and study  in college  will not only furnish the mind with proper materials  but fit it  by habit  for future felicity  Mathematics will teach you to think with closeness and precision  and the ancient poets will enlarge the imagination  from these two helps  and not from the subtleties of logic or metaphysical speculation  the mind is at once strengthened and improved  logic or metaphysics may give the theory of reasoning  but it is poetry and mathematics  though seemingly opposite  that practically improve us in every rational enquiry   These were the studies I recommended as principally conducive to your improvement  and your letters alone are sufficient instances of your complying with my advice  I confess I fear giving any future instructions on such topics to one who seems better conversant with them than his instructor  and must leave a subject  where my superiority at least may be contested   But after all  my child  these studies are at best but ornaments of the mind  designed rather to polish or to fit it for higher improvements  than as materials to be employed in guiding our conduct as individuals  or members of society  There is a field that  in some measure  still lies untrodden before you  and from that alone true wisdom and   3 real improvement can be expected  I mean history  from history  in a great measure  every advantage that improves the gentleman  or confirms the patriot  can be hoped for  it is that which must qualify you for becoming a proper member of the community  for filling that station  in which you may hereafter be placed  with honour  and for giving  as well as deriving  new lustre from that illustrious assembly  to which  upon my decease  you have a right to be called   Yet  still  nothing can be more useless than history  in
