observed her when we entered the room  she blushed  she turned pale  she trembled  her voice faltered  every look spoke the strong emotion of her soul       She is paler than when I saw her last  she is  I think  less beautiful  but more touching than ever  there is a languor in her air  a softness in her countenance  which are the genuine marks of a heart in love  all the tenderness of her soul is in her eyes       Shall I own to you all my injustice  I hate this man for having the happiness to please her  I cannot even behave to him with the politeness due to every gentleman       I begin to fear my weakness is greater than I supposed   22d in the evening       I am certainly mad  Lucy  what right have I to expect  you will scarce believe the excess of my folly  I went after dinner to Major Melmoth s  I found Emily at piquet with Sir George  can you conceive that I fancied myself ill used  that I scarce spoke to her  and returned immediately home  though strongly pressed to spend the evening there  I walked two or three times about my room  took my hat  and went to visit the handsomest Frenchwoman at Montreal  whose windows are directly opposite to Major Melmoth s  in the excess of my anger  I asked this lady to dance with me to morrow at a little ball we are to have out of town  Can you imagine any behaviour more childish  It would have been scarce pardonable at sixteen       Adieu  my letter is called for  I will write to you again in a few days   Yours   ED  RIVERS       Major Melmoth tells me  they are to be married in a month at Quebec  and to embark immediately for England  I will not be there  I cannot bear to see her devote herself to wretchedness  she will be the most unhappy of her sex with this man  I see clearly into his character  his virtue is the meer absence of vice  his good qualities are all of the negative kind     LETTER XIX   19   To Miss FERMOR  at Silleri   Montreal  Sept  24   I HAVE but a moment  my dear  to acknowledge your last  this week has been a continual hurry       You mistake me  it is not the romantic passion of fifteen I wish to feel  but that tender lively friendship which alone can give charms to so intimate an union as that of marriage  I wish a greater conformity in our characters  in our sentiments  in our tastes       But I will say no more on this subject till I have the pleasure of seeing you at Silleri  Mrs  Melmoth and I come in a ship which sails in a day or two  they tell us  it is the most agreeable way of coming  Colonel Rivers is so polite  as to stay to accompany us down  Major Melmoth asked Sir George  but he preferred the pleasure of parading into Quebec  and shewing his fine horses and fine person to advantage  to that of attending his mistress  shall I own to you that I am hurt at this instance of his neglect  as I know his attendance on the general was not expected  His situation was more than a sufficient excuse  it was highly improper for two women to go to Quebec alone  it is in some degree so that any other man should accompany me at this time  my pride is extremely wounded  I expect a thousand times more attention from him since his acquisition of fortune  it is with pain I tell you  my dear friend  he seems to shew me much less  I will not descend to suppose he presumes on this increase of fortune  but he presumes on the inclination he supposes I have for him  an inclination  however  not violent enough to make me submit to the least ill treatment from him       In my present state of mind  I am extremely hard to please  either his behaviour or my temper have suffered a change  I know not how it is  but I see his faults in a much stronger light than I have ever seen them before  I am alarmed at the coldness of his disposition  so ill suited to the sensibility of mine  I begin to doubt his being of the amiable character I once supposed  in short  I begin to doubt of the possibility of his making me happy       You will  perhaps  call it an excess of pride  when I say  I am much less inclined to marry him than when our situations were equal  I certainly love him  I have a habit of considering him as the man I am to marry  but my affection is not of that kind which will make me easy under the sense of an obligation        I will open all my heart to you when we meet  I am not so happy as you imagine  do not accuse me of caprice  can I be too cautious  where the happiness of my whole life is at stake       Adieu
