 be present  asked if his heart was not otherwise engaged  Tom  who did  not conceive the meaning of the question  stood silent according to  custom  and the interrogation being repeated  answered  with a grin    Heart whole as a biscuit  I ll assure you  mistress     What   said  Emilia   have you never been in love  Thomas     Yes  forsooth   replied    6 22 15  3 45 PM   the valet without hesitation   sometimes of a morning    Peregrine could not help laughing  and his mistress looked a little  disconcerted at this blunt repartee  while Sophy  slipping a purse  into his hand  told him there was something to purchase a periwig  Tom   having consulted his master s eyes  refused the present  saying   No   thank ye as much as if I did   and though she insisted upon his putting  it in his pocket  as a small testimony of her gratitude  he could not be  prevailed upon to avail himself of her generosity  but following her to  the other end of the room  thrust it into her sleeve without ceremony   exclaiming   I ll be d  d to hell if I do   Peregrine  having checked  him for his boorish behaviour  sent him out of the room  and begged that  Miss Sophy would not endeavour to debauch the morals of his servant   who  rough and uncultivated as he was  had sense enough to perceive that  he had no pretension to any such acknowledgment  But she argued  with  great vehemence  that she should never be able to make acknowledgment  adequate to the service he had done her  and that she should never  be perfectly easy in her own mind until she found some opportunity of  manifesting the sense she had of the obligation   I do not pretend    said she   to reward Mr  Pipes  but I shall be absolutely unhappy   unless I am allowed to give him some token of my regard    Peregrine  thus earnestly solicited  desired  that since she was bent  upon displaying her generosity  she would not bestow upon him any  pecuniary gratification  but honour him with some trinket  as a mark of  consideration  because he himself had such a particular value for the  fellow  on account of his attachment and fidelity  that he should be  sorry to see him treated on the footing of a common mercenary domestic   There was not one jewel in the possession of this grateful young lady   that she would not have gladly given as a recompense  or badge of  distinction  to her rescuer  but his master pitched upon a seal ring of  no great value that hung at her watch  and Pipes  being called in  had  permission to accept that testimony of Miss Sophy s favour  Tom received  it accordingly with sundry scrapes  and  having kissed it with great  devotion  put it on his little finger  and strutted off  extremely proud  of his acquisition   Emilia  with a most enchanting sweetness of aspect  told her lover that  he had instructed her how to behave towards him  and taking a diamond  ring from her finger  desired he would wear it for her sake  He received  the pledge as became him  and presented another in exchange  which  she at first refused  alleging that it would destroy the intent of her  acknowledgment  but Peregrine assured her he had accepted her jewel  not  as a proof of her gratitude  but as the mark of her love  and that if  she refused a mutual token  he should look upon himself as the object of  her disdain  Her eyes kindled  and her cheeks glowed with resentment  at this impudent intimation  which she considered as an unseasonable  insult  and the young gentleman  perceiving her emotion  stood corrected  for his temerity  and asked pardon for the liberty of his remonstrance   which he hoped she would ascribe to the prevalence of that principle  alone  which he had always taken pride in avowing   Sophy  seeing him disconcerted  interposed in his behalf  and chid her  cousin for having practised such unnecessary affectation  upon which   Emilia  softened into compliance  held out her finger as a signal of  her condescension  Peregrine put on the ring with great eagerness  and  mumbled her soft white hand in an ecstasy which would not allow him to    6 22 15  3 45 PM   confine his embraces to that limb  but urged him to seize her by the  waist  and snatch a delicious kiss from her love pouting lips  nor  would he leave her a butt to the ridicule of Sophy  on whose mouth he  instantly committed a rape of the same nature  so that the two friends   countenanced by each other  reprehended him with such gentleness of  rebuke  that he was almost tempted to repeat the offence   The morning being now lighted up  and the servants of
