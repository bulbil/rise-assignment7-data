to the mob on a holiday  Yet the ceremony did not end here  for every great Lord of the court was to be visited in the same manner  and their ladies  who took the whim from their husbands  were all equally fond of seeing the strangers perform  even the children seeming highly diverted with the dancing Dutchmen   Alas  cried I  to myself  upon returning from such a spectacle  is this the nation which assumes such dignity at the court of Pekin  Is this that people that appear so proud at home  and in every country where they have the least authority  How does a love of gain transform the gravest of mankind into the most contemptible and ridiculous  I had rather continue poor all my life  than become rich at such a rate Perish those riches which are acquired at the expence of my honour or my humanity  Let me quit  said I  a country where there are none but such as treat all others like slaves  and more detestible still  in suffering such treatment  I have seen enough of this nation to desire to see more of others  Let me leave a people suspicious to excess  whose morals are corrupted  and equally debased by superstition and vice  where the sciences are left uncultivated  where the Great are slaves to the Prince  and tyrants to the people  where the women are chaste   216 only when debarred of the power of transgression  where the true disciples of Confucius are not less persecuted than those of Christianity  in a word  a country where men are forbidden to think  and consequently labour under the most miserable slavery  that of mental servitude   Adieu   LETTER CXVI  To the same   THE misfortunes of the great  my friend  are held up to engage our attention  are enlarged upon in tones of declamation  and the world is called upon to gaze at the noble sufferers  they have at once the comfort of admiration and pity   Yet where is the magnanimity of bearing misfortunes when the whole world is looking on  Men in such circumstances can act bravely even from motives of vanity  He only who  in the vale of obscurity  can brave adversity  who without friends to encourage  acquaintances to pity  or even without hope to alleviate his distresses  can behave with tranquility and indifference  is truly great  whether peasant or courtier  he deserves admiration  and should be held up for our imitation and respect   The miseries of the poor are however entirely disregarded  tho  some undergo more real hardships in one day  than the great in their whole lives  It is indeed inconceiveable what difficulties   217 the meanest English sailor or soldier endures without murmuring or regret  Every day is to him a day of misery  and yet he bears his hard fate without repining   With what indignation do I hear the heroes of tragedy complain of misfortunes and hardships  whose greatest calamity is founded in arrogance and pride  Their severest distresses are pleasures  compared to what many of the adventuring poor every day sustain  without murmuring  These may eat  drink  and sleep  have slaves to attend them  and are sure of subsistence for life  while many of their fellow creatures are obliged to wander  without a friend to comfort or to assist them  find enmity in every law  and are too poor to obtain even justice   I have been led into these reflections from accidentally meeting some days ago a poor fellow begging at one of the outlets of this town  with a wooden leg  I was curious to learn what had reduced him to his present situation  and after giving him what I thought proper  desired to know the history of his life and misfortunes  and the manner in which he was reduced to his present distress  The disabled soldier  for such he was  with an intrepidity truly British  leaning on his crutch  put himself into an attitude to comply with my request  and gave me his history as follows   As for misfortunes  Sir  I can t pretend to have gone through more than others  Except the loss of my limb  and my being obliged to beg  I don t know any reason  thank heaven  that I have to complain  there are some who have lost   218 both legs  and an eye  but  thank heaven  it is not quite so bad with me   My father was a labourer in the country  and died when I was five years old  so I was put upon the parish  As he had been a wandering sort of a man  the parishioners were not able to tell to what parish I belonged  or where I was born  so they sent me to another parish  and that parish sent me to a third  till at last it was thought I belonged to no parish at all  At length  however  they fixed me  I had some disposition to be a scholar  and had actually learned my letters  but the master of the workhouse put me to business as soon as I was able to handle a mallet   Here I lived an easy kind of a life for five years  I only wrought ten hours in the day
