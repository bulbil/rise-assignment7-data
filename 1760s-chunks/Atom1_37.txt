  207 being annihilated  He therefore assembled all those among the Bonzes who had the reputation of being great philosophers and metaphysicians  in order to hear their opinions concerning the nature of the soul  The first reverend sage who delivered himself on this mysterious subject  having stroked his grey beard  and hemmed thrice with great solemnity  declared that the soul was an animal  a second pronounced it to be the number three  or proportion  a third contended for the number seven  or harmony  a fourth defined the soul the universe  a fifth affirmed it was a mixture of elements  a sixth asserted it was composed of fire  a seventh opined it was formed of water  an eighth called it an essence  a ninth  an idea  a tenth stickled for substance without extension  an eleventh  for extension without substance  a twelfth cried it    208 was an accident  a thirteenth called it a reflecting mirrour  a fourteenth  the image reflected  a fifteenth insisted upon its being a tune  a sixteenth believed it was the instrument that played the tune  a seventeenth undertook to prove it was material  an eighteenth exclaimed it was immaterial  a nineteenth allowed it was something  and a twentieth swore it was nothing —By this time all the individuals that composed this learned assembly  spoke together with equal eagerness and vociferation  The volubility with which a great number of abstruse and unintelligible terms and definitions were pronounced and repeated  not only resembled the confusion of Babel  but they had just the same effect upon the brain of Fika kaka  as is generally produced in weak heads by looking stedfastly at a millwheel or a vortex  or any other object    209 in continual rotation  He grew giddy  ran three times round  and dropped down in the midst of the Bonzes  deprived of sense and motion  When he recovered so far as to be able to reflect upon what had happened  he was greatly disturbed with the terror of annihilation  as he had heard nothing said in the consultation which could give him any reason to believe there was such a thing as an immortal soul  In this emergency he sent for his counsellor Mura clami  and when that lawyer entered his chamber  exclaimed    My dear Mura  as I have a soul to be saved —A soul to be saved —ay  there s the rub —the devil a soul have I —Those Bonzes are good for nothing but to kiss my a—se —a parcel of ignorant asses —Pox on their philosophy  Instead of demonstrating the immortality of the soul  they have plainly    210 proved the soul is a chimaera  a will o  the wisp  a bubble  a term  a word  a nothing —My dear Mura  prove but that I have a soul  and I shall be contented to be damned to all eternity  — If that be the case   said the other  your Quambucuship may set your heart at rest  for  if you proceed to govern this empire  in conjunction with Taycho  as you have begun  it will become a point of eternal justice to give you an immortal soul  if you have not one already  that you may undergo eternal punishment  according to your demerits    The Cuboy was much comforted by this assurance  and returned to his former occupations with redoubled ardour  He continued to confer benefices on his back friends the Bonzes  to regulate the whole army of taxgatherers  to bribe the tribunes  the centurions  the decuriones  and all the inferior mob drivers of the    211 empire  to hire those pipers who were best skilled in making the multitude dance  and find out the ablest artists to scratch their long ears  and tickle their noses  These toils were sweetened by a variety of enjoyments  He possessed all the pomp of oftentation  the vanity of levees  the pride of power  the pleasure of adulation  the happiness of being kicked by his sovereign and kissed by his Bonzes  and  above all  the delights of the stomach and the close stool  which recurred in perpetual succession  and which he seemed to enjoy with a particular relish  for  it must be observed  to the honour of Fika kaka  that what he eagerly received at one end  he as liberally refunded at the other  But as the faculties of his mind were insufficient to digest the great mess of power which had fallen to his share  so were the organs of his body unable to concoct the    212 enormous mass of aliments which he so greedily swallowed  He laboured under an indigestion of both  and the vague promises which went upwards  as well as the murmurs that passed the other way  were no other than eruptive crudities arising from the defects of his soul and body     As for Taycho  he confined himself to the management of the war  He recalled the general in chief from Fatsisio  because he had not done that which he could not possibly do  but  instead of sending another on whose abilities he could depend  he allowed the direction of the armaments to devolve upon the second in command  whose character he could not possibly know  because  indeed  he was too obscure to have any character at all
