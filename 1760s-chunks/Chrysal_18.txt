shrewd   observations on the common fallacies of conduct  Of at    torneys  he says for instance  the very name of whose pro    fession had become a reproach    such is the perverseness of   man  that if a child betrays an early propensity to chicane   and fraud  by setting his playfellows together by the ears    and cozening them of their toys  he is immediately marked   for this profession  and instead of being corrected for such   a disposition  and having it nipped in the bud  is encouraged   in it  by having it made the omen and ground of his future   success in life  till it is confirmed beyond the sense of shame   and remorse  and becomes the ruling principle of his life      Like a contemporary work  The Fool of Quality  published in   this series  Chrysal contains numerous anticipations of future   reforms  many of them yet in the remote distance  showing   the author to have been a far sighted thinker  He pleads for         INTRODUCTION xxxi     a fairer education for women  who  he says  are prevented    from   rising to that excellence  the want of which is objected   to them    mainly by the disadvantages due to a wrong system   of training and instruction  In politics he pleads for   One   man one vote    absolute freedom of election  and parliaments    lasting for only one session  so as to keep perfectly in touch   with their constituents  He has wise words on duelling  and   countless other abuses of his own and later times  That he   was no self deceiver as to the effective worth of his satire    and in spite of his atrabilious disposition  was well aware of   his own foibles  is witnessed by the observation he puts in   the mouth of one of his characters  It is       A task that will give you the pleasing opportunity of indulging    that misanthropy which inspires the muse of a satirist  and is   mistaken for virtue  because it rails against vice   for  blazon it out   as pompously as you will  nothing but ill nature can make a man   take delight in exposing the defects of others   and the more forcibly   he does it  the more powerful must that principle be with him        With which caveat he may be left to the reader      E  A  B          PREFACE     To acquit myself of the suspicion of presuming to aim  at   particular characters in the following work  should any fancied   likeness be thought to direct an application  as well as to do   justice to the real author of it  I think it my duty to make   known the manner by which it happened to come into my   hands      As I was walking one morning  last summer  along White    ohapel  I was obliged to take shelter from a shower of rain   in a cottage near the turnpike  The family were at breakfast    at their tea  and  as the rain continued  I had leisure to reflect   on the advantages of commerce  which thus  in a manner  joins   the opposite extremities of the earth  by bringing their pro    ducts together   at the same time  that the variety in the   â  equi of the tea table  or indeed stool  on which   there   was nothing of a piece     suggested a just ridicule on the vanity   â  of luxury      This last reflection was extended to all the pursuits of man    â€¢on the sight of a piece of written paper  that served instead   â€¢of a plate to hold their butter    Who knows    thought I    â    but the writer of this bestowed time and care upon it  and   promised himself both profit and fame  in reward of his   labour         This thought raised a curiosity to look at the paper  which    by this time  was scraped quite clean  I  therefore  after a   few words of conversation  to introduce my request  desired   leave to see it  which was readily granted  when I was sur    prised to find my conjecture  as I imagined  confirmed  by its   appearing to be part of some regular work      Curiosity had now a stronger motive than idle gratification     I asked where they had got that paper   and on their telling   me at the chandler s shop next door  though this discouraged   me a good deal
