 Mr  Barker  the father  is the most bearable man I have seen in this country  and the daughters vastly above the stile of the misses here  Lady Belmont intends to take them this winter with her to town           2 35       as she does  every year  some gentleman s daughter in her neighbourhood      Adieu  I am peevish beyond measure  and scarce know what I would be at  Have you never these kinds of feels  Never fretful  you cannot tell why  It is well for you  you are not here  a lover and a favourite lap dog have a dreadful life on these occasions  or indeed any animal one can use ill with impunity  Strangely severe to day  do not you perceive it     Six o Clock      Ten thousand times more peevish than ever  we have just had a visit from  the best kind of woman in the world   and her daughter   an amiable and accomplished young lady   who writes verses and journals  paints  makes shell flowers  cuts paper  and has  every qualification to render the marriage state happy            2 36       talks of the charms of rural retirement  the pleasures of reflexion  the beauties of the mind  and sings   Love s a gentle generous passion   It was not in nature to have stood it a quarter of an hour  Heaven be praised  the play hour is come  and the coaches are at the door   Eleven o Clock      We have seen them enact Juliet and Romeo  Lady Julia seemed to sympathize with the heroine        I ll not wed Paris  Romeo is my husband   Buona Notte          2 37         To Colonel Bellville      WE have been all extremely busy today  celebrating a harvest home  a long procession of our village youths  all drest gaily in fine shirts  adorned with ribbands  paired with the handsomest of the country girls  in white jackets and petticoats  garlands of flowers and wheat ears on their heads  their rakes streaming with various coloured ribbands  which glittered in the sun beams  preceded the harvest cart  on which  in a bower of green boughs  stood a beautiful little girl  drest in the rural stile  with inimitable elegance  by the hands of Lady Julia herself  The gay procession walked slowly through the village  a tabor and pipe playing before them  till they came before the house  where they danced a thousand little rustic dances  the novelty of which charmed me extremely           2 38       they then adjourned to the hall  where a plentiful feast was provided  and where the whole village were that night my Lord s guests      Lord Belmont is extremely fond of all these old customs  and will suffer none of them to be left off on his estate  The prospect of this festivity  he says  chears them in their labor  and is a laudable tribute of gladness to that beneficent Being  to whose bounty we owe the full reward of our toil  the plenteous harvest  and who rejoices in the happiness of his creatures        Besides  says my Lord  all these amusements encourage a spirit of matrimony  and encrease the number of my people        And pray  my dear Lord  to they encourage no other spirit            2 39          No  Madam  Lady Belmont s anger and mine would  in such a case  they know  contrary to that of the world  fall chiefly where it ought  on the seducer  who would be for ever expelled my estate  the heaviest punishment I could possibly inflict  Then  as I am a declared enemy to interested marriages  the young people are allowed to chuse for themselves  which removes the temptation to vice  which is generally caused by the shameful avarice of parents        Our example too is of great service  and allures them to a regular behaviour  they think that must be the happiest life  which we  who have the power of chusing  prefer  and therefore it is the fashion amongst them to be regular  and seek their happiness  as we do  at home        I believe my Lord is right  I am well pleased too  he throws the blame on you he wretches  and excuses the poor lasses           2 40       In the eye of the world it is to be sure  toute au contraire   but my Lord and Lady Belmont are so singular as to see with their own eyes      Adieu  We are all to go
