the madman of Seville  recorded by Cervantes     183 The individuals thus inflated were seen swaggering about the streets  smooth and round  and sleek and jolly  with leering eyes and florid complexion  Every one seemed to have the os magna sonaturum  He strutted with an air of importance  He broke wind  and broached new systems  He declared as if by revelation  that the more debt the public owed  the richer it became  that food was not necessary to the support of life  nor an intercourse of the sexes required for the propagation of the species  He expatiated on yeast  as the nectar of the gods  that would sustain the animal machine  fill the human mind with divine inspiration  and confer immortality  From the efficacy of this specific  he began to prophesy concerning the White Horse  and declared himself an apostle of Bupo —Thus they strolled through the    184 island of Niphon  barking and preaching the gospel of Fakku basi  and presenting their barm goblets to all who were in quest of political salvation  The people had been so well prepared for infatuation  by the speeches of Taycho  and the tidings of success from Tartary  that every passenger greedily swallowed the drench  and in a little time the whole nation was converted  that is  they were totally freed from those troublesome and impertinent faculties of reason and reflection  which could have served no other purpose but to make them miserable under the burthens to which their backs were now subjected  They offered up all their gold and silver  their jewels  their furniture and apparel  at the shrine of Fakkubasi  singing psalms and hymns in praise of the White Horse  They put arms into the hands of their children  and drove them into Tartary     185 in order to fatten the land of Yesso with their blood  They grew fanatics in that cause  and worshipped Brut an tiffi  as the favourite prophet of the beatified Bupo  All was staggering  staring  incoherence and contortion  exclamation and eructation  Still this was no more than a temporary delirium  which might vanish as the intoxicating effects of the yeast subsided  Taycho  therefore  called in two reinforcements to the drench  He resolved to satiate their appetite for blood  and to amuse their infantine vanity with the gew gaws of triumph  He equipped out one armament at a considerable expence to make a descent on the coast of China  and sent another at a much greater  to fight the enemy in Fatsisio  The commander of the first disembarked upon a desolate island  demolished an unfinished cottage  and brought away a few bunches of    186 wild grapes  He afterwards hovered on the Chinese coast  but was deterred from landing by a very singular phaenomenon  In surveying the shore  through spying glasses  he perceived the whole beach instantaneously fortified  as it were  with parapets of sand  which had escaped the naked eye  and at one particular part  there appeared a body of giants with very hideous features  peeping  as it were  from behind those parapets  from which circumstances the Japonese general concluded there was a very formidable ambuscade  which he thought it would be madness to encounter  and even folly to ascertain  One would imagine he had seen Homer s account of the Cyclops  and did not think himself safe  even at the distance of some miles from the shore  for he pressed the commander of the Fune to weigh anchor immediately  and retire to a    187 place of more safety —I shall now  Peacock  let you into the whole secret  This great officer was deceived by the carelessness of the commissary  who  instead of perspectives  had furnished him with glasses peculiar to Japan  that magnified and multiplied objects at the same time  They are called Pho beron tia —The large parapets of sand were a couple of mole hills  and the gigantic faces of grim aspect  were the posteriors of an old woman sacrificing sub dio  to the powers of digestion —There was another circumstance which tended to the miscarriage of this favourite expedition —The principal design was against a trading town  situated on a navigable river  and at the place where this river disembogued itself into the sea  there was a Chinese fort called Sarouf  The admiral of the Fune sent the second in command  whose name    188 was Sel uon  to lay this fort in ashes  that the embarkation might pass without let or molestation  A Chinese pilot offered to bring his junk within a cable length of the walls  but he trusted to the light of his own penetration  He ran his junk aground  and solemnly declared there was not water sufficient to float any vessel of force  within three miles of Sa rouf  This discovery he had made by sounding  and it proved two very surprising paradoxes  first  that the Chinese junks drew little or no water  otherwise they could not have arrived at the town where they were laid up  secondly  that the fort Sa rouf was raised in a spot where it neither could offend  nor be offended  But the Sey seo gun Sel uon was a mighty man for paradoxes  His superior in command  was a plain man  who did not understand these niceties  he
