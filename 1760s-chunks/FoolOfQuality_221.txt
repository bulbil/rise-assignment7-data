order to make   poor Mr  Vindex merry  When I found that it would not do Mr    Vindex  said I  be so kind as to let me know what the money may   come to for which you are confined  A terrible sum  indeed  my   darling  said he   no less than a hundred and fifty two pounds  I   then put my hand in my pocket  and taking out two bills and a   little matter of money that made up the sum  I put it into his   hand  saying  My friend shall never lie in jail for such a trifle   as this      Having looked for some time at the bills with amazement  he turned   to my tutor with a doubtful and shamed face Is this young gentle    man  sir  said he  duly authorized to dispose of such vast matters as   these   He is  says Mr  Clement   he is the carver and disposer of   his father s fortune at pleasure   and I am confident that his father   will think himself doubly paid  in the use that his noble son has   made of his privilege this day      A gleam then  like that of sunshine  broke through his sad   countenance  as through the clouds of a dark day  And are you   the one  he cried are you the one  Master Harry  whom I treated   so barbarously   You may forgive me  my little cherubim   you   indeed may forgive me   but I never I never shall forgive myself    O Mr  Vindex   said I  I would very nearly undergo the same   whipping again to do you twice the kindness  and make you love   me twice as much as you now love me          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  229     Dinner was now served  and  calling for wine  I filled him a   bumper in a large glass  which he drank to the health of my   glorious dada  as he called you  sir  Upon this we grew very   merry and friendly among one another  and  when dinner was   over  I begged him to tell me how he came to be put into con    finement      O  Master Harry  he cried  I have suffered all that I have   suffered very justly very justly  for my harsh and cruel usage of   you  Master Harry      After the affair of the hobgoblins  as you know  the shame to   which I was put by my fright and by my scourging began to be whis    pered  and then to be noised about the town  The boys at length   catched the rumour  and began to hoot at me   and the more I   chastised them the more they gathered about me  and shouted   after me A rod for the fiogger   a rod for the flogger       No disease is so deadly  no blasting so baneful  as contemprt to a   man in the way of his profession  My boys grew disorderly  and   behaved themselves in school without respect to my person  or   regard to my government  Even my intimates shunned me  and   would cast at me a side glance of smiling scorn as they passed    My school then melted from me like snow in a fog  Even my   boarders forsook me  I stood at a high rent  my effects were   seized by the landlord  It was in vain that I solicited payment   from the parents of my scholars  No one who was indebted to   me would give me a penny   while all that I owed came like a   tumbling house upon me  and so I was cast into this prison  from   whence your bounty has set me free      My poor broken hearted wife would have accompanied me to   jail   but  as I had not wherewithal to give her a morsel of   bread  I sent her to an old aunt  who had the humanity to take   her in      Alas  alas  poor Mr  Vinclex  said I  had I guessed any part   of the mischiefs that our unlucky pranks have brought upon   you  I would have put both my hands into the furnace of Nebu    chadnezzar rather than have had art or part in such a wickedness     for herein we acted the fable of the frogs and the boys that   wliich was play to us was death to you  Mr  Vindex      In conscience  now we are indebted to you for every misfortune   we caused you   and  as you are not yet paid for the half of your   sufferings  I
