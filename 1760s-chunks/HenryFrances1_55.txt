the Spectators were in my Course of Reading  when you was here  and  t other Day  I met a Paper of Addison s  the 2d Paper of the 4th Volume  which supports my Justification of Pope  against your Censure    That there were but few Lines  in his Works  his own   Part of his Preface to his own Works too may be taken in   Every one  who reads  expects their Authors should be Scholars  and yet are angry  when they find them so   Is not your Action your own  because it is as just and graceful as Lady — s     I have sometimes observed to you  the great Inconvenience of a good Memory  which Persons of the best Understandings  or greatest Reading  are seldom incumbered with  by which Means  whatever they read becomes their own  by improving their Minds  without burthening their Memories  and like Persons  who have studied Mathematics  being once convinced of a Demonstration  ever after retain the Truth  tho  the A s and B s  which explained it to them  are forgot  There is something analogous to Digestion in Learning  — One Person shall turn all he eats  and drinks  to sound Flesh  and florid Complexion  while another Person  of a   190 disordered or weakly Constitution  shall quote you a Piece of Partridge  or Pheasant  after every Meal   I beg to hear from you as soon as possible  for I am afraid  the Delay is owing to the Pain in your Arm  you mentioned in one of your Letters   Your constant and affectionate Henry   LETTER CVI   I Think myself vastly obliged to dear Harry  for his obliging Voluntier  I wish it was in my Power to make him a better Return  than meer Thanks  but indeed that is all I have to offer  for I am absolutely grown so intolerably stupid  and have such a confirmed Aversion to Writing  that I hate the Thoughts of touching a Pen  conscious  that it must be as tiresome to you to read  as it is to me to write  Let my Want of Power plead my Excuse  and kindly accept of the Will for the Deed   I have not had Leisure enough  since I received your s  to look for the Paper you mention  You mistake my Opinion with Regard to Pope  I did not say  his Verse was not his own  but that he was only a Versifier  and  as his Thoughts and Expressions are  I think  more elegant  than any of our English Poets  I cannot help being sorry  that he did not strike out   191 something of his own  and not intirely confine his Genius to Translating  or Versifying the Plans  marked out by other Men  for this Reason  I think he had less Merit  tho  more Charms  than many of our English Writers  as the Masons  who built Belvidere  had  in my Mind  no more Pretence to Taste  or Elegance  than if they had built a Barn   For  when some lofty Pile is rais d   We never hear the Workmen prais d  Who bring the Lime  or place the Stones   But all admire Inigo Jones   Had I ever seen Lady —  it is certain I should have endeavoured to copy her  I am glad I did not  for I don t know that I ever yet saw a good Imitation  for what may be elegantly graceful in one Person  may appear ridiculously aukward in another   Your Remark with Regard to Memory is verified in me  for I know no one that has a better than myself  and it is indeed very often a great Incumbrance to me  in more Cases than one   Mrs  — has been very well received by her Father in Law  in Wales  and is all so happy  I sincerely rejoice at it  tho  indeed she does not deserve I should give myself a Moment s Thought about her  She had wrote several Letters to Kitty  and others  not a Line to me  I am sorry to say  she has descended to   192 little Meannesses  I thought her incapable of  particularly  that of divulging every Passage relative to you  herself  and me  with Notes Variorum—on the Folly of my being again reconciled to you  and many dreadful Prophecies on the Consequence —I hope  she will not prove a Cassandra   I told you  in my last Letter  how my Time was employed  I have not been any where from Home  but at the Park  this Fortnight  The Pain in my Arm  which you are so kind as to think of  turned out to be the Rheumatism  I was much worse after I wrote to you  but  by the Help of Patience and Warmth  without Flannel  which I hate  I am now pretty well   I am surprized at your mentioning any Delay on my Side  I have answered every one of your Letters  by the next Post  if you have not got them  there must be some Blunder at your Post Office
