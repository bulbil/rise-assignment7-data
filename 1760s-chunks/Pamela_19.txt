  I will go ten on the way  or till I meet you  as far as one holiday will   go  for that I can get leave to make on such an occasion       And we shall receive you with more pleasure than we had at your birth    when all the worst was over  or than we ever had in our lives       And so God bless you till the happy time comes  say both your mother and   I  which is all at present  from                                     Your truly loving PARENTS                LETTER XVIII         DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER       I thank you a thousand tines for your goodness to me  expressed in your   last letter  I now long to get my business done  and come to my new old   lot again  as I may call it  I have been quite another thing since my   master has turned me off  and as I shall come to you an honest daughter    what pleasure it is to what I should have had  if I could not have seen   you but as a guilty one  Well  my writing time will soon be over  and so   I will make use of it now  and tell you all that has happened since my   last letter       I wondered Mrs  Jervis did not call me to sup with her  and feared she   was angry  and when I had finished my letter  I longed for her coming   to bed  At last she came up  but seemed shy and reserved  and I said    My dear Mrs  Jervis  I am glad to see you  you are not angry with me  I   hope  She said she was sorry things had gone so far  and that she had   a great deal of talk with my master  after I was gone  that he seemed   moved at what I said  and at my falling on my knees to him  and my   prayer for him  at my going away  He said I was a strange girl  he knew   not what to make of me  And is she gone  said he  I intended to say   something else to her  but she behaved so oddly  that I had not power   to stop her  She asked  if she should call me again  He said  Yes  and   then  No  let her go  it is best for her and me too  and she shall go    now I have given her warning  Where she had it  I can t tell  but I   never met with the fellow of her in any life  at any age  She said    he had ordered her not to tell me all  but she believed he would never   offer any thing to me again  and I might stay  she fancied  if I would   beg it as a favour  though she was not sure neither       I stay  dear Mrs  Jervis  said I  why it is the best news that could   have come to me  that he will let me go  I do nothing but long to go   back again to my poverty and distress  as he threatened I should  for   though I am sure of the poverty  I shall not have half the distress I   have had for some months past  I ll assure you       Mrs  Jervis  dear good soul  wept over me  and said  Well  well  Pamela    I did not think I had shewn so little love to you  as that you should   express so much joy upon leaving me  I am sure I never had a child half   so dear to me as you are       I went to hear her so good to me  as indeed she has always been  and   said  What would you have me to do  dear Mrs  Jervis  I love you next to   my own father and mother  and to leave you is the chief concern I have   at quitting this place  but I am sure it is certain ruin if I stay    After such offers  and such threatenings  and his comparing himself to a   wicked ravisher in the very time of his last offer  and turning it into   a jest  that we should make a pretty story in a romance  can I stay and   be safe  Has he not demeaned himself twice  And it behoves me to beware   of the third time  for fear he should lay his snares surer
