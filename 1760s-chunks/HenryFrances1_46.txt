ago  was with me  I recollect  at each different Scene  every Thing  you said to me then and there    155 In the Midst of these Reflections  I often repeat these Lines  in my favourite Ode of Boileau    Voici les Lieux charmants  oú mon âme ravi  Passoit à contempler Silvié   Ces tranquilles Moments  si doûcement perdues     What I told you  was indeed true  that your Presence here  had restored me to the rational Enjoyment of my rural Retreat  I may now say  that your Correspondence has given me   for I would express it strongly  the rational Enjoyment of your Absence  While you were with me  your sprightly Sense  as it were  awakened me from my supine  lethargick Life  and I felt my Intellects growing strong  like one recovering from a Delirium  and your Absence may be considered but as a certain Distance  at which  all beautiful Objects are placed  that their Proportions may be more distinctly observed  and their Symmetry viewed with less Confusion   My sincere Compliments to Kitty  and thank her for the Postscript  on the Back of your Letter  and  to speak in my Stile  as a Man of Business  if any Thing could be an Addition to the Credit of your Bill  it must be her Indorsement on it   Adieu   Henry     156  LETTER LXXXIX   I HEARTILY thank you  dear Harry  for your kind and obliging Letter  I rejoice at the Conclusion of the tiresome Scene  I left you engaged in  and that you are once more returned to you dear  little Eden  It is but fair that you should make a Kind of local Memory for me  as mine is so much devoted to those Moments we spent together  that they alone are present to me  and these  which I now pass  seem but the faint Recollection of insipid Ideas  My Imagination  lively as your own  accompanies you thro  every Step  we ever trod together  I walk with you  sit with you  talk to you — but  oh  there ends the charming Reverie  I cannot  dare not venture to make Replies for you  accustomed as I have been to that elegant Sense  that flows  for ever  from your Lips  my Understanding will not bear to be  imposed upon  even by myself    My Aunt is still in the Country  I have been in the most uncomfortable Way that ever was  since I came to Town  I have been much out of Order with a constant Pain in my Side  and living  as it were  on the Publick  without a Home  I have  at last  got Lodgings at —  but  for particular Reasons  would have you direct to Bond Street     157It would be impossible to give you an Idea of Mrs  — s Behaviour to me  She has however done me a real Service by it  for  tho  it is not even in her Power to prevent my having the sincerest Regard for her Welfare  she has  in a few Days  weaned me from that painful Tenderness  which was contracted by Years of Intimacy  and by which I must have suffered severely  at our Parting  She set out  this Morning  for Wales  may she there  and every where  meet that Happiness  she so much deserves  however hardly she may deal with me  —Don t reply to this Paragraph  lest I should be tempted to accuse you  as the Cause of having lost this still dear and ever valuable Friend   I was a good deal surprized to find by your Letter to Kitty  that you did not intend Writing to me  Was this well done —But I will not pretend to  set you Tasks   please yourself in that Particular  and you ll please me—for this be assured of  that Writing to me cannot be a more disagreeable Employment to you  than Writing is  at all Times  and to all Persons  to me  I have made a strange Jumble of this Writing between you and me  but I will give you Demonstration  that I don t like it  by concluding  like the Story of the Bear and Fiddle    Adeiu     158  LETTER XC   My dear PET   I AM sorry for what you hint at  about Mrs  —  and can t help giving you a Speculation or two upon this Head  tho  you have forbidden me  just to give you a little better Notion of the World  than you have at present  and in order also to make your Mind somewhat easier  with Regard to her Behaviour to you   Persons  who set up for Advisers  arrogate to themselves Perfection  at least  a high Preference to their Pupils  which  with Regard to her and you  would be Perfection  Now  as most People s Pride is superior to their Friendship  it is a great Humbling of one  to find the fancied Superiority not acknowledged  by the Counsel not being regarded  and we would rather our Friends gained one Advantage by our
