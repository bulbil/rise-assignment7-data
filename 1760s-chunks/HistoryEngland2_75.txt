men of broken fortunes  and had come from their native country to retrieve them by acts of rapacity and oppression   202 here  were so much dreaded  or hated  that they lost all influence in inspiring the colonists with a proper spirit of defence  The ministry  however  at home  began to exert itself for their defence  and their measures were hastened by hostilities already commenced  there having been  for some time  a skirmishing between General Lawrence to the north  and Colonel Washington to the south  with parties of the French  in which the latter were victorious  It would be tedious  as well as uninforming  to relate all the preparations that now began to be made by either party  or to load this account with barbarous names and unimportant marches  or to recount the alternate victories and defeats of either side  be it sufficient to observe  that they seemed  in some measure  to have imbibed the ferocity of manners of the savage people  with whom they fought  and exercised various cruelties  either from a spirit of reprisal or revenge   Four operations were undertaken by the English at the same time  one commanded by Colonel Monckton  to drive the French from the incroachments they had made upon the province of Nova Scotia  another to the south  against Crown Point  under the command of General Johnson  a third commanded by General Shirley  against Niagara  and a fourth  still farther to the south  against Du Quesne  under the conduct of General Braddock  In these respective expeditions Monckton was successful  Johnson victorious  though without effect  Shirley was thought dilatory  and his expedition deferred to another season  but the fortunes of Braddock are so extraordinary as to require a more ample detail  This General was recommended to this service by the Duke of Cumberland  who was justly sensible of his courage  and knowledge in the art of war  These two advantages  however  which  upon other occasions  are thought the highest requisites of a General   203 were  in some measure  conducive to this commander s overthrow  His courage made him obstinate  and his skill in war was improper to be exerted in a country where there were no regular advances to be made  nor a marshalled enemy to encounter  This brave but unfortunate man set forward upon the expedition in June  and left Fort Cumberland on the tenth  at the head of two thousand two hundred men  directing his march to that part of the country where General Washington had been defeated the year before  Upon his arrival there he was informed  that the French at fort Du Quesne expected a reinforcement of five hundred men  he therefore resolved  with all haste  to advance  and attack them  before they became too powerful by this assistance  Leaving  therefore  Colonel Dunbar  with eight hundred men  to bring up the provisions  stores  and heavy baggage  as fast as the nature of the service would permit  he marched forward with the rest of his army through a country equally dangerous from its forests and savage inhabitants  a country where Europeans had never before attempted to penetrate  wild  solitary  and hideous  Still  however  he went forward with intrepidity  through the desarts of Oswego  regardless of the enemy s attempts  taking no care previously to explore the woods or thickets  as if the nearer he approached the enemy  the less regardless he was of danger  At length  on the eighth of July  he encamped within ten miles of the fort Du Quesne  which he intended to attack  and the next day resumed his march  without so much as endeavouring to get intelligence of an enemy he despised  With this confidence he was marching forward  his soldiers promised themselves a speedy cessation from their harrassing march  and all things seemed to promise success  when the whole army was at once astonished by a general discharge of arms  from an unseen enemy    204 along the front and left flank  It was now too late to think of retreating  his whole body had passed into the defile  which the enemy had artfully permitted before they attempted to fire  His van guard therefore fell back  in consternation  upon the main body  and the pannic soon became general  The officers alone disdained to fly  while Braddock himself  at their head  discovered the greatest intrepidity  and the highest imprudence  he never thought of retreating  but obstinately continued on the spot where he was  and gave orders to the few brave men who surrounded him  to form according to the rules of war  and regularly advance against the enemy  An enthusiast to the discipline of the field  he desired to bring the spirit of a German campaign into the wilds of Niagara  In the mean time  his officers fell thick about him  while he still continued to issue out orders with composure  though he had five horses shot under him  and though the whole body of his troops was fled  At length he received a musket shot through the lungs  he dropped  and a total confusion ensued  All the artillery  ammunition  and baggage  of the army  were left to the enemy  the General s cabinet of letters also shared the same fate
