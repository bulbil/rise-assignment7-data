much wit  or spirit  or politesse  as Lady Anne Wilmot  Something like a glimmering          1 63       of taste this  I protest I begin to think the girl not quite so tolerable   Je suis votre    A  Wilmot      To the Earl of Belmont      My Lord        AN unforeseen inevitable misfortune having happened to me  for which a too careless oeconomy had left me totally unprovided  I find it necessary to sell my estate and quite the country        I could find a ready purchaser in Mr  Westbrook  who  with the merciless rapacity of an exchange broker  watches like a harpy the decline of every gentleman s fortune in his neighbourhood  in order to seize on his possessions  but the tender affection I bear my tenants makes me solicitous to consult their good as much as possible in the sale  since my hard fate          1 64       will not allow me longer to contribute to it myself  I will not here say more  than that I cannot provide more effectually for their happiness than by selling to your Lordship   I am  my Lord    Your Lordship s most   Obedient and devoted Servant   James Barker      To James Barker  Esq      S I R        I AM extremely concerned any accident should have happened  which makes it possible I should lose from my neighbourhood a gentleman of family  of so very worthy a character  land one I so greatly esteem  but I hope means may be found to prevent what would be so extremely          1 65       regretted by all who have the pleasure of knowing you      As I have always regarded the independent country gentlemen as the strength and glory of this kingdom  and the best supports of our excellent constitution  no increase of power or property to myself shall ever tempt me to lessen the number of them  where it can possibly be avoided  If you have resolution to enter on so exact a system of oeconomy as will enable you to repay any sum you may want in seven years  whatever that sum is  I shall be most happy in advancing it  and will take it back in the manner most easy to you  I think I could trace out a plan by which you might retrench considerably in a manner scarce perceptible  I will to morrow morning call upon you when I am riding out  when we will talk further on this subject  be assured  none of the greedy Leviathans of our days can feel half the pleasure in compleating a          1 66       purchase that I shall do in declining this  if I can be so happy as to keep you amongst us  Your accepting this without hesitation  will be a proof of your esteem which I can never forget  as it will shew you think too highly of me to fear my making an ill use hereafter of having had the happiness of doing for you what  if we were to change present situations  I know you would rejoice in doing for me  I have a fund  which I call the bank of friendship  on which it is my rule to take no interest  and you may command to its utmost extent   I am  dear Sir    Your affectionate friend    and obedient servant    Belmont           1 67         To Colonel Bellville   Thursday      WE have been dining Al fresco in a rustic temple in a wood near the house  romanesque  simple  the pillars trunks of ancient oaks  the roof the bark of trees  the pavement pebbles  the seats moss  the wild melody of nature our music  the distant sound of the cascade just breaks on the ear  which  joined by the chaunt of the birds  the cooing of the doves  the lowing of the herds  and the gently  breathing Western breeze  forms a concert most divinely harmonious        Really this place would be charming  if it was a little more replete with human beings  but to me the finest landscape is a dreary wild  unless adorned by a few groupes of figures     There are  squires indeed             1 68       well  absolutely  your  squires are an agreeable race of people  refined  sentimental  formed for the Belle passion  though it must be owned the  squires about Belmont are rational animals compared to those my Caro Sposo used to associate with  my Lord has exceedingly humanized them  and their wives and daughters are decent creatures  which really amazed me at first  for you know  Bellville  there is in general no standing the
