 in the bosom of a woman  than in that of a man  There is  there must be  I should fancy  more generosity  more tenderness  in the pity of the one  than in that of the other  In a man s pity  I write in the first case from my own sensibilities  in the other from my apprehensions  there is  too probably  a mixture of insult or contempt  Unhappy  indeed  must the woman be  who has drawn upon her the helpless pity of the man she loves   The Ladies and Lord L  will have it  that Sir Charles s Love  however  is not so much engaged for Clementina as his Compassion  They are my sincere friends  They see that I am pretty delicate in my notions of a first Love  and they generously endeavour to inculcate this distinction upon me  But to what purpose  when we evidently see  from what we already know of this story  that his engagements  be the motive what it will  are of such a nature  that they cannot be dispensed with while this Lady s destiny is undetermined   Poor Lady Clementina  From my heart I pity her  And tenderness  I am sure  is the sole motive of my compassion for this fair Unfortunate   Sir Charles set out  immediately after breakfast  for Sir Hargrave s  He will dine with him  and intends to pass the evening with Lord W  We shall all go to town to morrow   WITH this I send the doctor s second pacquet  O my dear  What a noble young Lady is Clementina  What a purity is there in her passion  A Letter of   238 Mrs  Beaumout  Mrs  Beaumont herself an excellent woman  will shew you  that Clementina deserves every good wish  Such a noble struggle did I never hear of  between Religion and Love  O Lucy  you will be delighted with Clementina  You will even  for a while  forget your Harriet  or  if you are just  will think of her but next after Clementina  Never did a young Lady do more honour to her sex  than is done it by Clementina  A flame  the most vehement  suppressed from motives of piety  till  poor Lady  it has devoured her intellects   Read the Letter  and be lost  as I was  for half an hour after I had read it  in silent admiration of her fortitude  O my dear  she must be rewarded with a Sir Charles Grandison  My reason  my justice  compels from me my vote in her favour   My Lord L  and the two Ladies admire her as much as I do  They look at me with eyes of tender concern  They say little  What can they say —But they kindly applaud me for unfeigned admiration of this extraordinary young Lady  But where is my merit  Who can forbear admiring her   Dr  Bartlett s second Letter   YOUR forth enquiry  madam  is   Whether the particularly chearful behaviour of the young Lady  on the departure of Mr  Grandison from Bologna  after a course of melancholy  is anywhere accounted for   And your fifth is  What were the particulars of Mrs  Beaumont s management of the Lady  at Florence  by which she brought her to own her Love  after she had so long kept it a secret from her mother  and all her family   What I shall transcribe  in order to satisfy you  madam  with regard to the fifth article  will include all that you can wish to be informed of  respecting the fourth     239 But let me premise  That Mrs  Beaumont  at the request of the Marchioness  undertook to give an account of the health of the young Lady  and what effect the change of air  of place  and her advice  had upon her mind  after she had been at Florence for two or three days  She  on the fourth day of their being together  wrote to that Lady the desired particulars  The following is a translation of her Letter   YOUR Ladyship will excuse me for not writing till now  when you are acquainted that it was not before last night that I could give you any tolerable satisfaction on the subject upon which I had engaged to do myself that honour   I have made myself mistress of the dear young Lady s Secret  Your Ladyship guessed it  perhaps  too well  Love  but a pure and laudable Love  is the malady that has robbed her of her tranquillity for so long a space  and your splendid family of all comfort  But such a magnanimity  shewn or endeavoured at  that she deserves to be equally pitied and admired  What is it that the dear young Lady has not suffered in a conflict between her duty  her Religion  and her Love   The discovery  I am afraid  will not give pleasure to your family  yet certainty  in what must be  is better than suspense  You will think me a managing person  perhaps  from the relation I have to give you  But it was the task prescribed me  and you
