known my best wishes for the restoration of his health  How good is his sister to accompany him —I always loved her   I received yesterday yours  madam  acquainting me with Mr  Greville s visit and proposal  and asking my opinion of the latter  and whether I would choose to mention it to Lucy and my aunt  What can I say  You once told me  madam  that you believed Lucy would not have refused Mr  Greville  had he first applied to her  Lucy s grandmother  you say  is not averse to the match  and you think my uncle would not refuse his consent  because of the contiguity of their respective estates  and in hopes  that he might resume with success  on such an event  his favourite project of exchange of lands  Yet I am sure this consideration would have no weight with him  if he thought Lucy could not be happy with Mr  Greville   I have mentioned it to my aunt  She says  Mr  Greville is not a bashful man  He knows how to apply to Lucy himself  And she has no notion  in such a case  of that pride which with holds him till he thinks himself sure of the family interest   He will  if possible  he says  be related to me  Let that be mentioned to Lucy  as one of his principal motives  and his business with her is done for ever   Lady G  would laugh at the notion of a difficulty from a first Love  First Love she calls first nonsense  Too frequently it is so  Lucy is a noble girl  She has overcome a first attachment  the more laudably  as it cost her some struggles to do it  Mr  Greville  I doubt  has had several first Loves  This transition  therefore  is nothing to him  So neither of them   71 will be first Love to the other  It may therefore be a match of discretion  Yet his character  The reformation he boasts of —I hope he is reformed  But I have no notion of a good young woman  as Lucy is  trusting her person  I may say her principles  to the arbitrary will of an impetuous man  who has been an a vowed Libertine  and pretend not to have reformed from proper convictions  A scoffer too  How came he by his new Lights —You  madam  have told us young folks the difficulty of overcoming evil habits  I own that Lucy alway spoke of him with more faviour than any body else  She was inclined to think him a good natured man  and was pleased with what she called humour in him  Humour  I never could call it so  Humour  I used to tell her  is a gentle  a decent  tho  a lively thing  Mr  Greville is boisterous  impetuous  rude  I had almost said  His courtship to me was either rant  or affront  the one to shew his Plain dealing  the other his Love  He knows not what respectful Love is  In short  his mirth  his good nature  as it is called  has fierceness in it  it always gave me apprehension   As to worldly matters  there can be no exception to him  But I cannot be of the opinion of Lucy s grandmother  that he is a generous man  He has only qualities that look like generosity  His start to me  when he resigned his pretensions to me  as they have been called  for I know not any he had  was only a start  He could not hold it  But be all these things as they may  how can I  who love Lucy as myself  propose to the dear girl a man  whom I could not think of for myself  Lucy has a fine fortune  and surely there are men enow in the world  who have never made pretensions to Lucy s cousin  who would think themselves honoured by her acceptance  otherwise  I should  after Sir Rowland s hint  and earnest wishes in his nephew s favour  much sooner recommend Mr  Fowler to her than Mr  Greville     72 MY aunt had said  that  for her part  she should choose to leave the above affair to its own workings  Yet could not forbear to acquaint Lucy with it  The dear girl came to me  to demand a sight of your Letter  and of what I had written upon it  I could not  tho  I had some little reluctance to shew her the latter  deny her  I will give you  madam  the substance of a short dialogue that passed between us on the occasion  and leave it to you to draw such conclusions from it  as you shall judge proper  with regard to my Lucy s inclinations   She did not know what I meant  she said  by writeing to you  that she had always spoken of Mr  Greville with more favour than any body else   It is ungenerous  Lucy  if you are angry at what you would oblige me to shew you against my will   I am not angry  But—She stopt  and would not explain her half
