He got   up in haste and went in person to inspect the party  When he   entered  he saw a young woman who looked very pale and sickly    but of a genteel appearance  and neatly though plainly dressed    She cast upon him a sensible and penetrating look  and curtsying to   him  with downcast eyes Sir  said she  your presence tells me that   you are master here  I know not for what offence your people have   confined me   but if it is on any suspicion of misbehaviour  I have   here the certificate of a worthy man and a great saint  who vouches   at least for the innocence of my conduct  Here she presented   him with a paper that contained the following words         I certify that the bearer hath served me upwards of five years    in quality of housekeeper and intendant of my family   and that she   is a young woman of distinguished piety and merit  and departs  at   her own desire  on some business to London  Given under my   hand   c       MAEMADUKE CATHAEINES  01       On reading this Mr  Fenton bowed  and made a motion with his   hand for her to sit down  He then took a pen and paper that lay   beside him  and wrote to the purpose  that he requested her to   allow him to detain her certificate for about an hour   after which   he would return it  and endeavour to make her amends for the   unbecoming treatment which his people had given her      On casting her eye over the paper  she made a low curtsy  and   said I shall willingly attend  sir  during your pleasure   but hope    in the mean time  that your charity will afford me a morsel or two   of the fragments of your last meal      Mr  Fenton then pulled a bell  and having ordered some cold   meats and wine to be served  he bowed  and withdrew to his   company      Ned  said he  as he entered  this woman is just as much the   empress of Russia as she is your mammy  Here  Mr  Clement    look at this certificate   I have no reason to doubt the truth of the         246 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      character given in it  for her person and manners are every way   conformable  I am sorry at heart that I sent in such a hurry for   Mr  and Mrs  Fielding   I have thereby raised a sort of expectation   in them  and it may be very mortifying to have that expectation so   suddenly and so wholly defeated      Some time after a coach and six frothing horses drove up to the   door  and Mr  and Mrs  Fielding alighted  with a kind of impatience   and trepidation apparent in their countenance  As soon as Mr    Fenton had duly received and seated them My dear madam  says   he to Mrs  Fielding  I think myself very unhappy in having given   you a deal of unnecessary trouble  My poor Ned here  has been   utterly mistaken in the person of the woman whom he took to be   his mammy  The certificate of her certain residence bears a date   even previous to that in which we found him   and her deportment   is more than a thousand testimonies against her being of the   wandering or dissolute class of people  Be pleased  Mr  Fielding    to look over this certificate   I think it has all the marks of its   being genuine      The moment that Mr  Fielding cast his eye on the paper A well    known character  indeed  he exclaimed  It is the hand of Mr    Catharines  my tutor  my friend   the man of the world  excepting   yourself  Mr  Fenton  for whom I have the dearest respect and affec    tion  No question can be made of any thing to which he sets his   affirmative      Alas   cried Mrs  Fielding  then all the hopes we had conceived   must again be cast aside  Here comes our nurse  too  poor woman    in great haste  I sent her word that we had found the person   whom we suspected to have stolen our child  and desired that she   would meet me here directly      While Mrs  Fielding spoke  nurse entered panting  and almost   breathless   and  without saluting or taking any notice of the   company Where  she hastily cried  where is the boy  madam  whom   you suppose to be your child
