 and unwilling to provoke him by any appearance of constraint  gave no caution to the gentleman with whom he was lodged to observe his motions  he is ready to kill himself for this neglect  but relying on Mr Faulkland’s promise not to make any attempt on his life  he suspected not that he would endeavour to escape  Escape do I call it  rather let me say  to throw himself into certain destruction —He is set out on his way for Ireland  Heaven knows what will be the consequence of this  if my brother does not overtake and persuade him back  He is gone after him  my cousin Warner with him  both rode post   My thoughts are so confused  I can put nothing in order  It seems we had not long quitted him  when he called up his servant  that groom who  as I informed you  had come over with him  and telling him he was going out of town ordered him to go directly to an inn somewhere in the city  and hire two post horses  and that he would follow him presently   The man obeyed  and in about half an hour  his master came in a hackney coach to the place where he had directed him to wait for him   Upon the inn keeper’s enquiring whither the horses were to go  Mr Faulkland replied  to St Alban’s  The man objected to the length of the stage  and named Barnet  Mr Faulkland seemed impatient and angry  his unusual earnestness  his wild looks  and the road he    purposed taking  alarmed his servant  a discreet elderly man  and he had the prudence immediately to dispatch the master of the house  whom he prevailed on by a piece of money  to go directly to my brother with this intelligence   He had the precaution not to mention his master’s name  only bade him find out Sir George Bidulph  and tell him that his friend was set out for St Alban’s  and that his man had dispatched him with the news  and would  if possible  endeavour to detain him on the road  that Sir George might overtake him   The man was punctual in delivering his message  My brother  wild with amazement and horror  just called as he past my door  to tell me this new and unexpected misfortune  Mr Warner had that instant come to enquire what had past between Mr Faulkland and me in our interview this morning  I had no time to tell him any thing  He looked very much displeased at my brother and me  upon hearing Mr Faulkland was gone  but said he would accompany Sir George  and they both hurried away together   The man said  Mr Faulkland had set off before he could leave his house  the servant having scarce time to give him the message   I fear it will be impossible for my brother to overtake him—He will be lost forever—what then will be my portion  Happy had it been for me indeed  as my dear mother once said in the bitterness of her heart  that I had died in my cradle  Tuesday night twelve o’clock Heaven be praised  they are returned  All returned  Mr Faulkland has been prevailed on to come back  Mr Warner has prevailed on him  He has saved his life  but  my Cecilia  thy friend’s temporal happiness  and peace of mind  is the only price that could ransom this desperate self devoted victim   Mr Warner has bound himself by a solemn oath that I should become his wife  or Mr Faulkland  determined on his own destruction  would  spite of all they could do  have pursued his fatal journey to Ireland  in order to deliver himself up to justice   It was near ten o’clock before they returned to town  My brother carried Mr Faulkland back to the gentleman’s house  where he was before lodged  and my kinsman left them together  in order to come and give me an account of what passed   He said the gentleman  at whose house he was lodged by my brother was extreamly surprized at seeing him again  Mr Faulkland    having with great composure taken his leave of him in the morning  and after thanking him for the shelter he had afforded him  told him he was going out of town   My brother and my kinsman overtook him above a mile on this side St Alban’s  for which success they were intirely indebted to the prudence of the servant who attended him  For the poor man  finding himself pushing on with the utmost eagerness  and Mr Faulkland no longer making a secret of this intention of returning to Ireland  resolved at all events to prevent his ruin  and hoping that by a little delay  Sir George might overtake them  contrived at their first stage so dexterously to slip a nail in between the horse’s shoe and his hoof  that he knew he could not go far without being lame   This succeeded so well  that the poor animal was soon disabled  and Mr Faulkland not having it in his power to mount himself better  was obliged to go on at a very easy rate ’till they arrived at the next stage   Mr Warner and my brother overtook him in this situation  Sir George knew
