of long continuance  The king is naturally good  When his anger shall have passed away  and your deplorable estate shall occur to his milder thoughts  your punishment will appear sufficient in his eyes  With these words  my kind hearted gaoler went down stairs  and sent the servants to take away  Not even the brass candlesticks were left behind  and I went to bed by the palpable darkness of a glimmering lamp suspended against the wall       CH  V     His reflections before he went to sleep that night  and the noise that waked him   Two hours at least were my thoughts employed on what Tordesillas had told me  Here  then  am I  for having lent myself to the pleasures of the heir apparent  It was certainly not having my wits about me  to pander for so young a prince  Therein consists my crime  had he been arrived at a more knowing age  the king perhaps might only have laughed at what has now made him so angry  But who can have given such counsel to the monarch  without dreading the prince s resentment or the Duke of Lerma s  That minister will doubtless take ample vengeance for his nephew the Count de Lemos  How can the king have made the discovery  That is above my comprehension   This last was the eternal burden of my song  But the idea most afflictive to my mind  what drove me to despair  and laid fiend  like hold upon my fancy  was the unquestioned plunder of my effects  My strong box  exclaimed I  my dear wealth  what is become of you  Into what hands have you fallen  Alas  you are lost in less time than you were gained  The ruinous confusion of my household was the perpetual death s head of my imagination  Yet this wilderness of melancholy ideas sheltered me from absolute distraction  sleep  which had shunned my wretched straw  now paid his readier visit to my soft and gentle manly couch  Watching and wine  too  imparted a strong narcotic to his poppies  My slumbers were profound  and to all appearance  the day might have peeped in upon my repose  if I had not been awakened all at once by such sounds as rarely perforate a prison wall  I heard the thrum of a guitar  accompanying a man s voice  My whole attention was absorbed  but the invisible musician paused  and left the fleeting impression of a dream  An instant after wards  my ear was soothed with the sound of the same instrument  and the same voice   Wisely the ant against poor winter hoards The stock which summer s wealth affords  In grasshoppers  that must at autumn die  How vain were such an industry   Of love or fortune the deceitful light Might half excuse our cheated sight  If it of life the whole small time would stay  And be our sunshine all the day    To have substituted  with a slight variation  these two stanzas from Cowley for a translation of the common place couplet in the original  will probably not be thought to require any apology  They necessarily involve a change in the consequent reflections of our hero  TRANSLATOR   These verses  which sounded as if they had been sung expressly for the dirge of my departed happiness  were only an aggravation of my feelings  The truth of the sentiment  said I  is but too well exemplified in me  The meteor of court favour has but plunged me in substantial darkness  the summer sunshine of ambition is quenched in these autumnal glooms  Now did I sink again into cold and comfortless meditation  my miseries began to flow afresh  as if they fed and grew upon their own vital stream  Yet my wailings ended with the night  and the first rays which played upon my chamber wall amused my mind into composure  I got up to open my window  and let the vivid air of morning into my room  Then I glanced over the country  so attractively depicted in the description of my keeper  It did not seem to justify his panegyric  The ErÃªma  a second Tagus in my magnifying fancy  was little better than a brook  Its flowery banks were fringed with nettles  and arrayed in all the majesty of thistles  the delicious vale in this fairy prospect was a barren wilderness  untamed by human labour  It therefore was very evident that my keener sensations were not yet softened into such a composed melancholy  as could give any but a jaundiced colouring to the landscape   I began dressing  and had already half finished my toilet  when Tordesillas ushered in an old chambermaid  laden with shirts and towels  Signor Gil Blas  said he  here is your linen  Do not be saving of it  there shall always be as many changes as you can possibly want  Well now  and how have you passed the night  Has the drowsy god administered his anodyne  I could have slept till this time  answered I  if I had not been awakened by a voice singing to a guitar  The cavalier who has disturbed your repose  resumed he  is a state prisoner  and his chamber is contiguous to yours  He is a knight of the military order
