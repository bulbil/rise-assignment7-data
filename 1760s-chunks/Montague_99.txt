a man of an excellent sense  and of honor  and has a very lively tenderness for my daughter       It will  I am afraid  be some time before I can leave this country  as I chuse to take my daughter and Mr  Fitzgerald with me  in order to the latter s soliciting a majority  in which pursuit I shall without scruple tax your Lordship s friendship to the utmost       I am extremely happy at this event  as Bell s volatile temper made me sometimes afraid of her chusing inconsiderately  their marriage is not yet declared  for some family reasons  not worth particularizing to your Lordship       As soon as leave of absence comes from New York  for me and Mr  Fitzgerald  we shall settle things for taking leave of Canada  which I however assure your Lordship I shall do with some reluctance       The climate is all the year agreable and healthy  in summer divine  a man at my time of life cannot leave this chearing  enlivening sun without reluctance  the heat is very like that of Italy or the South of France  without that oppressive closeness which generally attends our hot weather in England       The manner of life here is chearful  we make the most of our fine summers  by the pleasantest country parties you can imagine  Here are some very estimable persons  and the spirit of urbanity begins to diffuse itself from the centre  in short  I shall leave Canada at the very time when one would wish to come to it        It is astonishing  in a small community like this  how much depends on the personal character of him who governs       I am obliged to break off abruptly  the person who takes this to England being going immediately on board       I have the honor to be       My Lord   Your Lordship s   c   WM  FERMOR     LETTER CLX   160   To JOHN TEMPLE  Esq  Pall Mall   Silleri  July 13   I AGREE with you  my dear Temple  that nothing can be more pleasing than an awakened English woman  of which you and my caro sposo have  I flatter myself  the happy experience  and wish with you that the character was more common  but I must own  and I am sorry to own it  that my fair countrywomen and fellow citizens  I speak of the nation in general  and not of the capital  have an unbecoming kind of reserve  which prevents their being the agreable companions  and amiable wives  which nature meant them       From a fear  and I think a prudish one  of being thought too attentive to please your sex  they have acquired a certain distant manner to men  which borders on ill breeding  they take great pains to veil  under an affected appearance of disdain  that winning sensibility of heart  that delicate tenderness  which renders them doubly lovely       They are even afraid to own their friendships  if not according to the square and rule  are doubtful whether a modest woman may own she loves even her husband  and seem to think affections were given them for no purpose but to hide       Upon the whole  with at least as good a native right to charm as any women on the face of the globe  the English have found the happy secret of pleasing less       Is my Emily arrived  I can say nothing else   Twelve o clock       I am the happiest woman in the creation  papa has just told me  we are to go home in six or seven weeks       Not but this is a divine country  and our farm a terrestrial paradise  but we have lived in it almost a year  and one grows tired of every thing in time  you know  Temple       I shall see my Emily  and flirt with Rivers  to say nothing of you and my little Lucy       Adieu  I am grown very lazy since I married  for the future  I shall make Fitzgerald write all my letters  except billet doux  in which I think I excel him   Yours         A  FITZGERALD     LETTER CLXI   161   To Miss FERMOR  at Silleri   Dover  July 8   I AM this moment arrived  my dear Bell  after a very agreable passage  and am setting out immediately for London  from whence I shall write to you the moment I have seen Mrs  Rivers  I will own to you I tremble at the idea of this interview  yet am resolved to see her  and open all my soul to her in regard to her son  after which  I shall leave her the mistress of my destiny  for  ardently as I love him  I will never marry him but with her approbation       I have a thousand anxious fears for my Rivers s safety  may heaven protect him from the dangers his Emily has escaped       I have but a moment to write  a ship being under way which is bound to Quebec  a gentleman  who is
