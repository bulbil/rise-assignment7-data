from the disease  than I bethought myself of my honest friend Strap  and resolving to make him happy forthwith  in the knowledge of my good fortune  told my father  in general  that I had been infinitely obliged to this faithful adherent  and begged he would indulge me so far as to send for him  without letting him know my happiness  until he could receive an account of it from my own mouth   My request was instantly complied with  and a messenger with a spare mule detached to the ship  carrying orders from the captain to the mate to send the steward by the bearer —My health being  in the mean time  re established  and my mind composed  I began to relish this important turn of my fortune  in reflecting upon the advantages with which it must be attended  and as the idea of my lovely Narcissa always joined itself to every scene of happiness I could imagine  I entertained myself now  with the prospect of possessing her in that distinguished sphere  to which she was intitled by her birth and qualifications —Having often mentioned her name while I was   332 deprived of my senses  my father guessed that there was an intimate connexion between us  and discovering the picture which hung in my bosom by a ribbon  did not doubt that it was the resemblance of my amiable mistress  In this belief he was confirmed by my uncle  who told him that it was the picture of a young woman  to whom I was under promise of marriage —Alarmed at this piece of information  Don Rodriguez took the first opportunity of questioning me about the circumstances of this affair  which when I had candidly recounted  he approved of my passion  and promised to contribute all in his power towards its success  though I never doubted his generosity  I was transported on this occasion  and throwing myself at his feet  told him  he had now compleated my happiness  for without the possession of Narcissa  I should be miserable among all the pleasures of life —He raised me with a smile of paternal fondness  said  he knew what it was to be in love  and observed  that if he had been as tenderly beloved by his father  as I was by mine  he would not now  perhaps  have cause—Here he was interrupted by a sigh  the tear stood collected in his eye  he suppressed the dictates of his grief  and the time being opportune  desired me to relate the passages of my life  which my uncle had told him were manifold and surprizing —I recounted the most material circumstances of my fortune  to which he listened with wonder and attention  manifesting from time to time those different emotions  which my different situations may be supposed to have raised in a parent s breast  and when my detail was ended  blessed God for the adversity I had undergone  which    333 he said  enlarged the understanding  improved the heart  steeled the constitution  and qualified a young man for all the duties and enjoyments of life  much better than any education which affluence could bestow   When I had thus satisfied his curiosity  I discovered an inclination to hear the particulars of his story  which he gratified  by beginning with his marriage  and proceeding to the day of his disappearing  as I have related in the first part of my memoirs     Careless of life  continued he  and unable to live in a place where every object recalled the memory of my dear Charlotte  whom I had lost through the barbarity of an unnatural parent  I took my leave of you  my child  then an infant  with an heart full of unutterable woe  but little suspecting that my father s unkindness would have descended to my innocent orphan  and setting out alone  at midnight  for the nearest sea port  early next morning got on board a ship  bound  as I had heard  for France  and bargaining with the master for my passage  bid a long adieu to my native country  and put to sea with the first fair wind  The place of our destination was Granville  but we had the misfortune to run upon a ridge of rocks near the island of Alderney called the Gaskets  where the sea running high  the ship went to pieces  the boat sunk along side  and every soul on board perished  except myself  who by the assistance of a grating  got ashore on the coast of Normandy  I went directly to Caen  where I was so lucky as to meet with a Count  whom I had formerly known in my travels  With this gentleman  I set out for   334 Paris  where I was recommended by him and other friends  as a tutor to a young nobleman  whom I accompanied to the court of Spain —There we remained a whole year  at the end of which my pupil being recalled by his father  I quitted my office and staid behind  by the advice of a certain Spanish grandee who took me into his protection  and introduced me to another nobleman  who was afterwards created Viceroy of Peru —He insisted on my attending him to his government in the Indies  where  however  by reason of my religion  it was not in
