in the presence and on the account of Amelia  I wished   for death  as my only relief  and determined to seek it  But  alas     my resolution failed me  and I feared to die  In this misery I was   dragged before a magistrate  who  enumerating the crimes we had   been guilty of  condemned me to immediate death    f   This sentence  so much milder than my fears  awoke a hope of   further mercy  to obtain which  my evil genius suggested it to me to   apply to Amelia  absurdly flattering myself that some sparks of   her love for me might yet remain alive  or  at least  her goodness   take delight in showing itself superior to my ill treatment  Base   hope  that met its just reward       I therefore waived attempting a defence of other crimes  as I   was conscious that I could not make any  but asserted my innocence   as to the particular charge of a base design upon Amelia at the   time I was taken  adding that   I had the honour of being nearly   related to that lady  and that  if I was indulged with a few words   with her in the presence of all there  I hoped I might be found to   merit a mitigation of my sentence        On my mentioning the name of Amelia  I observed one of the   principal persons in the court  whom I soon understood to be her   husband  kindle into rage  He did not  however  interrupt me    but as soon as I had concluded  he started up and exclaimed with   the most furious indignation     Amelia thy relation   No more   than angels are related to devils  by springing from the same   Creator   Her virtues are dishonoured by the claim   But she   shall appear and disprove the odious calumny        Saying which words  he instantly went for her  while a hollow   murmur of surprise and detestation made the silence of the court   the more dreadful  and heightened the horrors of my suspense          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA IT     But I waited not long  Amelia soon appeared  led in by her   husband  and being seated by the judge     Where    said she    looking round with the serenity of conscious virtue    where is the   person who says he is related to me         The sight of her threw me into such a conflict of passions  that   without reflecting where I was  or how necessary it might be for   me to raise her compassion by some moving address that might    soften the severity of her resentment for my former treatment of   her  as well as assure her of my innocence of any base designs against   her person  in the condition she was in when I was taken  I could   not forbear crying out in English â€” for I had spoken before in Spanish   in which I expressed myself but badly     Oh  Amelia   hast thou   then forgot me         At the sound of my voice she started  and looking earnestly at    me for a momeiit  fell upon her knees  and lifting her hands and   eyes to heaven  she said aloud in Spanish     God  how signal   is this justice   Let me  let all the world acknowledge and adore   it     And then  rising and turning to her husband  who stood in   amazement     This  my lord    said she    this is the man of whom   I have informed you  This is that Traffic whose base dishonesty   obliged me to leave my native country   and so  by that Providence   which is able to turn the greatest misfortune into a blessing  was   made the cause of my present happiness with you  I abjure all    kindred with him  I desire he may be examined as to my story    and if he can vary in the least from what I have told you  let me   be condemned to the severest punishment but that of staying longer   in his sight  or ever seeing his face more        On this she withdrew  without deigning a look at me  But her   words had a proper efiect upon my heart  and I resolved to do her   justice  I therefore prevented her husband s command  and in as   few words as possible related the black affair with the strictest   truth  When I had concluded  her lord declared that I had not   only confirmed everything she had told him
