I shewed them some play  I kept them engaged on either side so fiercely  that they were sorry perhaps not to have taken a safer road to their revenge  The husband was run through the body  His brother in law  seeing him on his travels to the shades below  made the best of his way to the door  which the duenna and Violante had opened  to make their escape while we were fighting  I ran after him into the street  where I met with Lamela once more  who by dint of not being able to get a word out of the women  running as they did for their very lives  did not know exactly what he was to divine from the infernal noise he had just heard  We got back to our inn  After packing up what was best worth taking with us  we mounted our mules  and got out of town  without waiting for daybreak or fear of robbers   It was sufficiently clear that this business was not likely to be without its consequences  and that a hue and cry would be set up in Toledo  which we should act like wise men to anticipate by a retreat  We stayed the night at Vilarubia  At the inn where we put up  some time after our arrival  there alighted a tradesman of Toledo on his way to Segorba  We clubbed our suppers  He related to us the tragical catastrophe of Violante s husband  and so far was he from suspecting us of being parties concerned  that we inquired into particulars with the curious indifference of common newsmongers  Gentlemen  said he  just as I was setting out this morning  the report of this melancholy event was handed about  Every one was on the hunt after Violante  and they say that the corregidor  a relation of Don Balthazar  is determined on sparing no pains to discover the perpetrators of this murder  So much for my knowledge of the business   The corregidor of Toledo and his police gave me very little uneasiness  But for fear of the worst  I determined to precipitate my retreat from New Castile  It occurred to me that Violante  when hunted out of her hiding place  would turn informer  and in that case she might give such a description of my person to the clerks in office as might enable them to put their scouts upon a right scent  For this reason  on the following day we struck out of the high road  as a measure of safety  Fortunately Lamela was acquainted with three fourths of Spain  and knew by what cross paths we could get securely into Arragon  Instead of going straight to Cuen√ßa  we threaded the defiles of the mountains overhanging that town  and arrived  by ways with which my guide was well acquainted  at a grotto looking very much like a hermitage  In fact  it was the very place whither you came yesterday evening to petition me for an asylum   While I was reconnoitring the neighbourhood  which presented a most delicious landscape to my view  my companion said to me  It is six years since I travelled this way  At that time the grotto before us afforded a retreat to an old hermit who entertained me charitably  He made me fare as he did  I remember that he was a holy man  and talked in such a strain as almost to wean me from the vices and follies of this nether world  He may possibly be still living  I will ascertain whether it be so or not  With these words in his mouth  Ambrose  under the influence of natural curiosity  alighted from his mule  and went into the hermitage  He remained there some minutes  and then returned  calling after me  and saying  Come hither  Don Raphael  come and bear witness to a most affecting event  I dismounted immediately  We tied our mules to a tree  and I followed Lamela into the grotto  where I descried an old anchoret stretched at his length upon a couch  pale and at the point of death  A white beard  very thick  hung down to his middle  and he held a large rosary  most piously ornamented  in his clasped hands  At the noise which we made in coming near him  he opened his eyes  upon which death had already begun to lay his leaden hand  and after having looked at us for a moment  said   Whosoever you are  my brethren  profit by the spectacle which presents itself to your observation  I have seen out forty years in the world  and sixty in this solitude  But mark  At this eternal crisis  the time I have devoted to my pleasures seems an age  and that on the contrary which has been sacred to repentance  but a minute  Alas  I fear lest the austerities of brother Juan should be found light in the balance with the sins of the licentiate Don Juan de Solis    No sooner were these words out of his mouth than he breathed his last  We were struck by the solemn scene  Objects of this kind always make some impression even on the greatest libertines  but our serious thoughts were of no long duration  We soon forgot what he had been saying to us  and begun making an inventory of what the
