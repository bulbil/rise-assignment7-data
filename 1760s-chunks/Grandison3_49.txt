 said she  But be the Lady native or foreigner  it is my humble opinion    120 that my brother is in love  He has all the symptoms of it  that I can guess by   I am of Charlotte s opinion  Lucy  Such tender sentiments  such sweetness of manners  such gentleness of voice —Love has certainly done all this for him  And the Lady  to be sure  is a foreigner  It would be strange if such a man should not have engaged his heart in the seven or eight years past  and those from Eighteen to Twenty six or seven  the most susceptible of a man s life   But what means he by saying     His peace has been broken to pieces by a tender fault in his constitution    —Compassion  I suppose  for some unhappy object —I will soon return to town  and there prepare to throw myself into the arms of my dearest relations in Northamptonshire  I shall otherwise  perhaps  add to the number of those who have broken his peace     But it is strange  methinks  that he could not have answered  Whether the Lady is a foreigner  or not   Dr  Bartlett  you are mistaken  Sir Charles Grandison is not so very un  reserved a man as you said he was   But Oh  my dear little flattering Emily  how could you tell me  that you watched his eyes  and saw them always kindly bent on me—Yes  perhaps  when you thought so  he was drawing comparisons to the advantage of his fair foreigner  from my less agreeable features —  But this Olivia  Lucy  I want to know something more of her    Nothing   he says  to wish for from Olivia    Poor Lady  Methinks I am very much inclined to pity her     Well  but I will proceed now to his next subject  I wish I could find some faults in him  It is a cruel thing to be under a kind of necessity to be angry with a man whom we cannot blame  And yet  in the next conversation  you will see him angry  Don t you long Lucy  to see how Sir Charles Grandison will behave when he is angry     121  LETTER XVI  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   NOW  Charlotte  said he  as if he had fully answered the questions put to him—O these men   let me ask you a question or two—I had a visit made me yesterday  by Lord G   What  my dear  do you intend to do  with regard to him —But perhaps  you would choose to withdraw with me  on this question   Miss Gr  I wish I had made to you the same overture of withdrawing  Sir Charles  on the questions I put to you  I should have had more satisfaction given me  I fansy  than I can boast of  if I had   Sir Ch  I will withdraw with you  if you please  and hear any other questions you have to put to me   Miss Gr  You can put no questions to me  Sir  that I shall have any objection to answer before this company   Sir Ch  You know my question  Charlotte   Miss Gr  What would you advise me to do in that affair  brother   Sir Ch  I have only one piece of advice to give you —It is  That you will either encourage or discourage his address  if you know your own mind   Miss Gr  I believe  brother  you want to get rid of me   Sir Ch  Then you intend to encourage Lord G   Miss Gr  Does that follow  Sir   Sir Ch  Or you could not have supp•sed  that I wanted to part with you  But  come  Charlotte  let us retire  It is very difficult to get a direct answer to such questions as these  from Ladies  before company  tho  the company be ever so nearly related to them   Miss Gr  I can answer  before this company  any questions that relate to Lord G     122  Sir Ch  Then you don t intend to encourage him   Miss Gr  I don t see how that follows  neither  from what I said   Sir Ch  It does  very clearly  I am not an absolute stranger to the language of women  Charlotte   Miss Gr  I thought my brother too polite to reflect upon the sex   Sir Ch  Is it to reflect upon the sex  to say  that I am not an absolute stranger to their language   Miss Gr  I protest  I think so  in the way you spoke it   Sir Ch  Well  then  try if you cannot find a language to speak in  that may not be capable of such an interpretation   Miss Gr  I am afraid you are displeased with me  brother  I will answer more directly   Sir Ch  Do  my Charlotte  I have promised Lord G  to procure him an answer—
