 At his return he found her engaged in conversation with several   gentlemen and ladies  he mingled in the company  but could expect no   other satisfaction from it than being near his dear Charlotta  and   hearing her speak  The Chevalier St  George soon after came out  and he   was obliged with the rest of his train to quit the place  which at   present contained the object of his wishes  She went in immediately   after to the princess  so he saw her no more that day at St  Germains       All that now employed his thoughts was a pretence to visit her at her   father s house  for tho  she had told him in her letter that he might   come as an ordinary acquaintance  yet knowing that the continuance of   their conversation depended wholly on the secrecy of it  he was willing   to avoid giving even the most distant occasions of suspicion       Fortune  hitherto favourable to his desires  now presented him with one   more ample than any thing his own invention could have supplied him   with  happening to be at Paris in the company of some friends  with whom   he stayed later than ordinary  he was hurrying thro  the streets in   order to go to the inn where his servant and horses waited for him  when   he heard the clashing of swords at some distance from him  guided by his   generosity  he flew to the place where the noise directed him  and saw   by the lights  which hang out very thick in that city  one person   defending himself against three who pressed very hard upon him  and had   got him down just as Horatio arrived to his relief  he ran among the   assaillants  and either the greatness of his courage  or the belief that   others would come to his assistance  threw them into such a   consternation  that they all sought their safety in their flight  while   the person they had attacked got up again and thanked his deliverer    without whose timely aid  he said  he could have expected nothing but   death  those who set upon him being robbers  and  as he perceived by   their behaviour  desperate wretches  who were for securing themselves by   taking the lives  as well as money  of those who were too weak to resist   them  he pointed to a dead body on the ground  who he told Horatio was   his servant  and had been killed in his defence       But how transported was our young lover when  he found that the person   to whom he had done so signal a piece of service  was the father of his   mistress  As he perceived he had some wounds  tho  they proved but   slight  he compleated the obligation he had began to confer  by   supporting him under the arm till he got home  where the baron made him   enter with him  and would have prevailed with him to stay all night  but   Horatio told him he could not well dispense with being absent from his   post  that it was highly proper he should return to St  Germains that   night late as it was  but would do himself the honour of waiting on him   the next day to enquire after the state of the wounds he had received       Mademoiselle Charlotta was gone to bed  but being rouzed by the   accident  no sooner was informed by the surgeons  who were immediately   sent for  that there was nothing dangerous in the hurts her father had   received  than she blessed heaven for making Horatio the instrument of   his preservation  The sense the baron seemed to have of this obligation    and the praises he bestowed on the gallant manner in which the young   gentleman came to his relief  made her almost ready to flatter herself   that fate interested itself in behalf of their love  and indeed monsieur   the baron  notwithstanding the haughtiness of his nature  had the most   just notions of gratitude  and to testify it to Horatio  would have   refused him scarce any thing except his daughter  But however that   should happen  she still found more and more excuses for indulging the   inclinations she had for him  and tho  she yet had never given him any   such assurances  yet she resolved in her own mind  to live only for him       The baron being obliged to keep his bed for several days  Horatio had a   pretence for repeating his visits to him during this time of his   confinement  and afterwards went often by invitation  the other  besides   the obligation he had to him  finding something extremely pleasing in   his conversation  to which  not to take from Horatio s merits  the   obsequiousness he found no difficulty in himself to behave
