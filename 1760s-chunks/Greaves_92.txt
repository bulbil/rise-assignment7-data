complacency which was natural to his disposition  He kissed all her children  who were remarkably handsome and neatly kept  though in homely apparel  and  giving her his direction  assured her she might always apply to him in her distress   After her departure  he produced a bank note of twenty pounds  and would have deposited it in the hands of Mr  Felton  to be distributed in charities among the objects of the place  but he desired it might be left with Mr  Norton  who was the proper person for managing his benevolence  and he promised to assist the deputy with his advice in laying it out             CHAPTER TWENTY TWO  IN WHICH CAPTAIN CROWE IS SUBLIMED INTO THE REGIONS ON ASTROLOGY   Three whole days had our adventurer prosecuted his inquiry about the amiable Aurelia  whom he sought in every place of public and of private entertainment or resort  without obtaining the least satisfactory intelligence  when he received one evening  from the hands of a porter  who instantly vanished  the following billet    If you would learn the particulars of Miss Darnel s fate fail not to be in the fields by the Foundling Hospital  precisely at seven o clock this evening  when you shall be met by a person who will give you the satisfaction you desire  together with his reason for addressing you in this mysterious manner    Had this intimation concerned any other subject  perhaps the knight would have deliberated with himself in what manner he should take a hint so darkly communicated  But his eagerness to retrieve the jewel he had lost divested him of all his caution  the time of assignation was already at hand  and neither the captain nor his nephew could be found to accompany him  had he been disposed to make use of their attendance  He therefore  after a moment s hesitation  repaired to the place appointed  in the utmost agitation and anxiety  lest the hour should be elapsed before his arrival   Crowe was one of those defective spirits who cannot subsist for any length of time on their own bottoms  He wanted a familiar prop  upon which he could disburden his cares  his doubts  and his humours  an humble friend who would endure his caprices  and with whom he could communicate  free of all reserve and restraint  Though he loved his nephew s person  and admired his parts  he considered him often as a little petulant jackanapes  who presumed upon his superior understanding  and as for Sir Launcelot  there was something in his character that overawed the seaman  and kept him at a disagreeable distance  He had  in this dilemma  cast his eyes upon Timothy Crabshaw  and admitted him to a considerable share of familiarity and fellowship  These companions had been employed in smoking a social pipe at an alehouse in the neighbourhood  when the knight made his excursion  and returning to the house about supper time  found Mr  Clarke in waiting   The young lawyer was alarmed when he heard the hour of ten  without seeing our adventurer  who had been used to be extremely regular in his economy  and the captain and he supped in profound silence  Finding  upon inquiry among the servants  that the knight went out abruptly  in consequence of having received a billet  Tom began to be visited with the apprehension of a duel  and sat the best part of the night by his uncle  sweating with the expectation of seeing our hero brought home a breathless corpse  But no tidings of him arriving  he  about two in the morning  repaired to his own lodging  resolved to publish a description of Sir Launcelot in the newspapers  if he should not appear next day   Crowe did not pass the time without uneasiness  He was extremely concerned at the thought of some mischief having befallen his friend and patron  and he was terrified with the apprehensions  that  in case Sir Launcelot was murdered  his spirit might come and give him notice of his fate  Now he had an insuperable aversion to all correspondence with the dead  and taking it for granted that the spirit of his departed friend could not appear to him except when he should be alone  and a bed in the dark  he determined to pass the remainder of the night without going to bed  For this purpose  his first care was to visit the garret  in which Timothy Crabshaw lay fast asleep  snoring with his mouth wide open  Him the captain with difficulty roused  by dint of promising to regale him with a bowl of rum punch in the kitchen  where the fire  which had been extinguished  was soon rekindled  The ingredients were fetched from a public house in the neighbourhood  for the captain was too proud to use his interest in the knight s family  especially at these hours  when all the rest of the servants had retired to their repose  and he and Timothy drank together until daybreak  the conversation turning upon hobgoblins  and God s revenge against murder   The cookmaid lay in a little apartment contiguous to the kitchen  and whether disturbed by these horrible tales of apparitions  or titillated by the savoury steams that issued from the punch bowl  she made a virtue of necessity
