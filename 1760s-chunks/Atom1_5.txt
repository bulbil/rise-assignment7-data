 Into the mass  destined to sway the sceptre  he infused  at the very article of conception  the spirit  which in course of strangulation had been expelled a posteriori from a goose  killed on purpose to regale the appetite of the mother  The animalcule  thus inspired  was    21 born  and succeeded to the throne  under the name of Got hama baba  His whole life and conversation was no other than a repetition of the humours he had displayed in his last character  He was rapacious  shallow  hotheaded  and perverse  in point of understanding  just sufficient to appear in public without a siavering bib  imbued with no knowledge  illumed by no sentiment  and warmed with no affection  except a blind attachment to the worship of Fakku basi  which seemed indeed to be a disease in his constitution  His heart was meanly selfish  and his disposition altogether unprincely   Of all his recreations  that which he delighted in most  was kicking the breech of his Cuboy  or prime minister  an exercise which he every day performed in private  It was therefore necessary that a Cuboy should be found to undergo this diurnal operation without repining  This was a circumstance    22 foreseen and provided for by Mercury  who  a little after the conception of Got hama baba  impregnated the ovum of a future Cuboy  and implanted in it a changling soul  which had successively passed through the bodies of an ass  a dottril  an apple woman  and a cow boy  It was diverting enough to see the rejoicings with which the birth of this Quanbuku  was celebrated  and still more so to observe the marks of fond admiration in the parents  as the soul of the cow boy proceeded to expand itself in the young Cuboy  This is a species of diversion we atoms often enjoy  We at different times behold the same spirit  hunted down in a hare  and cried up in an Hector  fawning in a prostitute  and bribing in a minister  breaking forth in a whistle at the plough  and in a sermon from the pulpit  impelling a hog to    23 the stye  and a counsellor to the cabinet  prompting a shoe boy to filch  and a patriot to harangue  squinting in a goat  and smiling in a matron   Tutors of all sorts were provided betimes for the young Quanbuku  but his genius rejected all cultivation  at least the crops it produced were barren and ungrateful  He was distinguished by the name of Fika kaka  and caressed as the heir of an immense fortune  Nay  he was really considered as one of the most hopeful young Quanbukus in the empire of Japan  for his want of ideas was attended with a total absence of pride  insolence  or any other disagreeable vice  indeed his character was founded upon negatives  He had no understanding  no oeconomy  no courage  no industry  no steadiness  no discernment  no vigour  no retention  He was reputed generous and good humoured  but was really profuse  chicken hearted  negligent  fickle     24 blundering  weak  and leaky  All these qualifications were agitated by an eagerness  haste  and impatience  that compleated the most ludicrous composition  which human nature ever produced  He appeared always in hurry and confusion  as if he had lost his wits in the morning  and was in quest of them all day —Let me whisper a secret to you  my good friend Peacock  All this bustle and trepidation proceeded from a hollowness in the brain  forming a kind of eddy  in which his animal spirits were hurried about in a perpetual swirl  Had it not been for this Lusus Naturoe  the circulation would not have been sufficient for the purposes of animal life  Had the whole world been searched by the princes thereof  it would not have produced another to have matched this half witted original  to whom the administration of a mighty empire was wholly consigned  Notwithstanding all the care that was    25 taken of his education  Fika kaka never could comprehend any art or science  except that of dancing bareheaded among the Bonzas at the great festival of Cambadoxi  The extent of his knowledge in arithmetic went no farther than the numeration of his ten fingers  In history  he had no idea of what preceded a certain treaty with the Chinese  in the reign of queen Syko  who died within his own remembrance  and was so ignorant of geography  that he did not know that his native country was surrounded by the sea  No system of morality could he ever understand  and of the fourteen sects of religion that are permitted in Japan  the only discipline he could imbibe was a superstitious devotion for Fakku basi  the temple of the white horse  This  indeed  was neither the fruit of doctrine  nor the result of reason  but a real instinct  implanted in his nature    26 for fulfilling the ends of providence  His person was extremely aukward  his eye vacant  though alarmed  his speech thick  and embarrassed  his utterance ungraceful  and his meaning perplexed  With much difficulty he learned to write his own name  and that of the Dairo  and picked up a smattering
