She therefore went up and began rummaging about everywhere  supposing perhaps that it was my receptacle for articles purloined in the house  Of course she did not forget to pull the straw about  and behold  there was my bag  Two hands in a dish and one in a purse  was not one of her proverbs  so that finding the contents in crowns and pistoles  she thought  or seemed to think  that the money was lawfully and honestly hers  At least she had possession  and that is nine points of the law  though scarcely one of honesty  But to do the thing decently  after calling me little wretch  little rascal  and so forth  she ordered the ostler  a fellow without any will but hers  to give me a hearty flogging  and then turn me out of doors  with this salt eel for my breakfast  and a lady like oath that no light  fingered gentry should ever darken her doors  In vain did I protest and vow that I never wronged my mistress  she affirmed the direct contrary  and her word would go further than mine at any time  Thus were friar Chrysostom s savings transferred from one thief to a greater thief in the thief taker   I wept over the loss of my money  as a father over the death of his only son  and though my tears could not bring back what I had lost  they at least answered the purpose of exciting pity in some people  who saw how bitterly they flowed  and among others in the parson  who was accidentally going by  He seemed affected by my sad plight  and took me home with him  There  to gain my confidence  or rather to pump me  he began soothing my sorrows  How much this poor child is to be pitied  said he  Is it any wonder if  thrown upon the wide world at so tender an age  he has committed a bad action  Grown up men are not always proof against the flesh or the devil  Then  addressing me  Child  added he  front what part of Spain do you come  and who are your parents  You have the look of family about you  Open your heart to me confidentially  and depend upon it  I never will desert you   His reverence  by this kind and insinuating language  engaged me by degrees to tell him all my history  without falsification or reserve  I owned everything  and thus he moralized on the leading article of my confession  My little friend  though hermits ought to lay up such treasures as neither force nor fraud can wrest from them  that was no excuse for your taking the measure of punishment into your own hands  by robbing brother Chrysostom  you nevertheless sinned against that article of the decalogue  which tells you not to steal  but I will engage to make the hostess return the money  and will punctually remit it to the reverend friar at his hermitage  you may therefore make your conscience perfectly easy on that score  Now  between ourselves  my conscience was perfectly callous to everything like compunction with respect to the crime in question  The parson  who had his own ends to answer  had not done with me yet  My lad  pursued he  I mean to take you by the hand  and find a good berth for you  I shall send you to morrow morning  by the carrier  to my nephew  a canon of Toledo  He will not refuse  at my request  to admit you upon his establishment  where they live like so many sons of the church  rosily  merrily  and fatly  upon the rents of his prebendal stall  you will be perfectly comfortable there  take my word for it   Patronage like this gave me so much encouragement  that I did not throw away another thought either upon my bag or my whipping  My mind was wholly occupied with the idea of living rosily  merrily  and fatly  like a son of the church  The following day  at breakfast time  there came  according to orders  a muleteer to the parsonage  with two mules saddled and bridled  They helped me to mount one  the muleteer flung his leg over the other  and we trotted on for Toledo  My fellow traveller was a good  pleasant companion  arid desired nothing better than to indulge his humour at the expense of his neighbour  My little volunteer  said he  you have a good friend in his reverence  the minister of Galves  He could not give you a better proof of his kindness  than by placing you with his nephew the canon  whom I have the honour of knowing  far beyond all question or comparison  to be the cock of the chapter  and a hearty one he is  None of your lantern jawed saints  with Lent in his face  a cat of nine tails on his back  and a cholera morbus in his belly  No such thing  Our doctor is rubicund in the jowl  efflorescent on the nose  with a wicked eye at a bumper or a girl militant against no earthly pleasure  but most addicted to the good things of the table  You will be as snug there as a bug
