muffs and tippets as the English  made the very same request to their monarch  and met with the same gracious reception from their king  who generously granted what was not his to give  Wherever the French landed  they called the country their own  and the English took possession wherever they came upon the same equitable pretensions  The harmless savages made no opposition  and could the intruders have agreed together  they might peaceably have shared this desolate country between them  But they quarrelled about the boundaries of their settlements  about grounds and rivers to which neither side could shew any other right than that of power  and which neither could occupy but by usurpation  Such is the contest  that no honest man can heartily wish success to either party   The war has continued for some time with various success  At first the French seemed victorious    61 but the English have of late dispossessed them of the whole country in dispute  Think not  however  that success on one side is the harbinger of peace  on the contrary  both parties must be heartily tired to effect even a temporary reconciliation  It should seem the business of the victorious party to offer terms of peace  but there are many in England  who  encouraged by success  are for still protracting the war   The best English politicians  however  are sensible  that to keep their present conquests  would be rather a burthen than an advantage to them  rather a diminution of their strength than an encrease of power  It is in the politic as in the human constitution  if the limbs grow too large for the body  their size  instead of improving  will diminish the vigour of the whole  The colonies should always bear an exact proportion to the mother country  when they grow populous  they grow powerful  and by becoming powerful  they become independent also  thus subordination is destroyed  and a country swallowed up in the extent of its own dominions  The Turkish empire would be more formidable  were it less extensive  Were it not for those countries  which it can neither command  nor give entirely away  which it is obliged to protect  but from which it has no power to exact obedience   Yet  obvious as these truths are  there are many Englishmen who are for transplanting new colonies into this late acquisition  for peopling the desarts of America with the refuse of their countrymen  and  as they express it  with the waste of an exuberant nation  But who are those unhappy   62 creatures who are to be thus drained away  Not the sickly  for they are unwelcome guests abroad as well as at home  nor the idle  for they would starve as well behind the Appalachian mountains as in the streets of London  This refuse is composed of the laborious and enterprising  of such men as can be serviceable to their country at home  of men who ought to be regarded as the sinews of the people  and cherished with every degree of political indulgence  And what are the commodities which this colony  when established  are to produce in return  Why raw silk  hemp  and tobacco  England  therefore  must make an exchange of her best and bravest subjects for raw silk  hemp  and tobacco  her hardy veterans and honest tradesmen  must be truck d for a box of snuff or a silk petticoat  Strange absurdity  Sure the politics of the Daures are not more strange  who sell their religion  their wives  and their liberty for a glass bead  or a paltry penknife  Farewell   LETTER XVIII  From the same   THE English love their wives with much passion  the Hollanders with much prudence  The English when they give their hands  frequently give their hearts  the Dutch give the hand  but keep the heart wisely in their own possession  The English love with violence  and expect violent love in return  the Dutch are satisfied with the slightest acknowledgments  for they give little   63 away  The English expend many of the matrimonial comforts in the first year  the Dutch frugally husband out their pleasures  and are always constant because they are always indifferent   There seems very little difference between a Dutch bridegroom and a Dutch husband  Both are equally possessed of the same cool unexpecting serenity  they can see neither Elysium nor Paradise behind the curtain  and Yiffrow is not more a goddess on the wedding night  than after twenty years matrimonial acquaintance  On the other hand  many of the English marry  in order to have one happy month in their lives  they seem incapable of looking beyond that period  they unite in hopes of finding rapture  and disappointed in that  disdain ever to accept of happiness  From hence we see open hatred ensue  or what is worse  concealed disgust under the appearance of fulsome endearment  Much formality  great civility  and studied compliments are exhibited in public  cross looks  sulky silence  or open recrimination  fill up their hours of private entertainment   Hence I am taught  whenever I see a new married couple more than ordinarily fond before faces  to consider them as attempting to impose upon the company or themselves  either hating each other heartily  or consuming that stock
