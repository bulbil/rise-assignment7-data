I make no doubt  to my imperfections  so long as I   mean well       My master made me dine with him  and would eat nothing but what I helped   him to  and my heart is  every hour  more and more enlarged with his   goodness and condescension  But still  what ails me  I wonder  A strange   sort of weight hangs upon my mind  as Thursday draws on  which makes   me often sigh involuntarily  and damps  at times  the pleasures of my   delightful prospects   I hope this is not ominous  but only the foolish   weakness of an over thoughtful mind  on an occasion the most solemn and   important of one s life  next to the last scene  which shuts up all       I could be very serious  But I will commit all my ways to that blessed   Providence  which hitherto has so wonderfully conducted me through real   evils to this hopeful situation       I only fear  and surely I have great reason  that I shall be too   unworthy to hold the affections of so dear a gentleman   God teach me   humility  and to know my own demerit  And this will be  next to his   grace  my surest guard  in the state of life to which  though most   unworthy  I am going to be exalted  And don t cease your prayers for   me  my dear parents  for  perhaps  this new condition may be subject   to still worse hazards than those I have escaped  as would be the case    were conceitedness  vanity  and pride  to take hold of my frail heart    and if I was  for my sins  to be left to my own conduct  a frail bark   in a tempestuous ocean  without ballast  or other pilot than my own   inconsiderate will  But my master said  on another occasion  That those   who doubted most  always erred least  and I hope I shall always doubt my   own strength  my own worthiness       I will not trouble you with twenty sweet agreeable things that passed in   conversation with my excellent benefactor  nor with the civilities of   M  Colbrand  Mrs  Jewkes  and all the servants  who seem to be highly   pleased with me  and with my conduct to them  And as my master    hitherto  finds no fault that I go too low  nor they that I carry it too   high  I hope I shall continue to have every body s good will  But yet   will I not seek to gain any one s by little meannesses or debasements    but aim at an uniform and regular conduct  willing to conceal   involuntary errors  as I would have my own forgiven  and not too   industrious to discover real ones  or to hide such  if any such should   appear  as might encourage bad hearts  or unclean hands  in material   cases  where my master should receive damage  or where the morals of the   transgressors should appear wilfully and habitually corrupt  In short  I   will endeavour  as much as I can  that good servants shall find in me a   kind encourager  indifferent ones be made better  by inspiring them with   a laudable emulation  and bad ones  if not too bad in nature  and quite   irreclaimable  reformed by kindness  expostulation  and even proper   menaces  if necessary  but most by a good example  All this if God   pleases          Wednesday       Now  my dear parents  I have but this one day between me and the most   solemn rite that can be performed  My heart cannot yet shake off this   heavy weight  Sure I am ungrateful to the divine goodness  and the   favour of the best of benefactors   Yet I hope I am not   For  at times    my mind is all exultation  with the prospect of what good to morrow s   happy solemnity may possibly  by the leave of my generous master  put it   in my power to do  O how shall I find words to express  as I ought  my   thankfulness  for all the mercies before me          Wednesday evening       My dear master is all love and tenderness  He sees my weakness  and   generously pities and comforts me  I begged to be excused supper  but   he brought me down himself from my closet  and placed me by him  bidding   Abraham not wait  I could not eat  and yet I tried  for fear he should   be angry  He kindly forbore to hint any thing of the dreadful  yet   delightful to morrow
