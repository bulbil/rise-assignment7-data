of you has embittered the remainder of my days  vouchsafe me at least the melancholy satisfaction of convincing you that I have not called down this misfortune on myself by my own inconstancy  I did indeed confirm the pledge of my hand to Constance  but then it was unavoidable in the situation to which your father s policy had reduced us  It was necessary to put this imposition on the princess for your interest and for my own  to secure to you your crown  and with it the hand and heart of your devoted lover  I had flattered myself with the prospect of success  Measures were already taken to supersede that engagement  but you have destroyed the bright illusions of my fancy  and  by disposing of yourself too precipitately  have antedated an eternity of torment for two hearts  whom a mutual and perfect love might have conducted to perpetual bliss   He concluded this explanation with such evident marks of unfeigned agony  that Blanche was affected by his words  She had no longer any hesitation about his innocence  At first her joy was unbounded at the conviction  but then again a sense of their cruel circumstances gained the ascendant over her mind  Ah  my honoured lord  said she to the prince  after such a determination of our destinies  you only inflict a new pang by informing me that you were not to blame  What have I done  wretched as I am  My keen resentment has betrayed me into error  I fancied myself cast off  and in the moment of my anger  accepted the hand of the constable  whose addresses my father promoted  But the crime is all my own  though the woes are mutual  Alas  In the very conjuncture when I accused you of deceiving me  it was by my own act  too credulously impassioned as I was  that the ties were broken  which I had sworn for ever to make indissoluble  Take your revenge  my lord  in your turn  Indulge your hatred against the ungrateful Blanche        Forget         What  and is it in my power then  madam  interrupted Enriquez with a dejected air  how is it possible to tear a passion from my heart  which even your injustice had not the power of extinguishing  Yet it becomes necessary for you to make that effort  my liege  replied the daughter of Siffredi  with a deep sigh         And shall you be equal to that effort yourself  replied the king  I am not confident with myself for my success  answered she  but I shall spare no pains in the attainment of my object  Ah  unfeeling fair one  said the prince  you will easily banish Enriquez from your remembrance  since you can contemplate such a purpose so steadfastly  Whither then does your imagination lead  said Blanche  in a more decisive tone  Do you flatter yourself that I can permit the continuance of your tender assiduities  No  my lord  banish that hope for ever from your thoughts  If I was not born for royalty  neither has heaven formed me to be degraded by illicit addresses  My husband  like yourself  my liege  is allied to the noble house of Anjou  Though the call of duty were less peremptory  in opposing an insurmountable obstacle to your insidious proposals  a sense of pride would hinder me from admitting them  I conjure you to withdraw  we must meet no more  What a barbarous sentence  exclaimed the king  Ah  Blanche  is it possible that you should treat me with so much severity  Is it not enough then to weigh me down  that the constable should be in possession of your charms  And yet you would cut me off from the bare sight of you  the only comfort which remains to me  For that very reason avoid my presence  answered Siffredi s daughter  not without some tears of tenderness  The contemplation of what we have dearly loved is no longer a blessing  when we have lost all hope of the possession  Adieu  my lord  Shun my very image  You owe that exertion to your own honour and to my good name  I claim it also for my own peace of mind  for to deal sincerely  though my virtue should be steady enough to combat with the suggestions of my heart  the very remembrance of your affection stirs up so cruel a conflict  that it is almost too much for my frail nature to support the shock   Her utterance of these words was attended with so energetic an action  as to overset the light placed on a table behind her  and its fall left the room in darkness  Blanche picked it up  She then opened the door of the ante chamber  and went to Nisa s closet  who was not yet gone to bed  for the purpose of lighting it again  She was now returning  after having accomplished her errand  The king  who was waiting for her impatiently  no sooner saw her approach  than he resumed his ardent plea with her  to allow of his attentions  At the prince s voice  the constable rushed impetuously  sword in hand  into the room  almost at the same moment with
