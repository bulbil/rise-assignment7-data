undertake this perilous commission till a valiant and   noble youth  named Araspes  stood forth      From my infancy  O Cyrus   said the graceful adventurer  I have         166 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      been educated in the school  and brought up at the feet  of the   divine Zoroaster  I am accustomed from my childhood to combat    conquer  and scorn all sensual seducers  I hold virtue in mine eye   as its only object   my heart esteems and affects it as my only   good   the nature thereof has become one with my nature   and I   do not remember the time wherein I have been tempted to   deviate from rectitude  or sink beneath the calls of honour  I   cannot therefore but smile at the fear of my companions  Their   courage at a breach or in the field is unquestionable  I have seen   them face a thousand deaths   I have seen them rush into dangers     and yet they dread the sight of a single and weakly female  For   me she can have no terrors  since I am out of the power and   reach of her allurements  I will undertake the charge of this for    midable creature at the risk of my honour  at the risk of my life    and more than all  at the risk of the favour of Cyrus      Cyrus had long loved the person  and contemplated and admired   the virtues of this youth  He therefore  with joy and confidence    committed the precious deposit to his trust   in full assurance that   the person and honour of Panthea could nowhere be so safe as in   the protection of Araspes      The young hero had in reality all the virtues that he boasted    His education under so beloved and respectable a master   his early   and long habit of opposing and rejecting the smallest incitement to   vice   and the delights which he was accustomed to feel in the   sentiments and practice of what his judgment approved had in a   manner so wholly lulled his naughty self to sleep  that he did not   so much as dream that he had an enemy within him      This  my Harry  was his heavy misfortune  and the sad occasion   of his fall  For  not knowing that his evil Esau was still alive in   his bosom   not knowing that he had any one to oppose or to   struggle with he kept neither watch nor guard  and so lay naked   and open to the mischief that came upon him  as I am going to tell   you      On his seeing the lady who was committed to his trust  he felt   no emotion nor sentiment save that of wonder  as in beholding the   most perfect of the works of his Creator   and he took a pleasure   in providing that she should be treated and accommodated with   all possible attention and respect  as due to so accomplished and   pre eminent a being      As the nature of his commission gave him frequent occasion of   being near and about the person of his amiable ward  new beauties   grew daily visible and open to his eyes  But  above all  in con    versing with her  the music of her accents and the elegance of her   sentiments fell insensibly on his soul  that drank them up as a dry   ground drinks up the invisible dew of the evening      His occasions for attending her  and doing little offices and ser    vices about her  now daily increased without seeming to do so     When he was called  and intended to go elsewhere  his feet imper    ceptibly carried him to the presence of Panthea  His slumbers   were short  uneasy  and broken  and at meals he knew not   whether or on what he fed      At length his eyes opened to the calamity of his condition  But         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  167     at the moment wherein he perceived his love  he found himself   too far gone for the possibility of a return  He was as a mariner   who had haled his boat upon land  and  thinking himself secure    had fallen asleep therein   but while he slept  a spring tide came   silently on and covered the shore  and gained upon the beach    and swelled under the boat  and heaved it from land  and turning    bore it farther and farther to sea  Then awakened the helpless   mariner  unprovided of sail or oar  or of any means to effect or   attempt a return  He saw his lost estatehe stretched his arms   towards the land
