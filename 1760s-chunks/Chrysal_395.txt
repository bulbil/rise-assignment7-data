the advantages of his country  which that enthusiastic ambition   from whence proceed the greatest actions  made him think himself   the most capable  and wish to be the happy instrument of promoting      By this gentleman my master was received with that oiviUty   which is commonly mistaken for esteem  After some general chat   on the occurrences and humour of the times  in which my master   modestly took to himself the merit of the people s discontent at the       Lord Temple  who applied for a writ of habeas corpus in favour of   Wilkes  and on receiving the King s commands to deprive Wilkes of   hia commission in the Militia  did so in such a complimentary manner   that he was deprived of the Lord Lieutenancy of Buckinghamshire  He   was the brother of George Greuville and brother in law of Pitt  with   whom he was always cordially allied  readily using his immense wealth   in the campaign against Bute s government          476 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     ministry and their measures as raised solely by his pamphlet â€”   I   allow the good effects of it    said the gentleman    and greatly   approve the principles upon which it is written   but I much fear   that your zeal has transported you too far  You should of all things   have avoided involving the master in your charge against the min    isters  because that alone can give them any advantage against   you  and is therefore what they always feign  however unjustly    when they are attacked  in order to screen themselves behind him    Besides  the character of a sovereign is sacred  and should never   be treated but with the highest respect  especially when the virtues   of the man are such as would be respectable in any character        Such disapprobation from his principal patron greatly disappointed   my master  who was so little acquainted with his sentiments as to   think he bore resentment against his sovereign for the loss of his   favour  as well as against those who had deprived him of it  and   consequently would be pleased with anything that might seem to   reflect disgrace upon him  Recovering himself  however  before   his embarrassment was perceived â€”   I imagined    answered he with   his usual presence of mind    that it was impossible to accuse me   of disrespect to one whom I have studiously sought every occasion   of praising  As for what you take notice of  my charge is not   personally against him  but through him  against those who had   the baseness and insolence to abuse his goodness and confidence   in such a manner   so that I think it is impossible to wrest it to   the purpose you apprehend          I wish you may not be mistaken  but I much fear that your   argument will not have the weight you expect  Praise  given with   an air of irony  is the keenest insult   besides  in this particular   case  the praises you bestow upon his goodness are all at the expense   of his understanding  However  do not be dispirited at what cannot   now be helped  As I think your intention was not in fault  you   may depend upon my countenance and support  let what will   happen        This comfortable assurance restored my master to his former   spirits  Not desiring  however  to continue the conversation any   longer upon that subject â€”   I have this morning    said he    made no   inconsiderable addition to our force  My friend  the poet  whose   turn for satire I have heard you so much admire  has promised me   to exert all his powers in our cause  He will attack the faults in   their private  wliile I expose their public characters  and experience   has shown that it is easy to overcome the minister  when the man   is made ridiculous or odious          The former I U grant you   but we have too many instances   in contradiction to the latter to build much upon it  However    bis powers are great  and may do much  if he will take care to avoid   the rock upon which you have fallen   and  therefore  I shall be   glad to attach him seriously to us  especially as he does not seem to   be utterly void of virtue  notwithstanding the libertinism of his   conduct ia some instances        My master would not miss so favourable an opportunity of doing   justice to the character of his friend  Accordingly  he related the   story of the distresses of the officer and his family  and his
