detested the arrogance and presumption of the other  In an assembly of sensible men  his talents would have shone with superior lustre  but at the council of Twenty Eight  they were obscured by the thick clouds of ignorance that enveloped his brethren  The Dairo had a personal respect for him  and is said to have conferred frequent favours on his posteriors in private  He kicked the Cuboy often ex officio  as a husband thinks it incumbent upon    67 him to caress his wife  but he kicked the president for pleasure  as a voluptuary embraces his mistress  Soo san sin o  conscious that he had no family interest to support him in cabals among the people  and careless of his country s fate  resolved to enjoy the comforts of life in quiet  He laughed and quaffed with his select companions in private  received his appointments thankfully  and swam with the tide of politicks as it happened to flow —It was pretty extraordinary that the wisest man should be the greatest cypher  but such was the will of the gods   Besides these great luminaries that enlightened the cabinet of Japan  I shall have occasion  in the course of my narrative  to describe many other stars of an inferior order  At this board  there was as great a variety of characters  as we find in the celebrated table of Cebes  Nay  indeed  what was objected to the philosopher     68 might have been more justly said of the Japonese councils  There was neither invention  unity  nor design among them  They consisted of mobs of sauntering  strolling  vagrant  and ridiculous politicians  Their schemes were absurd  and their deliberations like the sketches of anarchy  All was bellowing  bleating  braying  grinning  grumbling  confusion  and uproar  It was more like a dream of chaos than a picture of human life  If the ΔΑΙΜΩΝ  or Genius was wanting  it must be owned that Fika kaka exactly answered Cebes s description of ΤΥΧΗ  or Fortune  blind and frantic  running about every where  giving to some  and taking from others  without rule or distinction  while her emblem of the round stone  fairly shews his giddy nature  〈 in non Latin alphabet 〉  Here  however  one might have seen many other figures of the painter s allegory  such as Deception tendering the cup of ignorance and    69 error  opinions and appetites  Disappointment and Anguish  Debauchery  Profligacy  Gluttony  and Adulation  Luxury  Fraud  Rapine  Perjury  and Sacrilege  but not the least traces of the virtues which are described in the groupe of true education  and in the grove of happiness   The two factions that divided the council of Japan  tho  inveterate enemies to each other  heartily and cordially concurred in one particular  which was the worship established in the temple of Fakkubasi  or the White Horse  This was the orthodox faith in Japan  and was certainly founded  as St  Paul saith of the Christian religion  upon the evidence of things not seen  All the votaries of this superstition of Fakkubasi subscribed and swore to the following creed  implicitly  without hesitation  or mental reservation     I believe in the White Horse  that he descended    70 from heaven  and sojourned in Jeddo  which is the land of promise  I believe in Bupo his apostle  who first declared to the children of Niphon  the glad tidings of the gospel of Fakkubasi  I believe that the White Horse was begot by a black mule  and brought forth by a green dragon  that his head is of silver  and his hoofs are of brass  that he eats gold as provender  and discharges diamonds as dung  that the Japonese are ordained and predestined to furnish him with food  and the people of Jeddo to clear away his litter  I believe that the island of Niphon is joined to the continent of Jeddo  and that whoever thinks otherwise shall be damned to all eternity  I believe that the smallest portion of matter may be practically divided ad infinitum  that equal quantities taken from equal quantities  an unequal quantity will remain  that two and two make seven  that the sun rules    71 the night  the stars the day  and the moon is made of green cheese  Finally  I believe that a man cannot be saved without devoting his goods and his chattels  his children  relations  and friends  his senses and ideas  his soul and his body  to the religion of the White Horse  as it is prescribed in the ritual of Fakkubasi    These are the tenets which the Japonese ministers swallowed as glib as the English clergy swallow the thirty nine articles     Having thus characterised the chiefs that disputed the administration  or  in other words  the empire of Japan  I shall now proceed to a plain narration of historical incidents  without pretending to philosophize like H—e  or dogmatize like S—tt  I shall only tell thee  Nathaniel  that Britain never gave birth but to two historians worthy of credit  and they were Taliessin and Geoffrey of Monmouth  I ll    72 tell you another secret  The whole world has never been able to produce six good
