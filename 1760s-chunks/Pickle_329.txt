 with equal truth  spirit  and  severity  Though his name did not appear in the title page of this  production  he managed matters so that the work was universally  imputed to the true author  who was not altogether disappointed in his  expectations of success  for the impression was immediately sold off   and the piece became the subject of conversation in all assemblies of  taste     6 22 15  3 45 PM   This happy exordium not only attracted the addresses of the booksellers   who made interest for his acquaintance  but also roused the notice of a  society of authors  who styled themselves  The College   from which  he was honoured with a deputation  offering to enroll him a member by  unanimous consent  The person employed for this purpose being a bard  who had formerly tasted of our hero s bounty  used all his eloquence to  persuade him to comply with the advances of their fraternity  which  he described in such a manner as inflamed the curiosity of Pickle  who  dismissed the ambassador  with an acknowledgment of the great honour  they conferred upon him  and a faithful promise of endeavouring to merit  the continuance of their approbation   He was afterwards  by the same minister  instructed in the ceremonies of  the college  and  in consequence of his information  composed an ode   to be publicly recited on the evening of his introduction  He understood  that this constitution was no other than a body of authors  incorporated  by mutual consent  for their joint advantage and satisfaction   opposed to another assembly of the same kind  their avowed enemies and  detractors  No wonder  then  that they sought to strengthen themselves  with such a valuable acquisition as our hero was likely to prove  The  college consisted of authors only  and these of all degrees in point  of reputation  from the fabricator of a song  set to music  and sung at  Marylebone  to the dramatic bard who had appeared in buskins upon the  stage  nay  one of the members had actually finished eight books of an  epic poem  for the publication of which he was at that time soliciting  subscriptions   It cannot be supposed that such a congregation of the sons of Apollo  would sit a whole evening with order and decorum  unless they were under  the check of some established authority  and this inconvenience having  been foreseen  they had elected a president  vested with full power to  silence any member or members that should attempt to disturb the harmony  and subordination of the whole  The sage  who at this time possessed the  chair  was a person in years  whose countenance was a lively portraiture  of that rancorous discontent which follows repeated damnation  He had  been extremely unfortunate in his theatrical productions  and was  to  use the words of a profane wag  who assisted at the condemnation of his  last play  by this time d  d beyond redemption  Nevertheless  he still  tarried about the skirts of Parnassus  translating some of the classics   and writing miscellanies  and by dint of an invincible assurance   supercilious insolence  the most undaunted virulence of tongue  and some  knowledge of life  he made shift to acquire and maintain the character  of a man of learning and wit  in the opinion of people who had neither   that is  thirty nine in forty of those with whom he associated himself   He was even looked upon in this light by some few of the college  though  the major part of those who favoured his election  were such as dreaded  his malice  respected his experience and seniority  or hated his  competitor  who was the epic poet   The chief end of this society  as I have already hinted  was to assist  and support each other in their productions  which they mutually  recommended to sale  with all their art and influence  not only in  private conversation  but also in occasional epigrams  criticisms  and  advertisements  inserted in the public papers  This science  which is  known by the vulgar appellation of puffing  they carried to such a pitch  of finesse  that an author very often wrote an abusive answer to his own    6 22 15  3 45 PM   performance  in order to inflame the curiosity of the town  by which  it had been overlooked  Notwithstanding this general unanimity in the  college  a private animosity had long subsisted between the two rivals  I have mentioned  on account of precedence  to which both laid claim   though  by a majority of votes  it had been decided in favour of the  present chairman  The grudge indeed never proceeded to any degree of  outrage or defiance  but manifested itself at every meeting  in attempts  to eclipse each other in smart sayings and pregnant repartee  so that  there was always a delicate mess of this kind of wit served up in the  front of the evening  for the entertainment and example of the junior  members  who never failed to divide upon this occasion
