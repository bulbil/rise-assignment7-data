and destroyed us in his esteem  He began rather to think  not without reason  that we had some little design to impose on his credulity  Nevertheless he acted on this occasion in the spirit of a man of honour and a gentleman  My good friend and protector  said he to the alguazil  your conjectures may be without foundation  on the other hand  they may turn out to have too much truth in them  Whichever of these alternatives may be the fact  let us not look too curiously into their characters  They are both young  and have time enough for amendment if they want it  let them go their ways  and withdraw whithersoever it may best please them  Make no opposition  I beseech you  to their safe egress  it is a favour which you may consider as done to me  and my motive for asking it is to acquit myself of my debt to them  If my heart was not too soft for my profession  answered the alguazil  I should lodge these pretty gentlemen in limbo  in defiance of all your pleadings in their favour  but your eloquence and my susceptibility have relaxed the stern demeanour of justice for this evening  Let them  however  leave town on the spur of the occasion  for if I come across them to morrow  and there is any faith in an alguazil  they shall see such sport as will be no sport to them   When it was signified to Moralez and me  culprits as we were  that we were to be let off scot free  we polished up the brass upon our foreheads a little  It was time now to bounce and swagger  and to maintain that we were men of undeniable respectability  but the alguazil looked askew at us  and muttered that least said was soonest mended  I do not know how  but those gentry have a strange knack of curbing our genius  they are complete lords of the ascendant  Florence and her dowry therefore were lost to Pedro de la Membrilla by a turn of the dice  and we may conclude that he was received as the son in law of Jerome de Moyadas  I took to my heels with my companion  We blundered on the road to Truxillo  with the consolation at our hearts of having at least pocketed a hundred pistoles by our frolic  An hour before night fall we passed through a little village with the intention of putting up for the evening at the next stage  An inn of very tolerable appearance for the place attracted our notice  The landlord and landlady were sitting at the door  on a long bench such as usually graces a pot house porch  Our host  a tall man  withered  and with one foot in the grave  was tinkling on a cracked guitar to the unbounded emolument of his wife  whose faculties seemed to hang in rapture on the performance  Gentlemen  cried out the intrepid tavern keeper  when he found that we were not upon the halt  you will do well to stop here  you may fare worse further off  There is a devil of a three leagues to the nearest village  and you will find nothing to make you amends for what you leave behind  you may assure yourselves of that  Take a word of advice  know when you are well used  I will treat you with the fat of the land  and charge you at the lowest rate  There was no resisting such a plea  We came up to our courteous entertainers  paid them the compliments of course  and sitting down by their side  the conversation was supported by all four on the indifferent topics of the day  Our host announced himself as an officer of the Holy Brotherhood  and his rib was a fat laughing squab of a woman  withoutward good nature  but with an eye to make the most of her commodities   Our discourse was broken in upon by the arrival of from twelve to fifteen riders  some mounted on mules  others on horseback  followed by about thirty sumpter mules laden with packages  Ah  what a princely retinue  exclaimed the landlord at the sight of so much company  where can I put them all  In an instant the village was crammed full of men and beasts  As luck would have it  there was near the inn an immense barn  where the sumpter mules and their packages were secured  the saddle mules and horses were taken care of in other places  As for their masters  they thought less about bespeaking beds than about calling for the bill of fare  and ordering a good supper  The host and hostess  with a servant girl whom they kept  were all upon the alert to make things agreeable  They laid a heavy hand upon all the fowls in the poultry yard  These precious roasts  with some undisguised rabbits  cats in the masquerade of a fricassee  and a deluging tureen of soup  stinking of cabbage and greasy with mutton fat  were enough to have given a sickener to the inveterate stomachs of a regiment   As for Moralez and myself  we cast a scrutinizing eye on these troopers  nor were they behindhand in passing their secret judgments upon us  At last we came together in conversation  and it was proposed on our part  if
