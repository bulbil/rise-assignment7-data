nunnery  instead of coming straight home  he walked backwards and forwards in the street  It was almost a moot point with me what I ought to do  At last  I resolved on accosting Don Balthazar  though neither of us had the slightest knowledge of each other  Noble gentleman  said I  you would do me a most particular favour by leaving the street vacant to me for this one night  I would do as much for you another time  Sir  answered he  I was just going to make the same request to you  I am on the look out after a girl  over whom a confounded fellow of a brother keeps watch and ward like a gaoler  and she lives not twenty yards from this place  I could wish to carry on my project without a witness  We have the means  replied I  of attaining both our ends without clashing  for the lady of my desires lives there  added I  pointing to his own house  We had better even help one another  in case of being attacked  With all my heart  resumed he  I will go to my appointment  and we will make common cause if need be  Under this pretence he went away  but only to observe me the more narrowly  and the darkness of the night favoured his doing so without detection   As for me  I made up to Violante s balcony in the simplicity of my heart  She soon heard my signal  and we began our usual parley  I was not remiss in pressing the idol of my worship to grant me a private interview in some safe and practicable place  She was rather coy to my entreaties  as favours hardly earned are the higher valued  at length she took a letter out of her pocket  and flung it down to me  There  said she  you will find in that scrap of paper the promise of what you have teased me so long about  She then withdrew  as the hour approached when her husband usually came home  I put the note up carefully  and went towards the place where Don Balthazar had told me that his business lay  But that staunch husband  with the sagacity of an old sportsman where his own wife was the game  came more than half way to meet me  with this question  Well  good sir  are you satisfied with your happy fortunes  I have reason to be so  answered I  And as for yourself  what have you done  has the blind god befriended you  Alas  quite the contrary  replied he  that impertinent brother  who takes such liberties with my beauty  thought fit to come back from his country house  whence we hugged ourselves as sure that he would not return till to morrow  This infernal chance has put all my soft and soothing pleasures out of tune   Nothing could exceed the mutual pledges of lasting friendship which were exchanged between Don Balthazar and me  To draw the cords the closer  we made an appointment for the next morning in the great square  This plotting gentleman  after we had parted  betook himself to his own house  without giving Violante at all to understand that he knew more about her than she wished him  On the following day he was punctual in the great square  and I was not five minutes after him  We exchanged greetings with all the warmth of old friendship  but it was a vapour to mislead on his part  though a spark of heavenly flame on mine  In the course of conversation  this hypocritical Don Balthazar palmed upon me a fictitious confidence  respecting his intrigue with the lady about whom he had been speaking the night before  He put together a long story he had been manufacturing on that subject  and all this to hook me in to tell him  in return  by what means I had got acquainted with Violante  The snare was too subtle for me to escape  I owned all with the innocence of a new born babe  I did not even stick at shewing the note I had received from her  and read the contents  to the following purport   I am going to  morrow to dine with Donna Inez  You know where she lives  It is in the house of that confidential friend that I mean to pass some happy moments along with you  It is impossible longer to refuse a boon your patience has so well merited    Here indeed  said Don Balthazar  is an epistle which promises to crown all your wishes at once  I congratulate you beforehand on your approaching happiness  He could not help fidgeting and wriggling a little  while he talked in these terms of his own household  but all his hitches and wry faces passed off  and my eyes were as fast sealed as ever  I was so full of anticipating titillations  as not to think of noticing my new friend  who was obliged to get off as fast as be could  for fear of betraying his agitation in my presence  He ran to acquaint his brother in law with this strange occurrence  I know not what might pass between them  it is only certain that Don Balthazar happened to knock at Donna Inca s door  just when I was at that lady s
