or chicanery    on which occasions  no doubt  he dealt himself many a   hearty blow on the head  which told fatally against his   future interest  and killed downright any hope of prefer    ment for him on the part of the Government   The   Quixotism of The Fool of Quality was not more thorough   than that of Henry Brooke  Undoubtedly  in this case   the book is the man      1 There is  however  some doubt as to whether it was not Phillips    town of which he was barrack master  Vide Magazine of Magazines    Limerick   Promotion  May 8  1756  Nicholas Crawford  Gent     appointed barrack master of district of Phillipstown  Henry Brooke    Esq   resigned    On the other hand  the various memoirs of Henry   Brooke state that he was barrack master of Mullinpar at the time of     5 death  At Phillipstown  thirty two miles from Dublin  there were   barracks for a company of foot  Formerly it had been a garrison    Possibly Brooke was promoted thence to Mullingar          INTRODUCTION xv     The year of his father s death was that of the Jacobite   Rebellion  The followers of Charles Edward had overrun   Scotland  won the battle of Prestonpans  and invaded   England  In 1746  when the rebellion was still running   its course  Brooke published his Farmer s Letters  calling   attention to the perpetual source of danger to the country   that existed in Ireland in the irreconcilable Catholics  who   outnumbered the Protestants by five to one  and were   ready  now as ever  to rise against their English conquerors   whenever they received the least support or encouragement   from outside  Later events have proved the justice of   Brooke s reading of history  and his diagnosis of the   general situation  He surveys the course of English   history as a protracted struggle between the instinct of   liberty and the forces of oppression  tracing the sinister   influence of the Papacy throughout  and pointing out that   the return of the Stuarts would mean a revival of the   principle of absolute monarchy  and the possible overthrow   of the Protestant establishment    This common enemy     he declares    is now at hand  He is our enemy by nature   as well as education  and my intent is to prove that  were   it possible for him to prevail  the consequence to us would   be the same as if this whole frame of heaven and earth was   to be broken and thrown into its first darkness and con    fusion   for such is the antipathy between a Popish prince   and Protestant subjects  and such would be the ruin of all   our interests  and the utter subversion of our State   But   the time for such a revolution had long passed away  at   least in England   the letters were hardly in print before   the Jacobite Rebellion collapsed  and the cause of the   Stuarts and of a Catholic reaction was lost for ever  But   in Ireland the danger from the oppressed Catholics yet   remained a danger that was still being fomented by the   mistakes and downright tyranny of the English  as Brooke   very fairly demonstrated in a later work  A specimen of   his powers of argument  with the declamatory eloquence   into which he continually rises  may be quoted       I have already represented to you  in two former letters  the great   and heavy dangers that impend over us and our posterity from the   power of France and Spain  the principles of our inmate enemies  and   the intrigues of the Church of Rome  who  like the world  the flesh    and the devil  make up a triple alliance of strength  intimacy  and   craft sufficient for as formidable a war as ever was waged against   religion and liberty  I have also shown you how the Church of Rome    like that arch politician  makes use of both the other powers to reduce         xvi INTRODUCTION     us by force  or circumvent us by treachery   that  as she is ambitious   of being the prince of this world  she aims at the perversion of all   mankind   that she has already seduced millions to her state of perdi    tion   that  for many ages  she has attempted these kingdoms of light   and liberty  and that now  once for all  she makes her grand effort     she exerts all her influence and summons all her powers to subdue us   to her dominion of darkness and chains  to which the descent is easy    but from whence there is no redemption
