 she took that opportunity          1 53       of retiring to her apartment  and we saw no more of her till dinner  when she was gracious to Harry  and exceedingly stately to me      O mon Dieu  I had almost forgot  we are to have a little concert this evening  and see  my dear Lord appears to summon me  Adio  Caro   A  Wilmot      To Henry Mandeville  Esq      YES  my dear son  you do me justice  I am never so happy as when I know you are so  I perfectly agree with you as to the charms of Lord Belmont s hermitage  and admire that genuine taste for elegant nature  which gives such a spirited variety to the life of the wisest and most amiable of men        But does it not  my dear Harry  give you at the same time a very contemptible          1 54       idea of the power of greatness to make its possessors happy  to see it thus flying as it were from itself  and seeking pleasure not in the fruition  but in the temporary suspension  of those supposed advantages it has above other conditions of life  Believe me  it is not in the costly dome  but in the rural cott  that the impartial Lord of all has fixed the chearful seat of happiness  Health  peace  content  and soft domestic tenderness  the only real sweets of life  driven from the gilded palace  smile on the humble roof of virtuous industry      The poor complain not of the tediousness of life  their daily toil makes short the flying hours  and every moment of rest from labour is to them a moment of enjoyment  Not so the great  surrounded from earliest youth by pleasures which court their acceptance  their taste palled by habit and the too great facility of satiating every wish  lassitude and disgust creep          1 55       on their languid hours  and  wanting the doubtful gale of hope to keep the mind in gentle agitation  it sinks into a dead calm  more destructive to every enjoyment than the rudest storm of adversity  The haughty dutchess  oppressed with tasteless pomp  and sinking under the weight of her own importance  is much less to be envyed than  the milk maid singing blithe   who is in her eyes the object only of pity and contempt      Your acquaintance with the great world  my dear Harry  has shewn you the splendid misery of superior life  you have seen those most wretched to whom Heaven has granted the amplest external means of happiness  Miserable slaves to pride  the most corroding of human passions  strangers to social pleasure  incapable of love or friendship  living to others not to themselves  ever in pursuit of the shadow of happiness  whilst the substance glides past them unobserved           1 56       they drag on an insipid joyless being  unloved and unconnected  scorning the tender ties which give life all its sweetness  they sink unwept and unlamented to the grave  They know not the conversation of a friend  that conversation which  brightens the eyes   their pride  an invasion on the natural rights of mankind  meets with perpetual mortification  and their rage for dissipation  like the burning thirst of a fever  is at once boundless and unquenchable      Yet  though happiness loves the vale  it would be unjust to confine her to those humble scenes  nor is her presence  as our times afford a shining and amiable example  unattainable to Royalty itself  the wife and good  whate er their rank  led by the hand of simple unerring nature  are seldom known to miss their way to her delightful abode            1 57          You have seen Lord Belmont  blest with wisdom to chuse  and fortune to pursue his choice  convinced that wealth and titles  the portion of few  are not only foreign to  but often inconsistent with  true happiness  seek the lovely goddess  not in the pride of show  the pomp of courts  or the madness of dissipation  but in the calm of retirement  in the bosom of friendship  in the sweets of dear domestic life  in the tender pleasing duties of husband and of father  in the practice of beneficence and every gentler virtue  Others may be like him convinced  but few like him have spirit and resolution to burst the magic fetters of example and fashion  and nobly dare to be happy        What pleasure does it give me to find you in so just a way of thinking in regard to fortune  yes  my dear Harry  all that in reality deserves the name of good  so far as it centers in ourselves  is within          1
