directly  to the house of Sophy s father  and  affecting an air of surprise and  consternation  to which he had never before been subject  thundered at  the door with such an alarming knock  as in a moment brought the whole  family into the hall  When he was admitted  he began to gape  stare  and  pant at the same time  and made no reply  when Godfrey asked what was  the matter  till Mrs  Gauntlet expressed her apprehensions about his  master  When Pickle s name was mentioned  he seemed to make an effort to  speak  and  in a bellowing tone  pronounced   Brought himself up  split  my topsails   So saying  he pointed to his own neck  and rose upon his  tiptoes  by way of explaining the meaning of his words   Godfrey  without staying to ask another question  rushed out  and flew  towards the inn  with the utmost horror and concern  while Sophy  who  did not rightly understand the language of the messenger  addressing  herself to him a second time  said   I hope no accident has happened  to Mr  Pickle     No accident at all   replied Tom   he has only hanged  himself for love   These words had scarcely proceeded from his mouth   when Emilia  who stood listening at the parlour door  shrieked aloud   and dropped down senseless upon the floor  while her sister  who  was almost equally shocked at the intelligence  had recourse to the  assistance of her maid  by whom she was supported from falling  Pipes   hearing Emily s voice  congratulated himself upon the success of his  stratagem  He sprung to her assistance  and  lifting her up into an easy  chair  stood by her  until he saw her recover from her swoon  and heard  her call upon his master s name  with all the frenzy of despairing love   Then he bent his course back to the inn  overjoyed at the opportunity of  telling Peregrine what a confession he had extorted from his mistress   and extremely vain of this proof of his own sagacity     6 22 15  3 45 PM   In the meantime Godfrey arriving at the house in which he supposed this  fatal catastrophe had happened  ran upstairs to Peregrine s chamber   without staying to make any inquiry below  and  finding the door locked   burst it open with one stroke of his foot  But what was his amazement   when  upon entrance  our hero  starting up from the bed  saluted him  with a boisterous exclamation of  Zounds  who s there   He was struck  dumb with astonishment  which also riveted him to the place where he  stood  scarce crediting the testimony of his own senses  till Peregrine   with an air of discontent  which denoted him displeased with his  intrusion  dispelled his apprehension by a second address  saying   I  see you consider me as a friend  by your using me without ceremony    The soldier  thus convinced of the falsehood of the information he had  received  began to imagine  that Pickle had projected the plan which was  executed by his servant  and looking upon it as a piece of unjustifiable  finesse  which might be attended with very melancholy consequences to  his sister or wife  he answered  in a supercilious tone  that Mr   Pickle must blame himself for the interruption of his repose  which was  entirely owing to the sorry jest he had set on foot   Pickle  who was the child of passion  and more than half mad with  impatience before this visit  hearing himself treated in such a cavalier  manner  advanced close up to Godfrey s breast  and assuming a stern  or  rather frantic countenance   Hark ye  sir   said he   you are mistaken  if you think I jest  I am in downright earnest  I assure you   Gauntlet   who was not a man to be browbeaten  seeing himself thus bearded by a  person of whose conduct he had  he thought  reason to complain  put on  his military look of defiance  and  erecting his chest  replied with  an exalted voice   Mr  Pickle  whether you were in jest or earnest   you must give me leave to tell you  that the scheme was childish   unseasonable  and unkind  not to give it a harsher term     Death  sir    cried our adventurer   you trifle with my disquiet  if there is any  meaning in your insinuation  explain yourself  and then I shall know  what answer it will befit me to give     I came with very different  sentiments   resumed the soldier   but since you urge me to  expostulation  and behave with such unprovoked loftiness of displeasure   I will  without circumlocution  tax you with having committed an outrage  upon the peace of my family  in sending your fellow to alarm us with
