I find a thought of so dishonourable a nature rising in my bosom  I should do instant justice on the traytor  and stab it to the heart     Your mother made no reply to this but by a shower of tears  which your father being utterly unable to withstand  he flew out of the room  leaving me to give the dear lady what consolation I could  which in fact was but very   19 trifling  as I stood in no little need of consolation myself  Such  my sweet friend  is the state of matters at Mildmay Hall  Your brother  though his wounds pain him considerably  slept a full hour this evening  so Butler just now acquainted me  adding  that he and the surgeon were to sit up all night with him  and assuring me that there should be no want of attendance on either of their parts — As for myself   says Butler    I shall have but little inclination to sleep while my poor master continues in any danger  and as for the surgeon  I will take care that he shall wake whenever there is the smallest necessity for his assistance   So saying  he gave a significant look  as if he should be angry with the gentleman in case of any neglect  and marched off to the housekeeper for some old linen to cut up in bandages  You desired me  at the conclusion of your letter  to inform   20 you  whether there is any other visitor at the Hall—It is with pleasure I can acquaint you that there is not  The morning after your departure  messengers were sent to every body invited  but myself  to let them know that an unexpected circumstance had happened  which must delay the wedding for some time  but that they should receive early intelligence against the day of celebration  And now  my dearest Louisa  let me again insist that you will bear up with all your fortitude against the hand of adversity—Fortune  believe me  will yet wear a propitious countenance  and we shall all experience a degree of happiness in proportion to the severity of our present distress  Your mother  my sweet girl  on her reverend knees  with streaming eyes  and uplifted hands  is this moment blessing you  such a woman s prayers to the Throne of Mercy must be effectual —Providence looks with   21 delight upon all parental supplications  but where a parent is peculiarly distinguished for every virtue  the petition is sanctified into a kind of claim  and is no sooner pronounced than rewarded  Good night  sister of my soul  my ever amiable Louisa  By the next post you shall hear from me again  and I hope infinitely more to your satisfaction     HARRIOT BEAUCLERK     22  LETTER XIV  Miss MILDMAY to her Mother    IF I have yet delayed paying my humblest duty to my ever revered mama  if I have yet denied myself the unspeakable satisfaction of approaching her by letter  it was neither from a want of the deepest respect  nor the strongest inclination —But  alas  covered with confusion and dishonour  sinking beneath a consciousness of my guilt  and knowing myself utterly unworthy of her smallest consideration  I wanted courage to address her  and even blushed at my presumption  when I supposed it might be possible for her to remember a miserable wretch like me  with any distant traces of pity or affection—And  O  my mama  did you really  on your reverend knees  condescend to beg   23 a blessing for your unfortunate daughter  did you really  with streaming eyes  implore the Throne of Mercy in my favour  and extend your benignant hands to pluck down comfort on my head  Could you pray for the restoration of her peace who has so barbarously destroyed your happiness  and wish a length of prosperous years to an unnatural monster  whose infamy has shortened your own date of days  and blackened the little remnant with affliction and disgrace —O  madam  where shall I hide myself from this excess of goodness —Where shall I take refuge from this unbounded amplitude of generosity  The severity of reproach I could have borne  because it is deserved  and I could have withstood the shock of indignation  because it is merited  But this astonishing tenderness is insupportable—it overcomes—it destroys me—and at this moment I am forced to   24 make a full pause  being unable to bear up against the conflict of my own heart  which is no less torn with the keenness of my gratitude  than tortured by the pungency of my remorse   A few drops of hartshorn having somewhat relieved a faintingness that came over me just then  I now endeavour to resume my letter  though totally at a loss in what manner to proceed  for  alas  my dear mama  can I possibly mention any subject that will not aggravate the nature of my guilt  and add to the greatness of your affliction  If I ask after my ever honoured father  the pangs with which I have filled his venerable bosom immediately occur—If I mention the best beloved and noblest of brothers  I find him weltering in blood on my account  and if I even address myself to you  who have treated me with such an infinite degree of unexampled   25 generosity
