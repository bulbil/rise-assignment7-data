sudden day that startled us both  when Mr Faulkland reported it to us  I stammered out something  my mother hesitated  Sir George came in  and blundered at us all  so I think we compounded for the time  and amongst us fixed upon this day month—And full soon enough  says my Cecilia  you have known the man but about six weeks  and surely a month is as little time as you can take  in preparing fineries  True  my girl  true  but it is all George’s doings  Indeed  my Cecilia  without affectation  I had much rather have had a longer day  though I think I know the man as well in those six weeks  as if I had been acquainted with him so many years  for he has spent most of his hours with us every day during that time  and my mother says he is one of those in whom there is no guile   Sir George is downright insolent  he declares I am not sensible of my own happiness  and that I deserve to be married to some little petty Wiltshire ’squire  He so piques himself upon making this match  there is no bearing him  He has taken all matters of settlement upon himself  and insists on my mother’s not interposing  She acquiesces  but charges my brother not to let Mr Faulkland’s generosity carry him too far  and bids him remember what is due to his friend  as well as to his sister   July 10  I really begin to be hurried  My mother  you know  is exactly punctilious in every thing  Such a quantity of things are bought  and such a quantity to be bought  that there is no end of journies into the city  Then milaners and mantua makers —One would think I was going to pass the remainder of my life in a remote country  where there were no kind of manufactures or artificers to be come at  and that I was to provide cloathing for half a century   July 12  I have much upon my hands  and Sir George is so impatient  and troublesome  that I believe I must employ an amanuensis  to    give you a minute detail of all our foppery  for I shall not have patience to do it myself   July 17  Sir George has often told me  that he knows of no fault Mr Faulkland has  but a violence of temper when provoked  I saw an instance of it to day  which I was sorry for  and the more so  as I was in some measure accessary to it  Mr Faulkland  my brother  a lady of our acquaintance  and myself  took a ride in Hide Park this morning  We were to dine at Kensington  where my mother was to meet us   at the house of the lady  a relation of Mr Faulkland’s   who was with us   We rode into the stable yard of her house  in order to alight  My horse  which happened to be a young one that Sir George had newly bought  saw some object that made him shy of advancing  and he turned suddenly about  A footman of Mr Faulkland’s  who chanced to stand just behind me  very imprudently  though I am sure with design of harm  gave him a stroke with his whip  which made the animal plunge and throw me  as I had not time to recover my seat from the first short turn he made  I luckily received not the least hurt  and was on my feet in an instant  But Mr Faulkland  who had leaped off his horse even before I fell  was so enraged at the fellow  that he gave him two or three sound lashes with his whip across the shoulders  which fell on him as quick as lightning  I am inclined to think the servant was not sober  for he had the insolence to lay hold of his master’s whip  and muttered an oath or two  Mr Faulkland’s attention being quickly turned to me  he took no farther notice of the man  We went into the house  and after I had assured them all I was not in the least hurt  I begged of Mr Faulkland to forgive the footman  who had undesignedly caused the accident  He made a thousand apologies  for having let his anger so far transport him  as to chastise his servant in a manner he was not used to do  but the peril he put you into  madam  addressing himself to me  made me forget myself  I repeated  I hope  Sir  you have forgiven him  I wish  my dear Miss Bidulph  said he  that the fellow were guilty of no other fault but this  that I might shew you my readiness to obey you  but he is such an intolerable sot  that there is no keeping him with safety  I have forgiven him several idle things  but as I had determined to part with him before this happened  I hope you will be so good as not to insist on my retaining him  I could not intercede for the foolish fellow after this  so said no more   This little incident convinces me that Mr Faulkland is of too warm    a temper  yet I
