cruel than your own father  If he did not consent to the indulgence of your passion  at least he never compelled you to take another wife  My son  replied Don Caesar  I have no wish to exercise a tyranny over your inclinations  which I spurned at in my own case  But have the good manners just to see the lady I design for you  that is all I require from your filial duty  Though a lovely creature and a very advantageous match  I promise never to force you into marriage  She is now in this castle  Follow me  you will be obliged to acknowledge that you have rarely seen a more attractive object  So saying  he led Don Alphonso into a room where I made myself one of the party with Baron Steinbach   There was the Count de Polan with his two daughters  Seraphina and Julia  and Don Ferdinand de Leyva  his son in law  who was Don Caesar s nephew  Don Ferdinand  as was mentioned before  had eloped with Julia  and it was on the occasion of the marriage between these two lovers that the peasantry of the neighbourhood were collected on this day to congratulate the bride and bride groom  As soon as Don Alphonso made his appearance  and his father had introduced him to the company  the Count de Polan rose from his chair and ran to embrace him  saying    Welcome  my deliverer  Don Alphonso  added he  addressing his discourse to him  observe the power of virtue over generous minds  Though you have killed my son  you have saved my life  I lay aside my resentment for ever  and give you that very Seraphina whose honour you protected from invasion  In so doing  my debt to you is paid  Don Caesar s son was not wanting in acknowledgments to the Count de Polan  nor could he be otherwise than deeply affected by his goodness  and it maybe doubted whether the discovery of his birth and parentage touched his felicity more nearly than the intelligence that he was the destined husband of Seraphina  This marriage was actually solemnized some days afterwards  to the entire satisfaction of all parties concerned   As I was one of the Count de Polan s deliverers  this nobleman  who knew me again immediately  said that he would take upon himself the care of making my fortune  I thanked him for his liberality  but would not leave Don Alphonso  who made me steward of his household  and honoured me with his confidence  A few days after his marriage  still harping upon the trick which had been played to Samuel Simon  he sent me to return to that cozened shopkeeper all the money which had been filched from him  I went therefore to make restitution  This was setting up the trade of a steward  but beginning at the wrong end  they ought all of them to end with restitution  but nine hundred and ninety nine out of a thousand think it double trouble  and excuse themselves       BOOK THE SEVENTH       CH  I     The tender attachment between Gil Blas and Dame Lorenza Sephora   AWAY went I to Xelva with three thousand ducats under my charge  as an equivalent to Samuel Simon for the amount of his loss  I will have the honesty to own  that my fingers itched as I jogged along  to transfer these funds to my own account  and begin my stewardship in character  since everything in this life depends upon setting out well  There was no risk in preferring instinct to principle  because it was only to ride about the country for five or six days  and come home upon a brisk trot as if I had done my business and made the best of my way  Don Alphonso and his father would never have believed me capable of a breach of trust  Yet  strange to tell  I was proof against so tempting a suggestion  it would scarcely be too much to say  that honour  not the fear of being found out  was the spring of so praiseworthy a decision  and as times go  that is saying a great deal for a lad  whose conscience had been pretty well seasoned by keeping company with a succession of scoundrels  Many people who have not that excuse  but frequent worshipful society  will wonder how such squeamishness should have prevailed over my good sense  treasurers of charities in particular  persons who have the wills of relations in their custody  and do not exactly like the contents  in short  all those whose characters stand higher than their principles  will find food for reflection in my overstrained scrupulosity   After having made restitution to the merchant  who little thought ever to have seen one farthing of his property again  I returned to the castle of Lena  The Count de Polan had taken his departure  and was far on his journey to Toledo with Julia and Don Ferdinand  I found my new master more wrapped up than ever in Seraphina  his Seraphina equally wrapped up in my master  and Don Caesar just as much wrapped up as either in the contemplation of the happy couple  My object was to gain the goodwill of this affectionate father  and I succeeded to my wish  The whole house was
