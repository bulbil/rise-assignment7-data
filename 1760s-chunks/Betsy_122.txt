to answer this  either through        resentment for the reproaches it contains  or through some remains        of modesty  to attempt an apology for the occasion  but I would not        wish you should give yourself that trouble  for  be assured  I        shall read nothing that comes from you  and that whatever you send        will be returned to you again unopened        She immediately sent this away by a porter  and  having satisfied the   dictates of her indignation against Miss Forward  she had now done with   her  and resolved to think of her no more  yet was the confusion of her   mind far from being dissipated   What will Mr  Trueworth say   cried she   to herself   if ever the ridiculous adventure of last night should reach   his ears  as nothing is more probable than that it may  What will my   brother Frank say  on hearing such a story  What will Mr  Goodman and   Lady Mellasin say  What a triumph for the envious Miss Flora  And what   can I answer for myself  either to my friends or enemies        Little care as this young lady had seemed to have taken of her   reputation  it was  notwithstanding  very dear to her  Honour was yet   still more dear  and she could not reflect  that what she had done might   call the one into question  and how near she had been to having the   other irrecoverably lost  without feeling the most bitter agonies  she   was not able to dress  or go down stairs that day  and gave orders to be   denied to whoever should come to visit her       In this perplexed situation of mind let us leave her for a while  and   see with what sort of temper Mr  Trueworth behaved  after having seen   her go to the very woman he had so much conjured her to avoid       All the love he had for her would not keep him from resenting this last   rebuff  he thought he had not deserved such usage  nor that his having   professed himself her lover  gave her the privilege of treating him as   her slave  The humour he was in making him unfit for company  he went   directly to his lodgings  but had not been long there  before it came   into his head that  possibly  the manner in which she had behaved was   only a fit of contradiction  and that  after all  she might  when she   was out of hearing  have given counter orders to the chairmen  and was   neither gone to Miss Forward s  nor would accompany her to the play    With such vain imaginations does love sometimes flatter its votaries    and the sincere and ardent flame which filled the heart of Mr    Trueworth  made him greedily catch at every supposition in favour of the   darling object       Willing  however  to be more assured  he bethought himself of a   strategem  which would either relieve all the doubts remaining in him of   her obstinacy  or convince him they were but too just  He sent   immediately to his barber for a black perriwig  and  muffled up in a   cloak  so as to render it almost an impossibility for him to be known by   any one  went to the theatre  and  with a heart divided betwixt hope and   fear  placed himself in a part of the middle gallery  which had the full   command of more than half the boxes  He saw a very brilliant circle  but   not she  whom he so much dreaded to find  shine among them       Having scrutinously examined all within the reach of his view  he   quitted his present post  and removed to the other side of the house    where he soon discovered the persons he came in search of  He saw Miss   Forward earnest in discourse with a gentleman that sat behind her  and   Miss Betsy receiving fruit from another  with the same freedom and   gaiety of deportment she could have done if presented by himself  He saw   the nods  the winks  and the grimaces  which several in the pit made to   each other  when looking towards these two ladies  Every moment brought   with it some fresh matter for his mortification  yet would not his   curiosity stop here  When the play was ended  he went hastily down   stairs  and mingled with the crowd that stood about the door  in hopes   of seeing Miss Betsy quit her company  take a chair  and go home  But   how cruel a stab was it to a man who loved
