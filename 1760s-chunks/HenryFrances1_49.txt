 the Mirth or Chearfulness of most Things must flow from the particular Pleasure  we find in the Things themselves  Therefore I shall never again mistake that joyous Spirit  which the Thoughts of you raises in my Heart  for such a Lightness of Mind  as can make me revel in Balls and Masquerades  but rather  what makes me more eminently unfit for such Amusements   I am   my dearest Companion  and most charming Correspondent   Your s in Sense and Truth  Henry   I send you the Ode  you desired  as well as I can recollect it   Voici les Lieux charmants  où mon âme ravi Passoit à contempler Silvié   Ces tranquilles Moments si doûcement perdues   Que je L aimois alors  que je La trouvois belle   Mon Coeur  vous soupirez aù Nom de L Infidelle   Avez vous oublié que vous ne L aimois plus     167Cest ici que souvent parmi ces prairies   Ma Main des fleurs les plus cheris   Lui faisoit des presens  si tendrement receus   Que je L aimois alors  que je La trouvois belle   Mon Coeur  voussoupirez aù Nom de L Infidelle   Avez vous oublié que vous ne L aimois plus     LETTER XCIV  FRANCES to HENRY   YOU will  I dare say  be heartily frighted at the enormous Size of my Packet  But  as it is the Privilege of great Wits to say much in a little  so it is the Custom of small ones to say nothing in a great deal  I have so often illustrated the latter Part of this Trueism  that it is needless to say more on this little Occasion  I must intreat you will be so kind as to forward the Inclosed  as soon as you receive it  —I fear  it has already been too long delayed   I am sincerely glad that you are well  and happy  and shall hereafter say with Caesar   We defy Augury    I have often thought  with you  that the Satisfaction  arising from a particular Object  or   168 Circumstance  is more apt to disqualify us for what the Generality of the World call Pleasure  than even Grief  or Pain  as  in the first Case  the Mind is totally absorbed in one Contemplation  without endeavouring to exert its Faculties on Objects  less pleasing than those  which already employ it —In the Latter  we are attempting to rouse the Mind  and trying to find Ease  or Pleasure  from every new Object  or untried Folly  that surrounds us  Alas  how vain the Effort —  I can  at last  with great Pleasure inform you  that I am writing by my own Fire side  I am certain  we should never enjoy the Pleasures  or Conveniencies of Life  did we not sometimes feel the Want of them  The unsettled  disagreeable Way  I have been in  ever since I came to Town  has endeared Home so much  that  I think  I would rather live in a Cottage  where I was Mistress of myself  than be a Visiter at Versailles   Need I tell my Heart s dear Harry  with what Earnestness  and Sincerity  I wish to see him here  You  and you alone  can double every Charm I find in the rational Enjoyment of myself  and every Thing about me —My Aunt is still in the Country—Kitty remains in Bond Street  The Gaiety of that Place is better suited to her chearful Disposition  than my retired Pleasures  for in those Views  and those  169 only  Pleasure can be called my Associate—I here release the Post master of—  for I would rather my Letters should be read by the whole County  than not be punctually answered by you —  May your Heart beat Time to the gay Life you are engaged in  may the Women talk sensibly  and dress elegantly  and may every one you meet with  be as perfectly agreeable  as you are to your   sincerely affectionate Frances   LETTER XCV  HENRY to FRANCES   I RECEIVED your Packet  and sent it off to my Sister   Your Manner of accounting for the Pleasure  we receive from one Object  rather disqualifying us for other Pleasures  more than even Grief  or Pain  is very just  and very pretty  I found out the Truth  from Experience  But you did more  by investigating the Cause  from Reason  This churlish Pleasure  tho   must be such a one as I receive from you  one  which makes every other appear below my Regard  But why do I call it one Pleasure  when it comprehends the best Part of the highest Pleasures of Sense  Reason  or Reflection  The greatest Happiness in this Life proceeds from Love   170 and Friendship  how much more exquisite the Joy  when both these are centered in the same Object  as one Jewel  tho  but equal in Size to two others  rises infinitely  in Value  above them  Let this be a Lesson to those coy Fair ones  who suffer a Man to break his Heart  before they accept on t  One Heart whole Lover is worth fifty
