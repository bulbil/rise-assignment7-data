the days of courtship are the happiest days of life  But the man  who  as a Lover  thinks so  is not to be forgiven  Yet it must be confessed  that hope gives an ardour which subsides in certainty   Being called upon by Lord L  to be more explicit   I am not endeavouring  said he  to set up my particular humour for a general rule  For my own sake  I would not  by a too early declaration  drive a Lady into reserves  since that would be to rob myself of those innocent freedoms  and of that complacency  to which an honourable Lover might think himself entitled  and which might help him  Don t be affrighted  Ladies   to develop the plaits and folds of the female heart     305 This developement stuck with us women a little  We talked of it afterwards  And Miss Grandison then said  It was well her cousin Everard said not that  And he answered  Sir Charles may with more safety steal an horse  than I look over the hedge   Miss Gr  Ay  cousin Grandison  that is because you are a Rake  A name  believe me  of at least as much reproach  as that of an Old Maid   Mr  Gr  Aspersing a whole class at once  Miss Charlotte   Tis contrary to your own maxim  And a class too  this of the Rakes  that many a generousspirited girl chooses out of  when she would dispose of herself and her fortune   Miss Gr  How malapert this Everard   What Sir Charles next said  made him own the character more decently by his blushes   The woman who chooses a Rake  said he  does not consider  that all the sprightly airs for which she preferred him to a better man  either vanish in matrimony  or are shewn to others  to her mortal disquiet  The agreeable will be carried abroad  The disagreeable will be brought home  If he reform  and yet bad habits are very difficult to shake off  he will probably  from the reflexions on his past guilty life  be an unsociable companion  should deep and true contrition have laid hold on him  If not  what has she chosen  He married not from honest principles  A Rake despises matrimony  If still a Rake  what hold will she have of him  A Rake in Passion is not a Rake in Love  Such a one can seldom be in Love  From a laudable passion he cannot  He has no delicacy  His Love deserves a vile name  And if so  it will be strange  if in his eyes a common woman excel not his modest wife   What he said  was openly approved by the Gentlemen  tacitly by the Ladies   The subject changing to marriages of persons of unequal years  I knew  said Lord L  a woman of character    306 and not reckoned to 〈…〉  who married at twenty a man of more than fif•y in hopes of burying him  but who lived with her •eward of twenty years  and then dying  she is now in treaty with a young Rake of twenty two  She is rich  and  poor woman  hopes to be happy  Pity  Sir Charles  she could not see the picture you have been dra••ng   Retribution  said Sir Charles  will frequently take its course  The Lady  keeping in view one steady purpose  which was  That she would marry a young man  whenever death removed the old one  forgot  when she lost her husband  that she had been growing older for the last twenty years  and will now very probably be the despised mate to the young husband  that her late husband was to her  Thirty years hence  the now young man will perhaps fall into the error of his predecessor  if he outlive the wife he is going to take  and be punished in the same way  These are what may be called punishments in kind  The violators of the social duties are frequently punished by the success of their own wishes  Don t you think  my Lord  that it is suitable to the divine benignity  as well as justice  to lend its sanctions and punishments in aid of those duties which bind man to man   Lord L  said some very good things  Your Harriet was not a mute  But you know  that my point is  to let you into the character and sentiments of Sir Charles Grandison  And whenever I can do them tolerable justice  I shall keep to that point  You will promise for me  you say  Lucy—I know you will   But one might have expected that Dr  Bartlett would have said more than he did  on some of the subjects  Yet Mr  Grandison  and he  and Miss Emily  were almost equally  and attentively  silent  till the last scene  And then the Doctor said  I must shew you a little translation of Miss Emily s from the Italian  She blushed  and looked as if she knew not whether she should stay or go  I shall be glad to see   307 any thing of my Emily s
