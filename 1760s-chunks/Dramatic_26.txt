 WINIFRED SWINGLE   Now  David  I will have you be easy  hear reason  and not fly into any more passions  nor don t swear against your wife  for  to be sure  a finer woman —    DAVID   Never was a finer woman  to be sure —So is my loss the more  I shall love her to my dying day  but she has robbed me  and run away herself into the bargain  and where is her honour now     WINIFRED   Don t you talk so much about honour now  I desire  and require of you  for if you would be a good christian  you must forget  and forgive  for what  pray  doth the Scripture say about honour —not much  and pray what do the people of honour say about the Scripture  why not much  So you need not so much mind honour  if you will but be a good christian     DAVID   But then the Devil shall be a good christian for me — God forgive us—but how can I  ap  Page  78  Shingle  how can I bear to lye by her side now  pray  will there be any christanity in that     WINIFRED   Silence  I tell you  David  You shall hear what I will read to you  it is our teacher s sermon  which he did say at the Tabernacle last Sunday  about forgiveness  and christianity  and women  and our backslidings  so pray  David  mind     Reads  Putting on her spectacles   The JUSTIFYING EJACULATION     I say unto you  my beloved  that when the spirit agitateth the flesh  it is a spiritual act  but when the flesh motioneth the spirit  it is a carnal one  And this is the difference  between GRACE and DISGRACE     For worldly things  unless sanctification seeths them  are no more than kitchen stuff  which the scum of our sins maketh  in boiling over  and that is put into the offal pot of repentance     Therefore  the saints of the Tabernacle  being clarified by the justification of the new birth  are pure Christian suet  which  when mixed with the plumbs of the righteous  make up the pudding of glorification     Winifred  Speaks   O sweet Abraham  what heavenly language is this  don t go to sleep  David  I desire of  Page  79  you  how can you be worse than a heathen  and not listen to this sweet soul saving speech     Reads again   The pudding of glorification—therefore I say  that we may mingle the spirit with the flesh  even as potatoes and butter milk make stirrabout  for that is the type of the carnalities  and spiritualities     So I say     wiping her spectacles    it is not sinful to consider the uprightness of the flesh  as directed by the spirit  because we may receive the spirit at home  or in the fields  or in an alley  or in a centry box  and I ll stand centry among you  and if you have faith  you shall raise the dead to life  I won t be a velvet mouth d preacher  like your church doctors  and book learned blockheads  —no—no—no—oh—oh —can a boy fly a kite without thinking of the clouds  can a woman spread her fan  without thinking of an angel s wings  Therefore  I say  that the natural man is not the spiritual man  Yet the spiritual man may think of natural things  So those things are to be put forward  which are to satisfy the longings of the soul  and tho  at first it may be painful to undergo them   At that instant  the tankard from the hand of Mr  David  fell to the ground  the good man  overcome with the two quarts of porter  the keeping all night awake  reflecting upon his honour  and the potency of the preacher s arguments  dropped fast asleep  Which  when Mrs  Winifred observed  she sighed  and said he was a lost soul  waked him  and after some time spent between them  in settling the terms   Page  80  she went home with David  to be his housekeeper     SCENE PLYMOUTH   Madam Llwhyddwhuydd  Corporal Knott  Mountebank Doctor  Duel  Merry Andrew  Cheating at Cards  and News papers   THE Corporal  by this time  and his lady  began to view one another in not that rapturous point of sight  as at first  All the plate  and ready money  which she had taken with her  was expended  for Mr  Knott  had too much of the fine gentleman in him  not to be fond of play  and too good an opinion of himself  to fancy any person could take him in  but after the money was all gone  his eyes were opened  and he determined to commence gambler himself     At his quarters lodged a Mountebank and his man  The Merry Andrew was a master
