thing that pleased her  and to contrive all the methods he could    without her perceiving he did so  of stealing  by gentle degrees  into   her mind  a disrelish of such things as were unbecoming in her       He had but just rose from a bed which that night had afforded him but   little repose  when he was told Sir Bazil Loveit  to whom he had given   his directions the day before  was come to wait upon him  Mr  Trueworth   was very glad of it  being impatient to undeceive him in the opinion he   found he had entertained of Miss Betsy  They had not been three minutes   together before the other gave him an opportunity  by some facetious   interrogatories concerning the transactions of the past night  and    among the rest  after looking round the room  asked how he had disposed   of his pretty Betsy  To all which Mr  Trueworth replied  with a very   serious air   Sir Bazil  though I must own there are many appearances to   justify your mistake  yet I hope my word and honour will out balance   them  I do assure you  Sir  that lady  whom you think and speak so   lightly of  is a woman of fortune  family  and reputation     I am   sorry  then   said Sir Bazil  very much surprized   I treated her in the   manner I did  My Nancy  indeed   continued he  meaning Miss Forward     told me she was virtuous  but I did not regard what she said on that   score  I know it is a trick among them to set off one another  to draw   in us men  But  pr ythee  dear Charles  are you in earnest   Mr    Trueworth  then  after having made a second asseveration that he was   sincere in what he said  proceeded to give him some account of Miss   Betsy s family  circumstances  and manner of life  adding  that nothing   could be more surprizing to him  than to have met her in that place     But   said he   she must certainly be unacquainted with the character   of the woman she came to visit         Such a thing might possibly happen   replied Sir Bazil   and I think   you would do well to give her a hint of it     Doubtless   cried the   other   I am doubly bound to do so  first  by my own honour  and  next    by the friendship I have for some of her kindred   No farther discourse   passed between them on this score  and the remaining time they were   together being taken up on matters altogether foreign to the business of   this history  there is no occasion for making any mention of it       Sir Bazil staid so long  that when he had taken his leave  it was too   late for Mr  Trueworth to make a morning visit to Miss Betsy  as he   intended to have done  so was obliged to defer it till the afternoon    though  since his first acquaintance with her  he had never felt more   impatience to see her       As he had much in his head to say to her on the subject of the preceding   day  he went as soon as he thought dinner was entirely over at Mr    Goodman s  in order to have an opportunity of talking with her before   any other company came in  She was then in her chamber  dressing  but he   waited not long before she came down  and appeared more lovely and   dazzling in his eyes than ever  This happened to be the first day of her   putting on a very rich and extremely well fancied gown  and  either   because it was more becoming than any of those he had seen her in   before  or because of the pleasure ladies of her age and humour   generally feel on such occasions  a more than usual brightness shone in   her eyes  and was diffused through all her air  and  after having made   her some compliments on the elegance of her taste in dress   I suppose    Madam   said he   thus set forth  and equipped for conquest  you do not   mean to stay at home this evening     No  indeed   replied she   I am   told there is a new tragedy to be acted to night at Lincoln s Inn   Fields  and I would not for the world miss the first night of a new   play        On this  Mr  Trueworth asked if he might have leave to wait upon her   there   With all my heart
