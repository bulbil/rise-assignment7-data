disturbed by the report of a gun just by us  and immediately after a man was seen bursting through the hedge  to take up the game he had killed  This sportsman was the  Squire s chaplain  who had shot one of the blackbirds that so agreeably entertained us  So loud a report  and so near  startled my daughters  and I could perceive that Sophia in the fright had thrown herself into Mr  Burchell s arms for protection  The gentleman came up  and asked pardon for having disturbed us  affirming that he was ignorant of our being so near  He therefore sate down by my youngest daughter  and  sportsman like  offered her what he had killed that morning  She was going to refuse  but a private look from her mother soon induced her to correct the mistake  and accept his present  though with some reluctance  My wife  as usual  discovered her pride in a whisper  observing  that Sophy had  Page  79  made a conquest of the chaplain  as well as her sister had of the  Squire  I suspected  however  with more probability  that her affections were placed upon a different object  The chaplain s errand was to inform us  that Mr  Thornhill had provided music and refreshments  and intended that night giving the young ladies a ball by moonlight  on the grass plot before our door    Nor can I deny    continued he    but I have an interest in being first to deliver this message  as I expect for my reward to be honoured with miss Sophy s hand as a partner    To this my girl replied  that she should have no objection  if she could do it with honour    But here    continued she    is a gentleman    looking at Mr  Burchell    who has been my companion in the task for the day  and it is fit he should share in its amusements    Mr  Burchell returned her a compliment for her intentions  but resigned her up to the chaplain  adding that he was to go that night five miles  being invited  Page  80  to an harvest supper  His refusal appeared to me a little extraordinary  nor could I conceive how so sensible a girl as my youngest  could thus prefer a middle aged man of broken fortune to a sprightly young fellow of twenty two  But as men are most capable of distinguishing merit in women  so the ladies often form the truest judgments upon us  The two sexes seem placed as spies upon each other  and are furnished with different abilities  adapted for mutual inspection     Page   unnumbered   CHAP  IX   Two ladies of great distinction introduced  Superior finery ever seems to confer superior breeding   MR  Burchell had scarce taken leave  and Sophia consented to dance with the chaplain  when my little ones came running out to tell us that the  Squire was come  with a crowd of company  Upon our return  we found our landlord  with a couple of under gentlemen and two young ladies richly drest  whom he introduced as women of very great distinction and fashion from town  We happened not to have chairs enough for the whole company  but Mr  Thornhill immediately proposed that every gentleman should sit in a lady s lap   Page  82  This I positively objected to  notwithstanding a look of disapprobation from my wife  Moses was therefore dispatched to borrow a couple of chairs  and as we were in want of ladies also to make up a set at country dances  the two gentlemen went with him in quest of a couple of partners  Chairs and partners were soon provided  The gentlemen returned with my neighbour Flamborough s rosy daughters  flaunting with red top knots  But there was an unlucky circumstance which was not adverted to  though the Miss Flamboroughs were reckoned the very best dancers in the parish  and understood the jig and the round about to perfection  yet they were totally unacquainted with country dances  This at first discomposed us  however  after a little shoving and dragging  they began to go merrily on  Our music consisted of two fiddles  with a pipe and tabor  The moon shone bright  Mr  Thornhill and my eldest daughter led up the ball  to the great delight of the  Page  83  spectators  for the neighbours hearing what was going forward  came flocking about us  My girl moved with so much grace and vivacity  that my wife could not avoid discovering the pride of her heart  by assuring me  that though the little chit did it so cleverly  all the steps were stolen from herself  The ladies of the town strove hard to be equally easy  but without success  They swam  sprawled  languished  and frisked  but all would not do  the gazers indeed owned that it was fine  but neighbour Flamborough observed  that Miss Livy s feet seemed as pat to the music as its echo  After the dance had continued about an hour  the two ladies  who were apprehensive of catching cold  moved to break up the ball  One of them  I thought  expressed her sentiments
