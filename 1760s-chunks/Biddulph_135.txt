possess infinite blessings  My husband  my dear Mr Arnold  my two sweet children  the best of mothers  and thee  my ever beloved Cecilia  whom I still call mine  though at such a distance from me   Then I comfort myself with reflecting that lady V—— has sons  who  I hope  will be a blessing to her  that her fortune is affluent  and that my lord had passed through a well spent life  to a pretty advanced age  He was turned of sixty  All these considerations sooth my mind  and I acknowlege  that  upon the whole  I have  by far  more cause to be thankful  than to repine   March 30  Lady V——’s journey down to V—— hall having been so fatally prevented  she is obliged to remain in London  The shock she has received has brought on her a fit of illness  I find my lord has not left any ready money  his fortune was large  but as they always lived in great splendor  he laid none of his income by  the whole sum which he could command  he laid out for our use  My lady’s jointure is pretty considerable  if it were ten times more  she deserves it  Oh  may her sons prove worthy of such a parent  The youngest I hear is a very fine youth  He is come to her from Oxford to comfort her  till the arrival of his elder brother   My mother writes me word  that her old friend lady Grimston is dead  She has left her whole fortune to charitable uses  not a sixpence to either of her daughters  Poor Mrs Vere  She is content with her little income  and has no loss of so unnatural a parent  who carried her vindictive spirit with her to the grave  As for the eldest  she did not stand in need of any assistance from her  but I own  though I had not great esteem for lady Grimston  I could not help    being shocked at the brutal behaviour of her son in law to her in her last hours  She had never seen either him or her daughter from the time I told you they had quarrelled  but when she found herself dying  she sent a message to this favourite daughter  desiring to see her  her husband  whether out of disregard to the old lady  or his wife  or both  absolutely refused to let her go  My mother remarks on this passage in these words  ‘Thus was this unfortunate parent punished in kind  for denying her late husband the satisfaction of seeing his youngest daughter  when he was in the same circumstances with herself ’  My mother is nevertheless very much troubled for the death of her old acquaintance  who  she says  was a valuable woman  she considers her decease as a memento  which warns her of her own approaching end  for they were just of an age   I fear my mother is not well  though she does not say so  for she has put off her coming to Sidney castle  without giving me a reason for it   April 22  I thank you  my beloved Cecilia  for your cordial wish  Your opinion  that all my troubles are at an end  is consonant to your desires  but I doubt far from the real fact  The young lord V—— is returned home  but oh  how unlike that honest man  whose title and fortune he inherits  How deceived were his worthy parents in their hopes of him  he is a stranger to every sentiment of virtue  I have had a letter this day from my lady V——  wherein she laments the degeneracy of her son  whom they were made to believe a pattern of excellence  but the tutor to whom they entrusted him was as profligate as himself  In short  she says he is quite a reprobate  she has not the least authority or influence over him  she laments this  particularly on our account  we are indebted to him near five thousand pounds  and my lady says  she fears he will press Mr Arnold  He is profuse  she says  in his expences  without being generous   What can we do my dear  There is not the least prospect now of our being able to pay this money  but by selling the only remaining stake we have left  Had my lord lived  he made us hope that by his interest he could procure Mr Arnold some employment which would have enabled him to discharge this debt at his ease  without our being obliged to strip ourselves of our all  As we purposed living with the utmost oeconomy  this might have been accomplished in a few years     This prospect is now lost to us  We must submit  I have begged of Mr Arnold to think immediately of selling my jointure  for we have no reason to expect any lenity from a man of such a character as the present lord V—— is  We can subsist upon the income  which my mother is so good as to allow us  it is precarious it is true  but something may happen  I rely on that providence  who has hitherto protected me   April 28  Lady V——’s apprehensions
