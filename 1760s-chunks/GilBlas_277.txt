of Calatrava  and is a very accomplished person  His name is Don Gaston de Cogollos  You may meet as often as you like  and take your meals together  It will afford reciprocal consolation to compare your fortunes  There can be no doubt of your being agreeable to one another  I assured Don Andrew how sensible I was of his indulgence in allowing me to blend my sorrows with those of my fellow sufferer  and  as I betrayed some impatience to be acquainted with him  our accommodating warden met my wishes on the very same day  He fixed me to dine with Don Gaston  whose prepossessing physiognomy and symmetry of feature struck me sensibly  Judge what it must have been  to make so strong an impression on eyes accustomed to encounter the dazzling exterior of the court  Figure to yourself a man fashioned in the mould of pleasure  one of those heroes in romance  who has only to shew his face  and banish the sweet sleep from the eyelids of princesses  Add to this  that nature  who is generally bountiful with one hand and niggardly with the other  had crowned the perfections of Cogollos with wit and valour  He was a man  whose like  take him for all in all  we might not soon look upon again   If this fine fellow was mightily to my taste  it was my good luck not to be altogether offensive to him  He no longer sang at night for fear of annoying me  though I begged him by no means to restrain his inclinations on my account  A bond of union is soon formed between brethren in misfortune  A close friendship succeeded to mere acquaintance  and strengthened from day to day  The liberty of uninterrupted intercourse contributed greatly to our mutual support  our burden became lighter by division   One day after dinner I went into his room  just as he was tuning his guitar  To hear him more at my ease  I sat down on the only stool  while he  reclining on his bed  played a pathetic air  and sang to it a ditty  expressing the despair of a lover and the cruelty of his mistress  When he had finished  I said to him with a smile  Sir knight  such strains as these could never be applicable to your own successes with the fair  You were not made to cope with female repulse  You think too well of me  answered he  The verses you have just heard were composed to fit my own case  to soften a heart of adamant  You must hear my story  and in my story  my distresses       CH  VI    History of Don Gaston de Cogollos and Donna Helena de Galisteo   IT will be very soon four years since I left Madrid to go and see my aunt Donna Eleonora de Laxarilla at Coria  she is one of the richest dowagers in Old Castile  with myself for her only heir  Scarcely had I got within her doors  when love invaded my repose  The windows of my room faced the lattice of a lady living opposite  but the street was narrow  and her blinds pervious to the eye  It was an opportunity too delicious to be lost  and I found my neighbour so lovely that my heart was captivated  The subject of my sentry watch could not be mistaken  She marked it well  but she was not a girl to glory in the detection  still less to encourage my fooleries   It was natural to inquire the name of this mighty conqueror  I learnt it to be Donna Helena  only daughter of Don George de Galisteo  lord of a large domain near Coria  She had innumerable offers of marriage  but her father repulsed them all  because he meant to bestow her hand on his nephew  Don Austin de Olighera  who had uninterrupted access to his cousin while the settlements were preparing  This was no bar to my hopes  on the contrary  it whetted my eagerness  and the insolent pleasure of supplanting a favoured rival was  perhaps  at bottom equally my motive with a more noble passion  My visual artillery was obstinately planted against my unyielding fair  Her attendant Felicia was not without the incense of a glance  to soften her rigid constancy in my favour  while nods and becks stood for the current coin of language  But all these efforts of gallantry were in vain    the maid was impregnable like her mistress    never was there such a pair of cold and cruel ones   The commerce of the eyes being so unthrifty  I had recourse to different agents  My scouts were on the watch to hunt out what acquaintance Felicia might have in town  They discovered an old lady  by name Theodora  to be her most intimate friend  and that they often met  Delighted at the intelligence  I went point blank to Theodora  and engaged her by presents in my interest  She took my cause up heartily  promised to contrive an interview for me with her friend  and kept her engagement the very next day   I am no longer the wretch of yesterday  said I to Felicia  since my sufferings have melted you to pity  How deep is my debt to your friend for her kind
