to conceal it  or to lay it before my relations  My friend  Mrs  Dobson  and her sister  with their good natured niece and daughter  visit me at every convenient opportunity  and I have now made the worthy people acquainted with the history of my misfortunes  though I have not yet informed them either of my betrayer s name  or the name of my own family  and  what is still more  I have perswaded Sally s mother to accept of fifty guineas  which I had in my purse  for all her trouble and expence  and Mrs  Dobson has promised to wear a ring for my sake  but not  till she sees me out of this house —Somehow  worthy as these people are  they look upon public penance as disreputable—perhaps  according to the modes of this country  it may be so  but what  in   176 fact  is custom  where conscience is solely to determine upon virtues and upon crimes —It is true  if my imagination had not been disturbed  I had never dreamt of entering into a place  particularly dedicated to the public penitence of prostitution —Yet  alas  Harriot  how am I better than the unhappy poor creatures  whom the pinching hand of necessity  or the poignant stings of remorse  have brought to the same salutary  yet humiliating habitation —Have I not violated the sacred laws of virtue —Have I not blasted my reputation —Have I not torn a father s heart with unutterable anguish —Have I not steeped the pillow of an excellent mother in despair —And may not the generous youth  my brother  be long since murdered on my account —O save me  Harriot  from that dreadful supposition—Snatch me  if possible  from my fears upon this occasion—or   177 my portion must be distraction without end —Gracious God  what a wretch do I appear  on the smallest recollection —And shall such a creature as I  imagine she is any ways lessened  by mingling with those who  like herself  have sacrificed the dignity of their sex  and the honour of their families —No  Harriot  this is the properest habitation for me now—Here meditation  as the poet says  may find room even to madness—And here the streaming eye of a heart directed contrition  may possibly wash away the stains of guilt  and induce the awful Father of Mercies to overlook my crimes —But my poor parents—my noble minded brother—O Harriot  if I yet retain any share in your remembrance  write to me instantly—I shall not close my eyes  till the return of the post —A letter directed to Mrs  Carter s  my kind hostess  in Whitechapel  for Charlotte Windham   the name which   178 I assumed in the unsettled state of my mind  to prevent my family from receiving any farther disgrace  will be immediately forwarded to the lost unhappy wretch  who possessed the first place in your friendship  when she was  LOUISA MILDMAY     179  LETTER XX  Sir ROBERT HAROLD  to CHARLES MELMOTH  Esq    Calais  December 16   OH Melmoth  my Louisa is innocent—her account is authenticated by the strongest of all testimonies—the acknowledgment of Hastings himself  and the villain has  by this time  probably  attoned with his life for all the tortures of her bosom  and all the agonies of mine —I have just reached this place  and have sat down  while a little vessel is getting ready to sail with me for Dover  to send you a cursory account of particulars  lest any accident should prevent me from being with you in London as early as the post     180I had just received lady Haversham s copy of Louisa s affecting history  which you sent me with your last  when  all life and spirits  I dressed for the opera  and happened to be introduced into a box  where an English gentleman was sitting alone  with whom I fell into so familiar a conversation  that I accepted a proposal which he made  of eating a bit of supper at a tavern  after the performance  and this the more readily  as his appearance bore an indication of fashion  and as  in the course of our chat  he mentioned his being intimate with two or three gentlemen of my acquaintance   When the opera was over  we retired to one of the best houses in the neighbourhood of the theatre  where  after drinking two or three glasses of Burgundy  he mentioned that his name was Sir Harry Hastings  and that he had a seat in the county of Oxford —I need   181 not tell you  that this information set me instantly on fire  I was just going to break out  and to demand satisfaction for his outrages to Louisa  when  recollecting it would be best to hear his own account of matters—for fear  after all  that Miss Mildmay might draw up a story to answer her own purposes  and trespass a little upon veracity  to extenuate the infamy of her flight  With this view  I asked Sir Harry  if he was acquainted with the Mildmays  as I knew something of a gentleman  who had paid his addresses to a young lady of that family —   Acquainted with them   replied Sir Harry   yes  I am perfectly
