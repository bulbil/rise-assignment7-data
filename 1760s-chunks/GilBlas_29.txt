the carriage and the uncased carcases by the road side  we carried off with us the lady  the mules  and the horses       CH  X     The lady s treatment from the robbers  The event of the great design  conceived by Gil Blas   THE night had another hour to run when we arrived at our subterraneous mansion  The first thing we did was to lead our cavalry to the stable  where we were obliged to groom them ourselves  as the old negro had been confined to his bed for three days  with a violent fit of the gout  and an universal rheumatism  He had no member supple but his tongue  and that he employed in testifying his indignation by the most horrible impieties  Leaving this wretch to curse and swear by himself  we went to the kitchen to look after the lady  So successful were our attentions  that we succeeded in recovering her from her fit  But when she had once more the use of her senses  and saw herself encompassed by strangers  she knew the extent of her misfortune  and shuddered at the thought  All that grief and despair together could present  of images the most distressing  appeared depicted in her eyes  which she lifted up to heaven  as if in reproach for the indignities she was threatened with  Then  giving way at once to these dreadful apprehensions  she fell again into a swoon  her eyelids closed once more  and the robbers thought that death was going to snatch from them their prey  The captain  therefore  judging it more to the purpose to leave her to herself than to torment her with any more of their assistance  ordered her to be laid on Leonarda s bed  and at all events to let nature take its course   We went into the hall  where one of the robbers  who had been bred a surgeon  looked at the lieutenant s arm and put a plaister to it  After this scientific operation  it was thought expedient to examine the baggage  Some of the trunks were filled with laces and linen  others with various articles of wearing apparel  but the last contained some bags of coin  a circumstance highly approved by the receivers general of the estate  After this investigation  the cook set out the side board  laid the cloth  and served up supper  Our conversation ran first on the great victory we had achieved  On this subject said Rolando  directing himself to me  Confess the truth  Gil Blas  you cannot deny that you were devilishly frightened  I candidly admitted the fact  but promised to fight like a crusader after my second or third campaign  Hereupon all the company took my part  alleging the sharpness of the action in my excuse  and that it was very well for a novice  not yet accustomed to the smell of powder   We next talked of the mules and horses just added to our subterraneous stud  It was determined to set off the next morning before day break  and sell them at Mansilla  before there was any chance of our expedition having got wind  This resolution taken  we finished our supper  and returned to the kitchen to pay our respects to the lady  We found her in the same condition  Nevertheless  though the dregs of life seemed almost exhausted  some of these poachers could not help casting a wicked leer at her  and giving visible signs of a motion within them  which would have broken out into overt act  had not Rolando put a spoke in their wheel by representing that they ought at least to wait till the lady had got rid of her terrors and squeamishness  and could come in for her share of the amusement  Their respect for the captain operated as a check to the incontinence of their passions  Nothing else could have saved the lady  nor would death itself probably have secured her from violation   Again therefore did we leave this unhappy female to her melancholy fate  Rolando contented himself with charging Leonarda to take care of her  and we all separated for the night  For my part  when I went to bed  instead of courting sleep  my thoughts were wholly taken up with the lady s misfortunes  I had no doubt of her being a woman of quality  and thought her lot on that account so much the more piteous  I could not paint to myself  without shuddering  the horrors which awaited her  and felt myself as sensibly affected by them  as if united to her by the ties of blood or friendship  At length  after having sufficiently bewailed her destiny  I mused on the means of preserving her honour from its present danger  and myself from a longer abode in this dungeon  I considered that the old negro could not stir  and recollected that since his illness the cook had the key of the grate  That thought warmed my fancy  and gave birth to a project not to be hazarded lightly  the stages of its execution were the following   I pretended to have the colic  A lad in the colic cannot help whining and groaning  but I went further  and cried out lustily  as loud as my lungs would let me  This roused my gentle friends  and
