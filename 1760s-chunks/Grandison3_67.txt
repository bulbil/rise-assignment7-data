his  I don t know whether he would wish for Charlotte  Excuse me  madam  you have heard  as well as she  my opinion of both men  Sir Walter  you say  has no part in the question  Lord G  wants not understanding  He is a man of probity  he is a virtuous man  a quality not to be despised in a young nobleman  He is also a mild man  He will bear a great deal  But contempt  or such a behaviour as should look like contempt  in a wife  what husband can bear  I should much more dread  for her sake  the exasperated spirit of a meek man  than the sudden gusts of anger of a passionate one   Miss Grandison  Sir  has authorized me to say  That if you approve of Lord G  s addresses  and will be so good as to take upon yourself the direction of every thing relating to settlements  she will be entirely govern d by you  Miss Grandison  Sir  has known Lord G  some time  His good character is well known  And I dare answer  that she will acquit herself with honour and prudence  in every engagement  but more especially in that which is the highest of all worldly ones   Pray  madam  may I ask  If you know what she could mean by the questions she put in relation to Mr  Beauchamp  I think she has never seen him  Does she suppose  from his character  that she could prefer him to Lord G    I believe  Sir  what she said in relation to that gentleman  was purely the effect of her vivacity  and which she never thought of before  and probably    165 never will again  Had she meant any thing by it  I dare say  she would not have put the questions about him in the manner she did   I believe so  I love my sister  and I love my friend  Mr  Beauchamp has delicacy  I could not bear  for her sake  that  were she to behold him in the light hinted at  he should imagine he had reason to think slightly of my sister  for the correspondence she carried on  in so private a manner  with a man absolutely unworthy of her  But I hope she meant nothing  but to give way to that vein of raillery  which  when opened  she knows not always how to stop   My spirits were not high  I was forced to take out my handkerchief—O my dear Miss Grandison  said I  I was afraid she had forfeited  partly  at least  what she holds most dear  the good opinion of her brother   Forgive me  madam   tis a generous pain that I have made you suffer  I adore you for it  But I think I can reveal all the secrets of my heart to you  Your noble frankness calls for equal frankness  You would inspire it  where it is not  My sister  as I told her more than once in your hearing  has not lost any of my love  I love her  with all her faults  but must not be blind to them  Shall not praise and dispraise be justly given  I have faults  great faults  myself  What should I think of the man who called them virtues  How dangerous would it be to me  in that case  were my opinion of his judgment  joined to selfpartiality  to lead me to believe him  and acquit my self   This  Sir  is a manner of thinking worthy of Sir Charles Grandison   It is worthy of every man  my good Miss Byron   But  Sir  it would be very hard  that an indiscretion  I must own it to be such  should fasten reproach upon a woman who recovered herself so soon  and whose virtue was never sullied  or in danger   Indeed it would  And therefore it was in tenderness   166 to her that I intimated  that I never could think of promoting an alliance with a man of his nice notions  were both to incline to it   I hope  Sir  that my dear Miss Grandison will run no risque of being slighted  by any other man▪ from a step which has cost her so dear in her peace of mind—I hesitated  and looked down   I know  madam  what you mean  Altho  I love my friend Beauchamp above all men  yet would I do Lord G  or any other man  as much justice  as I would do him  I was so apprehensive of my sister s indifference to Lord G  and of the difference in their tempers  tho  both good  that I did my utmost to dissuade him from thinking of her  And when I found that his love was fixed beyond the power of dissuasion  I told him of the affair between her and Captain Anderson  and how lately I had put an end to it  He flattered himself  that the indifference  with which she had hitherto received his addresses  was principally owing to the difficulty of her situation  which being now so happily removed  he
