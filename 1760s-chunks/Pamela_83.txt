follows           I am sorry to tell you that I have had a repulse from Lady Jones  She   is concerned at your case  she says  but don t care to make herself   enemies  I applied to Lady Darnford  and told her in the most pathetic   manner I could  your sad story  and shewed her your more pathetic   letter  I found her well disposed  but she would advise with Sir Simon    who by the by is not a man of an extraordinary character for virtue  but   he said to his lady in my presence   Why  what is all this  my dear  but   that our neighbour has a mind to his mother s waiting maid  And if he   takes care she wants for nothing  I don t see any great injury will be   done her  He hurts no family by this    So  my dear father and mother    it seems that poor people s honesty is to go for nothing   And I think    Mr  Williams  you  of all men  should not engage in this affair  against   your friend and patron   He spoke this in so determined a manner  that   the lady had done  and I had only to beg no notice should be taken of   the matter as from me        I have hinted your case to Mr  Peters  the minister of this parish    but I am concerned to say  that he imputed selfish views to me  as if   I would make an interest in your affections by my zeal  And when I   represented the duties of our function  and the like  and protested my   disinterestedness  he coldly said  I was very good  but was a young man    and knew little of the world  And though it was a thing to be lamented    yet when he and I should set about to reform mankind in this respect  we   should have enough upon our hands  for  he said  it was too common and   fashionable a case to be withstood by a private clergyman or two  and   then he uttered some reflections upon the conduct of the present fathers   of the church  in regard to the first personages of the realm  as a   justification of his coldness on this score        I represented the different circumstances of your affair  that other   women lived evilly by their own consent  but to serve you  was to save   an innocence that had but few examples  and then I shewed him your   letter        He said it was prettily written  and he was sorry for you  and that   your good intentions ought to be encouraged  But what  said he  would   you have me do  Mr  Williams  Why suppose  sir  said I  you give her   shelter in your house  with your spouse and niece  till she can get to   her friends   What  and embroil myself with a man of Mr  B     s power   and fortune  No  not I  I ll assure you   And I would have you consider   what you are about  Besides  she owns  continued he  that he promises   to do honourably by her  and her shyness will procure her good terns   enough  for he is no covetous nor wicked gentleman  except in this case    and  tis what all young gentlemen will do        I am greatly concerned for him  I assure you  but I am not discouraged   by this ill success  let what will come of it  if I can serve you        I don t hear  as yet  that Mr  B     is coming  I am glad of your hint   as to that unhappy fellow John Arnold  Something  perhaps  will strike   out from that  which may be useful  As to your packets  if you seal them   up  and lay them in the usual place  if you find it not suspected  I   will watch an opportunity to convey them  but if they are large  you had   best be very cautious  This evil woman  I find  mistrusts me much        I just hear  that the gentleman is dying  whose living Mr  B     has   promised me  I have almost a scruple to take it  as I am acting so   contrary to his desires  but I hope he will one day thank me for it  As   to money  don t think of it at present  Be assured you may command all   in my power to do for you without reserve        I
