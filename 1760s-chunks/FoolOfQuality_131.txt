the mercy of the   elements  O  how deeply degraded below the birds of the air  the   beasts of the forest  or even the worms of the sod  who rightfully   claim sustenance from the earth whereof they were bred  and have   some hole apart whereto they may creep for shelter       The world  indeed  lay before us  It was wide and all sufficient     and yet nothing to our purpose  We had neither art nor part    concern or interest  therein  It was to us as a harbour to tempest    beaten mariners  who are shut out and driven thence on suspicion   of the plague      All hopeless  weak  and faint  we took our way  we knew not   whither   without home whereto we might travel  or point whereto   we might steer  We could think of no one living who would   receive or acknowledge us   and we seemed to have no way save that   of hastening as fast as we could from the presence of mankind      Slow and tottering as we went  my wife and I carried our little   Tommy by turns   and in the smoother places he walked with the   help of our hands  Thus  with much toil and fatigue  we got out   of London  and reposed ourselves on a bank that lay a little off the   causeway  Here we found ourselves greatly distressed with thirst     and  getting up again  we made towards a small hut that stood   beside the road  where they had the charity to treat us with a   draught of cold water  With this we were wonderfully refreshed   and recruited   and  putting on again Hammy  says my Arabella    no conqueror on his triumphal entry into Eome ever exulted as I   do in your fortitude this day  And what signifies it now that it   comes to the test  It is but to travel  my love  till we can travel   no further   and then we drop  fit and ready  and ripe for eternity    O how sweet it is to perish with a patience that is pleased   how   fearful  how horrible  to die struggling and kicking against the   Almighty       As we went gently along  still mutually supporting and exhorting   each other  I applied for alms from time to time to a number of   passengers   but my voice and address were so feebly importunate    or their attention was so engaged on distant and different matters    that my oratory returned as empty as it set out      At length I met a poor beggar man  with a wife and seven   children following in a train  I looked at him wistfully  and  having   civilly saluted him  I entreated some little matter from his bag or   his can  to keep my infant from perishing on the highway  God s   mercy  master   said the charitable mendicant  I am very sorry to   see any body poorer than myself  but the truth is  that I have   travelled a great way  and have eat and drank all except this last   twopence halfpenny  Here it is  master   God s blessing go along   with it   I grieve  and shall grieve  that it is not two pounds for   your sake      In expectation of the refreshment we should derive from this   supply  we kept on at a creeping pace till we came to a little ale    house that stands about half a mile from this town  There we en    tered  and called for a pennyworth of bread and a pint of drink          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  119     with some milk for the child  While we sat to repose ourselves    the poor man of the house having eyed me with a kind of earnest   compassion You look  said he  to be in much trouble   but if your   trouble is of a kind that may be cured  there is one Mr  Fenton at   hand  whom God nas placed in this country  as the sun in heaven    to give comfort to all within his reach      My heart revived within me at these tidings  and was further   prophetic of some happy revolution  Having finished our pint  and   laid up the remainder of our bread in store  we discharged our   reckoning  and set out on our last stage      The prospect of speedy relief  and the possibility that it might   not arrive too late  gave us spirits beyond our powers  and we   pushed on till we came nearly opposite to this house  though we   did not then know to
