 wants to have a word in your ear  be so good  if you please  as just to step to his office  without loss of time  An Arabian merchant  who supped with you last night  has laid an information respecting a certain act of irreverence perpetrated by you  on occasion of a dog which you buried  It is on that charge that I summon you to appear this day before the judge  and in case of failure  you are hereby warned that you will be the subject of a criminal prosecution  Away went he  leaving me to digest his discourse  but the citation stuck in my throat  and took away my appetite  The Arabian had no reason whatever to set his face against me  and I could not comprehend the meaning of the dog s trick the scoundrel had played me  The circumstance at all events demanded my prompt attention  I knew the cadi s character  a saint on the outside  but a sinner in his heart  Away went I therefore to wait on this judge  but not with empty pockets  He sent for me into his private room  and began upon me in all the vehemence of pious indignation  You are a fellow rejected out of paradise  a blasphemer of our holy law  a man loathsome and abominable to look upon  You have performed the funeral service of a Mussulman over a dog  What an act of sacrilege  Is it thus  then  that you reverence our most holy ceremonies  Have you only turned Mahometan to laugh at our devotions and our rites  My honoured master  answered I  the Arabian who has told you such a cock and bull story is a wolf in sheep s clothing  and more than that  he is even an accomplice in my crime  if it is one  to grant such rest as to peace parted souls to a faithful household servant  to an animal with more good qualities than half the two legged Mahometans out of Christendom  His attachment besides to people of merit and consideration in the world was at once moral and sensible  and at his death he left several little tokens of remembrance to his friends  By his last will and testament  he bequeathed his effects in the manner therein mentioned  and did me the honour to name me for his executor  This old crony came in for twenty crowns  that for thirty  and another for a cool hundred  but your worship is interested deeply in this instrument  pursued I  drawing out my purse  he has left you residuary legatee  and here is the amount of the bequest  The cadi s gravity could not but relax  after the posthumous kindness of his deceased friend  and he laughed outright in the face of the mock executor  As we were alone  there was no occasion to make wry mouths at the purse  and my acquittal was pronounced in these words  Go  Master Sidy Hali  it was a very pious act of yours  to enlarge the obsequies of a dog  who had so manly a fellow feeling for honest folks   By this device I got out of the scrape  and if the hint did not increase my religion  it doubled my circumspection  I was determined no longer to open either my cellar or my soul in presence of Arabian or Jew  My bottle companion henceforward was a young gentleman from Leghorn  who had the happiness of being my slave  His name was Azarini  I was of another kidney from renegadoes in general  who impose greater hardships on their Christian slaves than do the Turks themselves  All my captives waited for the period of their ransom  without any impatient hankering after home  My behaviour to them was  in truth  so gentle and fatherly  that many of them assured me they were more afraid of changing their master than anxious after their liberty  whatever magic that word may have to the ears of those who have felt what it is to be deprived of it   One day the bashaw s corsairs came into port with considerable prizes  Their cargo amounted to more than a hundred slaves of either sex  carried off from the Spanish coast  Soliman retained but a very small number  and all the rest were sold  I happened to go to market  and bought a Spanish girl  ten or twelve years old  She cried as if her heart would break  and looked the picture of despair  It seemed strange  that at her age slavery should make such an impression on her  I told her  in Castilian  to combat with her terrors  and assured her that she was fallen into the hands of a master who had not put off humanity when he took up the turban  The little mourner  not initiated in the trade of grief  pursued the subject of her lamentations without listening to me  Her whole soul seemed to be breathed in her sighs  she descanted on her wretched fate  and exclaimed from time to time in softened accents  O my mother  why were we ever parted  I could bear my lot with patience  might we share it together  With these lamentations on her lips  she turned round towards a woman of from five and forty to fifty  standing at the distance of several paces  and waiting with
