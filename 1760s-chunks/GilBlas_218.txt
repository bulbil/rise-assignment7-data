of a more charming character  One might still conclude from the turn of her countenance  and from the spirit not yet quenched in her eyes  that in her youth the catgut of many a guitar must have been fretted under her window  As a proof of this  she had many trials what a state of widowhood was  her husbands had all been of noble birth  and her finances were flourishing on the accumulation of her several jointures   Among other admirable qualities  she had that of not visiting severely the frailties of her own sex  When I let her into the secret of mine  she entered so warmly into my interests  as to speak of Zendono with more sincerity than good manners  What graceless fellows these men are  said she in a tone from which one might infer that she had met with some light fingered steward in the passing of her accounts  They would not be worth picking off a dunghill  if one could do without them  There is a large fraternity of sorry scoundrels in the world  who make it their sport to gain the hearts of women  and then desert them  There is  however  one consoling circumstance  my dear child  According to your account  you are by no means bound fast to that faithless Biscayan  If your marriage with him was sufficiently formal to save your credit with the world  on the other hand  it was contracted loosely enough to admit of your trying your luck at a better match  whenever an opportunity may fall in your way   I went out every day with Dorothea  either to church  or to visit among her friends  both likely occasions of picking up an adventure  so that I attracted the notice of several gentlemen  There were some of them who had a mind to feel how the land lay  They made their proposals to my venerable protectress  but these had not wherewithal to defray the expenses of an establishment  and those were mere unfledged boys under age  an insuperable objection  which left me very little merit in turning a deaf ear to them  One day a whim seized Dorothea and me  to go and see a play at Seville  The bills announced a favourite and standard piece  El Embaxador de Si mismo  written by Lope de Vega   Among the actresses who came upon the stage  I discovered one of my old cronies  It was impossible to have forgotten Phenicia  that bouncing good humoured girl whom you have seen as Florimonde s waiting maid  and have supped with more than once at Arsenia s  I was aware that Phenicia had left Madrid above two years ago  but had never heard of her turning actress  I longed so earnestly to embrace her  that the piece appeared quite tedious  Perhaps  too  there might be some fault in those who played it  as being neither good enough nor bad enough to afford me entertainment  For as to my own temper  which is that of seeking diversion wherever I can find it  I must confess that an actor supremely ridiculous answers my purpose just as well as the most finished performer of the age   At last  the moment I had been waiting for being arrived  namely the dropping of the curtain on this favourite and standard piece  we went  for my widow would go with me  behind the scenes  where we caught a glimpse of Phenicia  who was playing off the amiable and unaffected simpleton  and listening with all the primness of studied simplicity to the soft chirping of a young stagefinch  who had evidently suffered himself to be caught in the birdlime of her professional or meretricious talents  No sooner did her eye meet mine  than she quitted him with a genteel apology  ran up to me with open arms  and lavished upon me all the demonstrations of strong attachment imaginable  Our expressions of joy at this unexpected meeting were indeed reciprocal  but neither time nor place admitting of any very copious indulgence in the privilege of asking questions  we adjourned till the following day  with a promise of renewing our mutual inquiries thick and threefold  under the shelter of her friendly roof   The pleasure of talking is the inextinguishable passion of woman  coeval with the act of breathing  I could not get a wink of sleep all night  for the burning desire of having a grapple with Phenicia  and closing in upon her in the conflict of curiosity  Witness all the powers who preside over tattling  whether the love of lying in bed  another passion of woman  prevented me from getting up and flying to my appointment as early as good manners would allow  She lived with the rest of the company in a large ready furnished lodging  A female attendant who met me at entrance  on being requested to shew me Phenicia s apartment  led the way up stairs to a gallery  along which were ranged ten or twelve small rooms  divided only by partitions of deal boards  and inhabited by this merry band  My conductress knocked at a door which Phenicia opened  for her tongue was cruelly on the fidget to be let loose  as well as my own  We allowed ourselves no time for the impertinent ceremonies which usually usher in a visit  but plunged at once into a most furious career of loquacity
