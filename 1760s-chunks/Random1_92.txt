the chance of battle —It was almost dark when we came up with the sternmost chace  which we hailed  and enquired who they were  they gave us to understand they were French men of war  upon which captain Oakhum commanded them to send their boat on board of him  but they refused  telling him  if he had any business with them  to come on board of their ship  He then threatned to pour in a broad side upon them  which they promised to return —Both sides were as good as their word  and the engagement began with great fury —The reader may guess how I passed my time  lying in this helpless situation  amidst the terrors of a sea fight  expecting every moment to be cut asunder or dashed in pieces by the enemy s shot  I endeavoured to compose myself as much as possible  by reflecting that I was not a whit more exposed than those who were stationed about me  but when I beheld them employed without intermission  in annoying the foe  and encouraged by the society and behaviour of one another  I   263 could easily perceive a wide difference between their condition and mine  However  I concealed my agitation as well as I could  till the head of the officer of Marines  who stood near me  being shot off  bounced from the deck athwart my face  leaving me well nigh blinded with brains —I could contain myself no longer  but began to bellow with all the strength of my lungs  when a drummer coming towards me  asked if I was wounded  and before I could answer  received a great shot in his belly which tore out his intrails  and he fell flat on my breast —This accident entirely bereft me of all discretion  I redoubled my cries  which were drowned in the noise of the battle  and finding myself disregarded  lost all patience and became frantick  vented my rage in oaths and execrations  till my spirits being quite exhausted  I remained quiet and insensible of the load that oppressed me —The engagement lasted till broad day  when captain Oakhum  finding he was like to gain neither honour nor advantage by the affair  pretended to be undeceived by seeing their colours  and hailing the ship with whom he had fought all night  protested he believed them Spaniards  and the guns being silenced on each side  ordered the barge to be hoisted out  and went on board of the French commodore —Our loss amounted to ten killed and eighteen wounded  most part of whom afterwards died —My fellow mates had no sooner dispatched their business in the cockpit  than full of friendly concern  they came to visit me —Morgan ascending first  and seeing my face almost covered with brains and blood  concluded I was no longer a man for this world  and calling to Thomson with great emotion  bid him   264 come up and take his last farewel of his comrade and countryman  who was posting to a petter place  where there were no Mackshanes nor Oakhums to asperse and torment him —   No  said he  taking me by the hand  you are going to a country where there is more respect shewn to unfortunate shentlemen  and where you will have the satisfaction of peholding your adversaries tossing upon pillows of purning primstone  —  Thomson alarmed at this apostrophe  made haste to the place where I lay  and sitting down by me  with tears in his eyes  enquired into the nature of my calamity —By this time I had recollected myself so far as to be able to converse rationally with my friends  whom  to their great satisfaction  I immediately undeceived with regard to their apprehension of my being mortally wounded —After I had got myself disengaged from the carnage in which I wallowed  and partaken of a refreshment which my friends brought along with them  we entered into discourse upon the hardships we sustained  and spoke very freely of the authors of our misery  which being over heard by the centinel who guarded me  he was no sooner relieved  than he reported to the captain every syllable of our conversation  according to the orders he had received  The effects of this soon appeared in the arrival of the master at arms  who replaced Morgan in his former station  and gave the second mate a caution to keep a strict guard over his tongue  if he did not chuse to accompany us in our confinement —Thomson foreseeing that the whole slavery of attending and dressing the sick and wounded  must now fall upon his shoulders  as well as the ill usage of Mackshane  grew desperate at the prospect    265 and though I never heard him swear before  imprecated dreadful curses on the heads of his oppressors  declaring  that he would rather quit life altogether  than be much longer under the power of such barbarians —I was not a little startled at his vivacity  and endeavoured to alleviate his complaints  by representing the subject of my own  with as much aggravation as it would bear  by which comparison he might see the balance of misfortune lay on my side  and take an example from me of fortitude and submission  till such time as we could procure redress  which  I hoped  was not far off  considering  that we should probably be in a harbour in less
