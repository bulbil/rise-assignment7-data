is no one now about the king who has credit enough to stand in my way  or even  as I am aware  the slightest inclination to do me mischief   It is true  continued he  that on my accession to the ministry  it was my first care to remove all hangers on from about the prince but those of my own family or connections  By means of viceroyalties or embassies I got rid of all the nobility who  by their personal merit  could have interfered with me in the good graces of the sovereign  whom I mean to engross entirely to myself  in that I may say at the present moment  no statesman of the time holds me in check by the ascendancy of his personal influence  You see  Gil Blas  I open my mind to you  As I have reason to think that you are mine heart and soul  I have chosen to put you in possession of everything  You are a clever youth  with reflection  penetration  and discretion  in short  you are just the very creature to acquit yourself of all possible little offices in all possible directions  you are also a young fellow of very promising parts  and must in the nature of things be in my interests   There was no standing the attack which these flattering representations were calculated to make upon the weakly defended fortress of my philosophy  Unauthorized whims of avarice and ambition mounted suddenly into my head  and brought forward certain sentiments of political speculation which were supposed to have been in abeyance  I gave the minister an assurance that I should fulfil his intentions to the utmost of my power  and held myself in readiness to execute without examination or inference all the orders it might be his pleasure to give me   While I was thus disposed to take fortune in her affable fit  Scipio returned from his peregrination  I have no long story for you  said he  The lords of Leyva were delighted at your reception from the king  and at the manner in which the Count of Olivarez and you came to understand one another   My friend  said I  you would have delighted them still more  had you been able to tell them on what a footing I am now with my lord  My advances since your departure have been prodigious  Happy man be his dole  my dear master  answered he  my mind forebodes that we shall cut a figure   Let us change the subject  said I  and talk of Oviedo  You have been in the Asturias  How did you leave my mother  Ah  sir  replied he  with an undertaker s decency of countenance  I have a melancholy tale to tell you from that quarter  O heaven  exclaimed I  my mother then is dead  Six months since  said my secretary  did the good lady pay the debt of nature  and your uncle  Signor Gil Perez  about the same period   My mother s death preyed upon my susceptible nature  though in my childhood I had not received from her those little fondling indications of maternal love  so necessary to amalgamate with the more serious convictions of filial duty  The good canon  too  came in for his share in bringing me up according to the rules of godliness and honesty  My serious grief was not lasting  but I never lost sight of a certain tender recollection  whenever the idea of my dear relations shot across my mind       CH  IX      How my lord duke married his only daughter  and to whom  with the bitter consequences of that marriage   VERY shortly after the son of Coselina s return  my lord duke fell into a brown study  and it lasted a complete week  I conceived  of course  that he was brooding over some great measure of government  but family concerns were the object of his musings  Gil Blas  said he one day after dinner  you may perceive that my mind is a good deal distracted  Yes  my good friend  I am pondering over an affair of the utmost consequence to my feelings  You shall know all about it   My daughter  Donna Maria  pursued he  is marriageable  and of course beset with suitors  The Count de Niéblés  eldest son of the Duke de Medina Sidonia  head of the Guzman family  and Don Lewis de Haro  eldest son of the Marquis de Carpio and my eldest sister  are the two most likely competitors  The latter in particular is superior in point of merit to all his rivals  so that the whole court has fixed on him for my son in law  Nevertheless  without entering into private motives for treating him  as well as the Count de Niéblés  with a refusal  my present views are fixed upon Don Ramires Nunez de Guzman  Marquis of Toni  head of the Guzmans d Abrados  another branch of the family  To that nobleman and his progeny by my daughter I mean to leave all my property  and to entail on them the title of Count d Olivarez  with the additional dignity of grandee  so that my grandchildren and their descendants  issue of the Abrados and Olivarez branch  will be considered as taking precedence in the house
