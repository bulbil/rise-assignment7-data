the paper which she had written  and made me sign  and asked him what he knew of the contents   He knew not what had passed between his mother and me  nor did Clementina   He told her  that I had actually made those proposals  He assured her  that I loved her above all women  He acquainted her with my mistress   She pitied me  She thought  she said  that I had not made any overtures  any concessions  that I despised her  and sensibly asked  Why the Chevalier was sent for from Vienna  We all knew his mind  as to religion  said she   Then  after a pause  He never could have perverted me  proceeded she  He would have allowed me a confestor  would he not   He would  answered Jeronymo—And he would have left me among my friends in Italy —He would    314 replied he —Well  brother  and I should have been glad perhaps to have seen England once  and he would perhaps have brought over his sisters and his father to visit us  And he praises them highly  you know  And if I were their sister  I could have gone over with them  you know  Do you think  if I had loved them  they would not have loved me  I am not an ill natured creature  you know  and they must be courteous  Are they not his sisters  And don t you think his father would love me  I should have brought no dishonour into his family  you know  —Well  but I ll tell you what  Jeronymo  He is really a tender hearted man  I talked to him of his Soul  and  upon my honour  I believe I could have prevailed  in time  Father Marescotti is a severe man  you know  and he has been always so much consulted  and don t love the Chevalier  I believe  So that I fancy  if I were to have a venerable sweet tempered man for my confessor  between my Love  and my confessor s Prudence  we should gain a Soul —Don t you think so  Jeronymo —And that should cover a great many sins  And all his family might be converted too  you know   He encouraged her in this way of thinking  She believed  she said  that I was not yet gone  He is so tender hearted  brother  that is my dependence  And you say  he loves me  Are you sure of that —But I have reason to think he does  He shed tears  as I talked to him  more than once  while my eyes were as dry as they are now  I did not shed one tear  Well  I ll go to him  and talk with him   She went to the door  but came back on tiptoe  and in a whispering accent—My mamma is coming  Hush  Jeronymo  let Hush be the word —  The door opened—Here  madam  is your girl —But it is not my mamma  The impertinent Camilla  She follows me as my shadow   My Lady desires to see you  Lady Clementina  in her dressing room     315 I obey  But where is the Chevalier   Gone  madam  Gone some time   Ah  brother  said she  and her countenance fell   What  gone  said Jeronymo  without seeing me  Unkind Grandison  He did not use to be so unkind   This was the substance of the advices sent me by my friend Jeronymo   I acquainted him in return  by pen and ink  with all that had passed between the Marchioness and me  that he might not  by his friendship for me  involve himself in difficulties   In the morning I had a visit from Camilla  by her Lady s command  with excuses for refusing to allow me to take leave of Clementina  She hoped I was not displeased with her on that account  It was the effect of prudence  and not disrespect  She should ever regard me  even in a tender manner  as if the desired relation could have taken place  Her Lord  and his brother the Conte della Porretta  as he is called  with the General and the Bishop  arrived the night before  accompanied by the Count s eldest son  Signor Sebastiano  She had been much blamed for permitting the interview  but regretted it the less  as her beloved daughter was more composed than before  and gave sedate answers to all the questions put to her  But  nevertheless  she wished that I would retire from Bologna  for Clementina s sake  as well as for my own   Camilla added from Signor Jeronymo  that he wished to hear from me from the Trentine  or Venice  And as from herself  and in confidence  that her young Lady was greatly concerned  that I did not wait on her again before I went away  That she fell into a silent fit upon it  and that her mamma  on her not answering to her questions  for the first time  chid her  That this gave her great distress  but produced what they had so much wished for
