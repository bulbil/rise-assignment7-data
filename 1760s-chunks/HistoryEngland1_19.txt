kingdom  but their raptures were soon suppressed by an information  that William of Normandy  sirnamed the Conqueror  had landed at Hastings  with a vast body of disciplined veterans  and laid claim to the English crown   This Prince was the natural son of Robert Duke of Normandy  his mother s name was Arlette  a beautiful maid of Falaize  with whom Robert fell in love  as she stood gazing at her door whilst he passed through the town  William  who was the offspring of this amour  owed his greatness to his birth  and his fortunes to his personal merit  His body was vigorous  his mind capacious  and his courage not to be intimidated  His father  Robert  growing old  and  as was usual with Princes of that age  superstitious  resolved upon a visit to the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem  The nobility used every argument to dissuade him  but the persisted in his design  He shewed them William  whom  though illegitimate  he tenderly loved  recommending him to their care and loyalty  He then exacted their homage and fealty to this Prince  not yet above ten years old  and then   55 put him under the tutelage of the French King  in whom he placed the highest confidence   Robert  soon after going into Asia  and dying  left his son rather inheritor of his wishes than his crown  Our young soldier found himself at once exposed to many dangers  from his youth and inexperience  from the reproach of his birth  a suspected guardian  a disputed title  and a distracted state  However  he surmounted all with uncommon fortitude and bravery  nor  till he had established peace  order  and tranquillity  in his own kingdom  did he turn his ambitious views abroad   It has been already seen  that Edward the Confessor  in flying from his enemies  resided for a long time at the court of Robert  Duke of Normandy  and upon this William founded his claim  Whether gratitude might engage this exiled Prince to make William  his benefactor s son  any promises of the kingdom of England  after his decease  is  at this distance of time  uncertain  William  however  upon the death of Edward  immediately made his pretensions  and  upon the former promise of Edward  founded all the justice of his demaud  To this he added  that Harold had himself assured him of his interest in the succession  when forced upon the Norman coast  and he therefore sent to remind him of fulfilling his engagements   Harold admitted of neither of these claims  and resolved to defend  by his valour  what he had acquired by his intrigues  He was at the head of a large army  lately victorious  and now confident  He observed  that he had been elected by those who only had the power of placing Kings on the throne  namely  by the people  and that he could not resign his crown without a breach of   56 that trust reposed in him by his constituents  He added to these reasons one of still greater weight  he was possessed of power  and knew how to defend his property   William  who had landed his army at Hastings in Sussex  about the beginning of October  at first made no appearance of invading an hostile country  but rather of incamping in his own  But he was soon roused from his inactivity by the approach of Harold  who returned from the defeat of the Norwegians  with all the forces he had employed in that expedition  and all he could invite  or collect  in the country through which he passed  These were  in general  brave  active  and valiant troops  in high spirits  strongly attached to their King  and eager to engage  The army of William  on the other hand  consisted of the flower of all the continent  the troops of Bretagne  Brabant  Bologne  Flanders  Poictou  Maine  Orleans  France  and his own  were united under his command  He had long been familiar with conquest  and his troops were confident of his military capacity  England  never before  nor ever since  saw two such armies drawn up to dispute its crown  The day before the battle William sent an offer to Harold  to decide the quarrel between them by single combat  and thus spare the blood of their people  but Harold refused  and said he would leave it to God to determine  Both armies  therefore  that night pitched in sight of each other  expecting the next terrible day with sollicitude  the English passed the night in songs and feasting  the Normans in devotion and prayer   The next morning  at seven  as soon as day appeared  both armies drew up in array against   57 each other  Harold appeared  leading on the centre of the English army  on foot  that his men might be more encouraged by seeing their King exposed to equal danger with themselves  William fought on horseback  and commanded the body of reserve  The Normans began the fight with their cross bows  these at first galled and surprized the English  and  as their ranks were close  the arrows did great execution
