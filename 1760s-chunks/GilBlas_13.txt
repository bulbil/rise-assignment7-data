an old gentleman with a family of boys  one of whom had entered the Church  when he ended his lifework  by the publication of the third part  in 1735  Gil Blas  in short  is the product of the maturity of one of the keenest observers that ever looked out upon the spectacle of things  The broad good humoured gaiety of the earlier book  which vibrates with a picaresque lilt  is shaded gradually down  in the second volume  into a finer  serener  more intellectual irony  This change betrays the natural evolution in the author s interests and curiosities during the period reaching from his forty seventh to his sixty seventh year  The gaiety of the six books of the first part is to be contrasted with the soberer  more reflective spirit of the tale as it proceeds  We seem to be suiting our pace to the increasingly graver temper of a man whose knowledge of life has become richer  his insight keener  his heart more tolerant and generous  With the steady elimination of the picaresque element the novel becomes more and more an inclusive criticism of life  The author seems to be brooding over his pages with a tenderer care  as if he were more and more conscious of the significance  the magnificence even  of his task   It is one of the results of this long gestation that Gil Blas has become a book of world wide popularity  In the history of letters it has been an inexhaustible source of energy  It inspired the realistic novel  From Smollett and Marivaux to Dickens and Zola  and even to an Anatole France and to a Pio Baroja  Lesage has been the avowed or unavowed model of those writers who have been passionately enamoured of life  and irrepressibly compelled to express it  The influence of Lesage on the author  for instance  of Le Rouge et le Noir and of La Chartreuse de Parme    perhaps particularly on the Stendhal of the Chartreuse de Parme    seems incontestable  In August 1804  Beyle  writing to his sister Pauline  recommends her to read Gil Blas in order to learn to know the world  and cites the famous anecdote of the Archbishop of Granada s sermons  In April 1805  he promises to bring her the book  In another undated letter to his sister  Beyle writes   the most accurate picture of human nature as it is  in the France of the eighteenth century  is still the book of Lesage  Gil Blas  Meditate well this excellent work   And finally  in his Journal  under the date of  10 Floréal  an xiii  1805   Beyle notes his intention to cure himself of romanticism  and to learn to judge men as they are  by re reading a certain number of books  among which he mentions Beaumarchais  the tales and La Pucelle of Voltaire  Chamfort  and Gil Blas  That is to say  at the most impressionable period of his intellectual life Beyle read and re read Gil Blas  a fact which a discerning critic might easily guess  as to the truth of which  indeed  such a critic would feel an absolute conviction  and which the documents cited appear to leave beyond a doubt It would perhaps be an exaggeration to pretend that but for Gil Blas  Beyle would not have been Stendhal  but I may be permitted to quote the following passage from a private letter of M  Paul Arbelet  the editor of Stendhal s Journal d Italie   Votre hypothèse me parait très séduisante  Il y a sans aucun doute quelque parenté intellectuelle entre Lesage et Stendhal  tous deux curieux d observation morale  tous deux juges sans illusions des faiblesses humaines  mais point misanthropes  car ils s indignent peu des vices ou des ridicules  qui les amusent plutôt ou les intéressent  D ailleurs l un et l autre manquent d imagination et de poésie  Je comprends donc très bien que vous ayez eu l idée d une influence de Lesage sur Stendhal    Furthermore  while Lesage is all this  the fountain head of a great literary current  he is at the same time  as a moralist  in the sanest Latin and French tradition  that which is marked  in successive epochs  by the serene temper of a Horace  by the gay science  the pantagruelism of a Rabelais  by the irony of a Beaumarchais  who  se hâta de rire de tout  de peur d être obligé d en pleurer   and finally by the tranquil mansuetude of a Renan  observers  one and all  who  after having told the towers of all the citadels of science  became amusedly aware that the only really absolute truth in the world is that all things are relative   HISTORY OF GIL BLAS OF SANTILLANE       BOOK THE FIRST       CH  I     The birth and education of Gil Blas   MY father  Blas of Santillane  after having borne arms for a long time in the Spanish service  retired to his native place  There he married a chamber maid who was not exactly in her teens  and I made my debut on this stage ten months after marriage  They afterwards went to live at Oviedo  where my mother got into service  and my father obtained
