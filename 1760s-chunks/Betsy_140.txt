am a single man  I shall   have a crowd of gay young fellows continually coming to my house  and I   cannot answer that all of them would be able to behave with that strict   decorum  which I should wish to see always observed towards a person so   near to me  Her presence  perhaps  might be some check upon them  and   theirs no less disagreeable to her  In fine  Mr  Goodman   continued he     it is a thing wholly inconsistent with that freedom I propose to live   in  and would not have her think on it        It was not that this gentleman wanted natural affection for his sister    that he refused what he was sensible she so much desired  but he was at   present so circumstanced  that  to have complied  would  under a shew of   kindness  have done her a real injury  He had brought with him a young   and very beautiful mistress from Paris  of whom he was fond  and jealous   to that extravagant degree  that he could scarce suffer her a moment   from his sight  he had promised her the sole command of his house and   servants  and that she should appear as his wife in all respects except   the name  How could he  therefore  bring home a sister  who had a right   to  and doubtless would have claimed  all those privileges another was   already in possession of  And how would it have agreed with the   character of a virtuous young lady  to have lived in the same house   with a woman kept by her brother as his mistress       But this was a secret Miss Betsy was as yet wholly unacquainted with    and when Mr  Goodman repeated to her what had passed between them on her   score  and the excuse her brother had made for not complying with the   proposal  she thought it so weak  and withal so unkind  that she could   not forbear bursting into tears  The good natured old gentleman could   not see her thus afflicted without being extremely concerned  and saying   many kind things to pacify her   Do not weep   said he   I will make it   my business  nay my study  to procure some place where you may be   boarded to your satisfaction     I beg  Sir  that you will not mistake   my meaning  I do assure you  Sir  I am not wanting in sensibility of   your goodness to all our family  and to me in particular  I must    indeed  be strangely stupid not to think myself happy under the   protection of a gentleman of so humane and benign a disposition  No    Sir  be persuaded there is no house in London  except that of an own   brother  I would prefer to yours  I will  therefore  with your   permission  continue here  nor entertain the least thought of removing    unless some accident  yet unforeseen  obliges me to it        Mr  Goodman then told her  that he should be glad she would always do   what was most for her own ease  This was all the discourse they had upon   this head  and when Miss Betsy began to consider seriously on the   behaviour of Lady Mellasin and Miss Flora  she found there was little   reason for her to regret the loss of their society  nor that she ought   to think Mr  Goodman s house less agreeable for their being out of it    She received all such as she approved of  who had come to visit them    and by doing so  were acquainted with her  and as to those who still   visited herself in particular  it was the same as ever  Mr  Goodman s   kinswoman  now his housekeeper  was a well bred  accomplished woman  and   a chearful  agreeable companion  She seemed studious to oblige her  all   the servants were ready to do every thing she desired  and it would have   been difficult for her to have found any place where she could have been   better accommodated  or have had more cause to be contented  and she   would doubtless have thought herself more happy than she had ever been   since her coming to Mr  Goodman s  if other things  of a different   nature  had not given her some unquiet moments       But  besides the unkindness of one brother  on whom she had built the   most pleasing hopes  and the indisposition of another  for whom she had   a very great affection  the late behaviour of Mr  Trueworth gave her   much matter of mortification  She had not seen him for upwards of a   week  she imputed this absence to the rebuff she had given him at his
