 had marked him for an easy prey  I therefore asked the circumstances of his deception  He sold the horse  it seems  and walked the fair in search of another  A reverend looking man brought him to a tent  under  Page  121  a pretence of having one to sell    Here    continued Moses    we met another man  very well drest  who desired to borrow twenty pounds upon these  saying  that he wanted money  and would dispose of them for a third of the value  The first gentleman  who pretended to be my friend  whispered me to buy them  and cautioned me not to let so good an offer pass  I sent for Mr  Flamborough  and they talked him up as finely as they did me  and so at last we were persuaded to buy the two groce between us      Page   unnumbered   CHAP  XIII   Mr  Burchell is found to be an enemy  for he has the confidence to give disagreeable advice   OUR family had now made several attempts to be fine  but some unforeseen disaster demolished each as soon as projected  I endeavoured to take the advantage of every disappointment  to improve their good sense in proportion as they were frustrated in ambition    You see  my children    cried I    how little is to be got by attempts to impose upon the world  in coping with our betters  Such as are poor and will associate with none but the rich  are hated by those they avoid  and despised by these they follow  Unequal combinations are always disadvantageous  Page  124  to the weaker side  the rich having the pleasure  and the poor the inconveniencies that result from them  But come  Dick  my boy  and repeat the fable that you were reading to day  for the good of the company         Once upon a time    cried the child    a Giant and a Dwarf were friends  and kept together  They made a bargain that they would never forsake each other  but go seek adventures  The first battle they fought was with two Saracens  and the Dwarf  who was very courageous  dealt one of the champions a most angry blow  It did the Saracen but very little injury  who lifting up his sword  fairly struck off the poor Dwarf s arm  He was now in a woeful plight  but the Giant coming to his assistance  in a short time left the two Saracens dead on the plain  and the Dwarf cut off the dead man s head out of spite  They then travelled on to another adventure  This was against three bloody minded  Page  125  Satyrs  who were carrying away a damsel in distress  The Dwarf was not quite so fierce now as before  but for all that  struck the first blow  which was returned by another  that knocked out his eye  but the Giant was soon up with them  and had they not fled  would certainly have killed them every one  They were all very joyful for this victory  and the damsel who was relieved fell in love with the Giant  and married him  They now travelled far  and farther than I can tell  till they met with a company of robbers  The Giant  for the first time  was foremost now  but the Dwarf was not far behind  The battle was stout and long  Wherever the Giant came all fell before him  but the Dwarf had like to have been killed more than once  At last the victory declared for the two adventurers  but the Dwarf lost his leg  The Dwarf was now without an arm  a leg  and an eye  while the Giant  who was without a single wound  cried out to him  Come  Page  126  on  my little heroe  this is glorious sport  let us get one victory more  and then we shall have honour for ever  No  cries the Dwarf  who was by this time grown wiser  no  I declare off  I ll fight no more  for I find in every battle that you get all the honour and rewards  but all the blows fall upon me      I was going to moralize this fable  when our attention was called off to a warm dispute between my wife and Mr  Burchell  upon my daughters intended expedition to town  My wife very strenuously insisted upon the advantages that would result from it  Mr  Burchell  on the contrary  dissuaded her with great ardor  and I stood neuter  His present dissuasions seemed but the second part of those which were received with so ill a grace in the morning  The dispute grew high  while poor Deborah  instead of reasoning stronger  talked louder  and at last was obliged to take shelter from a defeat in clamour  The  Page  127  conclusion of her harangue  however  was highly displeasing to us all  she knew  she said  of some who had their own secret reasons for what they advised  but  for her part  she wished such to stay away from her house
