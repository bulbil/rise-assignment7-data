her embraces  flung out at the door  and  halted homewards with such surprising speed  that the lieutenant could  not overtake him until he had arrived at his own gate  and Mrs   Grizzle was so much affected with his escape  that her sister  in pure  compassion  desired she would not afflict herself  protesting that her  own wish was already gratified  for she had plucked three hairs at once   having from the beginning been dubious of the commodore s patience     6 22 15  3 45 PM   But the labours of this assiduous kinswoman did not end with the  achievement of this adventure  her eloquence or industry was employed  without ceasing in the performance of other tasks imposed by the  ingenious craft of her sister in law  who at another time conceived an  insuppressible affection for a fricassee of frogs  which should be the  genuine natives of France  so that there was a necessity for despatching  a messenger on purpose to that kingdom  but as she could not depend  upon the integrity of any common servant  Mrs  Grizzle undertook that  province  and actually set sail in a cutter for Boulogne  from whence  she returned in eight and forty hours with a tub full of those live  animals  which being dressed according to art  her sister did not  taste them  on pretence that her fit of longing was past  but then her  inclinations took a different turn  and fixed themselves upon a curious  implement belonging to a lady of quality in the neighbourhood  which  was reported to be a great curiosity  this was no other than a porcelain  chamber pot of admirable workmanship  contrived by the honourable owner   who kept it for her own private use  and cherished it as a utensil of  inestimable value   Mrs  Grizzle shuddered at the first hint  she received of her sister s  desire to possess this piece of furniture  because she knew it was not  to be purchased  and the lady s character  which was none of the most  amiable in point of humanity and condescension  forbad all hopes of  borrowing it for a season  she therefore attempted to reason down this  capricious appetite  as an extravagance of imagination which ought to be  combated and repressed  and Mrs  Pickle  to all appearance was convinced  and satisfied by her arguments and advice  but  nevertheless  could make  use of no other convenience  and was threatened with a very dangerous  suppression  Roused at the peril in which she supposed her to be   Mrs  Grizzle flew to the lady s house  and  having obtained a private  audience  disclosed the melancholy situation of her sister  and implored  the benevolence of her ladyship  who  contrary to expectation  received  her very graciously  and consented to indulge Mrs  Pickle s longing  Mr   Pickle began to be out of humour at the expense to which he was exposed  by the caprice of his wife  who was herself alarmed at this last  accident  and for the future kept her fancy within bounds  insomuch   that without being subject to any more extraordinary trouble  Mrs   Grizzle reaped the long wished fruits of her dearest expectation in the  birth of a fine boy  whom her sister in a few months brought into the  world   I shall omit the description of the rejoicings  which were infinite on  this important occasion  and only observe that Mrs  Pickle s mother and  aunt stood godmothers  and the commodore assisted at the ceremony as  godfather to the child  who was christened by the name of Peregrine  in  compliment to the memory of a deceased uncle  While the mother confined  to her bed  and incapable of maintaining her own authority  Mrs  Grizzle  took charge of the infant baby double claim  and superintended  with  surprising vigilance  the nurse and midwife in all the particulars of  their respective offices  which were performed by her express direction   But no sooner was Mrs  Pickle in a condition to reassume the management  of her own affairs  when she thought proper to alter certain regulations  concerning the child  which had obtained in consequence of her sister s  orders  directing  among other innovations  that the bandages with which  the infant had been so neatly rolled up  like an Egyptian mummy  should  be loosened and laid aside  in order to rid nature of all restraint   and give the blood free scope to circulate  and  with her own hands she    6 22 15  3 45 PM   plunged him headlong every morning into a tub full of cold water  This  operation seemed so barbarous to the tender hearted Mrs  Grizzle  that  she not only opposed it with all her eloquence  shedding abundance of  tears over the sacrifice when it was made  and took horse immediately   and departed for the habitation of an eminent country physician  whom  she consulted in these words   Pray  doctor  is it not both dangerous  and cruel to be the means of letting a poor tender infant perish
