me some account of their brother s  Sir Thomas went on in the same gay fluttering way that he had done all his life  The Love of pleasure  as it is called  was wrought into his habit  He was a sl•ve to it  and to what he called freedom  He was deemed one of the best companions among men  and one of the gallantest men among women  His advantages of person and mind were snares to him  Mrs  Oldham was not the only one of her sex with whom he was intimate  He had another mistress in town  who had a taste for all its gaieties  and who even assumed his name   He would row and then  by way of excursion  and to surprise the young Ladies  visit Grandison hall  but tho  it was once the seat he most delighted in  neither gave  nor seamed to receive  much pleasure there  hurrying away on a sudden  as if he had escaped from   144 it  tho  never father had more reason to be pleased with the conduct and duty of daughters  And this he often declared  boasting of them in their absence  but snubbing  chiding  and studying to find fault with them  when present   But what equally surprised and affected them  was  that his son had not been a year abroad  when he prohibited them to write to  or correspond with him  and  by their brother s discontinuing to write to them  from about the same time  they supposed that he was under the same prohibition  And so  it seems  he was   They presumed  their father s reason for this unkind prohibition was  his fear that his gaieties would have been one of the subjects of the correspondence  and the rather  as those gaieties were so likely to affect all three in their fortunes   The young Ladies  however  for some time  continued writing to their brother  Miss Grandison  in mentioning this  said  in her ususal sprightly manner  that she never had any notion of obeying unreasonable commands  commands so evidently unreasonable as to be unnatural  And she called upon me to justify her in her notion  The Countess also desired me to speak my mind on this subject   I am apprehensive  said I  of children s partiality in this respect  If they make themselves their own judges in the performance or non performance of a duty  inclination  I am afraid  will too often be their guide  rather than right reason  They will be too apt  perhaps  to call those commands unnatural  which are not so unnatural as this seems to be   But  Harriet  asked Miss Grandison  would not you have written on  in the like circumstances   I believe not  replied I  and partly for this reason  because I should have had no doubt but my brother would have the same prohibition  and I should only have shewn my brother  as well as my father  were   145 my father to know it  an instance of my refractorines•  without obtaining the desired end  or  if my br•••er had written  I should have made him a part•er in my fault   Your •ower regards the policy of the thing  Harriet  said Miss Grandison  But ought an unnatural command—  There she stopt  Yet by her looks expected me to speak   I should have thought it hard  but that it was more meritorious to submit  than the contrary  I believe I should have supposed  that my father might have reasons which might not appear to me  But pray  Ladies  how did your brother—  O  he was implicit—  Will you forgive me  ladies —I should have been concerned  I think  that my brother  in a point of duty  tho  it were one that might be disputable  should be more nice  more delicate  than I his sister   Miss Emily looked as if she were pleased with me   Well  you are a good girl  a very good girl  said Miss Grandison  That  whether your doctrine be just or not  is out of dispute   This prohibition gave the sisters the more sensible concern  as they were afraid it would lay a foundation for distance and indifference in their brother to them  on whom as their mother had presaged  they were likely  if he survived their father  to have a too great dependence  but more particularly at that time  as their brother had promised  at his taking leave of them  to write a regular account of all that befel him  and of all that was curious  and worthy notice  in the courts and places he visited  and had actually begun to do so  and as he had asked their advice in relation to his governor  who proved not so proper a person for that employment  as was expected  and to which they had answered  without knowing  for some time  what was the resolution he took     146 They asked their father  from time to time  after the welfare of their brother  He would answer them with pleasure  and sometimes with tears in his eyes  He is
