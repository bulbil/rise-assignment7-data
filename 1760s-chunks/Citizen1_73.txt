of the imagination  If a lady stands  something very good may be said upon that  if she happens to fall  with the help of a little fashionable Pruriency  there are forty sly things ready on the occasion  But a prurient jest has always been found to give most pleasure to a few very old gentlemen  who being in some measure dead to other sensations  feel the force of the allusion with double violence on the organs of risibility   An author who writes in this manner is generally sure therefore of having the very old and the impotent among his admirers  for these he may properly be said to write  and from these he ought to expect his reward  his works being often a very proper succedaneum to cantharides  or an assafoetida pill  His pen should be considered in the same light as the squirt of an apothecary  both being directed at the same generous end   But though this manner of writing be perfectly adapted to the taste of gentlemen and ladies of fashion here  yet still it deserves greater praise in being equally suited to the most vulgar apprehensions  The very ladies and gentlemen of Benin  or Cafraria  are in this respect tolerably polite  and might relish a prurient joke of this kind with critical propriety  probably  too  with higher gust  as they wear neither breeches nor petticoats to intercept the application     231It is certain I never could have expected the ladies here  biassed as they are by education  capable at once of bravely throwing off their prejudices  and not only applauding books in which this figure makes the only merit  but even adopting it in their own conversation  Yet so it is  the pretty innocents now carry those books openly in their hands  which formerly were hid under the cushion  they now lisp their double meanings with so much grace  and talk over the raptures they bestow with such little reserve  that I am sometimes reminded of a custom among the entertainers in China  who think it a piece of necessary breeding to whet the appetites of their guests  by letting them smell dinner in the kitchen before it is served up to table   The veneration we have for many things  entirely proceeds from their being carefully concealed  Were the idolatrous Tartar permitted to lift the veil which keeps his idol from view  it might be a certain method to cure his future superstition  with what a noble spirit of freedom therefore must that writer be possessed  who bravely paints things as they are  who lifts the veil of modesty  who displays the most hidden recesses of the temple  and shews the erring people that the object of their vows is either  perhaps a mouse  or a monkey   However  though this figure be at present so much in fashion  though the professors of it are so much caressed by the great  those perfect judges of literary excellence  yet it is confessed to be only a revival of what was once fashionable here before  There was a time  when by this very manner   232 of writing  the gentle Tom  Durfey  as I read in English authors  acquired his great reputation  and became the favourite of a king   The works of this original genius  tho  they never travelled abroad to China  and scarce have reach d posterity at home  were once found upon every fashionable toilet  and made the subject of polite  I mean very polite conversation   Has your Grace seen Mr  Durfey s last new thing  the Oylet Hole  A most facetious piece   Sure  my Lord  all the world must have seen it  Durfey is certainly the most comical creature alive  It is impossible to read his things and live  Was there ever any thing so natural and pretty  as when the Squire and Bridget meet in the cellar  And then the difficulties they both find in broaching the beer barrel are so arch and so ingenious  We have certainly nothing of this kind in the language   In this manner they spoke then  and in this manner they speak now  for though the successor of Durfey does not excel him in wit  the world must confess he out does him in obscenity   There are several very dull fellows  who  by a few mechanical helps  sometimes learn to become extremely brilliant and pleasing  with a little dexterity in the management of the eye brows  fingers  and nose  By imitating a cat  a sow and pigs  by a loud laugh  and a slap on the shoulder  the most ignorant are furnished out for conversation  But the writer finds it impossible to throw his winks  his shrugs  or his attitudes upon paper  he may borrow some assistance indeed  by printing his face at the title   but without wit to pass for a man of ingenuity  no other   233 mechanical help but downright obscenity will suffice  By speaking to some peculiar sensations  we are always sure of exciting laughter  for the jest does not lie in the writer  but in the subject   But Bawdry is often helped on by another figure  called Pertness  and few indeed are found to excell in one that are not possessed of the other   As in common conversation  the best
