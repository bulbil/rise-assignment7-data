 and for all these considerations  and for what   I have heard this day  after you ran away   and I am glad you went as   you did   I cannot persuade you to stay  and I shall be glad   which   is what I never thought I could have said   that you were well at your   father s  for if Lady Davers will entertain you  she may as well have   you from thence as here  There s my good Mrs  Jervis  said I  God will   bless you for your good counsel to a poor maiden  that is hard beset    But pray what did he say  when I was gone  Why  says she  he was very   angry with you  But he would hear it  said I  I think it was a little   bold  but then he provoked me to it  And had not my honesty been in the   case  I would not by any means have been so saucy  Besides  Mrs    Jervis  consider it was the truth  if he does not love to hear of the   summer house  and the dressing room  why should he not be ashamed to   continue in the same mind  But  said she  when you had muttered this to   yourself  you might have told him any thing else  Well  said I  I cannot   tell a wilful lie  and so there s an end of it  But I find you now give   him up  and think there s danger in staying   Lord bless me  I wish I   was well out of the house  so it was at the bottom of a wet ditch  on   the wildest common in England       Why  said she  it signifies nothing to tell you all he said but it was   enough to make me fear you would not be so safe as I could wish    and  upon my word  Pamela  I don t wonder he loves you  for  without   flattery  you are a charming girl  and I never saw you look more lovely   in your life than in that same new dress of yours  And then it was such   a surprise upon us all   I believe truly  you owe some of your danger to   the lovely appearance you made  Then  said I  I wish the clothes in the   fire  I expected no effect from them  but  if any  a quite contrary one       Hush  said I  Mrs  Jervis  did you not hear something stir in the   closet  No  silly girl  said she  your fears are always awake   But   indeed  said I  I think I heard something rustle   May be  says she  the   cat may be got there  but I hear nothing       I was hush  but she said  Pr ythee  my good girl  make haste to bed  See   if the door be fast  So I did  and was thinking to look into the closet    but  hearing no more noise  thought it needless  and so went again and   sat myself down on the bed side  and went on undressing myself  And   Mrs  Jervis being by this time undressed  stepped into bed  and bid me   hasten  for she was sleepy       I don t know what was the matter  but my heart sadly misgave me  Indeed    Mr  Jonathan s note was enough to make it do so  with what Mrs  Jervis   had said  I pulled off my stays  and my stockings  and all my clothes to   an under petticoat  and then hearing a rustling again in the closet  I   said  Heaven protect us  but before I say my prayers  I must look into   this closet  And so was going to it slip shod  when  O dreadful  out   rushed my master in a rich silk and silver morning gown       I screamed  and ran to the bed  and Mrs  Jervis screamed too  and he   said  I ll do you no harm  if you forbear this noise  but otherwise take   what follows       Instantly he came to the bed  for I had crept into it  to Mrs  Jervis    with my coat on  and my shoes   and taking me in his arms  said  Mrs    Jervis  rise  and just step up stairs to keep the maids from coming down   at this noise  I ll do no harm to this rebel       O  for Heaven s sake  for pity s sake  Mrs  Jervis  said I  if I am not   betrayed  don t leave me  and
