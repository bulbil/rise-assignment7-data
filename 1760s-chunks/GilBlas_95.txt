to performers very unseasonably  Indeed  their boisterous tokens of approbation are more frequently bestowed on paltry copies than on original merit  as Phedrus teaches us by an ingenious fable  Allow me to repeat it as follows     The whole population of a city was assembled in a large square to see a pantomime played  Among the performers there was one whose feats were applauded every instant  This buffoon  at the end of the entertainment  wished to close the scene with a new device  He came alone upon the stage  stooping clown  covering his head with his mantle  and began counterfeiting the squeak of a pig  He acquitted himself so naturally as to be suspected of having the animal itself concealed within the folds of his drapery  He stripped  but there was no pig  The assembly rang with more furious applause than ever  A peasant  among the spectators  was disgusted at this misplaced admiration  Gentlemen  exclaimed he  you are in the wrong to be so delighted with this buffoon  he is not so good a mimic as you take him for  I can enact the pig better  if you doubt it  only attend here this time to morrow  The people  prejudiced in the cause of their favourite  collected in greater numbers on the next day  rather to hiss the countryman than to see what he could do  The rivals appeared on the stage  The buffoon began  and was more applauded than the day before  Then the farmer stooping down in his turn  with his head wrapped up in his cloak  pulled the ear of a real pig under his arm  and made it squeal most horribly  Yet this enlightened audience persisted in giving the preference to their favourite  and hooted the countryman off the boards  who producing the pig before he went  said    Gentlemen  you are not hissing me  but the original pig  So much for your judgment   Cousin  said Don Alexo  your fable is rather satirical  Nevertheless  in spite of your pig  we will not bate an inch of our opinion  But let us change the subject  this is grown threadbare  Then you set off to morrow  do what we can to keep you with us longer  I should like  answered his kinsman  to protract my stay with you  but it is not in my power  I have told you already that I am come to the court of Spain on an affair of state  Yesterday  on my arrival  I had a conference with the prime minister  I am to see him to morrow morning  and shall set out immediately afterwards on my return to Lisbon  You are become quite a Portuguese  observed Segiar  and  to all appearance  we shall lose you entirely from Madrid  I think otherwise  replied Don Pompeyo  I have the honour to stand well with the King of Portugal  and have many motives of attachment to that court  yet with all the kindness that sovereign has testified towards me  would you believe that I have been on the point of quitting his dominions for ever  Indeed  by what strange accident  said the Marquis  Give us the history  I beseech you  Very readily  answered Don Pompeyo  and at the same time my own  for it is closely interwoven with the recital for which you have called       CH  VII     History of Don Pompeyo de Castro   DON ALEXO knows  that from my boyish days  my passion was for a military life  Our own country being at peace  I went into Portugal  thence to Africa with the Duke of Braganza  who gave me a commission  I was a younger brother  with as slender a provision as most in Spain  so that my only chance was in attracting the notice of the commander in chief by my bravery  I was so far from deficient in my duty  that the Duke promoted me  step by step  to one of the most honourable posts in the service  After a long war  of which you all know the issue  I devoted myself to the court  and the King  on strong testimonials from the general officers  rewarded me with a considerable pension  Alive to that sovereign s generosity  I lost no opportunity of proving my gratitude by my diligence  I was in attendance as often as etiquette would allow me to offer myself to his notice  By this conduct I gained insensibly the love of that prince  and received new favours from his hands   One day  when I distinguished myself in running at the ring  and in a bull fight preceding it  all the court extolled my strength and dexterity  On my return home  with my honours thick upon me  I found there a note  informing me that a lady  my conquest over whom ought to flatter me more than all the glory I had gained that day  wished to have the pleasure of my company  and that I had only to attend in the evening  at a place marked out in the letter  This was more than all my public triumphs  and I concluded the writer to be a woman of the first quality  You may guess that I did
