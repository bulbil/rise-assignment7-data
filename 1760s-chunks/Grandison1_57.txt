to any assurance of this nature from me   None  madam —But from your goodness—Dear Miss Byron  condescend to say  that this Sir Hargrave shall not make any impression on your heart  For his sake say it  if not for mine  I know you care not what becomes of me  yet let not this milk faced  and tyger hearted fop  for that is his character  obtain favour from you  Let your choice  if it must fall on another man  and not on me  fall on one to whose superior merit  and to whose good fortune  I can subscribe  For your own fame s sake  let a man of unquestionable honour be the happy man  and vouchsafe as to a neighbour  and as to a well wishing friend    137 only  I ask it not in the light of a Lover  to tell me that Sir Hargrave Pollexfen shall not be the man   What  Mr  Greville  let me ask you  is your business in town   My chief business  madam  you may guess at  I had an hint of this man s intentions given me  and that he has the vanity to think he shall succeed  But if I can be assured  that you will not be prevailed upon in favour of a man whose fortune is so ample—  You will then return to Northamptonshire   Why  madam  I can t but say that now I am in town  and that I have bespoke a new equi  and so forth—  Nay  Sir  it is nothing to me  what you will or will not do  Only be pleased to remember  that as in Northamptonshire your visits were to my uncle Selby  not to me  they will be here in London  to my cousin Reeves s only   Too well do I know that you can be cruel if you will  But is it your pleasure that I return to the country   My pleasure  Sir  Mr  Greville is surely to do as he pleases  I only wish to be allowed the same liberty   You are so very delicate  Miss Byron  So very much afraid of giving the least advantage—  And men are so ready to take advantage—But yet  Mr  Greville  not so delicate as just  I do assure you  that if I were not determined—  Determined —Yes  yes  You can be steady  as Mr  Selby calls it  I never knew so determined a woman in my life  I own  it was a little inconvenient for me to come to town just now  And say  that you would wish me to leave London  and that neither this Sir Hargrave  nor that other man  your new father s nephew  What do you call him  Fore gad  madam  I am afraid of these new relations  shall make any impression on your heart  and that you will not   138 withdraw when I come here  and I will set out next week  and write this very night to let Fenwick know how matters stand  and that I am coming down but little the better for my journey  And this may save you seeing your other tormentor  as your cousin Lucy says you once called that poor devil  and the still poorer devil before you   You are so rash a man  Mr  Greville  and other men may be as rash as you  that I cannot say but it would save me some pain—  O take care  take care  Miss Byron  that you express yourself so cautiously  as to give no advantage to a poor dog  who would be glad to take a journey to the farthest part of the globe to oblige you  But what say you about this Sir Hargrave  and about your new brother —Let me tell you  madam  I am so much afraid of those whining  insinuating  creeping dogs  attacking you on the side of your compassion  and be d—n d to them  Orme for that  that I must have a declaration  And now  madam  can t you give it with your usual caution  Can t you give it  as I put it  as to a neighbour  as to a well wisher  and so forth  not as to a Lover   Well then  Mr  Greville  as a neighbour  as a wellwisher  and since you own it was inconvenient to your affairs to come up—I advise you to go down again   The devil  how you have hit it  Your delicacy ought to thank me for the loope hole  The condition  madam  The condition  if I take your neighbourly advice   Why  Mr  Greville  I do most sincerely declare to you  as to a neighbour and well wisher  that I never  yet  have seen the man to whom I can think of giving my hand   Yes  you have  By heaven you have  snatching my hand   You shall give it to me —And the strange wretch pressed it so hard to his mouth  that he made prints upon it with his teeth     139 Oh  cried I  withdrawing my hand  surprized  and my face  as
