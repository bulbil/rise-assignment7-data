what there could be to be vain of in such an associa    tion   but you do not reflect that vanity is never the result of real   worth  The false glare of public estimation reflects it from the   vilest and most reproachful objects  The institutor of this society   was admired for every polite accomplishment  every power of   pleasing in conversation   and the first set he chose were all of the   same cast  This  with their rank and fortunes  and  above all  the   mystery of the institution  which set curiosity on fire  and gave   imagination room to form the most flattering ideas of it  made   admission into it an object of universal ambition  as it seemed a   proof of every member s meriting the same character   and when   once admitted  a vicious fear of ridicule made too many ashamed   to quit it   and even they who did  were precluded from discovering   anything that might deter others  by the secrecy to which they   were sworn      There is one thing more which  from the particular circumstances   of your own life  affects you more than any other in this account    This is the folly and ingratitude of lavishing the blessing of wealth   to the dishonour of the Donor  and with so little regard to its real   use  But this  as has been the case in other instances  proceeds   from want of better acquaintance with life      It has been remarked by travellers  that in those parts of the   earth  where the blessings of nature are bestowed with the greatest   liberality  the people seem least sensible of them  and are sunk in   the grossest vice  as if reason and virtue were incompatible with the   good  things of this world  The reason of this remark holds with   respect to wealth in other countries  Provided to profusion with         394 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     everything they want  the rich look no further than to the gratifica    tion of their appetites and paasions  as the means to procure which   are in their possession  they acknowledge no obligation to the Power   which first gave  and still preserves the enjoyment of them   but    on the contrary  affect to show their independence  by prostituting   it to purposes directly contrary to His declared pleasure  and this   causes that abuse of wealth  which generally mars the blessing    and makes the gift of it so dangerous          CHAPTER XXIII     ACCOUNT OP THE MEMBERS OP THE SOCIETY â€” THE HISTOSY OP THE   STJPERIOE â€” THE PABTICtTLAB  QUALIFICATIONS BY WHICH HE   AEOSE IN LIPB â€” SUCCESS IN  A PRIVATE INSTANCE ENCOURAGES   HIM TO TRY HIS TALENTS IN A HIGHER SPHERE  FROM WHICH HE   SOON DESCENDS WITH DISGRACE â€” A STRIKING INCONSISTENCY   OP HIS CHARACTER     I SEE you desire to have some account of the several members of   so extraordinary a society  When the great lines which distinguish   the characters of mankind are marked by virtues  or even by superior   abilities that dazzle superficial observation by the splendour of   their effects  and pass for such  however different in the tendency   of their exertions  the delineation affords pleasure   but  on the   contrary  where those lines are all distorted by vice and folly  and   distinguished from each other only by different modes and degrees   of them  the contemplation is a pain  and to paint them a task so   disagreeable  that nothing but an impartial regard to truth could   make it be undertaken  However  your curiosity shall be gratified    As the convent was dedicated to pleasure  you may imagine that   play was made a part of their entertainment  Contrary  indeed    to the scheme of all other parties of pleasure  it was not the first   object of their meeting  and only served to fill up the intervals   between other pleasures  which nature  without some respite  could   not support in such excess  The circulation  however  even in this   piddling for mere amusement  gave me an opportunity of taking a   view of all their characters  such of which as contained anything   worthy of your notice  for you must not expect it from them all    I will give you some general sketches of  As the looks of a man are   generally a comment on his heart  I will place the whole company   in youx view  as I have done on other occasions  to assist you in   forming a proper notion of their characters  At the head of the   table sits the superior   You see every eye is expressively fixed   upon him in admiration  at the vivacity  humour  and wit in
