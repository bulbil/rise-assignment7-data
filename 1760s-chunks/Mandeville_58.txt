knew the horrors of being in debt  you can form no idea of what it is to breathe the air at the mercy of another  to labor  to struggle to be just  whilst the cruel world are loading you with the guilt of injustice            2 60          I entered the house  filled with horrors not to be conceived  My wife met me with eager enquiries about our future residence  and with repeated thanks to that God who had thus graciously bestowed on us the means of doing justice to all the world  You will imagine what I felt at that moment  instead of replying  I related to her the treatment I had met with  and the character of him to whom we were to be obliged  and asked her  what she would wish me to do  Resign the living  said she  and trust to that Heaven whose goodness is over all his creatures  I embraced her with tears of tender transport  and told her I had already done it  We wrote to the Lady to whose friendship we had been obliged for the presentation  and she had the greatness of mind not to disapprove my conduct  We have since practised a more severe frugality  which we are determined not to relax till what we owe is fully discharged  time will  we hope  bring about this end  and remove          2 61       the load which now oppresses my heart  Determined to trust to Heaven and our own industry  and to aim at independence alone  I have avoided all acquaintance which could interfere with this only rational plan  but Lord T      seeing me at the house of a nobleman whose virtues do honour to his rank  and imagining my fortune easy from my cordial reception there  invited me earnestly to his seat  where  having  as I suppose  been since undeceived as to my situation  you were a witness of his unworthy treatment of me  of one descended from a family noble as his own  liberally educated  with a spirit equally above meanness and pride  and a heart which feels too sensibly to be happy in a world like this      Oh  Mr  Mandeville  What can you think of him  who  instead of pouring out his soul in thankfulness to Heaven for those advantages he enjoys by his goodness above his fellow creatures  makes use of them to          2 62       would the bosom of the wretched  and add double bitterness to the cup of adversity      The real evils of a narrow fortune are trifling  its worst pangs spring from the unfeeling cruelty of others  it is not always that philosophy can raise us above the proud man s contumely  or those thousand insults       Which patient merit of th  unworthy takes       You  Mr  Mandeville  are young  and full of probity  your own heart will mislead you  by drawing too flattering a picture of others  the world is gay before you  and  blinded by prosperity  you have never yet seen it as it is  I have heard you with infinite concern hint designs too like my own  let me intreat  let me conjure you  to profit by my example  if peace is worth your care  be content with your paternal fortune  however small  nor  by          2 63       rashly launching on the flattering sea of hope  hazard that shipwreck which I have suffered       Mordaunt  Is not this the voice of Heaven  I will return to the bosom of independence  and give up designs in which it is almost impossible for modest worth to succeed        My father is in town  I will go to him when he returns  his advice shall determine my future conduct        A letter from Lady Julia  my servant has this moment brought it from Lord T     s  whither I desired it to be directed   not chusing to let them know I have put an end to my visit  lest Lord Belmont should insist on my return            2 64         To Henry Mandeville  Esq      IN what words shall I assure the most amiable of men he has nothing to fear from Lord Melvin  If he knows my heart  he knows it incapable of change  he knows  not his own generous spirit more disdains the low consideration of fortune  he knows  I can have but one wish  that this accidental advantage was on his side  that he might taste the transport of obliging her he loves        My duty  my gratitude to the best of parents  forbids my entering into present engagements without his knowledge  nor will I make future ones  which would have in view an event
