find wherewithal to corroborate certain hints which have been communicated to us respecting you   The son of commerce  aghast at these sounds of melancholy import  reeled two steps backward  just as if some one had given him a blow in the breadbasket  Far from smelling a rat in this pleasant trick of ours  he fancied in good earnest that some secret enemy had made him an object of suspicion to the holy hue and cry  and it might possibly have happened that  from being rather clumsy at his new duties as a Christian  he might be conscious of having laid himself open to serious animadversion  However that might be  I never saw a man look more foolish  He did as he was ordered without saying nay  and opened all his lock up places with the sheepish acquiescence of a man  who stood in awe of an ecclesiastical rap on the knuckles  At least  said Ambrose as he went in  at least you are not a contumacious oppugner of our resistless mandates  But withdraw into another room  and leave me to fulfil the duties of my station without profane observers  Samuel did not set his face against this command any more than against the first  but kept himself quiet in his shop  while we went all three of us into his closet  where  without loss of time  we laid an embargo on his cash  It was no difficult matter to find it  for it lay in an open coffer  and in much larger quantity than we could carry away  There were a great many bags heaped up  but all in silver  Gold would have been more to our mind  but  as robbers must not be choosers any more than beggars  we were obliged to yield to the necessity of the case  Not only did we line our pockets with ducats  but the most unsearchable parts of our dress were made the receptacles of our filchings  Yet was there no outward shew of the heavy burden under which we tottered  thanks to the cunning contrivance of Ambrose and Don Raphael  who proved that there is nothing like being master of one s trade   We marched out of the closet  after having feathered our nests pretty warmly  and then  for a reason which the reader will have no great difficulty in guessing  the worshipful inquisitor produced his padlock  and fixed it on the door with his own hands  he affixed moreover his own seal  and then said to Simon  Master Samuel  I forbid you  in the name of the holy inquisition  to touch either this padlock or this seal  which it is your bounden duty to hold sacred  since it is the authentic seal of our holy office  I shall return hither this time to morrow  then and here to open my commission  and provisionally to take off the interdict  With this injunction  he ordered the street door to he opened  and we made our escape after the processional manner  out of our wits with joy  As soon as we had marched about fifty yards  we began to mend our pace into such a quick step  aggravated by degrees into a leap and a bound  that we were almost like vaulters and tumblers  in spite of the weight we carried  We were soon out of town  and mounting our horses once more  pushed forward towards Segorba  with many a pious ejaculation to the God Mercury  on the happy issue of so bold an attempt       CH  II    The determination of Don Alphonso and Gil Blas after this adventure   We travelled all night  according to our modest and unobtrusive custom  so that we found ourselves at sunrise near a little village two leagues from Segorba  As we were all tired to death  it was agreed unanimously to strike out of the highway  and rest under the shade of some willows  which we saw at the foot of a little hill  about ten or twelve hundred yards from the village  where it did not seem expedient for us to halt  These willows furnished us with an agreeable retreat  by the side of a little brook which bubbled as it washed their roots  The place struck our fancy  and we resolved to pass the day there  We unbridled our horses  and turned them out to grass  stretching our own gentle limbs on the soft sod  There we courted the drowsy god of innocent repose for a while  and then rummaged to the bottom of our wallet and our wine skin  After an ecclesiastical breakfast  we counted up our ten tithes of Samuel Simon s money  and it mounted to a round three thousand ducats  So that with such a sum and what we had before  it might be said  without boasting  that we knew how to make both ends meet   As it was necessary to go to market  Ambrose and Don Raphael  throwing off their dresses now the play was over  said that they would take that office conjointly on themselves  the adventure at Xelva had only sharpened their wit  and they had a mind to look about Segorba  just to make the experiment whether any opportunity might offer of striking another stroke  You have no thing to do  added the heir of Lucinda s wit and wisdom
