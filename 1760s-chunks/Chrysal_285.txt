my life  No  no   they must be cunning   if they can make an oath that will stick in the throat of the captain   of a merchantman  even if he can t find an opening to steer through    as was the case here  We have a salvo for such things  The first   oath we take  as soon as we get into employment is  never to swear   the truth to a custom house officer while we live  so that all the oaths   they give us go for nothing        But with all this cleverness  he sometimes failed of success  A   lieutenant of a man of war happening  as he was rowing guard   one night  to see Â«  boat put off from our ship  pursued it  as he   knew it must be a smuggler  The crew  observing the lieutenant s         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 33S      boat gain fast upon them  and knowing it was impossible to escape    threw their cargo overboard  and ran the boat ashore  to save   themselves from being taken  leaving her to the captors  who towed   her away in triumph      The chief of the smugglers was my master s son  who  in the ac    count he gave him of the affair on his return  was proceeding to   tell him the names of those that were with him  but the father    stopping him  cried    Avast   coil up your tongue   I desire to hear   no more of them  Have you a mind to make me forswear myself   when I go to recover my boat   for have her again you know I   must  as I cannot get another here  nor carry on any business   without one        Accordingly  next morning he made public inquiry after his boat    which he pretended had been stolen from his ship s side  and finding   her in the possession of the lieutenant  demanded to have her   restored directly  and  on his refusal  had him summoned before   the officers of the customs  who were judges in such affairs  As he   grounded his claim on her having been taken away without ids   privity  and by persons unknown to him  he was put to the common   test of an oath  whether he knew who was in her when she was    pursued by the captors        By the virtue of my oath  gentlemen    answered he  without the   least hesitation    I do not know one of them        So direct an answer satisfied the judges  who were noways con    cerned in the afiair  but that was not the case with the lieutenant        Hold  sir    said he to my master  who was sheering off  laughing   in his sleeve    What is that you say           I say    answered my master  nothing disconcerted    that I don t   know one of them          One of them     returned the lieutenant  who instantly saw   through the evasion    But do you know any of them   Take   care what you say  Perhaps I know more than you think I do          Why  as to that    replied my master  laughing    I cannot say   80 much  Perhaps I may know some of them          How     interposed the judge  offended at an answer which he   thought showed a alight of his authority    Did not you swear this   moment that you did not know one of them           Nor do I    answered my master    There were twelve in the   boat  of whom I know only eleven  and sure  in that case  I can safely   swear I do not know one  that is  the twelfth of them  Ha   ha   ha   1       Take care  sir    replied the judge    how you trifie before ua   again  You know the punishment of perjury if you should be   caught tripping          Never fear    said my master    I know the compass of my con    science too well for that  Thus  thus  and no nearer  is my trim    I ll never break an oath   but if I can give it the go by at the leeside   thus by
