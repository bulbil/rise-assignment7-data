with a worsted night cap  buttoned under his chin  and a broad brimmed hat slouched over it  an old rusty blue cloak tied about his neck  under which appeared a brown surtout  that covered a threadbare coat and waste coat  and  as we afterwards discerned  a dirty flannel jacket —His eyes were hollow  bleared and gummy  his face was shrivelled into a thousand wrinkles  his gums were destitute of teeth  his nose sharp and drooping  his chin peeked and prominent  so that when he mumped or spoke  they approached one another like a pair of nut crackers  he supported himself on an ivory headed cane  and his whole figure was a just emblem of winter  famine and avarice —But how was I surprized  when I beheld the formidable captain leading in his wife  in the shape of a little  thin creature  about the age of forty  with a long  withered visage  very much resembling that of a baboon  through the upper part of which  two little grey eyes peeped  He wore his own hair in a queue that reached to his rump  which immoderate length  I suppose  was the occasion of a baldness that appeared on the crown of his head  when he deigned to take off his hat  which was very much of the size and cock of Pistol s —Having laid aside his great coat  I could not help admiring the extraordinary make of this man of war  He was about five foot and three inches high  sixteen inches of   78 which went to his face and long scraggy neck  his thighs were about six inches in length  his legs resembling spindles or drum sticks  two feet and an half  and his body  which put me in mind of extension without substance  engrossed the remainder —so that on the whole  he appeared like a spider or grashopper erect —and was almost a vox   preterca nihil —His dress consisted in a frock of what is called bear skin  the skirts of which were about half a foot long  an Hussar waistcoat  scarlet breeches reaching half way down his thigh  worsted stockings rolled up almost to his groin  and shoes with wooden heels at least two inches high  he carried a sword very near as long as himself in one hand  and in the other conducted his lady  who seemed to be a woman of his own age  and still retained some remains of an agreeable person  but so ridiculously affected  that had I then known as much of the world as I do now  I might have easily perceived in her  the deplorable vanity and second hand airs of a lady s woman —We were all assembled in the kitchen  when captain Weazel  for that was his name  desired a room with a fire for himself and spouse  and told the landlord  they would sup by themselves —The inn keeper replied  that he could not afford them a room by themselves  and as for supping  he had prepared victuals for the passengers in the waggon without respect of persons  but if he could prevail on the rest to let him have his choice in a separate manner  with all his heart  This was no sooner said  than all of us declared against the proposal  and miss Jenny  our other female passenger  observed  that if captain Weazel and his lady had a mind to sup by themselves  they might   79 wait until we should have done —At this  the captain put on a martial frown and looked very big  without speaking  while his yoke fellow  with a disdainful toss of her nose  muttered something about   Creature  —  which miss Jenny over hearing  stept up to her  saying    None of your names  good Mrs  Abigail —creature quotha —I ll assure you —No such creature as you neither—no ten pound sneaker—no quality coupler  —  Here the captain interposed with a   Damme  madam  what d ye mean by that  —   Damn you  sir  who are you   replied miss Jenny  who made you a captain  you pitiful  trencher scraping  pimping curler — Sdeath  the army is come to a fine pass  when such fellows as you get commissions —What  I suppose you think I don t know you —By G—d  you and your helpmate are well met —a cast off mistress  and a bald valet de chambre are well yoked together  Blood and wounds   cried Weazel  d ye question the honour of my wife  madam —Hell and damnation  No man in England durst say so much —I would flea him  carbonado him  Fury and destruction  I would have his liver for my supper  —  So saying  he drew his sword  and flourished with it  to the great terror of Strap  while miss Jenny snapping her fingers  told him  she did not value his resentment a f—t —In the midst of this quarrel  the master of the waggon alighted  who understanding the cause of it  and fearing the captain and his lady would take so much umbrage  as to leave his carriage  was at great pains to have every thing made up  which he at last accomplished  and we sat down to supper all together
