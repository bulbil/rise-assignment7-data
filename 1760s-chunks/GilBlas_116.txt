you as my father  I shall make it my glory to be governed by your counsels  and you shall reign in Sicily with a sway paramount to my own  With these words  advancing to the standish and taking a blank sheet of paper  he wrote his name at the bottom  What are you doing  sir  said Siffredi  Proving my gratitude and my esteem  answered Enriquez  Then the prince presented the paper to Blanche  and said    Accept  madam  this pledge of my faith  and of the empire with which I invest you over my thoughts and actions  Blanche received it with a blush  and made this answer to the prince    I acknowledge with all humility the condescensions of my sovereign  but my destiny is in the hands of a father  and you must not consider me as ungrateful if I deposit this flattering token in his custody  to be used according to the dictates of his sage discretion   In compliance with these sentiments of filial duty  she gave the sign manual of Enriquez to her father  Then Siffredi saw at once what till that moment had eluded his penetration  He entered dearly into the prince s sentiments  and said  Your majesty shall have no reproaches to make me  I shall not act unworthily of the confidence         My dear Leontio  interrupted Enriquez  you and unworthiness never can be allied  Make what use you please of my signature  I shall confirm your determination  But go  return to Palermo  prescribe the ceremonies for my coronation there  and tell my subjects that I shall follow you in person immediately  to receive their oaths of allegiance  and assure them of my protection in return  The minister obeyed the commands of his new master  and set out for Palermo with his daughter   Some hours after their departure  the prince also left Belmonte  with his thoughts more intent on his passion than on the high rank to which he was called  Immediately on his arrival in the city  the air was rent with a thousand cries of joy  He made his entry into the palace amid the acclamations of the people  and everything was ready for the august formalities  The Princess Constance was waiting to receive him  in a magnificent mourning dress  She appeared deeply affected by Roger s death  The customs of society required from them a reciprocal compliment of condolence on the late event  and they each of them acquitted themselves with good breeding and propriety  But there was somewhat more coldness on the part of Enriquez than on that of Constance  who could not enter into family quarrels  and resolved on hating the young prince  He placed himself on the throne  and the princess sate beside him  in a chair of state a little less elevated  The great officers of the realm fell into their places  each according to his rank  The ceremony began  and Leontio  as lord high chancellor of the kingdom  holding in his possession the will of the late king  opened it  and read the contents aloud  This instrument contained in substance that Roger  in default of issue  nominated the eldest son of Mainfroi his successor  on condition of his marrying the Princess Constance  and in the event of his refusing her hand  the crown of Sicily was to devolve  to his exclusion  on the head of the infant Don Pedro  his brother  on the like condition   These words were a thunderstroke to Enriquez  His senses were all bewildered even to distraction  and his agonies became still more acute  when Leontio  having finished the reading of the will  addressed the assembly at large to the following effect  My lords  the last injunctions of the late king having been made known to our new monarch  that pious and excellent prince consents to honour his cousin the Princess Constance with his hand  At these words Enriquez interrupted the chancellor  Leontio  said he  remember the writing  Blanche        Sire  interrupted Siffredi in his turn with precipitation  lest the prince should find an opportunity of making himself understood  here it is  The nobility of the kingdom  added he  exhibiting the blank paper to the assembly  will see by your majesty s august subscription  the esteem in which you hold the princess  and your implicit deference to the last will of the late king your uncle   Having finished these words  he forthwith began reading the instrument in such terms as he had himself inserted  According to the contents  the new king gave a promise to his people  with formalities the most binding and authentic  that he would marry Constance  in conformity with the intention of Roger  The hall re echoed with pealing shouts of satisfaction  Long live our high and mighty King Enriquez  exclaimed all those who were present  As the marked aversion of the prince for the princess had never been any secret  it was apprehended  not without reason  that he might revolt against the condition of the will  and light up the flame of civil discord in the kingdom  but the public enunciation of this solemn act  quieting the fears of the nobility and the people on that head  excited these universal applauses  which
