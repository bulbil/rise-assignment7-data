was there  The knocking continued with greater violence than it began    and Miss Betsy heard the gentlemen s voices talking to the servant  and    though she could not distinguish what they said  found there were very   high words between them  My lord s sister ran into the hall to listen    then came back  crying   O what terrible oaths   I am afraid they will   break open the door     No   replied Lord        it is too strong for   that  but I wish we had been so wise as to send for a constable   One of   the servants came down  and repeated what their young lady had said    adding  that the gentlemen swore they would not leave the place till   they had spoke with the lady  who they said had been trepanned into that   house  On this   Suppose  my lord   said Miss Betsy   I go to the door   and tell them that I will not go with them     No  Madam   answered Lord          I cannot consent my door should be opened to such ruffians    besides that they would certainly seize and carry you off by force  I   know not what mischief they might do my poor men  for having at first   refused them entrance   She then said she would go up to the window  and   answer them from thence  but he would not suffer her to be seen by them   at all  and  to keep her from insisting on it  told her a great many   stories of rapes  and other mischiefs  that had been perpetrated by   Bloomacre  and those he kept company with       All this did not give Miss Betsy those terrors  which  it is very plain   his lordship and sister endeavoured to inspire her with  yet would she   say no more of appearing to the gentlemen  as she found he was so averse   to it       At length the knocking ceased  and one of the footmen came down  and   said that those who had given his lordship this disturbance had   withdrawn from the door  and he believed they were gone quite out of the   cloisters  but this intelligence did not satisfy Lord       he either   was  or pretended to be  in fear that they were still skulking in some   corner  and would rush in if once they saw the door opened  There was   still the same difficulty as ever  how Miss Betsy should get home  that   is  how she should get safely out of the house  for  the rain being   over  the servants said they did not doubt but they should be able to   procure a chair or coach  after much debating on this matter  it was   thus contrived       Lord      had a window that looked into the yard of one of the   prebendaries  a footman was to go out of the window to the back door of   that reverend divine  relate the whole story  and beg leave to go   through his house  that request being granted  the footman went  and   returned in less than half an hour  with the welcome news that a chair   was ready  and waited in College Street  Miss Betsy had no way of   passing  but by the same the footman had done  which she easily did  by   being lifted by my lord into the window  and descending from it by the   help of some steps placed on the other side by the servants of the   prebendary       It would be superfluous to trouble the reader with any speeches made by   Lord       and his sister  to Miss Betsy  or the replies she made to   them  I shall only say  that passing through his house  and the College   Garden  at the door of which the chair waited  she went into it    preceded by Lord      s footman  muffled up in a cloak  and without a   flambeau  to prevent being known  in case she should be met by   Bloomacre  or either of his companions  and with this equipage she   arrived safe at home  though not without a mind strangely perplexed at   the meaning of this adventure                CHAPTER XXI       Gives an explanation of the former  with other particulars  more   agreeable to the reader in the repetition  than to the persons concerned   in them          It was near ten o clock when Miss Betsy came home  and Mr  Goodman  who
