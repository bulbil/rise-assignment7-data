punishment  to which he was doomed  and having signified his sentiments to his  confederates  they promised one and all to stand by him  and either  screen him from chastisement or share his fate   Confiding in this friendly protestation  he appeared unconcerned on the  day that was appointed for his punishment  and when he was called to  his destiny  advanced the scene  attended by the greatest part of the    6 22 15  3 45 PM   scholars  who intimated their determination to the master  and proposed  that Peregrine should be forgiven  The superior behaved with that  dignity of demeanour which became his place  represented the folly  and presumption of their demand  reprehended them for their audacious  proceeding  and ordered every boy to his respective station  They obeyed  his command  and our unfortunate hero was publicly horsed  in terrorem  of all whom it might concern   This disgrace had a very sensible effect upon the mind of Peregrine   who  having by this time  passed the fourteenth year of his age   began to adopt the pride and sentiments of a man  Thus dishonourably  stigmatized  he was ashamed to appear in public as usual  he was  incensed against his companions for their infidelity and irresolution   and plunged into a profound reverie that lasted several weeks  during  which he shook off his boyish connections  and fixed his view upon  objects which he thought more worthy of his attention   In the course of his gymnastic exercises  at which he was very expert   he contracted intimacies with several youths who were greatly his  superiors in point of age  and who  pleased with his aspiring genius  and address  introduced him into parties of gallantry which strongly  captivated his inclination  He was by nature particularly adopted  for succeeding in all adventures of this kind  over and above a most  engaging person that improved with his years  he possessed a dignified  assurance  an agreeable ferocity which enhanced the conquest of the fair  who had the good fortune to enslave him  unlimited generosity  and a  fund of humour which never failed to please  Nor was he deficient in  the more solid accomplishments of youth  he had profited in his studies  beyond expectation  and besides that sensibility of discernment which  is the foundation of taste  and in consequence of which he distinguished  and enjoyed the beauties of the classics  he had already given several  specimens of a very promising poetic talent   With this complexion and these qualifications  no wonder that our hero  attracted the notice and affections of the young Delias in town  whose  hearts had just begun to flutter for they knew not what  Inquiries  were made concerning his condition  and no sooner were his expectations  known  than he was invited and caressed by all the parents  while  the daughters vied with each other in treating him with particular  complacency  He inspired love and emulation wherever he appeared  envy  and jealous rage followed of course  so that he became a very desirable   though a very dangerous acquaintance  His moderation was not equal to  his success  his vanity took the lead of his passions  dissipating his  attention  which might otherwise have fixed him to one object  and he  was possessed with the rage of increasing the number of his conquests   With this view he frequented public walks  concerts  and assemblies   became remarkably rich and fashionable in his clothes  gave  entertainments to the ladies  and was in the utmost hazard of turning  out a most egregious coxcomb   While his character thus wavered between the ridicule of some and the  regard of others  an accident happened which by contracting his view  to one object  detached him from those vain pursuits that would in time  have plunged him into an abyss of folly and contempt  Being one evening  at the ball which is always given to the ladies at the time of the  races  the person acted as master of the ceremonies  knowing how fond  Mr  Pickle was of every opportunity to display himself  came up  and    6 22 15  3 45 PM   told him  that there was a fine young creature at the other end of the  room  who seemed to have a great inclination to dance a minuet  but  wanted a partner  the gentleman who attended her being in boots   Peregrine s vanity being aroused at this intimation  he went up to  reconnoitre the young lady  and was struck with admiration at her  beauty  She seemed to be of his own age  was tall  though slender   exquisitely shaped  her hair was auburn  and in such plenty  that the  barbarity of dress had not been able to prevent it from shading both  sides of her forehead  which was high and polished  the contour of her  face was oval  her nose very little raised into the aquiline form   that contributed to the spirit and dignity of her aspect  her mouth was  small  her lips plump  juicy  and delicious  her teeth regular and white  as driven snow
