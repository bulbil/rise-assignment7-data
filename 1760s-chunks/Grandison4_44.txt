it  when they live single till the age of fancy is over  Those who marry while it lasts  are often disappointed of that which they propose so largely to themselves  While those who wed for convenience  and deal with tolerable honesty by each other  are at a greater certainty  Tolerable  I repeat  since  it seems  we are not to expect that both parties will turn the best side of the old garment outward  Hence arises consolation to old maidens  and cautions against precipitation—Expatiate  my dear  on this fruitful subject  I would  were I at leisure   Sir Charles says  that he doubts not  but Lord W  will be as happy a man as he wishes to be  in less than a month   The duce is in this brother of mine  whispered Miss Grandison  to me  for huddling up of marriages  He don t consider  that ther••ay be two chances for one  〈◊◊〉 honest 〈◊〉•n half a year s time  bles•••〈◊◊〉 conti•••••   Sir Charles told us  that he had desired Lord W    110 to give out every where  that the adversaries of the Mansfield family might know it  his intended alliance  and that he and his nephew were both determined to procure a retrospection of all former proceedings   Sir Charles got to Sir Harry Beauchamp s a little before his friend arrived  Sir Harry took him aside at his alighting  and told him  that Lady Beauchamp had had clouds on her brow all the day  and he was afraid  would not receive his son with the graciousness that once he hoped for from her  But that he left him to manage with her  She never  said he  had so high an opinion either of man or woman as she has of you   Sir Charles addressed himself to her  as not doubting her goodness upon the foot of their former conversation  and praised her for the graces that however appeared but faintly in her countenance  till his compliments lighted them up  and made them shine full out in it  He told her  that his sister and Lord G  were to be married on the following Tuesday  He himself  he said  should set out for Paris on Friday after  but hoped to see a family intimacy begun between his sisters and Lady Beauchamp  and between their Lords  and Sir Harry  and Mr  Beauchamp  He applauded her on the generosity of her intentions  as declared to him in their former conference  and congratulated her on the power she had  of which she made so noble an use  of laying  at the same time  an obligation on the tenderest of husbands  and the most deserving of sons  Whose duty to her he engaged for   All this set her in high good humour  and she took to herself  and bridled upon it  to express myself in Charlotte s manner  the praises and graces this adroit manager gave her  as if they were her unquestionable due   This agreeable way they were all in  Sir Harry   111 transported with his Lady s goodness  when Mr  Beauchamp arrived   The young gentleman bent his knee to his stepmother  as well as to his father  and thanked her for the high favours his father had signified to him by Letter  that he owed to her goodness  She confirmed them  but  Sir Charles observed  with an ostentation that shewed she thought very highly of her own generosity   They had a very chearful evening  Not one could would hang on Lady Beauchamp s brow  tho  once or twice it seemed a little overshadowed  as Mr  Beauchamp displayed qualities for which his father was too ready to admire him  Sir Charles thought it necessary to caution Sir Harry on this subject  putting it in this light  that Lady Beauchamp loved her husband so well  that she would be too likely to dread a rivalry in his affections from a son so very accomplished  Sir Harry took the hint kindly   Mr  Beauchamp was under a good deal of concern at Sir Charles s engagements to leave England so soon after his arrival  and asked his father s leave to attend him  Sir Harry declared  that he could not part with him  Sir Charles chid his friend  and said  It was not quite so handsome a return to the joyful reception he had met with from Lady Beauchamp  and his father  as might have been expected from his Beauchamp  bowing to the Lady  But she excused the young gentleman  and said  she wondered not  that any body who was favoured with his friendship  should be unwilling to be separated from him   Sir Charles expresses great satisfaction in Mr  Beauchamp s being arrived before his departure  that he may present to us  himself  a man with whom he is sure we shall all be delighted  and leave him happy in that beloved society  which he himself is obliged to quit   A repining temper  Lucy  would consider only the   112 hardship of meeting a long absent friend  just to feel the uneasiness of a second parting  But this man views every thing in a right light  When his own happiness is not to be attained
