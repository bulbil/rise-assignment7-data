  replied the chairman   is too  subtle to be perceived    A third mouth was just open  when the exercise was suddenly interrupted  by the dreadful cry of  Fire   which issued from the kitchen  and  involved the whole college in confusion  Every man endeavoured to be  the first in making his exit  the door and passage were blocked up  each  individual was pommelled by the person that happened to be behind him   This communication produced noise and exclamation  clouds of smoke  rolled upwards into the apartment  and terror sat on every brow  when  Peregrine  seeing no prospect of retreating by the door  opened one of  the windows  and fairly leaped into the street  where he found a crowd  of people assembled to contribute their assistance in extinguishing the  flames  Several members of the college followed his example  and happily  accomplished their escape  The chairman himself  being unwilling to use  the same expedient  stood trembling on the brink of descent  dubious  of his own agility  and dreading the consequence of such a leap  when  a chair happening to pass  he laid hold on the opportunity  and by an  exertion of his muscles  pitched upon the top of the carriage  which was  immediately overturned in the kennel  to the grievous annoyance of the  fare  which happened to be a certain effeminate beau  in full dress  on  his way to a private assembly   This phantom hearing the noise overhead  and feeling the shock of being  overthrown at the same time  thought that some whole tenement had fallen  upon the chair  and  in the terror of being crushed to pieces  uttered  a scream  which the populace supposed to proceed from the mouth of a  woman  and therefore went to his assistance  while the chairmen  instead  of ministering to his occasions  no sooner recollected themselves   than they ran in pursuit of their overthrower  who  being accustomed  to escape from bailiffs  dived into a dark alley  and  vanishing in a  trice  was not visible to any living soul  until he appeared next day on  Tower hill     6 22 15  3 45 PM   The humane part of the mob  who bestirred themselves for the relief of  the supposed lady  no sooner perceived their mistake in the appearance  of the beau  who stared around him with horror and affright  than their  compassion was changed into mirth  and they began to pass a great  many unsavoury jokes upon his misfortune  which they now discovered no  inclination to alleviate  and he found himself very uncomfortably  beset  when Pickle  pitying his situation  interposed in his behalf  and  prevailed upon the chairmen to carry him into the house of an apothecary  in the neighbourhood  to whom his mischance proved a very advantageous  accident  for the fright operated so violently upon his nerves  that he  was seized with a delirium  and lay a whole fortnight deprived of his  senses  during which period he was not neglected in point of medicines   food  and attendance  but royally regaled  as appeared by the contents  of his landlord s bill   Our adventurer having seen this unfortunate beau safely housed  returned  to the scene of the other calamity  which  as it was no other than a  foul chimney  soon yielded to the endeavours of the family  and was  happily overcome  without any other bad consequence than that of  alarming the neighbours  disturbing the college  and disordering  the brain of a beau  Eager to be acquainted with the particular  constitutions of a society which seemed to open upon him by degrees   Mr  Pickle did not fail to appear at the next meeting  when several  petitions were laid before the board  in behalf of those members who  were confined in the prisons of the Fleet  Marshalsea  and King s Bench   As those unhappy authors expected nothing from their brethren but advice  and good offices  which did not concern the purse  the memorials were  considered with great care and humanity  and  upon this occasion   Peregrine had it in his power to manifest his importance to the  community  for he happened to be acquainted with the creditor of one  of the prisoners  and knew that gentleman s severity was owing to his  resentment at the behaviour of the debtor  who had lampooned him in  print  because he refused to comply with a fresh demand  after he had  lent him money to the amount of a considerable sum  Our young gentleman   therefore  understanding that the author was penitent  and disposed to  make a reasonable submission  promised to employ his influence with the  creditor towards an accommodation  and in a few days actually obtained  his release   The social duties being discharged  the conversation took a general  turn  and several new productions were freely criticised  those  especially which belonged to authors who were either unconnected with   or unknown to the college  Nor did the profession of stage playing  escape the cognizance of the
