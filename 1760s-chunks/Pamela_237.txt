well provided   we may be for their reception  you shew no flutter or discomposure  That   whoever you may have in your company at the time  you signify not    by the least reserved look  that the stranger is come upon you   unseasonably  or at a time you wished he had not  But be facetious    kind  obliging to all  and  if to one more than another  to such as have   the least reason to expect it from you  or who are most inferior at the   table  for thus will you  my Pamela  cheer the doubting mind  quiet the   uneasy heart  and diffuse ease  pleasure  and tranquillity  around my   board       And be sure  my dear  continued he  let no little accidents ruffle your   temper  I shall never forget once that I was at Lady Arthur s  and a   footman happened to stumble  and let fall a fine china dish  and broke   it all to pieces  It was grievous to see the uneasiness it gave the poor   lady  And she was so sincere in it  that she suffered it to spread all   over the company  and it was a pretty large one too  and not a person   in it but turned either her consoler  or fell into stories of the like   misfortunes  and so we all became  for the rest of the evening  nothing   but blundering footmen  and careless servants  or were turned   into broken jars  plates  glasses  tea cups  and such like brittle   substances  And it affected me so much  that  when I came home  I went   to bed  and dreamt  that Robin  with the handle of his whip  broke the   fore glass of my chariot  and I was so solicitous  methought  to keep   the good lady in countenance for her anger  that I broke his head in   revenge  and stabbed one of my coach horses  And all the comfort I had   when it was done  methought  was  that I had not exposed myself before   company  and there were no sufferers  but guilty Robin  and one innocent   coach horse       I was exceedingly diverted with the facetious hints  and the pleasant   manner in which he gave them  and I promised to improve by the excellent   lessons contained in them       I then went up and dressed myself  as like a bride as I could  in my   best clothes  and  on inquiry  hearing my dearest master was gone to   walk in the garden  I went to find him out  He was reading in the little   alcove  and I said  Sir  am I licensed to intrude upon you   No  my   dear  said he  because you cannot intrude  I am so wholly yours  that    wherever I am  you have not only a right to join me  but you do me a   very acceptable favour at the same time       I have  sir  said I  obeyed your first kind injunction  as to dressing   myself before dinner  but may be you are busy  sir  He put up the papers   he was reading  and said  I can have no business or pleasure of equal   value to your company  my dear  What were you going to say   Only  sir    to know if you have any more kind injunctions to give me   I could hear   you talk a whole day together   You are very obliging  Pamela  said he    but you are so perfectly what I wish  that I might have spared those I   gave you  but I was willing you should have a taste of my freedom with   you  to put you upon the like with me  For I am confident there can be   no friendship lasting  without freedom  and without communicating to one   another even the little caprices  if my Pamela can have any such  which   may occasion uneasiness to either       Now  my dear  said he  be so kind as to find some fault with me  and   tell me what you would wish me to do  to appear more agreeable to you    O sir  said I  and I could have kissed him  but for shame   To be sure   I shall grow a sad fond hussy   I have not one single thing to wish for    no  not one   He saluted me very kindly  and said  He should be sorry if   I had  and forbore to speak it  Do you think  my dear sir  said I  that   your Pamela has no conscience  Do you think  that because you so   kindly
