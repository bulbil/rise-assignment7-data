The time before dinner was devoted to conversation  Sir Charles was nobody s  no  not very particularly his Bride s  He put every one upon speaking in turn  For about half an hour he sat between the joyful Mrs  Shirley and Mrs  Selby  but even then  in talking to them  talked to the whole company  Yet  in his air and manner to both  shewed so much respect  as needed not the aid of a particular address to them in words   This was observed to me by good Lord L  For Harriet  uneasy  every eye continually upon her  thoughtful  bashful  withdrawing  a little before dinner  with a cast of her eye to me  I followed her to her dressing room  There  with so much expressiveness of meaning  tho  not of language  so much tenderness of love  so much pious gratitude  so much true virgin sensibility  did she open her heart to me  that I shall ever revolve what passed in that conversation  as the true criterion of Virgin Delicacy unmingled with Affectation  Nor was I displeased that  in the height of her grateful Self congratulation  she more than once acknowleged a sigh for the admirable Clementina  We just began to express our pleasure and our hopes in the good behaviour of our Emily  when we were called to dinner   It was a sumptuous one   Mr  Selby was very orderly  upon the whole  But he remembred  he said  that when he was married  and he called upon his Dame to confirm it  he was obliged to wait on his Bride  and the Company  and he insisted upon it  that Sir Charles should   No  no  no  every one said  and the Bride looked a little serious upon it  But Sir Charles  with an air   339 of gaiety that infinitely became him  took a napkin from the butler  and putting it under his arm  I have only one request to make you  my dear Mr  Selby—When I am more aukward than I ought to be  do you correct me  and I shall have both pride and pleasure in the task   Adad  said Mr  Selby  looking at him with pleasure—You may be any thing  do any thing  you cannot conceal the Gentleman  Ads heart  you must always be the first man in company—Pardon me  my Lords   Sir Charles was the modestest servitor that ever waited at table  while his napkin was under his arm  But he laid it down  While he addressed himself to the company  finding something to say to each in his pithy  agreeable manner  as he went round the table  He made every one happy  With what delight did the elder Ladies look upon him  when he addressed himself to each of them  He stopt at the Bride s chair  and made her a compliment with an air of tenderness  I heard not what it was  sitting at distance  but she looked grateful  pleased  smiled  and blushed  He passed from her to the Bride maids  and again complimented each of them  They also seemed delighted with what he said  Then going to Mr  Selby  Why don t you bid me resume the napkin  Sir —No  no  we see what you can do  Your conformity is enough for me  You may now sit down  when you please  You make the waiters look aukward   He took his seat  thanked Mr  Selby for having reminded him of his duty  as he called it  and was all Himself  the most graceful and obliging of men   You know  my dear Lady L  how much I love to praise my brother  Neither I  nor the young Ladies  not even those who had humble servants present  regarded any body but him  My poor Lord —I am glad  however  that he has a tolerable good set of   340 teeth—They were always visible  A good honest sort of man  tho   Lady L  whatever you may think of him   After dinner  at Mr  Selby s reminding motion  Sir Charles and the men went to the tenants  They all wished him joy  and  as they would not sit down  while he stood  Sir Charles took a seat among them  and all the rest followed his example   One of the honest men  it seems  remembred the Nuptials of Mr  and Mrs  Byron  and praised them as the best and happiest of the human race  Others confirmed his character of both  Another knew the late Mr  Shirley  and extolled him as much  Another remembred the birth  another the christening  of the Bride  and others talked of what an excellent creature she was from her infancy  Let me tell you  Sir  said one grey headed man  you will have much ado to deserve her  and yet you are said to be as good as you are handsome  The women took up the cause  They were sure  by what they had heard  if any man in the world could deserve the Bride  it was Sir Charles Grandison  and they would swear for him by
