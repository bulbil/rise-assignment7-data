honour unnecessarily to any man  from under that guardianship   and protection which I vowed to her in marriage  It is very   well  Mr  Clement   you may hear from me to morrow  And away   he went      He was equal to his word  The very next morning I was arrested         90 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      at his suit for two hundred and fourscore guineas  the amount of   all that I had received from him   and I was hurried to the Fleet   prison without being permitted to speak to any one      As my lord knew that  on issue  I must cast him in his action    and further come upon him for special damage and false duress  it   instantly occurred that this was merely a stratagem for the seduc    tion of my Arabella   and her defenceless state gave me inexpressible   torture  I immediately wrote her an account of my situation and   apprehensions  which unhappily for all parties were too well    founded      But  sir  I will not afflict you or myself by giving you a detail of   these extraordinary events  as I afterwards learned them from the   mouth of my wife  and from the testimony of others on trial in the   public court  For  alas   even now  when all anger should be dead    the remembrance of so much injury and outrage offered to one so   pure  so helpless  and so gentle  wakes up the old indignation  and   stirs my spirit to its centre      Sufficient to say that  taking occasion by my absence  my lord   paid my wife a visit   that he had the audacity to make base over    tures to her  and to proffer her a large purse   the former she had   repulsed with scorn  the latter she had flung after him  as he   retreated baffled and enraged  She then at once commenced to   make up a sum by the sale of furniture  and other articles which   she could spare  and by the afternoon of the following day  with   incredible labour she had procured 40  which  with her former   deposit of 260  was more than sufficient for my release   and  as she   was putting on her bonnet to come to me  her maid was suddenly   called into the street  and Lord Stivers entered  Then began the   first act of the tragedy which shadowed our life so long   he had   bribed her servant  and filled her kitchen with his retainers  At   once  and casting aside all disguise  he addressed her in terms   loathsome to her pure womanly nature  and  disregarding her   pathetic prayers and appeals to his better feelings  he proceeded to   such a measure of violence that he stung the lamb into a lioness     and finding no help  from earth or heaven  near  in the agony and   the wrath of the minute  she became the justifier of her own purity    and the executioner in the cause of her endangered honour  by   slaying her brutal assailant      When the fatal blow was given  she at once went running to the   cradle  where her infant lay crying   she caught him in her arms     and opening the chamber door softly  and shutting it after her  she   stepped down stairs as upon feathers  and stealing to the street door    she opened it suddenly  rushed into the street  and hurried on till   she came to a stand of coaches  where she hired the first she met    threw herself hastily into it  and desired the man to drive with all   speed to the Fleet prison      On her arrival she discharged the action and fees of arrest with   all possible despatch  and then hurried up to my apartment  On   the first gh mpse I sprung to her  and caught her in my arms with   unspeakable transport  but finding the child with her  and observing   that her breath was quick and uneven  I withdrew a step or two    and looked eagerly at her   and perceiving that she was pale  and         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  91     had a kind of wildness in her eyes and motions What is the   matter  my love  I cried   what has happened to you   I have not   been well  she answered with an affected unconcern before the   keeper  But pray come down  my dear  you are much wanted    and the coach is in waiting      Nothing further passed between us till we got into the coach    and that my wife
