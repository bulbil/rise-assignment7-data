no cross accident intervenes  at the        time and place I mentioned  but impute this condescension to no        other motive than that compassion you implore  I flatter myself        your intentions are honourable  and  in that belief  am  Sir  your        humble servant            A  FORWARD         Miss Betsy  during the repetition of this letter  and some time before    shook her head  and shewed great tokens of surprize and disapprobation    but offering no interruption  the other went on in her discourse in this   manner        I protest to you  my dear Miss Betsy   said she   that I had nothing in   view by this letter but to secure him to me as a lover  I never had   reason to repent of the private correspondence I carried on with Mr    Sparkish  nor knew it was in the nature of man to take advantage of a   maid s simplicity  but I will not protract the narrative I promised  by   any needless particulars  Every thing happened but too fortunately    alas  according to my wish  I found Mr  Wildly in the church porch  gave   him the fatal billet  unperceived by any one  Night came on  all the   family were gone to their repose  and I  unseen  unheard  and   unsuspected  quitted my chamber  and  taking the route I told you of    opened the garden door  where  it seems  the person I expected had   waited above half an hour        His first salutations were the most humble  and withal the most   endearing  that could be   My angel   said he   how heavenly good you   are  Permit me thus to thank you   With these words he threw himself on   his knees  and taking one of my hands  kissed it with the extremest   tenderness  But  oh  let no young woman depend on the first professions   of her lover  nor in her own power of keeping him at a proper distance        Here a sudden gush of tears prevented her  for some minutes  from   prosecuting her discourse  and Miss Betsy found herself obliged to treat   her with more tenderness than  in her own mind  she thought the nature   of her case deserved                CHAPTER XIV       Concludes Miss Forward s narrative  and relates some farther   particulars of Miss Betsy s behaviour  on hearing a detail she so little   expected          How sweet are the consolations of a sincere friend  How greatly do they   alleviate the severest of misfortunes   Miss Forward soon dried up her   tears  on a soft commiseration she saw they excited in Miss Betsy  and   stifling  as well as she could  the rising sighs with which her bosom   heaved at the remembrance of what she was going to relate  resumed her   mournful story in these terms        You may very well suppose   said she   that the garden door was not a   proper place to entertain my lover in  good manners forbade me to use   him in so coarse a manner  besides  late as it was  some passenger might   happen to come that way  I therefore led him into the arbour at the end   of the terrace  where we sat down together on that broad bench under the   arch  where you so often used to loll  and call it your throne of state    Never was there a finer night  the moon  and her attendant stars  shone   with uncommon brightness  the air was all serene  the boisterous winds   were all locked in their caverns  and only gentle zephyrs  with their   fanning wings  wafted a thousand odours from the neighbouring plants    perfuming all around  It was an enchanting scene  Nature herself seemed   to conspire my ruin  and contributed all in her power to lull my mind   into a soft forgetfulness of what I owed myself  my fame  my   fortune  and my family        I was beginning to tell him how sensible I was  that to admit him in   this manner was against all the rules of decency and decorum  and that I   hoped he would not abuse the good opinion I had of him  nor entertain   the worse of me for my so readily complying with his request  and   such like stuff  to which he gave little ear  and only answered me with   protestations of the most violent
