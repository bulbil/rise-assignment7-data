  Say an old soldier  rather  madam    replied he  with some   warmth     the other is a term I am not used to          A nice distinction  truly  and well worthy of a man of honour      said the agent with a sneer        Have a care  sir   guard your expressions   my respect  my   obligations to her grace will make me bear anything from her  But   I must be so free as to tell you that I have not the same sentiments   for you          What  are you going to make a riot in my apartments           Not in the least  madam   my respect for your grace is a suffi    cient security from that  I would only hint it to that gentleman    that he may not always have the protection of your grace s presence     that is all  madam          You are a knavish old ruffian   but I shall take care that you do   not come off so            162 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA       As your grace pleases for that  By the laws of my country I   oannot lose my commission while I do my duty  nor will my gracious   master be influenced to do me wrong  though  in the multiplicity of   greater affairs  my services  my hardships could not reach his eye    But as I would not bear the imputation of any crime  much more so   black ones as dishonesty or ingratitude  you must give me leave to   set this affair in a just light to your grace now  especially as I may   never have another opportunity of doing myself that justice        Enraged  almost to desperation  to find that thirty years  service   â€” the merits of which were often written in my blood  and stand   recorded in these scars â€” were not sufficient to procure me the regular   advances of my rank  without a merit of another nature  I resolved   to quit the barren paths which I had so long pursued in vain  and   try those methods which I saw practised with success by others    I therefore applied myself to your grace  who seemed struck with   my hardships  and promised me your favour  referring me  for more   particular information  to this gentleman  who would have lowered   my sense of your goodness  by loadiug it with terms which were not   in my power to fulfil        Had your grace mentioned them to me yourself  I should most   certainly have owned my inability   but  coming from him  I looked   upon them as the finesse of his own art  which it was not imjustifi    able to return with a feint of mine   and therefore I gave an equi    vocal acquiescence with his proposal  for he dares not say I made a   particular or positive promise of anything        If I have done wrong in this  I am mistaken  and sorry for it     but still it is not within the article of war that makes an error in   judgment criminal  because it was not against an enemy   but by   all the rules of war  and that is my profession  and the only one I   have studied  it is allowable to oppose art to art  and try to foil   the devil at his own weapons  This is what I have done   and the   success of this stratagem  which has effected by a coup de main   what I had been making regular advances to so long in vain  proves   the justness of my plan  and must extort your grace s approbation    when the passion raised by this gentleman s mercenary influence   shall cool        Saying this  the veteran marched off in triumph  leaving my   mistress and her agent staring at each other in the strongest surprise      Her grace found utterance first  and having no other object of her   rage  turned all its violence upon her agent        So then    said she    after all  I find the old ruffian has outwitted   you  with a general promise  or no promise at all  it seems  for you   did not dare to contradict him  I thought  sir  that I had cautioned   you before against this very thing  and given you positive orders to   take nothing but the money  But you shall pay for your neglect     you shall make good the loss to me
