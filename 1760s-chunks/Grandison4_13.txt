with their pretty perversenesses   O Sir Charles Grandison  said my Lady  both her hands lifted up     32 Let us be contented  proceeded I  with such their kind acknowlegements  and in pity to them  and in compliment to ourselves  bear with their foibles —See  n adam  I ever was an advocate for the Ladies   Sir Charles  I have no patience with you—  What can a poor Woman do  continued I  when opposed  She can only be a little violent in words  and when she has said as much as she chuses to say  be perhaps a little sullen  For my part  were I so happy as to call a woman mine  and she happened to be in the wrong  I would endeavour to be in the right  and trust to her good sense to recover her temper  Arguments only beget arguments —Those reconciliations are the most durable  in which the Lady makes the advances   What doctrine is this  Sir Charles  You are not the man I took you for —I believe  in my conscience  that you are not near so good a man  as the world reports you   What  madam  because I pretend to know a little of the sex  Surely  Lady Beauchamp  a man of common penetration may see to the bottom of a woman s heart  A cunning woman cannot hide it  A good woman will not  You are not  madam  such Mysteries  as some of us think you  Whenever you know your own minds  we need not be long doubtful  That is all the difficulty  And I will vindicate you  as to that—  As how  pray  Sir —  Women  madam  were designed to be dependent  as well as gentle  creatures  and of consequence when left to their own wills  they know not what to resolve upon   I was hoping  Sir Charles  just now  that you would stay to dinner  But if you talk at this rate  I believe I shall be ready to wish you out of the house   Sir Harry looked as if he were half willing to be diverted at what passed between his lady and me    33 It was better for me to say what he could not but subscribe to by his feeling  than for him to say it  Tho  reproof seldom amends a determined spirit  such a one as this lady s  yet a man who suffers by it cannot but have some joy when he hears his sentiments spoken by a by stander  This freedom of mine seemed to save the married pair a good deal of recrimination   You remind me  madam  that I must be gone  rising and looking at my watch   You must not leave us  Sir Charles  said Sir Harry   I beg excuse  Sir Harry—Yours  also  madam  smiling—Lady Beauchamp must not twice wish me out of the house   I will not excuse you  Sir  reply d she—If you have a desire to see the matter compleated—She stopt—You must stay to dinner  be that as it will    Be that as it will   madam —You shall not recede   Recede  I have not yet complied—  O these women  They are so used to courtship  that they know not how to do right things without it—And  pardon  me  madam  not always with it   Bold man—Have I consented—  Have you not  madam  given a Lady s consent  That we men expect not to be very explicit  very gracious—It is from such non negative consents  that we men make silence answer all we wish   I leave Sir Charles Grandison to manage this point  said Sir Harry  In my conscience  I think the common observation just  A stander by sees more of the game  than he that plays   It ever will be so  Sir Harry—But I will tell you  My Lady and I have as good as agreed the matter—  I have agreed to nothing  Sir Harry—  Hush  madam—I am doing you credit —Lady Beauchamp speaks aside sometimes  Sir Harry  You are not to hear any thing she says  that you don t like     34 Then I am afraid I must stop my ears for eight hours out of twelve   That was aside  Lady Beauchamp—You are not to hear that   To sit  like a fool  and hear myself abused—A pretty figure I make  Sir Charles Grandison  let me tell you  that you are the first man that ever treated me like a fool   Excuse  madam  a little innocent raillery—I met you both  with a discomposure on your countenances  I was the occasion of it  by the letter I sent to Sir Harry  I will not leave you discomposed  I think you a woman of sense  and my request is of such a nature  that the granting of it will confirm to me  that you are so—But you have granted it—  I have not   That s charmingly said—My Lady will not undervalue the compliment she is inclined to make you  Sir Harry  The moment you ask for her compliance  she will not refuse
