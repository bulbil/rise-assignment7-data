while the iron was hot     165 —He forthwith mounted an old tub  which was his public rostrum  and waving his hand in an oratorial attitude  was immediately surrounded with the thronging popoulace —I have already given you a specimen of his manner  and therefore shall not repeat the tropes and figures of his harangue  but only sketch out the plan of his address  and specify the chain of his argument alone  He assailed them in the way of paradox  which never fails to produce a wonderful effect upon a heated imagination and a shallow understanding  Having  in his exordium  artfully fascinated their faculties  like a juggler in Bartholomew fair  by means of an assemblage of words without meaning or import  he proceeded to demonstrate  that a wise and good man ought to discard his maxims the moment he finds they are certainly established on the foundation    166 of eternal truth  That the people of Japan ought to preserve the farm of Yesso  as the apple of their eye  because nature had disjoined it from their empire  and the maintenance of it would involve them in all the quarrels of Tartary  that it was to be preserved at all hazards  because it was not worth preserving  that all the power and opulence of Japan ought to be exerted and employed in its defence  because  by the nature of irs situation  it could not possibly be defended  that Brutan tiffi was the great protector of the religion of the Bonzas  because he had never shewn the least regard to any religion at all  that he was the fast friend of Japan  because he had more than once acted as a rancorous enemy to this empire  and never let slip the least opportunity of expressing his contempt for the subjects of Niphon  that he was an    167 invincible hero  because he had been thrice beaten  and once compelled to raise a siege in the course of two campaigns  that he was a prince of consummate honour  because he had in the time of profound peace  usurped the dominions and ravaged the countries of his neighbours  in defiance of common honesty  in violation of the most solemn treaties  that he was the most honourable and important ally that the empire of Japan could choose  because his alliance was to be purchased with an enormous annual tribute  for which he was bound to perform no earthly office of friendship or assistance  because connexion with him effectually deprived Japan of the friendship of all the other princes and states of Tartary  and the utmost exertion of his power could never conduce  in the smallest degree  to the interest or advantage of the Japonese empire      168 Such were the propositions orator Taycho undertook to demonstrate  and the success justified his undertaking  After a weak mind has been duly prepared  and turned as it were  by opening a sluice or torrent of high sounding words  the greater the contradiction proposed the stronger impression it makes  because it increases the puzzle  and lays fast hold on the admiration  depositing the small proportion of reason with which it was before impregnated  like the vitriol acid in the copper mines of Wicklow  into which if you immerse iron  it immediately quits the copper which it had before dissolved  and unites with the other metal  to which it has a strongerattraction —Orator Taycho was not so well skilled in logic as to amuse his audience with definitions of concrete and abstract terms  or expatiate upon the genus and the difference  or state    169 propositions by the subject  the predicate  and the copula  or form syllogisms by mood and figure  but he was perfectly well acquainted with all the equivocal or synonimous words in his own language  and could ring the changes on them with great dexterity  He knew perfectly well how to express the same ideas by words that literally implied opposition —for example  a valuable conquest or an invaluable conquest  a shameful rascal or a shameful villain  a hard head or a soft head  a large conscience or no conscience  immensely great or immensely little  damned high or damned low  damned bitter  damned sweet  damned severe  damned insipid  and damned fulsome  He knew how to invert the sense of words by changing the manner of pronunciation  e  g     You are a very pretty fellow    to signify    You are a very dirty scoundrel  —     170   You have always spoke respectfully of the higher powers    to express    You have often insulted your betters  and even your sovereign     You have never turned tail to the principles you professed    to declare    You have acted the part of an infamous apostate    He was well aware that words alter their signification according to the circumstances of times  customs  and the difference of opinion  Thus the name of Jack  who used to turn the spit and pull off his master s boots  was transferred to an iron machine and a wooden instrument now substituted for these purposes  thus a stand for the tea kettle  acquired the name of Footman  and the words Canon and Ordinance  signifying originally a rule or law  was extended to a piece of artillery
