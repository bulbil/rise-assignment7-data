A GUINEA       In a rank scarce inferior to that of a sovereign  and possessed of a   fortune sufficient to support it with dignity to himself and benefit   to the community  did this man enter into life   but a few years   of the dissipation of what is falsely called a life of pleasure distressed   his fortune and debased his principles to such a degree  that he was   obliged  and not ashamed  to have recourse to the method of a   mercenary marriage  to retrieve his affairs  and enable him to sup    port the external appearance of his character  The constant conse    quences of these marriages might be sufficient to open the eyes of   the unhappy victims of them to such a dangerous folly   but vanity   possesses so absolute an empire over the female heart  that nothing   can prevent the gratification of it        The female whom this person pitched upon  as proper for his   purpose  on account of her immense wealth  was destitute of every   charm of mind and person to attract or preserve love or esteem    But few are sensible of their own deficiencies  or can bear to be   informed of them  On his making the first overture to her  all her   real friends took the alarm   they drew his character in proper   colours   they showed her that necessity  not inclination  was the   motive of his addresses  and they laid the inevitable consequences   of a connection with such a person before her in the strongest light     but all was in vain  Her heart was fixed upon rank and pre    cedence  and  so she could obtain them  she left the rest to chance    Accordingly  as she was absolutely her own mistress  the match   was soon made  to the present satisfaction of both parties  He got   her fortune to pay his debts and pursue his pleasures  and she rode   in a coach with coronets  and was called her grace        But this mutual happiness did not last long  The moment he   got possession of her fortune  all his wishes were fulfilled  and  as he   had nothing further to expect  he did not think it necessary for him   to continue any appearances of love  or even complaisance  for an   object really disagreeable to him  Accordingly  the very morning   after his marriage  he set out upon a party of pleasure  with some of   his former companions  and left the bride by herself to receive the   compliments  and go through the farce usual on such occasions    Though such behaviour must appear base and ungenerous to the   last degree  yet she had no right to complain of it  as she could not   expect any other from his known character and motives for marriage    She therefore put the best face on the matter  and whether from   intoxication at her elevation  or indifference to him  seemed to be   insensible of the slight  and went through the ceremony and parade   with all the appearance of pleasure and content  leaving him to   pursue his own inclination  without molestation or complaint        But this calm did not hold long  As soon as new dignity lost   the charms of novelty  nature awoke  as from a dream  and convinced   her that something more than empty show was necessary to human   happiness  But  alas   this conviction came too late  and all her   expostulations were as ineffectual to induce the tenderness or esteem   of her husband  as those of her friends had been with her  to prevent   her marrjang him  On the contrary  they turned his indifference   into aversion  and made him treat her with indignity and contempt    insulting her deformity  and ridiculing the vanity that had prompted         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 263     her to sacrifice her fortune for a bare title  Hard aa such  treatment   was to be submitted to  she had no redress  but was obliged to bear   it in silence  without even the poor consolation of compassion to   mitigate her sufferings  At length a further aggravation of her   wrongs gave her the pleasure of revenge  by c iving him again   into the distresses from which her folly had relieved him        In the pursuit of pleasure  to which he had sacrificed his character   and fortune  he never had even the excuse of a refined taste or par    ticular passion to palliate his folly  but blindly followed the example   of his companions  or was a slave to every gross impulse of his own   caprice  without the least notion of delicacy  or even decency to   direct him  Aa he was
