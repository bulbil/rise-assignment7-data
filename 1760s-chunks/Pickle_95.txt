if he had been commander of the ship  The skipper  looked upon him as an angel sent to his assistance  and the crew  soon discovered him to be a thoroughbred seaman  notwithstanding his  livery frock  obeyed his orders with such alacrity  that  in a little  time  the confusion vanished  and every necessary step was taken to  weather the gale   Our young gentleman immediately conceived the meaning of Tom s  appearance on board  and when the tumult was a little subsided  went up   and encouraged him to exert himself for the preservation of the ship   promising to take him again into his service  from which he should never  be dismissed  except at his own desire  This assurance had a surprising  effect upon Pipes  who  though he made no manner of reply  thrust the  helm into the master s hands  saying   Here  you old bumboat woman  take  hold of the tiller  and keep her thus  boy  thus   and skipped about the  vessel  trimming the sails  and managing the ropes with such agility and  skill  that everybody on deck stood amazed at his dexterity   Mr  Jolter was far from being unconcerned at the uncommon motion of the  vessel  the singing of the wind  and the uproar which he heard about  him  he looked towards the cabin door with the most fearful expectation   in hope of seeing some person who could give some account of the  weather  and what was doing upon deck  but not a soul appeared  and he  was too well acquainted with the disposition of his own bowels to make  the least alteration in his attitude  When he had lain a good while in  all the agony of suspense  the boy tumbled headlong into his apartment   with such noise  that he believed the mast had gone by the board  and  starting upright in his bed  asked  with all the symptoms of horror   what was the cause of that disturbance  The boy  half stunned by his  fall  answered in a dolorous tone   I m come to put up the dead lights    At the mention of dead lights  the meaning of which he did not  understand  the poor governor s heart died within him  he shivered with    6 22 15  3 45 PM   despair  his recollection forsaking him  he fell upon his knees in the  bed  and  fixing his eyes upon the book which was in his hand  began to  pronounce aloud with great fervour   The time of a complete oscillation  in the cycloid  is to the time in which a body would fall through  the axis of the cycloid DV  as the circumference of a circle to its  diameter    He would in all likelihood have proceeded with the demonstration of this  proposition  had he not been seized with such a qualm as compelled  him to drop the book  and accommodate himself to the emergency of his  distemper  he therefore stretched himself at full length  and  putting  up ejaculations to Heaven  began to prepare himself for his latter end   when all of a sudden the noise above was intermitted  and as he could  not conceive the cause of this tremendous silence  he imagined that  either the men were washed overboard  or that  despairing of safety   they had ceased to oppose the tempest  While he was harrowed by this  miserable uncertainty  which  however  was not altogether unenlightened  by some scattered rays of hope  the master entered the cabin  then he  asked  with a voice half extinguished by fear  how matters went upon  deck  and the skipper  with a large bottle of brandy applied to his  mouth  answered  in a hollow tone   All s over now  master   Upon which   Mr  Jolter  giving himself over for lost  exclaimed  with the utmost  horror   Lord have mercy upon us  Christ have mercy upon us   and  repeated this supplication  as it were mechanically  until the master  undeceived him by explaining the meaning of what he had said  and  assuring him that the squall was over   Such a sudden transition from fear to joy occasioned a violent agitation  both in his mind and body  and it was a full quarter of an hour  before  he recovered the right use of his organs  By this time the weather  cleared up  the wind began to blow again from the right corner  and the  spires of Calais appeared at the distance of five leagues  so that the  countenances of all on board were lighted up with joyous expectation and  Peregrine  venturing to go down into the cabin  comforted his governor  with an account of the happy turn of their affairs   Jolter  transported with the thought of a speedy landing  began to  launch out in praise of that country for which they were bound  He  observed  that France was the land of politeness and hospitality  which  were conspicuous in the behaviour of all ranks and degrees
