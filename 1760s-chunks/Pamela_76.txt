unperceived  and the maid finding the hussy  I took it  and sauntered   in again  and met Mrs  Jewkes coming to see after me  What I wrote was   this           REVEREND SIR        The want of an opportunity to speak my mind to you  I am sure will   excuse this boldness in a poor creature that is betrayed hither  I have   reason to think  for the worst of purposes  You know something  to be   sure  of my story  my native poverty  which I am not ashamed of  my late   lady s goodness  and my master s designs upon me  It is true he promises   honour  and all that  but the honour of the wicked is disgrace and shame   to the virtuous  And he may think he keeps his promises  according to   the notions he may allow himself to hold  and yet  according to mine and   every good body s  basely ruin me        I am so wretched  and ill treated by this Mrs  Jewkes  and she is so   ill principled a woman  that  as I may soon want the opportunity which   the happy hint of this day affords to my hopes  I throw myself at once   upon your goodness  without the least reserve  for I cannot be worse   than I am  should that fail me  which  I dare say  to your power  it   will not  For I see it  sir  in your looks  I hope it from your cloth    and I doubt it not from your inclination  in a case circumstanced as my   unhappy one is  For  sir  in helping me out of my present distress    you perform all the acts of religion in one  and the highest mercy and   charity  both to the body and soul of a poor wretch  that  believe   me  sir  has  at present  not so much as in thought swerved from her   innocence        Is there not some way to be found out for my escape  without danger to   yourself  Is there no gentleman or lady of virtue in this neighbourhood    to whom I may fly  only till l can find a way to get to my poor father   and mother  Cannot Lady Davers be made acquainted with my sad story  by   your conveying a letter to her  My poor parents are so low in the world    they can do nothing but break their hearts for me  and that  I fear    will be the end of it        My master promises  if I will be easy  as he calls it  in my present   lot  he will not come down without my consent  Alas  sir  this is   nothing  For what s the promise of a person who thinks himself at   liberty to act as he has done by me  If he comes  it must be to ruin me    and come to be sure he will  when he thinks he has silenced the clamours   of my friends  and lulled me  as no doubt he hopes  into a fatal   security        Now  therefore  sir  is all the time I have to work and struggle for   the preservation of my honesty  If I stay till he comes  I am undone    You have a key to the back garden door  I have great hopes from that    Study  good sir  and contrive for me  I will faithfully keep your   secret   Yet I should be loath to have you suffer for me  I say no more    but commit this to the happy tiles  in the bosom of that earth  where  I   hope  my deliverance will take root  and bring forth such fruit  as may   turn to my inexpressible joy  and your eternal reward  both here and   hereafter  As shall ever pray   Your oppressed humble servant           Thursday       This completes a terrible week since my setting out  as I hoped to see   you  my dear father and mother  O how different were my hopes then  from   what they are now  Yet who knows what these happy tiles may produce       But I must tell you  first  how I have been beaten by Mrs  Jewkes  It is   very true   And thus it came about       My impatience was great to walk in the garden  to see if any thing had   offered  answerable to my hopes  But this wicked Mrs  Jewkes would not   let me go without her  and said  she was not at leisure
