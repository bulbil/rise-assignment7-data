happiness intirely dependent on rank or fortune  and have only to wish my mother s sentiments on this subject more agreable to my own  as there is nothing I so much wish as to oblige her  at all events  however  depend on my fulfilling those promises  which ought to be the more binding  as they were made at a time when our situations were more equal       I am happy in an opportunity of convincing you and the world  that interest and ambition have no power over my heart  when put in competition with what I owe to my engagements  being with the greatest truth       My dearest Madam   Yours   c   G  CLAYTON       You will do me the honor to name the day to make me happy     LETTER LX   60   To Sir GEORGE CLAYTON  at Quebec       Dear Sir   I HAVE read Mrs  Clayton s letter with attention  and am of her opinion  that indiscreet engagements are better broke than kept        I have the less reason to take ill your breaking the kind of engagement between us at the desire of your family  as I entered into it at first entirely in compliance with mine  I have ever had the sincerest esteem and friendship for you  but never that romantic love which hurries us to forget all but itself  I have therefore no reason to expect in you the imprudent disinterestedness that passion occasions       A fuller explanation is necessary on this subject than it is possible to enter into in a letter  if you will favor us with your company this afternoon at Silleri  we may explain our sentiments more clearly to each other  be assured  I never will prevent your complying in every instance with the wishes of so kind and prudent a mother       I am  dear Sir   Your affectionate friend         and obedient servant    EMILY MONTAGUE     LETTER LXI   61   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   I have been with Emily  who has been reading Mrs  Clayton s letter  I saw joy sparkle in her eyes as she went on  her little heart seemed to flutter with transport  I see two things very clearly  one of which is  that she never loved this little insipid Baronet  the other I leave your sagacity to find out  All the spirit of her countenance is returned  she walks in air  her cheeks have the blush of pleasure  I never saw so astonishing a change  I never felt more joy from the acquisition of a new lover  than she seems to find in the prospect of losing an old one        She has written to Sir George  and in a style that I know will hurt him  for though I believe he wishes her to give him up  yet his vanity would desire it should cost her very dear  and appear the effort of disinterested love  and romantic generosity  not what it really is  the effect of the most tranquil and perfect indifference       By the way  a disinterested mistress is  according to my ideas  a mistress who fancies she loves  we may talk what we please  at a distance  of sacrificing the dear man to his interest  and promoting his happiness by destroying our own  but when it comes to the point  I am rather inclined to believe all women are of my way of thinking  and let me die if I would give up a man I loved to the first dutchess in Christendom   tis all mighty well in theory  but for the practical part  let who will believe it for Bell       Indeed when a woman finds her lover inclined to change   tis good to make a virtue of necessity  and give the thing a sentimental turn  which gratifies his vanity  and does not wound one s own       Adieu  I see Sir George and his fine carriole  I must run  and tell Emily    Ever yours   A  FERMOR      LETTER LXII   62   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Jan  28   YES  my Lucy  your brother tenderly regrets the absence of a sister endeared to him much more by her amiable qualities than by blood  who would be the object of his esteem and admiration  if she was not that of his fraternal tenderness  who has all the blooming graces  simplicity  and innocence of nineteen  with the accomplishments and understanding of five and twenty  who joins the strength of mind so often confined to our sex  to the softness  delicacy  and vivacity of her own  who  in short  is all that is estimable and lovely  and who  except one  is the most charming of her sex  you will forgive the exception  Lucy  perhaps no man but a brother would make it       My sweet Emily appears every day more amiable  she is now in the full tyranny of her charms  at the age when the mind is improved  and the person in its perfection  I every day see in her more indifference to her lover  a circumstance
