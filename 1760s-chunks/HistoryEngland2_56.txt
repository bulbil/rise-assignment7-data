 a had been settled at the revolution  In the course o this debate  in which they were opposed  as usual  by the ministry  they reflected  with great severity  o the measures of the late reign  They asserted  tha the septennial act was an incroachment on the right of the people  that during the continuance of tha parliament  several severe laws had been enacted that by one of these a man might be removed  and tried in any place where the jury might be favourable to the crown  and where the prisoners witnesses could not  or dare not  to come  That  by another  a justice of the peace was impowered to put the best subjects to immediate death only  after reading a proclamation against riots  The South Sea scheme  they said  was established by an act of a septennial parliament  and the excise bill had like  under their influence also  to have passed into a law  Sir William Wyndham distinguished himself in this debate    Let us suppose  said he  a man without any sense of honour raised to be a chief minister of state  Suppose him possessed of great wealth  the plunder of the nation  Suppose him screened by a corrupt majority of his creatures  and insulting over all men of family  sense  and honour  in the nation  Let us suppose a venal parliament  and an ignorant King  I hope such a case will never occur  but should such ever happen to be at once united  a short parliament will be the only means of lessening the evil    Notwithstanding these expostulations  the ministry were  as usual  victorious  and the motion suppressed by the majority  The Country party now found themselves out numbered upon every occasion  they had long complained  in vain  that debate was useless  since every member seemed to have listed himself under the banners of party  to which he held without shrinking  Despairing therefore of being able to stem the torrent of corruption  they retired to their seats in the country    151 and left the ministry an undisputed majority in the house     The minister being now left without opposition in the house  took this opportunity to render his rivals odious or contemptible  by getting several useful laws passed in their absence  while the King laboured  with equal assiduity  to adjust the political scale of Europe  and  for this purpose  made several journies to his Electoral dominions  But his assiduity in healing foreign differences did not prevent one of a more domestic nature  for a misunderstanding arose between him and the Prince of Wales  a Prince that was the darling of the people  and who professed his dislike both of the ministry and their venal measures  He had been  a short time before  married to the Princess of Saxegotha  and the Prince s mistaking a message from the King  at a time when the Princess was lying in  first caused the rupture  It was soon after widened by the vile emissaries of the court  so that his Majesty forbade the Prince his presence  and gave orders that none of his attendants should be admitted to court  A motion  however  was made in the house of commons  for increasing the Prince s settlement  which was but fifty thousand pounds  to an hundred thousand  It was represented that so much had been granted by the late King  to his present Majesty  when Prince of Wales  and that such a settlement was conformable to the practice of former times  and necessary to the independency of the heir apparent to the English crown  This motion was vigorously opposed by Sir Robert Walpole  as an incroachment on the prerogative  and an officious intermeddling in the King s family affairs  The supporters of the motion observed  that the allowance of fifty thousand pounds was not sufficient to defray the Prince s yearly expences  which  by his Majesty s own regulation  amounted to sixty three thousand  The motion  however  met the fate of all other antiministerial   152 measures  being rejected by the majority   But whatever imaginary disappointments the people might suffer  there was a blow levelled at the little wit that was left remaining  which has effectually banished all taste from the stage  and from which it has never since recovered  When Walpole entered into power  he resolved to despise that set of underrate writers  who live by arraigning every ministry  and disseminate scandal and abuse  For a time he prosecuted that intention  but  at last  found it necessary to employ a set of mean hirelings  to answer calumny with calumny  He wanted judgment to distinguish genius  or none possessed of such a gift were mean enough to applaud his measures  From hence he took an implacable aversion to the press  which so severely exposed his corruption  and branded his follies  But the press alone was not the only scourge he had to fear  the theatre joined all its ridicule  and he saw himself exposed as the object of scorn  as well as hatred  When license once transgresses the rules of decency  it knows no bounds Some of the pieces exhibited at that time were no only severe  but immoral also  This was what th minister held to  he
