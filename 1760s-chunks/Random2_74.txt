sound her averse to his proposal  which indeed she declined with a sweetness of denial peculiar to herself  as a piece of disrespect to that part of the company which did not understand the language in question  As I had the happiness of sitting opposite to her  I feasted my eyes much more than my palate  which she tempted in vain with the most delicious bits carved by her fair hand  and recommended by her persuasive tongue —but all my other appetites were swallowed up in the immensity of my love  which I fed by gazing incessantly on the delightful object —Dinner was scarce ended  when the squire became very drousy  and after several dreadful yawns  got up  stretched himself  took two or three turns across the room  begg d we would allow him to take a short nap  and having laid a strong injunction on his sister to detain us  till his return  went to his repose without any further ceremony —He had not been gone many minutes  when Freeman guessing the situation of my heart  and thinking he could not do me a greater favour  than to leave me alone with Narcissa  pretended to recollect himself all of a sudden  and starting up  begg d the lady s pardon for half an hour  having luckily remembered an engagement of some consequence  that he must perform at that instant —so saying  he went away  promising to be back in time enough for tea  leaving my mistress and me in great confusion —Now that I enjoyed an opportunity of disclosing the pantings of my soul  I had not power to use it—I studied many pathetic declarations  but when I attempted to give them utterance    218 my tongue denied its office  and she sat silent  with a downcast look full of anxious alarm  her bosom heaving with expectation of some great event—At length  I endeavoured to put an end to this solemn pause  and began with   It is very surprizing  Madam—  here the sound dying away  I made a full stop—while Narcissa starting  blushed  and with a timid accent  answered    Sir —  Confounded at this note of interrogation  I pronounced with the most sheepish bashfulness    Madam    to which she replied    I beg pardon—I thought you had spoke to me  —  Another pause ensued—I made another effort  and tho  my voice faultered very much at the beginning  made shift to express myself in this manner —   I say  Madam   tis very surprizing that love should act so inconsistent with itself  as to deprive its votaries of the use of their faculties  when they have most occasion for them  Since the happy occasion of being alone with you presented itself  I have made many unsuccessful attempts to declare a passion for the loveliest of her sex—a passion which took possession of my soul  while my cruel fate compell d me to wear a servile disguise so unsuitable to my birth  sentiments  and let me add  my deserts  yet favourable in one respect  as it furnished me with opportunities of seeing and adoring your perfections—Yes  Madam  it was then your dear idea entered my bosom  where it has lived unimpaired in the midst of numberless cares  and animated me against a thousand dangers and calamities  —  While I spoke thus  she concealed her face with her fan  and when I   219 ceased  recovering herself from the most beautiful confusion  told me  that she thought herself very much obliged by my favourable opinion of her  and that she was very sorry to hear I had been unfortunate—Encouraged by this gentle reply  I proceeded  owned myself sufficiently recompensed by her kind compassion for what I had undergone  and declared that the future happiness of my life depended solely upon her —   Sir   said she  I should be very ungrateful  if after the signal protection you once afforded me  I could refuse to contribute towards your happiness  in any reasonable condescension  —  Transported at this acknowledgment  I threw myself at her feet  and begged she would regard my passion with a favourable eye  She was alarmed at my behaviour  intreated me to rise lest her brother should discover me in that posture  and to spare her  for the present  upon a subject for which she was altogether unprepared —Upon this  I rose  assuring her I would rather die than disobey her  but in the mean time begged her to consider how precious the minutes of this opportunity were  and what restraint I put upon my inclination  in sacrificing them to her desire —She smiled with unspeakable sweetness  and said  there would be no want of opportunities  provided I could maintain the good opinion her brother had conceived of me  and I  enchanted with her charms  seized her hand  which I well nigh devoured with kisses—But she check d my boldness with a severity of countenance  and desired I would not so far forget myself or her  as to endanger the esteem she had for me —she reminded me of our being almost strangers to one another  and of the necessity there was  for her   220 knowing me better  before she could take any resolution in my favour  and  in short  mingled so much good sense
