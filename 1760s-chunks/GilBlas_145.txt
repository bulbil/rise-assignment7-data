had worn away into the heart of the rock  and the hand of man had added a rude front built of pebbles and shell work  covered all over with turf  The adjacent grounds were strewed with a thousand sorts of flowers  which scattered their perfume  and one was pleased to see hard by the grotto  a small fissure in the mountain  whence a spring rippled with a tinkling noise  and poured its pellucid stream along the meadow  At the entrance of this solitary abode stood a venerable hermit  seemingly weighed down with years  He supported himself with one hand upon a staff  and held a rosary of large beads with the other  composed of at least twenty rows  His head was almost lost in a brown woollen cap with long ears  and his beard  whiter than snow  swept down in aged majesty to his waist  We advanced towards him  Father  said I  is it your pleasure to allow us shelter from the threatening storm  Come in  my sons  replied the hermit  after examining me attentively  this hermitage is at your service  to occupy it during pleasure  As for your horse  added he  pointing to the court yard of his mansion  he will be very well off there  My companion disposed of the animal accordingly  and we followed the old man into the grotto   No sooner had we got in than a heavy rain fell  with a terrific storm of thunder and lightning  The hermit threw himself upon his knees before a consecrated image  fastened to the wall  and we followed the example of our host  Our devotions ceased with the subsiding of the storm  but as the rain continued  though with diminished violence  and night was not far distant  the old man said to us    My sons  you had better not pursue your journey in such weather  unless your affairs are pressing  We answered with one consent  that we had nothing to hinder us from staying there  but the fear of incommoding him  but that if there was room for us in the hermitage  we would thank him for a night s lodging  You may have it without inconvenience  answered the hermit  at least the inconvenience will be all your own  Your accommodation will be rough  and your meal such as a recluse has to offer   With this cordial welcome to a homely board  the holy personage seated us at a little table  and set before us a few vegetables  a crust of bread  and a pitcher of water  My sons  resumed he  you behold my ordinary fare  but to day I will make a feast in hospitality towards you  So saying  he fetched a little cheese and some nuts  which he threw down upon the table  The young man  whose appetite was not keen  felt but little tempted by his entertainment  I perceive  said the hermit to him  that you are accustomed to better tables than mine  or rather that sensuality has vitiated your natural relish  I have been in the world like you  The utmost ingenuity of the culinary art  whether to stimulate or soothe the palate  was exerted by turns for my gratification  But since I have lived in solitude  my taste has recovered its simplicity  Now  vegetables  fruit  and milk  are my greatest dainties  in a word  I keep an antediluvian table   While he was haranguing after this fashion  the young man fell into a deep musing  The hermit was aware of his inattention  My son  said he  some thing weighs upon your spirits  May we not be informed what disturbs you  Open your heart to me  Curiosity is not my motive for questioning you  but charity  and a desire to be of service  I am at a time of life to give advice  and you perhaps are under circumstances to stand in need of it  Yes  father  replied the gentleman with a sigh  I doubtless do stand in need of it  and will follow yours  since you are so good as to offer it  I cannot suppose there is any risk in unbosoming myself to a man like you  No  my son  said the old man  you have nothing to fear  it is under more stately roofs that confidences are betrayed  On this assurance the cavalier began his story       CH  X     The history of Don Alphonso and the fair Seraphina   I WILL attempt no disguise from you  my venerable friend  nor from this gentleman who completes my audience  After the generosity of his conduct towards me  I should be in the wrong to distrust him  You shall know my misfortunes from their beginning  I am a native of Madrid  and came into the world mysteriously  An officer of the German guard  Baron Steinbach by name  returning home one evening  espied a bundle of fair linen at the foot of his staircase  He took it up and carried it to his wife s apartment  where it turned out to be a new born infant  wrapped up in very handsome swaddling clothes  with a note containing an assurance that it belonged to persons of condition  who would come forward
