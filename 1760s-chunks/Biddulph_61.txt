and Sir George  telling me he had missed of the latter  when he was in London  being told he was at Sidney castle  After a few more indifferent questions  he took a dish of coffee  and retired with it to a window  Mr Arnold asked me in a whisper  if I was acquainted with Mr Faulkland  I could only answer  that I was formerly very well acquainted with him  Nothing more passed between Mr Faulkland and me the whole evening  he returned soon to the company in the next room  and I saw no more of him   I can with the utmost sincerity assure my Cecilia  that I now behold Mr Faulkland with as much indifference as I do any other man of my acquaintance  Time  joined to my own efforts  must  without any other help  have intirely subdued an inclination  which    was always restrained by prudential motives  and rendered subservient to my duty  but I have  besides this  now acquired a shield that must render me invulnerable  I mean the perfect and tender affection I bear my husband  this has completely secured me against the most distant apprehensions of being alarmed from any other quarter  yet notwithstanding all this  I can’t say that I am quite satisfied at this renewal of my acquaintance with Mr Faulkland  I hope  and indeed it is reasonable to suppose  that I have now as little interest in his heart as he has in mine  it is but natural to believe that a gay young man like him  should not be so weak as to nourish a hopeless passion for more than two years  especially as he has never once seen the object of it in all that time  and must  without doubt  have had his attention engaged to others in all likelihood much preferable to her  so that I think I have reason to be as easy on his account as on my own  But still I am disquieted in my mind  I have a delicacy that takes alarm at the veriest trifles  and has been a source of pain to me my whole lifetime  it makes me unhappy to think that I am now under an almost unavoidable necessity of sometimes seeing and conversing with a man  who once had such convincing proofs  that he was not indifferent to me   Mr Arnold’s ignorance of our former connections makes it still worse  At the time I was so averse to his knowing any thing of this affair  I flattered myself I should never see Mr Faulkland more  or at least never be obliged to have any intercourse with him  but I now lament that I did not take my mother’s advice  and disclose the whole affair at first  Oh  my Cecilia  when the smallest deviations from candor  which we suppose discretion   are thus punished with remorse  what must they feel whose whole life is one continued act of dissimulation  If Mr Arnold had been acquainted with my former engagements  my heart would be more at ease  and I should then converse with this man with all the disengaged freedom of a common friend  I wish Mr Arnold’s curiosity would excite him to ask me some questions relative to my acquaintance with Mr Faulkland  that I might have an opportunity of telling him the secret  But the enquiry he made at lady V——’s was in a careless manner  he was satisfied with my reply  and spoke not of him since   You will laugh perhaps when I tell you that I have not courage to mention it first  Mr Faulkland is reckoned a very fine gentleman  and I think it would have such an air of vanity to tell my husband that I refused him  then it would bring on such a train of explanations  and    poor Miss Burchell’s history must come out  for a husband on such a subject might be disgusted with concealments of any kind  and I doubt whether even some circumstances in my particular share of this story might not displease him  In short  I am bewildered  and know not what to wish for  but must e’en let things take their course  and rest satisfied in the integrity of my own heart   August 26  Oh  my dear  I am mortified to the last degree  lest Mr Arnold should  from some indiscreet tongue  have received a hint of my former engagement  he may think me disingenuous for never having mentioned it  especially since Mr Faulkland has been in the neighbourhood  I think his nature is too open to entertain any suspicions essentially injurious to me  yet may this affair  circumstanced as it is  make an unfavourable impression on him  I wish I had been before hand with any officious whisperer  he has got so many new acquaintance  and is so much abroad  that the story may have reached his ears  God forbid it should affect his mind with causeless uneasiness  I would Mr Faulkland were a thousand miles from V—— hall  I think Mr Arnold is altered since his arrival there—Colder he appears to be—I hope I but fancy it—yet there is a change—his looks are less kind—his voice has lost that tenderness  that it used to have in speaking to me—yet this may only be his temper—a man cannot always be a lover—Oh  I sicken at the very thought of Mr
