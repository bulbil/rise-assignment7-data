there  would betray a Want of Taste to root it out   The first Paragraph of the fifteenth Epistle gives me an Opportunity of renewing my Remark upon one of the Epistles of the first Volume  Page  149 I forget which of them  and  as I have returned you that Book  I cannot set myself right now  but it is where he comes very near preferring a Life of retired Leisure to public Business  but dares not speak quite out  for the Reasons there mentioned  In the Passage of this Letter  which I am now quoting  he says    I dare not say my Life would be better  but certainly it would be happier  if my Studies were my sole Employments     I think  Lord Orrery has mistaken that Passage in the eighteenth Epistle  where Pliny says    The Land itself will never want a Proprietor   for Pliny seems to consider this Farm with a View of setting it  not of selling  and therefore rather wants a Tenant  than a Purchaser  The original Expression     à quo exerceatur   seems to warrant this Sense     On the nineteenth Epistle  Faulkner makes a remarkable Blunder in the Comment  about the Genealogy of Fannia  but  indeed  the whole Edition of this Book is very faulty   In the Observations upon the twenty fifth Epistle  my Lord quotes  as a Proverb  this Sentence    He  that is not for me  is against me   by which he seems not to recollect  that it is a Passage in Scripture  and spoken by Page  150 our Saviour †  I am sure  if he had been aware of this  he would not have introduced it so lightly here     Adieu   LETTER CCXXX   I AM infinitely obliged to my dearest Life  for the Kindness and Constancy of his Letters  They have  indeed  almost made me Amends for the Pangs of Absence  I know nothing else that could have soothed  or even amused my Mind  but those dear Pledges of your Love  I confess I never felt such severe Anguish in my Life  as at our last Parting  and  though you appeared so then  I do not now believe you was indifferent  A thousand Circumstances concurred to render it more painful to me  than any of our former Separations  You have kindly obviated the most material  and I shall now endeavour to forget the past  and only look forward with the pleasing Hope of our Meeting   The Gentleness with which you treat my greatest Fault  will  I flatter myself  have a better Effect  than the severest Reproof  Allow me  my dearest Harry  to say  without a Boast  my Nature is honest  generous  and open  I was brought up with  perhaps  too much Tenderness and Lenity  Unused to Harshness  I cannot Page  151 easily bring myself to bear it from one I passionately love —But be assured I will endeavour to root this Weed  not Shrub  intirely out of your little Parterre   I wish I was as well able to vye with the Merits of Calpurnia s Character  as your Epistles  for Nobleness of Sentiment  Justness of Thought  Elegance  and Tenderness of Expression  may with Pliny s  but  alas  I fear I fall as far short of her  as you  in my Opinion  surpass him  In one Respect  however  I am sure I shall equal  if not exceed her  in my unbounded Love  and faithful Friendship for thee  thou dearest  most amiable  and deserving of thy Sex   I hope  when I write next  I shall be more at Peace  for I am not settled yet  In the mean Time  I beg you will excuse the Wildness and Incoherence of this Scrawl  and believe me  with the tenderest Affection and sincerest Esteem  your fond  and faithful   Fanny   LETTER CCXXXI   Dear FANNY   I RECEIVED no Letter from you by Tuesday Night s Post  so suppose there was not any Certainty  or Alteration in your Affairs  at that Time  worth recording  I have sent to Town  Page  152 expecting a Letter by Thursday s Post  and am very sure I shall not be disappointed  I hope the Letter itself may not disappoint me   Since I received Lady — s last Letter  I have had frequent Struggles with myself about answering it  If I do not answer it  I suffer the Correspondence to drop on my Side  which is unpolite  If I do answer  I may seem to presume too much upon an occasional Adventure  and thereby be deemed unworthy of the Honour proceeding from it  Upon the whole  I have determined in the Negative  and sacrificed my Inclinations to my Prudence  upon this Reasoning  that few Men can deserve such high Honour  by their Merits  but almost any Man may appear not unworthy of it  by his Modesty  One particular Thing  which tempted me to write  was  the occurring of some farther Thoughts upon that comfortable Subject of the Mercy of God  which was Part of my Letter to her
