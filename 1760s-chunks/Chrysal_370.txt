 their merit to offer them first to you  as there is no other collection   in the kingdom worthy of them   and I am above rising in a demand   I have once made  though infinitely short of their intrinsic value    as you will be convinced the moment you see them  Here  sir  is   the manuscript which I had the good fortune to meet with  as I was   rummaging among some old records in our office  that had never been   stirred since the reign of Henry VIII  The paper in which it was   wrapped was so decayed that it mouldered quite away  so immedi    ately upon its coming into the open air that I had scarce time to   read the contents  which were that this parchment had been found         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 445     in the tomb of Thomas a Beoket  upon the breaking up of his shrine   at the Reformation  and  was laid up there on account of its an    tiquity  That it must have been very ancient  even before his   time  the colour and decay of the parchment could sufficiently   prove  were there not other proofs stiU more convincing to such as   have judgment to comprehend them  The shape of the letter shows   its age  This manner of writing  as appears by comparing it with   other ancient manuscripts  was introduced in the beginning of the   second century of the Christian era  and quite dropped by the   middle of the third  Within that period  therefore  it must have   been written  Its antiquity being thus fixed  the purport of it is   next to be considered   and of that and its importance  there can   be no just room to doubt  This spot at the bottom of the parch    ment  though so much defaced by time  bears a strong resemblance   to the impression of a mitre  and thereby proves that some bishop   was the author of what was written over it  into which these four   letters  m â€” a â€” t â€”  h  fortunately so very plain  give the clearest   light   for as they must have been part of the word Arimathaea    they prove that the opinion of Joseph of Arimath a having first   preached the gospel in Britain was known so early as in the second   century  and so decide that long contested point   as  who can   be such an infidel as to doubt a thing given thus  as I may say  under   the sacred seal of the mitre  and that so very near the time          Very true   but is it not as probable that the design of this   writing was to refute that opinion  as to confirm it           My good sir  if you allow weight to such trivial objections as this    you give up all the knowledge of an antiquarian  which never   amounts higher than to possible conjecture  without regard to   probability even against him   for conjectures such as this  founded   on effaced remains of antiquity  are of much greater weight in the   learned world  because they show more learning than the plainest   conclusions drawn from evident and complete records  as these are   obvious to any common person  But  why do I mention these   things to you  who understand them so much better than I pretend   to do         I believe I do  sir  know something of those matters   and was   satisfied both of its antiquity and importance  at the first glance   of my eye   though I started that objection for mere amusement    But where is the fragment   I should be glad to see that also          Here it is  sir    answered my master  taking a bit of broken   copper out of a box  in which it was carefully wrapped in cotton      This plate of copper was torn in the manner you see  from the head   of a sepulchral monument  on the top of Mount Libanus  by a person   who had been sent thither by a celebrated society  on purpose to   seek for such things   and at his return made me a present of it    as the most valuable acquisition he had made  out of gratitude for   my having helped him to the job  Observe this canker  sir  Much   as it has been rubbed off in the carriage  the depth and colour of it   show that it must have been some thousands of years in gathering    What the occasion of setting it up was  some particular circum    stances direct to a conjecture sufficiently probable  You see this
