and  by means of a happy disposition  so far  overcame her chagrin at his indifference  that she was able to behave in  his presence with apparent tranquility and ease  She was even pleased  to find he had  by accident  chosen a time for his visit when she was  surrounded by two or three young gentlemen  who professed themselves her  admirers  Our gallant was no sooner announced  than she collected all  her coquetry  put on the gayest air she could assume  and contrived  to giggle just as he appeared at the room door  The compliments of  salutation being performed  she welcomed him to England in a careless  manner  asked the news of Paris  and  before he could make any reply   desired one of the other gentlemen to proceed with the sequel of that  comical adventure  in the relation of which he had been interrupted   Peregrine smiled within himself at this behaviour  which  without all  doubt  he believed she had affected to punish him for his unkind silence  while he was abroad  being fully persuaded that her heart was absolutely  at his devotion  On this supposition  he practised his Parisian  improvements on the art of conversation  and uttered a thousand  prettinesses in the way of compliment  with such incredible rotation of  tongue  that his rivals were struck dumb with astonishment  and Emilia  fretted out of all temper  at seeing herself deprived of the prerogative  of the sex  He persisted  however  in this surprising loquacity  until  the rest of the company thought proper to withdraw  and then contracted    6 22 15  3 45 PM   his discourse into the focus of love  which now put on a very different  appearance from that which it had formerly worn  Instead of awful  veneration  which her presence used to inspire  that chastity of  sentiment  and delicacy of expression  he now gazed upon her with the  eyes of a libertine  he glowed with the impatience of desire  talked in  a strain that barely kept within the bounds of decency  and attempted  to snatch such favours  as she  in the tenderness of mutual  acknowledgments  had once vouchsafed to bestow   Grieved and offended as she was  at this palpable alteration in his  carriage  she disdained to remind him of his former deportment  and   with dissembled good humour  rallied him on the progress he had made  in gallantry and address  But  far from submitting to the liberties he  would have taken  she kept her person sacred from his touch  and would  not even suffer him to ravish a kiss of her fair hand  so that he  reaped no other advantage from the exercise of his talents  during  this interview  which lasted a whole hour  than that of knowing he had  overrated his own importance  and that Emily s heart was not a garrison  likely to surrender at discretion   At length his addresses were interrupted by the arrival of the mother   who had gone abroad to visit by herself  and the conversation becoming  more general  he understood that Godfrey was at London  soliciting for a  lieutenancy that had fallen vacant in the regiment to which he belonged   and that Miss Sophy was at home with her father   Though our adventurer had not met with all the success he expected by  his first visit  he did not despair of reducing the fortress  believing  that in time there would be a mutiny in his favour  and accordingly  carried on the siege for several days  without profiting by his  perseverance  till  at length  having attended the ladies to their  own house in the country  he began to look upon this adventure as time  misspent  and resolved to discontinue his attack  in hopes of meeting  with a more favourable occasion  being  in the meantime  ambitious of  displaying in a higher sphere  those qualifications which his vanity  told him were at present misapplied   CHAPTER LXVIII   He attends his Uncle with great Affection during a Fit of Illness  Sets  out again for London  Meets with his Friend Godfrey  who is prevailed  upon to accompany him to Bath  on the Road to which Place they chance  to Dine with a Person who entertains them with a curious Account of a  certain Company of Adventurers   Thus determined  he took leave of Emilia and her mother  on pretence of  going to London upon some urgent business  and returned to the garrison   leaving the good old lady very much concerned  and the daughter incensed  at his behaviour  which was the more unexpected  because Godfrey had  told them that the commodore approved of his nephew s passion   Our adventurer found his uncle so ill of the gout  which  for the first    6 22 15  3 45 PM   time  had taken possession of his stomach  that his life was in imminent  danger  and the whole family in disorder  He therefore took the reins  of government in his own hands  sent for all the physicians in the  neighbourhood  and
