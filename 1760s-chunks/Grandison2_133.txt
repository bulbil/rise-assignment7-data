  They had been educated  as I have said  at his expence  and  in the phrase of business  well put out  Expences their careless father would not have been at  He is  in every light  a bad man  How much better had these children s title been to a more considerable part of their uncle s estate than he has bequeathed to them  had they been thankful for the benefits they had actually received  Benefits  which are of such a nature  that they cannot be taken from them   Mr  Danby has bequeathed to each of the three  one thousand pounds  but on express condition  that they signify to his executor  within two months after his demise  their acceptance of it  in full of all demands upon his estate  If they do not  tender being duly made  the three thousand pounds are to be carried to the uses of the will   He then appoints his executor  and makes him residuary legatee  giving for reason  that he had been the principal instrument in the hand of Providence  of saving his life   He bequeaths some generous remembrances to three of his friends in France  and requests his executor to dispose of three thousand pounds to charitable uses  either in France or England  as he thinks fit  and to what particular objects he pleases   And  by an inventory annexed to the will  his effects in money  bills  actions  and jewels  are made to amount to upwards of thirty thousand pounds sterling   Mr  Sylvester complimented me on this great windfall  as he called it  and assured me  that it should be his advice to his clients  that each take his and   333 her legacy  and sit down contented with it  And he believed  that they the rather would  as  from what their uncle had hinted  they apprehended  that the sum of an hundred pounds each  was all they had to hope for   I enquired into the inclinations and views of the three  and received a very good general account of them  with an hint  that the girl was engaged in a Love affair   Their father  after his vile attempt upon his brother s life  was detested by all his friends and relations  and went abroad  and the last news they heard of him  was  that he was in a very ill state of health  and in unhappy circumstances  in Barbadoes  And very probably by this time is no more   I desired Mr  Sylvester to advise the young people to recollect themselves  and said  That I had a disposition to be kind to them  And as he could give me only general accounts of their views  prospects  and engagements  I wish d they would  with marks of confidence in me  give me particular ones  But that  whether they complimented me as I wished  or not  I was determined  for the sake of their uncle s memory  to do all reasonable services to them  Tell them  in a word  Mr  Sylvester  and do you forgive the seeming vanity  That I am not accustomed to suffer the narrowness of other people s hearts to contract mine   The man went away  very much pleased with what I had said  and in about two hours  sent me a note  in the names of all his clients  expressing gratitude and obligation  and requesting me to allow him to introduce them all three to me this afternoon   I have some necessary things to do  and persons to see  in relation to my deceased friend  which will be dispatched over a dish of tea  And therefore I have invited the honest attorney  and his three clients  to sup with me     334 I will not send this to Colnebrooke  where I hope you are all happy  All must  for are they not all good  And are not you with them   till I accompany it with the result of this evening s conversation  Yet I am too fond of every occasion that offers to tell you  what  however  you cannot doubt  how much I am yours  not to sign to that truth the name of  CHARLES GRANDISON   LETTER XXXV  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  In Continuation   Friday night  March 17   MR  Sylvester  an honest pleasure shining in his countenance  presented to me  first  Miss Danby  then  each of her brothers  who all received my welcome with a little consciousness  as if they had something to reproach themselves with  and were generously ashamed to be overcome  The sister had the least of it  And I saw by that  that she was the least blameable  not the least modest  since I dare say she had but followed her brothers lead  while they looked down and bashful  as having all that was done amiss to answer for   Miss Danby is a very pretty  and very genteel young woman  Mr  Thomas and Mr  Edward Danby  are agreeable in their persons and manners  and want not sense   In the first moment I dissipated all their uneasiness  and we sat down together
