England  before Sir Walter Watkyns desired my interest with my sister  I told him  That she was entirely her own mistress  and that I should not offer to lead her choice  Lord G  made his court to her likewise  and applying to me  received the same answer   I enter d  however  into serious talk with my sister upon this subject  She ask d me what I thought of each gentleman  I told her frankly   Miss Gr  And pray  brother be so good as to repeat what you said of them  Let Miss Byron be judge whether either of the portraits was very inviting   Sir Ch  I told her  Miss Byron  that Sir Walter would  I presumed  be thought the handsomer man of the two  He was gay  lively  genteel  and had that courage in his air and manner  that Ladies were seldom displeased with  I had not  however  discovered any great depth in him  My sister  I imagined  if she married him  would have the superiority in good sense  But I question d whether Sir Walter would easily find that out  or allow it  if he did  He   260 was a brisk man for an hour  and might have wit and sense too  but indeed I hardly ever saw him out of Ladies company  and he seemed to be of opinion  that flash rather than fire  was what would recommend him to them  Sometimes I have thought  I told her  that women of sense should punish such men with their contempt  and not reward them with their approbation  for thus indirectly affronting their understandings  But that I had known women of sense approve a man of that character  and each woman must determine for herself  what appeared most agreeable to her   Miss Gr   whispering  Well  Harriet—  Har   whispering  Don t interrupt him   Sir Ch  You remember  my dear Charlotte  that it was in this kind of way I spoke about Sir Walter Watkyns  and added  That he was independent  in possession of the family estate  which I believed was a good one  and that he talked handsomely to me of settlements   I do remember this  said Miss Grandison  and whispering me  I am afraid  said she  he knows too much  but the person he cannot know —Well  Sir  and pray be pleased to repeat what you said of Lord G   Sir Ch  Lord G  told you  was a gay dressing man  but of a graver cast than the other  The fashion  rather than his inclination  seemed to govern his outward appearance  He was a modest man  and I feared had too much doubt of himself to appear with that dignity in the eye of a lively woman  which should give him a first consequence with her   Miss Gr  Your servant  Sir   Sir Ch  I believed he would make a good husband  So perhaps might Sir Walter  But the one would bear  and the other perhaps must be borne with  Ladies  as well as men  I presumed  had some soibles  that they would not care to part with  As to fortune  I added    261 that Lord G  was dependent on his father s pleasure  He had  indeed  his father s entire approbation  I found  in his address  And I hoped that a sister of mine would not wish for any man s death  for the sake of either title or fortune  You have seen Lord G  Miss Byron   Har  What  Sir Charles  was Miss Grandison s answer   I did not care to give any opinion  that might either hurt or humour my Charlotte   Sir Ch  Charlotte told me  in so many words  That she did not approve of either  Each gentleman  said I  has besought me to be his advocate  A task that I have not undertaken  I only told them  That I would talk to my sister upon the subject  But did not think a brother ought to expect an influence over a sister  where the gentlemen suspected their own  You will remember  said I to my sister  that women cannot choose where they will  and that the same man cannot be every thing—She desired me to tell her  which of the two I would prefer —First  said I▪ let me repeat the question I have more than once put to you—Have you any the least shadow of a preference in your heart  to any third person —What was my sister s answer  She said  She had not  And yet  had I not had the private intelligence I hinted at  I should have been apt to imagine  that I had some reason to repeat the question  from the warmth  both of manner and accent  with which she declared  that she approved of neither  Women  I believe  do not  with earnestness  reject a man who is not quite disagreeable  and to whose quality and fortune there can be no objection  if they are absolutely unprejudiced in another s favour   We women look d upon one another
