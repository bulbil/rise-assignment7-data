with towards   a Man of his age  his quality  and above all  the father of Charlotta    not a little contributed       The lovers had now frequent opportunities of entertaining each other   both at Paris and St  Germains  nor were any of those demonstrations   which virtue and innocence permitted  wanting between them  to render   them as perfectly easy as people can possibly be  who have yet something   to desire  and much to fear  But as smooth as now their fortune seemed    they knew not how soon a storm might rise  and give a sudden   interruption to that felicity they enjoyed   The charms of Charlotta   were every day making new conquests  and among the number of those who   pretended to admire her  how probable was it that some one might be   thought worthy by her father  and she be compelled to receive the   addresses of a rival  These were reflections too natural not to occur to   them both  and whenever they did  could not fail of embittering those   sweets the certainty of a mutual affection had otherwise afforded       They had now no trouble from monsieur de Coigney  his father  in order   to make him forget a hopeless passion  had found an employment for him   which obliged him to go many leagues from Paris  and once the   conversation already mentioned at the baron s  his sister and   mademoiselle Charlotta  by command of their respective parents  as well   as their own inclinations  broke off all correspondence  nor even spoke   to each other  unless when happening to meet in a visit  there was no   avoiding it  and then it was in such a distant manner  and with so much   indifference  that none would have imagined they ever had been intimate   friends and companions             CHAP  IX        A second separation between Horatio and Charlotta  with some other   occurrences        The season of the year now having put an end to the campaign  and the   French  as well as confederate armies  being retired into their winter   quarters  the baron de la Valiere  who had always a special permission   from the general  returned to Paris  Horatio promised himself much   satisfaction in the renewed society of this friend  and no sooner heard   he was on the road than he went to meet him  The baron  charm d with   this proof of his affection and respect  received him as a brother  and   there was little less freedom used between them       After the mutual testimonies and good will were over de la Valiere began   to ask him concerning mademoiselle Charlotta  on which Horatio   acquainted him with her being removed from St  Germains  and the   occasion of it  not omitting the arrogance with which old monsieur de   Coigney had behaved to her father  and the resentment now between   the families       Well  said the baron  but I hope you have been more successful  at least   with the young lady  I will never more trust the intelligence of eyes    if yours did not hold a very tender intercourse  and I protest to you    my dear Horatio  that amidst all the toils and dangers of war  my   thoughts were often at St  Germains  not envying  but congratulating the   pleasures you enjoyed in the conversation of that amiable lady       I doubt not  replied Horatio with a smile  but we had you with us at a   place which contained mademoiselle de Coigney  and I am of opinion too   she was no less frequently in the camp with you  for in spite of all the   reserve she affected while you were present  she never heard the bare   mention of your name without emotions  which were very visible in her   countenance       I would not be vain  replied the baron  but I sometimes have flattered   myself with the hope I was not altogether indifferent to her  tho  for   two whole years that I have constantly made my addresses to her  I never   could obtain one soft confession to assure my happiness   but let me   know how you have proceeded on the score of mademoiselle Charlotta    believe me  I am not so engrossed by my own affairs  as not to give   attention to those of a friend       Horatio  who had been engaged by Charlotta to preserve an inviolable   secrecy in every thing that had passed between them  without any   exception of persons  would fain have turned the conversation on some   other topic  he truly loved the baron  had the highest opinion of his   discretion  and would
