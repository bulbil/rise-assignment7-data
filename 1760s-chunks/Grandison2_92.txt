him  I suppose  yet knew not how to help it  He found fault with Sir Thomas  Sir Charles told him  That it was a very ingrateful thing to him to hear his father spoken slightly of  He desired his Lordship to forbear reflections of that sort  My father  said he  is no more  I desire not to be made a party in any disputes that may have happen d between him and your Lordship  I come to attend you as a duty which I owe to my mother s memory  and I hope this may be done without wounding that of my father   You say well  said my Lord  but I am afraid  kinsman  by your air and manner  and speech too  that you want not your father s proud spirit   I revere my father for his spirit  my Lord  It might not always be exerted as your Lordship  and his other relations  might wish  But he had a manly one  As to myself  I will help your Lordship to my character at once  I am  indeed  a very proud man  I cannot stoop to slatter  and  least of all men  the great and rich  Finding it difficult to restrain this fault  it is my whole study to direct it to laudable ends  and I hope  that I am too proud to do anything unworthy of my father s name  or of my mother s virtue   Why  Sir   and look d at him again from head to foot  your father never in his whole life said so good a thing   Your Lordship knew not my father as he deserved to be known  Where there are misunderstandings between two persons  tho  relations  the character of either is not to be taken from the other  But  my Lord  this is  as I said before  a visit of duty  I have nothing to ask of your Lordship  but your good opinion  and that no longer than I deserve it   My Lord was displeased     You have nothing to ask   230 of me    —repeated he  Let me tell you  independent Sir  that I like not your speech  You may leave me  if you please  And when I want to see you again  I will send for you     Your servant  my Lord  and let me say  that I will not again attend you  till you do  But when you do  the summons of my mother s brother shall be chearfully obeyed  when perhaps this unkind treatment of Lord W  might be remembred   The very next day  my Lord hearing he was still at Windsor  viewing the curiosities of the place  sent to him  He directly went  My Lord expressed himself highly pleased with his readiness to come  and apologized to him for his behaviour of the day before  He called him nephew  and swore  that he was just such a young man as he had wish d to see  Your mother used to say  proceeded he  that you could do what you would with her  should you even be unreasonable  And I beg of you to ask me no favour  but what is fit for me to grant  for fear I should grudge it after I had granted it  and call in question  what no man is willing to do  my own discretion   He then ask d him about the methods he intended to take with regard to his way of life  Sir Charles answered  That he was resolved to dispose of his racers  hunters  and dogs  as soon as he could  That he would take a survey of the timber upon his estate  and fell that which would be the worse for standing  and doubted not but that a part of it in Hampshire would turn to good account  But that he would plant an oakling for every oak he cut down  for the sake of posterity  He was determined  he said  to let the house in Essex  and even to sell the estate there  if it were necessary  to clear incumbrances  and to pay off the mortgage upon the Irish estate  which he had a notion was very improvable   What did he propose to do for his sisters  who were left  he found  absolutely in his power     231 Marry them  my Lord  as soon as I can  I have a good opinion of Lord L  My elder sister loves him  I will enquire what will make him easy  And easy I will make him  on his marriage with her  if it be in my power  I will endeavour to make the younger happy too  And when these two points are settled  but not before  because I will not deceive the family with which I may engage  I will think of myself   Bravo  bravo  said my Lord  and his eyes  that were brimful some moments before  then ran over  As I hope to be saved  I had a good mind to—to—to—And there he stopt   I ask only for your approbation  my Lord  or correction if wrong  My father has
