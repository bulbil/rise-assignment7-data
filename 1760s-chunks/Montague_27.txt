manner of leaving it must appear extraordinary to my friends  I have therefore made this estate my excuse  I have written to Miss Fermor that I am going to make a purchase  have begged my warmest wishes to her lovely friend  for whose happiness no one on earth is more anxious  but have told her Sir George is too much the object of my envy  to expect from me very sincere congratulations       Adieu  my servant waits for this  You shall hear an account of my adventures when I return to Quebec   Yours   ED  RIVERS     LETTER XXVIII   28   To Miss FERMOR  at Silleri   Quebec  Oct  7  twelve o clock   I MUST see you  my dear  this evening  my mind is in an agitation not to be expressed  a few hours will determine my happiness or misery for ever  I am displeased with your father for precipitating a determination which cannot be made with too much caution       I have a thousand things to say to you  which I can say to no one else       Be at home  and alone  I will come to you as soon as dinner is over       Adieu   Your affectionate  EMILY MONTAGUE     LETTER XXIX   29   To Miss MONTAGUE  at Quebec   I WILL be at home  my dear  and denied to every body but you       I pity you  my dear Emily  but I am unable to give you advice       The world would wonder at your hesitating a moment   Your faithful  A  FERMOR     LETTER XXX   30   To Miss FERMOR  at Silleri   Quebec  Oct  7  three o clock   MY visit to you is prevented by an event beyond my hopes  Sir George has this moment a letter from his mother  desiring him earnestly to postpone his marriage till spring  for some reasons of consequence to his fortune  with the particulars of which she will acquaint him by the next packet       He communicated this intelligence to me with a grave air  but with a tranquillity not to be described  and I received it with a joy I found it impossible wholly to conceal       I have now time to consult both my heart and my reason at leisure  and to break with him  if necessary  by degrees       What an escape have I had  I was within four and twenty hours of either determining to marry a man with whom I fear I have little chance to be happy  or of breaking with him in a manner that would have subjected one or both of us to the censures of a prying impertinent world  whose censures the most steady temper cannot always contemn       I will own to you  my dear  I every hour have more dread of this marriage  his present situation has brought his faults into full light  Captain Clayton  with little more than his commission  was modest  humble  affable to his inferiors  polite to all the world  and I fancied him possessed of those more active virtues  which I supposed the smallness of his fortune prevented from appearing   Tis with pain I see that Sir George  with a splendid income  is avaricious  selfish  proud  vain  and profuse  lavish to every caprice of vanity and ostentation which regards himself  coldly inattentive to the real wants of others       Is this a character to make your Emily happy  We were not formed for each other  no two minds were ever so different  my happiness is in friendship  in the tender affections  in the sweets of dear domestic life  his in the idle parade of affluence  in dress  in equipage  in all that splendor  which  whilst it excites envy  is too often the mark of wretchedness       Shall I say more  Marriage is seldom happy where there is a great disproportion of fortune  The lover  after he loses that endearing character in the husband  which in common minds I am afraid is not long  begins to reflect how many more thousands he might have expected  and perhaps suspects his mistress of those interested motives in marrying  of which he now feels his own heart capable  Coldness  suspicion  and mutual want of esteem and confidence  follow of course       I will come back with you to Silleri this evening  I have no happiness but when I am with you  Mrs  Melmoth is so fond of Sir George  she is eternally persecuting me with his praises  she is extremely mortified at this delay  and very angry at the manner in which I behave upon it        Come to us directly  my dear Bell  and rejoice with your faithful  EMILY MONTAGUE     LETTER XXXI   31   To Miss MONTAGUE  at Quebec   I CONGRATULATE you  my dear  you will at least have the pleasure of being five or six months longer your own mistress  which  in my opinion  when one is not violently in love  is a consideration worth attending to  You will also have
