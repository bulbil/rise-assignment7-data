to him   I believe  Madam  said he  though you do not remember me  that you cannot be ignorant of your having had a relation of the name of Warner  who went to the West Indies about five and twenty years ago  I answered  I do remember to have heard of such a person   You see that unfortunate man before you  he replied  I am your near relation  Madam  your father was my mother’s only brother  I have been very unhappy  I lost  in my return to England  what almost five and twenty years industry had scraped together  the sum was but a moderate one  yet sufficient to have supported me decently for the remainder of my life  I asked him  how it happened  I began  said he  to grow sickly abroad  and was told that my native air might restore me  This advice so well agreed with my own inclinations  which were  for a long time past  bent upon returning home  that I took the first opportunity of a ship bound for England  but we were unluckily met by a French privateer  who stripped me of every thing but the clothes on my back  and set me on shore on the coast of Spain  whence I begged my passage to England  having nothing to support me but a few shillings  part of a collection  made for me and my fellow sufferers  amongst some English gentlemen   Whilst he spoke I thought I could discover a likeness in his face to my father  He was reckoned extremely to resemble his sister  the mother of this unhappy Mr Warner  she was a fine woman  and I had seen her picture  His story was credible  and I had no reason to doubt the truth of what he said   And here I will give you a brief account of what occasioned this unfortunate relation to be thus long an alien from his family   His mother  as you have just now heard  was my father’s sister  who threw her person and her fortune away upon a broken officer  This act disobliged my father so much  that from the time of her marriage  to the hour of her death  he never would see her  Her husband died  when this their only child was about nine years old  the poor mother survived him but a short time  and the orphan boy was left to my father’s mercy  I have often heard him say he was very unlucky  and never could be persuaded into a love of his book  he was  however  put to school  and my father bestowed the same    expence on his education  as if he had been his own son  When he was about sixteen years old  as he wrote a good hand  and had a great capacity for figures  he bound him apprentice to a merchant  in which situation he had been above a year   and during that time he had made several elopements  and was with difficulty reconciled to his master  through my father’s mediation  when he committed such a misdemeanour in his master’s family as obliged him to abscond  Accordingly he stole  unknown to any body  on board a ship bound to the West Indies  of which his master was partly owner  where he hid himself  and nobody could tell what was become of him  ’till my father  about nine months after his departure  received a letter from him  dated from Jamaica  wherein he begged pardon of him  and his master  for his elopement  told him  that he had been taken into a merchant’s compting house  and declared  that he meant  by his diligence and good behaviour  to make amends for his past ill conduct  This was the only letter my father or any of his friends ever had from him  He answered it  but had no return  nor could he  from repeated enquiries  made two or three years after  learn any thing of him  so that all his relations concluded him dead   These particulars I had heard before from my father  and his relations perfectly agreeing with them in every circumstance  I could have no doubt but that he was the man  Sir  said I  I very well remember to have heard your story  your likeness to my father  who was the image of your mother  leaves me no room to question your being the Mr Warner  of whom I have so often heard  you are indeed my near relation  and it grieves my heart to see you in such distress  and the more so  as I have not the ability I could wish to assist you  but we will talk over more particulars after breakfast  I rang the bell  and ordered Patty to get some coffee  While we were at breakfast  I asked my new found kinsman by what means he had discovered me so soon   for  by the way  I should have told you that he said he had been arrived but two days in London   He answered  that one of the English gentlemen  who had been so kind to him at Cadiz  had given him a letter to a gentleman in London  for whom he was to leave it
