 in whatever manner they affected us   He applauded me  and said  That I wanted so little to be a Catholic  that it was a thousand pities I was not one  And he was persuaded  that I should one day be a proselyte   This Father s business was  to convince me of the unfitness of an alliance between families so very opposite in their religious sentiments  He went into history upon it  You may believe  that the unhappy consequences which follow the marriage between our Charles I  and the Princess Henrietta of France  were not forgotten  He expatiated upon them  but I observed to him  That the Monarch was the sufferer  by the zeal of the Queen for her religion  and not the Queen  any otherwise than as she was involved in the consequences of those sufferings which she had brought upon him  In short  Father  said I  We Protestants  some of us  have zeal  but let us alone  and it is not a persecuting one  Your doctrine of merits makes the zeal of your devotees altogether active  and perhaps the more flaming  in proportion as the person is more honest and worthy   I lamented  that I was sent for from Vienna  upon   319 hopes  tho  my principles were well known  that otherwise I had never presumed to entertain   He owned that that was a wrong step  and valued himself that he had not been consulted upon it  And that when he knew it had been taken  he inveighed against it   And I am afraid  Father  said I—  He interrupted me—Why  I believe so —You have made such generous distinctions in favour of the duty of a man acting in my function  that  I must own  I have not been an idle observer on this occasion   He advised me to quit Bologna  He was profuse in his offers of service in any other affair  and  I dare say  was in earnest   I told him  That I chose not to leave it precipitately  and as if I had done something blame worthy  I had some hopes of being recalled to my father s arms  I should set out  when I left Bologna  directly for Paris  to be in the way of such a long wished for call  and then  said I  Adieu to travelling  Adieu to Italy  for ever  I should have been happy  had I never seen it  but in the way for which I have been accustomed to censure the generality of my countrymen   His behaviour at parting was such  as will make me for ever revere him  and will enlarge a charity for all good men of his religion  which yet  before  was not a narrow one  For  begging my excuse  he kneeled down at the door of my antechamber  and offered up  in a very servent manner  a prayer for my conversion  He could not have given me  any other way  so high an opinion of him  No  not  had he offered me his interest with Clementina  and her family  I embraced him  as he did me  Tears were in his eyes  I thanked him for the favour of this visit  and  recommending myself to his frequent prayers  told him  That he might be assured of all the respectful services he should put it in my power to render   320 him  I longed  Dr  Bartlett  to make him a present worthy of his acceptance  had I known what would have been acceptable  and had I not been afraid of affronting him  I accompanied him to the outward door  I never  said he  saw a Protestant that I loved  before  Your mind is still more amiable than your person  Lady Clementina  I see  might have been happy with you  But it was not fit  on our side  He snatched my hand  before I was aware  and honoured it with his lips  and hastened from me  leaving me at a loss  and looking after him  and for him  when he was out of sight  my mind labouring as under a high sense of obligation to his goodness   Religion and Love  Dr  Bartlett  which heighten our relish for the things of both worlds  What pity is it  that they should ever run the human heart either into enthusiasm  or superstition  and thereby debase the minds they are both so well fitted to exalt   I am equally surprised and affected by the contents of the following Letter  directed to me  It was put within the door  nobody saw by whom  The daughter of the Lady at whose house I lodge  found it  and gave it to one of my servants for me   DON T be surprised  Chevalier  don t think amiss of me for my forwardness  I heard some words drop  so did Camilla  but she can t go out to tell you of them  as if somebody s life was in danger  This distracts me  I am not treated as I was accustomed to be treated  They don t love me now—They don t love their poor Clementina  Very
