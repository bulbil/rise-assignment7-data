none present but themselves ever heard  but all tending to shew how much they were valued by the best gentry in Caermarthenshire   The knight then related a conversation that had once passed between himself and the late Lord Mansell  in which that nobleman had complimented him on an estate of a clear 3000 l  a year  besides a good deal of ready cash  and with supposing that he would set up his nephew when at age  for it was some years ago  as a representative for the county  And he repeated the prudent answer he gave his Lordship  disavowing such a design  as no better than a gaming propensity  as he called it  which had ruined many a fair estate   This sort of talk  in which his nephew could bear a part  and indeed they had it all between them  held the tea time  and then having given themselves the   100 consequence they had seemed to intend  the knight  drawing his chair nearer me  and winking to his nephew  who withdrew  began to set forth the young gentleman s good qualities  to declare the passion he had for me  and to beg my encouragement of so worthy  so proper  and so well favoured a young man  who was to be his sole heir  and for whom he would do such things  on my account  as  during his life  he would not do for any other woman breathing   There was no answering a discourse so serious with the air of levity  which it was hardly possible to avoid assuming  on the first visit of the knight   I was vexed that I found myself almost as bashful  as silly  and as silent  as if I had thoughts of encourageing Mr  Fowler s addresses  My cousins seemed pleased with my bashfulness  The knight  I once thought  by the tone of his voice and his hum  would have struck up a Welsh tune  and danced for joy   Shall I call in my kinsman  madam  to confirm all I have said  and to pour out the whole soul at your feet  My boy is bashful  But a little favour from that sweet countenance will make a man of him  Let me  let me  call in my boy  I will go for him myself  and was going   Let me say one word  Sir Rowland—before Mr  Fowler comes in—before you speak to him—You have explained yourself unexceptionably  I am obliged to you and Mr  Fowler for your good opinion  But this can never be   How  madam  can never be —I will allow that you shall take time for half a dozen visits  or so  that you may be able to judge of my nephew s qualities and understanding  and be convinced from his own mouth  and heart and soul  as I may say  of his Love for you  No need of time for him  He  poor man  is fixed  immoveably fixed  But say you will take a week s time  or so  to consider what you can do  what you will do—And that s all I at present crave  or indeed  madam  can allow you     101 I cannot doubt now  Sir Rowland  of what my mind will be a week hence  as to this matter   How  madam —Why we are all in the suds then —Why  Mr  Reeves  Mrs  Reeves —Whew  with an half whistle—Why  madam  we shall  at this rate  be all untwisted —But  after a pause  by Mercy I will not be thus answered —Why  madam  would you have the conscience to break my poor boy s heart —Come  be as gracious as you look to be—Give me your hand— He snatched my hand  In respect to his years I withdrew it not  And give my boy your heart —Sweet soul  Such sensible  such good natured mantlings —Why you can t be cruel  if you would —Dear Lady  Say you will take a little time to consider of this matter  Don t repeat those cruel words   It can never be  —What have you to object to my boy   Mr  Fowler  both by character and appearance  Sir Rowland  is a worthy man  He is a modest man  and modesty—  Well  and so he is—Mercy  I was afraid that his modesty would be an objection—  It cannot  Sir Rowland  with a modest woman  I love  I revere  a modest man  But  indeed  I cannot give hope  where I mean not to encourage any   Your objection  madam  to my nephew—You must have seen something in him you dislike   I do not easily dis like  Sir  but then I do not easily like  And I never will marry any man  to whom I cannot be more than indifferent   Why  madam  he adores you—He—  That  Sir  is an objection  unless I could return his Love  My gratitude would be endangered   Excellent notions —With these notions  madam  you could not be ungrateful   That  Sir  is a risque I will never run  How many bad wives are
