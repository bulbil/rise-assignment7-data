They had not gone many paces  before an   arbour  erected between two of these venerable monuments of antiquity    and overspread with jessamines and honeysuckles  attracted Mrs  Munden s   eyes   Oh  how delightful is this   said she   It would have been much   more so  Madam  if it had been placed on the other side of the walk     said the gentlewoman   and  if I live till next spring  will have the   position of it altered  You will presently see my reasons for it     continued she   if you please to turn your eyes a little to the right     Mrs  Munden doing as she was desired  had the prospect of a very   beautiful garden  decorated with plots of flowers  statues  and trees   cut in a most elegant manner   Does all this belong to you   demanded   she  somewhat surprized   No  Madam   answered the other   but they are   part of the same estate  and  at present  rented by a gentleman of   condition  who lives at the next door  The walk we are in is also common   to us both  each having a gate to enter it at pleasure  though  indeed    they little frequent it  having much finer of their own   With such like   chat they beguiled the time  till the evening dew reminded them it was   best to quit the open air       Mrs  Munden passed this night in more tranquillity than she had done   many preceding ones  she awoke  however  much sooner than was her   custom  and  finding herself less disposed to return to the embraces of   sleep than to partake that felicity she heard a thousand chearful birds   tuning their little throats in praise of  she rose  and went down into   the garden  the contemplative humour she was in  led her to the arbour   she had been so much charmed with the night before  she threw herself   upon the mossy seat  where scenting the fragrancy of the sweets around   her  made more delicious by the freshness of the morning s gale   How   delightful  how heavenly   said she to herself   is this solitude  how   truly preferable to all the noisy  giddy pleasures  of the tumultuous   town  yet how have I despised and ridiculed the soft sincerity of a   country life   Then recollecting some discourse she formerly had with   Mr  Trueworth on that subject   I wonder   cried she   what Mr    Trueworth would say if he knew the change that a little time has wrought   in me  he would certainly find me now more deserving of his friendship   than ever he could think me of his love  but he is ignorant  insensible    of my real sentiments  and if Sir Bazil and Lady Loveit should tell him   with what abruptness I fled their house at the news of his approach  I   must appear in his eyes the most vain  stupid  thankless  creature I   once was  But  such is my unhappy situation  that I dare not even wish   he should discover what passes in my heart  the just sensibility of his   amiable qualities  and of the services he has done me  which would once   have been meritorious in me to have avowed  would now be highly   criminal        With these reflections she took out Mr  Trueworth s picture  which she   always carried about her  and  looking on it with the greatest   tenderness   Though I no more must see himself   said she   I may  at   least  be allowed to pay the tribute of my gratitude to this dumb   representative of the man to whom I have been so much obliged   At this   instant  a thousand proofs of love given her by the original of the copy   in her hand  occurring all at once to her remembrance  tears filled her   eyes  and her breast swelled with involuntary sighs       In this painfully pleasing amusement did she continue for some time  and   had  doubtless  done so much longer  if a sudden rustling among the   leaves behind her  had not made her turn her head to see what had   occasioned it  but where are the words that can express the surprize    the wild confusion  she was in  when the first glance of her eyes   presented her with the sight of the real object  whose image she had   been thus tenderly contemplating  She shrieked  the picture dropped   from her hand  the use of her faculties forsook her  she sunk from the   seat where she was sitting  and had certainly fainted quite away but for
