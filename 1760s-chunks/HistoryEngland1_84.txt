the streets were strewed  the walls were hung  the conduits ran with wine  while she and her corpulent lover rode through the city like the heroine and knight of a romance   In the mean time the Pope now thought himself obliged to hold no measures with the King  and  being also frighted by the menaces of the Emperor  published a sentence  declaring Queen Catharine alone to be Henry s lawful wife  and requiring him to take her again  with a denunciation of censures in case of a refusal  When Henry received news of the sentence given against him at Rome  he was convinced that no measures could be kept   246 with the Holy See  and therefore no longer delayed to execute his long meditated scheme of separating entirely from the church of Rome  The parliament was at his devotion  a part of the clergy was for him  as they had already declared against the Pope  when they decreed in favour of the divorce  the people were flattered with the expectation of being rid of the burden of their taxes  and such as were displeased to see Italian Bishops hold English church preferments  expected their downfall  in short  all things conspired to co operate with his designs  he  therefore  at once ordered himself to be declared  by his clergy  head of the church  The parliament confirmed his title  and abolished all the authority of the Pope in England  the tribute of Peter pence  and the collation to ecclesiastical benefices  The people came into the King s project with joy  and took an oath  called the oath of supremacy  all the credit of the Pope  that had subsisted for ages  was now at once overthrown  and few  except those who held to the religious houses  seemed dissatisfied  They who believed that it would have been dangerous to break with the Pope  were now convinced that it could be effected with impunity  and it was soon perceived  that all authority  which is not supported by power  is nothing but an empty name   I am   c     247  LETTER XXXI   IN this manner began the reformation in England  and by such surprising methods Providence brought about its designs  as if to mock human sagacity  Let us now pursue its progress  and follow this capricious Monarch through his various projects  cruelties  and inconsistencies  The parliament were now entirely dependant upon the King  they had  from the beginning  sided with him in his separating from the church of Rome  and consequently were now obliged to comply with all his other measures  in order to strengthen the new reformation   Henry was very sensible that the parliament was now  even from motives of interest  entirely dedevoted to him  and therefore he was resolved to make use of the opportunity  and render himself absolute  He therefore opposed the parliament against the monks  and availed himself of the hatred which that body incurred by their suppression  the parliament at first began by examining the abuses practised in monasteries  and  finding some  condemned all  but  while they were employed in suppressing them  Henry was busy in destroying the power of the suppressors  This was the origin of the unlimitted power he now assumed  his parliament  at different times  passed every statute he thought proper to propose  how absurd soever  and many of them were  in fact  marked with the highest absurdities  They testified their satisfaction  not only for what he had done  but also for whatever he intended to do  They enacted  that the same obedience should be paid to the King s proclamation as to an act of   248 parliament  which was destroying all their power at one blow  they declared their readiness to believe  not only what had been directed  but whatever the King should direct  in matters of religion  for the future  but  to crown all  they enacted that the King should not pay his debts  and that such as had been paid by him  should refund the money   Being thus impowered to act as he thought proper  he went vigorously to work in the suppression of monasteries  colleges  and religious houses  Cambridge and Oxford  without any regard to their antiquity  shared the same fate with the rest  and the lectures were  for a time  discontinued  and the revenues confiscated  To reconcile the people to these proceedings  Henry took care to have the counterseit reliques exposed  the scandalous lives of the friars and nuns made public  and all their debaucheries detected  Whatever had served to engage the people in superstition  was publicly burnt  but what grieved the people most to see  were  the bones of Thomas Becket  the saint of Canterbury  treated with the same severity  burnt in public  and his rich shrine  in which there was a diamond of great value  confiscated among the common plunder  The people looked on with silent horror  afraid to rebel  equally detesting the vices of the monks and the impiety of the King   But  while the King had entirely separated himself from Rome  yet he was by no means willing to be a follower of Luther  The invocation of saints was not yet abolished by him
