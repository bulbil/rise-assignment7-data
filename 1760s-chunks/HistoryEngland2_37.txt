be reckoned the final effort of France by sea  in all subsequent engagements their chief care was rather to consult means of escape than of victory  Nor yet were the French and Spaniards willing to suffer Gibraltar to be taken  without an effort for reprisal  Philip sent an army to retake it  and France a fleet of thirteen ships of the line  both were equally unsuccessful  part of the fleet was dispersed by a tempest  and another part taken by the English  while the army  having made little or no progress by land  was obliged to abandon the enterprize   Nor were the English less successful in asserting the title of Charles to the kingdom  Their army was commanded by the Earl of Peterborough  one of the most singular and extraordinary men of the age  At fifteen he fought against the Moors in Africa  at twenty he assisted in compassing the revolution  He now carried on this war in Spain  almost at his own expence  and his friendship for the Duke Charles was his strongest motive to undertake it  He was deformed in person  but  of a mind the most generous and active that ever inspired an honest bosom  His first attempt in Spain was to besiege Barcelona  a strong city  with a garrison of five thousand men  while his own army amounted to but seven thousand  Never was an attempt more bold  or more fortunate  The operations began by a sudden attack on fort Monjuice  strongly situated on an   99 hill  that commanded the city  The outworks were taken by storm  a shell chanced to fall into the body of the fort  and blew up the magazine of powder  the garrison of the fort was struck with consternation  and surrendered without farther resistance  The town still remained unconquered  the English general erected batteries against it  and  in a few days  the governor capitulated  During the interval of capitulation  the Germans and Catalonians in the English army had entered the town  and were plundering all before them  The governor thought himself betrayed  he upbraided the treachery of the general  Peterborough flew among the plunderers  drove them from their prey  and returned soon after cooly to finish the capitulation  The Spaniards were equally amazed at the generosity of the English  and the baseness of their own countrymen  who had led on to the spoil   The conquest of all Valencia succeeded the taking of this important place  the enemy  after a deseated attempt to retake Barcelona  saw themselves deprived of almost every hope  the party of Charles was increasing every day  he became master of Aragon  Carthagena  and Granada  the road to Madrid  their capital city  lay open before him  the Earl of Galloway entered it in triumph  and there proclaimed Charles King of Spain  without farther opposition   The English had scarce time to rejoice at these successes of their arms  when their attention was turned to new victories in Flanders  The Duke of Marlborough had early commenced the campaign  and brought an army of eighty thousand men into the field  and still expected reinforcements from Denmark and Prussia  The court of France wa resolved to attack him before this junction  Ville¦roy  who commanded an army consisting of eight thousand men  near Tirlemont  had orders to en¦gage  He accordingly drew up his forces in a stron  100 camp  his right was flanked by the river Mehaigne  his left was posted behind a marsh  and the village of Ramillies lay in the center  Marlborough  who perceived this disposition  drew up his army accordingly  He knew that the enemies left could not pass the marsh  to attack him  but at a great disadvantage  he therefore weakened his troops on that quarter  and thundered on the center with superior numbers  They stood but a short time in the center  and  at length  gave way on all sides  The horse abandoned their foot  and were so closely pursued  that almost all were cut in pieces  Six thousand men were taken prisoners  and about eight thousand were killed or wounded  This victory was almost as signal as that of Blenheim  Bavaria and Cologne were the fruits of the one  and all Brabant was gained by the other  The French troops were dispirited  and the city of Paris overwhelmed with consternation  Lewis XIV  who  in the beginning of his reign  had long been flattered with conquest  was now humbled to such a degree as might have excited the compassion of his enemies  he intreated for peace  but in vain  the allies carried all before them  and his very capital dreaded the approach of the conquerors  What neither his power  his armies  nor his politics  could effect  a party in England performed  and the dissention between the Whigs and the Tories saved the dominions of France  that now seemed ready for ruin   I am   c   LETTER XII   QUEEN Anne s councils had hitherto been governed by a Whig ministry  they still pursued the schemes of the late King  and  upon republican principles  strove to diffuse freedom throughout   101 Europe  In a government  where the reasoning of individuals  retired from power  generally leads those who command  the designs of the ministry
