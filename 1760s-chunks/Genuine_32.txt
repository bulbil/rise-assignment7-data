trade  unless that of a bottle blower  which they esteem far beyond being a merchant     152She was much surprized at what had been told her concerning the gentleman with the red feather  though she could not then divine the mystery  yet she at length understood it  on being told  that such is the temper of the French  that they will rather starve than work  except they are employed in a glass house  which they esteem an honour  though they look on the profession of a merchant as an absolute disgrace   She next inquired of the duke  the name of a lady whom she saw dressed in a sumptuous suit of cloaths and very rich jewels  She was answered  that it was mademoiselle COIGNI  who  in spight of all that her relations could do  would not be confined to a nunnery  which is the method of getting rid of younger daughters in popish countries  that indeed  a very rich match had been offered her from one of the farmers general  worth three millions of livres  but that her father  who was of the best blood in France  had  with truly honourable indignation  refused to debase his family by such an alliance    153 and as his daughter would not retire to a convent  he had laid out all the money which he had destined for placing her there for life  which was her only portion  in cloaths and jewels  and that the chevalier de St  Louis  whom they had been just talking of  was pitched on for her intended husband   Our readers will  I dare say  be unable to help testifiying their surprise at such a noble beggar s wedding  and the more so when they are informed  that the lady s father  notwithstanding his great descent  had not interest enough to procure a subaltern commission in the army  or any  post equivalent   But to wave these remarks  and turn to the main point  Miss ELLIOT  having  as already shown  had the misfortune to disoblige her keeper  prepared herself for a journey with all convenient speed  and at the end of three days  having packed up all her things  she set out in a post chaise attended by three servants for Calais  the duke paying all the expences of her   154 journey  and presenting her with a bank note of five hundred pounds   Our female Traveller made so much haste to get out of France  that in forty eight hours she reached Abbeville  When she arrived there  she alighted out of the chaise to refresh herself  and as she was sitting in a room in the inn  she saw a young woman in a riding dress stop at the house where she was  and dismounting from her horse enter at the gate  Miss ELLIOT imagined she knew her face  and her curiosity was so great  that in order to satisfy it  she was prompted to take a nearer view of her  She accordingly quitted the room where she then was  and walked our to observe the stranger better  She was greatly surprised  when she found that it was her old acquaintance Miss Hammond  Our heroine made her go into her room  where being seated  she gave her the following account of her reasons for leaving England  and as they are too closely connected with her history to be seperated from it  I shall take the liberty to trespas s a little on my readers patience    155 while I relate them in the most concise manner possible   She was the only daughter of Mr  Hammond  a rich merchant in—Street  who gave her an education suitable to her birth  and the fortune he designed to give her  dancing musick  Italian and French  added to her figure  could not fail of procuring her an early train of lovers  Innocence  the happiest state of mortals  and her mother s care  protected her from all dishonourable attacks  Many matches were proposed for her  but either birth or fortune was deficient in the suitors   She happened once at an assembly to see a gentleman  who was as much a stranger to her as she was to him  He took her out to dance  and whispered to her frequently about the force of her charms  all which the innocent maid construed as the effect of his good breeding  The next day produced from him a letter full of knight errantry  with flames and darts at every line  Miss Hammond looked on this letter in its true light  thinking it    156 rather a testimony of his lust  than of hi• love   When he found her inexorable to all his fine speeches and letters  he left the place  though not without some stratagems to carry her off  A year elapsed  without her hearing any more of him  and he was entirely obliterated   At the end of this time  a man seemingly a gentleman  who pretended to be a Scotchman  fell in love with her  Her mother was then dead   and her father had now an opportunity of disposing of her  as he imagined  much to her advantage  Her intended husband proposed deferring the ceremony about a month  that there might be time to agree on the articles
