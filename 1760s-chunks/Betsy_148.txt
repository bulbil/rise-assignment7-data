that while we   use a man of sense and honour ill  we do ourselves a real injury  The   love our beauty has inspired  may  for a time  secure our power  but it   will grow weaker by degrees  and every little coquette air we give   ourselves  lessen the value of our charms  I know there is at present   some very great brul√©e between you and Mr  Trueworth  he is a match   every way deserving of you  he has the approbation of all your friends    and  I have heard you acknowledge  you are not insensible of his merit    To what end  then  do you study to perplex and give unnecessary pains to   a heart  which you  according to all appearances  will one day take a   pride in rendering happy         This is an extreme fine harangue  indeed   replied Miss Betsy   but I   would fain know for what reason it is directed to me  If Mr  Trueworth   imagines I have used him ill  I think it no proof of his understanding    to make a proclamation of it  but  for Heaven s sake  how came you to be   the confidante of his complaints         Indeed  I have not that honour   said Miss Mabel   finding myself a   little ill this morning  I thought the air would do me good  so went   into the Park  taking only a little girl with me  who lives next door    because I would not go quite alone  Being in the deshabille you see  I   crossed the grass  and was passing towards the back of the Bird Cage   Walk  where who should I see among the trees but Mr  Trueworth  if I may   call the object that then presented itself to me by that name  for    indeed  Miss Betsy  the poor gentleman seems no more than the shadow of   himself  He saw me at a distance  and I believe would have avoided me    but  perceiving my eyes were upon him  cleared his countenance as well   as he was able  and accosted me with the usual salutations of the   morning   It is somewhat surprizing  Madam   said he  with an air of as   much gallantry as he could assume   to find a lady so justly entitled to   the admiration of the world  as Miss Mabel is  shun the gay company of   the Mall  and chuse an unfrequented walk  like this     I might retort   the same exclamation of surprize   replied I   at so unexpectedly   meeting with Mr  Trueworth here         After this  as you know  my dear   continued she   I have lately  on   your account  had the pleasure pretty often of Mr  Trueworth s company    I took the liberty to ask him where he had buried himself  that I had   not seen him for so many days  to which he answered  not without a   confusion  which I saw he attempted  though in vain  to conceal from   me   Yes  Madam  I have indeed been buried from all pleasure  have been   swallowed up in affairs little less tormenting than those of the grave    but   added he   they are now over  and I am preparing to return to my   country seat  where I hope to re enjoy that tranquillity which  since my   leaving it  has been pretty much disturbed         Nothing could equal my astonishment at hearing him speak in this   manner   To your country seat   cried I   not to continue there for any   long time     I know not as yet  Madam   replied he  and then  after a   pause   perhaps for ever   added he   Bless me   said I   this is   strange  indeed  Miss Betsy did not tell me a word of it  and I saw her   but last night     She might not then know it  Madam   answered he     but  if she had  I am not vain enough to imagine  she would think a   trifle  such as my departure  worth the pains of mentioning         I then   pursued Miss Mabel   endeavoured to rally him out of this   humour  After having told him I had a better opinion of your   understanding and generosity  than to be capable of believing you   thought so lightly of his friendship and affection  I added  that this   was only some little pique between you  some jealous whim  but he   replied to all I said on
