into Rizzio s bosom  She was five months gone with child  and this horrid scene had such an effect upon the fruit of her womb  that it is said that her child  who was afterwards King James I  could never venture to look upon a drawn sword without shuddering  Thus ended Rizzio  a man who has been more spoken of  than perhaps any other who rose from so mean a station  What his other talents to please might have been  is unknown  but certain it is  that several indications of his skill in music remain even to the present time  all those pleasing Scotch airs  which are set in such a peculiar taste  being universally allowed to be of his composition   This was but a temporary check upon Mary s power  she resumed her authority  by the influence of her charms upon the Earl her husband  who   285 gave up the murderers of Rizzio to her resentment  but they had previously escaped into England  One criminal engagement  however  was scarcely got over  when Mary fell into a second  the Earl of Bothwell now began to hold the same place in her affections that Rizzio had formerly possessed  This new amour was attended with still more terrible consequences than the former  her husband fell a victim to it  His life was first attempted by poison  but the strength of his constitution saved him for a short time  only to fall by a more violent death  he was strangled by night  the house in which the fact was committed being blown up with gun powder  in order to persuade the people that his death was accidental  but his shirt not being singed  and his slippers found near him  together with blue marks round his neck  soon confirmed the suspicion of his real murder  His body was buried near that of Rizzio  among the Scottish Kings   All orders of the state  the whole body of people  accused Bothwell of this assassination  and at last demanded justice upon him from the Queen  for the late murder  openly arraigning him of the guilt  In this universal demand for justice  the Queen  deaf to the murmurs of her people  deaf to the voice of decency  married the murderer of her husband  and prevailed upon him to divorce his former wife to make way for this fatal alliance   Bothwell was possessed of all the insolence which attends great crimes  he assembled the principal Lords of the state  and compelled them to sign an instrument  purporting    that they judged it the Queen s interest to marry Bothwell  as he had lain with her against her will   These transactions excited the whole kingdom of Scotland to resistance  and   286 Mary  abandoned by her followers  was obliged to give herself up as a prisoner to the confederacy  Bothwell fled to the Orkney islands  The Queen  being confined in Lochlevin castle  was compelled to resign the crown to her son  as yet a child  but she was permitted to nominate a regent  She turned her eyes upon the Earl of Murray  who was then in France  and appointed him  expecting that he would defend her cause  and restore her  In this  however  she was entirely deceived  Murray  upon his arrival  instead of comforting her as he formerly used  loaded her with reproaches  which reduced her almost to despair  The calamities of the great  however justly deserved  excite pity and create friends  an army of forty thousand men declared in her favour  and she escaped from prison to put herself at their head  But this was only to encounter new misfortunes  she was met by a body of but four thousand  commanded by the new regent  and was totally defeated  For fear of falling into the hands of her enemies  she fled towards the borders of England  Elizabeth  being informed of her misfortunes and her retreat  at first granted her an honourable reception  and ordered her to be lodged at a gentleman s house  where she was treated with fitting dignity  Notwithstanding this kindness  she refused to see her until she had justified herself from the reproaches with which she was branded  By this means Elizabeth in a manner declared herself umpire of the differences between the two parties  and each accordingly pleaded their cause before her  Mary by her emissaries  and Murray  the regent  in person  It was the Queen of England s duty to protect  and not to examine  her royal fugitive  however  she lengthened out the pleadings on both   287 sides  and enjoyed the pleasure of seeing her rival humbled  without passing any definitive sentence  Mary privately complained of her unworthy treatment and long delay  these complaints were carried to Elizabeth  which ended in the Queen of Scots being sent a prisoner to Tutbury castle     The disasters of the crown of Scotland fell upon the people  divided as they were into factions  and animated with mutual animosity  The regent  attempting to quell them  was himself slain  and the assassins  pretending to act in the name of their imprisoned Queen  made an incursion into England  and committed some ravages on the frontier counties  Elizabeth  with an army  quickly repressed these invaders
