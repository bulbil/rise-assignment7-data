who  according to the instructions they had  received  no sooner saw it opened  than they rushed in  leaving their  employer in the street  where he thought his person would be least  endangered  Our adventurer  seeing him all alone  advanced with speed   and clapping a pistol to his breast  commanded him to follow his  footsteps without noise  on pain of immediate death   Terrified at this sudden apparition  Hornbeck obeyed in silence  and  in  a few minutes  they arrived at the quay  where Pickle  halting  gave  him to understand that he was no stranger to his villainous design  told  him  that if he conceived himself injured by any circumstance of his  conduct  he would now give him an opportunity of resenting the wrong in  a manner becoming a man of honour   You have a sword about you   said  he   or  if you don t choose to put the affair on that issue  here is a  brace of pistols  take which you please   Such an address could not fail  to disconcert a man of his character  After some hesitation  he  in a  faltering accent  denied that his design was to mutilate Mr  Pickle  but  that he thought himself entitled to the benefit of the law  by which he  would have obtained a divorce  if he could have procured evidence of his  wife s infidelity  and  with that view  he had employed people to  take advantage of the information he had received  With regard to this  alternative  he declined it entirely  because he could not see what  satisfaction he should enjoy in being shot through the head  or run  through the lungs  by a person who had already wronged him in an  irreparable manner  Lastly  his fear made him propose that the affair  should be left to the arbitration of two creditable men  altogether  unconcerned in the dispute   To these remonstrances Peregrine replied  in the style of a hot headed  young man  conscious of his own unjustifiable behaviour  that every  gentleman ought to be a judge of his own honour and therefore he would  submit to the decision of no umpire whatsoever  that he would forgive  his want of courage  which might be a natural infirmity  but his mean  dissimulation he could not pardon  That  as he was certified of the  rascally intent of his ambuscade by undoubted intelligence  he would  treat him  not with a retaliation of his own treachery  but with such  indignity as a scoundrel deserves to suffer  unless he would make one  effort to maintain the character he assumed in life  So saying  he again  presented his pistols  which being rejected as before  he called his two  ministers  and ordered them to duck him in the canal   This command was pronounced and executed almost in the same breath  to  the unspeakable terror and disorder of the poor shivering patient  who   having undergone the immersion  ran about like a drowned rat  squeaking  for assistance and revenge  His cries were overheard by the patrol   who  chancing to pass that way  took him under their protection  and   in consequence of his complaint and information  went in pursuit of our  adventurer and his attendants  who were soon overtaken and surrounded   Rash and inconsiderate as the young gentleman was  he did not pretend  to stand upon the defensive against a file of musketeers  although Pipes  had drawn his cutlass at their approach  but surrendered himself without  opposition  and was conveyed to the main guard  where the commanding  officer  engaged by his appearance and address  treated him with all    6 22 15  3 45 PM   imaginable respect  Hearing the particulars of his adventure  he assured  him that the prince would consider the whole as a tour de jeunesse  and  order him to be released without delay   Next morning  when this gentleman gave in his report  he made such a  favourable representation of the prisoner  that our hero was on the  point of being discharged  when Hornbeck preferred a complaint  accusing  him of a purposed assassination  and praying that such punishment should  be inflicted upon him as his highness should think adequate to the  nature of the crime  The prince  perplexed with this petition  in  consequence of which he foresaw that he must disoblige a British  subject  sent for the plaintiff  of whom he had some knowledge  and  in  person  exhorted him to drop the prosecution  which would only serve to  propagate his own shame  But Hornbeck was too much incensed to listen to  any proposal of that kind  and peremptorily demanded justice against  the prisoner  whom he represented as an obscure adventurer  who had made  repeated attempts upon his honour and his life  Prince Charles told him   that what he had advised was in the capacity of a friend  but  since he  insisted upon his acting as a magistrate  the affair should be examined   and determined according to the dictates of justice
