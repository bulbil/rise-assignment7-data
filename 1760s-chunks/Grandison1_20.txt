me  madam  but I believe you would not disdain to answer my question yourself —Are you  madam  are you absolutely and bona fide  disengaged  or are you not   As this  Sir Rowland  answer d I  is a question I can best resolve  I frankly own  that I am disengaged   Charming  charming —Mercy  Why now what a noble frankness in that answer —No jesting matter  You may smile  Ladies —I hope  madam  you say true  I hope I may rely upon it  that your affections are not engaged   You may  Sir Rowland  I do not love  even in jest  to be guilty of an untruth   Admirable —But let me tell you  madam  that I hope you will not many days have this to say  Ad s my life  sweet soul  how I rejoice to see that charming flush in the finest cheek in the world  But heaven forbid that I should dash so sweet a creature —Well  but now there is no going further  Excuse me  Ladies  I mean not a slight to any of you  But now  you know  there is no going further —And will you  madam  permit me to introduce to you  as a Lover  as an humble Servant  a very proper and   45 agreeable young man  Let me introduce him  He is my nephew  Your looks are all graciousness  Perhaps you have seen him  And if you are really disengaged  you can have no objection to him  of that I am confident  And I am told  that you have nobody that either can or will controul you   The more controulable for that very reason  Sir Rowland   Ad s my life  I like your answer  Why  madam  you must be full as good as you look to be  I wish I were a young man myself for your sake  But tell me  madam  will you permit a visit from my nephew this afternoon —Come  come  dear young lady  be as gracious as you look to be  Fortune must do  Had you not a shilling  I should rejoice in such a niece  And that is more than I ever said in my life before  My nephew is a sober man  a modest man  He has a good estate of his own  A clear 2000 l  a year  I will add to it in my life time as much more  Be all this good company witnesses for me  I am no flincher  It is well known that the word of Sir Rowland Meredith is as good as his bond at all times  I love these open doings  I love to be above board  What signifies shilly shally  What says the old proverb   Happy s the wooing  That is not long a doing   But  Sir Rowland  said I  there are proverbs that may be set against your proverb  You hint that I have seen the gentleman  Now I have never yet seen the man whose addresses I could encourage   O  I like you the better for that  None but the giddy love at first sight  Ad s my life  you would have been snapt up before now  young as you are  could you easily have returned love for love  Why  madam  you cannot be above sixteen   O  Sir Rowland  you are mistaken  Chearfulness  and a contented mind  make a difference to advantage   46 of half a dozen years at any time  I am much nearer twenty one than nineteen  I assure you   Nearer to twenty one than nineteen  and yet so freely tell your age without asking   Miss Byron  Sir Rowland  said Mrs  Reeves  is young enough at twenty  surely  to own her age   True  madam  but at twenty  if not before  time always stands still with women  A Lady s age once known  will be always remembred  and that more for Spite than Love  At twenty eight or thirty  I believe most Ladies are willing to strike off half a dozen years at least—And yet  and yet  smiling  and looking arch  I have always said  pardon me  Ladies  that it is a sign  when women are so desirous to conceal their age  that they think they shall be good for nothing when in years  Ah  Ladies  shaking his head  and laughing  women don t think of that  But how I admire you  madam  for your frankness  Would to the Lord you were twenty four —I would have no woman marry under twenty four  And that  let me tell you  Ladies  for the following reasons—standing up  and putting the fore finger of his right hand  extended with a flourish  upon the thumb of his left   O  Sir Rowland  I doubt not but you can give very good reasons  And I assure you  I intend not to marry on the wrong side  as I call it  of twenty four   Admirable  by Mercy  but that won t do neither  The man lives not  young Lady  who will stay
