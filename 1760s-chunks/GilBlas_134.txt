spark  My lord  my master Don Felix begs you ten thousand pardons  but he cannot have the pleasure of waiting on you here this evening  He is with three men of Toledo  from whom he cannot possibly get away  Oh  the wicked little rogue  exclaimed Donna Kimena  as sure as a gun then he is going to make a night of it  No  madam  replied I  they are deeply engaged in very serious business  He is really distressed that he cannot pay his respects  and commissioned me to say everything proper to your ladyship and Donna Aurora  Oh  I will have none of his excuses  pouted out my mistress  he knows very well that I have been indisposed  and might shew some slight degree of feeling for so near a relation  As a punishment  he shall not come near me for this fortnight  Nay  madam  interposed Don Lewis  such a sentence is too severe  Don Felix s fate is but too pitiable  in having been deprived of your society this evening   They bandied about their fine speeches on these little topics of gallantry for some time  and then Pacheco withdrew  The lovely Aurora metamorphosed herself in a twinkling  and resumed her swashing outside  The grass did not grow under her feet while she was running to the other lodging  I have a million of apologies to make  my dear friend  said she to Don Lewis  for not giving you the meeting at my aunt s  but there was no getting rid of the tiresome people I was with  However  there is one comfort  you have had so much the more leisure to look about you  and criticise my cousin s beauty  Well  and how do you like her  She is a most lovely creature  answered Pacheco  You were in the right to claim a resemblance to her  I never saw more correspondent features  the very same cast of countenance  the eyes exactly alike  the mouth evidently a family feature  and the tone of voice scarcely to be distinguished  The likeness  however  goes no further  for Aurora is taller than you  she is brown and you are fair  you are a jolly fellow  she has a little touch of the demure  so that you are not altogether the male and female Sosias  As for good sense  continued he  if an angel from heaven were to whisper wisdom in one ear  and your cousin her mortal chit chat in the other  I am afraid the angel might whistle for an audience  In a word  Aurora is all accomplished   Signor Pacheco uttered these last words with so earnest an expression  that Don Felix said with a smile    My friend  I advise you to stay away from Donna Kimena s  it will be more for your peace of mind  Aurora de Guzman may set your wits a wandering  and inspire a passion          I have no need of seeing her again  interrupted he  to become distractedly enamoured of her  I am sorry for you  replied the pretended Mendoza  for you are not a man to be seriously caught  and my cousin is not to be made a fool of  take my word for it  She would never encourage a lover whose designs were otherwise than honourable  Otherwise than honourable  retorted Don Lewis  who could have the audacity to form such on a lady of her rank and character  As for me  I should esteem myself the happiest of mankind  could she be prevailed on to favour my addresses  and link her fate with mine   Since those are your sentiments  rejoined Don Felix  you may command my services  Yes  I will go heart and hand with you in the business  All my interest in Aurora shall be yours  and by to morrow morning I will commence an attack on my aunt  whose good word has more influence than you may think  Pacheco returned his thanks with the best air possible to this young go between  and we were all agog at the promising appearance of our stratagem  On the following day we found the means of heightening the dramatic effect by entangling the plot a little more  My mistress  after having waited on Donna Kimena  as if to speak a good word in favour of the suitor  came back with the result of the interview  I have spoken to my aunt  said she  but it was as much as I could do to make her hear your proposal with patience  She was primed and loaded against you  Some good natured friend in the dark has painted you out for a reprobate  but I took your part with some little quickness  and at length succeeded in vindicating your moral character from the attack it had sustained   This is not all  continued Aurora  You had better enter on the subject with my aunt in my presence  we shall be able to make something of her between us  Pacheco was all impatience to insinuate himself into the good graces of Donna Kimena  nor was the opportunity deferred beyond the next morning  Our amphibious Mendoza escorted him into the presence of Dame Ortiz  where such a conversation passed between the trio as put fire and tow
