no secret thro  all Europe  and whichever of these accidents   had happened  must be very grievous to a gentleman of Dorilaus s   disposition  who  when unknowing he was his son  loved him with more   tenderness than many fathers do their offspring  but now convinced not   only that he was so  but also that he was possessed of such amiable   qualities as might do honour to the most illustrious race  had fixed an   idea in his mind of such a lasting happiness in having him near him    that the thoughts of being deprived of him for ever threw him into a   melancholy  which not all the friends he had acquired in Paris  not all   the gaieties of that place  nor the sweet society of the engaging and   dutiful Louisa  had the power to console  So deep was his affliction    that monsieur du Plessis  amorous and impatient as he was  had not   courage to urge a grant of his own happiness  while those who were to   bestow it  were incapable of sharing any part of it       Soon after there arrived a thunder clap indeed   certain intelligence   that the once victorious Charles was totally overthrown  his whole army   either cut to pieces or taken prisoners  and himself a fugitive in the   grand seignior s dominions   Dorilaus  now not doubting but the worst he   feared had come to pass  shut himself from all company  and refused the   unavailing comfort of those who came to offer it   The fair eyes of   Louisa were continually drowned in tears  and the generous du Plessis   sympathized in all her griefs  But what became of mademoiselle Charlotta   de Palfoy  her tender soul  so long accustomed to love Horatio  had not   courage to support the shock of losing him   losing him at a time when   she thought herself secure of being united to him for ever   when his   discovered birth had rendered her father s wishes conformable to her   own  and there wanted nothing but his presence to render both their   families completely blessed   all that excess of love which modesty had   hitherto restrained her from giving any public marks of  now shewed   itself in the violence of her grief and her despair   She made no secret   of her softest inclinations  and gave a loose to all the impatience of a   ruined love  Even the haughty baron was melted into tears of compassion    and so far from condemning  that  he attempted all in his power to   alleviate her sorrows             CHAP  XXVI        The Catastrophe of the whole        Poor Horatio  released  as I have already said  from his worse than   Turkish bondage  had now  with the companions of his misfortunes  left a   country where they had suffered so much and had so little to hope  that   their enlargement seemed even to themselves a miracle   As they parted    miserable and forlorn  thro  those provinces where  about a year before    they had marched with so much pomp and force  as  together with the king   of Sweden s name  inspired admiration and terror over all those parts of   the world  it filled them with the most poignant anguish  and drew tears   from those among them least sensible of any tender emotions       All this disconsolate company  except Horatio  being Swedes   they made   the best of their way  some to Stockholm  and others to Straelsund   Now   left alone  a long journey before him  and altogether uncertain what   reception he should find at Paris  either from Dorilaus or mademoiselle   Charlotta  his condition was extremely pityable  and he stood in need of   more fortitude than could be expected from his years  to enable him to   go thro  it       The nearer he approached Paris  the greater was his shock at the   necessity of appearing there in the despicable figure he now made  but   his courage still got the better  and surmounted all difficulties  If   Dorilaus thinks my disobedience to his commands a crime too great to   merit his forgiveness  would he say to himself  or Charlotta disdains    in his misfortunes  the faithful Horatio  I have no more to do than to   return to Poland and seek an honourable death in the service of   Stanislaus       He made his entrance into that opulent city through the most bye ways he   could  and concealed himself till towards night in a little cabaret    where having soon been informed where Dorilaus lived  he went when it   was quite dark to his house  though how divided between hope and fear it   is easy
