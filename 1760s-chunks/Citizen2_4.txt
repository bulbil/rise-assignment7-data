to which the wife  as is usual in such cases  bid God bless him  Ay  but  returns the husband  woman  do you say that from your heart  Indeed    7 I do  my poor Nicholas  cries his wife  I say it with all my heart  If so then  says the husband  we had as good remove the fiddle case   LETTER LXIV  From the same   BOOKS  my son  while they teach us to respect the interests of others  often make us unmindful of our own  while they instruct the youthful reader to grasp at social happiness  he grows miserable in detail  and attentive to universal harmony  often forgets that he himself has a part to sustain in the concert  I dislike therefore the philosopher who describes the inconveniencies of life in such pleasing colours that the pupil grows enamoured of distress  longs to try the charms of poverty  meets it without dread  nor fears its inconveniencies till he severely feels them   A youth  who has thus spent his life among books  new to the world  and unacquainted with man  but by philosophic information  may be considered as a being  whose mind is filled with the vulgar errors of the wise  utterly unqualified for a journey through life  yet confident of his own skill in the direction  he sets out with confidence  blunders on with vanity  and finds himself at last undone   He first has learned from books  and then lays it down as a maxim  that all mankind are virtuous or vicious in excess  and he has been long   8 taught to detest vice and love virtue  warm therefore in attachments  and stedfast in enmity  he treats every creature as a friend or foe  expects from those he loves unerring integrity  and consigns his enemies to the reproach of wanting every virtue  On this principle he proceeds  and here begin his disappointments  upon a closer inspection of human nature  he perceives  that he should have moderated his friendship  and softened his severity  for he often finds the excellencies of one part of mankind clouded with vice  and the faults of the other brightened with virtue  he finds no character so sanctified that has not its failings  none so infamous  but has somewhat to attract our esteem  he beholds impiety in lawn  and fidelity in fetters   He now therefore  but too late  perceives that his regards should have been more cool  and his hatred less violent  that the truly wise seldom court romantic friendships with the good  and avoid  if possible  the resentment even of the wicked  every moment gives him fresh instances that the bonds of friendship are broken if drawn too closely  and that those whom he has treated with disrespect more than retaliate the injury  at length therefore he is obliged to confess  that he has declared war upon the vicious half of mankind  without being able to form an alliance among the virtuous to espouse his quarrel   Our book taught philosopher  however  is now too far advanced to recede  and though poverty be the just consequence of the many enemies his conduct has created  yet he is resolved to meet it without shrinking  philosophers have described   9 poverty in most charming colours  and even his vanity is touched  in thinking  that he shall shew the world  in himself  one more example of patience  fortitude  and resignation  Come then  O Poverty  for what is there in thee dreadful to the WISE  temperance  health  and frugality  walk in thy train  cheerfulness and liberty are ever thy companions  Shall any be ashamed of thee of whom Cincinatus was not ashamed  the running brook  the herbs of the field can amply satisfy nature  man wants but little  nor that little long  come then  O Poverty  while kings stand by and gaze with admiration  at the true philosopher s resignation   The goddess appears  for Poverty ever comes at the call  but alas  he finds her by no means the charming figure books and his warm imagination had painted  As when an eastern bride whom her friends and relations had long described as a model of perfection  pays her first visit  the longing bridegroom lifts the veil to see a face he had never seen before  but instead of a countenance  blazing with beauty like the sun  he beholds deformity shooting icicles to his heart  such appears Poverty to her new entertainer  all the fabric of enthusiasm is at once demolished  and a thousand miseries rise upon its ruins  while Contempt  with pointing finger  is foremost in the hideous procession   The poor man now finds that he can get no kings to look at him while he is eating  he finds that in proportion as he grows poor  the world turns its back upon him  and gives him leave to act the philosopher in all the majesty of solitude  it might be agreeable enough to play the philosopher    10 while we are conscious that mankind are spectators  but what signifies wearing the mask of sturdy contentment  and mounting the stage of restraint  when not one creature will assist at the exhibition  Thus is he forsaken of men  while his fortitude
