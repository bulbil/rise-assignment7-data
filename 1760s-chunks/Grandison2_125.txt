woman for a wife who gave me reason to imagine  that she was likely to balance a moment  as to her choice of me  or any other man   Something in that  said the Colonel   As you explain yourself  Sir Charles  said the Major—  The Captain  however  sat swelling  He was not so easily satisfied   Your motive  we are not to question  Captain  was Love  Miss Grandison is a young woman whom any man may love  By the way  where a man is assured of a return in Love  there is no occasion for a promise  But a promise was made  My sister is a woman of honour  She thinks herself bound by it  and she is content to lead a single life to the end of it  if you will not acquit her of this promise  Yet she leaves  and at the time did leave  you free  You will have the justice  Sir  to allow  that there is generosity in her conduct to you  which remains for you to shew to her  since a promise should not be made but on equal terms  Would you hold her to it  and be not held yourself  She desires not to hold you  Let me tell you  Captain  that if I had been in your situation  and had been able to prevail upon myself to endeavour to bring a Lady to make me such a promise  I should have doubted her love of me  had she not sought to bind me to her by an equal tie  What  should I have said to myself  Is this Lady dearer to me than all the women upon earth  Do I seek to bind her to me by a solemn promise  which shall give me a power over her  And has she so little regard for me  as not to value  whether I marry any other woman   The Gentlemen looked upon one another  but were silent  I proceeded   Le us set this matter in its true light  Here is a   313 young woman  who had suffered herself to be embarrassed in a treaty  that her whole heart  she assures me  was never in  This was her fault  But know we not how inextricable are the entanglements of Love  as it is called  when young women are brought to enter into correspondence with men  Our Sex have opportunities of knowing the world  which the other have not  Experience  gentlemen  engaging with inexperience  and perhaps to the difference of twice the number of years  Sir  said the Captain   the combat must be too unequal  How artfully do men endeavour to draw in the women whom they think it worth their while to pursue —But would any man here wish to marry a woman  who declares that she was insensibly drawn in beyond her purpose  Who shewed  when she refused to promise that she would be his  in preference to all other men  that she did not love him above all other men  Who  when she was prevailed on to fetter herself  made him not of consequence enough to herself to bind him  And  in a word  who has long ago declared to him  and steadily persists in the declaration  That she never will be his —You seem  gentlemen  to be men of spirit  Would you wish to marry the first woman on earth on these terms  if you could obtain her —which  however  is not the case  since Miss Grandison s promise extends not so far as to oblige her to marry Captain Anderson   The Captain did not  he told me  like some part of what I had said  and still less some of the words I had used —And seemed to be disposing his features to take a livelier turn than became the occasion  I interrupted him therefore  I meet you not  Captain  said I  either to hear  or to obviate  cavils upon words  When I have told you  that I came with an amicable intention  I expect to be believed  I intend not offence  But let us be men  I am perhaps a younger man by ten years  than any one present  but I have seen the   314 world  as much as any man of my age  and know what is due to the character of a Gentleman  whether it be captain Anderson s  or my own  And expect not wilful misconstructions   All I mean is  Sir  said the Captain  that I will not be treated contemptuously  no  not even by the brother of Miss Grandison   The brother of Miss Grandison  Sir  is not accustomed to treat any man contemptuously  Don t treat yourself so  and you are safe from unworthy treatment from me  Let me add  Sir  that I permit every man to six his character with me  as he pleases  I will venture to say  I have a large charity  but I extend it not to tameness  But yet will always allow a third person to decide upon the justice of my intentions and actions   The Captain said  That he ascribed a great deal of my sister s positiveness in her denial of
