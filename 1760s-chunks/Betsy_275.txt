first aggressor  the other seldom    if ever  behaves so as not to incur some part of the blame         Your ladyship is all goodness   said Mr  Munden  very respectfully     and  in what you have said  discover not only a penetration  but also a   love of justice  which can never be too much admired and applauded  What   your ladyship has observed between me and Mrs  Munden  is exactly the   thing  it is certain  that both of us have been to blame  I have    perhaps  acted in a manner somewhat too abruptly towards her  and she in   one too resentful  and too imperious  towards me  and though I am   willing to allow my dear Betsy all the merit of those good qualities she   is possessed of  yet I cannot help giving her some part of the character   Mr  Congreve ascribes to Zara in his Mourning Bride  and saying             That she has passion  which outstrips the winds        And roots her reason up        Lady Trusty  who  for the sake of Mrs  Munden s reputation  was so   eager to patch up a reconciliation at any rate between her and her   husband  would not seem to defend her behaviour as a wife  while she   gently accused him of having too far exerted the authority of a husband       In a word  both Sir Ralph and his lady managed in so artful a manner    still blending cajolings with remonstrances  that  when they came to   enter into a discussion on this affair  Mr  Munden  whatever he thought   in his heart  could not forbear seeming to yield to the justice of their   reasonings       He consented  though not without some scruples  and a much greater share   of inward reluctance than his complaisance would permit him to make shew   of  to add one guinea per week to his allowance for the expences of his   table  As to the rest  he readily enough agreed to meet his wife half   way towards a reconciliation  assured them  that he was far from   requiring any other submission on her part  than what he would set her   the example of in himself  and that he wished nothing more than to   exchange forgiveness with her       On this  Lady Trusty dispatched a servant directly to Mrs  Munden  to   let her know she must needs speak with her immediately  which summons   was no sooner delivered than complied with       This prudent lady having cast about in her mind all that was proper to   be done  in order to accomplish the good work she laboured for  and had   so much at heart  would not leave it in the power of chance to   disappoint what she had so happily begun  and having prevailed over the   ill nature and sourness of the husband  thought it equally necessary to   prevent the resentment  or inadvertency  of the wife from frustrating   her endeavours       On being told that Mrs  Munden was come  she ran down stairs to receive   her  led her into a parlour  and informed her  as briefly as she could    all that part which she thought would be most satisfactory to her  of   the conversation which had passed between them and Mr  Munden on her   score       Finding what she said was received by the other more coolly than she   wished  she took that privilege which her rank  her age  and the   friendship she had always shewn to her  might justly claim  to   remonstrate to her  that it did not become her situation and character   to stand too much upon punctilios at this time  when all that either   was  or ought to be  dear to womankind  depended on a speedy   accommodation with her husband   The unhappy brul√©e   said she   has   lasted too long  your servants must certainly know it  you cannot be   assured of their secrecy  the whole affair  perhaps  with large   additions to it  will soon become the talk of the town  every one will   be descanting upon it  and how much soever Mr  Munden may be in fault    you cannot hope to escape your share in the censure        Poor Mrs  Munden  who looked upon this lady as a second mother  would   not attempt to offer any thing in opposition to the arguments she used    and  besides  could not forbear avowing  within herself  the justice of   them   Well  Madam   answered she  with a deep sigh   I shall
