 during the ball  the most dreadful storm I ever heard  it seemed to shake the whole habitable globe       Heaven preserve my Emily from its fury  I have a thousand fears on her account   Twelve o clock       Your brother is arrived  he has been here about an hour  he flew to Silleri  without going at all to Quebec  he enquired for Emily  he would not believe she was gone       There is no expressing how much he was shocked when convinced she had taken this voyage without him  he would have followed her in an open boat  in hopes of overtaking her at Coudre  if my father had not detained him almost by force  and at last convinced him of the impossibility of overtaking her  as the winds  having been constantly fair  must before this have carried them out of the river       He has sent his servant to Quebec  with orders to take passage for him in the first ship that sails  his impatience is not to be described       He came down in the hope of marrying her here  and conducting her himself to England  he forms to himself a thousand dangers to her  which he fondly fancies his presence could have averted  in short  he has all the unreasonableness of a man in love       I propose sending this  and a large packet more  by your brother  unless some unexpected opportunity offers before       Adieu  my dear   Yours    A  FERMOR     LETTER CLI   151   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   6th   YOUR brother has taken his passage in a very fine ship  which will sail the 10th  you may expect him every hour after you receive this  which I send  with what I wrote yesterday  by a small vessel which sails a week sooner then was intended       Rivers persuades Fitzgerald to apply for the lands which he had fixed upon on Lake Champlain  as he has no thoughts of ever returning hither       I will prevent this  however  if I have any influence  I cannot think with patience of continuing in America  when my two amiable friends have left it  I had no motive for wishing a settlement here  but to form a little society of friends  of which they made the principal part       Besides  the spirit of emulation would have kept up my courage  and given fire and brilliancy to my fancy       Emily and I should have been trying who had the most lively genius at creation  who could have produced the fairest flowers  who have formed the woods and rocks into the most beautiful arbors  vistoes  grottoes  have taught the streams to flow in the most pleasing meanders  have brought into view the greatest number and variety of those lovely little falls of water with which this fairy land abounds  and shewed nature in the fairest form       In short  we should have been continually endeavoring  following the luxuriancy of female imagination  to render more charming the sweet abodes of love and friendship  whilst our heroes  changing their swords into plough shares  and engaged in more substantial  more profitable labors  were clearing land  raising cattle and corn  and doing every thing becoming good farmers  or  to express it more poetically     Taming the genius of the stubborn plain   Almost as quickly as they conquer d Spain           By which I would be understood to mean the Havannah  where  vanity apart  I am told both of them did their duty  and a little more  if a man can in such a case be said to do more       In one word  they would have been studying the useful  to support us  we the agreable  to please and amuse them  which I take to be assigning to the two sexes the employments for which nature intended them  notwithstanding the vile example of the savages to the contrary       There are now no farmeresses in Canada worth my contending with  therefore the whole pleasure of the thing would be at an end  even on the supposition that friendship had not been the soul of our design       Say every thing for me to Temple and Mrs  Rivers  and to my dearest Emily  if arrived       Adieu  your faithful  A  FERMOR     LETTER CLII   152   To the Earl of —   Silleri  June 6  1767   IT is very true  my Lord  that the jesuit missionaries still continue in the Indian villages in Canada  and I am afraid it is no less true  that they use every art to instill into those people an aversion to the English  at least I have been told this by the Indians themselves  who seem equally surprized and piqued that we do not send missionaries amongst them        Their ideas of christianity are extremely circumscribed  and they give no preference to one mode of our faith above another  they regard a missionary of any nation as a kind father  who comes to instruct them in the best way of worshiping the Deity
