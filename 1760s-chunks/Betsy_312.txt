he omitted nothing that might convince her   of a sincere welcome       On discoursing together concerning her obtaining a separate maintenance    it was the opinion of both of them  that Mr  Markland the lawyer should   be advised with  as he was a man who could not but be well experienced   in such affairs  and accordingly a servant was dispatched to that   gentleman  to desire he would come to them the next day       But though she had reason to be highly satisfied with the reception   given her by her brother  yet she could not be quite easy till she   should hear what judgment her dear Lady Loveit would pass on the step   she had taken  She went the next morning to pay a visit at that lady s   toilette  she related to her sincerely every particular of the   provocation she had received  the manner in which she had resented it    and the resolution she had taken of living in an eternal state of   separation from so bad a man  to which Lady Loveit replied  that though   she was extremely sorry for the occasion  yet she thought if she had   acted otherwise  it would have been an injustice not only to herself    but to all wives in general  by setting them an example of submitting to   things required of them neither by law nor nature       This encouragement  from a lady of her known scrupulous disposition    made Mrs  Munden not doubt but she would be equally absolved by Lady   Trusty and her brother Frank  to both whom she wrote an account of all   she had done       On her return from Lady Loveit s  she found a letter from Mr  Munden  in   answer to that she had sent to him the day before  the contents whereof   were as follow             To Mrs  Munden            Madam            The unaccountableness of your behaviour astonishes me  For heaven s        sake  how can you answer to yourself the having quitted your        husband s house for so trifling a pretence  It is true  I did not        at first give much regard to your complaint against Mademoiselle de        Roquelair  but  on considering it  I obliged her to depart        immediately  I do assure you she set out yesterday for Dover  and I        believe by this time is as far as Calais on her way to Bologne  so        that there now remains no excuse for your absenting yourself  and        if you should continue to do so  it will be a very plain proof that        you are extremely wanting in that duty and affection which the        laws both of God and man expect from you  But I flatter myself that        is not the case  and therefore expect you will return with all        possible expedition to him who will be always ready to prove        himself your most affectionate husband            G  MUNDEN            P S  I know not what you mean by terms of separation  a wife who        elopes from her husband forfeits all claim to every thing that is        his  and can expect nothing from him till she returns to her        obedience  but were it otherwise  and the law entirely on your side        in this point  you might be certain that I look upon the happiness        of possessing you in too just a light to be easily brought into any        agreement that would deprive me of you        Though Mr  Munden wanted not cunning in most things  yet in writing this   epistle he seemed not to consider the spirit or the penetration of his   wife  who  he might have known  had too great a share of both to be   either intimidated by the majesterial air of some of the expressions  or   soothed by the fawning  unsincere compliments  of the others       This vain attempt therefore only served to remind her of the many proofs   she had received both of his ill nature and deceit towards her  and    instead of weakening the resolution she had taken of not living with him   again  rather rendered it more strong and permanent
