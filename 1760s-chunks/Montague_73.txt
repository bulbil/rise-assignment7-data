attribute the superior increase of the British American settlements compared to those of France  a religion which encourages idleness  and makes a virtue of celibacy  is particularly unfavorable to colonization       However religious prejudice may have been suffered to counterwork policy under a French government  it is scarce to be doubted that this cause of the poverty of Canada will by degrees be removed  that these people  slaves at present to ignorance and superstition  will in time be enlightened by a more liberal education  and gently led by reason to a religion which is not only preferable  as being that of the country to which they are now annexed  but which is so much more calculated to make them happy and prosperous as a people       Till that time  till their prejudices subside  it is equally just  humane  and wise  to leave them the free right of worshiping the Deity in the manner which they have been early taught to believe the best  and to which they are consequently attached       It would be unjust to deprive them of any of the rights of citizens on account of religion  in America  where every other sect of dissenters are equally capable of employ with those of the established church  nay where  from whatever cause  the church of England is on a footing in many colonies little better than a toleration       It is undoubtedly  in a political light  an object of consequence every where  that the national religion  whatever it is  should be as universal as possible  agreement in religious worship being the strongest tie to unity and obedience  had all prudent means been used to lessen the number of dissenters in our colonies  I cannot avoid believing  from what I observe and hear  that we should have found in them a spirit of rational loyalty  and true freedom  instead of that factious one from which so much is to be apprehended       It seems consonant to reason  that the religion of every country should have a relation to  and coherence with  the civil constitution  the Romish religion is best adapted to a despotic government  the presbyterian to a republican  and that of the church of England to a limited monarchy like ours       As therefore the civil government of America is on the same plan with that of the mother country  it were to be wished the religious establishment was also the same  especially in those colonies where the people are generally of the national church  though with the fullest liberty of conscience to dissenters of all denominations       I would be clearly understood  my Lord  from all I have observed here  I am convinced  nothing would so much contribute to diffuse a spirit of order  and rational obedience  in the colonies  as the appointment  under proper restrictions  of bishops  I am equally convinced that nothing would so much strengthen the hands of government  or give such pleasure to the well affected in the colonies  who are by much the most numerous  as such an appointment  however clamored against by a few abettors of sedition       I am called upon for this letter  and must remit to another time what I wished to say more to your Lordship in regard to this country       I have the honor to be   My Lord   c   WM  FERMOR     LETTER CXVIII   118   To Mrs  MELMOTH  at Montreal   Silleri  April 8   I AM indeed  Madam  this inconsistent creature  I have at once refused to marry Colonel Rivers  and owned to him all the tenderness of my soul       Do not however think me mad  or suppose my refusal the effect of an unmeaning childish affectation of disinterestedness  I can form to myself no idea of happiness equal to that of spending my life with Rivers  the best  the most tender  the most amiable of mankind  nor can I support the idea of his marrying any other woman  I would therefore marry him to morrow were it possible without ruining him  without dooming him to a perpetual exile  and obstructing those views of honest ambition at home  which become his birth  his connexions  his talents  his time of life  and with which  as his friend  it is my duty to inspire him       His affection for me at present blinds him  he sees no object but me in the whole universe  but shall I take advantage of that inebriation of tenderness  to seduce him into a measure inconsistent with his real happiness and interest  He must return to England  must pursue fortune in that world for which he was formed  shall his Emily retard him in the glorious race  shall she not rather encourage him in every laudable attempt  shall she suffer him to hide that shining merit in the uncultivated wilds of Canada  the seat of barbarism and ignorance  which entitles him to hope a happy fate in the dear land of arts and arms       I entreat you to do all you can to discourage his design  Remind him that his sister s marriage has in some degree removed the cause of his coming hither  that he can have now no motive for fixing here  but his tenderness
