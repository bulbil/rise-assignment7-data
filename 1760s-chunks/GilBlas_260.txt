 and a knight of Calatrava wanted the government  for which he was willing to pay me one thousand pistoles  The minister was ready to burst with laughing  to see me so eager after the scut  By all the powers  my friend Gil Blas  said he  you go to work tooth and nail  You have a most inveterate itch to do as you would be done by  But mark me  When mere trifles stand between us  I shall not stand upon trifles  but when governments or other places of real value are in question  you will have the modesty to be content with half the fee for yourself and will account to me for the other half  It is inconceivable at what expense I stand  and how it presses on my finances to support the dignity of my station  for though disinterestedness looks vastly well in the eyes of the world  you are to understand between ourselves that I have made a solemn vow against dipping into my private fortune  On this hint  arrange your future plans   My master  by this discourse  relieving me from the fear of being troublesome  or rather egging me on to run at the ring for every prize  made me still more worldly minded than ever I had been before  I should not have objected to circulating hand bills  with an invitation to all candidates for places to apply on certain terms at the secretary s office  My functions were here  Scipio s were there  and we met at the receipt of custom  My client got the government of Vera for his thousand pistoles  and as our price was fixed  a knight of St James met his brother of Calatrava in the market on an equal footing  But mere governors were paltry fish to fry  I distributed orders of knighthood  and converted some good stupid burgesses into most insufferable gentry by one stroke of the pen  and a lacing across the shoulders with a broad sword  The clergy  too  were not forgotten in my charities  Lesser preferments were in my gift  everything up to prebendal stalls and collegiate dignities  With regard to bishoprics and archbishoprics  Don Rodrigo de Calderona had the charge of our holy religion  As church and state must always go together  supreme magistracies  commanderies  and viceroyalties were all in his gift  whence the reader will naturally infer  that the upper offices were little better tenanted than the lower ones  since the subjects on whom our election fell  establishing their pretensions on a certain palpable criterion  were not necessarily and unavoidably either the cleverest or the best  principled people in the world  We knew very well that the wits and lampooners of Madrid made themselves merry at our expense  but we borrowed our philosophy from misers  who hug themselves under the hootings of the people  when they count over the accumulation of their pelf   Isocrates was in the right to insinuate  in his elegant Greek expression  that what is got over the devil s back is spent under his belly  When I saw myself master of thirty thousand ducats  and in a fair way to gain perhaps ten times as much  it seemed to be a necessary of office to make such a figure as became the right hand of a prime minister  I took a house to myself  and furnished it in the immediate taste  I bought an attorney s carriage at second hand  he had set it up at the suggestion of vanity  and laid it down at the suggestion of his banker  I hired a coachman and three footmen  Justice demands that old and faithful servants should be promoted  I therefore invested Scipio with the threefold honour of valet de chambre  private secretary  and steward  But the minister raised my pride to its highest pitch  for he was pleased to allow my people to wear his livery  My poor little wits were now completely turned  I was little more in my senses than the disciples of Porcius Latro  who  by dint of drinking cummin  having made themselves as pale as their master  thought themselves every whit as learned  so I could scarcely refrain from fancying myself next of kin and presumptive heir to the Duke of Lerma himself  The populace might take me for his cousin  and people who knew better  for one of his bastards  a suspicion most flattering to my pride of blood   Add to this  that after the example of his excellency  who kept a public table  I determined to give parties of my own  Pursuant thereunto  I commissioned Scipio to find me out a professed cook  and he stumbled upon one who might have dished up a dinner for Nomentanus  of dripping pan notoriety  My cellar was well stored with the choicest wines  My establishment being now complete  I gave my house warming  Every evening some of the clerks in the public offices came to sup with me  and affected a sort of political high life be low stairs  I did the honours hospitably  and always sent them home half seas over  Like master like man  Scipio  too  had his parties in the servants  hall  where he treated all his chums at my expense  But besides that I felt a real kindness for that lad  he contributed to grease the wheels of my establishment
