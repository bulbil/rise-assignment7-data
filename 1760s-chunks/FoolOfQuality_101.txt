that in the run I shall not be a loser    I sell this pamphlet for twopence   nearly two fourths thereof go to   printing  paper   c    another fourth I reserve as an equivalent for   my application and knowledge in this way   and the remainder is   a redundance which  on extraordinary tides  ought to flow to the   writer  The demand for this paper has been very uncommon     and  by what I can judge  the sale may in time amount to twelve   thousand  You need not  sir  be ashamed to acknowledge yourself   the author  Preserve but a moiety of the spirit of this Elijah   with which you have set out  and my own interests will instruct   me to serve you effectually      I now returned as in a triumphal chariot  I never before re    ceived the prize  as I may say  of personal prowess  The fortune   of my father the fortune of all men living who were merely born   to fortune diminished beneath me  O how sweet  said I to my    self  how delicious are the fruits of a man s own plantation   Then    like the sagacious and independent spider  his labours will be   crowned with personal honour and success  while he spins his sub    sistence from his proper bowels  It is then  and then only  that a   man may be said to be the true proprietor of what he possesses     and the value is endeared  and the enjoyment doubled  thereby      I hastened to impart my transports to the two loved objects of   all my cares and satisfactions  Jenny told me that her mistress   was not at home  but that Miss Arabella was above in her closet    I ran up  I tapped at the door  but no one answered  Again I     G         82 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      tapped and added the soft voice of affection  requesting to be   admitted  At length she opened  but looked pale  and with   swollen and downcast eyes  I perceived she had been in tears    and a sudden frost fell upon all my delights  What is the matter    miss  I cried   my sister  my sweet friend  my dearest Arabella     and I gently took her hand between both of mine  I wish you   had not come at this time  Mr  Clement  said she  coolly  But you   must permit me to keep my little griefs to myself  Yes  I replied    if it is your pleasure to torture  to kill me outright  refuse me my   portion in your interests and concerns  O  Mr  Clement  says she    your soul is too generous I dare not tell you   I feel what you   would suffer should you know that you are concerned in the cause   of my tears  But we must part  sir indeed  we must   we must   part  Mr  Clement  and that suddenly      Here her voice failed  and throwing herself into a chair  she   burst out afresh into a gush of affliction  while I stood astonished    and  dropping beside her on one knee  awaited with unspeakable   anguish the suspension of her grief      At length  perceiving my situation Else  sir  she cried  I entreat   you to rise and take a chair beside me  and I will tell you as fast   as I can of this distressful business      You must know that I was  a while ago  at the Miss Hodgins     They are very friendly  and good young women  and told me in   confidence  though with much concern  of a whisper in the neigh    bourhood  that my aunt had entertained a young gentleman in the   house who was admitted to such familiar and convenient intimacies    as could not  at all times  be without their consequence  especially   between persons of our age and sex      Now  Mr  Clement  I am no way ashamed to confess that I have   nothing in heaven but my innocence  nor on earth but my cha    racter  and I think you wish me better than to desire that I   should forfeit the one or the other  Desire it   O heavens   I sud    denly exclaimed  I will for ever guard them both to the last drop   of my blood  and last breath of my life   Alas   cried Arabella  you   are the man  of all others  whom the world would not admit for   my champion in this case   they are absolute judges
