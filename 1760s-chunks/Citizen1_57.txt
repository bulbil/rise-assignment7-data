 but spare  O spare  my people   An empire which has thus continued invariably the same for such a long succession of ages  which though at last conquered by the Tartars  still preserves its antient laws and learning  and may more properly be said to annex the dominions of Tartary to its empire  than to admit a foreign conqueror  an empire as large as Europe  governed by one law  acknowledging subjection to one prince  and experiencing but one revolution of any continuance in the space of four thousand years  this is something so peculiarly great  that I am naturally led to despise all other nations on the comparison  Here we see no religious persecutions  no enmity between mankind  for difference in opinion  The disciples of Lao Kium  the idolatrous sectaries of Fohi  and the philosophical children of Confucius  only strive to shew by their actions the truth of their doctrines     179Now turn from this happy peaceful scene to Europe the theatre of intrigue  avarice and ambition  How many revolutions does it not experience in the compass even of one age  and to what do these revolutions tend but the destruction of thousands  Every great event is replete with some new calamity  The seasons of serenity are passed over in silence  their histories seem to speak only of the storm   There we see the Romans extending their power over barbarous nations  and in turn becoming a prey to those whom they had conquered  We see those barbarians  when become christians  engaged in continual wars with the followers of Mahomet  or more dreadful still  destroying each other  We see councils in the earlier ages authorizing every iniquity  crusades spreading desolation in the country left  as well as that to be conquered  Excommunications freeing subjects from natural allegiance  and persuading to sedition  blood flowing in the fields and on scaffolds  tortures used as arguments to convince the recusant  to heighten the horror of the piece  behold it shaded with wars  rebellions  treasons  plots  politicks  and poison   And what advantage has any country of Europe obtained from such calamities  Scarce any  Their dissentions for more than a thousand years have served to make each other unhappy  but have enriched none  All the great nations still nearly preserve their antient limits  none have been able to subdue the other  and so terminate the dispute  France  in spite of the conquests of Edward the third  and Henry the fifth  notwithstanding the   180 efforts of Charles the fifth and Philip the second  still remains within its antient limits  Spain  Germany  Great Britain  Poland  the states of the north  are nearly still the same  What effect then has the blood of so many thousands  the destruction of so many cities  produced  Nothing neither great or considerable  The christian princes have lost indeed much from the enemies of Christendom  but they have gained nothing from each other  Their princes  because they preferred ambition to justice  deserve the character of enemies to mankind  and their priests  by neglecting morality for opinion  have mistaken the interests of society   On whatever side we regard the history of Europe  we shall perceive it to be a tissue of crimes  follies  and misfortunes  of politics without design  and wars without consequence  in this long list of human infirmity  a great character  or a shining virtue may sometimes happen to arise  as we often meet a cottage or a cultivated spot  in the most hideous wilderness  But for an Alfred  an Alphonso  a Frederic  or one Alexander III  we meet a thousand princes who have disgraced humanity   LETTER XLII  From Lien Chi Altangi  to Fum Hoam  first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin  in China   WE have just received accounts here  that Voltaire the poet and philosopher of Europe is dead  He is now beyond the reach of the thousand enemies  who while living  degraded his   181 writings  and branded his character  Scarce a  of his latter productions that does not betray the agonies of an heart bleeding under the scourge of unmerited reproach  Happy therefore at last in escaping from calumny  happy in leaving a world that was unworthy of him and his writings   Let others  my friend  bestrew the hearses of the great with panegyric  but such a loss as the world has now suffered affects me with stronger emotions  When a philosopher dies  I consider myself as losing a patron  an instructor  and a friend  I consider the world as losing one who might serve to console her amidst the desolations of war and ambition  Nature every day produces in abundance men capable of filling all the requisite duties of authority  but she is niggard in the birth of an exalted mind  scarcely producing in a century a single genius to bless and enlighten a degenerate age  Prodigal in the production of kings  governors  mandarines  chams  and courtiers  she seems to have forgotten for more than three thousand years  the manner in which she once formed the brain of a Confucius  and well it is she has forgotten  when a bad world gave him so very bad a reception   Whence  my friend  this malevolence which has
