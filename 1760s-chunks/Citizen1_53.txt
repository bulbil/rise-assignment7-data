us a picture in the lid of his snuff box  at which we all laughed  He plays picquet so very ill  and is so very fond of cards    166 and loses with such a grace  that positively he has won me  I have got a cool hundred  but have lost my heart  I need not tell you that he is only a colonel of the train bands   I am  dear Charlotte  Yours for ever  BELINDA   The Chinese lady addresses her confidant  a poor relation of the family  upon the same occasion  in which she seems to understand decorums even better than the western beauty  You who have resided so long in China will readily acknowledge the picture to be taken from nature  and  by being acquainted with the Chinese customs  will better apprehend the lady s meaning   From YAOUA to YAYA    PAPA insists upon one  two  three  four hundred taels from the colonel my lover  before he parts with a lock of my hair  Ho  how I wish the dear creature may be able to produce the money  and pay papa my fortune  The colonel is reckoned the politest man in all Shensi  The first visit he paid at our house  mercy  what stooping  and cringing  and stopping  and figeting  and going back  and creeping forward  there was between him and papa  one would have thought he had got the seventeen books of ceremonies all by heart  When he was come into the hall he flourished his hands three times in a very graceful manner  Papa  who would not be out done  flourished his four times  upon this the colonel began again  and both thus continued flourishing for some minutes in the politest manner imaginable  I was posted in the usual   167 place behind the screen  where I saw the whole ceremony through a slit  Of this the colonel was sensible  for papa informed him  I would have given the world to have shewn him my little shoes  but had no opportunity  It was the first time I had ever the happiness of seeing any man but papa  and I vow my dear Yaya  I thought my three souls would have actually have fled from my lips  Ho  but he looked most charmingly  he is reckoned the best shaped man in the whole province  for he is very fat  and very short  but even those natural advantages are improved by his dress  which is fashionable past description  His head was close shaven  all but the crown  and the hair of that was braided into a most beautiful tail  that reaching down to his heels  was terminated by a bunch of yellow roses  Upon his first entering the room  I could easily perceive he had been highly perfumed with assafoetida  But then his looks  his looks  my dear Yaya▪ were irresistible  He kept his eyes stedfastly fixed on the wall during the whole ceremony  and I sincerely believe no accident could have discomposed his gravity  or drawn his eyes away  After a polite silence of two hours  he gallantly begged to have the singing women introduced  purely for my amusement  After one of them had for some time entertained us with her voice  the colonel and she retired for some minutes together  I thought they would never have come back  I must own he is a most agreeable creature  Upon his return  they again renewed the concert  and he continued to gaze upon the wall as usual  when  in less than half an hour more  Ho  but he retired out of the room with another  He is indeed a most agreeable creature     168When he came to take his leave  the whole ceremony began afresh  papa would see him to the door  but the colonel swore he would rather see the earth turned upside down than permit him to stir a single step  and papa was at last obliged to comply  As soon as he was got to the door  papa went out to see him on horseback  here they continued half an hour bowing and cringing  before one would mount or the other go in  but the colonel was at last victorious  He had scarce gone an hundred paces from the house when papa running out halloo d after him  A good journey  Upon which the colonel returned  and would see papa into his house before ever he would depart  He was no sooner got home than he sent me a very fine present of duck eggs painted of twenty different colours  His generosity I own has won me  I have ever since been trying over the eight letters of good fortune  and have great hopes  All I have to apprehend is that after he has married me  and that I am carried to his house close shut up in my chair  when he comes to have the first sight of my face  he may shut me up a second time and send me back to papa  However I shall appear as fine as possible  Mamma  and I have been to buy the cloaths for my wedding  I am to have a new song whang in my hair  the beak of which will reach down to my nose  the milaner from whom we bought
