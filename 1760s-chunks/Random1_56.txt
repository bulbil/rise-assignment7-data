something in discourse  which would either yield me amusement or advantage —Next morning Mr  Concordance carried me to the apothecary s house  where the bargain was made  and orders given to provide an apartment for me immediately —But before I entered upon business  the school master recommended me to his taylor who gave me credit for a suit of cloaths to be paid out of the first moiety of my wages  and they were begun that very day  he afterwards accommodated me with a new hat  on the same terms  so that in a few days  I hoped to make a very fashionable appearance —In the mean time  Strap conveyed my baggage to the place allotted for me  which was a back room up two pair of stairs  furnished with a pallet for me to lie upon  a chair without a back  an earthen chamber pot without a handle  a bottle by way of candlestick  and a triangular piece of glass instead of a mirrour  the rest of its ornaments having been lately removed to one of the garrets  for the convenience of the servant of an Irish captain  who lodged in the first floor       155  CHAP  XIX   The characters of Mr  Lavement  his wife and daughter—some anecdotes of the family—the mother and daughter rivals—I am guilty of a mistake that gives me present satisfaction  but is attended with troublesome consequences   NEXT day  while I was at work in the shop  a bouncing damsel well dressed came in  on pretence of finding a vial for some use or other  and taking an opportunity when she thought I did not mind her  of observing me narrowly  went away with a silent look of disdain—I easily guessed her sentiments  and my pride took the resolution of entertaining the same indifference and neglect towards her—At dinner  the maids with whom I dined in the kitchen  gave me to understand that this was my master s only daughter  who would have a very handsome fortune  on account of which  and her beauty  a great many young gentlemen made their addresses to her—that she had been twice on the brink of marriage  but disappointed by the stinginess of her father  who refused to part with a shilling as long as he should live—for which reason the young lady did not behave to her father with all the filial veneration that might be expected  In particular  she harbour d the most perfect hatred for his countrymen  in which disposition her mother join d  who was an English woman  and by the hints   156 they dropp d  I learn d the grey mare was the better horse—that she was a matron of a high spirit  which was often manifested at the expence of her dependants  That she lov d diversions  and look d upon miss as her rival in all parties  which was indeed the true cause of her disappointments  for had the mother been hearty in her interest  the father would not have ventur d to refuse her demands —Over and above this intelligence  I of myself  soon made more discoveries  Mr  Lavement s significant grins at his wife  while she look d another way  convinc d me that he was not at all content with his lot  And his behaviour in presence of the captain  made me believe his chief torment was jealousy —As for my own part  I was consider d in no other light than that of a menial servant  and had been already six days in the house without being honour d with one word from either mother or daughter  the latter  as I understood from the maids  having at table one day  expressed some surprize that her papa should entertain such an aukward  mean looking journeyman —I was nettled at this piece of information  and next sunday   it being my turn to take my diversion  dressed myself in my new cloaths to the greatest advantage  and  vanity apart  made no contemptible figure —After having spent most part of the day in company with Strap and some of his acquaintance  I came home in the afternoon  and was let in by miss  who not knowing me  dropt a low courtesy as I advanced  which I returned with a profound bow  and shut the door—By that time I had turn d about  she had perceiv d her mistake  and chang d colour  but did not withdraw  The passage being narrow  I could not get away without   157 jostling her  so  I was forc d to remain where I was  with my eyes fix d on the ground  and my face glowing with blushes—At length her vanity coming to her assistance  she went away tittering  and I could hear her pronounce the word    creature    From this day forward  she came into the shop fifty times every day  upon various pretences  and put in practice so many ridiculous airs  that I could easily perceive her opinion of me was chang d  and that she did not think me altogether an unworthy conquest—But my heart was so steel d against her charms by pride and resentment  which were two chief ingredients in my disposition  that I remain d insensible to all her arts  and notwithstanding some advances she made  could not be prevail d upon to yield her the
