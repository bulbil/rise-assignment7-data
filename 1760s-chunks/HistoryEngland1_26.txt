a properer choice than him whom they elected  but their conduct proceeded only from a concern for themselves  and not for the people  Stephen was ready enough to consent to all their exorbitant demands  he acknowledged the crown as their gift  not his just inheritance  and confirmed all the immunities  privileges  and claims of the clergy   The kingdom now began to wear the face of an aristocracy  in which the barons and clergy might be said to command  They built castles  fortified and garrisoned them with their own troops  from whence  when offended  they would bid their Monarch defiance  Of all miseries that ever affected kingdoms  an uncontrouled power among the great is certainly the most afflictive  The tyranny of a single Monarch only falls upon the narrow circle around him  the arbitrary will of a number of delegates falls most heavily upon the lower ranks of people  who have no redress  In short  the barons clamoured for their own privileges  the clergy for their own liberty  but the people were slaves   Stephen was sensible of this  and  in order to diminish their power  possessed himself  by force  of some of their castles  which were incompatible with the safety of the kingdom   Thus we may discern three different contending powers at this time  the King and his followers  the barons and their adherents  and the clergy  assisted by the generality of the people  to these was soon added a fourth  Matilda  who claimed the crown in pursuance of Henry s command  This haughty woman  who had been wife to an Emperor  and still seemed to retain a consciousness of   76 her dignity  landed from Normandy  accompanied only by a few followers  and openly laid claim to the crown  Mean time  Stephen  being informed of her arrival  flew to besiege Arundel  a castle belonging to the Queen Dowager  where Matilda had taken up her residence  This fortress did not seem to promise a long defence  and would have been soon taken  had it not been represented to him  that  as this was a castle belonging to the Queen Dowager  it would be an infringement of the respect due to her to attempt taking it by force  There was a spirit of generosity prevalent in the times I treat of  which was unknown to their degenerate posterity  Stephen permitted Matilda to come out  and conveyed her  in safety  to Bristol  another fortress equally strong with that from whence he permitted her to retire   It is a deplorable consideration  that our virtues  often instead of being attended with happy consequences here  are found fatal to such as adhere to them without deviation  Matilda  owing her freedom merely to the generosity of the King  made no other use of it but to levy an army against him  and this army  at length  proved victorious  During the continuance of this civil war  the whole kingdom was divided  pillage and desolation were the consequence  whoever happened to be conqueror   It was at length  however  determined  by a decisive victory obtained over the King  The troops he led  were  in general  foreign mercenaries  and commanded by tumultous barons  more accustomed to command than to conquer  His horse gave way  and his infantry  being destitute of their assistance  soon followed their example  and deserted their King  All the race of the Norman conqueror were brave  Stephen  unknowing   77 how to fly  was left alone  and fought on foot in the midst of the field of battle  assaulted by multitudes  and resisting all their efforts with astonishing valour  Had his horse then railied  he might have come off victorious  He was now hemmed in on every side  but  with his battle ax  made way for some time  that breaking  he then drew out his sword  and dealt his blows round the circle in which he was inclosed  At length  after performing more than could naturally be expected from a single arm  his sword flying in pieces  he was obliged to surrender himself a prisoner  In this manner he was conducted  by the conqueror  from the field  and ignominiously laid in irons   Matilda now was proclaimed Queen  and  for some time  her power was acknowledged by the generality of the nation  But  as she disdained to accept the shadow of royalty  which was all the barons and clergy intended to grant  she disgusted them by her pride  and soon made those repent who had raised her from their levity  The Bishop of Winchester seems  at this time  to have been possessed of unbounded power  He had been chiefly instrumental in raising her to the throne  he now  therefore  levied an army  to convince her  that it was no less in his power to deprive her of a kingdom  than to put her in possession of it  He was successful in his designs  Matilda was obliged to quit England once more  and Stephen was taken from chains  and once more placed upon the throne   Again put in possession of this uneasy seat  he seemed only exalted to give new instances of his refusing the exorbitant demands of the barons and
