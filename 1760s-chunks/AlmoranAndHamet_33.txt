power  nor one on whom his transient favour has bestowed any   gift  who does not already feel his heart throb with the pangs of boding   terror  Nor is there one who  if he did not fear the displeasure of the   invisible power by whom the throne has been given to thy brother  would   not immediately revolt to thee        ALMORAN  who had hitherto remained silent  now burst into a passionate   exclamation of self pity   What can I do   said he   and whither can I   turn   Osmyn  who mistook the cause of his distress  and supposed that   he deplored only his want of power to avail himself of the general   disposition in his favour  endeavoured to fortify his mind against   despair   Your state   said he   indeed is distressful  but not   hopeless   The king who  though addressed as  HAMET  was still betrayed   by his confusion to answer as ALMORAN  smote his breast  and replied in   an agony   It is hopeless   Osmyn remarked his emotion and despair    with  a concern and astonishment that ALMORAN observed  and at once   recollected his situation  He endeavoured to retract such expressions of   trouble and despondency  as did not suit the character he hid assumed    and telling Osmyn that he thanked him for his friendship  and would   improve the advantages it offered him  he directed him to acquaint the   eunuchs that they were to admit him to ALMEIDA  When he was left alone    his doubts and perplexity held him long in suspense  a thousand   expedients occurred to his mind by turns  and by turns were rejected       His first thought was to put Osmyn to death  but he considered  that by   this he would gain no advantage  as he would be in equal danger from   whoever should succeed him  he considered also  that against Osmyn he   was upon his guard  and that he might at any time learn  from him    whatever design might be formed in favour of HAMET  by assuming HAMET S   appearance  that he would thus be the confident of every secret  in   which his own safety was concerned  and might disconcert the best   contrived project at the very moment of its execution  when it would be   too late for other measures to be taken  he determined  therefore  to   let Osmyn live  at least  till it became more necessary to cut him off    Having in some degree soothed and fortified his mind by these   reflections  he entered the apartment of ALMEIDA       His hope was not founded upon a design to marry her under the appearance   of HAMET  for that would be impossible  as the ceremony must have been   performed by the priests who supposed the marriage with HAMET to have   been forbidden by a divine command  and who  therefore  would not have   consented  even supposing they would otherwise have ventured  at the   request of HAMET  to perform a ceremony which they knew would be   displeasing to ALMORAN  but he hoped to take advantage of her tenderness   for his brother  and the particular circumstances of her situation    which made the solemnities of marriage impossible  to seduce her to   gratify his desires  without the sanction which alone rendered the   gratification of them lawful  if he succeeded in this design  he had   reason to expert  either that his love would be extinguished by   enjoyment  or that  if he should still desire to marry ALMEIDA  he   might  by disclosing to her the artifice by which he had effected his   purpose  prevail upon her to consent  as her connexion with HAMET  the   chief obstacle to her marriage with him  would then be broken for ever    and as she might  perhaps  wish to sanctify the pleasure which she might   be not unwilling to repeat  or at least to make that lawful which it   would not be in her power to prevent       In this disposition  and with this design  he was admitted to ALMEIDA    who  without suspicion of her danger  was exposed to the severest trial    in which every passion concurred to oppose her virtue  she was solicited   by all the powers of subtilty and desire  under the appearance of a   lover whose tenderness and fidelity had been long tried  and whose   passion she returned with equal constancy and ardour  and she was thus   solicited  when the rites which alone could consecrate their union  were   impossible  and were rendered impossible by the guilty designs of a   rival  in whose power she was  and from whom no other expedient offered   her a deliverance  Thus deceived and betrayed  she received him with an
