said he  can what this poor woman seems to be about  proceed from her own motion  I beg of you to say  you put her upon it  I would not have reason to imagine  that any woman  in such circumstances  could make a display of her apparel   Why  the motion is partly mine  I must needs say  answer d Charlotte   Wholly  I hope  and the compliance owing to the poor woman s mortified situation  You are young women  You may not have consider d this matter  Do you imagine  that your curiosity will yield you pleasure  Don t you know what to expect from the magnificent and bountiful spirit of him  to whose memory you owe duty   They recollected themselves  blushed  and desired Mrs  Oldham to lock up the chest  She did  and seemed pleased to be excused from the mortifying task   Ah  my Lucy  one thing I am afraid of  and that is  that Sir Charles Grandison  politely as he behaves to us all  thinks us women in general very pitiable creatures  I wish I knew that he did  and that for two reasons  That I might have something to think him blameable for  And to have the pride of assuring myself  that he would be convinced of that fault  were he to be acquainted with my grandmamma  and aunt     222 But  do you wonder  that the sisters  whose minds were thus open d and enlarged by the example of such a brother  blazing upon them all at once  as I may say  in manly goodness  on his return from abroad  whither he set out a stripling  should  on all occasions  break out into raptures  whenever they mention THEIR brother —Well may Miss Grandison despise her Lovers  when she thinks of him and of them at the same time   Sunday  Sir Charles is in town we hear  Came thither but last night—Nay for that matter  his sisters are more vexed at him than I am —But what pretence have I to be disturbed  But I say of him  as I do of Lady D   He is so good  that one would be willing to stand well with him —Then he is my Brother  you know   LETTER XXII  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   AFTER Sir Charles had inspected into everything in this house  and taken minutes of papers  letters  writings   c  and lock d up the plate  and other valuables  in one room  he order d his servants to carry into Mrs  Oldham s apartment all that belonged to her  and gave her the key of that  and directed the house keeper to be assisting to her in the removal of them  at her own time and pleasure  and to suffer her to come and go  at all times  with freedom and civility  as if she had never left the house  were his words   How the poor woman courtesied and wept  I warrant  The dear girls  I am afraid  then envied her—and perhaps expressed a grudging spirit  for they said  This was their brother s address to them at that time   You may look upon the justice I aim at doing to   223 persons who can claim only justice from me  as an earnest  that I will do more than justice to my beloved sisters  And you should have been the first to have found the fruits of the love I bear you  had I not been afraid  that prudence would have narrowed my intentions  The moment I know what I can do  I will do it  and I request you to hope  largely  If I have ability  I will exceed your hopes   My dear sisters  continued he  and took one hand of each  I am sorry  for your spirits sake  that you are left in my power  The best of women was always afraid it would be so  But the moment I can  I will give you an absolute independence on your brother  that your actions and conduct may be all your own   Surely  Sir  said Caroline  and they both wept  we must think it the highest felicity  that we are in the power of such a brother  As to our spirits  Sir—  She would have said more  but could not  and Charlotte took it up where her sister left off  Best of brothers  said she—Our spirits shall  as much as possible  I can answer for both  be guided hereafter by yours  Forgive what you have seen amiss in us—But we desire to depend upon our good behaviour  We cannot  we will not  be independent of you   We will talk of these matters  replied he  when we can do more than talk  I will ask you  Caroline  after your inclinations  and you  Charlotte  after yours  in the same hour that I know what I can do for you both  in the way of promoting them  Enter  mean time  upon your measures  Reckon upon my best assistance  Banish suspense  One of my first pleasures will be  to see you both happily married
