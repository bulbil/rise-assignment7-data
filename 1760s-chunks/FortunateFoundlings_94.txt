up in her   apartment  which she has caused to be hung with black  the windows   closed  and no light but what a small lamp affords  and only adds more   horror to the melancholy scene  she weeps incessantly  and  as she   expects her lover will obtain no mercy  declares  she only waits till   she hears the sentence of his fate is given  to dye  if possible  at the   same moment of his execution       I must confess  continued Poniatosky  the history of this lady s   sufferings touch me very much  and tho  I think her lover well worthy of   the death he will undoubtedly receive  could wish some unexpected chance   might once more set him free  and in a condition to recompence so tender   a passion  which Augustus has now no longer any power to oppose       Horatio had a heart too tender  and too sensible of the woes of love    not to be greatly affected with this passage  and as they all were   young  and probably had each of them a lady to whom their affections   were given  could not help sympathizing in the misfortunes of two   persons who seemed to have fallen into them merely by the sincere   attachment they had for each other             CHAP  XVIII        King Stanislaus quits Alranstadt to appease the troubles in Poland    Charles XII  gives laws to the empire  a courier arrives from Paris    Horatio receives letters which give him great surprize        Augustus being able to obtain no better conditions from the king of   Sweden  than leave to return to his almost ruined electorate  took leave   of his conqueror with an almost broken heart   Intelligence soon after   arriving that Poland was half demolished by the violence of different   factions  who  in the absence of both their kings  contended with equal   fury for the sovereign power  Stanislaus took an affectionate farewell   of his dear friend and patron  and went to appease the troubles of that   kingdom  and make himself peaceably acknowledged for what he was  their   lawful king  not only by election  but by the gift of the conqueror    Charles XII  of Sweden  He was attended by 10 000 Swedish horse  and   twice the number of foot  in order to make good his claim against any of   his rebellious subjects       Charles having now accomplished all he could desire in relation to the   Polish affairs  began to grow weary of the idle life he led at   Alranstadt  and was thinking which way he should turn his arms  he had   been used ill by the czar  who  as has been before observed  plotted his   destruction while a minor  and began hostilities when he thought him not   in a condition to defend himself  much less to make any reprisals  his   resentment therefore against him was no less implacable than it had been   against Augustus   But the emperor had also disobliged him  Count Zobor    the chamberlain  had taken very indecent and unbecoming liberties with   his character  in the presence of his own Ambassador at Vienna  and that   court had given shelter to 1500 Muscovites  who having escaped his arms    fled thither for protection  As he was now so near  he therefore thought   best to call the emperor first to account  and then proceed to   attack the czar       To this end he sent to demand count Zobor  and the 1500 Muscovites   should be given into his hands  the timid emperor complied with the   first and sent his chamberlain to be punished as the king thought fit    but it was not in his power to acquiesce with the other  the Roman envoy    then at Vienna  having intelligence of it  provided for their escape by   different routs  The king of Sweden then sent a second mandate    requiring protection for all the Lutherans throughout Germany    particularly in Silesia  and that they should be restored to all the   liberties and privileges established by the treaty of Westphalia  The   emperor  who would have yielded any thing to get the king of Sweden out   of his neighbourhood  granted even this  disobliging as it was to the   pope and his own catholic subjects  and having ratified these   concessions  the king vouchsafed to let his chamberlain return  without   any other punishment than imprisonment  so long as these affairs   remained in agitation       Having thus given laws to Germany and terror to the emperor  he resolved   to turn where he might expect more opposition  and accordingly he   ordered count Piper to acquaint the officers  that they must now begin   to think
