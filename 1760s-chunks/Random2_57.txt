 Who planted first  this vice on British ground    A vice  that  spite of sense and nature reigns    And poisons genial love  and manhood stains      The Earl smiled at my indignation  told me he was glad to find my opinion of the matter so conformable to his own  and that what he had advanced was only to provoke me to an answer  with which he professed himself perfectly well pleased   After I had enjoyed a long audience  I happened to look at my watch  in order to regulate my motions by it  and his lordship observing the chased case  desired to see the device  and examine the execution  which he approved with some expressions of admiration —Considering the obligations I lay under to his lordship  I thought there could not be a fitter opportunity than the present to manifest  in some shape  my gratitude    165 I therefore begged he would do me the honour to accept of the watch as a small testimony of the sense I had of his lordship s generosity  but he refused it in a peremptory manner  and said he was sorry I should entertain such a mercenary opinion of him  observing at the same time  that it was the most beautiful piece of workmanship he had ever seen  and desiring to know where he could have such another —I begged a thousand pardons for the freedom I had taken  which I hoped he would impute to nothing else than the highest veneration for his person—let him know that as it came to my hand by accident in France  I could give him no information about the maker  for there was no name on the inside  and once more humbly entreated that he would indulge me so far as to use it for my sake —He was still positive in refusing it  but was pleased to thank me for my generous offer  saying  it was a present that no nobleman needed be ashamed of receiving  though he was resolved to shew his disinterestedness with regard to me  for whom he had conceived a particular friendship  and insisted  if I was willing to part with the watch  upon knowing what it cost  that he might at least indemnify me  by refunding the money  On the other hand  I assured his lordship  that I would look upon it as an uncommon mark of distinction  if he would take it without further question  and rather than disoblige me  he was at last persuaded to put it in his pocket  to my no small satisfaction  who took my leave immediately  after having received a kind squeeze  and an injunction to depend upon his promise   Buoyed up with my reception  my heart opened  I gave away a guinea among the lacqueys  who   166 escorted me to the door  flew to the lodgings of Lord Straddle  upon whom I forced my diamond ring  as an acknowledgment for the great service he had done me  and from thence hied myself home  with an intent of sharing my happiness with honest Strap —I determined  however  to heighten his pleasure by depressing his spirits at first  and then bringing in the good news with double relish —For this purpose  I affected the appearance of disappointment and chagrin  and told him in an abrupt manner  that I had lost the watch and diamond  Poor Hugh  who had been already harrassed into a consumption by intelligence of this sort  no sooner heard these words  than  unable to contain himself  he cried with distraction in his looks     God in heaven forbid  —  I could carry on the farce no longer  but laughing in his face  told him every thing that had befallen  as above recited  His features were immediately unbended  and the transition so affecting  that he wept with joy  calling my Lord Strutwell by the appellations of Jewel  Phoenix  Rara avis  and praising God  that there was still some virtue left among our nobility —Our mutual congratulations being over  we gave way to our imagination  and anticipated our happiness by prosecuting my success through the different steps of promotion  till I arrived at the rank of a prime minister  and he to that of my first secretary     Intoxicated with these ideas I went to the ordinary  where  meeting with Banter  I communicated the whole affair in confidence to him  concluding with an assurance that I would do   167 him all the service in my power —He heard me to an end with great patience  then regarding me a good while with a look of disdain  pronounced     So  your business is done  you think  —   As good as done  I believe   said I   —   I ll tell you  replied he  what will do it still more effectually—A halter— Sdeath  if I had been such a gull to two such scoundrels as Strutwell and Straddle  I would without any more ado tuck myself up    Shocked at this exclamation  I desired him with some confusion to explain himself  Upon which he gave me to understand  that Straddle was a poor contemptible wretch  who lived by borrowing and pimping to his fellow peers  that in consequence of this
