be brought to town as this night  I have order d it to an undertaker s  I must lock myself up for a day or two  when I go to town  His concerns are large  but he told me  not intricate  He desired  that his will might not be opened  till after his interrment  and that that might be private  He has two nephews  and a niece  I would have had him join them in the trust with me  But he refused to do so  An attempt once had been made upon his life  by villains set at work by a wicked brother  father of those nephews  and that niece  of which they were innocent  They   252 are worthy young people  I had the happiness to save his life  But had no merit in it  for my own safety was involved in his  I am afraid he has been too grateful   But  my good brother  said Miss Grandison  were you not a little reserved on this occasion  You went and returned  and went and returned  to Canterbury  and never said one word to us of the call you had to go thither  For my part  I thought there was a Lady in the case  I do assure you   My reserve  as you call it  Charlotte  was rather accidental  than designed  and yet I do now and then treat your agreeable curiosity as mariners are said to do a whale  I throw out a tub  But this was too melancholy an occasion to be sported with  I was affected by it  Had the gentleman lived to come to town  you would all have been acquainted with him  I love to communicate pleasure  but not pain  when  especially  no good end can be answered by the communication  I go to different places  and return  and hardly think it worth troubling my sisters with every movement  Had I thought you had any curiosity about my little journeyings to Canterbury  you should have had it answered  And yet I know my sister Charlotte loves to puzzle  and find out secrets where none are intended   She blush d  and so did I  Your servant  Sir  was all she said   But  Charlotte  proceeded he  you thought it was a Lady that I visited  You know not your brother  I never will keep a secret of that nature from you  my good Lord  nor from you  my sisters  when I find myself either encouraged or inclined to make a second visit  It is for your Sex  Charlotte to be very chary of such secrets  and reason good  if you have any doubt  either of the man s worthiness  or of your own consequence with him   He looked very earnestly at her  but smiled     253 So  my brother  I thank you  humourously rubbing one side of her face  tho  she needed not to do so  to make both cheeks glow  this is another box on the same car  I have been uneasy  I can tell you  Sir  at an hint you threw out before you last went to Canterbury  as if I kept you from something that it behoved you to know  Now  pray  Sir  will you be pleased to explain yourself   And  since you put it so strongly to me  Charlotte  let me ask you  Have you not   And let me ask you  Sir—Do you think I have   Perhaps  Charlotte  your solicitude on this subject  now  and the alarm you took at the time  on a very slight hint  might warrant—  No warrants  brother —Pray be so good as to speak all that lies on your mind   Ah  Charlotte  and looked  tho  smilingly  with meaning   I will not bear this Ah  Charlotte  and that meaning look   And are you willing  my dear  to try this cause   I demand my tryal   Charming innocence  thought I  at the time—Now shall I find some fault  I hope  in this almost perfect brother  I triumphed in my mind  for my Charlotte   Who shall be your judge   Yourself  Sir   God grant you may be found guilty  cousin  said Mr  Grandison  for your plaguing of me   Has that wretch  looking at Mr  Grandison  insinuated any thing —She stopt   Are you afraid  my sister   I would not give that creature any advantage over me   Sir Ch  I think I would  if there were fair room—You have too often all the game in your own hands  You should allow Mr  Grandison his chance     254Miss Gr  Not to arise from such an observing bystander  as my brother   Sir Ch  Conscious  Charlotte   Miss Gr  May be not—  Sir Ch  May be  is doubtful  May be No  implies May be Yes   Lady L  You have made Charlotte uneasy  Indeed  brother  you have  The poor girl has been harping upon this string  ever since you have been
