shall be   satisfied       But I shall get out of my depth  my shallow mind cannot comprehend    as it ought  these weighty subjects  Let me only therefore pray  that    after having made a grateful use of God s mercies here  I may  with my   dear benefactor  rejoice in that happy state  where is no mixture    no unsatisfiedness  and where all is joy  and peace  and love  for   evermore       I said  when we sat at supper  The charming taste you gave me  sir  of   your poetical fancy  makes me sure you have more favours of this kind   to delight me with  if you please  and may I beg to be indulged on this   agreeable head  Hitherto  said he  my life has been too much a life of   gayety and action  to be busied so innocently  Some little essays I have   now and then attempted  but very few have I completed  Indeed I had not   patience nor attention enough to hold me long to any one thing  Now and   then  perhaps  I may occasionally shew you what I have essayed  But I   never could please myself in this way          Friday       We were yesterday favoured with the company of almost all the   neighbouring gentlemen and their ladies  who  by appointment with   one another  met to congratulate our happiness  Nothing could be more   obliging  more free and affectionate  than the ladies  nothing more   polite than the gentlemen  All was performed  for they came to supper    with decency and order  and much to every one s satisfaction  which   was principally owing to good Mrs  Jervis s care and skill  who is an   excellent manager       For my part  I was dressed out only to be admired  as it seems  and   truly  if I had not known  that I did not make myself  as you  my dear   father  once hinted to me  and if I had had the vanity to think as well   of myself  as the good company was pleased to do  I might possibly have   been proud  But I know  as my Lady Davers said  though in anger  yet in   truth  that I am but a poor bit of painted dirt  All that I value myself   upon  is  that God has raised me to a condition to be useful  in my   generation  to better persons than myself  This is my pride  And I hope   this will be all my pride  For what was I of myself   All the good I can   do  is but a poor third hand good  for my dearest master himself is but   the second hand  God  the all gracious  the all good  the all bountiful    the all mighty  the all merciful God  is the first  To him  therefore    be all the glory       As I expect the happiness  the unspeakable happiness  my ever dear and   ever honoured father and mother  of enjoying you both here  under this   roof  so soon   and pray let it be as soon as you can   I will not enter   into the particulars of the last agreeable evening  For I shall have a   thousand things  as well as that  to talk to you upon  I fear you will   be tired with my prattle when I see you       I am to return these visits singly  and there were eight ladies here of   different families  Dear heart  I shall find enough to do   I doubt   my time will not be so well filled up  as I once promised my dear   master   But he is pleased  cheerful  kind  affectionate  O what a happy   creature am I   May I be always thankful to God  and grateful to him       When all these tumultuous visitings are over  I shall have my mind  I   hope  subside into a family calm  that I may make myself a little useful   to the household of my dear master  or else I shall be an unprofitable   servant indeed       Lady Davers sent this morning her compliments to us both  very   affectionately  and her lord s good wishes and congratulations  and she   desired my writings per bearer  and says  she will herself bring them   to me again  with thanks  as soon as she has read them  and she and her   lord will come and be my guests  that was her particularly kind word    for a fortnight       I have now but one
