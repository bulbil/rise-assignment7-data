I live  I will fall into whatever Course of reading you think proper  as I shall always be pleased with adopting your Sentiments  or modelling mine by them  as far as my poor  little Capacity will admit  But let me beg you not to attempt curing me of the Pain  which your Absence will ever give me  for  as nothing but Indifference can render me easy in that Particular  be assured it is out of your Power to make me so   Notwithstanding your Situation  which I know requires your Presence  I very seriously and sincerely wish you here  at this and every Moment  There is no saying how far the Weakness of my Body affects my Mind  Perhaps my being disqualified for every other Pleasure and Satisfaction  makes me feel your Loss more strongly  Be that as it will  I cannot help thinking it a little melancholy to be left in the forlorn  unsettled Way  I am  in my present Condition  Page  253 How is the Time fixed for your Coming  when my falling ill is so uncertain  And sure you need not grudge me the Happiness of seeing you a little sooner than  perhaps  my latest Moment  However  if it is inconvenient  I relinquish your Promise  for I shall always prefer your Interest to my Satisfaction  nor can I receive any Joy from the Thoughts of your coming with Reluctance to me   Adieu   my Heart s dear Harry   LETTER CCLXXX   My dear FANNY   YOUR Observation upon — is extremely just  and expressed in a very pretty Turn and Manner  and  tho  I did not flatter myself in the Way you have taken it  yet that may rather be his Reason  than none at all  for  as to the Objection he makes  with regard to the Expence  I think my Letters sufficiently proved that the Expence of my Scheme would be considerably less than his own Plan   Your Remark upon — puts me in mind of a Passage of Sir Francis Bacon s Treatise upon the Wisdom of the Antients  where he labours to give a new Moral to the old Fables of Antiquity  Juno is said to be woo d by Jupiter  Page  254 in the Form of a Cuckow  upon which he makes the following Comment    That Men often impede their own Success by Ostentation of superior Merit  and that especially with Persons  who have more Arrogance and Pride  intimated by the Character of Juno  than Sense or Merit  The surest Way to win their Favour is  to appear as mean and humble  both in Virtue and outward Appearance  as possible     The whole Treatise  which I am now quoting from  is  in my Opinion  a very poor Performance  and much below so great a Man  The Morals drawn from the Tales of the Pantheon are wretchedly forced  and many of them improperly adapted  His Stile is ordinary  and Expressions paltry   My dearest Life  you cannot surely think  that I would not rather be with you  even in Town  than from you  even here  Why then do you seem to upbraid me  Oh  never  never do so again  Be assured this once for all  and then never let a Doubt or Surmise disturb your Breast  that I never stay a Day from you  but when it is necessary I should  both for your present Security and future Happiness  You can surely calculate pretty near the Time  you would most particularly desire my Attendance  and it will certainly be Time enough for me to go up then  If I should go at present  perhaps I should Page  255 be  for many Reasons  under a Necessity of leaving you  at that Time  I should most wish to be with you  Thus your own Impatience would disappoint your End  I shewed the same Impatience in desiring you to come down  but I have been uneasy  ever since  about it  as I am apprehensive the Attempt would be extremely hazardous  and the Journey too fatiguing  and an unlucky Contretemps might happen in the Country  before you could be able to return again  I hope this Letter will reach you Time enough to prevent you  or  rather  I hope your Prudence has corrected my Indiscretion already  There are many Reasons  too  against your coming at present  which  however material in themselves  are Considerations too insignificant to mention  after the Objection  I have made  of your Danger   I am  indeed I am  tout a vous Seul   LETTER CCLXXXI   My Dear FANNY   AS to the Conversation with —  I should be much obliged  if you would let me know who was the second Person  which  upon my Honour  I shall never mention either to him or the other  and this you may be assured of  Page  256 both upon your Account and mine  It may be of Use to me to know his Confident upon this Occasion  but only so  if I keep my Mind to myself   Such Expressions  as he made Use of  though the same that you quoted  may very well bear a different Sense from what Mistake
