cousin Byron  to reform such a man  and make his great fortune a blessing to multitudes  as I am sure would be your endeavour to do  were you Lady Pollexfen   But  my Lucy  were Sir Hargrave king of one half of the globe  I would not go to the altar with him   But if he be a very troublesome man  what shall I say to him  I can deal pretty well with those  who will be kept at arms length  but I own  I should be very much perplex d with resolute wretches  The civility I think myself obliged to pay every one who prosesses a regard for me  might subject me to inconveniencies with violent spirits  which  protected as I have been by my uncle Selby  and my good Mr  Deane  I never yet have known  O my Lucy  to what evils  but for that protection  might I not  as a sole  an independent young woman  have been exposed  Since men  many men  are to be look d upon as savages    85 as wild beasts of the desart  and a single and independent woman they hunt after as their proper prey   To have done with Sir Hargrave for the present  and I wish I may be able to say  for ever  early in the morning  a billet was brought from him to Mr  Reeves  excusing himself from paying him a visit that morning  as he had intended  by reason of the sudden and desperate illness of a relation  whose seat was near Reading  with whom he had large concerns  and who was desirous to see him before he died  As it was impossible that he could return under three days  which  he said  would appear as three years to him  and he was obliged to set out that moment  he could not dispense with himself for putting in his claim  as he called it  to Miss Byron s favour  and confirming his declaration of yesterday  In very high strains  he professed himself her admirer  and begg d Mr  and Mrs  Reeves s interest with her  One felicity  he said  he hoped for from his absence  which was  that as Miss Byron  and Mr  and Mrs  Reeves  would have time to consider of his offers  he presum d to hope he should not be subjected to a repulse   And now  my Lucy  you have before you as good an account as I can give you of my two new Lovers  How I shall manage with them  I know not  But I begin to think that those young women are happiest  whose friends take all the trouble of this sort upon them  only consulting their daughters inclinations as preliminaries are adjusting   My friends indeed pay an high compliment to my discretion  when they so generously allow me to judge for myself  And we young women are fond of being our own mistresses  But I must say  that to me this compliment has been  and is a painful one  for two reasons  That I cannot but consider their goodness as a task upon me  which requires my utmost circumspection  as well as gratitude  and that they have shewn more generosity in dispensing with their authority    86 than I have done whenever I have acted so as to appear  tho  but to appear  to accept of the dispensation  Let me add besides  that now  when I find myself likely to be addressed to by mere strangers  by men who grew not into my knowlege insensibly  as our neighbours Greville  Fenwick  and Orme  did  I cannot but think it has the appearance of confidence  to stand out to receive  as a creature uncontroulable  the first motions to an address of this awful nature  Awful indeed might it be called  were one s heart to incline towards a particular person   Allow me then for the future  my revered grandmamma  and you  my beloved and equally honoured uncle and aunt Selby  allow me  to refer myself to you  if any person offers to whom I may happen to have no strong objections  As to Mr  Fowler  and the Baronet  I must now do as well as I can with them  It is much easier for a young woman to say No  than Yes  But for the time to come I will not have the assurance to act for myself  I know your partiality for your Harriet  too well  to doubt the merit of your recommendation   As Mr  and Mrs  Reeves require me to shew them what I write  they are fond of indulging me in the employment  You will therefore be the less surpris d that I write so much in so little a time  Miss Byron is in her Closet  Miss Byron is writing  is an excuse sufficient  they seem to think  to every body  because they allow it to be one to them  But besides  I know they believe they oblige you all by the opportunity they so kindly give me of shewing my Duty and Love  where so justly due   I am  however  surpris d at casting my eye back —Two sheets
