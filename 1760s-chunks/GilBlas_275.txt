hand  He advanced towards me  saying    Signor Gil Blas  behold in me one of your old friends  I am Don Andrew de Tordesillas  in the Archbishop of Grenada s service while you enjoyed that prelate s favour  You may recollect engaging his interest in my behalf  and thereby procuring me a post in Mexico  but instead of embarking for the Indies  I stopped in the town of Alicant  There I married the governor s daughter  and by a series of adventures of which you shall hereafter have the particulars  I am now warden of this tower  It is expressly forbidden me to let you speak to any living soul  to give you any better bed than straw  or any other sustenance than bread and water  But besides that your misfortunes interest my humanity  you have done me service  and gratitude countervails the harshness of my orders  They think to make me the instrument of their cruelty  but it is my better purpose to soften the rigour of your captivity  Get up and follow me   Though my humane keeper was entitled to some acknowledgment  my spirits were so affected as to interdict my speech  All I could do was to attend him  We crossed a court  and mounted a narrow staircase to a little room at the top of the tower  It was no small surprise  on entering  to find a table with lights on it  neatly set out with covers for two  They will serve up immediately  said Tordesillas  We are going to sup together  This snug retreat is appointed for your lodging  it will agree better with you than your cell  From your window you will look down on the flowery banks of the ErÃªma  and the delicious vale of Coca  bounded by the mountains which divide the two Castiles  At first you will care little for prospects  but when time shall have softened your keener sensations into a composed melancholy  it will be a pleasure to feast your eyes on such engaging scenes  Then  as for linen and other necessaries befitting a man accustomed to the comforts of life  they shall be always at your service  Your bed and board shall be such as you could wish  with a plentiful supply of books  In a word  you shall have everything but your liberty   My spirits were a little tranquillized by these obliging offers  I took courage and returned my best thanks  assuring him that his generous conduct restored me to life  and that I hoped at some time or other to find an opportunity of testifying my gratitude  To be sure  and why should you not  answered he  Did you fancy yourself a prisoner for life  Nothing less likely  and I would lay a wager that you will be released in a very few months  What say you  Signor Don Andrew  exclaimed I  Then surely you are acquainted with the occasion of my misfortune  You guess right  replied he  The alguazil who brought you hither told me the whole story in confidence  The king  hearing that the Count de Lemos and you were in the habit of escorting the Prince of Spain by night to a house of suspicious character  as a punishment for your loose morals  has banished the count  and sent you hither  to be treated in the style of which you have had a specimen  And how  said I  did that circumstance come to the king s knowledge  That is what I am most curious to ascertain  And that  answered he  is precisely what the alguazil did not tell  apparently because he did not know   At this epoch of our conversation  the servants brought in supper  When everything was set in order  Tordesillas sent away the attendants  not wishing our conversation to be overheard  He shut the door  and we took our seats opposite to each other  Let us say grace  and fall to  said he  Your appetite ought to be good after two days of fasting  Under this impression he loaded my plate as if he had been cramming the craw of a starveling  In fact  nothing was more likely than that I should play the devil among the ragouts  but what is likely does not always happen  Though my intestines were yearning for support  their staple stuck in my throat  for my heart loathed all pleasurable indulgence in the present state of my affairs  In vain did my warden  to drive away the blue devils  pledge me continually  and expatiate on the excellence of his wine  imperishable nectar would have been pricked according to the fastidious report of my palate  This being the case  he went another way to work  and told me the story of his marriage  with as much humour as such a subject would admit  Here he was still less successful  So wandering was my attention  that before the end I had forgotten the beginning and the middle  At length he was convinced that there was no diverting my gloomy thoughts for that evening  After finishing his solitary supper  he rose from table  saying  Signor de Santillane  I shall leave you to your repose  or rather to the free indulgence of your own reveries  But  take my word for it  your misfortune will not be
