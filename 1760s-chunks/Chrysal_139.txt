 that a little after she had finished her story she happened to   look at her watch   but it was down  and so she asked me what   o clock it was by mine  that she might set by it  and I remember   it wanted exactly six minutes of four          Pray  let me look at your watch   have you not altered it since           No  my dear  But why do you ask           Because it is nine minutes faster than mine  and it was just   half an hour past four by his watch  as they told me  when he died    and his and mine were exactly together  so that the six minutes   which your watch wanted of fovir  and the nine minutes it is faster   than mine  make a quarter before four  which was three quarters   before he died  This is most wonderful  for there could be no design   or art in it  This is most wonderful   But there have been many   revelations made in dreams  even in our own times  as for instance    that in Drelinoourt   for it could be no other than a dream   and   that other of the great Duke of Buckingham s rise  and afterwards   of his death  as it is most judiciously and faithfully represented by   the Reverend Historian   not to mention many more  As to the   doctor s living  my dear  I make you a compliment of it   you may   give it to whom you please  Though the curate is a very learned   and good man  and has a large family  beside that  he has been   recommended to me by the whole parish  whom his long residence   among them â€” for he has been there above thirty years â€” has made   love and respect him as a father          Then let them provide for him  like dutiful children  What   assurance   to pretend to dictate to you  as if you were not the   proper judge of such matters  If it was for no other reason  I   would not give it to him  to teach them their duty and distance   another time          There may be something in that  I do not like such interfering     1 Eohard          148 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     in my conduct neither   and therefore you may give it to whom you   please  And her husband is a man of learning and good character    too  who will not discredit any preferment   but take care that you   do not anything improper  As to your wager  there is no harm   in that   but even so  it should be kept a secret  I must know   nothing of the matter          I thank you  my dear lord  I shall be sure to observe your   directions   and the accomplishment of this part of the dream I   take a happy presage of the rest  But you must not be wanting to   yourself  You had better  I think  go to her grace  and see what   may offer to promote our hopes          That is not a bad thought  my dear   but it grows late   in the   morning we shall see what is to be done        Saying this  they withdrew whither we must not follow them     for of the genial bed   with most mysterious reverence I deem            CHAPTER XLVI     HISTOBY OF THE DREAMER â€” SHE LOSES HER WAGES  WHICH SHE   PAYS WITH PLEASURE â€”  HIS LORDSHIP WAITS UPON HER GRACE â€”   HIS KNOWLEDQE OF THE WORLD PROMOTES A NOBLE INSTANCE OF   CHARITY â€” OHRYSAL ENTERS INTO THE SERVICE OF HER GRACE     I HAVE observed your surprise and admiration at the ready presence   of mind and confidence of my late mistress  who could  in a moment    invent such a story  and persist in it so steadily  as not only to   impose upon the bishop s easy credulity  but even upon his   wife also  who was  in a manner  in the secret of her design  but   could not interrupt my story to satisfy it sooner by giving you her   history      She was a distant relation to a noble lord  on whom the extrava    gance of her father left her dependent  This occasioned her being   taken into his family  where she lived several years as a humble   companion to his lady  As
