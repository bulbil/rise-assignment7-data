pocket pistols the day before  and who  making known his misfortune to a nobleman he met on the road  assuring him  his non resistance was altogether owing to his consideration for the ladies in the coach  procured the assistance of his Lordship s servants to go in quest of the plunderer —This holiday captain scampered up to me with great address  and asked who fired the pistol which he had heard —As I had not yet recovered my reason  he  before I could answer  observed a body lying on the ground  at which sight  his colour vanished  and he pronounced with a faultering tongue    Gentlemen  here s murder committed I Let us alight  —   No  no  said one of his followers  let us rather pursue the murderer —Which way went he  young man  —  By this time  I had recollected myself so far as to tell them he could not be a quarter of a mile before them  and beg one of them to assist me in conveying the corps of my friend to the next   60 house  in order to its being interred —The captain foreseeing that in case he pursued  he must soon come to action  began to curb his horse  and give him the spur at the same time  which made the creature rear up and snort in such a manner  that he called out  his horse was frightened and would not proceed  at the same time wheeling him round and round  stroaking his neck  whistling and wheedling him with   Sirrah  sirrah—gently  gently   c  —   Z—ds   cries one of the servants  sure my Lord s Sorrel is not resty  —  With these words  he bestowed a lash on his buttocks  and Sorrel disdaining the rein  sprung forward with the captain at a pace that would have soon brought him up with the robber  had not the girth  happily for him  given way  by which means he landed in the dirt  and two of his attendants continued their pursuit  without minding his situation in the least —Mean while one of the three who remained at my desire  turning the Body of Strap to one side  in order to see the wound which had killed him  found him still warm and breathing  whereupon I immediately let him blood  and saw him  with inexpressible joy  recover  having received no other wound than what his sear inflicted —Having got him upon his legs  we walked together to an inn  about half a mile from the place  where Strap being not quite recovered  went to bed  and in a little time after  the third servant returned with the captain s horse and furniture  leaving himself to crawl after as well as he could  This Gentleman of the sword upon his arrival  complained grievously of the bruise occasioned by his fall  and on the recommendation of the servant    61 who warranted my ability  I was employed to bleed him  for which he rewarded me with half a crown     The time between this and dinner  I passed in observing a game at cards  between two farmers  an exciseman  and a young fellow in a rusty gown and cassock  who  as I afterwards understood  was curate of a neighbouring parish —It was easy to perceive that the match was not equal  the two farmers being partners  having to do with a couple of sharpers  who stript them of all their cash in a very short time —But what surprised me very much  was to hear this clergyman reply to one of the countrymen who seemed to suspect foul play  in these words     D—n me  friend  d ye question my honour  —  I did not at all wonder to find a cheat in canonicals  this being an animal frequent in my own country  but I was scandalized at the indecency of his behaviour  which appeared in the oaths he swore  and the baudy songs which he sung —At last  to make amends  in some sort  for the damage he had done the unwary boos  he pulled out a fiddle from the lining of his gown  and promising to treat them with a dinner  began to play most melodiously  singing all the while in concert —This good humour of the parson inspired the company with so much glee  that the farmers soon forgot their losses  and all hands went to dancing in the yard  While we were agreeably amused in this manner  our musician spying a horseman riding towards the inn  stopt all of a sudden  crying out    Gad so  gentlemen  I beg your pardon  there s our dog of a doctor coming into the inn  —  And immediately concealed his instrument  and ran towards the gate  where he took hold of the   62 vicar s bridle  and helped him off  enquiring very cordially into the state of his health —This rosy son of the church  who might be about the age of fifty  having alighted  and entrusted the curate with his horse  stalked with great solemnity into the kitchen  where  sitting down by the fire  he called for a bottle of ale and a pipe  scarce deigning an answer to the
