head  holding a bottle to my nose  my nostrils sore with hartshorn  and a strong smell of burnt feathers  but no man near me   Where am I  Who are you  madam  And who are you  Where am I  Were the questions I first asked   The women were a mother and two daughters  The mother answered  You are not in bad hands   God grant you say truth  said I   No harm is intended you  only to make you one of the happiest of women  We would not be concerned in a bad action   I hope not  I hope not  Let me engage your pity  madam  You seem to be a mother  These young gentlewomen  I presume  are your daughters  Save me from ruin  I beseech you  madam  Save me from ruin  as you would your daughters   These young women are my daughters  They are sober and modest women  No ruin is intended you    211 One of the richest and noblest men in England is your admirer  He dies for you  He assures me that he intends honourable marriage to you  You are not engaged  he says  And you must and you shall be his  You may save murder  madam  if you consent  He resolves to be the death of any Lover whom you encourage   This must be the vile contrivance of Sir Hargrave Pollexsen  immediately cried I out  Is it not  Is it not  Tell me  I beg of you to tell me   I arose  and sat on the bed side  and at that moment in came the vile  vile Sir Hargrave   I screamed out  He threw himself at my feet  I reclined my head on the bosom of the elderly person  and by hartshorn and water they had much ado to keep me out of a fit  Had he not withdrawn  had he kept in my sight  I should certainly have fainted  But holding up my head  and seeing only the women  I revived  And began to pray  to beg  to offer rewards  if they would facilitate my escape  or procure my safety  But then came in again the hated man   I beg of you  Miss Byron  said he  with an air of greater haughtiness than before  to make yourself easy  and hear what I have to say  It is in your own choice  in your own power  to be what you please  and to make me what you please  Do not therefore needlesly terrify yourself  You see I am a determined man  Ladies  you may withdraw—  Not and leave me here —And as they went out  I pushed by the mother  and between the daughters  and followed the foremost into the parlour  and then sunk down on my knees  wrapping my arms about her  O save me  save me  said I   The vile wretch entered  I left her  and kneeled to him  I knew not what I did  I remember  I said  wringing my hands  If you have mercy  If you have compassion  let me now  now  I beseech you  Sir  this moment  experience your mercy     212 He gave them some motion  I suppose  to withdraw  for by that time the widow and the other daughter were in the parlour   and they all three retired   I have besought you  madam  and on my knees too  to shew me mercy  but none would you shew me  inexorable Miss Byron  Kneel  if you will  in your turn kneel  supplicate  pray  you cannot be more in earnest  than I was  Now are the tables turned   Barbarous man  said I  rising from my knees  My spirit was raised  But it as instantly subsided  I beseech you  Sir Hargrave  in a quite frantic way  wringing my hands  and coming near him  and then running to the window  and then to the door  without meaning to go out at either  had they been open  for whither could I go   and then again to him  Be not  I beseech you  Sir Hargrave  cruel to me  I never was cruel to any body  You know I was civil to you  I was very civil—  Yes  yes  and very determined  You called me no names  I call you none  Miss Byron  You were very civil  Hitherto I have not been uncivil  But remember  madam—But  sweet and ever adorable creature  and he clasped his arms about me  your very terror is beautiful  I can enjoy your terror  madam—And the savage would have kissed me  My averted head frustrated his intention  and at his feet I besought him not to treat the poor creature whom he had so vilely betrayed  with indignity   I don t hit your fancy  madam   Can you be a malicious man  Sir Hargrave   You don t like my morals  madam   And is this the way  Sir Hargrave  are these the means you take  to convince me
