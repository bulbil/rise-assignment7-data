 After this  he made his will  and the   lawyer  perceiving he had left but few legacies  asked him how the   residue of what he was possessed of should be disposed  to which he   replied   greatly as I have been wronged by Lady Mellasin  I would not   have her starve  I have been calculating in my mind to what her dividend   may amount  and believe it will be sufficient to enable her to live in   that retired manner which best becomes her age and character        Mr  Goodman  thus having settled all his affairs in this world  began to   make such preparations for another as are necessary for the best of men    In the mean time  as the least noise was disturbing to him  it was   judged proper that Miss Betsy  who could not live without company    should remove  No boarding place to her mind being yet found  and having   done with all hopes of living with her brother   as she was by this time   informed of the true reasons he had for her not doing so  took lodgings   in Jermyn Street  and finding the interest of her fortune  through the   good management of her guardian  would allow it  hired a maid and   foot boy to wait upon her       The adieu she received from Mr  Goodman was the most tender and   affectionate that could be  she was very much moved with it  and   sincerely lamented the loss she should sustain of so honest and worthy a   friend  but her natural sprightliness would not suffer any melancholy   reflections to dwell long upon her mind  and the hurry she was in of   sending messages to all her acquaintance  with an account of the change   of her situation  very much contributed to dissipate them  This   important business was scarce over  and she well settled in her new   habitation  when one of Mr  Goodman s footmen brought her a letter from   her brother Frank  which had been just left for her by the post  It   contained these lines             To Miss Betsy Thoughtless            My dear sister            I have been snatched from the brink of the grave  by the skill of        one of the best physicians in the world  and the tender  and  I may        say  maternal care of our most dear  and truly valuable friend  the        excellent Lady Trusty  The first use I make of my recovered health         is to give an account of it to those whom  I flatter myself  will        be obliged by the intelligence  I thank you for the many kind        wishes you have sent me during the course of my illness  but hoped        to have seen  before now  another name subscribed to your letters        than that you received from your birth  and cannot help saying  I        am a little surprized  that in the two last you favoured me with         you have been entirely silent on a subject you know I have always        had very much at heart  I have also very lately received a letter        from Mr  Trueworth  wherein he tells me  he is going to his        country seat  expresses the most kind concern for me  but mentions        not the least syllable of you  or of his passion  I fear  my dear        sister  there is some misunderstanding between you  which would        very much trouble me  for your sake especially  but I shall defer        what I have to say to you till I have the pleasure of seeing you  I        am not yet judged fit to sit my horse for so long a journey  and        the places in the stagecoach are all taken for to morrow  but have        secured one in Thursday s coach  and expect to be with you on        Saturday  I accompany this to you with another one to my brother         and another to Mr  Goodman  so have no occasion to trouble you with        my compliments to either  Farewel  I think I need not tell you that        I am  with an unfeigned regard
