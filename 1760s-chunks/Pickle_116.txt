expression antic and unnatural  Doctor  you have seen my judgment of  Solomon  I think I may  without presumption  but  I don t choose to make  comparisons  I leave that odious task to other people  and let my works  speak for themselves  France  to be sure  is rich in the arts  but  what is the reason  The king encourages men of genius with honour and  rewards  whereas  in England  we are obliged to stand on our own feet   and combat the envy and malice of our brethren  Egad  I have a good mind  to come and settle here in Paris  I should like to have an apartment in  the Louvre  with a snug pension of so many thousand livres    In this manner did Pallet proceed with an eternal rotation of tongue   floundering from one mistake to another  until it was the turn of  Poussin s Seven Sacraments to be examined  Here again  the Swiss  out  of the abundance of his zeal  expressed his admiration  by saying these  pieces were impayable  when the painter  turning to him  with an air of  exultation   Pardon me  friend  there you happen to be mistaken  these  are none of Impayable s  but done by Nicholas Pouseen  I have seen  prints of them in England  so that none of your tricks upon travellers   Mr  Swiss or Swash  or what s your name   He was much elated by this  imaginary triumph of his understanding  which animated him to persevere  in his curious observations upon all the other pieces of that celebrated  collection  but perceiving that the doctor manifested no signs of    6 22 15  3 45 PM   pleasure and satisfaction  but rather beheld them with a silent air of  disdain  he could not digest his indifference  and asked  with a waggish  sneer  if ever he had seen such a number of masterpieces before  The  physician  eyeing him with a look of compassion  mingled with contempt   observed that there was nothing there which deserved the attention  of any person acquainted with the ideas of the ancients  and that  the author of the finest piece now in being was unworthy to clean the  brushes of one of those great masters who are celebrated by the Greek  and Roman writers    O lad  O lad   exclaimed the painter  with a loud laugh   you have  fairly brought yourself into a dilemma at last  dear doctor  for it is  well known that your ancient Greek and Roman artists knew nothing at  all of the matter  in comparison with our modern masters  for this good  reason  because they had but three or four colours  and knew not how to  paint with oil  besides  which of all your old fusty Grecians would you  put upon a footing with the divine Raphael  the most excellent Michael  Angelo  Bona Roti  the graceful Guido  the bewitching Titian  and above  all others  the sublime Rubens  the     He would have proceeded with  a long catalogue of names which he had got by heart for the purpose   without retaining the least idea of their several qualifications  had  not he been interrupted by his friend  whose indignation being kindled  by the irreverence with which he mentioned the Greeks  he called  him blasphemer  Goth  Boeotian  and  in his turn  asked with great  vehemence  which of those puny moderns could match with Panaenus of  Athens  and his brother Phidias  Polycletus of Sicyon  Polygnotus  the  Thracian  Parrhasius of Ephesus  surnamed Abrodiaitos  or the Beau  and  Apelles  the prince of painters  He challenged him to show any portrait  of these days that could vie with the Helen of Zeuxis  the Heraclean  or  any composition equal to the Sacrifice of Iphigenia  by Timanthes   the Sicyonian  not to mention the Twelve Gods of Asclepiodorus  the  Athenian  for which Mnason  tyrant of Elatea  gave him about three  hundred pounds apiece  or Homer s Hell  by Nicias  who refused sixty  talents  amounting to upwards of eleven thousand pounds  and generously  made a present of it to his own country  He desired him to produce a  collection equal to that in the temple of Delphos  mentioned in the   Ion  of Euripides  where Hercules and his companion Iolaus  are  represented in the act of killing the Lernaean hydra with golden  sickles  kruseais harpais  where Bellerophon appears on his winged  steed  vanquishing the fire breathing chimera  tan puripneousan  and the  war of the giants is described  Here Jupiter stands wielding the red hot  thunderbolts  keraunon amphipuron  there Pallas  dreadful to the view   Gorgopon  brandishes her spear against the huge Euceladus  and Bacchus   with slender ivy rods  defeats and slays the ges teknon  or the mighty  son of earth   The painter was astonished and confounded at this rhapsody of names and  instances  which was uttered with surprising eagerness and rapidity
