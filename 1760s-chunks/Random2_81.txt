my want of merit  I am unworthy to possess thy charms  which heaven hath destined for the arms of some more favoured being  —  She guessed the cause of my disquiet  upbraided me gently for my suspicion  and gave me such flattering assurances of her eternal fidelity  that all my doubts and fears forsook me  and peace and satisfaction reigned within my breast     At midnight I left the kind nymph to her repose  and being let out by Miss Williams  at the garden gate by which I entered  began to explore my way homeward in the dark  when I heard at my back a noise like that of a baboon when he mows and chatters  I turned instantly  and perceiving something black  concluded I was discovered by some spy  employed to watch for that purpose  Arroused at this conjecture  by which the reputation of the virtuous Narcissa appeared in jeopardy  I drew my sword  and would have sacrificed him to her same  had not the voice of Strap restrained my arm  It was with great difficulty he could pronounce     D—d—d—do  mum—um—um—murder me  if you please    Such an effect had the cold upon his jaws  that his teeth rattled like a   241 pair of castanets—Pleased to be thus undeceived  I laughed at his consternation  and asked what brought him thither  Upon which he gave me to understand  that his concern for me had induced him to dodge me to that place  where the same reason had detained him till now  and he frankly owned  that in spite of the esteem he had for Miss Williams  he began to be very uneasy about me  considering the disposition in which I went abroad  and if I had staid much longer  would have certainly alarmed the neighbourhood in my behalf —The knowledge of this his intention confounded me  I represented to him the mischievous consequences that would have attended such a rash action  and cautioning him severely against any such design for the future  concluded my admonition with an assurance  that in case he should ever act so madly  I would  without hesitation put him to death —   Have a little patience  cried he  in a lamentable tone  your displeasure will do the business  without your committing murder  —  I was touched with this reproach  and as soon as we got home  made it my business to appease him  by explaining the cause of that transport  during which I had used him so unworthily     Next day when I went into the long room  I observed several whispers circulate all of a sudden  and did not doubt that Melinda had been busy with my character  but I consoled myself with the love of Narcissa  upon which I rested with the most perfect confidence  and going up to the rowly powly table  won a few pieces from my suspected rival  who with an easy politeness  entered into conversation with me  and desiring my company to the coffee house  treated me with   242 tea and chocolate —I remembred Strutwell  and guarded against his insinuating behaviour  nor was my suspicion wrong placed  he artfully turned the discourse upon Narcissa  and endeavoured  by hinting at an intrigue he pretended to be engaged in elsewhere  to learn what connexion there was between her and me —But all his finesse was ineffectual  I was convinced of his dissimulation  and gave such general answers to his inquiries  that he was forced to drop the subject and talk of something else   While we conversed in this manner  the savage came in  with another gentleman  who introduced him to his lordship  and he was received with such peculiar marks of distinction  that I was persuaded the courtier intended to use him in some shape or another  and thence I conceived an unlucky omen —But I had more cause to be dismayed the following day  when I saw the Squire in company with Melinda and her mother  who honoured me with several disdainful glances  and when I afterwards threw myself in his way  instead of the cordial shake of the hand  returned my salute with a cold repetition of    Servant  servant    which he pronounced with such indifference  or rather contempt  that if he had not been Narcissa s brother I should have affronted him in publick     These occurrences disturbed me not a little  I foresaw the brooding storm  and armed myself with resolution for the occasion  but Narcissa being at stake  I was far from being resigned —I could have renounced every other comfort of life with some degree of fortitude  but the prospect of losing her  disabled all my philosophy  and tortured my soul into madness     243 Miss Williams found me  next morning  full of anxious tumult  which did not abate  when she told me  that my Lord Quiverwit  having professed honourable intentions  had been introduced to my lovely Mistress by her brother  who had at the same time  from the information of Melinda  spoke of me as an Irish fortune hunter  without either birth or estate to recommend me  who supported myself in the appearance of a gentleman by sharping  and other infamous practices  and who was of such an obscure origin
