 sentiments and intentions would put a total end to all future   correspondence between them  and  having looked it over  after he had   finished  and found it such as he thought proper for the purpose  put it   under a cover  with all the letters he had received from Miss Flora  not   excepting the first invitation she had made him  under the tide of the    Incognita   and sent away the packet by a porter  for he had never   intrusted the servants with the conveyance of any epistle from him to   that lady       Miss Flora  from the moment her eyes were open in the morning   if it   can be supposed she had any sleep that night  had been watching  with   the most racking impatience  for the arrival of Mr  Trueworth s   messenger  She wished  but dreaded more  the eclaircissement which she   expected would be contained in the mandate he had promised to send  yet   was distracted for the certainty  how cruel soever it might prove       At length it came  and with it a confirmation of even worse than the   most terrible of her apprehensions had suggested  The sight of her own   letters  on her opening it  almost threw her into a swoon  but  when her   streaming eyes had greedily devoured the contents of the billet that   accompanied them  excess of desperation struck her for some moments   stupid  and rendered her mind inactive as her frame       But  when awakened from this lethargy of silent grief  she felt all the   horrors of a fate she had so much dreaded  Frustrated at once in every   hope that love or interest had presented to her  words cannot paint the   wildness of her fancy  she tore her hair and garments  and scarce spared   that face she had taken so much pains to ornament  for wanting charms to   secure the conquest it had gained       But with the more violence these tourbillions of the mind rage for a   while  the sooner they subside  and all is hushed again  as I remember   to have somewhere read             After a tempest  when the winds are laid        The calm sea wonders at the wreck it made        So this unhappy and abandoned creature  too much deserving of the fate   she met with  having exhausted her whole stock of tears  and wasted all   the breath that life could spare in fruitless exclamations  the passions   which had raised these commotions in her soul became more weak  and the   beguiler Hope once more returned  to lull her wearied spirits into a   short lived ease       She now saw the folly of venting her rage upon herself  that to give way   to grief and despair would avail her nothing  but only serve to render   her more miserable  that  instead of sitting tamely down  and meanly   lamenting her misfortune in the loss of a lover  on whom she had built   so much  she ought rather to exert all the courage  resolution  and   artifice  she was mistress of  in contriving some way of preventing it    if possible        He is not yet married   said she   the irrevocable words are not yet   past  I have already broke off his courtship to one woman  why may I not   be as successful in doing so with another  He cannot love the present   engrosser of his heart more than he did Miss Betsy Thoughtless  It is   worth  at least  the pains of an attempt        The first step she had to take towards the execution of her design  was   to find out the name  condition  and dwelling  of her happy rival  and   this  she thought  there would be no great difficulty in doing  as she   doubted not but Mr  Trueworth visited her every day  and it would be   easy for her to employ a person to watch where he went  and afterwards   to make the proper enquiries       But  in the mean time  it required some consideration how to behave to   that gentleman  so as to preserve in him some sort of esteem for her    without which  she rightly judged  it would be impossible for her ever   to recover his love  in case she should be so fortunate as to separate   him from the present object of his flame       She knew very well  that all testimonies of despair in a woman no longer   loved  only create uneasiness in the man who occasioned it  and but   serve to make him more heartily wish to get
