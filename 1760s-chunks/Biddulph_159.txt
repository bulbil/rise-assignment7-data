  ‘Why was I not made acquainted with this precious design of marrying my friend to that insinuating little viper  I might perhaps have prevented the mischief  for I cannot think if she had not imposed upon you  that you would have pushed your chimerical notions of honour to such extremities   ‘Perhaps you meant well  but it has ever been your peculiar misfortune I think to have your good intentions productive of nothing but evil  this last action I fear will be a severe proof of the truth of this observation  I warned you in time against this woman  but my advice has always been despised   ‘I will say no more on the hateful subject  what is done is irrevocable  but I believe you will hardly be able to answer it to yourself  if you find that you have condemned one of the noblest fellows in the world to the arms of a prostitute ’  Lord bless me  my Cecilia  was there ever such a barbarian  with what an implacable aversion does he pursue this poor girl  But what does he mean by the odious epithet with which he closes his horrid letter  Sure Miss Burchell merits not that name  Her weakness in regard to Mr Faulkland cannot bring on her so detestable a charge  If George knows any thing more of her character than I do  why did he not tell me so before  It cannot be  his aversion to her makes him cruel and unjust  He says true  I should not indeed forgive myself if I were the means of making Mr Faulkland unhappy  and his observation would be dreadfully verified  that all my good intentions produce nothing but evil  if this marriage should prove to be unfortunate     July 20  I have had a letter from Mrs Faulkland  She and her husband are arrived safely at his estate on the borders of the north of Ireland  within less than thirty miles of the capital  It is a pleasant part of the country she says  but as Mr Faulkland has no house there  they have taken up their lodgings for the present at the house of his steward  Her letter is filled with declarations of the felicity she enjoys  she says  she would not change her lot to be the greatest Queen on earth —May she continue to deserve her happy fortune  and to render her husband as satisfied with his lot as she is with hers  then shall I triumph over Sir George for his vile insinuations   I have heard from my good lady V——  in answer to the letter I wrote her  giving an account of Mr Faulkland’s marriage  As he had not made her acquainted with his return to England  I knew not whether he had informed her of this particular  and I find he had not  As lady V—— was a stranger to his former connection with Miss Burchell  with whom I have already told you she was acquainted  and that she entertained a very favourable opinion of her  she expressed no displeasure at the alliance  but said  she supposed he married  in a tifft  upon my refusal of him  for which I gave her such reasons as I had before given Mr Faulkland  excepting those which related to Miss Burchell  which  for both their sakes  must now be no more mentioned  Lady V—— says  she will not condemn the delicacy of my sentiments  though she owns her wish was  that it could have been got over  as she is sure that Mr Faulkland can never be happy with any one but me   Here follows an interval of near two months  in which nothing material occurred   September 13 The time approaches  my Cecilia  when thy friend shall be poor and destitute  I know thy generous heart will more than sympathize with me in my calamity  from the aggravating reflexion that it is not in your power to assist me  The account you have given me of your husband’s close disposition has too fully convinced me of this  Nor should I have mentioned my apprehensions to you at this time  but that I am bound not to conceal a thought from the friend of my heart   Sir George has dropt all correspondence with us  I have nothing to expect from him  nor does that mortal live  yourself excepted  to whom I would  on such an occasion  be indebted  I have already    sighed too often under the weight of obligations which I could not repay   My mother is hastening apace to a better world  She sees her end approaching with such a calmness  such a truly pious joy  as almost makes me ashamed of lamenting her loss  for what is it in me  my dear but selfishness  ’Tis true  the loss of a tender parent  a faithful friend  at a time when all other comforts of life are fled  is an evil one would wish wholly to avoid  or at least to postpone for the longest date possible  but when I consider her welfare  ought I to indulge myself in such a wish  Her life is already become a burden to her  her infirmities are painful  and without hope of cure  she longs to be released  and to receive that reward of her righteousness  which cannot be obtained on this side
