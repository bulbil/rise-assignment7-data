you say  with Regard to the Saints  Martyrs  Virgins   c  is not only Idolatry  in general  but that particular Species of it imbibed by the Church with it s Nurse s Milk  for the Page  109 assigning separate Charges to them  over Nations  Trades  Distempers  Perils by Land and Water   c  is the same Error among Roman Catholics  which Theologicians attribute to the Heathen Romans  who are said to have worshipped the only true God  but mistook every Attribute for a distinct Deity   I shall trouble you no farther now  upon these Subjects  but conclude  that  if Religion be your Trade  I would have you stick to it  for a better you cannot get  for that Purpose  But  if it is your Science  quit it for a more virtuous and rational one  and you can hardly go amiss  I am  in true Christian Charity   Dear Brother   Your s   c  E  K   LETTER CCXIX   My Dearest FANNY   I HAVE filled one Letter so full of Business  that I had not Room to take Notice of the pretty Part of your last  but I shall not suffer the Post to go out without a Letter  intirely in Answer to the refined Scruples you hint at in your s   Page  110Your Love for me does not destroy your present Happiness  but rather constitutes it  Those Apprehensions  and that Uneasiness  which sometimes afflict you  are not  indeed  Part of your Happiness  but are the natural Consequence of it  in tender and delicate Minds  for Absence  or Fear of losing  affects us always  in Proportion to the Height of our Enjoyments  Now those who desire their Pleasures to be less  in order to rid themselves of their Pains  know not what they wish for  Apathy is a wretched Exchange for fond Sensations  even with all their Incumbrances  and to prefer such an Indolence of Mind is  as if a Man should refuse an Estate  because it was subject to Quit Rent   As for your extraordinary Notion  that perhaps your Love and Fondness for me may affect your Happiness hereafter  this must be your own Fault  and not the Nature of the Thing  if it should  The Love of God  and the Love of Man  are very different Things  and both made our express Duties  by distinct Commandments  Therefore the latter cannot become a Crime  of the Nature you apprehend  even by it s Excess  for parallel Lines can never interfere  though extended infinitely  But the smallest Portion of mortal Love  or any other worldly Affection  rises into a Sin  when it intersects  or runs counter to our Love of God  the Duties of Religion  or the Morals of Virtue  Now Page  111 there is nothing  surely  in our chaste  sincere  and constant Regards  toward each other  which can possibly violate any of these high Concerns  but rather strengthen us in them  by inspiring our Hearts with the most grateful Sense  toward Providence  and possessing our Minds with the warmest Devotion and Thanksgiving  to the Almighty  for our mutual Happiness   To a Mind rightly formed  the Paths of Heaven are strewn with Roses  not stuck with Thorns    For Heaven is paid  when Man receives   T enjoy is to obey   And the Possession of all the Pleasures of Life  bounded by Reason and Religion  beyond which alone we taste the Bitterness of the Draught  leads us not a Step out of the Road to Happiness hereafter  referring every thing to God  hymning out his Praise  and submitting ourselves implicitly  and humbly  to the Justice  Goodness  and Wisdom of the divine Dispensations  whenever Heaven shall think fit to withdraw any of it s free Gifts from us     As for the Concern and Unhappiness we shall unavoidably feel upon the Disappointment or Loss of those Things  which our fond Hearts are set upon here  you need not moralize so rigidly upon this Subject  for this Grief  like the Sighs and Tears which are the Consequence of bodily Pain  will be attributed  by him who Page  112 made us  to the Weakness of that Nature with which he was pleased to cloath our Souls  and  in either Case  it is not our Feelings  but the Repinings  Impatience  or Despondency  which create the Crime   You see I have here renewed the Strain of our former Correspondence  for I am always pleased to enter into Subjects with you  whenever you give me an Opportunity  and  if you would more frequently write to me  in such a Manner as your last Letter  to shew the Delicacy of your Sentiment  and the Excellency of your Heart  you would do yourself infinite Service  in the Improvement of your own Mind and Virtue  in the Securing of my Love and Esteem  and  at the same Time  afford the most extreme Pleasure and Pride to my dearest Fanny s constant  sincere  and fond Husband   Henry   LETTER CCXX   My Dearest HARRY   I THANK you for both your kind Letters — They are
