 I had imposed upon you  Your trouble is now   almost at an end  for I have written my intentions to Mr  Williams   so particularly  that I need say the less here  because he will not   scruple  I believe  to let you know the contents of my letter  I have   only one thing to mention  that if you find what I have hinted to him   in the least measure disagreeable to either  you assure them both  that   they are at entire liberty to pursue their own inclinations  I hope you   continue your civilities to the mistrustful  uneasy Pamela  who now will   begin to think better of hers and  Your friend  etc           I had hardly time to transcribe these letters  though  writing so much    I write pretty fast  before they both came up again in high spirits  and   Mr  Williams said  I am glad at my heart  madam  that I was beforehand   in my declarations to you  this generous letter has made me the happiest   man on earth  and  Mrs  Jewkes  you may be sure  that if I can procure   this fair one s consent  I shall think myself  I interrupted the good   man  and said  Ah  Mr  Williams  take care  take care  don t let  There   I stopt  and Mrs  Jewkes said  Still mistrustful   I never saw the like   in my life   But I see  said she  I was not wrong  while my old orders   lasted  to be wary of you both  I should have had a hard task to prevent   you  I find  for  as the saying is  Nought can restrain consent of   twain       I doubted not her taking hold of his joyful indiscretion   I took her   letter  and said  Here  Mrs  Jewkes  is yours  I thank you for it  but   I have been so long in a maze  that I can say nothing of this for the   present  Time will bring all to light   Sir  said I  here is yours    May every thing turn to your happiness  I give you joy of my master s   goodness in the living   It will be dying  said he  not a living    without you   Forbear  sir  said I  while I have a father and mother  I   am not my own mistress  poor as they are  and I ll see myself quite at   liberty  before I shall think myself fit to make a choice       Mrs  Jewkes held up her eyes and hands  and said  Such art  such   caution  such cunning  for thy years   Well   Why  said I   that he   might be more on his guard  though I hope there cannot be deceit in   this   twould be strange villany  and that is a hard word  if there   should   I have been so used to be made a fool of by fortune  that I   hardly can tell how to govern myself  and am almost an infidel as to   mankind  But I hope I may be wrong  henceforth  Mrs  Jewkes  you shall   regulate my opinions as you please  and I will consult you in every   thing   that I think proper  said I to myself   for  to be sure  though   I may forgive her  I can never love her       She left Mr  Williams and me  a few minutes  together  and I said    Consider  sir  consider what you have done   Tis impossible  said he    there can be deceit  I hope so  said I  but what necessity was there   for you to talk of your former declaration  Let this be as it will  that   could do no good  especially before this woman  Forgive me  sir  they   talk of women s promptness of speech  but  indeed  I see an honest heart   is not always to be trusted with itself in bad company       He was going to reply  but though her task is said to be ALMOST  I took   notice of that word  at an end  she came up to us again  and said  Well    I had a good mind to show you the way to church to morrow  I was glad of   this  because  though in my present doubtful situation I should not have   chosen it  yet I would have encouraged her proposal  to be able to judge   by her being in earnest or otherwise  whether one might depend upon the   rest  But Mr  Williams again indiscreetly helped
