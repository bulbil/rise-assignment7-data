solicite favour of him in his camp  almost at his feet    but whatever were his sentiments on this occasion he concealed them  and   tho  he could not but despise such an act of meanness  he treated him   with the utmost politeness  tho  without making any abatement of the   demands he had exacted from him  On the contrary  he insisted on his   delivering up to him general Patkul  ambassador from the czar  who at   that time was a prisoner in Saxony  being determined to put him to death   as a traitor  having been born his subject  and now entered into the   service of his sworn enemy       Augustus beseeched him in the most abject manner to relinquish this one   point  and remonstrated to him that the czar  his present master  would   look on it as the utmost indignity offered to himself in the person of   his ambassador  he assured him he hated Patkul  but feared the giving   him up would be resented by all the princes of Europe  All he could urge   on this head was to no effect  the king of Sweden was not to be moved   from any resolution he had once made  and the unfortunate Patkul was   sent to Alranstadt and chained to a stake for three whole months  and   afterwards conducted to Casimir  where he was to receive his sentence       Horatio  who was an entire stranger to the motive of this behaviour in   the king  and had never seen any thing before in him that looked like a   cruel disposition  was one day mentioning his surprize at it to a young   officer with whom he had contracted a great intimacy  on which he gave   him the following account       This Patkul  said he  is a Livonian born  which  tho  a free country  is   part of the dominions annexed to the crown of Sweden  Charles XI  began   to introduce a more absolute form of government than was consistent with   the humour of that people  his son has been far from receding in that   point  and Patkul being a person of great consideration among them    stood up for their liberties in a manner which our king could not   forgive   he ordered him to be seized  but he made his escape  and was   proscribed in Sweden  on which he entered into the service of king   Augustus  and was made his general  but on some misunderstanding    between him and the chancellor  he quitted Poland and went to Russia    where he got into great favour with the czar  was highly promoted  and   sent his residentiary ambassador in Saxony  Augustus  whose fate it has   been to disoblige every body  on some pretence clapp d into prison the   representative of his only friend  and now  we see  has given him up to   death  to satiate the demands of his greatest enemy       Horatio could not keep himself from falling into a deep musing at the   recital of this adventure  he thought Patkul worthy of compassion  yet   found reasons to justify the king s resentment  and as this officer had   often disburthened himself to him with the greatest freedom  he had no   reserve toward him  and this led them into a discourse on arbitrary   power   Horatio said  that he could not help believing that nature never   intended millions to be subjected to the despotic will of one person    and that a limited government was the most conformable to reason  The   officer agreed with him in that  except the person who ruled had really   more perfections than all those he ruled over and if so  said he  and   his commands are always calculated for the happiness of the subject    they cannot be more happy than in an implicite obedience  True  replied   Horatio  I am confident that such a prince as ours knows how to chuse   for his people much better than they do for themselves  but how can they   be certain that his descendants will have the same virtues  and when   once an absolute power is granted to a good prince  it will be in vain   that the people will endeavour to wrest it from the hands of a bad   one   Never can any point be redeemed from the crown without a vast   effusion of blood  and the endangering such calamities on the country    that the relief would be as bad as the disease  Upon the whole    therefore  I cannot think Patkul in the wrong for attempting to maintain   the liberty of his country  tho  I do for entering into the service of   the avowed enemy of his master       It is that  I believe  resumed the other  that the king chiefly resents    his majesty
