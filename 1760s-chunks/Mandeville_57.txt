    2 55       had long been a stranger  I tried every method to find out to whom I was indebted for an act of such exalted friendship  but in vain  till one day  a relation being present  of whom I had some suspicion  I related the story  as of another  keeping my eyes fixed upon him  he remained perfectly unmoved  but  happening to turn my head  I saw a confusion in the air of a young lady in the room  with whom I had been bred in the greatest intimacy  which excited all my attention  She saw me observe her  and a blush overspread her cheek  which convinced me I had found the object of my search  I changed the subject  and the next morning made her a visit  when I with great difficulty drew from her a confession  that   having long had a tender esteem for me  she had  by a friend in town  watched all my actions  that my banker had applied to that very friend to purchase my estate  on which  seeing me on the brink of absolute ruin  she        2 56       had taken what appeared to her the most probably means to prevent it  and was so happy as to see she had succeeded      I dare say  I need not tell you this noble creature was my dear Mrs  Herbert  the smallness of whose fortune added infinitely to the generosity of the action  what she had sent me being within a trifle her all        I loved  I addressed her  and  at length  was so happy as to call her mine  Blest in the most exalted passion for each other  a passion which time has rather encreased than abated  the narrowness of our circumstances is the only ill we have to complain of  even this we have borne with chearfulness  in the hope of happier days  A late accident has  however  broke in upon that tranquillity with which Heaven has hitherto blest us  It is now about six months since a Lady  who tenderly esteemed us both  sent for me  and acquainted me she had          2 57       procured for me of a gentleman  whose family had been obliged to her  a living of above three hundred pounds a year  in a beautiful situation  and desired I would immediately take orders  As I was originally educated with a view to the church  I consented with inexpressible joy  blessing that Heaven  which had thus rewarded my Sophia s generous affection  and given us all that was wanting to compleat our happiness  I set out for London with an exulting heart  where  after being ordained  I received the presentation  and went down to take possession  The house was large and elegant  and betrayed me into furnishing it rather better than suited my present circumstances  but  as I determined on the utmost frugality for some years  I thought this of little consequence  I set men to work in the garden  and wrote my wife an account of our new residence  which made her eager to hasten her removal  The day of my coming for my family was fixed         2 58       when my patron came down to this seat  which was within sight of the rectory  I waited on him  and found him surrounded by wretches to whom it was scarce possible to give the name of human  profligate  abandoned  lost even to the sense of shame  their conversation wounded reason  virtue  politeness  and all that mankind agreed to hold sacred  My patron  the wealthy heir of a West Indian  was raised above them  only by fortune and a superior degree of ignorance and savage insensibility  He received me with an insolence  which I found great difficulty in submitting to  and  after some brutal general reflexions on the clergy  dared to utter expressions relating to the beauty of my wife  which fired my soul with indignation  breathless with rage  I had not power to reply  when  one of the company speaking low to him  he answered aloud  Hark you  Herbert  this blockhead thinks a parson a gentleman  and wonders        2 59       at my treating  as I please  a fellow who eats my bread      I will sooner want bread  Sir  said I  rising  than owe it to the most contemptible of mankind  Your living is once more at your disposal  I resign all right to it before this company        The pleasure of having acted as I ought swelled my bosom with a conscious delight  and supported me till I reached home  when my heart sunk at the thought of what my Sophia might feel from the disappointment  Our affairs too were a little embarrassed  from which misery I had hoped to be set free  instead of which my debts were increased  Mr  Mandeville  if you never
