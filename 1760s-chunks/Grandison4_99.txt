to be made monkeys of   BUT all other subjects must now give way  We have heard of  tho  not from  my brother  A particular friend of Mr  Lowther was here with a Letter from that gentleman  acquainting us  that Sir Charles and he were arrived at Paris   Mr  Beauchamp was with us when Mr  Lowther s friend came  He borrowed the Letter on account of the extraordinary adventure mentioned in it   Make your heart easy  in the first place  about Sir Hargrave  He is indeed in town  but very ill  He was frighted into England  and intends not ever again to quit it  In all probability  he owes it to my brother that he exists   Mr  Beauchamp went directly to Cavendish Square  and informed himself there of other particulars relating to the affair  from the very servant who was present and acting in it  and from those particulars and Mr  Lowther s Letter  wrote one for Dr  Bartlett  Mr  Beauchamp obliged me with the perusal of what he wrote  whence I have extracted the following account  For his Letter is long and circumstantial  and I did not ask his leave to take a copy  as he seemed desirous to hasten it to the doctor   On Wednesday the 19 30 of April  in the evening  as my brother was pursuing his journey to Paris  and was   247 within two miles of that capital  a servant man rode up  in visible terror  to his post chaise  in which were Mr  Lowther and himself  and besought them to hear his dreadful tale  The gentlemen stopt  and he told them  that his master  who was an Englishman  and his friend of the same nation  had been but a little while before attacked  and forced out of the road in their post chaise  as he doubted not  to be murdered  by no less than seven armed horsemen  and he pointed to a hill  at distance  called Mont Martre  behind which they were  at that moment  perpetrating their bloody purpose  He had just before  he said  addressed himself to two other gentlemen  and their retinue  who drove on the faster for it   The servant s great coat was open  and Sir Charles observing his livery  asked him  If he were not a servant of Sir Hargrave Pollexfen  and was answered in the affirmative   There are  it seems  trees planted on each side the road from St  Denis to Paris  but which  as France is an open and uninclosed country  would not  but for the hill  have hindered the seeing a great way off  the scuffling of so many men on horseback  There is also a ditch on either hand  but places left for owners to come at their grounds  with their carts  and other carriages  Sir Charles ordered the post boy to drive to one of those pass ges  saying  He could not forgive himself  if he did not endeavour to save Sir Hargrave  and his friend  whose name the man told him was Merceda   His own servants were three in number  besides one of Mr  Lowther  My brother made Mr  Lowther s servant dismount  and  getting himself on his horse  ordered the others to follow him  He begged Mr  Lowther to continue in the chaise  bidding the dismounted servant stay  and attend his master  and galloped a way towards the hill  His ears were soon pierced with the cries of the poor wretches  and   248 presently he saw two men on horseback holding the horses of four others  who had under them the two gentlemen  struggling  groaning  and crying out for mercy   On the approach of Sir Charles  who was a good way a head of his servants  he calling out to spare the gentlemen  and bending his course to relieve the prostrate sufferers  two of the four quitted their prey  and mounting  joined the other two horsemen  and advanced to meet Sir Charles  with a shew of supporting the two men on foot in their violence  who continued laying on the wretches  with the but ends of their whips  unmercifully   As the assailants offered not to fly  and as they had more than time enough to execute their purpose  had it been •obbery and murder  Sir Charles concluded  it was likely that these men were actuated by a private revenge  He was confirmed in this surmise  when the •our men on horseback  tho  each had his pistol ready drawn  as Sir Charles also had his  demanded a conference  warning Sir Charles how he provoked his fate by his rashness  and declaring  that he was a dead man if he fired   Forbear  then  said Sir Charles  all further violences to the gentlemen  and I will hear what you have to say   He then put his pistol into his holster  and one of his servants being come up  and the two others at hand  to whom he called out  not to fire till they had his orders   he gave him his horse s reins  bidding him have an eye to the holsters
