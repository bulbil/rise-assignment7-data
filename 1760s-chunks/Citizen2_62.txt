times thanked the town for their unmerited applause  They soon became mutually enamoured of each other s talents  they wrote  they felt  they challenged the town for each other  Johnson assured the public that no poet alive had the easy simplicity of Jacob  and Jacob exhibited Johnson as a master piece in the pathetic  Their mutual praise was not without effect  the town saw their plays  were in raptures  read  and without censuring them  forgot them  So formidable an union  however  was soon opposed by Tibbald  Tibbald asserted that the tragedies of one had faults  and the comedies of the other substituted wit for vivacity  the combined champions flew at him like tygers  arraigned the censurer s judgment  and impeached his sincerity  It was a long time a dispute among the learned  which was in fact the greatest man  Jacob  Johnson or Tibbald  they had all written for the stage with great success  their names were seen in almost every paper  and their works in every coffee house  However  in the hottest of the dispute  a fourth combatant made his appearance  and swept away the three combatants  tragedy  comedy and all into undistinguished ruin   From this time they seemed consigned into the hands of criticism  scarce a day passed in which they were not arraigned as detested writers  The critics  these enemies of Dryden and Pope  were their enemies  So Jacob and Johnson  instead of mending by criticism  called it envy  and because Dryden and Pope were censured  they compared themselves to Dryden and Pope     193But to return  the weapon chiefly used in the present controversy is Epigram  and certainly never was a keener made use of  They have discovered surprising sharpness on both sides  The first that came out upon this occasion was a kind of new composition in this way  and might more properly be called an epigrammatic thesis  than an Epigram  It consists  first  of an argument in prose  next follows a motto from Roscommon  then comes the the epigram  and lastly  notes serving to explain the Epigram  But you shall have it with all its decorations   An EPIGRAM  Addressed to the Gentlemen reflected on in the ROSCIAD  a Poem  by the Author    Worry d with debts and past all hopes of bail   His pen he prostitutes t avoid a goal     ROSCOM    Let not the hungry Bavius  angry stroke  Awake resentment  or your rage provoke   But pitying his distress  let virtue  1  shine   And giving each your bounty   2 let him dine   For thus retain d  as learned council can   Each case  however bad  he ll new japan   And by a quick transition  plainly show   Twas no defect of your s  but pocket low    That caus d his putrid kennel to o erflow    The last lines are certainly executed in a very masterly manner  It is of that species of argumentation  called the perplexing  It effectually flings the antagonist into a mist  there s no answering it  the laugh is raised against   194 him  while he is endeavouring to find out the jest  At once he shews  that the author has a kennel  and that this kennel is putrid  and that this putrid kennel overflows  But why does it overflow  It overflows  because the author happens to have low pockets   There was also another new attempt in this way  a prosaic Epigram which came out upon this occasion  This is so full of matter  that a critic might split it into fifteen Epigrams  each properly fitted with its sting  You shall see it   To G  C  and R  L     Twas you  or I  or he  or all together    Twas one  both  three of them  they know not whether   This I believe  between us great or small   You  I  he  wrote it not— twas Churchill s all   There  there s a perplex  I could have wished  to make it quite perfect  the author  as in the case before  had added notes  Almost every word admits a scholium  and a long one too  I  YOU  HE  Suppose a stranger should ask  and who are you  Here are three obscure persons spoken of  that may in a short time be utterly forgotten  Their names should have consequently been mentioned in notes at the bottom  But when the reader comes to the words great and small  the maze is inextricable  Here the stranger may dive for a mystery  without ever reaching the bottom  Let him know then that small is a word purely   195 introduced to make good rhyme  and great was a very proper word to keep small company   Yet by being thus a spectator of others dangers  I must own I begin to tremble in this literary contest for my own  I begin to fear that my challenge to Doctor Rock was unadvised  and has procured me more antagonists than I had at first expected  I have received private letters from several
