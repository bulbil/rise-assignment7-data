      380 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      Just then the surgeon arrived  and I heard him hastily asking   where the marquis was  On entering  he said I am sorry for   your misfortune  my lord  but matters may be better than we   apprehend   arid immediately he took out his case of instruments    One of the ruffians  said the marquis  before I was aware  came   behind  and run me through the back      The surgeon then ripped open his lordship s waistcoat  and   changed colour on seeing his shirt drenched in blood  But getting   him quickly undressed  and having probed his wound  he struck his   hands together  and cried Courage  my friends   it is only a flesh   business   the weapon has passed clear of the ribs and vitals      As soon as the marquis s wound was dressed  and that we had   got him to bed I fancy  sir  said I to the surgeon  I may have   some small occasion for a cast of your office   I feel a little smart   in my sword arm      On stripping  he found that a chance thrust had entered about   half an inch into the muscle above my elbow  and had ripped up   some of the skin  But he quickly applied the proper dressing    and I was preparing to take my leave  when the marquis cried   out You must not think of parting  my dear friend  you are   the master of the master here  and lord of this house  and of all   that is in it      The surgeon then ordered his lordship to compose himself as   soon as possible   and  having wished him a good night  I sent   Tirlah to my lodgings to let my people know that I was well  and   in friendly hands  I was then conducted by the domestics to a   superb apartment  where a bed was prepared  and where a small   supper of elegancies lay fuming on the sideboard      Having swallowed a few bits  with a glass or two of wine  I rose   and sauntered through the room  musing on my Louisa  heavily   sighing  and nearly despairing of being ever able to find her      Some time after I sat down  to undress and get to bed  when   a number of the officers of justice silently entered my chamber    seized my sword that I had put off  and  coming whisperingly to me    commanded me to accompany them  without making any noise      I saw that it was madness to resist   and  as I went with them    I observed that two of the family liveries had joined themselves to   the officers  It then instantly occurred that I was in the house of   my rival  that the marquis was the very person to whom my   Louisa had been destined   that I was somehow discovered   and   they were conducting me to the Bastille  of which 1 had heard as   many affrighting stories as are usually told of the Inquisition      Ah  traitor   said I to myself  is it thus you serve the man who   but now saved your life at the expense of his own blood   Let no   one hereafter trust to the bleating of the lamb  or the courting of   the turtle   the roaring of the lion  and the pounces of the vulture    may thus deceitfully lurk under the one and the other      After passing some streets  they took me to a large house  where   dwelt one of their chief magistrates  being also a member of their   parliament  Having knocked respectfully at the gate  and waited   some time  at length we were admitted  and they took me to a kind   of lobby  where we stayed  while one of the posse went to advise         TEE FOOL OF QUALITY  381     the justiciary of my attendance  At length he returned  and    accosting me in a tone of surly and discouraging authority Friend    says he  my lord is engaged  and not at leisure to night   to morrow    perhaps  he may hear what you have to plead in your own defence    So saying  he and his fellows thrust me into a waste room  and   locked and chained the door upon me  and  laughing  bid me to   warm or cool my heels at pleasure      Fool  fool that I was   said I  to quit the side of my brave and   faithful companions   how quickly should we have discomfited this   magistrate and all his host
