I saw that the eyes of every one were upon her  I was willing to hear what she had to say for herself  Poor girl  She will suffer  I doubt  for her speciousness  Yet I cannot say  all things considered  that she was very malapert  That quality is yet to come  She is young        I therefore trifled a little with her  And went farther than I generally choose to go with the reading species of women  in order to divert an inundation of nonsense and foppery  breaking in from one of the company  Sir Hargrave Pollexfen  Of whom more anon  You know  Marforio  that a man  when he is provok d to fight with an overgrown boy  hath every body against him  So hath a scholar who engageth on learned topics with a woman  The Sex must be flatter d at the expence of truth  Many things are thought to be pretty from the mouth of a woman  which would be egregiously weak and silly proceeding from that of a man  His very eminence in learning  on such a contention  would tend only to exalt her  and depreciate himself  As the girl was every body s favourite  and as the Baronet seemed to eye her with particular regard  I spared her  A man would not  you know  spoil a girl s fortune       95 But how shall I be able to tell you what I imagine Sir Hargrave would have written  Can I do it  if I place him in the light of a Lover  and not either under do his character as such  or incur the censure of vanity and conceit   Well  but are you sure  Harriet  methinks my uncle asks  that the Baronet is really and truly so egregiously smitten with you  as he pretended he was   Why  ay  That s the thing  Sir   You girls are so apt to take in earnest the compliments made you by men   And so we are  But our credulity  my dear Sir  is a greater proof of our innocence  than mens professions are of their sincerity  So  let losers speak  and winners laugh   But let him be in jest  if he will  In jest or in earnest  Sir Hargrave must be extravagant  I ween  in love speeches  And that I may not be thought wholly to decline this part of my task  I will suppose him professing with Hudibras  after he has praised me beyond measure  for graces of his own creation   The sun shall now no more dispense  His own  but Harriet s influence   Where e er she treads  her feet shall set  The primrose  and the violet   All spices  perfumes  and sweet powders   Shall borrow from her breath their odours   Worlds shall depend upon her eye   And when she frowns upon them  die   And what if I make him address me  by way of apostrophe  shall I say   writing to his friend  in the following strain   My faith  my friend  is adamantine   As chains of destiny  I ll maintain   True  as Apollo ever spoke   Or oracle from heart of oak     96 Then shine upon me but benignly   With that one  and that other pigsnye   The sun and day shall sooner part   Than love or you shake off my heart   Well  but what  my Harriet  would honest Mr  Singleton have written  methinks you ask  had he written about you   Why thus  perhaps  my Lucy  And to his grandmother  for she is living      We had rare fun  at dinner  and after dinner my grandmother  There was one Miss Barnevelt  a fine tall portly young Lady  There was Miss Clements  not handsome  but very learned  and who  as was easy to perceive  could hold a good argument  on occasion  There was Miss Cantillon  as pretty a young Lady as one should wish to behold in a summer s day  And there was one Miss Byron  a Northamptonshire Lady  whom I never saw before in my born days  There was Mr  Walden  a famous scholar  I thought him very entertaining  for he talk d of learning  and such like things  which I know not so much of as I wish I did  because my want of knowing a little Latin and Greek has made my understanding look less than other mens  O my grandmother  what a wise man would the being able to talk Latin and Greek have made me —And yet I thought that nowand then Mr  Walden made too great a fuss about his  But there was a rich and noble Baronet  richer than me  as they say  a great deal  Sir Hargrove Pollexfun  if I spell his name right  A charming man  and charmingly dress d  And so many fine things he said  and was so merry  and so facetious  that he did nothing but laugh  as a man may say  And I was as merry as him
