little more for   the conclusion of his marriage with her than the arrival of her two   brothers  she had often told him  whenever he pressed her on that score    that she would give no definitive answer  till she had received the   advice and approbation of the elder Mr  Thoughtless       That gentleman was now expected in a few days  and Mr  Francis   Thoughtless having intelligence of his being on his return  was also   preparing to leave L    e  in order to meet him on his first arrival in   London  but  during this short space of time  some events fell out    which put a great damp on the gaiety of those  who had with so much   impatience wished for their approach       Mr  Trueworth had an aunt  who  besides being the nearest relation he   had living  and the only one in London  was extremely respected by him    on account of her great prudence  exemplary virtue  and the tender   affection she had always testified for him  This good lady thought   herself bound by duty  as she was led by love  to make a thorough   enquiry into the character of the young person her nephew was about to   marry  she was acquainted with many who had been in company with Miss   Betsy  and were witnesses of her behaviour  she asked the opinion of   those among them  whom she looked upon as the most candid  concerning   the match now on the carpet  and was extremely troubled to find their   answers were no way conformable to the idea Mr  Trueworth had   endeavoured to inspire her with of his mistress s perfections  they all    indeed  agreed that she was handsome  well shaped  genteel  had a good   deal of wit  vivacity  and good humour  but shook their heads when any   of those requisites to make the married state agreeable were mentioned       Poor Miss Betsy  as the reader has had but too much opportunities to   observe  was far from setting forth to any advantage the real good   qualities she was possessed of  on the contrary  the levity of her   conduct rather disfigured the native innocence of her mind  and the   purity of her intentions  so that  according to the poet             All saw her spots  but few her brightness took        The old lady not being able to hear any thing concerning her intended   niece  but what was greatly to her dissatisfaction  was continually   remonstrating to Mr  Trueworth  that the want of solidity in a wife was   one of the worst misfortunes that could attend a marriage state  that   the external beauties of the person could not atone for the internal   defects of the mind  that a too great gaiety  du coeur   frequently   led women into errors without their designing to be guilty of them  and   conjured him to consider well before the irrevocable words   I take you   for better and for worse   were passed  how ill it would suit  either   with his honour  or his peace of mind  if she whom he now wished to make   his partner for life should  after she became so  behave in the same   manner she did now       Mr  Trueworth listened to what she said  with all the attention she   could desire  but was too passionately in love to be much influenced by   it  not that he did not see there were some mistakes in the conduct of   Miss Betsy  which he could wish reformed  yet he could not look upon   them as so dangerous to her virtue and reputation  and therefore omitted   no arguments  which he thought might justify his choice  and clear the   accused fair one from all blame  in the eyes of a person whose   approbation he was very desirous of obtaining       The warmth with which he spoke  convinced his aunt  that to oppose his   inclinations in this point was only warring with the winds  she desisted   from speaking any more against the marriage  and contented herself with   telling him  that since he was bent on making Miss Betsy his wife  she   should be glad if  at least  he would remove her into the country  and   prevent her returning to this town as long as possible       This last council had a great deal of weight with Mr  Trueworth  he had   often wished in his heart  when seeing her  as he often did    encompassed with a crowd of such whom his good understanding made him   despise  that if ever he became her husband  it might be in his power to   prevail on her
