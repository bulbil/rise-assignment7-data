ready to go  yet  upon the industry  and the valour of these alone  every kingdom must hope for security  Not the effeminate  and the luxurious  can defend their country in the day of battle  they may increase timidity by their example  but opulence can never give true relief  The Spaniards and the Portuguese were much more powerful before they divided their strength into all the torrid climates of Southern America  The state thus got riches  but lost men  they had gold  but could not regain industry  Thus are their nations now incapable of defending themselves against powerful foreign invasion  The immense wealth of the Indies that every year comes home to their ports goes to inrich a few  their subjects are either in the extremes of wealth or poverty  the rich have only slaves beneath them  who hate those for whom they must labour  the poor have no acquisitions  nor property  to defend  so that their armies are composed either of wretches pressed into the service  who only seek for opportunities not to fight  but to fly  or of men  rich and noble  courageous from pride  yet weak from luxury  Such is not  as yet  the case of England  nor will ever be  if a passion for conquest is not mistaken for national prosperity   I am   c     243  LETTER XXIX   THE success of our arms in America was atchieved by moderate efforts  on the contrary  in Europe the efforts we made  and the operations of our great ally the King of Prussia  were astonishing  yet produced no very signal effects  Safety was all that could be expected  and this was secured contrary to all human expectation  You have just seen that Monarch surrounded by enemies  the greatest and most formidable powers of Europe  you have seen almost the whole power of the continent united against  and hovering over  his devoted dominions  and the only allies that remained to him bound by treaty to retire  and give him no assistance  In this terrible situation he still adhered to his fortitude  and  relying on his natural subjects alone  resolved never to abandon his claims  Such was the desperate condition of his affairs  yet they were still rendered more hopeless  when he was informed that his only friend  the Monarch of that generous people which had hitherto supplied him with money and stores  was going to forsake him  and leave him to irremediable ruin  It was thus he expostulated with the doubting Monarch upon this occasion    Is it possible that your Majesty can have so little fortitude and constancy  as to be dispirited by a small reverse of fortune  Are our affairs so ruinous that they cannot be repaired  Consider the step you have made me undertake  and remember that you are the cause of all my misfortunes  I should never have abandoned my former alliances but for your flattering assurances  I do not now repent of the treaty concluded between us  but I intreat you will not ingloriously leave me at the mercy of my enemies  after having brought upon me all the powers of Europe   The French and Imperialists  after a successful summer campaign  were  at this time  which was the depth of winter  sat down to the siege of Leipsic  His Prussian Majesty dreaded the capture of this important   244 city  and soon  unexpectedly  seemed to rise up before it  Such was the terror of his arms  even vanquished as he had been  that his approach raised the siege  and the French  though superior in number  retreated  He  at length  overtook them at a village called Rosbach  and gained so complete a victory  that night alone saved their whole army from destruction  The Austrians were  in another part of the Empire  still victorious  and had taken the Prince of Bevern  his generalissimo  prisoner  The King  after a dreadful march of two hundred miles  in the depth of winter  came up with them near Breslau  disposed his inferior forces with his usual judgment  and obtained another bloody victory  in which he took not less than fifteen thousand prisoners  Breslau  with a garrison of ten thousand men  surrendered soon after  These successes dispirited the enemy  and raised his allies to new hopes     After the capitulation of Closter Severn was signed  between the Duke of Cumberland and the Duke of Richelieu  both sides began to complain of infractions  The Hanoverians accused the rapacity of the French General  and the insolent brutality of his soldiers  while the French retorted the charge of insurrection against them  and began to think of treating as a conquered enemy those whom they had only bound by treaty as neutrals  Treaties have never been preserved longer than interest or compulsion bound them  political faith is a word without meaning  the French oppressed the Hanoverians  the latter resumed their arms  and each side complained  as usual  of infraction  A General was not long wanting to assemble the collecting army  Prince Ferdinand of Brunswic put himself at their head  began by skirmishing with success  and  at last  were in a capacity of becoming formidable to their late victors  From this time the King of Prussia sought
