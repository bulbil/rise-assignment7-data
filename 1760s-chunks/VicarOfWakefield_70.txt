 when Mr  Jenkinson entering  informed me that there was news of my daughter  for that she was seen by a person about two hours before in a strange gentleman s company  and that they had stopt at a neighbouring village for refreshment  and seemed as if returning to town  He had scarce delivered this news  when the gaoler came with looks of haste and pleasure  to inform me  that my daughter was found  Moses came running in a moment after  crying out that his sister Sophy was below and coming up with our old friend Mr  Burchell     Just as he delivered this news my dearest girl entered  and with looks almost wild with pleasure  ran to kiss me in a transport of affection  Her mother s tears and silence also shewed her pleasure —     Here  pappa    Page  165  cried the charming girl    here is the brave man to whom I owe my delivery  to this gentleman s intrepidity I am indebted for my happiness and safety—   A kiss from Mr  Burchell  whose pleasure seemed even greater than hers  interrupted what she was going to add    Ah  Mr  Burchell    cried I    this is but a wretched habitation you now find us in  and we are now very different from what you last saw us  You were ever our friend  we have long discovered our errors with regard to you  and repented of our ingratitude  After the vile usage you then received at my hands  I am almost ashamed to behold your face  yet I hope you ll forgive me  as I was deceived by a base ungenerous wretch  who  under the mask of friendship  has undone me     It is impossible    replied Mr  Burchell    that I should forgive you  as you never  Page  166  deserved my resentment  I partly saw your delusion then  and as it was out of my power to restrain  I could only pity it     It was ever my conjecture    cried I    that your mind was noble  but now I find it so  But tell me  my dear child  how hast thou been relieved  or who the ruffians were who carried thee away     Indeed  Sir    replied she    as to the villain who brought me off  I am yet ignor ut  For as my mamma and I were walking out  he came behind us  and almost before I could call for help  forced me into the post chaise  and in an instant the horses drove away  I met several on the road  to whom I cried out for assistance  but they disregarded my entreaties  In the mean time the ruffian himself used every art to hinder me from crying out  he flattered and threatened  Page  167  by turns  and swore that if I continued but silent  he intended no harm  In the mean time I had broken the canvas that he had drawn up  and whom should I perceive at some distance but your old friend Mr  Burchell  walking along with his usual swiftness  with the great stick for which we used so much to ridicule him  As soon as we came within hearing  I called out to him by name  and entreated his help  I repeated my exclamations several times  upon which  with a very loud voice  he bid the postillion stop  but the boy took no notice  but drove on with still greater speed  I now thought he could never overtake us  when in less than a minute I saw Mr  Burchell come running up by the side of the horses  and with one blow knock the postillion to the ground  The horses when he was fallen soon stopt of themselves  and the ruffian stepping out  with oaths and menaces drew his sword  and  Page  168  ordered him at his peril to retire  but Mr  Burchell running up  shivered his sword to pieces  and then pursued him for near a quarter of a mile  but he made his escape  I was at this time come out myself  willing to assist my deliverer  but he soon returned to me in triumph  The postillion  who was recovered  was going to make his escape too  but Mr  Burchell ordered him at his peril to mount again  and drive back to town  Finding it impossible to resist  he reluctantly complied  though the wound he had received seemed  to me at least  to be dangerous  He continued to complain of the pain as we drove along  so that he at last excited Mr  Burchell s compassion  who  at my request  exchanged him for another at an inn where we called on our return     Welcome then    cried I    my child  and thou her gallant deliverer  a thousand  Page  169  welcomes  Though our chear is but wretched  yet our hearts are ready to receive you  And now  Mr  Burchell  as you have delivered my girl  if you think her a recompence she
