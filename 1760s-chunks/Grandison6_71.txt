 for taking pity of you in time  Were you Four or Five and twenty when he honoured you with his hand at St  George s church   and yet to treat him as you do  in more places than one  in this very Letter   But I will tell you what I will do with this same strange Letter—I will transcribe all the good things in it  There are many which both delight and instruct  and some morning  before I dress for the day  I will  Sad task  Charlotte  But it shall be by way of penance for some of my faults and sollies   transcribe the intolerable passages  so make two Letters of it  One I will keep to shew my friends here  in order to increase  if it be possible  their admiration of my Charlotte  the bad one I will present to you  I know I shall transcribe it in a violent hurry—Not much matter whether it be legible  or not—The hobbling it will cause in the reading  will make it appear   176 worse to you  than if you could read it as glibly as you write  If half of it be illegible  enough will be lest to make you blush for the whole  and wonder what sort of a pen it was that somebody  unknown to you  put into your standish   After all  spare me not  my ever dear  my evercharming friend  spare only your self  Don t let Charlotte run away from both G s  You will then be always equally sure of my admiration and love  For dearly do I love you  with all your faults  so dearly  that when I consider your faults by themselves  I am ready to arraign my heart  and to think there is more of the roguery of my Charlotte in it than I will allow of   One punishment to you  I intend  my dear—In all my future Letters  I will write as if I had never seen this your naughty one  Indeed I am in a kind of way  faulty or not  that I cannot get out of  all at once  but as soon as I can  I will  that I may better justify my displeasure at some parts of your Letter  by the observance I will pay to others  That is a sweet sentence of my Charlotte s     Change your name  and increase your consequence    Reflect  my dear—How naughty must you have been  that such a charming instance of goodness could not bribe to spare you    Your ever affectionate and grateful HARRIET BYRON   LETTER XXIX  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   Selby house  Tuesday Morning  Oct  24   MR  Deane would not go back with us  He laid a strict charge upon me  at parting  not to be punctilious   I am not  my dear Lady G  Do you think I am  The men are their own enemies  if they wish us to   177 be open hearted and sincere  and are not so themselves  Let them enable us to depend on their candour  as much as we may on that of Sir Charles Grandison  and the women will be inexcusable  who shall play either the prude or coquet with them  You will say  I am very cunning  perhaps  to form at the same time a rule from  and an excuse for  my own conduct to this excellent man  But be that as it will  it is truth   We sent our duty last night to Shirley manor  and expect every moment the dear parent there with us   She is come  I will go down  and if I get her by myself  or only with my aunt and Lucy  I will tell her a thousand thousand agreeable things  which have passed since last I had her tender blessing   WE have had this Greville and this Fenwick here  I could very well have spared them  Miss Orme came hither also  uninvited  to breakfast  a favour she often does us  I knew not at first how to behave to Sir Charles before her  She looked so jealous of him  so cold  Under her bent brow she looked at him  Yes  and No  were all her answers  with an air so stiff —But this reserve lasted not above a quarter of an hour  Sir Charles addressed himself to me  with so much respect  to her  with so polite a freedom  that she could not hold her shyness   Her brow cleared up  her eyes looked larger  and more free  Her buttoned up pretty mouth opened to a smile  She answered  she asked  questions  gave her required opinion on more topics than one  and was again all Miss Orme   Every body took great notice of Sir Charles s fine address to her  and were charmed with him  for we all esteem Mr  Orme  and love his sister  How pleasant it was to see the sunshine break out in her amiable countenance  and the gloom vanishing  by degrees     178 She took me out into the lesser parlour—What a strange variable creature am I  said she  How I hated this
