have  to write again  before I embrace you all  my dear  my everdear and indulgent friends   I will only say  that Miss Williams is a genteel girl  but will hardly be more than one of the better sort of modern women of condition  and that she is to be classed so high  will be owing more to Miss Clements s lesson s  than  I am afraid  to her mother s example   Is it  Lucy  that I have more experience and discernment now  or less charity and good nature  than when I first came town  for then I thought well  in the main  of Lady Betty Williams  But tho  she is a good natur d  obliging woman  she is so immersed in the love of public diversions  so fond of routs  drums  hurricanes—Bless me  my dear  how learned should I have been in all the gaieties of the modern life  what a fine Lady  possibly  had I not been carried into more rational  however to me they have been more painful  scenes  and had I followed the lead of this Lady  as she  kindly  as to her intention  had designed I should   In the afternoon Mr  Beauchamp is to introduce Sir Harry and Lady Beauchamp  on their first visit to the two sisters   I had almost forgot to tell you  that my cousins and   218 I are to attend the good Countess of D  for one half hour  after we have taken leave of Lady Olivia and her aunt   And now  my Lucy  do I shut up my correspondence with you from London  My heart beats high with the hope of being as indulgently received by all you  my dearest friends  as I used to be after a shorter absence  For I am  and ever will be   The grateful  dutiful  and affectionate HARRIET BYRON   LETTER XXXII  Miss BYRON  To Lady G   Selby house  Monday April 24   THO  the kind friends with whom I parted at Dunstable were pleased  one and all  to allow  that the correspondence which is to pass between my dear Lady G  and their Harriet  should answer the just expectations of each upon her  in the writing way  and tho   at your motion  remember  not at mine  they promised to be contented with hearing read to them such parts of my Letters as you should think proper to communicate  yet cannot I dispense with my duty to Lady L  my Emily  my cousin Reeves  and Dr  Bartlett  Accordingly I write to them by this post  and I charge you  my dear  with my sincere and thankful compliments to your Lord  and to Mr  Beauchamp  for their favours   What an agreeable night  in the main  was Friday night  Had we not been to separate next morning  it would have been an agreeable one indeed   Is not my aunt Selby an excellent woman  But you all admired her  She admires you all  I will tell you another time  what she said of you  my dear  in particular   My cousin Lucy  too—is she not an amiable creature    219 —Indeed you all were delighted with her  But I take pleasure in recollecting your approbations of one I so dearly love  She is as prudent as Lady L  and  now our Nancy is so well recovered  as chearful as Lady G  You said  you would provide a good husband for her  Don t forget  The man  whoever he be  cannot be too good for my Lucy  Nancy is such another good girl  But so I told you   Well  and pray  Did you ever meet with so pleasant a man as my uncle Selby  What should we have done  when we talked of your brother  when we talked of our parting  had it not been for him  You looked upon me every now and then  when he returned your smartness upon him  as if you thought I had let him know some of your perversnesses to Lord G —And do you think I did not  Indeed I did  Can you imagine that your frank hearted Harriet  who hides not from her friends her own faults  should conceal yours —But what a particular character is yours  Every body blames you  that knows of your overlivelinesses  yet every body loves you—I think  for your very faults  Had it not been so  do you imagine I could ever have loved you  after you had led Lady L  to join with you  on a certain teazing occasion —My uncle dotes upon you   But don t tell Emily that my cousin James Selby is in Love with her  That he may not  on the score of the dear girl s fortune  be thought presumptuous  let me tell you  that he is almost of age  and  when he is  comes into possession of an handsome estate  He has many good qualities  I have  in short  a very great value for him  but not enough  tho  he is my relation  to wish him my still more beloved Emily
