the preceding night  These  penitential reflections were attended with many laudable resolutions of  profiting by the experience which he had so dearly purchased  but he  was one of those philosophers who always put off till another day the  commencement of their reformation   CHAPTER LXXXVI   Peregrine receives a letter from Hatchway  in consequence of which he  repairs to the Garrison  and performs the last Offices to his Aunt  He  is visited by Mr  Gauntlet  who invites him to his Marriage   In this circle of amusements our hero s time was parcelled out  and  few young gentlemen of the age enjoyed life with greater relish   notwithstanding those intervening checks of reason  which served only  to whet his appetite for a repetition of the pleasures she so prudently  condemned  when he received the following letter  by which he was  determined to visit his estate in the country        Cousin Pickle   I hope you are in a better trim than your       aunt  who hath been fast moored to her bed these seven weeks        by several feet of under water lodging in her hold and       hollop  whereby I doubt her planks are rotted  so that she       cannot choose but fall to pieces in a short time  I have       done all in my power to keep her tight and easy  and free       from sudden squalls that might overstrain her  And here       have been the doctors  who have scuttled her lower deck  and       let out six gallons of water  For my own part  I wonder how       the devil it came there  for you know as how it was a liquor       she never took in  But as for those fellows the doctors  they       are like unskilful carpenters  that in mending one leak make       a couple  and so she fills again apace  But the worst sign of       all is this here  she won t let a drop of Nantz go between       the combings of her teeth  and has quite lost the rudder of       her understanding  whereby she yaws woundily in her speech       palavering about some foreign part called the New Geereusalem        and wishing herself in a safe berth in the river Geordun        The parson  I must say  strives to keep her steady  concerning       the navigation of her soul  and talks very sensibly of charity       and the poor  whereof she hath left a legacy of two hundred       pounds in her will  And here has been Mr  Gamaliel and your       brother my lord  demanding entrance at the gate  in order to       see her  but I would not suffer them to come aboard  and       pointed my patereroes  which made them sheer off  Your sister        Mrs  Clover  keeps close watch upon her kinswoman  without       ever turning in  and a kind hearted young woman it is  I       should be glad to see you at the garrison  if the wind of your       inclination sits that way  and mayhap it may be a comfort to       your aunt  to behold you alongside of her  when her anchor is       apeak  So no more at present  but rests your friend and humble       servant to command                          John Hatchway      6 22 15  3 45 PM   Next morning  after the receipt of this epistle  Peregrine  in order to  manifest his regard to his aunt  as well as his friendship for honest  Jack  set out on horseback for their habitation  attended by Pipes  who  longed to see his old messmate  but before he had reached the garrison   Mrs  Hatchway had given up the ghost  in the threescore and fifth year  of her age  The widower seemed to bear his loss with resignation  and  behaved very decently upon the occasion  though he did not undergo those  dangerous transports of sorrow  which some tender hearted husbands have  felt at the departure of their wives  The lieutenant was naturally a  philosopher  and so well disposed to acquiesce in the dispensations of  Providence  that in this  as well as in every other emergency of his  life  he firmly believed  that everything which happened was for the  best   Peregrine s
