 quality  and where she lived  her invention would   supply her with the means of making a more particular discovery  She   resolved  therefore  on going again to the shop  under the pretence of   buying something  and asking the mercer himself  who she could not   imagine would have any interest in concealing what she desired to know       Some company coming in  prevented her from going that afternoon  but she   went the next morning after breakfast  The mercer not happening to be at   home  she was more than once tempted by her impatience to ask for his   wife  and as often restrained by the reflection that such a thing might   be looked upon as a piece of impertinence in a person so much a   stranger  she therefore left the house without speaking to any body but   the man she had seen the day before       Her curiosity  however  would not  perhaps  have suffered her to stop   here  if something of more moment had not fallen out to engage her   attention  and put the other out of her head for the present       The nobleman on whom Mr  Munden depended for the gift so often mentioned   in this history  had been a long time out of town  and was but lately   returned  He had heard in the country that Mr  Munden was married  and   that his wife was very beautiful and accomplished       On Mr  Munden s going to pay his compliments to him on his arrival   I   congratulate you   said he   I am told you are married  and have got one   of the prettiest and most amiable women in London for a wife         As to beauty  my lord   replied he   there is no certain standard for   it  and I am entirely of the poet s mind  that              Tis in no face  but in the lover s eye         But whatever she is   continued he   I am afraid she would be too vain   if she knew the honour your lordship does her  in making this favourable   mention of her         Not at all   rejoined the peer   but I shall not take her character   from common fame  you must give me leave to be a judge of the   perfections I have heard so much talk of  besides   pursued he   I have   a mind to see what sort of a house you keep  I think I will come some   day  and take a dinner with you        It is not to be doubted but that Mr  Munden omitted nothing that might   assure his lordship  that it was an honour which he was extremely   ambitious of  and should be equally proud of receiving  though he durst   not have presumed to have asked it       The very next day being appointed for this grand visit  he went home to   his wife  transported with the gracious behaviour of his patron towards   him  He threw a large parcel of guineas into her lap  and charged her to   spare nothing that might entertain their noble guest in a manner   befitting his high rank  and the favours he expected one day to receive   from him       Mr  Munden could not have given any commands that would be more pleasing   to his fair wife  feasting and grand company were her delight  She set   about making the necessary preparations with the greatest alacrity   imaginable  and it must be acknowledged that  considering the shortness   of the time  she had sufficient to have employed the most able and   experienced housewife                CHAPTER XII       Is only the prelude to greater matters          It might be justly reckoned a piece of impertinence to take up the   reader s time with a repetition of the bill of fare of the entertainment   made on the above occasion  it will be sufficient to say that every   thing was extremely elegant  that it was composed of the best chosen   dishes  which were all served up in the greatest order  and that there   was as great a variety of them as consisted with the table of a private   gentleman  without incurring the censure of profuseness       Such as it was  however  the noble lord seemed highly delighted with it    he praised every thing that came before him  almost to a degree of   flattery  and took all opportunities of being yet more lavish in his   encomiums on the beauty  wit
