crisis  madam  is at hand  And I had not intended to open my lips upon the subject till it was over  except to Dr  Bartlett  who knows the whole   169 affair  and indeed every affair of my life  But  as I hinted before  my heart is opened by the frankness of yours  If you will be sogood as to indulge me  I will briefly lay before you a few of the difficulties of my situation  and leave it to you to communicate or not  at your pleasure  what I shall relate to my two sisters and Lord L  You four seem to be animated by one soul   I am extremely concerned  Sir—I am very much concerned—repeated the trembling simpl•ton  one cheek feeling to myself very cold  the other glowingly warm  by turns  and now pale  now crimson perhaps to the eye  that any thing should make you unhappy  But  Sir  I shall think myself favoured by your confidence   I am interrupted in my recital of his affecting narration  Don t be impatient  Lucy  I almost wi•h I had not myself heard it   LETTER XX  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   I DO not intend  madam  to trouble you with an history of all that part of my life which I was obliged to pass abroad from about the Seventeenth to near the Twenty fifth year of my age  tho  perhaps it has been as busy a period as could well be  in the life of a man so young  and who never sought to trea• in oblique or crooked paths  After this en•rance into it  Dr  Bartlett shall be at liberty to satisfy your curiosity in a more particular manner  for he and I have corresponded for years with an intim cy that has few examples between a youth and a man in advanced life  And here let me own the advantage▪ I have received from his condescension  for I found the following questions often occur to me  and to be of the highest service in the conduct of my life—   What   170 account shall I give of this to Dr  Bartlett     How  were I to give way to this temptation  shall I report it to Dr  Bartlett  —Or   Shall I be an hypocrite  and only inform him of the best  and meanly conceal from him the worst      Thus  madam  was Dr  Bartlett in the place of a second conscience to me  And many a good thing did I do  many a bad one avoid  for having set up such a monitor over my conduct  And it was the more necessary that I should  as I am naturally passionate  proud  ambitious  and as I had the honour of being early distinguished  Pardon  madam  the seeming vanity  by a sex  of which no man was ever a greater admirer  and  possibly  the more distinguished  as  for my safety sake  I was as studious to decline intimacy with the gay ones of it  however dignified by rank  or celebrated for beauty  as most young men are to cultivate their favour   Nor is it so much to be wondered at  that I had advantages which every one who travels  has not  Residing for some time at the principal courts  and often visiting the same places  in the length of time I was abroad  I was considered  in a manner  as a native  at the same time  that I was treated with the respect that is generally paid to travellers of figure  as well in France  as Italy  I was very genteelly supported  I stood in high credit with my countrymen  to whom I had many ways of being serviceable  They made known to every body my father s affection for me  his magnificent spirit  the antient families  on both sides  from which I was descended  I kept the best company  avoided intrigues  made not myself obnoxious to serious or pious people  tho  I scrupled not to avow  when called upon  my own principles  From all these advantages  I was respected beyond my degree   I should not  madam  have been thus lavish in my own praise  but to account to you for the favour I   171 stood in with several families of the first rank  and to suggest an excuse for more than one of them  which thought it no disgrace to wish me to be allied with them   Lord L  mentioned to you  madam  and my sisters  a Florentine Lady  by the name of OLIVIA  She is  indeed  a woman of high qualities  nobly born  gonerous  amiable in her features  genteel in her person  and mistress of a great fortune in possession  which is entirely at her own disposal  having not father  mother  brother  or other near relations  The first time I saw her was at the opera  An opportunity offered in her sight  where a Lady  insulted by a Lover made desperate by her just refusal of him  claimed and received my protection  What I did  on the occasion  was generally applauded  Olivia  in particular
