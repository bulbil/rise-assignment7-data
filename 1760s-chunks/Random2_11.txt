her study at leisure  to which I was strongly prompted by my curiosity —Here I found a thousand scraps of her own poetry  consisting of three  four  ten  twelve and twenty lines  on an infinity of subjects  which  as whim inspired  she had begun  without constancy or capacity to bring to any degree of composition  But what was very extraordinary in a female poet  there was not the least mention made of love in any of her performances —I counted fragments of five tragedies  the titles of which were     The stern Philosopher —The double Murder —The sacrilegious   24 Traitor —The fall of Lucifer —And the Last Day    From whence I gathered  that her disposition was gloomy  and her imagination delighted with objects of horror —Her library was composed of the best English historians  poets  and philosophers  of all the French criticks and poets  and of a few books in Italian  chiefly poetry  at the head of which were Tasso and Ariosto  pretty much used —Besides these  translations of the classicks into French  but not one book in Greek or Latin  a circumstance that discovered her ignorance of these languages —After having taken a full view of this collection  I retired  and at the usual time was preparing to lay the cloth  when I was told by the maid that her mistress was still in bed  and had been so affected with the notes of the hounds in the morning  that she actually believed herself a hare beset with the hunters  and begged a few greens to munch for her breakfast —When I testified my surprize at this unaccountable imagination  she let me know that her lady was very much subject to whims of this nature  sometimes fancying herself an animal  sometimes a piece of furniture  during which conceited transformations  it was very dangerous to come near her  especially when she represented a beast  for that lately  in the character of a cat  she had flown at her and scratched her face in a terrible manner —that some months ago  she prophesied the general conflagration was at hand  and nothing would be able to quench it  but her water  which therefore she kept so long that her life was in danger  and she must needs have died of the retention  had they not found an expedient to make her evacuate by kindling a   25 bonfire under her chamber window  and persuading her that the house was in flames  upon which  with great deliberation  she bid them bring all the tubs and vessels they could find  to be filled  for the preservation of the house  into one of which she immediately discharged the cause of her distemper —I was also informed  that nothing contributed so much to the recovery of her reason  as musick  which was always administred on these occasions by Narcissa  who play d perfectly well on the harpsicord  and to whom she  the maid  was just then going to intimate her aunt s disorder —She was no sooner gone  than I was summoned by the bell to my lady s chamber  where I found her sitting squat on her hams  on the floor  in the manner of puss when she listens to the cries of her pursuers —When I appeared  she started up with an alarmed look  and sprung to the other side of the room to avoid me  whom  without doubt  she mistook for a beagle thirsting after her life —Perceiving her extreme confusion  I retired  and on the stair case met the adorable Narcissa coming up  to whom I imparted the situation of my mistress  She said not a word  but smiling with unspeakable grace  went into her aunt s apartment  and in a little time my ears were ravished with the effects of her skill —She accompanied the instrument with a voice so sweet and melodious  that I did not wonder at the surprizing change it produced on the spirits of my mistress  which were soon composed to peace and sober reflection     About seven o clock the hunters arrived  with the skins of two foxes and one badger  carried before them as trophies of their success  and   26 when they were about to sit down to dinner  or supper  Sir Timothy Thicket desired that Narcissa would honour the table with her presence  But this  notwithstanding her brother s threats and intreaties  she refused  on pretence of attending her aunt  who was indisposed  so that I enjoyed the satisfaction of seeing my rival mortified  But this disappointment made no great impression on him  who consoled himself with the bottle  of which the whole company became so enamoured  that after a most horrid uproar of laughing  singing  swearing  dancing  and fighting  they were all carried to bed in a state of utter oblivion —My duty being altogether detached from the  Squire and his family  I led a pretty easy and comfortable life  drinking daily intoxicating draughts of love from the charms of Narcissa  which brightened on my contemplation  every day  more and more —Inglorious as my station was  I became blind to my own unworthiness  and even conceived hopes of one day enjoying this amiable creature  whose affability greatly encouraged these presumptuous thoughts     27  CHAP  XL    She is surprized
