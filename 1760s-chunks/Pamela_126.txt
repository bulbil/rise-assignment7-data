s good   lessons and examples  and choose the evil  and so  in a moment s time    become the vilest of creatures  And all this  for what  I pray  Why    truly  for a pair of diamond ear rings  a necklace  and a diamond ring   for my finger  which would not become me  For a few paltry fine   clothes  which  when I wore them  would make but my former poverty more   ridiculous to every body that saw me  especially when they knew the base   terms I wore them upon  But  indeed  I was to have a great parcel of   guineas beside  I forget how many  for  had there been ten times more    they would have been not so much to me  as the honest six guineas you   tricked me out of  Mrs  Jewkes       Well  forsooth  but then I was to have I know not how many pounds a year   for my life  and my poor father  there was the jest of it   was to be   the manager for the abandoned prostitute his daughter  And then   there   was the jest again   my kind  forgiving  virtuous master  would pardon   me all my misdeeds       Yes  thank him for nothing  truly  And what  pray  are all these violent   misdeeds   Why  they are for daring to adhere to the good lessons that   were taught me  and not learning a new one  that would have reversed all   my former  For not being contented when I was run away with  in order to   be ruined  but contriving  if my poor wits had been able  to get out of   danger  and preserve myself honest       Then was he once jealous of poor John  though he knew John was his own   creature  and helped to deceive me       Then was he outrageous against poor Parson Williams  and him has this   good  merciful master  thrown into gaol  and for what  Why  truly  for   that  being a divine  and a good man  he had the fear of God before his   eyes  and was willing to forego all his expectations of interest  and   assist an oppressed poor creature       But  to be sure  I must be forward  bold  saucy  and what not  to dare   to run away from certain ruin  and to strive to escape from an unjust   confinement  and I must be married to the parson  nothing so sure       He would have had but a poor catch of me  had I consented  But he  and   you too  know I did not want to marry any body  I only wanted to go to   my poor parents  and to have my own liberty  and not to be confined by   such an unlawful restraint  and which would not have been inflicted upon   me  but only that I am a poor  destitute  young body  and have no friend   that is able to right me       So  Mrs  Jewkes  said I  here is my history in brief  And I am a very   unhappy young creature  to be sure   And why am I so   Why  because my   master sees something in my person that takes his present fancy  and   because I would not be undone   Why  therefore to choose  I must  and I   shall be undone   And this is all the reason that can be given       She heard me run on all this time  while I was undressing  without any   interruption  and I said  Well  I must go to the two closets  ever since   an affair of the closet at the other house  though he is so far off  And   I have a good mind to wake this poor maid  No  don t  said she  I charge   you  I am very angry with her  and she ll get no harm there  and if she   wakes  she may come to bed well enough  as long as there is a candle in   the chimney       So I looked into the closet  and kneeled down in my own  as I used to   do  to say my prayers  and this with my underclothes in my hand  all   undressed  and passed by the poor sleeping wench  as I thought  in my   return  But  oh  little did I think it was my wicked  wicked master  in   a gown and petticoat of hers  and her apron over his face and shoulders    What meanness will not Lucifer make his votaries stoop to
