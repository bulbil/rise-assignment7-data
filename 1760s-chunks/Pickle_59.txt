of the  community whose maxims and practices he had disclosed  for he was  considered as a spy  who had intruded himself into their society  with a  view of betraying it  or  at best  as an apostate and renegado from the  faith and principles which he had professed   CHAPTER XXII     6 22 15  3 45 PM   He is insulted by his Tutor  whom he lampoons  Makes a considerable  Progress in Polite Literature  and  in an Excursion to Windsor  meets  with Emilia by accident  and is very coldly received   Among those who suffered by his craft and infidelity was Mr  Jumble   his own tutor  who could not at all digest the mortifying affront he had  received  and was resolved to be revenged on the insulting author  With  this view he watched the conduct of Mr  Pickle with the utmost rancour  of vigilance  and let slip no opportunity of treating him disrespect   which he knew the disposition of his pupil could less brook than any  other severity it was in his power to exercise   Peregrine had been several mornings absent from chapel  and as Mr   Jumble never failed to question him in a very peremptory style about his  non attendance  he invented some very plausible excuses  but at length  his ingenuity was exhausted  he received a very galling rebuke for his  proffigacy of morals  and  that he might feel it the more sensibly  was  ordered  by way of exercise  to compose a paraphrase in English verse  upon these two lines in Virgil         Vane Ligur  frustraque animis elate superbis       Nequicquam patrias tentasti lubricus artes   The imposition of this invidious theme had all the desired effect upon  Peregrine  who not only considered it as a piece of unmannerly abuse  leveled against his own conduct  but also a retrospective insult on  the memory of his grandfather  who  as he had been informed  was in his  lifetime more noted for his cunning than candour in trade   Exasperated at this instance of the pedant s audacity  he had well nigh   in his first transports  taken corporal satisfaction on the spot   but  foreseeing the troublesome consequences that would attend such  a flagrant outrage against the laws of the university  he checked his  indignation  and resolved to revenge the injury in a more cool and  contemptuous manner  Thus determined  he set on foot an inquiry into  the particulars of Jumble s parentage and education  He learnt that the  father of this insolent tutor was a brick layer  that his mother sold  pies  and that the son  in different periods of his youth  had amused  himself in both occupations  before he converted his views to the study  of learning  Fraught with this intelligence  he composed the following  ballad in doggerel rhymes  and next day  presented it as a gloss upon  the text which the tutor had chosen         Come  listen  ye students of every degree       I sing of a wit and a tutor perdie       A statesman profound  a critic immense       In short a mere jumble of learning and sense       And yet of his talents though laudably vain       His own family arts he could never attain       His father  intending his fortune to build       In his youth would have taught him the trowel to wield       But the mortar of discipline never would stick       For his skull was secured by a facing of brick       And with all his endeavours of patience and pain     6 22 15  3 45 PM   The skill of his sire he could never attain       His mother  a housewife neat  artful  and wise       Renown d for her delicate biscuit and pies       soon alter d his studies  by flattering his taste       From the raising of walls to the rearing of paste       But all her instructions were fruitless and vain       The pie making mystery he ne er could attain       Yet true to his race  in his labours were seen      A jumble of both their professions  I ween       For  when his own genius he ventured to trust       His pies seemed of brick  and his houses of crust       Then good Mr  Tutor  pray be not so vain       Since your family arts you could never attain   This impudent production was the most effectual vengeance he could  have taken on his tutor  who had all the supercilious arrogance and  ridiculous pride of a low born pedant  Instead of overlooking this  petulant
