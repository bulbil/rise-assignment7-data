and so I went  for how can I   help being at his beck  which grieves me not a little  though he is my   master  as I may say  for I am so wholly in his power  that it would   do me no good to incense him  and if I refused to obey him in little   matters  my refusal in greater would have the less weight  So I went   down to the garden  but as he walked in one walk  I took another  that I   might not seem too forward neither       He soon  spied me  and said  Do you expect to be courted to come to me    Sir  said I  and crossed the walk to attend him  I did not know but I   should interrupt you in your meditations this good day       Was that the case  said he  truly  and from your heart  Why  sir  said   I  I don t doubt but you have very good thoughts sometimes  though not   towards me  I wish  said he  I could avoid thinking so well of you as   I do  But where are the papers   I dare say you had them about you   yesterday  for you say in those I have  that you will bury your writings   in the garden  for fear you should be searched  if you did not escape    This  added he  gave me a glorious pretence to search you  and I have   been vexing myself all night  that I did not strip you garment by   garment  till I had found them  O fie  sir  said I  let me not be   scared  with hearing that you had such a thought in earnest       Well  said he  I hope you have not now the papers to give me  for I had   rather find them myself  I ll assure you       I did not like this way of talk at all  and thinking it best not to   dwell upon it  said  Well  but  sir  you will excuse me  I hope  giving   up my papers       Don t trifle with me  said he  Where are they   I think I was very good   to you last night  to humour you as I did  If you have either added   or diminished  and have not strictly kept your promise  woe be to you    Indeed  sir  said I  I have neither added nor diminished  But there is   the parcel that goes on with my sad attempt to escape  and the terrible   consequences it had like to have been followed with  And it goes down to   the naughty articles you sent me  And as you know all that has happened   since  I hope these will satisfy you       He was going to speak  but I said  to drive him from thinking of any   more  And I must beg you  sir  to read the matter favourably  if I have   exceeded in any liberties of my pen       I think  said he  half smiling  you may wonder at my patience  that I   can be so easy to read myself abused as I am by such a saucy slut   Sir    said I  I have wondered you should be so desirous to see my bold stuff    and  for that very reason  I have thought it a very good  or a very bad   sign  What  said he  is your good sign   That it may have an effect upon   your temper  at last  in my favour  when you see me so sincere  Your   bad sign  Why  that if you can read my reflections and observations upon   your treatment of me  with tranquillity  and not be moved  it is a sign   of a very cruel and determined heart  Now  pray  sir  don t be angry at   my boldness in telling you so freely my thoughts  You may  perhaps  said   he  be least mistaken  when you think of your bad sign  God forbid  said   I       So I took out my papers  and said  Here  sir  they are  But if you   please to return them  without breaking the seal  it will be very   generous  and I will take it for a great favour  and a good omen       He broke the seal instantly  and opened them  So much for your omen    replied he  I am sorry for it  said I  very seriously  and was walking   away  Whither now  said he  I was going in  sir  that you might have   time
