shall venture to speak the Sentiments  which at present occur to me on that Head  without waiting to recollect whether I have said the same Things to you before or no  or whether any one has said them before me   The Doctrine of eternal Misery establishes the Empire of the Devil  for twenty Men must be damned  for one that can be saved  upon the orthodox Christian Scheme  and the Mediator has suffered in vain   Suppose  during the Millennium of the Just  there should be a Millennium of the Unjust — don t you think a thousand Years Sufferings may make sufficient Atonement to divine Justice  And I think the popish Doctrine of Purgatory only absurd in the Opinion  that any Merits of the Living can avail the Dead there  However  this wild Notion may be considered as a pious Fraud to be of Service in Religion  as it multiplies our Inducements to Devotion — As for Example  If I thought my dear Fanny was receiving many Stripes there for her Crossness to me  no Anchorite ever led such an exemplary Page  322 Life  as I should  to rescue my own spoiled Pet   Infinite Justice  they say  requires infinite Satisfaction  Perhaps this is only a Quibble upon Words  But  to take it their own Way  has not the Mediator s Suffering already given this infinite Satisfaction  and must every miserable Wretch  who dies in Sin  become an additional Victim to infinite Justice  In short  this shocking Doctrine seems rather to be a Piece of Priest s Rage  than divine Wrath  and is such a blasphemous Opinion of the Godhead  as exceeds almost any of those Lay Crimes  they anathematize so vehemently and presumptuously at the same Time  and are not aware that they reduce God to a Kind of Fate  while  by extending his Justice  they limit his Mercy  and so peremptorily destroy the Power of free Will in the Exercise of his Attributes  But I cannot let this infinite Satisfaction pass by so quietly  without shewing that it proves nothing  by proving too much  for infinite Satisfaction must be infinite every Way  in Degree as well as Duration  then this destroys the equitable Rule of proportionable Punishments  for the least Crime requires Satisfaction  infinite Satisfaction  infinite in Degree  and infinite in Duration — so that a Man must be made a God  before he can be rendered capable of giving such infinite Satisfaction   Page  323I have not done with this Subject  and shall resume it in my next  for the Post is just going out  Adieu  my own Fanny  Read and write  my charming Pupil  while I endeavour to reflect that Light back again upon you  which you first inspired me with   LETTER CCCXIV   My Dear FANNY   I AM just come home  My Uncle is as usual  or  as some Man construed Queen Anne s Motto  semper eadem  worse and worse   Every Thing here in a backward and neglected Way — Why do not you come done  and set Matters to rights  I hope in God I shall not be long the only Slave in your Affairs  I have many Things to take care of  and there is but one Person  I can  or should chuse to confide in  and her Help I am deprived of  O my Soul  keep steddy to your Philosophy  for my old Friend Providence will not forsake you   I have finished Manners  and still think of that Book  as I did in my last  and could point out several Passages  to shew that it is rather a Collection  than an original Work  I do not mean from his general Reasoning  which  if right  cannot avoid being the same with others  Page  324 who have wrote justly upon the same Subject  but what I would instance  are particular Turns of Thought and Expression  which I have met with before  There is one among them taken from Montesquieu s Persian Letters   That it appears more reasonable  that the Minority  instead of the Majority  should determine a Question  for ten Men think wrong  for one who judges right   The only Difference between this Whim in the Lettres Persanes  and this Book  is  that Montesquieu only threw out this Sentiment as a Stroke of Fancy  but our Moralist seems to advance it as a grave Argument  and supports it by a Text from Exodus  disingenuously quoted  His Words are  that the Jewish Legislator advises us  not to pass our Judgment according to the Opinion of the greater Number   which Words do certainly support his ridiculous Argument  But observe the literal Words of the Text  and you will see how unfairly he deals with it   Thou shalt not follow a Multitude  to do evil  neither shalt thou speak in a Cause  to decline after many  to wrest Judgment   Exod  xxiii 2  Adieu     Henry   Page  325  LETTER CCCXV   I HAVE but just Time to tell my sweet Love that I have spent the greatest Part of this Day with my dear Lady —  She came to Town on Sunday Night  and sent to me Yesterday  Indeed she is a charming Woman
