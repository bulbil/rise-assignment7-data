was therefore necessary to set out that very night for court  whither I come to solicit my pardon  and hope to obtain it by your generous intercession with the prime minister   The gallant son of Don Anastasio thus closed his narrative  after which I observed  with a self sufficient physiognomy  It is well  Signor Don Roger  the offence seems to me to be venial  I will undertake to lay the case before his excellency  and may venture to promise you his protection  The thanks my client lavished would have passed in at one ear and out at the other  if they had not been backed by assurances of more substantial gratitude  But when once that string was touched  every nerve and fibre of my frame vibrated in unison  On the very same day did I relate the whole story to the duke  who allowed me to present the gentleman  and addressed him thus  Don Roger  I have been informed of the duel which has brought you to court  Santillane has laid all the particulars before me  Make yourself perfectly easy  you have done nothing but what the circumstances of the case might almost warrant  and it is especially on the ground of wounded honour  that his Majesty is best pleased to extend his grace and favour  You must be committed for mere form s sake  but you may depend on it  your confinement shall be of short duration  In Santillane you have a zealous friend  who will watch over your interests  and hasten your release   Don Roger paid his respectful acknowledgments to the minister  on whose pledge he went and surrendered himself His pardon was soon made out  owing to my activity  In less than ten days  I sent this modern Telemachus home  to say  how do you do   to his Ulysses and Penelope  had he stood upon the merits of his case without a protector  he might have whined out a year s imprisonment  and scarcely have got off at last  My commission was but a poor hundred pistoles  It was no very magnificent haul  but I was not as yet a Calderona  to turn up my nose at the small fry       CH  IX     Gil Blas makes a large fortune in a short time  and behaves like other wealthy upstarts   THIS affair gave me a relish for my trade  and ten pistoles to Scipio by way of brokerage  whetted his eagerness to start more game of the same sort  I have already done justice to his talents that way  he might as modestly have appended  the great  to the tail of his name  as the most noted scoundrel of antiquity  The second customer he brought me was a printer  who manufactured books of chivalry  and had made his fortune by waging war against common sense  This printer had pirated a work belonging to a brother printer  and his edition had been seized  For three hundred ducats I rescued his copies out of jeopardy  and saved him from a heavy fine  Though this was a transaction beneath the prime minister s notice  his excellency condescended at my request to interpose his authority  After the printer  a merchant passed through my hands  the occasion was thus  A Portuguese vessel had been taken by a Barbary corsair  and re taken by a privateer from Cadiz  Two thirds of the cargo belonged to a merchant at Lisbon  who  having claimed his due to no purpose  came to the court of Spain in search of a protector  with sufficient credit to procure him restitution  I took up his cause  and he recovered his property  deducting the sum of four hundred pistoles  paid to me in consideration of my disinterested zeal for justice   And now most surely the reader will call out to me at this place  Well said  good master Santillane  Make hay while the sun shines  You are on the high road to fortune  push forward  and outstrip your rivals  Oh  let me alone for that  I spy  or my eyes deceive me  my servant coming in with a new gull that he has just caught  Even so  It is my very Scipio  Let us hear what he has to say  Sir  quoth he  give me leave to introduce this eminent practitioner  He wants a licence to sell his drugs during the term of ten years in all the towns of the Spanish monarchy  to the exclusion of all other quacks  in short  a monopoly of poisons  In gratitude for this patent to thin mankind  he will present the donor with a gratuity of two hundred pistoles  I looked superciliously  like a patron  at the mountebank  and told him that his business should be done  As lameness and leprosy would have it  in the course of a few days I sent him on his progress through Spain  invested with full powers to make the world his oyster  and leave nothing but the shell to his unpatented competitors   Besides that my avarice outran my accumulating wealth  I had obtained the four boons just specified so easily from his grace  as not to be mealy mouthed about asking for a fifth  The town of Vera  on the coast of Grenada  wanted a governor
