of   concern for somewhat  Hide nothing from me  Pamela  Only  sir  said I    he knew not how to absent himself from divine service  and yet is afraid   of disgracing you by appearing       Fie  Mr  Andrews  said he  I thought you knew that the outward   appearance was nothing  I wish I had as good a habit inwardly as you   have  But I ll tell you  Pamela  your father is not so much thinner than   I am  nor much shorter  he and I will walk up together to my wardrobe    though it is not so well stored here  as in Bedfordshire       And so  said he  pleasantly  don t you pretend to come near us  till   I call for you  for you must not yet see how men dress and undress   themselves  O sir  said my father  I beg to be excused  I am sorry you   were told  So am not I  said my master  Pray come along with me       He carried him up stairs  and shewed him several suits  and would have   had him take his choice  My poor father was quite confounded  for my   master saw not any he thought too good  and my father none that he   thought bad enough  And my good master  at last   he fixed his eye upon   a fine drab  which he thought looked the plainest   would help him to   try the coat and waistcoat on himself  and  indeed  one would not   have thought it  because my master is taller  and rather plumper  as I   thought but  as I saw afterwards  they fitted him very well  And being   plain  and lined with the same colour  and made for travelling in a   coach  pleased my poor father much  He gave him the whole suit  and    calling up Mrs  Jewkes  said  Let these clothes be well aired against   tomorrow morning  Mr  Andrews brought only with him his common apparel    not thinking to stay Sunday with us  And pray see for some of my   stockings  and whether any of my shoes will fit him  And see also for   some of my linen  for we have put the good man quite out of his course    by keeping him Sunday over  He was then pleased to give him the silver   buckles out of his own shoes  So  my good mother  you must expect to see   my dear father a great beau  Wig  said my master  he wants none  for   his own venerable white locks are better than all the perukes in   England   But I am sure I have hats enough somewhere   I ll take care of   every thing  sir  said Mrs  Jewkes   And my poor father  when he came to   me  could not refrain tears  I know not how  said he  to comport myself   under these great favours  O my child  it is all owing to the divine   goodness  and your virtue          Sunday       This blessed day all the family seemed to take delight to equip   themselves for the celebration of the Sabbath in the little chapel    and Lady Jones and Mr  Williams came in her chariot  and the two Misses   Darnford in their own  And we breakfasted together in a most agreeable   manner  My dear father appeared quite spruce and neat  and was quite   caressed by the three ladies  As we were at breakfast  my master told   Mr  Williams  We must let the Psalms alone  he doubted  for want of   a clerk  but Mr  Williams said  No  nothing should be wanting that he   could supply  My father said  If it might be permitted him  he would  as   well as he was able  perform that office  for it was always what he had   taken delight in  And as I knew he had learnt psalmody formerly  in his   youth  and had constantly practised it in private  at home  on Sunday   evenings   as well as endeavoured to teach it in the little school he   so unsuccessfully set up  at the beginning of his misfortunes  before   he took to hard labour   I was in no pain for his undertaking it in this   little congregation  They seemed much pleased with this  and so we went   to chapel  and made a pretty tolerable appearance  Mrs  Jewkes  and all   the servants  attending  but the cook  And I never saw divine service   performed with more solemnity  nor assisted at with greater devotion   and decency  my master  Lady Jones  and the two misses
