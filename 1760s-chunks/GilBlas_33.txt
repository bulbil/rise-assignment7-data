thoughts  but the next day  having again taken my station at the window  I saw him on the self same spot  and again found myself the object of his eager gaze  This seemed strange  I looked at him in my turn  and  after an attentive scrutiny  thought I could trace the features of the unhappy Don Alvar  This seeming visit from the tombs roused all the dormant agony of my soul  and extorted from me a piercing scream  Happily  I was then alone with Inès  who of all my women engaged the largest share of my confidence  I told her what surmise had so agitated my spirits  She only laughed at the idea  and took it for granted that a slight resemblance had imposed on my fancy  Take courage  madam  said she  and do not be afraid of seeing your first husband  What likelihood is there of his being here in the disguise of a peasant  Is it even within the reach of credibility that he is yet alive  However  I will go down into the garden  and talk with this rustic  I will answer for finding out who be is  and will return in all possible haste with my intelligence  Inès ran on her errand like a lapwing  but soon returned to my apartment with a face of mingled astonishment and emotion  Madam  exclaimed she  your conjecture is but too well grounded  it is indeed Don Alvar whom you have seen  he made himself known at once  and pleads for a private interview   As I had the means of admitting Don Alvar instantaneously  by the absence of the Marquis at Burgos  I commissioned my waiting maid to introduce him into my closet by a private staircase  Well may you imagine the hurry and agitation of my spirits  How could I support the presence of a man  who was entitled to overwhelm me with reproaches  I fainted at his very foot fall as he entered  They were about me in a moment    he as well as Inès  and when they had recovered me from my swoon  Don Alvar said    Madam  for heaven s sake  compose yourself  My presence shall never be the cause of pain to you  nor would I for the world expose you to the slightest anxiety  I am no savage husband  come to account with you for a sacred pledge  nor do I impute to criminal motives the second contract you have formed  I am well aware that it was owing to the importunity of your friends  your persecutions from that quarter are not unknown to me  Besides  the report of my death was current in Valladolid  and you had so much the more reason to give it credit  as no letter from me gave you any assurance to the contrary  In short  I am no stranger to your habits of life since our cruel separation  and know that necessity  not lightness of heart  has thrown you into the arms Ah  sir  interrupted I with sobs  why will you make excuses for your unworthy wife  She is guilty  since you survive  Why am I not still in the forlorn state in which I languished before my marriage with Don Ambrosio  Fatal nuptials     alas  but for these  I should at least have had the consolation in my wretchedness of seeing the object of my first vows again without a blush   My dear Mencia  replied Don Alvar  with a look which marked how deeply he was penetrated by my contrition  I make no complaint of you  and far from upbraiding you with your present prosperity  as heaven is my witness  I return it thanks for the favours it has showered on you  Since the sad day of my departure from Valladolid  my own fate has ever been adverse  My life has been but a tissue of misfortune  and  as a surcharge of evil destiny  I had no means of letting you hear from me  Too secure in your affection  I could neither think nor dream but of the condition to which my fatal love might have reduced you  Donna Mencia in tears was the lovely  but killing spectre that haunted me  of all my miseries  your dear idea was the most acute  Some times  I own  I felt remorse for the transporting crime of having pleased you  I wished you had lent an ear to the suit of some happier rival  since the preference with which you had honoured me was to fall so cruelly on your own head  To cut short my melancholy tale    after seven years of suffering  more enamoured than ever  I determined to see you once again  The impulse was not to be resisted  and the expiration of a long slavery having furnished me with the power of giving way to it  I have been at Valladolid under this disguise at the hazard of a discovery  There  I learned the whole story  I then came to this castle  and found the means of admission into the gardener s service  who has engaged me as a labourer  Such was my stratagem to obtain this private interview  But do not suppose me capable of blasting  by my continuance here  the happiness of your future days  I love you better
