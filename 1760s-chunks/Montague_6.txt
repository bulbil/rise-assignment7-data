 Vallier  the second bishop of Quebec  The house is  without  a very noble building  and neatness  elegance and propriety reign within  The nuns  who are all of the noblesse  are many of them handsome  and all genteel  lively  and well bred  they have an air of the world  their conversation is easy  spirited  and polite  with them you almost forget the recluse in the woman of condition  In short  you have the best nuns at the Ursulines  the most agreeable women at the General Hospital  all however have an air of chagrin  which they in vain endeavour to conceal  and the general eagerness with which they tell you unask d they are happy  is a strong proof of the contrary       Tho  the most indulgent of all men to the follies of others  especially such as have their source in mistaken devotion  tho  willing to allow all the world to play the fool their own way  yet I cannot help being fir d with a degree of zeal against an institution equally incompatible with public good  and private happiness  an institution which cruelly devotes beauty and innocence to slavery  regret  and wretchedness  to a more irksome imprisonment than the severest laws inflict on the worst of criminals       Could anything but experience  my dear Lucy  make it be believ d possible that there should be rational beings  who think they are serving the God of mercy by inflicting on themselves voluntary tortures  and cutting themselves off from that state of society in which he has plac d them  and for which they were form d  by renouncing the best affections of the human heart  the tender names of friend  of wife  of mother  and  as far as in them lies  counterworking creation  by spurning from them every amusement however innocent  by refusing the gifts of that beneficent power who made us to be happy  and destroying his most precious gifts  health  beauty  sensibility  chearfulness  and peace       My indignation is yet awake  from having seen a few days since at the Ursulines  an extreme lovely young girl  whose countenance spoke a soul form d for the most lively  yet delicate  ties of love and friendship  led by a momentary enthusiasm  or perhaps by a childish vanity artfully excited  to the foot of those altars  which she will probably too soon bathe with the bitter tears of repentance and remorse       The ceremony  form d to strike the imagination  and seduce the heart of unguarded youth  is extremely solemn and affecting  the procession of the nuns  the sweetness of their voices in the choir  the dignified devotion with which the charming enthusiast received the veil  and took the cruel vow which shut her from the world for ever  struck my heart in spite of my reason  and I felt myself touch d even to tears by a superstition I equally pity and despise       I am not however certain it was the ceremony which affected me thus strongly  it was impossible not to feel for this amiable victim  never was there an object more interesting  her form was elegance itself  her air and motion animated and graceful  the glow of pleasure was on her cheek  the fire of enthusiasm in her eyes  which are the finest I ever saw  never did I see joy so livelily painted on the countenance of the happiest bride  she seem d to walk in air  her whole person look d more than human       An enemy to every species of superstition  I must however allow it to be least destructive to true virtue in your gentle sex  and therefore to be indulg d with least danger  the superstition of men is gloomy and ferocious  it lights the fire  and points the dagger of the assassin  whilst that of women takes its color from the sex  is soft  mild  and benevolent  exerts itself in acts of kindness and charity  and seems only substituting the love of God to that of man       Who can help admiring  whilst they pity  the foundress of the Ursuline convent  Madame de la Peltrie  to whom the very colony in some measure owes its existence  young  rich and lovely  a widow in the bloom of life  mistress of her own actions  the world was gay before her  yet she left all the pleasures that world could give  to devote her days to the severities of a religion she thought the only true one  she dar d the dangers of the sea  and the greater dangers of a savage people  she landed on an unknown shore  submitted to the extremities of cold and heat  of thirst and hunger  to perform a service she thought acceptable to the Deity  To an action like this  however mistaken the motive  bigotry alone will deny praise  the man of candor will only lament that minds capable of such heroic virtue are not directed to views more conducive to their own and the general happiness       I am unexpectedly call d this moment  my dear Lucy  on some business to Montreal  from whence you shall hear from me       Adieu   ED  RIVERS    LETTER VI
