herself than she seems to have  when she is set a talking  She may  indeed  make a figure in a country assembly  but in the London world she must be not a little aukward  having never been here before       92   I take her to have a great deal of art  But to do her justice  she has no bad complexion  That you know is a striking advantage  Nor are her features  taking them either in whole or part  much amiss  But to me she has a babyish look  especially when she smiles  yet I suppose she has been told that her smiles become her  for she is always smiling—So like a simpleton  I was going to say      Upon the whole  I see nothing so engaging in her as to have made her the idol she is with every body—And what little beauty she has  it cannot last  For my part  were I a man  the clear Brunette—you will think I am praising myself    Miss Barnevelt would perhaps thus write to her Lucy—To her Lucy —Upon my word I will not let her have a Lucy—She shall have a brother man to write to  not a woman  and he shall have a fierce name  We will suppose that she also had been describing the rest of the company    Well but  my dear Bombardino  I am now to give you a description of Miss Byron   Tis the softest  gentlest  smiling rogue of a girl—I protest  I could five or six times have kissed her  for what she said  and for the manner she spoke in—For she has been used to prate  a favour d child in her own family  one may easily see that  Yet so prettily loth to speak till spoken to —Such a blushing little rogue — Tis a dear girl  and I wish d twenty times as I sat by her  that I had been a man for her sake  Upon my honour  Bombardino  I believe if I had  I should have caught her up  popt her under one of my arms  and run away with her    Something like this  my Lucy  did Miss Barnevelt once say   Having now dismissed the women  I come to Mr  Singleton  Mr  Walden  and Sir Hargrave   Mr  Walden  himself a Pasquin  would thus perhaps have written to his Marforio     93   The first Lady  whom  as the greatest stranger  I shall take upon me to describe  is Miss Harriet Byron of Northamptonshire  In her person she is not disagreeable  and most people think her pretty  But  what is prettiness  Why  nevertheless  in a woman  prettiness is—pretty  what other word can I so fitly use of a person who  tho  a little sightly  cannot be called a beauty  I will allow  that we men are not wrong in admiring modest women for the graces of their persons  But let them be modest  let them return the compliment  and revere Us for our capaciousness of mind  And so they will  if they are brought up to know their own weakness  and that they are but domestic animals of a superior order  Even ignorance  let me tell you  my Marforio  is pretty in a woman  Humility is one of their principal graces  Women hardly ever set themselves to acquire the knowlege that is proper to men  but they neglect for it  what more indispensably belongs to women  To have them come to their husbands  to their brothers  and even to their lovers  when they have a mind to know any thing out of their way  and beg to be instructed and informed  inspireth them with the becoming humility which I have touched upon  and giveth us importance with them        Indeed  my Marforio  there are very few topics that arise in conversation among men  upon which women ought to open their lips  Silence becomes them  Let them therefore hear  wonder  and improve  in silence  They are naturally contentious  and lovers of contradiction   Something like this Mr  Walden once threw out  And you know who  my Lucy  has said as much   and shall we qualify them to be disputants against ourselves        These reflections  Marforio  are not foreign to my subject  This girl  this Harriet Byron  is applauded for a young woman of reading and observation    94 vation  But there was another Lady present  Miss Clements  who  if there be any merit to a woman in it  appeareth to me to excel her in the compass of her reading  and that upon the strength of her own diligence and abilities  for this Miss Harriet hath had some pains taken with her by her late grandfather  a man of erudition  who had his education among us  This old gentleman  I am told  took it into his head  having no grandson  to give this girl a bookish turn  but he wisely stopt at her mother tongue  only giving her a smattering in French and Italian        As
