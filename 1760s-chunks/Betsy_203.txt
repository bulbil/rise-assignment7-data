 On the other hand  though one would imagine there needed but little   skill for the detection of so gross an imposition  yet Mr  Goodman s   lawyer thought proper to get all the help he could to corroborate the   truth  This piece of forgery was dated about ten days before Mr  Goodman   died  he knew that the elder Mr  Thoughtless came every day to visit him   during the whole time of his sickness  and that Miss Betsy  at the time   this will was supposed to be made  actually lived in the house  and that   neither of these two could be totally ignorant of such a transaction  in   case any such had been       It was therefore at the lawyer s request  that Miss Betsy was sent for   to her brother s house  she answered  with a great deal of readiness  to   all the questions he put to her  according to the best of her knowledge    particularly as to that concerning the making the will  she said  that   she had never heard the least mention of any lawyer but himself coming   to Mr  Goodman s during the whole time of his sickness  and that she   verily believed no will but that drawn up by him  and which all the   family knew of  could possibly be made by Mr  Goodman s orders  or in   his house  and as to the article in the pretended will  relating to Miss   Flora  nothing could be a more palpable forgery  because Mr  Goodman had   offered five hundred pounds with her in marriage to a linen draper  not   above six weeks before his parting with Lady Mellasin   Which   added   she   is a very plain proof that he never intended her for his nephew        All the time Miss Betsy staid  the whole discourse was on this affair    and she had no opportunity  as the lawyer was present  to acquaint her   brothers with any thing concerning Sir Frederick Fineer  as otherwise it   was her full intention to have done  after the surprizing injunction he   had laid upon her of secrecy  in regard of his passion  and every thing   relating to him                CHAPTER XI       Is very well deserving the attention of all those who are about to   marry          While Miss Flora was buoyed up with the expectation that her mother   would soon be reconciled with Mr  Goodman  she abated not of her former   gaiety  and thought of nothing but indulging her amorous inclinations   with the man she liked  but when once those expectations ceased  her   spirits began to fail  she now found it necessary  for her interest as   well as pleasure  to preserve  if possible  the affection of her lover    she knew not what dreadful consequences the prosecution Mr  Goodman was   about to exhibit against her mother  might be attended with  and   trembled to think she must share with her the double load of infamy and   penury  and rightly judged  that a man of Mr  Trueworth s fortune    honour  and good nature  would not suffer a woman  with whom he   continued a tender communication  to be oppressed with any ills his   purse could relieve her from  The apprehensions  therefore  that she   might one day be reduced to stand in need of his support  assisted the   real passion she had for him  and made her feel  on the first appearance   of his growing coldness towards her  all those horrors  those   distractions  which her letters to him had so lively represented       On his ceasing to make any fixed appointment with her  and from seeing   her every day  to seeing her once in three or four days  gave her  with   reason  the most terrible alarms  but when  after an absence of near a   week  she had followed him to the coffee house  the cool and indifferent   reception she there met with  gave  indeed  a mortal stab to all her   hopes  and she longer hesitated to pronounce her own doom  and cry out    she was undone       The excuse he made of business was too weak  too trite  too   common place  to gain any credit with her  or alleviate her sorrows  she   knew the world too well to imagine a gay young gentleman  like him    would forego whatever he thought a pleasure for any business he could   possibly have  she doubted not but there was a woman in the case  and   the thoughts that  while she was in vain expecting him  he was   soliciting those favours from a rival she
