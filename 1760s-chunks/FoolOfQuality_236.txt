   Ah  nurse   said Mrs  Fielding  we were quite mistaken in the   woman whom we suspected to be the kidnapper  and so that affiair   is all over again      I have nothing to say  cried nurse  to this woman or t other   woman   but you must riot have another body s child put upon you    If he is indeed your son  I shall know him in an instant   I should   know him from all the children that ever were born  Why  nurse    cried Mrs  Fielding eagerly  do you know of any natural mark  or   mole  or spot  by which you could guess at him   He had no such   spot upon him  madam   but  if he be a living boy  he has a mark   of my own making that never will out  and that s the reason that   I never dared to tell you of it  What mark  nurse  what mark    tell me instantly  I beg you      Why  madam  you must know as how the weather was very cold    it being twelfth day in Christmas holidays  So you and my master   were from home on visiting  and I had a rousing fire down  and my   child stood by my knee  being just then twelve months nineteen   days old  and as sturdy a fellow of his age and inches as any could   desire to see  So the cat  all at once  threw down some crockery         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  247     ware behind me  Up I started  to be sure  and run to save the   vessels   but  hearing my child scream  I turned much nimbler back   again  and found him fallen with his little neck against the upper   bar of the grate  It was well that I didn t die on the spot  for   then he must have died too  So I whipped him up in my arms    but he shrieked and roared terribly  So I got some softening   cream and spread it over the burn  and I put a plaster upon that   again   and I covered the place from day to day so well with his   cap  that neither you nor my master knew any thing of the matter    But the shape of his hurt went so deep into my heart and into my   memory  that  as I was saying  and still say  I should know him by   it again among all the children in all the world      Go then  my dear nurse  cried Mrs  Fielding   go immediately    and examine if this boy has your mark upon him  Is this the   master  madam  whom you suspect to be your son  It is  nurse  it   is   my heart took a liking to him the first moment I saw him   he   too was stolen from his parents  and may as well be my son as the   son of another      Here nurse made a hasty step or two toward Ned  but suddenly   stopping and turning pale Ah  madam  she cried  I wish you   would go and try yourself   the wound  if he has it  is just under his   right ear   for if I should find  indeed  that he is my very child  I   shall certainly run mad on the very spot for joy  I dare not tiy    nurse  I dare not try for the world  said Mrs  Fielding  I am   already all of a tremble  I know not how      Nurse  then plucking up a little resolution  stepped suddenly to   Ned  and turned up his hair   when  giving a loud scream  she had   just the power to cry out  My child  my child  my child  and   dropped down in an anguishing fit of hysterics      Mrs  Fielding  on hearing her nurse cry out  rose hastily from her   chair  and would have gone to embrace her son  but falling instantly   back she fainted away  The poor nurse  however  was not so   happy  She broke forth at times into convulsive peals of laughter    that made the house ring   and again she fell into fits of weeping    so outrageous and bitterly desolate  as no heart under the temper of   adamant could support      While the family were all in bustle  applying remedies to their   patients  Mrs  Fielding recovered  and hearing the cries of her   nurse  she went and kneeled down by her  and wept with her   and over her  while her tears proved a seasonable
