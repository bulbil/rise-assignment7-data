informed me for certain that this gentleman s eldest son  Captain Primrose  was gone off to America with his new married lady     My sweetest miss    cried my wife    he has told you nothing but falsehoods  My son George never left the kingdom  nor never was married  Tho  you have forsaken him  he has always loved you too well to think of any body else  and I have heard him say he would die a batchellor for your sake    She then proceeded to expatiate upon the sincerity of her son s passion  she set his duel with Mr  Thornhill in a proper light  from thence she made a rapid digression to the  Squire s debaucheries  his pretended marriages  and ended with a most insulting picture of his cowardice   Page  197     Good heavens    cried Miss Wilmot    how very near have  I been to the brink of ruin  But how great is my pleasure to have escaped it  Ten thousand falsehoods has this gentleman told me  He had at last art enough to persuade me that my promise to the only man I esteemed was no longer binding  since he had been unfaithful  By his falsehoods I was taught to detest one equally brave and generous    But by this time my son was freed from the incumbrances of justice  Mr  Jenkinson also  who had acted as his valet de chambre  had dressed up his hair  and furnished him with whatever was necessary to make a genteel appearance  He now therefore entered  handsomely drest in his regimentals  and  without vanity   for I am above it  he appeared as handsome a fellow as ever wore a military dress   Page  198  As he entered  he made Miss Wilmot a modest and distant bow  for he was not as yet acquainted with the change which the eloquence of his mother had wrought in his favour  But no decorums could restrain the impatience of his blushing mistress to be forgiven  Her tears  her looks  all contributed to discover the real sensations of her heart for having forgotten her former promise and having suffered herself to be deluded by an impostor  My son appeared amazed at her condescension  and could scarce believe it real —     Sure  madam    cried he    this is but delusion  I can never have merited this  To be blest thus is to be too happy    —   No  Sir    replied she    I have been deceived  basely deceived  else nothing could have ever made me unjust to my promise  You know my friendship  you have long known it  but forget what I have done  and as you once had my warmest vows of  Page  199  constancy  you shall now have them repeated  and be assured that if your Arabella cannot be yours  she shall never be another s    —   And no other s you shall be    cried Sir William    if I have any influence with your father    This hint was sufficient for my son Moses  who immediately flew to the inn where the old gentleman was  to inform him of every circumstance that had happened  But in the mean time the  Squire perceiving that he was on every side undone  now finding that no hopes were left from flattery or dissimulation  concluded that his wisest way would be to turn and face his pursuers  Thus laying aside all shame  he appeared the open hardy villain      I find then    cried he    that I am to expect no justice here  but I am resolved it shall be done me  You shall know  Sir    turning to Sir William    I am no  Page  200  longer a poor dependant upon your favours  I scorn them  Nothing can keep Miss Wilmot s fortune from me  which  I thank her father s assiduity  is pretty large  The articles  and a bond for her fortune  are signed  and safe in my possession  It was her fortune  not her person  that induced me to wish for this match  and possessed of the one  let whose will take the other    This was an alarming blow  Sir William was sensible of the justice of his claims  for he had been instrumental in drawing up the marriage articles himself  Miss Wilmot therefore perceiving that her fortune was irretrievably lost  turning to my son  she asked if the loss of fortune could lessen her value to him      Though fortune    said she    is out of my power  at least I have my hand to give    Page  201     And that  madam    cried her real lover    was indeed all that you ever had to give  at least all that I ever thought worth the acceptance  And I now protest  my Arabella  by all that s happy  your want of fortune this moment encreases my pleasure  as it serves to convince my sweet girl of
