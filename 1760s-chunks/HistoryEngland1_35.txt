exactions  thus daily committed upon the churches  compelled the Bishops to carry their complaints to the Pope himself  but the King still vindicated the legate s conduct  At length  the prelates  quite tired with the repeated demands of the legate  who daily had some new pretext for getting money  resolved to meet and consider of some remedy to prevent his rapacity  They accordingly assembled  but had scarce begun to complain to each other of the miseries they suffered  when the legate entered the assembly  with a demand for more money  this they considered as an accumulation of impudence and extortion  and they gave him a blunt denial  The legate  being disappointed  for this time left the assembly  and went to pillage the Scotch clergy with better prospects of success   An accident happened about this time  which serves as a strong instance of the submission the people yielded to the power of Rome  Some business induced the legate to take Oxford in his way  he was received with all that grandeur and magnificence  which  from his character  he had a right to expect  As the luxury  in which these Italian dignitaries lived  was great  several scholars of the University  while the legate s dinner was preparing  entered his kitchen  incited by motives of curiosity or hunger  While they here and there admired the opulence and luxury of all they saw  a poor Irish scholar ventured to beg relief from the cook  the cook  instead of giving an alms  threw a ladle full of boiling water in his face    103 an action which so provoked a Welch student who was present  that  having a bow in his hand  he shot the cook dead with an arrow  The legate  hearing the tumult  retired in a fright to the tower of the church  where he remained till nightfall  As soon as he thought he might retire with safety  he hastened to the King  and complained of this outrage  The King  with his usual meanness  flew into a violent passion  and offered to give immediate satisfaction  by putting the offenders to death  The legate  at first  seemed to insist upon vengeance  but  at length  was appeased  by proper submission from the University  all the scholars of that school  which had offended him  were ordered to be stripped of their gowns  and to walk barefoot  with halters about their necks  to the legate s house  and humbly crave pardon and absolution  It would be no easy matter to bring the students of Oxford to such an humiliation at present   In this manner this brutal and capricious tyrant went on  leagued with the Pope against his own dominions  He had now neither barons nor clergy in his interest  and owed all his support to the authority of the papal and royal names  The Pope continued to make reiterated demands upon the clergy  and the King would beg from his subjects at their own houses  as if he had been asking charity  At one time he would get money  by pretending to take the crusade  at another he would prevail  by going to re conquer his dominions in France  again he would extort aid  under pretext of portioning a relation  and he would frequently assure his parliament of barons  that  though he had hitherto behaved unworthily  yet  upon being supplied once more  with proper assistance  he would reform    104 and give universal satisfaction  Thus he drew forth various sums  which  without shame  he bestowed upon flatterers  panders to his pleasures  or an army of foreigners  which he kept to intimidate his native dominions   At length  however  the parliament  fatigued with his unperforming promises  resolved to refuse his demands for the future  they therefore entered into an association  and the city of London was invited to accede  At the head of this powerful combination was the Earl of Leicester  the King s brother in law  who had risen into power merely by his master s profuseness  The King  by a strange absurdity of thinking  as he became more feeble and unpopular  increased his demands for fresh supplies  He was worsted in France  and obliged to purchase a shameful truce  He was conquered by the Welch  and became contemptible to Scotland  yet  still he continued to harrass his own subjects with his usual extortion  as if he designed to create in them that awe with which he failed to impress his enemies  The barons  finding him incorrigible  after an experience of near forty years  at length shook off their allegiance  and sent the King notice  that they renounced the fealty they owed him  and now considered him only as the common enemy of mankind   Both sides were now up in arms  and the country again became the theatre of civil slaughter  The first advantages in this contest were in favour of the King  he was a coward in danger  and shewed himself a tyrant in victory  Flushed with the success with which his arms had been just crowned  he resolved to march directly to London  He made no doubt but the city  intimidated   105 by his late advantages  would declare in his favour  and  had he formerly
