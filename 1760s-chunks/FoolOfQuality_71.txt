   Friend  Laying Peter aside  who think you was the greatest hero   among the moderns       Author  To confess the truth  among all that I have heard or   read of  the hero whom I most affect was a madman  and the   lawgiver whom I most affect was a fool      Friend  Troth  I believe you never would have been the writer    you are at this day  if you had not adopted somewhat of both the   said qualities  But come  unriddle  I beseech you   where may this   favourite hero and legislator be found      Author  In a fragment of the Spanish history  bequeathed to   the world by one Signior Cervantes      Friend  O   have you led me to my old acquaintance   pray  has   not your Pegasus some smatch of the qualities of the famous   liosinante       Author  Quite as chaste  I assure you  But I perceive that you   think I am drolling   you do not suppose that you can ever be   seriously of the same opinion  Yet  if you demand of your own   memory  for what have the great heroes throughout history been   renowned   it must answer  for mischief merely  for spreading deso    lation and calamity among men  How greatly  how gloriously  how   divinely superior was our hero of the Mancha  who went about   righting of wrongs  and redressing of injuries  lifting up the fallen    and pulling down those whom iniquity had exalted  In this his   marvellous undertaking  what buffetings  what bruisings  what   trampling of ribs  what pounding of packstaves did his bones not   endure   Mine ached at the recital   But toil was his bed of   down  and the house of pain was to him a bower of delight  w r hile   he considered himself as engaged in giving ease  advantage  and   happiness to others  If events did not answer to the enterprises   of his heart  it is not to be imputed to the man but to his malady           THE FOOL OF QUALITY  45     for  had his power and success been as extensive as his benevolence    all things awry upon earth would instantly have been set as straight   as a cedar      But let me turn  with reverence  to kiss the hem of the robes of   the most respectable of all governors and legislators  Sancho Pansa    What judgments   what institutions   how are Minos  and Solon  and   the inspired of the goddess  Egeria here eclipsed   Sancho  thou   wast a peasant  thou wast illiterate  thou wast a dunce for a man    but an angel for a governor   inasmuch as  contrary to the custom   of all other governors  thou didst not desire any thing  thou didst   not wish for any thing  thine eye was not bent to any thing save the   good of thy people   therefore  thou could st not stray  thou hadst   no other way to travel  Could  Esop s log have been moved to   action upon the same principle  the regency of storks had not pre    vailed among men  How am I provoked  Pansa  when I see thee   insulted   How am I grieved when I find thee deposed   Saving   the realms of a certain majesty  I say  and sigh to myself that   the whole earth were as thine island of Barataria  and thou  Sancho    the legislator and the ruler thereof      Friend  I feel conviction   I confess it  But tell me  I pray you    why has the world  through all ages and nations  universally as    cribed heroism and glory to conquest      Author  Through the respect  as I take it  that they have for   power  Man is by nature weak   he is born in and to a state of   dependence   he therefore naturally seeks and looks about for help     and where he observes the greatest power  it is there that he   applies and prays for protection  Now  though this power should   be exerted to his damage instead of defence  it makes no alteration   in his reverence for it   he bows while he trembles  and while he   detests he worships  In the present case  it is with man as it is   with God   he is not so awful and striking   he is not so much   attended to in the sunshine and gentle dews of his providence and   benignity  as in his lightnings and thunders  his clouds and his
