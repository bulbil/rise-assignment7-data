here  and her teeth followed her cloaths  at last she played for her left eye  and  oh  hard fate  this too she lost  however  she had the consolation of biting the sharper  for he never perceived   150 that it was made of glass till it became his own   How happy  my friend  are the English ladies  who never rise to such an inordinance of passion  Though the sex here are naturally fond of games of chance  and are taught to manage games of skill from their infancy  yet they never pursue ill fortune with such amazing intrepidity  Indeed I may entirely acquit them of ever playing—I mean of playing for their eyes or their teeth   It is true  they often stake their fortune  their beauty  health  and reputations at a gaming table  It even sometimes happens  that they play their husbands into a jail  yet still they preserve a decorum unknown to our wives and daughters of China  I have been present at a route in this country  where a woman of fashion  after losing her money  has sat writhing in all the agonies of bad luck  and yet  after all  never once attempted to strip a single petticoat  or cover the board  as her last stake  with her head cloaths   However  though I praise their moderation at play  I must not conceal their assiduity  In China our women  except upon some great days  are never permitted to finger a dice box  but here every day seems to be a festival  and night itself  which gives others rest  only serves to encrease the female gamester s industry  I have been told of an old lady in the country  who being given over by the physicians  played with the curate of her parish to pass the time away  having won all his money  she next proposed playing for her funeral charges  the   151 proposal was accepted  but unfortunately the lady expired just as she had taken in her game   There are some passions  which though differently pursued  are attended with equal consequences in every country  here they game with more perseverance  there with greater fury  here they strip their families  there they strip themselves naked  A lady in China  who indulges a passion for gaming  often becomes a drunkard  and by flourishing a dice box in one hand  she generally comes to brandish a dram cup in the other  Far be it from me to say there are any who drink drams in England  but it is natural to suppose  that when a lady has lost every thing else but her honour  she wi•l be apt to toss that into the bargain  and grown insensible to nicer feelings  behave like the Spaniard  who  when all his money was gone  endeavoured to borrow more  by offering to pawn his whisker  Adieu   LETTER C  From Lien Chi Altangi to      Merchant in Amsterdam   I HAVE just received a letter from my son  in which he informs me of the fruitlessness of his endeavours to recover the lady with whom he fled from Persia  He strives to cover under the appearance of fortitude a heart torn with anxiety and disappointment  I have offered little consolation  since that but too frequently feeds the sorrow which it pretends to deplore  and strengthens the   152 impression  which nothing but the external rubs of time and accident can thoroughly efface   He informs me of his intentions of quitting Moscow the first opportunity  and travelling by land to Amsterdam  I must therefore  upon his arrival  entreat the continuance of your friendship  and beg of you to provide him with proper directions for finding me in London  You can scarcely be sensible of the joy I expect upon seeing him once more  the ties between the father and the son among us of China are much more closely drawn than with you of Europe   The remittances sent me from Argun to Moscow came in safety  I cannot sufficiently admire that spirit of honesty  which prevails through the whole country of Siberia  perhaps the savages of that desolate region are the only untutored people of the globe  that cultivate the moral virtues  even without knowing that their actions merit praise  I have been told surprising things of their goodness  benevolence  and generosity  and the uninterrupted commerce between China and Russia serves as a collateral confirmation   Let us  says the Chinese law giver  admire the rude virtues of the ignorant  but rather imitate the delicate morals of the polite  In the country where I reside  though honesty and benevolence be not so congenial  yet art supplies the place of nature  Though here every vice is carried to excess  yet every virtue is practised also with unexampled superiority  A city like this is the soil for great virtues and great vices  the villain can soon improve here in the   153 deepest mysteries of deceiving  and the practical philosopher can every day meet new incitements to mend his honest intentions  There are no pleasures  sensual or sentimental  which this city does not produce  yet  I know not how  I could not be content to reside here for life  There is something so seducing in that spot
