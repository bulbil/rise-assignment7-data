fortune had disposed of you otherwise  before I saw lady Bidulph  This she quickly informed me of  and I will own to you  madam  that as I found there was now an insuperable bar to Mr Faulkland’s hopes  I was mean enough not to have the courage to speak truth  I saw it could not avail him  in regard to his prospects with you  Lady Bidulph’s eye awed me  yet I think she led me into a justification of myself  so great were her prejudices against Mr Faulkland  Or  perhaps  having already disposed of you in marriage  in vindication of this step  she did not wish to be undeceived  Yes  again  in spite of my confusion  I must repeat it  I was not sincere  I threw out such hints to lady Bidulph  as must have made her think Mr Faulkland had taken pains to undo me  to this act of    disingenuousness  my sole motive was  that I might appear in a less culpable light in the eyes of a lady of such strict virtue as your mother  By making her my friend  I was in hopes one day of making you so too  Devoted  as Mr Faulkland was  to the most charming woman in the world  I was not afraid of his making a second choice  I thought  if he were to be induced to marry  he might  in time  be prevailed upon to turn his thoughts towards me  In this hope I have dragged on so many tedious years  I was not mistaken in my opinion  that he could find none worthy to succeed Mrs Arnold in his heart  He loves you still  madam  but you have declared you will never be his  he is still free  these are the circumstances that nourish my hope  My heart is in your hand  I have made you mistress of my dearest secret  Can you forgive me  madam  But you have an heroic soul  Remember  Mrs Arnold  to your generosity I now trust what is dearer to me than life  Should Mr Faulkland know  should lady Bidulph know  how I have abused their confidence  I think I could not outlive it   They never shall  madam  said I  I thank you for this frank acknowlegement of your heart  such a proof of your confidence in me  I should be a wretch to abuse  and I hope to make such a use of the candid confession you have now made me  as will greatly promote your interest   And is it possible  madam  said she  you can yield up the interest you have in Mr Faulkland without a pang  Oh  the exquisite charmer  and she said it with such an emphasis  drawing out her breath in long sighs  But you are heroic  as I said before  Nature did not mold your heart  as she has done those of the rest of your sex  Who that was beloved by Mr Faulkland  would yield him to another  Worlds  ten thousand worlds would I give to be beloved by him as you are  but you are a prodigy of a woman  I stopped Miss Burchell in her transports  There is less merit  madam  than you ascribe to me in my conduct  I readily acquiesced under my mother’s rejection of Mr Faulkland  when he had some interest in my heart  but there is no self denial in what I am now about to do for you  My affections have long since changed their object  and now lie buried with him in his grave   My tears here bore witness to the truth of what I said  Miss Burchell wept too  Her mind was agitated  the confession she had made to me had humbled her  her heart overflowed with fondness  I had filled her with pleasing hopes  all these sensations combined    together  melting her into tenderness  she is made up of tears  and sighs  and romantic wishes   I can now  said I  assure Mr Faulkland  that you have done him justice  and that he is highly obliged to your candour   She interrupted me  But  madam  if he should know how late my acknowlegements came—He need not know it  said I  my mother shall not know it either  leave every thing to my management  and depend upon my word  She snatched my hand eagerly  and kissed it   But oh  madam  above all things  said she  let not Sir George Bidulph know any thing of your intended goodness  in mediating for me  He hates me  implacably he hates me  I upbraid him not for it  his strong attachment to Mr Faulkland is the cause of it  he accuses me in his heart of being the occasion  which I own I was  though ignorantly  of Mr Faulkland’s disappointment  I am sure  were he to know what you design in my favour  he would counterwork you  and use all his influence over his friend to ruin me   I made her easy on this head  by assuring her Sir George should know nothing of the matter  and put her in mind how lucky it was for her that he was absent   I cannot
