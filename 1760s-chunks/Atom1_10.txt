and though his beard was not black  but rather of a subfuscan hue  he managed it with such dexterity  that Fika kaka declared the salute gave him unspeakable pleasure  while the bystanders protested that the contact produced  not simply electrical sparks or scintillations  but even a perfect irradiation  which seemed altogether supernatural  From this moment  Stiphi rum poo was initiated in the mysteries of the cabinet  and even introduced to the person of the Dairo Got hama baba  whose pedestrian favours    50 he shared with his new patron  It was observed  however  that even after his promotion and nobilitation  he still retained his original aukwardness  and never could acquire that graceful ease of attitude with which the Cuboy presented his parts averse to the contemplation of his sovereign  Indeed this minister s body was so well moulded for the celebration of the rite  that one would have imagined nature had formed him expressly for that purpose  with his head and body projecting forwards  so as to form an angle of forty five with the horizon  while the glutaei muscles swelled backwards as if ambitious to meet half way the imperial encounter   The third connexion that strengthened this political band was Nin kom poo po  commander of the Fune  or navy of Japan  who  if ever man was  might surely be termed the child of fortune  He was bred    51 to the sea from his infancy  and  in the course of pacific service  rose to the command of a jonkh  when he was so lucky as to detect a crew of pyrates employed on a desolate shore in concealing a hoard of money which they had taken from the merchants of Corea  Nin kom poo po  falling in with them at night  attacked them unawares  and having obtained an easy victory  carried off the treasure  I cannot help being amused at the folly of you silly mortals  when I recollect the transports of the people at the return of this fortunate officer  with a paultry mass of silver parading in covered waggons escorted by his crew in arms  The whole city of Meaco resounded with acclamation  and Nin kom poo po was extolled as the greatest hero that ever the empire of Japan produced  The Cuboy honoured him with five kisses in public  accepted of the osculation in private  recommended him in the strongest    52 terms to the Dairo  who promoted him to the rank of Sey seo gun  or general at sea  He professed himself an adherent to the Cuboy  entered into a strict alliance with Stiphi rum poo  and the whole management of the Fune was consigned into his hands  With respect to his understanding  it was just sufficient to comprehend the duties of a common mariner  and to follow the ordinary route of the most sordid avarice  As to his heart  he might be said to be in a state of total apathy  without principle or passion  for I cannot afford the name of passion to such a vile appetite as an insatiable thirst of lucre  He was  indeed  so cold and forbidding  that  in Japan  the people distinguished him by a nick name equivalent to the English word Salamander  not that he was inclined to live in fire  but that the coldness of his heart would have extinguished any fire it had approached     53 Some individuals imagined he had been begot upon a mermaid by a sailor of Kamschatka  but this was a mere fable —I can assure you  however  that when his lips were in contact with the Cuboy s posteriors  Fika kaka s teeth were seen to chatter  The pride of this animal was equal to his frigidity  He affected to establish new regulations at the council where he presided  he treated his equals with insolence  and his superiors with contempt  Other people generally rejoice in obliging their fellow creatures  when they can do it without prejudice to their own interest  Nin kom poo po had a repulsive power in his disposition  and seemed to take pleasure in denying a request  When this vain creature  selfish  inelegant  arrogant  and uncouth  appeared in all his trappings at the Dairo s court  upon a festival  he might have been justly compared to a Lapland idol of ice  adornedw th    54 a profusion of brass leaf and trinkets of pewter  In the direction of the Fune  he was provided with a certain number of assessors  counsellors  or co adjutors  but these he never consulted  more than if they had been wooden images  He distributed his commands among his own dependants  and left all the forms of the office to the care of the scribe  who thus became so necessary  that his influence sometimes had well nigh interfered with that of the president  nay  they have been seen  like the electrical spheres of two bodies  repelling each other  Hence it was observed  that the office of the Seyseo gun sialty resembled the serpent called Amphisbaena  which  contrary to the formation of other animals in head and tail  has a head where the tail should be  Well  indeed  might they compare them to a serpent  in creeping  cunning  coldness  and venom  but the comparison would    55 have held with more propriety  had
