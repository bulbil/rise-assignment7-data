and  of course  talk an infinite deal of Nonsense  but sure you will excuse me  when I solemnly declare  I have no Idea of Happiness  either in this World or the next  unshared by thee   The second Thing I have to mention is  my Surprize at your being able to live so long alone   for  in Unequals  what Society   And sure you appear to me like Adam  before   the last and best of all God s Works  was formed  dignified with  and conscious of that Superiority he felt  amidst his vassal Brutes  Yet could Equality alone render Society agreeable to you  you must  indeed  condemn yourself to a perpetual Solitude  for  in that Case  I know not where it would be possible for you to find a Companion     I am but just come home from Lady — s  My Watch lies on the Table  and points to Twelve  so I must bid you a thousand Times Good Night   Frances   Page  6  LETTER CLXXXII  HENRY to FRANCES   Elton   I AM come so far on my Way to London  and shall be able to receive just one Letter from you  before I leave it  My Uncle is in the Gout  which will not mend his Temper  and the three Women  I left behind me  are in a hopeful Way with him  and he  of consequence  extremely unhappy with them  for Providence has ordered it s eternal Laws so equitably  that whoever makes another unhappy  by Perverseness of Temper  makes himself no less so  I have more Indulgence for great Vices  than for this peevish  unsociable Humour  which Men absurdly contract at that Stage of Life  when they stand most in need of all the friendly  amusing  and social Helps  to aid them through  The other Vices have Nature on their Side  or Allurements and Temptations  to excuse them  but Moroseness is contrary to Nature   who diffuses Chearfulness among all her Works  and is also a Self torment in the very Exercise  As I have often said  I look d upon Chearfulness to be an Hymn to Providence  as well as a strong Indication of a virtuous Mind  so  I am almost bold to affirm  that Ill humour is Blasphemy in the Act  and a moral Vice in the Disposition  Page  7 Nay  to prove it a Vice  by the strict Rules of Logic  I affirm it to be a Thing diametrically opposite to the Nature of Virtue  for  as that is it s own Reward  this is it s own Punishment   It is observed by Addison  that few People have all the Qualities requisite to render Life agreeable  But there are two indispensably necessary  which are in every one s Power  Chearfulness and Constancy  Now he who wants either of these  should be condemned  while those  who fall short in the Gifts of Nature  ought only to be pitied  Here it may be proper to say something in my own Defence  who seem to labour under this Rule  in some People s Opinion  but observe  that there may be Chearfulness without Mirth  and Constancy with Professing   I am   my dearest Pet   Your s sincerely  Henry   LETTER CLXXXIII  HENRY to FRANCES   IT may seem idle to write you a Letter now  which you will get but a few Hours before I see you  but I do it  perhaps  to shew you  I have not so paltry a Consideration for you  as Page  8 the saving you a Groat  though I am sure  as I have no Letter of your s to answer  that I shall not be able to say any thing which can defray the Expence   Our Assizes ended this Day  by the Execution of all the Condemned  among whom was Johnson  a Rogue of some Consequence  When I heard the Guards coming down the Street  I retired to a back Room  as it is not a Spectacle I care to look on  but  considering it as an Object which might give Occasion to some useful Reflections  I returned  and saw them pass by  The first Thought which occurred to me was  that I should be glad to have been  for some Time  in their Situation  out of Curiosity  to know how a Man feels  or imagines  in such shocking Circumstances  for the mere Description of any thing does not sufficiently satisfy me  I should be also glad  more particularly  to know how I should behave myself  upon such an Occasion  whether I should feel myself most concerned for my Crime  or shocked at the Punishment  whether my Hopes  through the Merit of Repentance  would be sufficient to support me through the Terrors  if the Shame  or Pain  would afflict me most  whether I should act like a Madman  or a Fool  and  lastly  whether I could have Strength of Mind sufficient to support that calm and philosophic Temper at my Death  which great Part of my Life has Page  9 been laid out in endeavouring to attain  With regard to the Wretches themselves
