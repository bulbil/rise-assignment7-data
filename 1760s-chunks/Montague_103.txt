five and twenty       He desired me to tell you  all his interest should be employed for Fitzgerald  and that he wished you to come to England as soon as possible       We are just setting off for Temple s house in Rutland       Adieu   Your affectionate  ED  RIVERS     LETTER CLXVIII   168   To Captain FERMOR  at Silleri   Temple house  Aug  4   I ENJOY  my dear friend  in one of the pleasantest houses  and most agreable situations imaginable  the society of the four persons in the world most dear to me  I am in all respects as much at home as if master of the family  without the cares attending that station  my wishes  my desires  are prevented by Temple s attention and friendship  and my mother and sister s amiable anxiety to oblige me  I find an unspeakable softness in seeing my lovely Emily every moment  in seeing her adored by my family  in seeing her without restraint  in being in the same house  in living in that easy converse which is born from friendship alone  yet I am not happy       It is that we lose the present happiness in the pursuit of greater  I look forward with impatience to that moment which will make Emily mine  and the difficulties  which I see on every side arising  embitter hours which would otherwise be exquisitely happy       The narrowness of my fortune  which I see in a much stronger light in this land of luxury  and the apparent impossibility of placing the most charming of women in the station my heart wishes  give me anxieties which my reason cannot conquer       I cannot live without her  I flatter myself our union is in some degree necessary to her happiness  yet I dread bringing her into distresses  which I am doubly obliged to protect her from  because she would with transport meet them all  from tenderness to me       I have nothing which I can call my own  but my half pay  and four thousand pounds  I have lived amongst the first company in England  all my connexions have been rather suited to my birth than fortune  My mother presses me to resume my estate  and let her live with us alternately  but against this I am firmly determined  she shall have her own house  and never change her manner of living       Temple would share his estate with me  if I would allow him  but I am too fond of independence to accept favors of this kind even from him       I have formed a thousand schemes  and as often found them abortive  I go to morrow to see our little estate  with my mother  it is a private party of our own  and nobody is in the secret  I will there talk over every thing with her       My mind is at present in a state of confusion not to be expressed  I must determine on something  it is improper Emily should continue long with my sister in her present situation  yet I cannot live without seeing her        I have never asked about Emily s fortune  but I know it is a small one  perhaps two thousand pounds  I am pretty certain  not more       We can live on little  but we must live in some degree on a genteel footing  I cannot let Emily  who refused a coach and six for me  pay visits on foot  I will be content with a post chaise  but cannot with less  I have a little  a very little pride  for my Emily       I wish it were possible to prevail on my mother to return with us to Canada  I could then reconcile my duty and happiness  which at present seem almost incompatible       Emily appears perfectly happy  and to look no further than to the situation in which we now are  she seems content with being my friend only  without thinking of a nearer connexion  I am rather piqued at a composure which has the air of indifference  why should not her impatience equal mine       The coach is at the door  and my mother waits for me       Every happiness attend my friend  and all connected with him  in which number I hope I may  by this time  include Fitzgerald       Adieu   Your affectionate  ED  RIVERS     LETTER CLXIX   169   To Captain FERMOR  at Silleri   Aug  6   I HAVE been taking an exact survey of the house and estate with my mother  in order to determine on some future plan of life        Tis inconceivable what I felt on returning to a place so dear to me  and which I had not seen for many years  I ran hastily from one room to another  I traversed the garden with inexpressible eagerness  my eye devoured every object  there was not a tree  not a bush  which did not revive some pleasing  some soft idea       I felt  to borrow a very pathetic expression of Thomson s     A thousand little tendernesses throb
