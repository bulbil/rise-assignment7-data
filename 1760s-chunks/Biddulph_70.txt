George is with me  and desires to be remembered to you  he purposes staying here the greatest part of the winter   As I hope to reach London by the latter end of the week  direct your next to me at your own house in town   I am  My dear love  Your most sincerely  affectionate mother   Dorothy Bidulph   My heart is bursting—O Cecilia  What will become of my fond  my dear  venerable parent  when she finds this daughter  this comfort of her age  this beloved of her soul  a poor abandoned outcast  lost to her husband’s love  turned out of his doors  despised  disgraced  My children too—I must leave them behind—My God  for what calamities hast thou ordained thy creature  Tears  tears  you may well flow   So  I am relieved  and will endeavour to fortify my soul against the two events  that appear to me horrid as an approaching execution to a guilty wretch  the parting with my children  and the meeting with my mother  As the letter I wrote will miss of her at Sidney castle  I shall write to London  to prepare her to receive the wretch whom her imagination has figured to her so happy   Lady V—  I hear her coming up stairs—I cannot conceal my    affliction  nor my disgrace   Lady V—— has left me  left me in astonishment and new horror  Mrs Gerrarde  Who do you think Mrs Gerrarde is  She is the aunt of Miss Burchell  that aunt who betrayed her to destruction  Sure this woman was sent into the world for a scourge   I cannot collect myself to tell you with any method  the conversation that passed between lady V—— and me  She found me with the marks of tears on my face  they streamed again at the sight of her  I could not conceal the cause  and I put Mr Arnold’s letter into her hands  for I was not able to tell her the purport of it   This is Mrs Gerrarde’s doing  said she  the detestable creature  How could she work on your infatuated husband  to drive him such horrid lengths  I know not  said I  but I hope my lady V—— believes me innocent  Innocent  she exclaimed  My dear creature  your sufferings almost make me mad  Do you know that Mrs Gerrarde has an intrigue with your husband  I fear so  madam  I replied  but I hoped it was not publick  Poor child  said lady V——  his attachment to her has been no secret  ever since he came down to this country  though probably you were the last to suspect it  I have often dreaded the consequences of it  but never imagined it would have come to this  I always had a bad opinion of the woman  and only kept up a face of civility to her in her husband’s time  on account of her niece  a charming girl that then lived with her  but since Miss Burchell has left her  I have almost dropt my acquaintance with her  though my lord  who had an old friendship for captain Gerrarde  persuades me to be civil to her   The name of Miss Burchell had struck me speechless  The clue was now unravelled  With what an unremitting zeal has this base woman gone on in her career of iniquity  Lady V——  who was intirely taken up with the thoughts of my unhappiness  took no notice of my silence or confusion  What do you mean to do  my dear Mrs Arnold  said she  Do you think it is not possible  by the interposition of friends  to disabuse your unfortunate husband  For unfortunate he is  in a higher degree than yourself  as you have conscious innocence to support you  Oh madam  said I  it is in vain to think of it  Mrs Gerrarde has struck the blow effectually  Were Mr Arnold left to the workings of his own heart  he might  perhaps  relent  but that woman  like my evil genius and his  will take care to keep his suspicions alive  She possesses his whole heart  and my removal is become necessary  to the quiet of them both  I have taken this resolution  I will    immediately quit this house  and leave it to a righteous God to vindicate me in his own time  You should go no where but to my house  said lady V——  with tears in her eyes  but that I think it an improper situation for you  while Mr Faulkland is my guest  He will be distracted when he hears of this  I conjured lady V—— not to tell him  my being parted from my husband cannot long be a secret  said I  but the cause may  Lady V—— told me that Mr Faulkland was that very morning set out for Sidney castle  to see my brother  having received a letter from him the day before  in which he told him that my mother was going in a day or two to London  and begged he would come and spend a week with him  She added  that Mr Faulkland purposed doing so  and then to return to V—— hall  as my lord had obtained a promise
