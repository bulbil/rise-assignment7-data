I was utterly ignorant of both  and so incens d at Cringer s usage  that I would never set my foot within his door again —After a good deal more conversation  my new acquaintance and I parted  having made an appointment to meet next day at the same place  in order to set out for the city —I went immediately to Strap  and related every thing which had happen d  but he did not at all approve of my being so forward to lend money to a stranger  especially as we had been already so much impos d upon by appearances    However   said he  if you are sure he is a Scotchman  I believe you are safe        122  CHAP  XVI   My new acquaintance breaks an appointment—I proceed  by myself  to the Navy Office—address myself to a Person there  who assists me with his advice—I write to the board—they grant me a letter to the Surgeons at the Hall—I am inform d of the beau s name and character—I find him—he makes me his confident in an amour—desires me to pawn my linen  for his occasions—I recover what I lent him—some curious observations of Strap on that occasion—his vanity   IN the morning I got up and went to the place of rendezvous  where I waited two hours in vain  and was so exasperated against him for breaking his appointment  that I set out for the city by myself  in hopes of finding the villain  and being reveng d on him for his perfidy —At length I found myself at the Navy Office  which I entered  and saw crowds of young fellows walking below  many of whom made no better appearance than myself—I consulted the physiognomy of each  and at last made up to one whose countenance I lik d  and ask d  if he could instruct me in the form of the letter which was to be sent to the board  to obtain an order for examination  He answered me in broad Scotch  that he would shew me the copy of what he had wrote for himself    123 by the direction of another who knew the form  And accordingly pulled it out of his pocket for my perusal  and told me  that if I was expeditious  I might send it in to the board before dinner  for they did no business in the afternoon  He then went with me to a coffee house hard by  where I wrote the letter  which was immediately delivered to the messenger  who told me  I might expect an order to morrow about the same time —Having transacted this piece of business  my mind was a good deal compos d  and as I had met with so much civility from this stranger  I desired further acquaintance with him  fully resolved however  not to be deceived by him so much to my prejudice as I had been by the beau—He agreed to dine with me at the cook s shop which I frequented  and on our way thither  carried me to  Change  where I was in some hopes of finding Mr  Jackson  for that was the name of the person who had broke his appointment —I sought him there to no purpose  and on our way to the other end of the town  imparted to my companion his behaviour towards me  Upon which  he gave me to understand  that he was no stranger to the name of beau Jack son  so he was called at the Navy Office  altho  he did not know him personally  that he had the character of a good natur d careless fellow  who made no scruple of borrowing from any body that would lend  that most people who knew him  believed he had a good enough principle at the bottom  but his extravagance was such  he would probably never have it in his power to manifest the honesty of his intention —This account made me sweat for my five shillings  which I nevertheless did not altogether despair of recovering  provided   124 I could find out the debtor —This young man likewise added another circumstance of  Squire Jackson s history  which was  that being destitute of all means to equip him for sea  when he receiv d his last warrant  he had been recommended to a person who lent him a little money  after he had signed a will and power  entitling that person to lift his wages when they should become due  as also to inherit his effects in case of his death —That he was still under the tutorage and direction of that gentleman  who advanced him small sums from time to time upon this security  at the rate of 50 per cent  But at present his credit was very low  because his funds would do little more than pay what he had already receiv d  this moderate interest included —After the stranger  whose name was Thomson  had entertain d me with this account of Jackson  he inform d me  that he himself had passed for a third mate of a third rate  about four months ago  since which time  he had constantly attended at the Navy Office  in hopes of a warrant  having been assur d from the beginning  both by a Scotch member and one of the commissioners to whom the member recommended him  that he should be put into
