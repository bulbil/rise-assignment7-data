it  It was perpetrated but the day before      When any severity was to be exercised upon the unhappy Lady  Laura was always shut out of her apartment  Her Lady had said something that she was to be chidden for  Lady Sforza  who was not altogether so severe as her daughter  was not at home  Laura listned in tears  She heard Laurana in great wrath with Lady Clementina  and threaten her—and her young Lady break out to this effect—What have I done to you  Laurana  to be so used —You are not the cousin Laurana you used to be  You know I am not able to help myself  Why do you call me crazy  and frantic Laurana   Vile upbraider  Lucy   If the Almighty has laid his upon me  should I not be pitied —       It is all for your good  It is all for your good  Clementina  You could not always have spoken so sensibly  cousin        Cruel Laurana  You loved me once  I have no Mother  as you have  My Mother was a good Mother  But she is gone  Or I am gone  I know not which        She threatned her then with the Strait Waistcoat  a punishment which the unhappy Lady was always greatly terrified at  Laura heard her beg and pray  but  Laurana coming out  she was forced to retire        The poor young Lady apprehending her cruel cousin s return with the threatned waistcoat  and with the woman that used to be brought in when they were disposed to terrify her  went down and   58 hid herself uuder a stair case  where she was soon discovered by her cloaths  which she had not been careful to draw in after her      O  Lucy  how I wept  How insupportable to me  said Sir Charles  would have been my reflexions  had my conscience told me  that I had been the wilful cause of the noble Clementina s calamity   After I had a little recovered  I read to myself the next paragraph  which related     That the cruel Laurana dragged the sweet sufferer by her gown  from her hiding place  inveighing against her  threatning her  She  all patient  resigned  her hands crossed on her bosom  praying for mercy  not by speech  but by her eyes  which however wept not  And causing her to be carried up to her chamber  there punished her with the Strait Waistcoat as she had threatned       Father Marescotti was greatly affected with Laura s relation  as well as with what he had himself observed  But on his return to Bologna  dreading to acquaint her Mother  for her own sake  with the treatment her Clementina met with  he only said  he did not quite approve of it  and advised her not to oppose the young Lady s being brought home  if the Bishop and the General came into it  But he laid the whole matter before the Bishop  who wrote to the General to join with him out of hand  to release their sister from her present bondage  And the General meeting the Bishop on a set day at Milan  for that purpose  the Lady was accordingly released        A breach ensued upon it  with Lady Sforza and her daughter  who would have it  that Clementina was much better for their management  They had by terror broke her spirit  and her passiveness was reckoned upon as an indication of amendment        The Marchioness being much indisposed  the young Lady attended by her Camilla  was carried to Naples  where it is supposed she now is  Poor young Lady  how has she been hurried about —   59 But who can think of her cousin Laurana without extreme indignation        Mrs  Beaumont writes  that the Bishop would fain have prevailed upon his brother  the General  to join with him in an invitation to Sir Charles Grandison to come over  as a last expedient  before they locked her up either in a Nunnery  or in some private house  but the General would by no means come into it        He asked  What was proposed to be the end of Sir Charles s visit  were all that was wished from it to follow  in his sisters restored mind —He never  he said  would give his consent that she should be the wife of an English protestant        The Bishop declared  that he was far from wishing her to be so  But he was for leaving that to after consideration  Could they but restore his sister to her reason  that reason  co operating with her principles  might answer all their hopes        He might try his expedient  the General said  with all his heart  But he looked upon the Chevalier Grandison to be a man of art  and he was sure he must have entangled his sister by methods imperceptible to her  and to them  but yet more efficacious
