bearded   dada loved him better than all the world  so Harry loved him   better than three worlds   for he was ever desirous of going three   times as far  in affection and good offices  as any one went for him      At length he obtained consent  and was conducted by his nurse    in all his finery  on a visit to his dear dada      Their meeting was accompanied by tears of joy on both sides     when the old gentleman  struck with concern at the garb in which   he saw his darling  cried out And who  rny clear  put this fool s   coat upon my child   Fool s coat  sir   says Harry  Yes  my love    it is worse than all that  they were very naughty doctors who   have endeavoured to poison my boy  There is not a bit of all this   lace and ruffling that is not full of rank poisons  I will tell you   a story  my Harry      There was once upon a time  a very good and very clever boy   called Hercules  As he grew up  besides his prayers and his book    he was taught to run and leap   to ride  wrestle  and cudgel   and    though he was able to beat all the boys in the parish  he never   used to hurt or quarrel with any of them  He did not matter   cold  nor hunger  nor what he eat  nor what he drank   nor how          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  21     nor where he lay   and he went always dressed in the skin of a   wil 1 beast  that could bear all winds and weathers  and that he   could put on or off at pleasure   for he knew that his dress was no   part of himself  and could neither add to him nor take away any   thing from him      When this brave boy came to man s estate  he went about the   world doing good in all places   helping the weak  and feeding the   hungry  and clothing the naked  and comforting those that cried    and beating all those who did hurt or wrong to others  and all   good people loved him with their whole heart  and all naughty   people feared him terribly      But  O sad and dismal   A lady whom he had saved from great   hurt and shame  made him a present of a new coat  which was   called a shirt in those days  as they wore it next the skin  And   now  my Harry  take notice  The lady had covered his coat all   over with laces  and with rufflings  and with beads of glass  and   such other fooleries   so that poor Hercules looked just as fine as   you do now  And he turned him to this side  and he turned him   to that side  and he began to think more and better of himself    because he had got this fool s coat upon him  And the poison of   it entered into his body and into his mind  and brought weakness   and distempers upon the one and the other  And he grew so fond   of it  that he could not bear to have it put off   for he thought that    to part with it  would be to part with his flesh from the bones    Neither would he venture out in the rain any more   nor box nor   wrestle with any body  for fear of spoiling his fine coat  So that   in time he lost the love and the praises of every body  and all   people scorned him  and pointed at him for a fool and a coxcomb   as he went by      For some time after the old gentleman had finished his story    the child continued to gaze up at him  with fixed eyes and open   mouth  as fearful of losing any syllable that he might utter   till    recollecting himself  he cried out  O  this is a very sad case  indeed     I wish my coat  vas burnt  so I do   but don t fear for me  dada    Why  how then  Harry   replied his patron  Why  I may find a   trick for all this  dada   I warrant you never see me in this ugly   coat again      After this  and some other instructions and mutual endearments    nurse pressed to be gone   and these two fond friends were com    pelled to sunder  with a promise on Harry s part of a speedy   return
