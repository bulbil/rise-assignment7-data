the manner in which it is generally studied  where the memory is loaded with little more than dates  names  and events  Simply to repeat the transaction is thought sufficient for every purpose  and the youth  who is applauded for his readiness in this way  fancies himself a perfect historian  But the true use of history does not consist in being able to settle a genealogy  in knowing the events of an obscure reign  or the true epoch of a contested birth  this knowledge of facts hardly deserves the name of science  true wisdom consists in tracing effects from their causes  To understand history is to understand man  who is the subject  To study history is to weigh the motives  the opinions  the passions of mankind  in order to avoid a similitude of error in ourselves  or profit by the wisdom of their example   To study history in this manner may be begun at any age  Children can never be too soon treated as men  Those masters  who alledge the incapacity of tender youth  only tacitly reproach their own  these who are incapable of teaching young minds to reason  pretend that it is impossible  The truth is  they are fonder of making their pupils talk well than think well  and much the greater   4 number are better qualified to give praise to a ready memory than a sound judgment  The generality of mankind consider a multitude of facts as the real food of the mind  not as subjects proper to afford it exercise  From hence it proceeds  that history  instead of teaching us to know ourselves  often only serves to raise our vanity  by the applause of the ignorant  or  what is more dangerous  by the self delusion of untried vanity   Assuming ignorance is  of all situations  the most ridiculous  for  in the same proportion as the real man of wisdom is preferable to the unlettered rustic  so much is the rustic superior to him  who without learning imagines himself learned  Better that such a man had never read  for then he might be conscious of his weakness  but the half learned man  relying upon his strength  seldom perceives his wants till he finds his deception past a cure   Your labours in history have hitherto been rather confined to the words  than the facts  of your historical guides  You have read Xenophon or Livy  rather with a view of learning the dead languages in which they are written  than of profiting by the instructions which they afford  the time is now come to discontinue the study of words for things  for exercising your judgment  and giving more room to reason than the fancy   Above all things  I would advise you to consult the original historians in every relation  Abridgers  compilers  commentators  and critics  are in general only fit to fill the mind with unnecessary anecdotes  or lead its researches astray  In the immensity of various relations  your care must be to select such as deserve to be known  because they serve to instruct  the end of your labour should   5 not be to know in what year fools or savages committed their extravagances  but by what methods they emerged from barbarity  The same necessity there is for knowing the actions of the worthy part of princes  also compels us to endeavour to forget those of the ignorant and vulgar herd of kings  who seemed only to slumber in a seat they were accidentally called to fill  In short  not the history of kings  but of man  should be your principal concern  and such an history is only to be acquired by consulting those originals who painted the times they lived in  Their successors  who pretended to methodize their histories  have almost universally deprived them of all their spirit  and given us rather a dry catalogue of names  than afforded an opportunity for improving reflexion   History  in general  is precious or insignificant  not from the brilliancy of the events  the singularity of the adventures  or the greatness of the personages concerned  but from the skill  penetration  and judgment of the observer  Tacitus frequently complains of his want of materials  of the littleness of his incidents  of the weakness and villainy of his actors  yet  even from such indifferent subjects  he has wrought out the most pleafing and the most instructive history that ever was written  it will therefore be entirely the work of your own judgment to convert the generality of historians to your benefit  they are  at present  but rude materials  and require a fine discernment to separate the useful from the unnecessary  and analyse their different principles   Yet  mistake me not  I would not have history to consist of dry speculations upon facts  told with phlegm  and pursued without interest and passion  nor would I have your reason fatigued continually   6 in critical research  all I require is  that the historian would give as much exercise to the judgement as the imagination  it is as much his duty to act the philosopher  or politician  in his narratives  as to collect materials for narration  Without a philosophical skill in discerning  his very narrative must be frequently false  fabulous  and contradictory  without political sagacity  his characters must be
