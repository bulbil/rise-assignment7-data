for such I affirm them to be  should not be suffered to   get away   and further  that they should be instantly searched    and all that is found about them reserved for the inspection of   yourselves and his lordship      My lord  said the foreman  I humbly conceive that no ill   consequence can ensue from searching and setting a watch over   those people  their testimony is already given  and cannot be   invalidated thereby      Well  added the judge  I would willingly hear what this fellow    this turncoat  has to say for himself      My lord  replied the youth  provided I approve my truth before   God  I shall be the less afflicted for having fallen under your lord    ship s displeasure  My name is Edward Longfield  I was born to   happier prospects  My father was a gentleman   and about eighteen   months ago I took the degree of bachelor at Queen s College in   Oxford  But misfortunes and misunderstandings happening in our   family  I was left to be the former of my own fortunes  and  arriving   at London  I was taken into service by my late Lord Stivers  He   grew fond of me beyond my merits   and I began to partake of his   friendship and confidence  at the time that I was deprived of the   most generous of masters by the most unhappy of all events      He then deposed to his lord having communicated to him his   designs against Mrs  Clement  and that  upon his daring to remon    strate with him on the illegality of his plans  Lord Stivers had   become angry  and threatened him with the loss of his favour for   ever  He then  continued Mr  Longfield  told me how he had   gained over her maid by a large bribe to his interest  I felt sad   and unwilling to participate in my lord s doings  but I was a de    pendant on his bounty  and really attached to him from many of his         104 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      very engaging qualities  We adjourned to Mrs  Clement s house on   some intimation from the confederate there   Lord Stivers went up    stairs  while we followed the maid  Mrs  Deborah  to the kitchen      I soon observed that my companion  Mr  Robert there  was intent   on making up his acquaintance with Mrs  Deborah   and  as I found   myself extremely uneasy  I gave them the slip without being   observed  and  stealing up stairs  I put my ear to the door where I   heard the voice of my master  Blessed heaven   to what surpassing   sentiments was I then an amazed witness   to what proofs of an   innocence of the most exalted nature   If I should not be tedious I   would deliver to the court to you  my lord  in particular and to   you  gentlemen of the jury  the best account I can of those wonder    ful passages      Hear him hear him hear him   was then almost the universal   cry  till he was permitted by the bench  and desired by the jury    to speak with freedom      He then repeated  in a more ample and pathetic manner  all that   passed  as I have told you  between Lord Stivers and my wife  But   stopping  as he drew near to the fatal catastrophe I could no   longer bear  he said  the piercing cries  the agonizing shrieks of one   in such extremity  Had I any kind of weapon I thought I should   have done my lord good service by preventing his wickedness  But   I trembled and grew exceeding sick  and hastening down to the   kitchen  I threw myself into a chair  and swooned away      While I was in my fit  and Robert and Deborah were busy about   me  the fatal stroke  as I imagine  was given  and the prisoner made   her escape with her infant in her arms  When I was somewhat   recovered  and had taken a dram of Mrs  Deborah s bottle  she put   down the kettle  and invited us to a dish of tea  I requested my   companions  from tune to time  to step out and listen   but they   reported that all was quiet above stairs      At length it grew darkish  and being all of us surprised that no   candles were called for  we went in a body up stairs  and Deborah   ventured gently to tap at the door  but hearing no voice nor   stirring in the chamber  she turned the bolt softly
