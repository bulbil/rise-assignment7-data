me to perfection  Nothing could exceed my profound respect for the goldsmith and his wife  or the transports of my passion at Gabriela s feet  while I smoothed my way into the graces of the family  by listening with impregnable patience to their witless repartees and irrational ratiocinations  Thus did I gain the great end of all my forbearance  the pleasure of pleasing my new relations  Every individual of the clan felt himself a foot taller for the honour of my alliance   The repast ended  the company moved into a large room  where we were entertained with a concert of vocal and instrumental music  not the worst that was ever heard  though the performers were not selected from the choicest bands at Madrid  Some lively airs put us in mind of dancing  Heaven knows what sort of performers we must have been  when they took me for the Coryphaeus of the opera  though I never had but two or three lessons from a petty dancing master  who taught the pages on the establishment of the Marchioness de Chaves  After we had tired our tendons  it was time to think of going home  There was no end of my bows and God  bless you s  Farewell  my dear son in law  said Salero as he squeezed my hand  I shall be at your house in the morning with the portion in ready money  You will be welcome  come when you list  my dear father in law  answered I  Afterwards  wishing the family good night  I jumped into my carriage  and ordered it to drive home   Scarcely had I got two hundred yards from Signor Gabriel s house  when fifteen or twenty men  some on foot and some on horseback  all with swords and fire arms  surrounded and stopped the coach  crying out  In the name of our sovereign lord the king  They dragged me out by main force  and thrust me into a hack chaise  when the leader of the party got in with me  and ordered the driver to go for Segovia  There could be no doubt but the honest gentle man by my side was an alguazil  I wanted to know something about the cause of my arrest  but he answered in the language of those gentry  which is very bad language  that he had other things to do than to satisfy my impertinent curiosity  I suggested that he might have mistaken his man  No  no  retorted he  the fool is wiser than that  You are Signor de Santillane  and in that case you are to go along with me  Not being able to deny that fact  it became an act of prudence to hold my tongue  For the remainder of the night we traversed Mancanarez in sulky silence  changed horses at Colmenar  and arrived the next evening at Segovia  where the lodging provided for me was in the tower       CH  IV     The treatment of Gil Blas in the tower of Segovia  The cause of his imprisonment   THEIR first favour was to clap me up in a cell  where they left me on the straw like a criminal  whose only earthly portion was to con over his dying speech in solitude  I passed the night  not in bewailing my fate  for it had not yet presented itself in all its aggravation  but in endeavouring to divine its cause  Doubtless it must have been Calderona s handiwork  And yet though his branching honours might have pressed thick upon his senses  I could not conceive how the Duke of Lerma could have been induced to treat me so inhumanly  Sometimes I apprehended my arrest to have been without his excellency s knowledge  at other times I thought him the contriver of it  for some political reasons  such as weigh with ministers when they sacrifice their accomplices at the shrine of state policy   My mind was vibrating to and fro with these various conjectures  when the dawn peeping in at my little grated window  presented to my sight all the horror of the place where I was confined  Then did I vent my sorrows without ceasing  and my eyes became two springs of tears  flowing inexhaustibly at the remembrance of my prosperous state  Pending this paroxysm of grief  a turnkey brought me my day s allowance of bread and water  He looked at me  and on the contemplation of my tear besprinkled visage  gaoler as he was  there came over him a sentiment of pity  Do not despair  said he  This life is full of crosses  but mind them not  You are young  after these days  you will live to see better  In the meantime  eat at the king s mess  with what appetite you may   My comforter withdrew with this quaint invitation  answered by my groans and tears  The rest of the day was spent in cursing my wayward destiny  without thinking of my empty stomach  As for the royal morsel  it seemed more like the message of wrath than the boon of benevolence  the tantalizing protraction of pain  rather than the solace of affliction   Night came  and with it the rattle of a key in my keyhole  My dungeon door opened  and in came a man with a wax light in his
