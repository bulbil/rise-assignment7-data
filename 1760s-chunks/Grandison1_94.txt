to drink a glass of the wine  But I had neither stomach nor will to touch either   He eat himself very cordia•ly God forgive me  I wished in my heart  there were pins and needles in every bit he put in his mouth   He drank two glasses of the wine  Again he urged me  I said  I hoped I had cat and drank my last   You have no dependence upon my honour  madam  said the villain  so cannot be disappointed mach  do what I will  Ungrateful  proud  vain  obstinate  he called me     231 What signifies  says he  shewing politeness to a woman who has shewn none to me  tho  she was civil to every other man  Ha  ha  ha  hah  What  my sweet Byron  I don t hit your fancy  You don▪t like my morals  Laughing again  My lovely fly  said the insulting wretch  hugging me round in the cloak▪ how prettily have I wrapped you about in my web —  Such a provoking  low wretch —I struggled to free myself  and unhooked the curtain of the fore glass  But he wrapt me about the closer  and said he would give me his garter for my girdle  if I would not sit still  and be orderly  Ah  my charming Byron  said he  your opportunity is over—All your struggles will not avail you—Will not avail you  That s a word of your own you know  I will  however  forgive you  if you promise to love me now  But if you stay till I get you to the allotted place  then  madam  take what follows   I saw that I was upon a large  wild  heath like place  between two roads  as it seemed  I asked nothing about my journey s end  All I had to hope for as to an escape  tho  then I began to despair of it  was upon the road  or in some town  My journey s end  I knew  must be the beginning of new dials  for I was resolved to suffer death  rather than to marry him  What I now was most apprehensi•e about  was  of failing into fits  and I answered to his barbarous insults as little as possible  that I might not be provoked beyond the little strength I had left me   Three or four times he offered to kiss me  and cursed my pride for resisting him  making him clasp a cloud  was his speech  aiming at wit  instead of his Juno  calling the cloak a cloud   And now  my dear Byron  said he  if you will not come to a compromise with me  I must dress you again for the journey  We will stop at a town a little further  beckoning to one of his men and on his approaching  whispering to him  his whole body out of   232 the chariot  and there you shall alight  and a very worthy woman  to whom I shall introduce you  will persuade you  perhaps to take refreshment  though I cannot   You are a very barbarous man  Sir Hargrave  I have the misfortune to be in your power  You may dearly repent the usage I have already received from you  You have made my life of no estimation with me  I will not contend   And tears ran down my cheeks  Indeed  I thought my heart was broke   He wrapt me up close  and tied the handkerchief about my mouth and head  I was quite passive   The chariot had not many minutes got into the great road again  over the like rough and sometimes plashy ground  when it stopt on a dispute be•ween the coachman  and the coachman of another chariot and six  as it proved   Sir Hargrave had but just drawn my handkerchief closer to my eyes  when this happened  Hinder not my tears from flowing  said I  struggling to keep my eyes free  the cloak enough muffling me  and the handkerchief being over my mouth  so that my voice could be but just heard by him  as I imagine   He looked out of his chariot  to see the occasion of this stop  and then I found means to disengage one hand   I heard a gentleman s voice directing his own coachman to give way   I then pushed up the handkerchief with my disengaged hand  from my mouth  and pulled it down from over my eyes  and cried out for help  Help for God s sake   A man▪s voice  it was my deliverer s  as it happily proved  bid Sir Hargrave s coachman proceed at his peril   Sir Hargrave  with terrible oaths and curses  ordered him to proceed  and to drive thro  all opposition     233 The gentleman called Sir Hargrave by his name  and charged him with being upon a bad design   The vile wretch said  he had only secur•d a runaway wife  eloped to  and intended to elope from  a masquerade  to her adultere••••or•d    He put aside the cloak  and appealed 〈◊◊〉 dress   I cried out  No
