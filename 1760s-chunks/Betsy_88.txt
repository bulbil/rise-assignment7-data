 and afterwards teazed by his raillery  and   then reprimanded on the score of her conduct by Mr  Goodman  she was not   displeased in her heart at the dangerous proof which the two lovers had   given her of their passion       She lost  however  great part of the satisfaction this adventure might   have afforded her  for want of a proper person to whom she might have   talked freely on it  She had  indeed  many acquaintances  in some of   whom she  doubtless  might have confided  but she did not chuse to be   herself the reporter of this story to any one who had not heard of it   from other hands  and Miss Flora  who knew the whole  and was her   companion and bedfellow  was grown of late so sullen and peevish  as not   to be capable of either giving or receiving any diversion in discourses   of that nature       It is certain  however  that there never was a more astonishing   alteration in the temper of any one person in so short a time  than in   that of Miss Flora  her once gay and sprightly behaviour  which  without   being a beauty  rendered her extremely agreeable  was now become all   dull and gloomy  Instead of being fond of a great deal of company  she   now rather chose to avoid than covet the society of any one  she said   but little  and  when she spoke  it was only to contradict whatever she   heard alledged by others  A heavy melancholy  mixed with an ill natured   frown  perpetually loured upon her brow  in fine  if she had been a   little older  she might have sat for the picture of Envy  Miss Betsy  by   being most with her  felt most the effects of her bad humour  but as she   thought she could easily account  the sweetness of her disposition made   her rather pity than resent the change       A young linen draper  of whom Lady Mellasin sometimes bought things  had   taken a great fancy to Miss Flora  and not doubting but she had a   fortune in some measure answerable to the appearance she made  got a   friend to intercede with Lady Mellasin  for leave to pay his respects to   her daughter  This being granted  he made several visits to the house    and was very well received by Miss Flora herself  as well as by those   who had the disposal of her  till  coming on the topick of fortune  Mr    Goodman plainly told him  that having many relations of his own to   provide for  the most he could spare to Miss Flora was five hundred   pounds  The draper s passion was very much damped on hearing his   mistress s portion was like to be so small  he told Mr  Goodman  that   though he was very much charmed with the person and behaviour of the   young lady  and should be proud of the honour of an alliance with such a   family  yet as he was a young man  and but lately set up for himself  he   wanted money to throw into trade  and could not think of marrying   without more than three times the sum offered  He added  that a young   lady of her birth  and bringing up  would expect to live as she had been   accustomed  which he could no way promise she should do  without a   fortune sufficient to defray the expence       Mr  Goodman thought the reasons he gave were very just  and as he was   unwilling to stretch his hand any farther than he had said  and was too   honest to promise more than he intended to perform  replied  with the   same freedom that the other had spoke  that in truth he did not think   Flora would make a fit wife for a tradesman  that the girl was young   enough  not ugly  and it was his opinion that she should wait till a   more suitable match should offer  In a word  Mr  Goodman s answer put a   final stop to the courtship  and though Miss Flora affected to disdain   the mercenary views  as she termed them  of the draper  and never spoke   of him but with the utmost contempt  yet her melancholy coming on soon   after he had desisted his addresses  made Miss Betsy think she had   reason to impute it to no other cause  and therefore  in mere compassion   to this imaginary mortification  was so far from retorting any of those   little taunts and malicious innuendoes  with which she was continually   treated by the other  that she took all the pains she could to alleviate   the vexation she saw her in  and soothe her into a better humour       The
