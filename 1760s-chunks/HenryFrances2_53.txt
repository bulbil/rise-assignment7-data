ourselves against Sickness  or the Invalid may find his Couch his Grave   I have brought a very severe Cold from —  which breaks in upon my Scheme of Solitude  as it confines me entirely within Doors  It has not yet made any Attack upon my Throat  which is all the Danger I ever apprehend from that Disorder   Adieu   my Life  my Love   LETTER CCLI   My dearest  sick Love   I AM particularly concerned at your Cough  for it is the worst Symptom of a Cold  and what your slight Constitution  inclined to an Hectic and Decay  is very little able to bear  My Love to the India Folk  because you say they have been very kind and affectionate to you   I am displeased at your saying  you are weary of Life  It is  at least  unkind  if not something Page  199 worse  It is the Sign of a Lowness of Spirits  and a Carelessness  which is much below your Sense  Virtue  or Religion  I cannot excuse any one for speaking without Thought  who is capable of thinking so well  It was said by one of the Antients    that a patient Resignation to necessary Evils was next to the Merit of a voluntary Martyrdom   This was a fine Saying in the Days of superstitious Enthusiasm  when Men officiously threw themselves in the Way of Persecution  in order to merit the eighth Beatitude  but  at present  the first Virtue  mentioned above  stands unrivalled  Let Men repine at what Misfortune they will  it will be found  upon Examination  that their Loss of Patience is the greatest Evil they labour under  The absurd Notion of natural Right to the good Things of this Life  occasions our Uneasiness at their Loss  but consider Matters philosophically or religiously  and all the Concern vanishes  We cannot challenge a Property in any Thing  from Providence  in this Life  for we were not in a Condition to make Terms for ourselves  before we came into it  but we should consider ourselves here  in an happy State of establishing an indefeasible Right to the highest Enjoyments of the next  Neither Health or Fortune we can call our own  where every Thing fluctuates incessantly  and  if our Furniture be Glass  why should we be surprized at it s being broken  Page  200 And it is as vain and ridiculous to grieve at any Loss of worldly Advantage  as it would be to be mortified  because  The very Air  you breathe this Day   The next may help an Ass to bray   Which is the only Distich  I remember  of a Poem  I wrote  some Years ago  upon this very Subject     Now observe  ma Seule  et chere Mignonne  that I am not scolding  but only philosophizing  which being premised  I shall go on with an Observation  I have made  long since  upon one of the Beatitudes  I forget which  in Order  but the Text is    Blessed are the Poor in Spirit    c  Here is  methinks  an Instance  among many  of the Difference between the Christian and Heathen Philosophy  which some Authors  vain of the natural Reason of Man  have affirmed to be the same  The latter teaches us Contempt for Riches  and Fortitude in Misfortunes  But the former inspires us with a Resignation to Poverty  and Patience under Sufferings  One but increases the savage Fierceness of Man s Nature into a Pride and Stoicism above it  The other softens us into a Spirit of Humility and Meekness  not below  but consonant to  the imperfect State of Man in this Life  While Men  either before  or during their Ignorance of  Revelation  considered themselves Page  201 only with Regard to this Life  perhaps the Heroism of Stoic Philosophy might sufficiently answer the Purposes of human Nature  in this confined View  But of what Use are Virtues  Sentiments  or Affections  cultivated here  which can never be exerted in that State  where there will be no Pomps fit to contemn  or Misfortunes to oblige us to suffer  while the Spirit of Meekness and Humility will sufficiently answer our Ends here  and is the proper Temper to prepare us for the Enjoyment of Love  and Contemplation  which are the Occupations of the Blest above     As your Cold has probably taken away what little Appetite you had  I shall send you up  by Thursday s Stage  a Crock of the finest pickled Walnuts  you ever saw or tasted  I wish I could send you some of my Mutton  as little  and as sweet   but somewhat fatter  as yourself  My Hams  however  will soon come  and I shall carry up some of them for you —Sweet  good Night —  Take Notice  that I always kiss my Letters going to you  as I do those I receive from you  and have just put my Lips to the Expression   the Blest above   thy sole Superiors   Henry   Page  202  LETTER CCLII  FRANCES to HENRY   My dearest Life   AMIDST the Noise and Impertinence  I
