of the best of men  all owing to his serving and saveing me   Surprizes from joy  I fancy  and where gratitude is the principal spring  are sooner recovered from  than surprizes which raise the more stormy passions  Mrs  Reeves came in to me  My dear  Your withdrawing will be noticed  I was just coming in  said I  And so I was  I went in   Sir Charles bowed low to me  So did my Lord  Permit me  madam  said Sir Charles  to present Lord L  to you  He is our brother—Our late found sister Harriet  my Lord   Yes  but  Sir Charles  said Miss Grandison  Miss Byron  and Mr  and Mrs  Reeves  have been tormenting themselves about a postscript to that footman s letter  You told not us of that postscript   Who minds postscripts  Charlotte  Except indeed to a Lady s Letter  One word wi•h you  good Miss Byron  taking my hand  and leading me to the window   How the fool colour d  I could feel my face glow   O Lucy  What a consciousness of inferiority fills a mind not ungenerous  when it labours under the sense of obligations it cannot return   My sister Charlotte  madam  was impatient to present to you her beloved sister  Lady L  was as impatient to   288 attend you  My Lord L  was equally desirous to claim the honour of your acquaintance  They insisted upon my introducing my Lord  I thought it was too precipitant a visit  and might hurt your delicacy  and make Charlotte and me appear  as if we had been ostentatiously boasting of the opportunities that had been thrown into our hands  to do a very common service  I think I see that you are hurt  Forgive me  madam  I will follow my own judgment another time  Only be assured of this  that your merits  and not the service  have drawn this visit upon you   I could not be displeased at this polite address  as it helped me to an excuse for behaving so like a fool  as he might think  since he knew not the cause   You are very obliging  Sir  My Lord and Lady L  do me great honour  Miss Grandison cannot do anything but what is agreeable to me  In such company  I am but a common person  But my gratitude will never let me look upon your seasonable protection as a common service  I am only anxious for the consequences to yourself  I should have no pretence to the gratitude I speak of  if I did not own  that the reported threatnings  and what Wilson writes by way of postscript  have given me disturbance  lest your safety should  on my account  be brought into hazard   Miss Byron speaks like herself  But whatever were to be the consequences  can you think  madam  that a man of any spirit could have acted otherwise than I did  Would I not have been glad  that any man would have done just the same thing  in favour of my sister Charlotte  Could I behave with greater moderation  I am pleased with myself on looking back  and that I am not always  There shall no consequences follow  that I am not forced upon in my own necessary defence   We spoke loud enough to be heard  And Miss Grandison  joining us  said  But pray  brother  tell us    289 if there be grounds to apprehend any thing from what the footman writes   You cannot imagine but Sir Hargrave would bluster and threaten  To lose such a prize  so near as he thought himself to carrying his point  must affect a man of his cast  But are Ladies to be troubled with words  Men of true courage do not threaten   Shall I beg one word with you  Sir Charles  said my cousin Reeves   They withdrew to the back parlour  and there Mr  Reeves  who had the Letter of that Bagenhall  shewed it to him   He read it—A very extraordinary Letter  said he  and gave it back to him—But pray  what says Miss Byron to it —Is she willing to take this step in consideration of my safety   You may believe  Sir Charles  she is greatly distressed   As a tender hearted woman  and as one who thinks already much too highly of what was done  she may be distressed  But does she hesitate a moment upon the part she ought to take  Does she not despise the writer and the writing —I thought Miss Byron—  He stopt  it seems  and spoke and looked warm  the first time  said Mr  Reeves  that I thought Sir Charles  on occasion  passionate   I wish  Lucy  that he had not stopt  I wish he had said what he thought Miss Byron  I own to you  that it would go to my heart  if I knew that Sir Charles Grandison thought me a mean creature   You must think  Sir Charles  that Miss Byron—  Pray  Mr  Reeves  forgive me for interrupting you  what steps have been taken upon
