Lady Mellasin   and her daughter both cried out at the same time   O Miss Betsy  how   unlucky this happens  What will you do with the captain now         We will take him with us to the concert   replied she   and  in my   opinion  nothing could have fallen out more fortunately  The captain has   appointed to visit me at five  Mr  Staple will doubtless be here about   that time  if not before  in order to usher us to the entertainment  so   that my tar cannot expect any answer from me to his letter  and   consequently I shall gain time        Though Mr  Goodman was far from approving this way of proceeding  yet he   could not forbear smiling  with the rest  at Miss Betsy s contrivance    and told her  it was a pity she was not a man  she would have made a   rare minister of state        Well  since it is so   said Lady Mellasin   I will have the honour of   complimenting the captain with the ticket Mr  Staple intended for me     Both Miss Flora and Miss Betsy pressed her ladyship to be of their   company  and Mr  Goodman likewise endeavoured to persuade her to go  but   she excused herself  saying   A concert was never among those   entertainments she took pleasure in   On which they left off speaking   any farther on it  but Miss Betsy was not at a loss in her own mind to   guess the true reason of her ladyship s refusal  and looked on it as a   confirmation of the truth of what Nanny had told her concerning the   diamond necklace       There seemed  notwithstanding  one difficulty still remaining for Miss   Betsy to get over  which was  the probability of Mr  Trueworth s making   her a visit that afternoon  she did not chuse to leave him to go to the   concert  nor yet to ask him to accompany them to it  because she thought   it would be easy for a man of his penetration to discover that Mr    Staple was his rival  which she was by no means willing he should do   before he had made a declaration to her of his own passion       She was beginning to consider how she should manage in a point which she   looked upon as pretty delicate  when a letter from that gentleman eased   her of all the apprehensions she at present had on this score  The   manner in which he expressed himself was as follows             To Miss Betsy Thoughtless            Madam            I remember   as what can be forgot in which you have the least        concern   that the first time I had the honour of seeing you at        Oxford  you seemed to take a great deal of pleasure in the pretty        tricks of a squirrel  which a lady in the company had on her arm         One of those animals  which  they tell me  has been lately catched         happening to fall in my way  I take the liberty of presenting him        to you  intreating you will permit him to give you such diversion        as is in his power  Were the little denizens of the woods endued        with any share of human reason  how happy would he think himself in        the loss of his liberty  and how hug those chains which entitle him        to so glorious a servitude            I had waited on you in person  in the hope of obtaining pardon for        approaching you with so trifling an offering  but am deprived of        that satisfaction by the pressing commands of an old aunt  who        insists on my passing this evening with her  But what need is there        to apologize for the absence of a person so little known to you         and whose sentiments are yet less so  I rather ought to fear that        the frequency of those visits I shall hereafter make  may be looked        upon as taking too presuming an advantage of the permission you        have been so good to give me  I will not  however  anticipate so        great a
