 Thus were the officers of the king of Sweden  the meanest of whom were   fit to be generals in any other army  subjected to the servile taunts    and insolent behaviour of wretches undeserving to be ranked among the   human species       A very little time had doubtless made them all find graves among these   barbarians  scarce a day passed over without their company decreasing by   two or three  who were no sooner dead than dragged out by the heels  and   thrown like dogs into a pit without the least funeral rites  But   providence at length thought fit to send them a relief by means they   least expected       In one of the incursions made by the Muscovites into Poland  a very   beautiful lady  whose father had been killed in asserting the cause of   Stanislaus  was made prisoner  prince Menzikoff  who commanded these   batallions  saw her  and became enamoured of her charms  she was   destitute of all friends  and in the conqueror s power  so thought it   best to yield what otherwise she found him determined to seize  in fine    she was his mistress  and her ready compliance with his desires    together with the love she either had or feigned to have for him    afterward gained her an absolute ascendant over him  Every one knows the   interest he had with the czar  and he so far exerted it  as to get this   fair favourite lodged in the palace  where she was served with the same   state and respect as if she had been his wife       This lady  whose name was Edella  happened to be walking with some of   her attendants near where these unfortunate gentlemen were buried  at a   time when three of them were dragged to their wretched sepulchre  was   touched with compassion to see any thing that had a human shape thus   coarsely treated  tho  after death  and had the curiosity to order one   of her people to enquire who those persons were  and what they had done    which hindered them from being allowed a christian burial       She was no sooner informed that they were Swedish prisoners  than her   soul shuddered at the thoughts of the Russian barbarity  and not   doubting but their usage during life had been of a piece with that after   their death  she resolved  if possible  to procure some abatement of the   miseries of those who yet survived       To this end she made it her business to examine what number of prisoners   had been brought  of what condition they were  and where lodged  and   being well acquainted with all she wanted to know  went to the governor   of Petersburg  and so well represented how dishonourable it was to the   czar  and how opposite to the law of nations  to treat prisoners of war   in a worse manner than they would do condemned felons  that he knowing   the power of prince Menzikoff  and fearing to disoblige one so dear to   him by a refusal  consented they should be removed into an upper part of   the prison where they would have more air  and also that they should   have an allowance of meat every day       As the governor was a true Muscovite in his nature and had an implacable   hatred to the king of Sweden and all that belonged to him  this was   gaining a great deal  but it was not enough to satisfy the charitable   disposition of Edella  after their removal  she went in person to visit   those of them whom she heard were gentlemen  and finding them covered   only with rags  which some of the soldiers had put on them after having   stripped them of their own rich habits  she ordered others lined with   furs to be made for them  to defend them from the coldness of the   season  and not content to retrench a great part of her own table  sold   several fine jewels  and other trinkets the prince had bestowed on her    to supply them with wine  and whatever necessaries she supposed them to   be accustomed to  That she might be certain those entrusted by her did   not abuse her good intentions  she went often to the prison herself to   see how they were served  and would sometimes enter into discourse with   them concerning the battles they had been in  the settlement of   Stanislaus  and many other things relating to the Polish affairs  The   gallant and courtly manner in which Horatio expressed himself on every   occasion  made her take a particular pleasure in hearing him speak  that   rough blunt behaviour to which she had been accustomed since her being   brought a captive into Muscovy  gave double charms to the politeness   with which she found herself entertained by our young
