the pleasure of   my rough natured governess  as I may call her  but now I can write to   ease my mind  though I can t send it to you  and write what I please    for she knows not how well I am provided  for good Mr  Longman gave me   above forty sheets of paper  and a dozen pens  and a little phial of   ink  which last I wrapped in paper  and put in my pocket  and some wax   and wafers       O dear sir  said I  you have set me up  How shall I requite you  He   said  By a kiss  my fair mistress  And I gave it very willingly  for he   is a good old man       Rachel and Hannah cried sadly  when I took my leave  and Jane  who   sometimes used to be a little crossish  and Cicely too  wept sadly  and   said  they would pray for me  but poor Jane  I doubt  will forget that    for she seldom says her prayers for herself  More s the pity       Then Arthur the gardener  our Robin the coachman  and Lincolnshire Robin   too  who was to carry me  were very civil  and both had tears in their   eyes  which I thought then very good natured in Lincolnshire Robin    because he knew but little of me   But since  I find he might well be   concerned  for he had then his instructions  it seems  and knew how he   was to be a means to entrap me       Then our other three footmen  Harry  Isaac  and Benjamin  and grooms    and helpers  were very much affected likewise  and the poor little   scullion boy  Tommy  was ready to run over for grief       They had got all together over night  expecting to be differently   employed in the morning  and they all begged to shake hands with me  and   I kissed the maidens  and prayed to God to bless them all  and thanked   them for all their love and kindness to me  and  indeed  I was forced to   leave them sooner than I would  because I could not stand it  Indeed   I could not  Harry  I could not have thought it  for he is a little   wildish  they say  cried till he sobbed again  John  poor honest John    was not then come back from you  But as for the butler  Mr  Jonathan  he   could not stay in company       I thought to have told you a deal about this  but I have worse things to   employ my thoughts       Mrs  Jervis  good Mrs  Jervis  cried all night long  and I comforted her   all I could  And she made me promise  that if my master went to London   to attend parliament  or to Lincolnshire  I would come and stay a week   with her  and she would have given me money  but I would not take it       Well  next morning came  and I wondered I saw nothing of poor honest   John  for I waited to take leave of him  and thank him for all his   civilities to me and to you  But I suppose he was sent farther by my   master  and so could not return  and I desired to be remembered to him       And when Mrs  Jervis told me  with a sad heart  the chariot was ready   with four horses to it  I was just upon sinking into the ground  though   I wanted to be with you       My master was above stairs  and never asked to see me  I was glad of it   in the main  but he knew  false heart as he is  that I was not to be   out of his reach   O preserve me  Heaven  from his power  and from his   wickedness       Well  they were not suffered to go with me one step  as I writ to you   before  for he stood at the window to see me go  And in the passage to   the gate  out of his sight  there they stood all of them  in two rows    and we could say nothing on both sides  but God bless you  and God bless   you  But Harry carried my own bundle  my third bundle  as I was used to   call it  to the coach  with some plumb cake  and diet bread  made for me   over night  and some sweet meats  and six bottles of Canary wine  which   Mrs  Jervis would make me take in
