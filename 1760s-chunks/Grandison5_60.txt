petulance of a brain sick girl   Hush  my Jeronymo  Let not the friend forget the brother  Clementina is the noblest of women  It is true  I was not prepared for this blow  But I reverence her for her greatness of mind—You have read her paper   I have  and am astonished at its contents   The Marquis  the Count  the Bishop  and Father Marescotti  entered  The Bishop embraced me  He disclaimed  in the name of every one  the knowlege of her intentions  He expected  he said  that she would have received my address with raptures of joy  But she must  she will  be yours  Chevalier  We are all engaged in honour to you  This is only a start of female delicacy  operating on a raised imagination  She leaves it to you  after all  to call her by what name you please   May it be so  But ah  my Lords  you see not the force of her arguments  With a Lady so zealous in her religion  and so justly fond of her relations and country  they must have weight—Instruct me  tell me  however  my Lords  Be pleased  madam  The Marchioness joined us just before  to advise me  what Page  150 to do—I am yours —I will withdraw  Consult together  and let me know what I am to be   I withdrew  and walked again into the garden   Camilla came to me  O Chevalier  What strange things are these  My Lady has taken a resolution she never will be able to support  She commanded me to find you out  and to watch your looks  your behaviour  your temper  She cannot live  she says  if you are displeased with her—I see that your mind is greatly disturbed  Must I report it so   Tell her  Camilla  that I am all resignation to her will  Disturbed as she has been  tell her  that her peace of mind is dear to me as my own life  That I can have no anger  no resentment  and that I admire her more than I can express   Camilla left me  Father Marescotti came to me presently after  with a request  that I would attend the family in Jeronymo s chamber   We went up together  All that the good Father said  as we walked in  was  that God knew what was best for us  For his part  he could only wonder and adore in silence   When we were all seated  the Bishop said  My dear Chevalier  you have intitled yourself to our utmost gratitude  It is confirmed  that Clementina shall be yours  Jeronymo will have it so  We are all of his mind  Her mother will enter into conversation with her in your favour   I am equally obliged and honoured by this goodness  But should she persist  what can I say  when she calls upon me in the most solemn manner  to support her in her resolution  and not to put her upon taking advantage of the generosity of her friends   She will be easily persuaded  no doubt  Chevalier  answered the Bishop  She loves you  Does she not say in this very paper     that it is in your power to Page  151 make her break or keep her resolution  and to add what name you please to her Christian name      Nor can I  said the Marquis  bear that flight  in Laurana s favour  If her mind were found  her duty would not permit her to think of it   It is our unanimous opinion  resumed the Bishop  that she will not be able to support her resolution  You see she is obliged to court your assistance  to enable her to keep it  Father Marescotti  it is true  has laid a stress upon some passages  in which she shews a doubt of her own strength  and dreads yours in a certain article nearest our hearts  But she must be cautioned to leave all arguments of that kind to her confessor and you  and to content herself to be an auditor  not an arguer  and we doubt not your honour  The marriage articles will bind you  as they shall us—And now allow me to be before hand with your Jeronymo  and ours  in saluting you our Brother   He took my hand  and  embracing me as such  You deal nobly with me  my Lord  said I  I resign myself to your direction   Jeronymo affectionately held out his arms  and joyfully saluted me as his Brother  The Marquis  the Count  each took my hand  And  the Marchioness offering hers  I pressed it with my lips  and  withdrawing  hastened to my lodgings  with a heart  O Dr  Bartlett  how penetrated by a suspense so strange and unexpected   But when they attribute to flight  and unsoundness of mind  that glorious passage  in which she proposes to take a revenge so noble on the cruel Laurana  they seem unable to comprehend  as I can easily do  the greatness of mind of this admirable woman   Page  152  LETTER
