delicious dream  and can scarce yet believe myself so blessed as   to be the father of such a child       In the mean time Harry had called John aside  Mr  John  says   he  here are five hundred guineas  Be pleased to step and distribute   them by twenty guineas to each of the families in the village    I would save you the trouble  and give them myself  but that for   the present my heart turns with disgust from their thanks and   their honours  Tell them  that this is a token hi memory of my         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  347     dear brother  to keep them in mind of him  Tell them further    that I will have no carousals  no rejoicing  on account of my   arrival   and that it would please me infinitely better  if my return   would bring their late losses to their remembrance  and set them   all in tears and lamentations      My lord now proposed a saunter in the park  in order to procure   an appetite for dinner  Accordingly the gate was ordered to be   unlocked  and they entered on a gravel walk  that was walled in   on the left hand  and paled in on the right  along the verge of five   canals  that fell successively in cascades  the one into the other      As they talked and walked along  they met with a six barred   gate that directly thwarted their passage  and my lord reached   his hand through the rails for the key  that the keeper had left in   the lock on the inside  but he could not get at it  We are all at a   full stop now  said he  unless Harry could make a shift to climb   over the gate   but no  do not  my dear   your foot might happen   to slip between the rails  and hurt you  I will obey your lordship    answered Harry   I will not venture a foot upon one of them  So   saying  he catched at the upmost bar with his left hand  and   throwing himself slightly over  opened the gate for his companions    The earl and Mr  Meekly stood mute in utter astonishment  At   length the earl cried Child  you must surely be of more than mortal   mould  or else you have a familiar spirit that conveys you through   the air  Harry smiled  but was silent      On their return  John called his master aside  and told him of   his due distribution of Harry s bounty to the villagers  But my   lord  says he  when I went down I found them all very busily   employed in preparing bonfires and illuminations in honour of my   young lord  This  however  I was obliged to countermand by his   special order   and it has greatly mortified all your poor people    Well  well  said the earl  it cannot be helped for the present   we   must not dare to offend our Harry at any rate  and so those   matters of rejoicing may rest in reserve till the arrival of my   brother      Soon afterwards our hero s fosterers came  decked out in their   best attire   and Harry ordered a side table to be covered for him   and them  but my lord insisted on their dining all together      Harry placed himself very lovingly between them at table  that   he might help them  and prevail upon their bashfulness to eat      When the repast was nearly over  nurse inquired after the little   beggar boy  whose absence she imagined had caused the elopement   of her darling  He is come to great fortune  answered Harry   he   has found his father and mother  and is heir to a large estate    Harry then told the manner in which Ned had been discovered    and they were all highly pleased and affected by the relation      But  says Harry  what has become of my sister Nelly  on whose   milk I was suckled  and what has become of my little brother   Tommy  who was but two years younger than myself  They are   both dead  my precious  but God has been pleased to give me   others in their room  Well  nurse  I find we must all die  and    some time or other  that will be a great grief to one of us  which    ever of us shall happen to outlive the other  I am satisfied to die         348 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      once  said nurse  but never let me hear again of your dying  my   angel
