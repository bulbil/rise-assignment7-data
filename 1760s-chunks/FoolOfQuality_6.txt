Brooke is particularly   anxious to elicit some decisive expression of his patron s   religious views   but Pope s replies  for he was at heart a   good Catholic  are  very cautiously worded    It is im    possible   says Pope   I should answer your letter any   further than by a sincere avowal that I do not deserve a   tenth part of what you say of me as a writer   but as a man   I will not  nay  I ought not  in gratitude to him to whom I   owe whatever I am  and whatever I can confess  to his   glory  I will not say I deny that you think no better of me   than I deserve  I sincerely worship God  believe in his   revelations  resign to his dispensations  love all his creatures    am in charity with all denominations of Christians  however   violently they treat each other  and detest none so much as   that profligate race who would loosen the bands of morality    either under the pretence of religion or free thinking     Such views were too broad and liberal  and too non    committal  to satisfy many people in those days  when    except where the influence of Methodism had fallen on   fruitful soil  there was more dogmatism than Christianity    Brooke was  however  one of those who valued religion   more than formalism   he was never a party man  even on   those matters which stirred his feelings most profoundly    There is evidence enough of that in his political attitude    which was so independent that it annoyed Whigs and   Tories  Protestants and Catholics almost equally  His   brother  Robert Brooke  and two of the latter s sons  became   Methodists  Another Henry Brooke  the eldest of the two   nephews of our Henry Brooke  distinguished himself by his   fervent piety  In his life  compiled by Dr  Isaac d Olier    there is a full account of his spiritual history  and of his   correspondence with the Rev  John William de la Fle chere    or Fletcher  Vicar of Madeley  the friend of Wesley  and one   of the most devout and earnest workers in the Methodist   cause  This Henry Brooke Junior was himself an active   labourer in the same field   several hymns and meditations   composed by him are inserted in his memoir  The tide of   Methodism reached our Henry Brooke  but he was not   carried away by it  A letter written by his daughter   Charlotte to her friend Miss Thompson shows how he   regarded certain of their tenets          xiv INTRODUCTION     What effect the opinion of an adored wife might then  at the time he   wrote the latter part of the Fool of Quality  have had upon his mind  I   cannot answer   but I know that while capable of judging  he con    demned the doctrines of the Methodists  I remember a reply he once   made to one of them upon that very subject of the wrath of vindictive   Deity     Sir  if you would teach that God so hated the world  I cannot   become your disciple      My God is a God of love  and he tells me   that he so loved the world  If you had rather worship a God of hatred   than a God of love  I must beg leave to depart from your worship      His sympathy with the better part of Methodism   appears at large in the pages of The Fool of Quality   and   is corroborated by the fact that John Wesley himself   thought fit to issue that book as an illustration of what he   thought noblest in the conduct of life  In the life of Henry   Brooke Junior  it is related that the book fell into the hands   of Mr  Fletcher  of Madeley  who  supposing it to be written   by him  wrote in strong approval of the religious and moral   sentiments contained in it  and asked his correspondent if   he lived up to them      In the year 1745 old Mr  Brooke died in embarrassed   circumstances  About this time Henry was made barrack    master of Mullingar  1 in which appointment he distinguished   himself  as Kingsley relates  by the publication of his   pamphlet on the various abuses connived at by the   authorities  This lengthy pamphlet ran into three editions    I have never seen it  but the writer in The Dublin University   Magazine describes Brooke s manner very graphically  He   says     With a patient flail he threshed the whole matter   sheaf by sheaf  occasionally turning his weapon and   flourishing fierce blows against any little abuse
