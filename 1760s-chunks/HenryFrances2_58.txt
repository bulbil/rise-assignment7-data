owing to the punctual Exactness of my own Disposition  that I am hurt at the most trifling Breach of Promise  when committed by any Person  for whom I have the least Regard  For these Reasons  I have felt more Uneasiness at the frequent Disappointment of my Expectations  with Regard to your coming to Town  than I should from a Certainty of your not coming these six Months —But a Truce with the Subject  Page  218 for I am determined never to mention it more   I am mighty glad you have escaped from the disagreeable Circumstances you mention  and are so happy with your agreeable Friend  As it is not in my Power to make you Amends for the Loss of his Conversation  I shall not detain you longer  than while I subscribe myself   Sincerely your s  Frances   LETTER CCLXI   I AM returned home safe to my Elysium  and did not see so sweet a Place since I left it  A Cow dead  two Sheep  six Turkeys  two Ducks  and a Goose  stolen  was all my Loss  while I was away  I forgot  a Ferret died  These Things have greatly ruffled the Calmness of my Uncle s Humour  especially the first  for it was one of my Weaver s Cows  which I had sold to him  about a Month before  and thought it between half honest and half humane to make good his Loss  My Uncle disputed very logically with me  upon this Head  that it was not an Act which Honesty required  because I had fulfilled my Part already  in delivering the Cow  and was not to be a Guarantee against Accidents  He said  that Humanity was no Page  219 more concerned with him  than any other Object of Charity   c   c  All which I acknowledge to be true  and yet I had some strong Idea roving in my Mind  that I was but acting justly  not from any particular Law of Morality or Religion  but from something higher  that adapts itself to many nice Circumstances  which express Laws cannot reach  This is  I suppose  what the Philosophers and Divines stile Conscience  something  as Prior expresses it    Beyond the fix d and settled Rules  Of Vice and Virtue in the Schools   c    There is  certainly  such a Thing as original Truth  coeval with Eternity  Part of the Essence of God  and not a Law of his ordaining  This is that charming Idea  which the Mind of Man contemplates in itself with so much philosophic Rapture  This primitive Reason is the great Criterion  which guides noble or uninslaved Minds  when they see fit to depart from  exceed  or act directly opposite to the express Laws of God  or Man  which being but imperfect Deductions from that original Source  necessarily established for the Regulation of Men s Lives  who have not Sense or Leisure to contemplate the native Beauty of Truth  or Virtue enough to embrace it  may be deviated  according as Reason or Conscience instructs the unprejudiced Mind  the great Law would have Page  220 been directed in such a particular Case or Instance  I am extremely provoked at the unphilosophic Assertion of Descartes   that two and two make four  not from original Necessity  but because God Almighty willed it so     I have just sent to the Stage  and  if a Place be vacant  I shall go up to Town in it   Adieu   Henry   LETTER CCLXII   NOT one Word from my Pet these two Posts  Perhaps you did not get my Letters regularly  while I was on my Route  for I did not know the Course of the Posts  as well as I do at home  You see how ready I am to make an Excuse for you  and attribute your Omission to any thing  rather than vex myself with vain Fears of your Sickness or Neglect  but  in such a Case  I know that my dear Heautontimorumenos would immediately conclude me indifferent to her  or dead to myself —And indeed you may as well suppose me one  as the other   But this is nothing to the principal Business of this Letter  which is to desire Tea exactly at Seven o Clock  on Tuesday Evening   Page  221  None enter may  but Love  and he  Shall guard the Door  and keep the Key   As  I dare say  my Life thinks this Account Entertainment enough for this Post  I shall husband what little Wit  or Sense  I have  for another Occasion  and conclude myself   My dear Girl   Your s eternally  Henry   LETTER CCLXIII   Dear FANNY   I AM alone here  for my Uncle is in the Rheumatism again at —  I want nothing but you  to compleat my Happiness here  You cannot imagine the different Sensations I have in this present Vacation  from what I am sensible of  when I have peevish or difficult People to deal with  In short  Peace is  to the Mind  what Health Is to the Body  Grace to Religion  and Chearfulness to Virtue  Without these enlivening Qualities  how dead and
