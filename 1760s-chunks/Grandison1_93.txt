exulted he   Still I screamed for help  and he put his hand before my mouth  tho  vowing honour  and such sort of stuff  and  with his unmanly roughness  made me bite my lip  And away lashed the coachman with your poor Harriet   LETTER XXXIII  Miss BYRON In Continuation   AS the chariot drove by houses  I cried out for help once or twice  at setting out  But under pretence of preventing my taking cold  he tied an handkechief over my face  head  and mouth  having first muffled me up in the cloak  pressing against my arm with his whole weight  so that I had not my hands at liberty  And when he had done  he seized them  and held them both in his left hand  while his right arm thrown round me  kept me fast on the seat  And except that now and then my struggling head gave me a little opening  I was blinded   But at one place on the road  just after I had screamed  and made another effort to get my hands free  I heard voices  and immediately the chariot stopt  Then   229 how my heart was filled with hope  But  alas  it was but momentary  I heard one of his men say  that Wilson I believe  The best of husband s  I assure you  Sir  and she is the worst of wives   I screamed again  Ay  scream and be d—n d  I heard said in a stranger s voice  if that be the case  Poor gentleman  I pity him with all my heart  And immediately the coachman drove on again   The vile wretch laughed  That s you  my dear  and hugged me round  You are the d—n d wife  And again he laughed  By my soul I am a charming contriver  Greville  Fenwick  Orme  where are you now —By my soul  this will be a pretty story to tell when all your fears are over  my Byron   I was ready to faint several times  I begged for air  And when we were in an open road  and I suppose there was nobody in sight  he vouchsafed to pull down the blinding handkerchief  but kept it over my mou•h  so that except now and then  that I struggled it aside with my head  and my neck is still  my dear  very stiff with my efforts to free my face  I could only make a murmuring kind of noise   The curtain of the fore glass was pulled down  and generally the canvas on both sides drawn up  But I was sure to be made acquainted when we came near houses  by his care again to blind and stifle me up   A little before we were met by my deliverer  I had  by getting one hand free  unmuffled myself so far as to see  as I had guessed once or twice before by the stone pavements  that we were going thro  a town  and then I again vehemently screamed  But he had the cruelty to thrust an handkerchief into my mouth  so that I was almost stran•led  and my mouth was hurt  and is still sore  with that and his former violence of the like nature   Indeed  he now and then made apologies for the cruelty  to which  he said▪ he was compelled  by my invincible obstinacy  to have recourse  I was sorely   230 hurt  he said  to be the wife of a man of his consideration  But I should be that  or worse  He was in for it  he said more than once  and must proceed  I might see that all my resistance was in vain  He had me in his net  And d—n him  if he were not revenged for all the trouble I had given him  You keep no terms with me  my Byron  said he once  and d—n me  if I keep any with you   I doubted not his malice  His Love had no tenderness in it  But how could I think of being consenting  as I may say  to such barbarous usage  and by a man so truly odious to me  What a slave had I been in spirit  could I have qualified on such villainous treatment as I had met with  or had I been able to desert myself   At one place the chariot drove out of the road  over rough ways  and little hillocks  as I thought by its rocking  and then  it stopping  he let go my hands  and endeavoured to footh me  He begged I would be pacified  and offered  if I would forbear crying out for help  to leave my eyes unmuffled all the rest of the way  But I would not  I told him  give such a sanction to his barbarous violence   On the chariot s stopping  one of his men came up  and put an handkerchief into his master s hands  in which were some cakes and sweet meats  and gave him also a bottle of sack  with a glass  Sir Hargrave was very urgent with me to take some of the sweet meats  and
