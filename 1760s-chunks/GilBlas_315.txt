the said washes  creams  tapes  laces  silk  thread  toys  and pedlar s ware  but trade not being brisk enough to live comfortably by it  she turned fortune teller  This drew her customers  got her countenance  credit  crowns  and pistoles  a thousand dupes of either sex soon trumpeted up the reputation of Coselina  for so my gipsy mamma had the honour to be named  Some one or other came every day to bargain for the exercise of her skill in the black art  at one time a nephew at his wit s and purse s end  wanting to know how soon his uncle was to set off post for the other world  and leave behind him wherewithal to piece his worn out fortunes  at another  some yielding  love sick girl  to inquire whether the swain who kept her company  and had promised to marry her  would keep his word or be false hearted   You will take notice  if you please  that my mother always sold good luck for good money  if the accomplishment trod on the heels of the prediction  well and good  if it was fulfilled according to the rule of contraries  she was always cool  though the parties were ever so violently in a passion  and told them plainly that it was her familiar s fault  not hers  for though she paid him the highest wages  and bound him by potent spells to stir up the cauldron of futurity from the bottom  like earthly cooks  he would sometimes be careless or out of humour  and apportion the ingredients wrongly   When my mother thought the conjuncture momentous enough to raise the devil without cheapening him in the eyes of the vulgar  Torribio Scipio enacted his infernal majesty  and played the part just as if he had been born to it  humouring the hideous features of the character by a very small aggravation of his own natural face  and practising the pandemonian note of elocution in the lower octave of his voice  A person in the slightest degree superstitious would be scared out of his senses at my father s figure  But one day  as his satanic prototype would have it  there came a savage rascal of a captain  who asked to see the devil  for no earthly purpose but to run him clean through the body  The Inquisition  having received notice of the devil s death  sent to take charge of his widow  and administer to his effects  as for poor little me  just seven years old at the time  I was sent to the foundling hospital  There were some charitable ecclesiastics on that establishment  who  being liberally paid for the education of the poor orphans  were so zealous in their office as to teach them reading and writing  They fancied there was something particularly promising about me  which made them pick me out from all the rest  and send me on their errands  I was letter carrier  messenger  and chapel clerk  As a token of their gratitude  they undertook to teach me Latin  but their mode of tuition was so harsh  and their discipline so severe  though I was a sort of pet with them  that  not being able to stand it any longer  I ran away one morning while out on an errand  and  so far from returning to the hospital  got out of Toledo through the suburbs on the Seville side   Though I had not then completed my ninth year  I already felt the pleasure of being free  and master of my own actions  I was without money and without food  no matter  I had no lessons to say by heart  no themes to hammer out  After having pushed on for two hours  my little legs began to refuse their office  I had never before made so long a trip  It became necessary to stop and take some rest  I sat myself down at the foot of a tree close by the high  way  there  by way of amusement  I took my grammar out of my pocket  and began conning it over by way of a joke  but at length  coming to recollect the raps on the knuckles  and the castigations on the more classical seat of punishment which it had cost me  I tore it leaf by leaf with an apostrophe of angry import  Ah  you odious thing of a book  you shall never make me shed tears any more  While I was assuaging my vindictive spirit  by strewing the ground about me with declensions and conjugations  there passed that way a hermit with a white beard  with a large pair of spectacles on his nose  and altogether an outside of much sanctity  He came up to me  and  if I was an object of speculation to him  he was no less so to me  My little man  said he with a smile  it should seem as if we had both taken a sudden liking to each other  and in that case we cannot do better than to live together in my hermitage  which is not two hundred yards distant  Your most obedient for that  answered I pertly enough  I have not the least desire to turn hermit  At this answer  the good old man set up a roar of
