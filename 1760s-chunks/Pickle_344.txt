should take place upon a  youth of Peregrine s fiery disposition  which  on some occasions  would  have actually justified any remarks of this kind  which his greatest  enemies could make  He was accordingly represented as one of those  enterprising bucks  who  after having spent their fortunes in riot and  excess  are happily bereft of their understanding  and consequently  insensible of the want and disgrace which they have entailed upon  themselves  Cadwallader himself was so much affected with the report   that for some time he hesitated in his deliberations upon our hero   before he could prevail upon himself to communicate to him the  information he had received  or to treat him in other respects as a  man of sound intellects  At length  however  he ventured to make Pickle  acquainted with the particulars he had learned  imparting them with such  caution and circumlocution  as he thought necessary to prevent the young  gentleman from transgressing all bounds of temper and moderation  but   for once  he was agreeably deceived in his prognostic  Incensed as our  hero was at the conduct of the minister  he could not help laughing at  the ridiculous aspersion  which he told his friend he would soon refute  in a manner that should not be very agreeable to his calumniator   observing  that it was a common practice with the state pilot  thus to  slander those people to whom he lay under obligations which he had no  mind to discharge   True it is   said Peregrine  he has succeeded more  than once in contrivances of this kind  having actually reduced divers  people of weak heads to such extremity of despair  as hath issued in  downright distraction  whereby he was rid of their importunities  and  his judgment confirmed at the same time  But I have now  thank Heaven   attained to such a pitch of philosophical resolution  as will support me  against all his machinations  and I will forthwith exhibit the  monster to the public  in his true lineaments of craft  perfidy  and  ingratitude    This indeed was the plan with which Mr  Pickle had amused himself during  the researches of Crabtree  and by this time it so effectually flattered  his imagination  that he believed he should be able to bring his  adversary  in spite of all his power  to his own terms of submission  by  distinguishing himself in the list of those who  at that period  wrote  against the administration  Nor was this scheme so extravagant as it  may seem to be  had not he overlooked one material circumstance  which  Cadwallader himself did not recollect  when he approved of this project   While he thus meditated vengeance  the fame of his disorder  in due    6 22 15  3 45 PM   course of circulation  reached the ears of that lady of quality whose  memoirs have already appeared in these adventures  The correspondence  with which she had honoured our hero had been long broke off for the  reason already advanced  namely  his dread of being exposed to her  infatuating charms  He had been candid enough to make her acquainted  with the cause of exiling himself from her presence  and she admitted  the prudence of self restraint  although she would have very well  satisfied with the continuance of his intimacy and conversation   which were not at all beneath the desire of any lady in the kingdom   Notwithstanding this interruption  she still retained a friendship and  regard for his character  and felt all the affliction of a humane heart   at the news of his misfortunes and deplorable distemper  She had seen  him courted and cultivated in the sunshine of his prosperity  but she  knew  from sad experience  how all those insect followers shrink away in  the winter of distress  Her compassion represented him as a poor unhappy  lunatic  destitute of all the necessaries of life  dragging about the  ruins of human nature  and exhibiting the spectacle of blasted youth  to the scorn and abhorrence of his fellow creatures  Aching with these  charitable considerations  she found means to learn in what part of the  town he lodged and  laying aside all superfluous ceremony  went in a  hackney chair to his door  which was opened by the ever faithful Pipes   Her ladyship immediately recollected the features of his trusty  follower  whom she could not help loving in her heart for his attachment  and fidelity  which after she had applauded with a most gracious  commendation  she kindly inquired after the state of his master s  health  and asked if he was in a condition to be seen  Tom  who could  not suppose that the visit of a fine lady would be unacceptable to a  youth of Peregrine s complexion  made no verbal reply to the question   but beckoning her ladyship with an arch significance of feature  at  which she could not forbear smiling  walked softly up stairs  and she   in obedience to the signal  followed her guide into the apartment of our  hero  whom she found at a writing table  in the very act of composing
