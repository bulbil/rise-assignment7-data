be happy        I have a thousand things to say to you  but am setting off immediately with Sir George Clayton  to meet the lieutenant governor at Montreal  a piece of respect which I should pay with the most lively pleasure  if it did not give me the opportunity of seeing the woman in the world I most admire  I am not however going to set you the example of marrying  I am not so happy  she is engaged to the gentleman who goes up with me  Adieu   Yours   ED  RIVERS     LETTER XV   15    To Miss MONTAGUE  at Montreal   Silleri  Sept  16   TAKE care  my dear Emily  you do not fall into the common error of sensible and delicate minds  that of refining away your happiness       Sir George is handsome as an Adonis  you allow him to be of an amiable character  he is rich  young  well born  and loves you  you will have fine cloaths  fine jewels  a fine house  a coach and six  all the douceurs of marriage  with an extreme pretty fellow  who is fond of you  whom you see with pleasure  and prefer to all his sex  and yet you are discontented  because you have not for him at twenty four the romantic passion of fifteen  or rather that ideal passion which perhaps never existed but in imagination       To be happy in this world  it is necessary not to raise one s ideas too high  if I loved a man of Sir George s fortune half as well as by your own account you love him  I should not hesitate one moment about marrying  but sit down contented with ease  affluence  and an agreeable man  without expecting to find life what it certainly is not  a state of continual rapture   Tis  I am afraid  my dear  your misfortune to have too much sensibility to be happy       I could moralize exceedingly well this morning on the vanity of human wishes and expectations  and the folly of hoping for felicity in this vile sublunary world  but the subject is a little exhausted  and I have a passion for being original  I think all the moral writers  who have set off with promising to shew us the road to happiness  have obligingly ended with telling us there is no such thing  a conclusion extremely consoling  and which if they had drawn before they set pen to paper  would have saved both themselves and their readers an infinity of trouble  This fancy of hunting for what one knows is not to be found  is really an ingenious way of amusing both one s self and the world  I wish people would either write to some purpose  or be so good as not to write at all       I believe I shall set about writing a system of ethics myself  which shall be short  clear  and comprehensive  nearer the Epicurean perhaps than the Stoic  but rural  refined  and sentimental  rural by all means  for who does not know that virtue is a country gentlewoman  all the good mammas will tell you  there is no such being to be heard of in town       I shall certainly be glad to see you  my dear  though I foresee strange revolutions in the state of Denmark from this event  at present I have all the men to myself  and you must know I have a prodigious aversion to divided empire  however   tis some comfort they all know you are going to be married  You may come  Emily  only be so obliging to bring Sir George along with you  in your present situation  you are not so very formidable       The men here  as I said before  are all dying for me  there are many handsomer women  but I flatter them  and the dear creatures cannot resist it  I am a very good girl to women  but naturally artful  if you will allow the expression  to the other sex  I can blush  look down  stifle a sigh  flutter my fan  and seem so agreeably confused you have no notion  my dear  what fools men are  If you had not got the start of me  I would have had your little white haired baronet in a week  and yet I don t take him to be made of very combustible materials  rather mild  composed  and pretty  I believe  but he has vanity  which is quite enough for my purpose       Either your love or Colonel Rivers will have the honor to deliver this letter   tis rather cruel to take them both from us at once  however  we shall soon be made amends  for we shall have a torrent of beaux with the general       Don t you think the sun in this country vastly more chearing than in England  I am charmed with the sun  to say nothing of the moon  though to be sure I never saw a moon light night that deserved the name till I came to America       Mon cher pere desires a thousand compliments  you know he has been in love with you ever since
