   cheysal s master makes some steiking bemabks on his feiend s   accotjnt oe this mysteeiotts teansaction   and draws dteee    ences from it not commonly attended to â€” he entertains   his friend with a citeiotjs song  who makes an important   hit  jtrst in his own character  upon it â€” chrysax s master     BOGGLES A LITTLE AT FIRST  AT HIS FRIBNd s PROPOSAL  BUT IS   ENCOURAGED BY HIS EXAMPLE TO UNDERTAKE IT       I AM much obliged to you for such a proof of your confidence     returned my master    particularly as it clears up some points to   me  which I own gave me equal concern and surprise  and of which   delicacy prevented my desiring an explanation from you  These   were the manner in which that attack was made upon him  and   the arguments and proofs brought in support of it  which were so   unfair  inconclusive  and in many instances contradictory  that I   was astonished any man of sense and honesty could make use of    or be influenced by them          Why  that is very true  Their zeal often overshot the mark    to be sure  But that signified nothing  Set the public once upon   the scent of scandal  and they ll hunt it like bloodhoimds  through   thick and tliin  Nothing can be so gross as to stop them  You   may as well whistle to the wind to change its course  as speak reason   to the people when they have conceived a prejudice          But what is your opinion of that affair   Is he  or is he not    the impostor they would make him   For I confess  the arguments   by which they would prove him one are so far from answering their   design with me  that I think they prove the contrary  by proving    nothing  as it is natural to conclude that if there were any better    such would have not been made use of  But you certainly musC   have had suflficient opportunities of being informed in the intercourse   you necessarily had with them         As to that  I know no more of the matter than you do  nor ever   gave myself the trouble to inquire  All the intercourse I had with   them waa only to save appearances and get my money  Whether         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 491     he was an impostor or not was the same thing to me  I was paid   for seeming to prove him one  and that was all I cared for          But you continue to call him one still  Do they also pay you   for that now          No  I do that for my own credit  Were I to retract all  the   scandal that has been heaped upon him in my name would revert   npon myself  so that whenever I mention him  I am obliged to do    it m the old phrase  I know some squeamish people would have   scrupled the whole  but that is not my way of thinking  I hold   nothing to be so great a reproach as poverty  nor anything a sin   that can get over it  And so  here s my service to me  I wish you    could hit upon such another opportunity          And if I would scruple to make use of it  may I perish in my   present poverty  and I defy the devil to find a heavier curse        The conversation then turned to more general topics  in the course   of which my late master naturally coming to be mentioned â€”  That s   right   said my master    I have something to show you that will   give you pleasurei  You may remember  I told you  that I am   sometimes obliged to a printer of my acquaintance for helping me   to a job  in the letter or essay way  Happening to call upon him   this morning  to try if he could take anything from me  he showed   me this    pulling a piece of greasy paper out of his pocket    which   I think really a curiosity  It is a proof of a bawdy song  which   the gentleman we have been talking of wrote   and had a few copies   of printed for the amusement of his particular intimates  My   friend got it from one of his journeymen  who sometimes works   for that gentleman  and says there are a good many more of them    which are all printed together in a ballad  You ll find it worth   your reading
