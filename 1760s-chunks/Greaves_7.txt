and fear of those who believed and trembled at the visitation of spirits  ghosts  and goblins  He said he would engage with twelve pennyworth of phosphorus to frighten a whole parish out of their senses  then he expatiated on the pusillanimity of the nation in general  ridiculed the militia  censured the government  and dropped some hints about a change of hands  which the captain could not  and the doctor would not  comprehend   Tom Clarke  from the freedom of his discourse  concluded he was a ministerial spy  and communicated his opinion to his uncle in a whisper  while this misanthrope continued to pour forth his invectives with a fluency peculiar to himself  The truth is  Mr  Ferret had been a party writer  not from principle  but employment  and had felt the rod of power  in order to avoid a second exertion of which  he now found it convenient to skulk about in the country  for he had received intimation of a warrant from the secretary of state  who wanted to be better acquainted with his person  Notwithstanding the ticklish nature of his situation  it was become so habitual to him to think and speak in a certain manner  that even before strangers whose principles and connexions he could not possibly know  he hardly ever opened his mouth  without uttering some direct or implied sarcasm against the government   He had already proceeded a considerable way in demonstrating  that the nation was bankrupt and beggared  and that those who stood at the helm were steering full into the gulf of inevitable destruction  when his lecture was suddenly suspended by a violent knocking at the door  which threatened the whole house with inevitable demolition  Captain Crowe  believing they should be instantly boarded  unsheathed his hanger  and stood in a posture of defence  Mr  Fillet armed himself with the poker  which happened to be red hot  the ostler pulled down a rusty firelock  that hung by the roof  over a flitch of bacon  Tom Clarke perceiving the landlady and her children distracted with terror  conducted them  out of mere compassion  below stairs into the cellar  and as for Mr  Ferret  he prudently withdrew into an adjoining pantry   But as a personage of great importance in this entertaining history was forced to remain some time at the door before he could gain admittance  so must the reader wait with patience for the next chapter  in which he will see the cause of this disturbance explained much to his comfort and edification             CHAPTER TWO  IN WHICH THE HERO OF THESE ADVENTURES MAKES HIS FIRST APPEARANCE ON THE STAGE OF ACTION   The outward door of the Black Lion had already sustained two dreadful shocks  but at the third it flew open  and in stalked an apparition that smote the hearts of our travellers with fear and trepidation  It was the figure of a man armed cap a pee  bearing on his shoulders a bundle dropping with water  which afterwards appeared to be the body of a man that seemed to have been drowned  and fished up from the bottom of the neighbouring river   Having deposited his burden carefully on the floor  he addressed himself to the company in these words   Be not surprised  good people  at this unusual appearance  which I shall take an opportunity to explain  and forgive the rude and boisterous manner in which I have demanded  and indeed forced admittance  the violence of my intrusion was the effect of necessity  In crossing the river  my squire and his horse were swept away by the stream  and  with some difficulty  I have been able to drag him ashore  though I am afraid my assistance reached him too late  for since I brought him to land he has given no signs of life    Here he was interrupted by a groan  which issued from the chest of the squire  and terrified the spectators as much as it comforted the master  After some recollection  Mr  Fillet began to undress the body  which was laid in a blanket on the floor  and rolled from side to side by his direction  A considerable quantity of water being discharged from the mouth of this unfortunate squire  he uttered a hideous roar  and  opening his eyes  stared wildly around  Then the surgeon undertook for his recovery  and his master went forth with the ostler in quest of the horses  which he had left by the side of the river  His back was no sooner turned  than Ferret  who had been peeping from behind the pantry door  ventured to rejoin the company  pronouncing with a smile  or rather grin  of contempt   Hey day  what precious mummery is this  What  are we to have the farce of Hamlet s ghost    Adzooks   cried the captain   My kinsman Tom has dropped asternâ€”hope in God a has not bulged to  and gone to bottom    Pish   exclaimed the misanthrope   there s no danger  the young lawyer is only seizing Dolly in tail    Certain it is  Dolly squeaked at that instant in the cellar  and Clarke appearing soon after in some confusion  declared she had been frightened by a flash of
