may easier be conceived than represented                CHAPTER V       Seems to be calculated rather for the instruction than entertainment of   the reader          How great soever was the shock Miss Betsy had sustained in this   interview with Mr  Trueworth  he did not think himself much indebted to   fortune for having thrown her in his way  he had once loved her to a   very high degree  and though the belief of her unworthiness  the fond   endearments of one woman  and the real merits of another  had all   contributed to drive that passion from his breast  yet as a wound but   lately closed is apt to bleed afresh on every little accident  so there   required no less than the whole stock of the beautiful and discreet Miss   Harriot s perfections  to defend his heart from feeling anew some part   of its former pain  on this sudden and unexpected attack       Happy was it for him  that his judgment concurred with his present   inclination  and that he had such unquestionable reasons for justifying   the transition he had made of his affections from one object to another    else might he have relapsed into a flame which  if ever it had been   attended with any true felicity  must have been purchased at the expence   of an infinity of previous disquiets       He was now become extremely conversant with the family of Sir Bazil    visited there almost every day  was well received by both the sisters    and had many opportunities of penetrating into the real sentiments and   dispositions of Miss Harriot  which he found to be such as his most   sanguine wishes could have formed for the woman to be blest with whom he   would make choice of for a wife  When he compared the steady temper  the   affability  the ease  unaffected chearfulness  mixed with a becoming   reserve  which that young lady testified in all her words and actions    with the capricious turns  the pride  the giddy lightness  he had   observed in the behaviour of Miss Betsy  his admiration of the one was   increased by his disapprobation of the other       How great a pity it is  therefore  that a young lady  like Miss Betsy    so formed by heaven and nature to have rendered any man compleatly happy   in possessing her  inferior to her fair competitor neither in wit    beauty  nor any personal or acquired endowment  her inclinations no less   pure  her sentiments as noble  her disposition equally generous and   benign  should  through her own inadvertency  destroy all the merit of   so many amiable qualities  and  for the sake of indulging the wanton   vanity of attracting universal admiration  forfeit  in reality  those   just pretensions to which otherwise she had been entitled to from the   deserving and the discerning few       Mr  Trueworth  as the reader may have observed  did not all at once   withdraw his affections from the first object of them  nor transmit them   to the second but on very justifiable motives  The levity of Miss Betsy    and other branches of ill conduct  had very much weaned her from his   heart before the wicked artifices of Miss Flora had rendered her quite   contemptible in his opinion  and had not wholly devoted himself to the   beauties of Miss Harriot  till he was quite convinced the perfections of   her mind were such as could not fail of securing the conquest which her   eyes had gained       He did not however presently declare himself  he saw the friendship   between the two sisters would be somewhat of an obstacle to his hopes    he had heard that Miss Harriot had rejected several advantageous   proposals of marriage  merely because she would not be separated from   Mrs  Wellair  he also found  that Sir Bazil  though for what reason he   could not guess  seemed not very desirous of having his sister disposed   of  the only probable way  therefore  he thought  of obtaining his   wishes  was to conceal them till he found the means of insinuating   himself so far into the good graces both of the one and the other  as to   prevent them from opposing whatever endeavours he should make to engage   their sister to listen to his suit       The strategem had all the effect for which it was put in practice  the   intimacy he had long contracted with Sir Bazil now grew into so perfect   a friendship  that he scarce suffered a day to pass without an   invitation to his house  Mrs  Wellair expressed the highest esteem and   liking of his conversation  and Miss Harriot herself  not imagining of   what consequence
