fear they should engage themselves elsewhere  for happy man be his dole who can get them to dinner or supper  they are such excellent company   Away went he  and in the evening  at supper time  returned with six authors in his train  whom he presented one after another with a set speech in their praise  According to his account  the wits of Greece and Italy were nothing in comparison of these  whose works ought to be printed in letters of gold  I received this deputation from the tuneful sisters very politely  My behaviour was even in the extravagance of good breeding  for the republic of authors is a little monarchical in its demands upon our flattery  Though I had given Scipio no express direction respecting the number of covers at this entertainment  yet knowing what a hungry and voluptnous race were to be crammed  he had mustered the courses in more than their full complement   At length supper was announced  and we fell to merrily  My poets began talking of their poems and themselves  One fellow  with the most lyrical assurance  numbered up whole hosts of first rate nobility and high flying dames  who were quite enraptured with his muse  Another  though it was not for him to arraign the choice which a learned society had lately made of two new members  could not help saying that it was strange they should not have elected him  All the rest were much in the same story  Amid the clatter of knives and forks  my ears were more discordantly dinned with verses and harangues  They each took it by turns to give me a specimen of their composition  One languishes out a sonnet  another mouths a scene in a tragedy  and a third reads a melancholy criticism on the province of comedy  The next in turn spouts an ode of Anacreon  translated into most un anacreontic Spanish verse  One of his brethren interrupts him  to point out the unclassical use of a particular phrase  The author of the version by no means acquiesces in the remark  hence arises an argument  in which all the literati take one side or the other  Opinions are nearly balanced  the disputants are nearly in a passion  as argument weakens  invective grows stronger  they get from bad to worse  over goes the table  and up jump they to fisty cuffs  Fabricio  Scipio  my coachman  my footman  and myself  have scarcely lungs or strength to bring them to their senses  The moment the battle was over  off scampered they as if my house had been a tavern  without the slightest apology for their ill behaviour   Nunez  on whose word I had anticipated a very pleasant party  looked rather blue at this conclusion  Well  my friend  said I  what do you think of your literary acquaintance now  As sure as Apollo is on Parnassus  you brought me a most blackguard set  I will stick to my clerks  so talk no more to me about authors  I shall take care  answered he  not to invite any of them to a gentleman s house again  for these are the most select and well  mannered of the tribe       CH  X     The morals of Gil Blas become at court much as if they had never been at all  A commission from the Count de Lemos  which  like most court commissions  implies an intrigue   WHEN once my name was up for a man after the Duke of Lerma s own heart  I had very soon my court about me  Every morning was my ante chamber crowded with company  and my levees were all the fashion  Two sorts of customers came to my shop  one set  to engage my interposition with the minister  on fair commercial principles  the other set  to excite my compassion by pathetic statements of their cases  and give me a lift to heaven on the packhorse of charity  The first were sure of being heard patiently and served diligently  with regard to the second order  I got rid of them at once by plausible evasions  or kept them dangling till they wore their patience threadbare  and went off in a huff  Before I was about the court my nature was compassionate and charitable  but tenderness of heart is an unfashionable frailty there  and mine became harder than any flint  Here was an admirable school to correct the romantic sensibilities of friendship  nor was my philosophy any longer assailable in that quarter  My manner of dealing with Joseph Navarro  under the following circumstances  will prove more than volumes on that head   This Navarro  the founder of my fortune  to whom my obligations were thick and threefold  paid me a visit one day  With the warmest expressions of regard such as he was in the habit of lavishing  he begged me to ask the Duke of Lerma for a certain situation for one of his friends  a young man of excellent qualities and undoubted merit  but incumbered with an inability of getting on in the world  I am well assured  added Joseph  that with your good and obliging disposition  you will be enraptured to confer a favour on a worthy man with a very slender purse  I am sure you will feel obliged to
