to the Bonzes at his levee  symptoms that alarmed all his friends and dependants  Instead of frequenting the assemblies of the great  he now attended assiduously at all groanings and christenings  grew extremely fond of caudle  and held conferences with practitioners  both male and female  in the art of midwifry  When business or ceremony obliged him to visit any of the Quos or Quanbukus of Meaco  he  by a surprising instinct  ran directly to the nursery  where  if there happened to be a child in the cradle  he took it up  and if it was foul  wiped it with great care and seeming satisfaction  He  moreover    115 learned of the good women to sing lullabies  and practised them with uncommon success  but the most extravagant of all his whims  was what he exhibited one day in his own court yard  Observing a nest with some eggs  which the goose had quitted  he forthwith dropped his trowsers  and squatting down in the attitude of incubation  began to stretch out his neck  to hiss and to cackle  as if he had been really metamorphosed into the animal whose place he now supplied   It was on the back of this adventure that one of the Bonzes  as prying  and as great a gossip as the barber of Midas  in paying his morning worship to the Cuboy s posteriors  spied something  or rather nothing  and was exceedingly affrighted  He communicated his discovery and apprehension to divers others of the cloth  and they were all of   116 opinion that some effectual inquisition should be held on this phaenomenon  lest the clergy of Japan should hereafter be scandalized  as having knowingly kissed the breech of an old woman  perhaps a monster or magician  Information was accordingly made to the Dairo  who gave orders for immediate inspection  and Fika kaka was formally examined by a jury of matrons  Whether these were actuated by undue influence  I shall not at present explain  certain it is  they found their verdict  The Cuboy non mas  and among other evidences produced to attest his metamorphosis  a certain Ximian  who pretended to have the second sight  made oath that he had one evening seen the said Fika kaka in a female dress  riding through the air on a broom stick  The unhappy Cuboy being thus convicted  was divested of his office  and confined   117 to his palace in the country  while Gio gio  by the advice of his favourite  published a proclamation  declaring it was not for the honour of Japan that her treasury should be managed either by a witch or an old woman   Fika kaka being thus removed  Yak strot was appointed treasurer and Cuboy in his place  and now ruled the roast with uncontrouled authority  On the very threshold of his greatness  however  he made a false step  which was one cause of his tottering  during the whole sequel of his administration  In order to refute the calumnies and defeat the intrigues of Taycho in the assemblies of the people  he chose as an associate in the ministry Fokh sirokhu  who was at that instant the most unpopular man in the whole empire of Japan  and at the instigation of this collegue  deprived of   118 bread a great number of poor families  who subsisted on petty places which had been bestowed upon them by the former Cuboy  Those were so many mouths opened to augment the clamour against his own person and administration   It might be imagined  that while he thus set one part of the nation at defiance  he would endeavour to cultivate the other  and  in particular  strive to conciliate the good will of the nobility  who did not see his exaltation without umbrage  But  instead of ingratiating himself with them by a liberal turn of demeanour  by treating them with frankness and affability  granting them favours with a good grace  making entertainments for them at his palace  and mixing in their social parties of pleasure  Yak strot always appeared on the reserve  and under all his finery  continually wore a doublet of buckram    119 which gave an air of stiffness and constraint to his whole behaviour  He studied postures  and  in giving audience  generally stood in the attitude of the idol Fo  so that he sometimes was mistaken for an image of stone  He formed a scale of gesticulation in a great variety of divisions  comprehending the slightest inclination of the head  the front nod  the side nod  the bow  the half  the semi demi bow  with the shuffle  the slide  the circular  semi circular  and quadrant sweep of the right foot  With equal care and precision did he model the oeconomy of his looks into the divisions and sub divisions of the fullstare  the side glance  the pensive look  the pouting look  the gay look  the vacant look  and the stolid look  To these different expressions of the eye he suited the corresponding features of the nose and mouth  such as the wrinkled nose  the retorted   120 nose  the sneer  the grin  the simper  and the smile  All these postures and gesticulations he practised  and distributed occasionally  according to the difference of rank and importance of the various individuals
