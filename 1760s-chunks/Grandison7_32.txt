of her heart  But—He stopt   But what  my dear Sir —Alas  she says that you have strengthened the hands of her friends  Am I forgiven before I go any further   Not  my Harriet  if you think it necessary to ask such a question  Blame me always  when you think me wrong  I shall doubt your Love  if you give me reason to question your freedom   Dear Sir —But answer me  Would you have Clementina  circumstanced as she is  marry   What answer can I return to my Harriet s question  when sometimes I am ready to favour the parents pleas  at others  the daughter s  I would not have her either compelled  or over earnestly persuaded  The family plead     That their happiness  her health and peace  depend on her marriage  They cannot bear to think of rewarding Laurana for her cruelty  with an estate that never was designed for her  and to the cutting it off  as it may happen  from their Giacomo and his descendants for ever  in case Clementina assumes the veil  The health▪ of the father and mother are declining  They wish but to live to see the alliance with the Count of Belvedere take place  The noble Lady gave reasons that could be answered  She had  by her own magnanimity  got over a greater difficulty  if I may presume to say so  than they had required her to struggle with  how could I avoid advising her to yield to the supplications   81 of parents  of brothers  of an uncle  who  however mistaken in the means by which they seek to obtain their wishes  love not their own souls  better than they love their Clementina        It was  besides  a measure by which only at the time  I could demonstrate  and the General  I know  considered it as a test  that I really gave up all hopes of her myself —And when I had owned  that there was a woman  with whom I had no doubt of being happy  could I engage her to accept of me  they all besought me  for their sakes  for Clementina s  to court that acceptance  having hopes  that tho  she could not set me an example  she would follow mine      This  my dearest Life  was the occasion  as I told your friends  of accelerating my declaration to you  I could not else  either for the sake of your delicacy or my own  so soon have made proposals  not even to Mrs  Shirley  for  situated as I was  I could not think of applying to you till I had strengthened myself  as I hoped to do  by her interest  Your generous acceptance  signified to me by that good Lady  has for ever obliged me  I regarded it  my Harriet  circumstanced as I had been  and shall ever regard it  as a condescension  which  as I told that Lady  at the time  laid me under an obligation that I never  by my utmost gratitude  shall be able to repay   O Sir  well have you shewn that you meant what you said  How poor a return  hiding my face in his generous bosom  is my Love for so much goodness  and kind consideration   He clasped me to the faithfullest of human hearts   But  dear Sir  I find  I find  on the whole  that you think Lady Clementina has not so much reason on her side  as her parents have on theirs   My tenderness for her  my dear  because of her unhappy malady  and my apprehension of a return of it  together with my admiration of her noble qualities    82 prejudice me strongly in her favour  If she could be convinced by their motives  I should be ready to own my convictions in favour of these  But if she cannot  neither can I  so partial am I in the cause of a Lady I so sincerely admire  and who has been so much afflicted  But what  in the situation they and she were in  remain for me to do  but to advise the family to proceed with tenderness and patience  that their Clementina might have time to weigh  to consider  their reasons  their indulgence  You  my dear  shall see in the copies of the Letters I have written since I have been in England  my remonstrances to them on their precipitating her  But they were in a train  They presumed on the characteristic duty of their Clementina  They flattered themselves  that sometimes she seemed to relent  They conceived hopes from the expressions of compassion for the Count of Belvedere  which sometimes she let fall  The General  who  though a generous man  can do nothing moderately  would not be satisfied with cold measures  as he called them  and  not doubting his sister s acquiescence with her duty  if once she could be prevailed upon to think her compliance such  they were resolved to pursue the train they were in  But in order to avoid their importunities  how has the dear Clementina shifted the scene
