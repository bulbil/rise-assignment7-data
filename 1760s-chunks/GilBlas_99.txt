dress  and write for him as his secretary  Heaven be praised for my apotheosis  Like the triple Hecate of the Pantheon  I am to enact three different characters at the same time  Can you guess my intention  continued he  Thus it is  but take care what you are about  your life may depend on it  As I am continually meeting with fellows who boast of their success among the women  I mean  by way of getting the upper hand  to fill my pockets with fictitious love letters  and read them in company  It will be amusing enough  Happier than my competitors  who make conquests only for the pleasure of the boast  I shall take the credit of intrigue  and spare myself the labour  But vary your writing  so that the manufacture may not be detected by the sameness of the hand   I then sat down to comply with the commands of Don Matthias  who first dictated a tender epistle to this tune    You did not keep your promise to night  Ah  Don Matthias  how will you exculpate yourself  My error was a cruel one  But you punish me deservedly for my vanity  in fancying that business and amusement were all to give way before the pleasure of seeing Donna Clara de Mendoza  After this pretty note  he made me write another  as if from a lady who sacrificed a prince to him  and then a third  whose fair writer offered  if she could rely on his discretion  to embark with him for the shores of Cytherean enchantment  It was not enough to dictate these love sick strains  he forced me to subscribe them with the most high flying names in Madrid  I could not forbear hinting at some little hazard in all this  but he begged me to keep my sage counsels till they were called for  I was obliged to hold my tongue  and dispatch his orders out of hand  That done  he got up  and dressed with my assistance  The letters were put into his pocket  and out he went  I followed him to dinner with Don Juan de Moncade  who entertained five or six gentlemen of his acquaintance that day   There was a grand set out  and mirth  the best relish  was not wanting to the banquet  All the guests contributed to enliven the conversation  some by wit and humour  others by anecdotes of which the relaters were the heroes  My master would not lose so fine an opportunity of bringing our joint performances to bear  He read them audibly  and with so much assurance  that probably the whole party  with the exception of his secretary  was taken in by the device  Among the company  before whom this trick was so impudently played off  there was one person  by name Don Lope de Velasco  This person  a very grave don  instead of making himself merry like the rest with the fictitious triumphs of the reader  asked him coolly if the conquest of Donna Clara had been achieved with any great difficulty  Less than the least  answered Don Matthias  the advances were all on her side  She saw me in public  and took a fancy to my person  A scout was commissioned to follow me  and thus she got at my name and condition  She wrote to me  and gave me an appointment at an hour of the night when the house was sure to be quiet  I was true as the needle to the pole  her bedchamber was the place         But prudence and delicacy forbid my describing what passed there   At this instance of tender regard for the lady s character  Signor de Velasco betrayed some very passionate workings in his countenance  It was easy to see the interest he took in the subject  All these letters  said he to my master  looking at him with an eye of indignation and contempt  are infamous forgeries  and above all that which you boast of having received from Donna Clara de Mendoza  There is not in all Spain a more modest young creature than her  self  For these two years  a gentleman  at least your equal in birth and personal merit  has been trying every method of insinuating himself into her heart  Scarcely have his assiduities extorted the slightest encouragement  but yet he may flatter himself that  if anything beyond common civility had been granted at all  it would have been to him only  Well  Who says to the contrary  interrupted Don Matthias in a bantering way  I agree with you  that the lady is a very pretty behaved young lady  On my part  I am a very pretty behaved young gentleman  Ergo  you may rest assured that nothing took place between us but what was pretty and well behaved  Indeed  This is too much  interrupted Don Lope in his turn  let us lay aside this unseasonable jesting  You are an impostor  Donna Clara never gave you an appointment by night  Her reputation shall not be blackened by your ribaldry  But prudence and delicacy forbid my describing what must pass between you and me  With this retort on his lips  he looked contemptuously round  and withdrew with a menacing aspect  which anticipated serious consequences to
