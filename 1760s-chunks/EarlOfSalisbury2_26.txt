 in view  near the castle walls       there let me see my sentence executed without delay         And without delay did they proceed to execute this dreadful sentence   The wicked Reginhald  condemned by the man for whom he had proceeded to  such enormous guilt  was led away  in vain imploring mercy  urging the  unmerited severity of his fate  and gnashing his teeth in rage and  despair  Grey  from his place of concealment  was terrified with the  view of his brother in the agonies of death  and tortured with the fear  of becoming the next victim to the distracted violence of Raymond                  SECT  II     THE dreadful intelligence  now received  was speedily and fatally  confirmed to these wicked intruders  Heaven had graciously watched over  the Earl of Salisbury  and  with a wonderful hand  rescued him from the  brink of destruction  Just in that moment when the cup  poisoned by the  Monk  had reached and wet his lips  a sudden exclamation from Chauvigny  surprised and discomposed him  He started and withdrew the fatal  draught  The noise was loud in the hall  and the crowd encreased  his  eyes quickly encountered Les Roches rushing eagerly forward  the cup  fell from his hand  and he prest on with equal ardor to meet the  embraces of his long lost friend  They clung together in that tumult of  joy  which knows no words  and  when at length Les Roches found leisure to  turn to Chauvigny  the gentle youth  pressing him earnestly in his arms   compleated his happiness  by exclaiming  that Jacqueline too was safe   Nature was exhausted by these violent emotions  and Les Roches sunk down  upon a seat  breathless and silent  Again recovering  he cast his eyes  round  and survey d the well known countenances of his followers and  associates  the attendants of Chauvigny  and some of the brave  soldiers of Lord William  He started up  and pressed the hands of each   then again  turning to his two noble friends  again he gazed upon them  with eager joy  and again they renewed their embraces   Now   said the  Earl         I shall indeed return home in triumph  now are all my toils  my terrors  and dangers  amply recompensed        Then  resuming his seat at the table  he invited Les Roches to share in  their repast  and to allow some indulgence and refreshment to his  fatigue —      And hast thou  indeed  preserved my daughter         cried the Frenchman       Let me see her  let her father take the dear treasure to his arms  Is  she well  Is she at hand         —      Safely bestowed under the hospitable roof of this good Knight         replied William  and pointed to Randolph       The noble maid shall straight be summoned to meet thee  and soon shall  she share thy joy         —Thanks to the eternal goodness  replied Les Roches       that goodness which hath been pleased to unite us to each other by  mutual and repeated offices of friendship  Lo  for my daughter  I  present thee with a gist as precious         Then beckoning to one of his followers  who had entered with him  the  man retired  and soon returned  leading young William in his hand  who  flew to his father with tears of infant joy  The astonishment of the  Earl could scarcely allow him leisure to return the fond endearments of  his son  He looked wildly on his friend  and seemed to demand an  explanation of this wonder   Yes   said Les Roches       thou dost embrace thy son  rescued from danger  perhaps  from destruction —But be calm  Thou shall be satisfied  Hear then the  story of my fortunes  since I was last separated from thee  my dearest  Chauvigny  A few words will relate it all             Thou hast already heard  Lord William  how much I am indebted to this  noble youth  He hath informed thee  no doubt  of our preparations for  seeking thee in England  and of our adventure with the pirate who  attempted to seize our vessel  little suspecting that strength and  desperate resolution which soon taught him to consult his safety by a  precipitate flight  Just in that instant when the swelling waters had  separated our ships  and our enemies were crouding their sails  to  escape from that force which they had rashly provoked  their captain had  been borne down by the press  and lay at the feet of one of our brave
