going to bed I fell into a sound sleep  without being haunted in my dreams by those phantoms of flattering delusion which might have gained admittance with no severe question from a corruptible door keeper  The ambitious Scipio  on the contrary  tossed and tumbled all night in the agitation of restless contrivance  Whenever he dozed a little imp took possession of his brain  with a pen behind its ear  working out by all the rules of arithmetic the bulky sum total of his daughter Seraphina s marriage portion   No sooner had I got my clothes on the next morning  than a message came from his lordship  I flew like lightning at the summons  when his excellency said  Now then  Santillane  suppose you give us a specimen of your talents for business  You say that the Duke of Lerma used to give you state papers to bring into official form  and I have one  by way of experiment  on which you shall try your skill  The subject you will easily comprehend  it turns upon an exposition of public affairs  such as to throw an artificial light on the first appearance of the new ministry  and to prejudice the public in its favour  I have already whispered it about by my emissaries  that every department of the state was completely disorganized  that the talents which preceded us were no talents at all  and the object at present is to impress both court and city by a formal declaration with the idea  that our aid is absolutely necessary to save the monarchy itself from sinking  On this theme you may expatiate till the populace become lock jawed with astonishment  and the sober part of the public are gravely argued out of all prepossession in favour of the discarded party  By way of contrast  you will talk of the dignus vindice nodus  taking care to translate it into Spanish  and boast of the measures adopted under the new order of things  to secure the permanent glory of the king s reign  to give perpetual prosperity to his dominions  and to confer perfect  unchangeable happiness on his good people   His lordship  having given out the general subject of my thesis  left me with a paper containing the heads of charges  whether just or unjust  against the late administration  and I remember perfectly well  that there were ten articles  whose lightest word  even of the lightest article  would harrow up the soul of a true Spaniard  and make his knotted and combined locks to part  That the current of my fancy might experience no interruption  he shut me into a little closet near his own  where the spirit of poetry might possess me in all its freedom and in dependence  My best faculties were called forth  to compose a statement of affairs commensurate with my own concern in the sweeping of the new brooms  My first object was to lay open the nakedness and abandonment of the kingdom  the finances in a state of bankruptcy  the civil list and immediate resources of the crown pawned fifty times over  the navy unpaid  dismantled  and in mutiny  All this hideous delineation was referred for its justice and accuracy to the wrong headedness and stupidity of government at the close of the last reign  and the doctrine most strongly enforced  that unexampled wisdom and patriotism only could ward off the fatal consequences  In short  the monarchy could only be sustained on the shoulders of our political sufficiency and reforming prudence  The ex ministry were so cruelly belaboured  that the Duke of Lerma s ruin  according to the terms of my syllogism  was the salvation of Spain  To own the truth  though my professions were in the spirit of Christian charity towards that nobleman  I was not sorry to give him a sly rub in the exercise of my function  Oh man  man  what a compound of candour  breathing satire and splenetic impartiality art thou   Towards the conclusion  having finished my frightful portraiture of overhanging evils  I endeavoured to allay the storm my art had raised by making futurity as bright as the past had been gloomy  The Count of Olivarez was brought in at the close  like the tutelary deity of an ancient commonwealth in the crisis of its fate  I promised more than paganism ever feigned or chivalry fancied in the wildest of its crusading projects  In a word  I so exactly executed what the new minister meant  that he seemed not to know his own hints again  when drawn out in my emphatic and appropriate language  Santillane  said he  do you know that this is more like the composition one might expect from a secretary of state  than like that of a private secretary  I can no longer be surprised that the Duke of Lerma was fond of calling your talents into action  Your style is concise  and by no means inelegant  but it creeps rather too much in the level paths of nature  At the same time  pointing out the passages which did not hit his fancy  he corrected them  and I gathered from the touches he threw in  that Navarro was right in saying he affected sententious wit  but mistook for it quaint and stale conceits  Nevertheless  though he preferred the stately  or rather the grotesque in writing  he suffered two thirds of my performance to stand without alteration
