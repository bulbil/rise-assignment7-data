dear Charlotte  be good  Let me beseech you be good  If you are not  you will have every one of my friends who met you at Dunstable  and  from their report  my grandmamma and Nancy  against you  for they find but one fault in my Lord  It is  that he seems too fond of a Lady  who  by her archness of looks  and half saucy turns upon him  even before them  evidently shewed—Shall I say what  But I stand up for you  my dear  Your gratitude  your generosity  your honour  I say   and why should I not add your duty   will certainly make you one of the most obliging of wives  to the most affectionate of husbands   My uncle says  He hopes so  But tho  he adores   225 you for a friend  and the companion of a lively hour  yet he does not know but his Dame Selby is still the woman whom a man should prefer for a wife  And she  said he  is full as saucy as a wife need to be  tho  I think  Harriet  that she has not been the less dutiful of late for your absence   Once more  adieu  my dear Lady G  and continue to love  Your HARRIET BYRON   LETTER XXXIII  Lady G  To Miss BYRON    Thursday  April 27   EVERY one of the Dunstable party say  that you are a grateful and good girl  Beauchamp can talk of nobody else of our Sex  I believe in my conscience he is in Love with you  I think all the unprovided for young women where ever you come must hate you  Was you never by surprize carried into the chamber of a friend labouring with the Smallpox  in the infectious stage of it —O but I think you once said you had had that distemper  But your mind  Harriet  were your face to be ruined  would make you admirers  The fellows who could think of preferring even such a face to such a heart  may be turned over to the class of insignificants   Is not your aunt Selby  you ask  an excellent woman —She is  I admire her  But I am very angry with you for deferring to another time  acquainting me with what she said of me  When we are taken with any body  we love they should be taken with us  Teazing Harriet  You know what an immoderate quantity of curiosity I have  Never serve me so again   I am in Love with your cousin Lucy  Were either Fenwick or Greville good enough—But they are not   226 I think she shall have Mr  Orme  Nancy  you say  is such another good girl  I don t doubt it  Is she not your cousin  and Lucy s sister  But I cannot undertake for every good girl who wants a husband  I wish I had seen Lucy a fortnight ago  Then Nancy might have had Mr  Orme  and Lucy should have had Lord G  He admires her greatly  And do you think that a man who at that time professed for me so much Love and Service  and all that  would have scrupled to oblige me  had I  as I easily should  proved to him  that he would have been a much happier man than he could hope to be with Somebody else   Your uncle is a pleasant man  But tell him I say  that the man would be out of his wits  that did not make the preference he does in favour of his Dame Selby  as he calls her  Tell him also  if you please  in return for his plain dealing  that I say  he studies too much for his pleasantries  He is continually hunting for occasions to be smart  I have heard my father say  that this was the fault of some wits of his acquaintance  whom he ranked among the wit lings for it  If you think it will mortify him more  you may tell him  for I am very revengeful when I think myself affronted  that were I at liberty  which  God help me  I am not  I would sooner choose for a husband the man I have  poor soul  as I now and then think him  than such a teazing creature as himself  were both in my power  and both of an age  And I should have this good reason for my preference  Your uncle and I should have been too much alike  and so been jealous of each other s wit  whereas I can make my honest Lord G  look about him  and admire me strangely  whenever I please   But I am  it seems  a person of a particular character  Every one  you say  loves me  yet blames me  Odd characters  my dear  are needful to make even characters shine  You good girls would not be valued as you are  if there were not bad ones  Have   227 you not heard it said  That all human excellence is but comparative  Pray allow of the contrast  You  I am sure  ought  You are an ungrateful creature  if
