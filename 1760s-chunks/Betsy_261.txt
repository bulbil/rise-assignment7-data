and went out of the room       She attempted not to call him back  but retired to her chamber  in order   to give a loose to passions more turbulent than she had ever known   before                CHAPTER VI       Contains a second matrimonial contest  of worse consequence than the   former          Whoever considers Miss Betsy Thoughtless in her maiden character  will   not find it difficult to conceive what she now endured in that of Mrs    Munden  All that lightened her poor heart  all that made her patiently   submit to the fate her brothers had  in a manner  forced upon her  was a   belief of her being passionately loved by the man she made her husband    but thus cruelly undeceived by the treatment she had just met with from   him  one may truly say  that if it did not make her utterly hate and   despise him  it at least destroyed at once  in her  all the respect and   good will she had  from the first moment of her marriage  been   endeavouring to feel for him       It is hard to say whether her surprize at an eclaircissement she had so   little expected  her indignation at Mr  Munden s mean attempt to   encroach upon her right  or the shock of reflecting  that it was by   death alone she could be relieved from the vexations with which she was   threatened by a man of his humour  were most predominant in her soul    but certain it is  that all together racked her with most terrible   convulsions       She was in the midst of these agitations  when Lady Trusty came to visit   her  In the distraction of these thoughts she had forgot to give orders   to be denied to all company  which otherwise she would doubtless have   done  even without excepting that dear and justly valued friend       She endeavoured  as much as possible  to compose herself  and prevent   all tokens of discontent from appearing in her countenance  but had not   the power of doing it effectually enough to deceive the penetration of   that lady  she immediately perceived that something extraordinary had   happened to her  and  as soon as she was seated  began to enquire into   the cause of the change she had observed in her       Mrs  Munden  on considering what was most prudent in a wife  from the   first moment of her becoming so  had absolutely resolved always to   adhere  as strictly as possible  to this maxim of the poet             Secrets of marriage should be sacred held        Their sweets and bitters by the wife conceal d        But finding herself pretty strongly pressed by a lady to whom she had   the greatest and most just reason to believe she ought to have nothing   in reserve  she hesitated not long to relate to her the whole story of   the brul√©e she had with her husband       Lady Trusty was extremely alarmed at the account given her  and because   she would be sure not to mistake any part of it  made Mrs  Munden repeat   several times over every particular of this unhappy dispute  then  after   a pause of some minutes  began to give her advice to her fair friend in   the following terms        It grieves me to the soul   said that excellent lady   to find there is   already any matter of complaint between you  you have been but two   months married  and it is  methinks  by much too early for him to throw   off the lover  and exert the husband  but since it is so  I would not   have you  for your own sake  too much exert the wife  I fear he is of a   rugged nature  it behoves you  therefore  rather to endeavour to soften   it  by all the means in your power  than to pretend to combat with   unequal force  you know the engagements you are under  and how little   relief all the resistance you can make will be able to afford you         Bless me  Madam   cried Mrs  Munden  spiritously   would your ladyship   have me give up  to the expence of housekeeping  that slender pittance   allowed for cloaths and pocket money in my marriage articles         No  my dear   cried Lady Trusty   far be it from me to give you any   such counsel  on the contrary  I am apprehensive that  if you should   suffer yourself to be
