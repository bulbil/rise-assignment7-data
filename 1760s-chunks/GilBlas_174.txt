wishes  looking at my charms through the magnifying medium of delay and disappointment  came back again in crowds to encounter new caprices  to say nothing of a thousand fresh hearts  ready to bargain on the mere report of my being to let  I had never been so exclusively the mode  Of all the men who put in for being cajoled by me  a portly German  belonging to the Duke of Ossuna s household  seemed to bid highest  Not that his personal attractions were by any means the most catching  but then there were a thousand amiable pistoles on the list of candidates  scraped together by perquisites in his master s service  and turned adrift with the prodigality of a prince  in the hope of becoming my favoured lover  This fat pigeon to be plucked was by name Brutandorf  As long as his pockets were lined  his reception was warm  empty purses meet with fastened doors  The principles on which my friendship rested were not altogether to his taste  He came to the play to look after me during the performance  I was behind the scenes  It was his humour to load me with reproaches  it was mine to laugh in his face  This provoked his boorish wrath  and he gave me a box on the ear  like a clumsy  fisted German as he was  I set up a loud scream  the business of the stage was suspended  I came forward to the front  and  addressing the Duke of Ossuna  who was at the play on that occasion with his lady duchess  begged his protection from the German gallantry of his establishment  The duke gave orders for our proceeding with the piece  and intimated that he would hear the parties after the curtain had dropped  At the conclusion of the play I presented myself in all the dreary pomp of tragedy before the duke  and laid open my griefs in all the majesty of woe  As for my German pugilist  his defence was on a level with his provocation  so far from being sorry for what he had done  his fingers itched to give me another dressing  The cause being heard pro and con  the Duke of Ossuna said to his Scandinavian savage  Brutandorf I dismiss you from my service  and beg never to see anything more of you  not because you have given a box on the ear to an actress  but for your failure in respect to your master and mistress  in having presumed to interrupt the progress of the play in their presence   This decision was a bitter pill for me to swallow  It was high treason against my histrionic majesty  that the German was not turned off on the ground of having insulted me  It seemed difficult to conceive the possibility of a greater crime than that of insulting a principal actress  and where crimes are parallel  punishments should tally  The retribution in this case would have been exemplary  and I expected no less  This unpleasant occurrence undeceived me  and proved  to my mortification  that the public distinguished between the actors and the personages they may chance to enact  On this conviction  my pride revolted at the theatre  I resolved to give up my engagements to go and live at a distance from Madrid  I fixed on the city of Valencia for the place of my retreat  and went thither under a feigned character  with a property of twenty thousand ducats in money and jewels  a sum in my mind more than sufficient to maintain me for the remainder of my days  since it was my purpose to lead a retired life  I rented a small house at Valencia  and limited my establishment to a female servant and a page  who were as ignorant of my birth  parentage  and education  as the rest of the town  I gave myself out for the widow of an officer belonging to the king s household  and intimated that I had made choice of Valencia for my residence  on the report that it was one of the most agreeable neighbourhoods in Spain  I saw very little company  and maintained so reserved a deportment  that there never was the slightest suspicion of my having been an actress  Yet  not withstanding all the pains I took to hide myself from the garish eye of day  I had worse success against the piercing ken of a gentleman  who had a country seat near Paterna  He was of an ancient family  in person genteel and manly  from five and thirty to forty years of age  nobly connected  but scandalously in debt  a contradiction in the vocabulary of honour  neither more unaccountable nor uncommon in the kingdom of Valencia  than what takes place every day in other parts of the civilized world   This gentleman of a generation or two before the present  finding my person to his liking  was desirous of knowing if in other respects I was a commodity for his market  He set every engine at work to inquire into the most minute particulars  and had the pleasure to learn from general report  that I was a warm widow with a comfortable jointure  and a person little  if anything  the worse for wear  It struck him that this was just the match  so that in a very short time an old lady came to my house  telling
