Olivarez  having been informed that every morning  whether in summer or winter  he gave audience by candlelight to all comers  I ensconced myself modestly in a corner of the saloon  and from my lurking place took especial notice of the count when he made his appearance  for I had marked his person but cursorily in the king s closet  He was above the middle stature  and might pass for fat in a country where it is a rarity to see any but lean subjects  His shoulders were so high  as to look exactly as if he was hump backed  but appearances were slanderous  for his blade bones  though inelegant  were a pair  his head  which was large enough to he capacious  dropped down upon his chest by the unwieldiness of its own weight  his hair was black and unconscious of a curl  his face lengthened  his complexion olive coloured  his mouth retiring inwards  with the sharp pointed  turn up chin of a pantaloon   This whole arrangement of structure and symmetry did not exactly make up the complete model of a nobleman according to the ideas of ancient art  nevertheless  as I believed him to be in a temper of mind favourable to the gratification of my wishes  I looked at his defects with an indulgent eye  and found him a man very much to my satisfaction  One of the best points about him was  that he received the public at large with the utmost affability and complacency  holding out his hand for petitions with as much good humour as if he were the person to be obliged  and this was a sufficient set off against anything untoward in the expression of his countenance  In the mean time  when in my turn I came forward to pay my respects and make myself known to him  he darted at me a glance of rude dislike and frightful menace  then turning his back  without condescending to give me audience  retired into his closet  Then it was that the ugliness of this nobleman s features appeared in all the extravagance of caricature  so that I made the best of my way out of the saloon  thunder struck at so savage a reception  and quite at a loss how to conjecture what might be the consequence   Having got back to Scipio  who was waiting for me at the door    Can you guess at all  said I  what sort of a greeting mine was  No  answered he  not as to the minute particulars  but with respect to the substance  easily enough  the minister  ready upon all occasions to fall in with the fancies of his royal master  must of course have made you a handsome offer of an ostensible and lucrative situation  That is all you know about the matter  replied I  and then went on to acquaint him circumstantially with all that passed  He listened to me with serious attention  and then said    The count could not have recollected your person  or rather  he must have been deceived by a fortuitous resemblance between you and some impertinent suitor  I would advise you to try another interview  I will lay a wager he will look on you more kindly  I adopted my secretary s suggestion  and stood for a second time in the presence of the minister  but he  behaving to me still worse than at first  puckered up his features the moment my unlucky countenance came within his ken  just as if it was connected with some lodged hate and certain loathing  which of force swayed him to offend  himself being offended  after this significant demonstration  he turned away his glaring eyeballs  and withdrew without uttering a word   I was stung to the quick by so hostile a treatment  and in a humour to set out immediately on my return to Valencia  but to that project Scipio uniformly opposed his steady objections  not knowing how for the life of him to part with those flattering hopes which fancy had engendered in his brain  Do you not see plainly  said I  that the count wishes to drive me away from court  The monarch has testified in his presence some sort of favourable intention towards me  and is not that enough to draw down upon me the thorough hatred of the monarch s favourite  Let us drive before the wind  my good comrade  let us make up our minds to put quietly into port  and leave the open sea and the honours of the flag in the possession of an enemy with whom we are too feeble to contend  Sir  answered he  in high resentment against the Count of Olivarez  I would not strike so easily  I would go and complain to the king of the contempt in which his minister held his recommendation  Bad advice  indeed  my friend  said I  to take so imprudent a step as that  would soon bring bitter repentance in the train of its consequences  I do not even know whether it is safe for me to remain any longer in this town   At this hint  my secretary communed a little with his own thoughts  and  considering that in point of fact we had to do with a man who kept the key of the tower of Segovia in his pocket  my fears became naturalized in his breast
