as a new risen   phoenix  suspended and glittering in the air  and then alighting as   winged on the other side      The elements were rent by an universal shout  which followed   and undulated after our company till they sheltered themselves   within the house      The Fieldings then arrived with the Keverend Mr  Catharines    who was appointed to join the noble pair      After breakfast the carriages were ordered out  First  Mr  Clinton   and Mr  Meekly moved away in the former s coach and four to the   church  The family of the Fieldings then followed in a coach and   four  Next went Clement and his Arabella in their post chaise and   pair  The duke and duchess then succeeded  in a sumptuous coach         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  427     proudly drawn by six German greys  attended by a long retinue of   French liveries  and the duchess s women in a coach and four    And last of all came our hero and his Abenaide  enthroned in her   open chariot   her four spotted Arabians  restraining their impatience    beat measures with their feet  scarce seeming to advance the pace   of a tortoise      Harry s page closed the rear  mounted on his lord s charger  who   stepped foaming behind the chariot   and the long cavalcade nearly   reached from the great hotel to the entrance of the town      The crowd  however  extended wide and far beyond the cavalcade    They bowed respectfully  and paid obeisance to Mr  Clinton  the   duke   c   as they passed   but  as soon as they got a glimpse of   the chariot of their young Phaeton  their acclamations became   unremitted  and almost insufferable to the ear  like the shouts of a   Persian army at the rising of the sun      Slowly as our Harry moved  the multitude strove to retard him    by throwing themselves in his way  that they might satiate their   eyes and souls with the fulness of the sight  Bended knees and   lifted hands  prayers  blessings  and exclamations  were heard and   seen on all sides   and all the way as they went  hundreds upon   hundreds shouted forth the hymeneal of the young and happy pair          THE END
