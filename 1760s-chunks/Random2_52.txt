whom it was given  with directions to carry it to the house of a rich gentleman in the neighbourhood  whither he  Strap  followed him  and saw it put into the hands of a waiting woman  who paid the messenger and shut the door —That upon inquiry at an ale house hard by  where he called for a pint of beer  he understood  that the gentleman to whom the house belonged had an only daughter  very handsome  who would inherit his whole estate  and who certainly was the author of the billet I had received —I was of the same opinion  and huging myself in the happy prospect  dressed immediately  and passed in great state by the house that contained my unknown admirer —Nor was my vanity disappointed  for I perceived a beautiful young creature standing at one of the windows of the dining room  who  I imagined  observed me with more than common curiosity  That I might indulge her view  and at the same time feast my own  I affected to stop  and give orders to Strap  in the street  just opposite to her station  by which means I had an opportunity of seeing her more distinctly  and of congratulating myself on having made a conquest of so much perfection    150 —In a few moments she retired  and I betook myself to the ordinary  in a rapture of hope  which deprived me of my appetite for that meal  and sent me home in the evening to indulge my contemplation     Early next day  I was favoured with another epistle from my unknown charmer  signifying her unutterable joy at the receipt of mine  which  while it made a tender of my heart  convinced her of the value of it  Above all things  she professed extreme pleasure in finding me so much attached to her understanding  a circumstance that not only flattered her in the most sensible part  but at the same time argued my own sagacity —As for the interview I desired  she assured me  that I could not be more eager for such an occasion than she  but she must not only sacrifice a little more to decorum  but be satisfied of my honourable intentions  before she would grant that request  Mean while  she gave me to understand  that although she might owe some deference to the opinion of certain persons  she was resolved  in an affair that so nearly concerned her happiness  to consult her own inclination  preferably to the advice of the whole world  especially  as she was urged to such condescension by no consideration of fortune  what she depended upon  being her own without restriction or controul —Struck with admiration at the philosophy and selfdenial of my mistress  who seemed insensible of the beauty she possessed  and in particular  ravished with that piece of intelligence  by which I learned her fortune was independent  I resumed the pen  launched out into encomiums on the dignity of her sentiments  affected to undervalue the charms of external beauty  pretended to   151 ground my passion on the qualities of her mind  complained of her rigour  in sacrificing my repose to an overscrupulous regard to decorum  and declared the purity of my designs in the most solemn and pathetic vows —This performance being sealed and directed  was sent to the place appointed  by Strap  who  that we might be still the more confirmed in our belief  renewed his watch  and in a little time brought back the same information as before  with this addition  that Miss Sparkle   the name of my supposed correspondent  looking out at the window  no sooner saw the messenger arrive  than she shut the casement in a sort of beautiful confusion  and disappeared  eager  no doubt  to hear from the dear object of her love   My doubts now vanished  the long expected port appeared  and I looked upon myself as perfectly secure of that happiness I had been in quest of so long —After dinner  I sauntered in company with doctor Wagtail  to that part of the town in which my inamorata lived  and as he was a meer register  enquired of him into the name  character and fortune of every body who possessed a good house in the streets through which we passed  When it came to his turn to mention Sir John Sparkle  he represented him as a man of an immense estate and narrow disposition  who mewed up his only child  a fine young lady  from the conversation of mankind  under the strict watch and inspection of an old gouvernante  who was either so honest  envious or insatiable  that no body had been  as yet  able to make her a friend  or get access to her charge  though numbers attempted it every day  not so much on account of her expectations from her father    152 who being a widower  might marry again  and have sons  as for a fortune of twelve thousand pounds left her by an uncle  of which she could not be deprived —This piece of news exactly tallying with the last part of the letter I had been honoured with in the morning  had such an effect on me  that any man  except Wagtail  might have observed my emotion  but his attention was too much engrossed on the
