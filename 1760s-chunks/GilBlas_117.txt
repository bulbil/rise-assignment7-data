went to the monarch s heart like the stab of an assassin  Constance  who had a nearer interest than any human being in the result  from the double motive of glory and personal affection  laid hold of this opportunity for expressing her gratitude  The prince had much ado to keep his feelings within bounds  He received the compliment of the princess with so constrained an air  and evinced so unusual a disorder in his behaviour  as scarcely to reply in a manner suited to the common forms of good breeding  At last  no longer master of his violent passions  he went up to Siffredi  whom the formalities of his office detained near the royal person  and said to him in a low tone of voice    What is the meaning of all this  Leontio  The signature which I deposited in your daughter s hands was not meant for such a use as this  You are guilty of          My liege  interrupted Siffredi again with a tone of firmness  look to your own glory  If you refuse to comply with the injunctions of the king  your uncle  you lose the crown of Sicily  No sooner had he thrown in this salutary hint  than he got away from the king  to prevent all possibility of a reply  Enriquez was left in a most embarrassing situation  A thousand opposite emotions agitated him at once  He was exasperated against Siffredi  to give up Blanche was more than he could endure  so that  balancing between his private feelings and the calls of public honour  he was doubtful to which side he should incline  At length his doubts were resolved  under the idea of having found the means to secure Siffredi s daughter  without giving up his claim to the throne  He affected therefore an entire submission to the will of Roger  in the hope  while a dispensation from his marriage with his cousin was soliciting at Rome  of gaining the leading nobility by his largesses  and thus establishing his power so firmly  as not to be under the necessity of fulfilling the conditions of the obnoxious instrument   After forming this design  he got to be more composed  and turning towards Constance  confirmed to her what the lord high chancellor had read in presence of the whole assembly  But  at the very moment when he had so far betrayed himself as to pledge his faith  Blanche arrived in the hall of council  She came thither  by her father s command  to pay her duty to the princess  and her ears  on entering  were startled at the expressions of Enriquez  In addition to this shock  Leontio  determined not to leave her in doubt of her misfortune  accompanied her presentation to Constance with these words  Daughter  make your homage acceptable to your queen  call down upon her the blessings of a prosperous reign and a happy marriage  This terrible blow overwhelmed the unfortunate Blanche  Vain were all her attempts to suppress her anguish  her countenance changed successively from the deepest blush to a deadly paleness  and she trembled from head to foot  And yet the princess had no suspicion how the matter really stood  but attributed the confused style of her compliment to the awkwardness of a young person brought up in a state of rustication  and totally unacquainted with the manners of a court  But the young king was more in the secret  The sight of Blanche put him out of countenance  and the despair  too legible in her eyes  was enough to drive him out of his senses  Her feelings were not to be misunderstood  and they pointed at him as the most faithless of men  Could he have spoken to her  it might have tranquillized his agitation  but how to lay hold of the happy moment  when all Sicily  at least the illustrious part of it  was fixed in anxious expectation on his proceedings  Besides  the stern and inflexible Siffredi extinguished at once every ray of hope  This minister  who was at no loss to decipher the hearts of the two lovers  and was firmly resolved  if possible  to prevent the evil consequences impending over the state from the violence of this imprudent attachment  got his daughter out of the assembly with the dexterity of a practised courtier  and regained the road to Belmonte with her in his possession  determined  for more reasons than one  to marry her as soon as possible   When they reached home  he gave her to understand all the horror of her destiny  by announcing his promise to the constable  Just heaven  exclaimed she  transported into a paroxysm of despair  which her father s presence could not restrain  what unparalleled sufferings have you the cruelty to lay up in store for the ill  fated Blanche  Her agony went to such a degree of violence as to suspend every power of her soul  Her limbs seemed as if stiffened under the icy grasp of death  Cold and pale  she fell senseless into her father s arms  Neither was he insensible to her melancholy condition  Yet  feeling as he did all the alarm and anxiety of a parent  the stern inflexibility of the statesman remained unshaken  Blanche  after a time  was recalled to life and feeling  rather by
