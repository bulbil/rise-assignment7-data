oblige her  and delight in obliging her  that she must rack   her invention for trials of your goodness  and knows not when she s   happy   O my dearest sir  added I  less than one half of the favours   you have so generously conferred upon me  would have exceeded my utmost   wishes       My dear angel  said he  and kissed me again  I shall be troublesome   to you with my kisses  if you continue thus sweetly obliging in your   actions and expressions  O sir  said I  I have been thinking  as I was   dressing myself  what excellent lessons you teach me       When you commanded me  at your table to cheer the doubting mind and   comfort the uneasy heart  and to behave most kindly to those who have   least reason to expect it  and are most inferior  how sweetly  in every   instance that could possibly occur  have you done this yourself by your   poor  unworthy Pamela  till you have diffused  in your own dear words    ease  pleasure  and tranquillity  around my glad heart       Then again  sir  when you bid me not be disturbed by little accidents    or by strangers coming in upon me unexpectedly  how noble an instance   did you give me of this  when  on our happy wedding day  the coming of   Sir Charles Hargrave  and the other two gentlemen   for which you were   quite unprovided  and which hindered our happiness of dining together on   that chosen day   did not so disturb you  but that you entertained the   gentlemen pleasantly  and parted with them civilly and kindly  What   charming instances are these  I have been recollecting with pleasure  of   your pursuing the doctrine you deliver       My dear  said he  these observations are very kind in you  and much to   my advantage  But if I do not always  for I fear these were too much   accidents  so well pursue the doctrines I lay down  my Pamela must not   expect that my imperfections will be a plea for her nonobservance of my   lessons  as you call them  for  I doubt I shall never be half so perfect   as you  and so I cannot permit you to recede in your goodness  though I   may find myself unable to advance as I ought in my duty       I hope  sir  said I  by God s grace  I never shall  I believe it  said   he  but I only mention this  knowing my own defects  lest my future   lessons should not be so well warranted by my practice  as in the   instances you have kindly recollected       He was pleased to take notice of my dress  and spanning my waist with   his hands  said  What a sweet shape is here  It would make one regret to   lose it  and yet  my beloved Pamela  I shall think nothing but that loss   wanting  to complete my happiness   I put my bold hand before his mouth    and said  Hush  hush  O fie  sir   The freest thing you have ever yet   said  since I have been yours   He kissed my hand  and said  Such an   innocent wish  my dearest  may be permitted me  because it is the end   of the institution   But say  Would such a case be unwelcome to my   Pamela   I will say  sir  said I  and hid my blushing face on his bosom    that your wishes  in every thing  shall be mine  but  pray  sir  say no   more  He kindly saluted me  and thanked me  and changed the subject   I   was not too free  I hope       Thus we talked  till we heard the coaches  and then he said  Stay here    in the garden  my dear  and I ll bring the company to you  And when   he was gone  I passed by the back door  kneeled down against it  and   blessed God for not permitting my then so much desired escape  I went   to the pond  and kneeled down on the mossy bank  and again blessed God   there  for his mercy in my escape from myself  my then worst enemy    though I thought I had none but enemies  and no friend near me  And so I   ought to do in almost every step of this garden  and every room in this   house   And I was bending my steps to the dear little chapel  to make my   acknowledgment there  but I saw the company coming towards me       Miss
