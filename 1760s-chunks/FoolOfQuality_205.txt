good will to all men  If you have any sins to   account for  they must be covered tenfold by the multitude of your   charities      Talk not  Harry  said he  of the filthy rags of my own righteous    ness  I am far from the confidence of the boastful Pharisee   alas     I have not even that of the poor and humble publican  for I dare   not look up to say    Lord  be merciful to me  a sinner     wherefore    then  do you speak of having finished my course toward God and   toward man   It is but lately  very lately  that I set out upon it    and I am cut short before I have got within sight of the goal    Yes  Harry  I fear  I know  I feel  that there is no salvation for me      You amaze me  sir  said I   you terrify me to death   If there is   not salvation for such as you  what a depth of perdition opens for   the rest of mankind       I would you could convince me  he cried  I want to be com    forted   I desire comfort  any kind of consolation   but I feel my   condemnation within myself  Moreover  I see every text of the   gospel of the words of life terribly marshalled and set in broad   array against me  What text  sir   said I   I am sure I know of no   texts that bring terror or condemnation to the just  Ah  Harry     he replied  justice is of the law and the circumcision  and has   nothing to do with the new covenant or the new man  For what   says the great apostle   Circumcision availeth nothing  neither   uncircumcision  but a new creature   And Christ himself hath   said    Except a man be born again  he cannot see the kingdom of   God   Again the same apostle saith   I delight in the law of God   after the inward man    and again    My little children  of whom I   travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you   Now if all   these corresponding expressions of being   born again  a new   creature  a new man  an inward man  Christ formed in us    c     are to be glossed and explained away  as meaning little more than   a state of moral sentiments and moral behaviour  there can be   nothing of real import in the gospel of Christ      p         210 TEE FOOL OF QUALITY      Again  hear what the Kedeemer gaith    Except ye be converted   and become as little children  ye shall not enter into the kingdom   of heaven   Again    If any man will come after me  let him deny   himself and take up his cross and follow me   Again    Whosoever   he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath  he cannot be my   disciple       If these things  I cried  are to be taken according to the apparent   sense and import of the letter  neither the teachers of the gospel    nor those who are taught  can be saved      Therefore  replied he  it is said  that   Many be called  but few   chosen   And again    Enter ye in at the strait gate   for wide is   the gate  and broad is the way  that leadeth to destruction  and   many there be which go in thereat   because strait is the gate  and   narrow is the way  which leadeth unto life  and few there be that   find it   O my Harry  my Harry   our lives have been employed   in seeking and  loving the world  and the things of the world     therefore   the love of the Father could not be in us   that I   had never been born   O thou God   whose tribunal at this hour is   set up so tremendously against me  at length I feel the propriety   of thy precepts  in rejecting the world and all that is therein   for   what can they yield save a little food and raiment to bodily cor    ruption  or incitements to that pride which cast Lucifer into a gulf    that now opens before me without a bottom       As I trembled and had nothing to answer  I proposed to bring   some of our clergy to him  No  Harry   no  says he
