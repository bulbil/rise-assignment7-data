 who has given us such a Self Conviction of the Pleasures of Hereafter  as may make us rest in Hope  but restrained us from such a Sense of them  as might render us impatient in our Wishes   Farewell   my Love  my Friend  my Oracle   Henry   Page  17  LETTER CLXXXVI  FRANCES to HENRY   WHAT a Scene of tranquil Happiness does my dear practic Philosopher s Letter present me with  How earnestly  how passionately do I wish to share those rational Delights  which he can  at once  partake and inspire  How  altogether preferable  should I think it  to be seated by him on an Hillock of Hay  contemplating the Works of Nature  while he deduced each obvious Effect from it s first great Principle  and made me lose all Wonder  in Praise and Gratitude to that Almighty Being  who first created  and then made him mine   I say  how much should I prefer that happy Situation to a Throne  without thee  thou dearest and most charming of thy Sex  Nor will I doubt  that my sharing would enhance the Pleasures of Retirement  for Solitude s the Nurse of Love  as well as Contemplation  and I am very sure  were we to live but a few Months in a calm settled Way together  you would be infinitely fonder of me than you are  or can be  at present  as I make no doubt but we should then experience the charming Theory you have somewhere laid down    Chearfulness without Mirth  Gravity without Spleen  and Page  18 the warmest Love with the highest Esteem   —You will  perhaps  be surprized  when I tell you  that I now rejoice at what I have sometimes looked on as the greatest Misfortune of my Life  that we have not lived together  We should have been miserable  if that had happened two Years ago  It is but a very short Time  since I became thoroughly acquainted with you  That Knowledge has increased my Love and Esteem for you  You have introduced me to myself  Need I say  that  by knowing myself  I have triumphed over my greatest Foible  And sure I cannot err greatly  after your pointing out my Faults  when I declare  in the Sincerity of my Heart  that I have no Will of my own  nor Wish  but that of rendering my little Self agreeable to you —If it were not a Work of Supererogation  I could even wish that I had greater Failings to surmount  as they would be a still stronger Proof of your Love and mine     Though I remember the Subject of each particular Letter you mention in Pliny  I will not pretend to speak my Sentiments  as I have not the Books by me  if I had  I should certainly start Objections  for the Pleasure of being refuted by you   I have not been at the Rock these ten Days  I have lain in Bond Street since I came to Town  and am almost killed with Raking  I shall not Page  19 leave London  till Kitty does  I know you will be a little angry with this Account of myself   till you recollect  that I have not seen her for some Months  and that the greatest Part of our Conversation is about you  which being a Subject I shall never be weary of  I cannot think of quitting it without Reluctance   With your s I received a long Letter from Lady —  I think  according to your Definition of it  the Letter O is much better adapted to her than to me  for she is  indeed  the Center of female Perfection  By her Desire  I inclose you Lord — s Letter  Nothing can be more elegant than your Sentiments  with Regard to her Intentions to serve you   I am vastly anxious to know what you have determined about Belvidere —Kitty is tearing the Pen out of my Hand  When shall I be able to write  or converse with you  sans Interruption  I can no longer withstand the Riot round me  but  though they force my Hand away  my Heart is unalterably your s   Frances   Page  20  LETTER CLXXXVII   Dear FANNY   AS the Post for this Day is not come in  I do not know yet  whether you leave Town To morrow or no  therefore I shall write to you  because I would not spare myself any Trouble certain  for even the Chance of giving you a Quarter of an Hour s Amusement   I met with a small Treatise Yesterday  intitled   On the Employment of Time   It is wrote by Gilbert West  I think it is very well collected  for  indeed  it is mostly a Heap of Quotations  and shews more of Learning than Understanding  For a Work of this Kind almost any Man may compile  who reads with a Common place Book by him   Young  the Satirist  has two very severe Lines against Quotations  which  for that Reason  I shall not recite  and there is certainly nothing so tiresome to the Reader as Writings of that Kind  which are only to be admitted in Works
