inconsistencies   of despair  I will be brief   I will not trespass on thy precious   time        He paused then a moment  till a flood of tears eased the fulness   of his heart  and then proceeded thus   â€”       In the irruption of thy troops into Bohemia  about six months   ago  my unhappy fortune led a party of them to my house  where   the industry of my ancestors  for ages of peace  fell a sacrifice to   the wantonness of unrestrained devastation in one moment  But   I complain not of this   it was my share of the indiscriminate   calamity  Alas   my woes are of another nature        The beauty of my wife struck the very hardened hearts of the   soldiers with such reverence that  in the fury of their outrage  they   dared not to lay a sacrilegious hand on her   but this safeguard   that protected her from rapine only raised the more audacious rage   of lust against her  The oflBcer who commanded the party no   sooner saw her than  inflamed with brutal desire  he hurried her   away with him to the camp  where imagination sinks in horror   from the thought of what she may have suffered  The news of my   misfortune soon reached me  No restraints of military duty were   of force to hold me a moment  I flew to the scene of my ruin    where  having learned what I have already related to you  the         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 236     greatness of my grief stupefied me for a time  till the thought of my   â  wife s being still alive  and in the possession of her ravisher  roused   me to a resolution of labouring for her relief  I therefore immedi    ately entered in disguise into those very troops which had perpe    trated my ruin  as I despaired of eluding the vigilance of thy officers   by any other means  My stratagem had success  I soon learned   that the officer who had brought my wife from my house had been   obliged to give her up to his general  who had demanded her as   soon as she had been brought to the camp        A dawn of hope broke in upon me  though I could not gain any   account of her after this  I thought that a man  honoured with   your particular esteem  must be possessed of virtue  and this  I   knew  must be her protection        Big vrith this hope  I found means to rejoin my own corps    where my absence was easily excused to a general who was my   friend  and who readily yielded to my request of sending a trumpet    with a letter  to inquire for such a lady  and to desire that she might   be treated vrith the tenderness and respect due to her sex and   beauty  till she should be restored to her friends  But all my fond   hopes fell to the ground when an answer was returned that the   general knew not of such a person  Despair now stared me in the   face   I saw all the horrors of my condition  and would that instant   have returned in my disguise and stabbed the ravisher at the head   of his forces  had I not reflected that my Theodora might be only   exposed by such an action to new insults  and her life  perhaps    sacrificed in torture and ignominy to revenge        While I fluctuated in this distress  Heaven inspired me with the   thought of having recourse to your justice  Though he is the   enemy of my sovereign  said I  he is a man who feels the tender   impulse of humanity   he is a king who delights in justice  I   therefore reassumed my disguise  and entered into your camp as   a deserter the night before this battle  in which instinctive abhor    rence of cowardice urged me to do the duty of a soldier   and I   happened to fight near your person  where  though I was sensible   of my crime in assisting the enemy of my sovereign  I had this   palliative consolation that the forces I engaged were not my fellow    subjects  but those of a perfidious ally  who entered into the war   only to take his own advantage  when a proper opportunity should   ofEer        This  gracious king  is my unhappy story  This is the griev    ance for which I implore thy justice  for which I fought against the   allies of my sovereign yesterday  for which I threw myself before   your horse s feet this morning  for which I now call upon you by
