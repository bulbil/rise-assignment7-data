 The valet  who was naturally of a hot fiery disposition  having had some words with one of the footmen   80 a blackamoor  the Indian  out of revenge for having been 〈…〉 by our heroine s new lover  determ••••〈◊〉 acquaint his master with the 〈◊〉 which was carrying on between his fellow servant and Miss ELLIOT  which he did  exaggerating the most minute circumstance to the highest aggravation of their guilt  The issue was  that the valet  having received his wages  was kicked out of doors  and the lady ordered to decamp  without being even permitted to take any more clothes than what were barely sufficient for her present use   The reader is to be informed  and I hope he will excuse the omission  as proceeding more from inadvertency than any other cause  that when Miss ELLIOT quitted the English stage  she found herself involved in a variety of debts  which she was unable to discharge  notwithstanding her income was greater than ever she could have reasonably expected  and therefore  in order to avoid the insolent importunities of her creditors  she judged it adviseable to make a trip to Dublin  having previously obtained a settlement from the managers of the theatre there     81She did not however remain long there  and on her return to England  finding it impossible to wrest the capital parts from those actresses who had long enjoyed them by theatrical prescription  she listened to the addresses of the honourable Mr  H—y  who engaged  by his connexions and interest  to carry every point she proposed  In this however she found herself mistaken  for though this gentleman exerted all his influence in her favour  the managers were not convinced that she had talents for those superior parts  or that she was so improved  as to entitle her to preclude the performers who then filled them to the general satisfaction of the town  Disgusted with their behaviour  he obliged her to quit the stage  and trust for her support to his fortune and affection  which last soon began to waver  when he found himself obliged to maintain a woman  who considered her abandoning the stage as a great sacrifice  and expected in return many concessions and indulgencies  Mutual coolness succeeded  and jealousy  confirmed afterwards by the strongest conviction of her guilt  was the cause of their separation  and his mistress  and valet de chambre   82 were dismised together  as we have already seen   Notwithstanding this stroke of adverse fortune  she still rose higher from the rebound  She remained  however  for some time in an obscure state  and though she did not publicly walk the streets as before  yet she had a set of constant customers  who either visited her at her own lodgings  or else sent for her to some tavern or bagnio  This flow of business  though  if I may be allowed the expression  only in the retail way  enabled her to live comfortably  and by degrees encrease her little stock of clothes  without being forced to run in debt for them  In proportion  as her wardrobe became more valuable  her trade increased  and being at length able to appear with some degree of propriety in a side box  she did not fail of making many valuable conquests  adversity  the best mistress of frugality  having shewed the inconveniences resulting from extravagance  made her now regulate her expences within the bounds of moderation     83Being now able to assume the appearance of a woman of condition  she endeavoured to draw in some unexperienced youth in the way of marriage  or at least to procure an advantageous settlement from some rich cully  Pursuant to this plan  she frequented all public places  but to her great grief  she soon found that she was too well known to hope for success in the former way  and therefore wisely confined her desires to the latter  In this she succeeded  and was taken into keeping by a certain rich Jew   whose name  for particular reasons  we judge proper to conceal   to whom she had no objection  but his advanced age and peculiar religion  but his wealth over ballanced all these considerations   Notwithstanding the general obloquy and reproach under which this people lies  she found her keeper to be a very worthy man  and was greatly pleased with her situation  because he was so much engaged in business  that he had not an opportunity of taking notice of the frequent infidelities she was guilty of towards him     84While she was kept by the Jew  she had frequent interviews with some of her old friends  particularly Mr  M—y  who seemed to have the same warm passion he at first entertained for her  together with the same degree of affection  which she esteemed an evident proof of the goodness of his heart   Her keeper being obliged to go to Holland about his affairs  and having given her to understand that he did not expect to return in less than a month  she was overjoyed at the intelligence  but she was so much mistress of the art of dissembling  an art full as necessary in a kept mistress as a courtier  that she expressed the highest concern at parting  and went so far as to shed tears   Notwithstanding her concern at his departure
