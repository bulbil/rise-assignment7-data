you were seven years old  he is vastly better for his voyage  and the clear air of Canada  and looks ten years younger than before he set out       Adieu  I am going to ramble in the woods  and pick berries  with a little smiling civil captain  who is enamoured of me  a pretty rural amusement for lovers       Good morrow  my dear Emily   Yours   A  FERMOR     LETTER XVI   16    To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Silleri  Sept  18   YOUR brother  my dear  is gone to Montreal with Sir George Clayton  of whom I suppose you have heard  and who is going to marry a friend of mine  to pay a visit to Monsieur le General  who is arrived there  The men in Canada  the English I mean  are eternally changing place  even when they have not so pleasing a call  travelling is cheap and amusing  the prospects lovely  the weather inviting  and there are no very lively pleasures at present to attach them either to Quebec or Montreal  so that they divide themselves between both       This fancy of the men  which is extremely the mode  makes an agreable circulation of inamoratoes  which serves to vary the amusement of the ladies  so that upon the whole  tis a pretty fashion  and deserves encouragement       You expect too much of your brother  my dear  the summer is charming here  but with no such very striking difference from that of England  as to give room to say a vast deal on the subject  though I believe  if you will please to compare our letters  you will find  putting us together  we cut a pretty figure in the descriptive way  at least if your brother tells me truth       You may expect a very well painted frost piece from me in the winter  as to the present season  it is just like any fine autumn in England  I may add  that the beauty of the nights is much beyond my power of description  a constant Aurora borealis  without a cloud in the heavens  and a moon so resplendent that you may see to read the smallest print by its light  one has nothing to wish but that it was full moon every night  Our evening walks are delicious  especially at Silleri  where  tis the pleasantest thing in the world to listen to soft nonsense     Whilst the moon dances through the trembling leaves     A line I stole from Philander and Sylvia   But to return         The French ladies never walk but at night  which shews their good taste  and then only within the walls of Quebec  which does not  they saunter slowly  after supper  on a particular battery  which is a kind of little Mall  they have no idea of walking in the country  nor the least feeling of the lovely scene around them  there are many of them who never saw the falls of Montmorenci  though little more than an hour s drive from the town  They seem born without the smallest portion of curiosity  or any idea of the pleasures of the imagination  or indeed any pleasure but that of being admired  love  or rather coquetry  dress  and devotion  seem to share all their hours  yet  as they are lively  and in general handsome  the men are very ready to excuse their want of knowledge       There are two ladies in the province  I am told  who read  but both of them are above fifty  and they are regarded as prodigies of erudition   Eight in the evening       Absolutely  Lucy  I will marry a savage  and turn squaw  a pretty soft name for an Indian princess    never was any thing so delightful as their lives  they talk of French husbands  but commend me to an Indian one  who lets his wife ramble five hundred miles  without asking where she is going       I was sitting after dinner with a book  in a thicket of hawthorn near the beach  when a loud laugh called my attention to the river  where I saw a canoe of savages making to the shore  there were six women  and two or three children  without one man amongst them  they landed  tied the canoe to the root of a tree  and finding out the most agreable shady spot amongst the bushes with which the beach was covered  which happened to be very near me  made a fire  on which they laid some fish to broil  and  fetching water from the river  sat down on the grass to their frugal repast       I stole softly to the house  and  ordering a servant to bring some wine and cold provisions  returned to my squaws  I asked them in French if they were of Lorette  they shook their heads  I repeated the question in English  when the oldest of the women told me  they were not  that their country was on the borders of New England  that  their husbands being on a hunting party in the woods  curiosity
