from the class of WiUiam  it cannot be   expected but they must act from the same natural principle with   him      I see the depravity of human nature  when stripped of disguise   and ornament  affects your unexperienced heart too strongly  But   consider that we see things as they really are  and to represent them   otherwise to you would invert the design of my mission  and con    firm rather than remove the prejudices that lead astray the mind   of man          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 69     However  this consolation I can give you  that the vices I have   abeady drawn  and may hereafter draw  to your view  are not   particular to this age or country   they are the weeds which  in   every age and clime  have always  and always will overrun the   human heart      Nor is it just to call them vices  though  in compliance with the   language of men  I do call them so  which perhaps are but   neces    sary parts of this universal system   and though in a particular   instance  and viewed by themselves  they may appear deformed    yet when thrown into the general representation of things  they   may have their beauty and use  if only to diversify the scene     and  with respect to men in particular  bo as   advantageous to   the community as they are prejudicial to individuals      But to return to my master WiUiam  Besides the advantages   of education  he had such from nature  that he was not only the   most accomplished gentleman  but also the handsomest fellow of his   time   a happiness of which he availed himself so weU in the polite   world  that he was the favourite of all the compliant fair  who   shared with him the pleasures they only suffered from his superiors   for hire      Of this I saw sufficient proof that very evening  when he went   to an assignation with the most celebrated courtesan of the age    who  sacrificing avarice to pleasure  gave orders to be denied to   everybody  and shut herself up with him  to give a loose to joy   for the evening      This was a scene too sensual for a spirit to describe   I shall   therefore only say that their fatigue and waste of spirits were re    cruited with the highest delicacies and richest wines  and the pauses   of joy enlivened with the recital of the adventures of their pro    fessions  heightened with the most poignant ridicule of those whose   folly was their fortune      Before satiety could paU their pleasures  time summoned them   to business â€” the fair to prepare for the reception of her friend  and   my master to wait on his   when to conclude the evening with proper   gallantry  he presented me to the maid at the door      I was a good deal surprised at being received with less emotion   by the portress of Venus than I had ever found before  the sight   of me having always raised joy  But this was soon explained    when  on returning to her mistress  she threw me on the table    and received a shilling in exchange â€” an instance of that methodical   economy  which by many savings makes up for one large expense   and exacts profit even from pleasure      The joy of the mistress seemed to make amends to my vanity   for the indifference of her maid  and promised me the full possession   of her heart   but I soon found myself mistaken  and that her love   for me was only while I was the property of another   for no sooner   did I become her own  than she threw me carelessly into her purse    and turned her thoughts immediately to the acquisition of more        IFroiu hence it should seem  the hint of the late treatise on the   â  origin of evil was borrowed  or else dictated by the same spirit    Â« Fable of the bees          70 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     Bnt  though I lost the greatest part of my power over her  by   coming into her possession  I still found ample room in her heart   for my abode      The apartments were scarce got in order  and my mistress new   dressed  when her friend appeared  to whom she flew with all the   appearance of rapture  But  however he might be deceived  the   difference was plain to me  between the joyless caresses she sold   to him  and the ecstasy she shared with my late master  the glow
