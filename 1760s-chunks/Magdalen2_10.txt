immediately from London to the spot I have been speaking of  and there continued ever since  confining her visits within a very narrow circle  and dedicating her attention to the education of her daughter  Within a mile of her house my Louisa was at school when a child  and the intimacy between the little ones naturally creating an acquaintance between the parents  Mrs  Beauclerk and our family have been upon the most unreserved footing of friendship these   55 sixteen years  and  I dare say  shall continue in friendship till the end of our lives  as there is but one circumstance which can possibly disturb the harmony of our correspondence     As it would have been extremely rude in a stranger to ask what this circumstance was  I did not interrupt Mr  Mildmay  nevertheless I was lucky enough  in the naturally communicativeness of his temper  to have my curiosity gratified  his heart was now open  and he considered me as a good natured friendly man who might be trusted with a secret  drawing his chair therefore closer to mine  and lowering his voice  he proceeded to unbosom himself to the following purport     You must know  Mr  Melmoth  that  during the intimacy between Mrs  Beauclerk s family and mine  I have   56 discovered that my son entertains very favourable sentiments of her daughter  and between ourselves I can see plainly enough that her daughter is no way disinclined to my son  I have been a young fellow myself  Mr  Melmoth  and  in my time—you understand me—but that is nothing to the purpose—As I was saying  this mutual good opinion between Harry and Miss Beauclerk  is a thing which gives me no little uneasiness—the young lady to be sure possesses a very high place in my esteem  and I don t know a woman in the kingdom whom I should be better pleased to have for a daughter  but the misfortune is she does not carry sufficient weight of metal  and I have some family views in my head  which  though I am pretty well in the world  require a considerable addition of fortune  My house  Mr  Melmoth  is a very antient one    57 there have been more than two peerages in it  and I have myself some expectation of a title  Now  Sir  as the support of such a dignity cannot allow me to marry my son to a woman of little fortune  on this account I am greatly concerned that any secret correspondence should be carried on between him and Miss Beauclerk  I should be very sorry to oppose his inclinations  or to wound her sensibility  but you know the raising of one s family is a very essential point  and that  ridiculous as a coronet may appear to some people  it is nevertheless entitled to priviledges  which are far from being disagreeable—This is not all—a noble lord in the neighbourhood  who is able to give his daughter a prodigious sum of money  has lately intimated  a desire of uniting his family with mine  and I think so very well of the affair  that I   58 mentioned it yesterday to my son  when I found him launching out into some passionate encomiums on Miss Beauclerk   —Mr  Mildmay pausing in this place  I could not help observing  that  though the plan which was thus laid down for the aggrandization of his family  might in itself be extremely right  nevertheless  if his son entertained a cordial affection for the young lady  the possession of her hand might be more conducive to his happiness than the possession of a title  and that therefore it might be difficult to make him sacrifice the interest of his heart even to gratify the laudable ambition of his father—But the old gentleman stopped me short  by declaring  He believed the colonel would do any thing to oblige him   However   says he   if I should be unhappily disappointed of his obedience in the matter we have been talking of  I know how   59 to punish his obstinacy when I come to dispose of my fortune   Here our conversation ended  for the ladies coming in we were obliged to talk of something else  though I should have told you  that Mr  Mildmay more than once insinuated a fear  that his lady secretly approved of the passion subsisting between Miss Beauclerk and the colonel     I could moralize in this place  Sir Robert  on the preposterous behaviour of those fathers who are willing to give their children every thing but happiness  Reflections of this nature  however  are too common to be useful  and it would be just as new to tell you  that the parts of a day consist of twenty four hours  as to tell you that the very fondness of such fathers is the most insupportable of all tyrannies  Poor Miss Beauclerk—and is the tawdry gewgaw of a coronet to be put in competition   60 with the charms of exalted virtue  elevated sense  and sweetness ineffable  But love would be too exquisite an enjoyment  Harold  had not Providence wisely thrown these bars in our way  and tempered the inexpressible raptures which it bestows with some occasional mixtures of infelicity   Lady Haversham just now called me aside  and hinted that she had spoken to Mrs
