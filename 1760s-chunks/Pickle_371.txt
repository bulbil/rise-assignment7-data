despatches  transmitted an account of the affair to the duke of  Newcastle  among the other transactions of the fleet    In September or October  1741  Mr  A   arrived in London  and the first  person to whom he applied for advice and assistance was a man of the  law  nearly related to the families of A   and A    and well acquainted  with the particular affairs of each  who  far from treating him as a  bastard and impostor  received him with civility and seeming kindness   asked him to eat  presented him with a piece of money  and  excusing  himself from meddling in the affair  advised him to go to Ireland  as  the most proper place for commencing a suit for the recovery of his  right    Before the young gentleman had an opportunity  or indeed any  inclination  to comply with this advice  he was accidentally met in  the street by that same H    who  as I have mentioned  gave Mr  M   the  first insight into the affair  This man immediately knew the claimant   having been formerly an agent for his father  and afterwards a creature  of his uncle s  with whom he was  not without reason  suspected to be  concerned in kidnapping and transporting his nephew  Be that as it will   his connections with the usurper were now broken off by a quarrel  in  consequence of which he had thrown up his agency  and he invited the  hapless stranger to his house  with a view of making all possible  advantage of such a guest    There he had not long remained  when his treacherous landlord   tampering with his inexperience  effected a marriage between him and the  daughter of one of his own friends  who lodged in his house at the same  time  But afterwards  seeing no person of consequence willing to espouse  his cause  he looked upon him as an encumbrance  and wanted to rid  his hands of him accordingly  He remembered that Mr  M   had expressed  himself with all the humanity of apprehension in favour of the  unfortunate young nobleman  before his arrival in England  and  being  well acquainted with the generosity of his disposition  he no sooner  understood that he was returned from France  than he waited upon him  with an account of Mr  A   s being safely arrived  Mr  M   was sincerely  rejoiced to find  that a person who had been so cruelly injured  and  undergone so long and continued a scene of distress  was restored to  a country where he was sure of obtaining justice  and where every good  man  as he imagined  would make the cause his own  And being informed  that the youth was in want of necessaries  he gave twenty guineas to H    for his use  and promised to do him all the service in his power   but had no intention to take upon himself the whole weight of such an  important affair  or indeed to appear in the cause  until he should be  fully and thoroughly satisfied that the claimant s pretensions were well  founded     6 22 15  3 45 PM    In the meantime  H   insinuating that the young gentleman was not  safe in his present lodging from the machinations of his enemies  M    accommodated him with an apartment in his own house  where he was at  great pains to remedy the defect in his education  by rendering him fit  to appear as a gentleman in the world  Having received from him all the  intelligence he could give relating to his own affair  he laid the case  before counsel  and despatched a person to Ireland  to make further  inquiries upon the same subject  who  in his first arrival in that  kingdom  found the claimant s birth was as publicly known as any  circumstance of that kind could possibly be  at so great a distance of  time    The usurper and his friends gave all the interruption in their power to  any researches concerning that affair  and had recourse to every art  and expedient that could be invented  to prevent its being brought to  a legal discussion  Privilege  bills in chancery  orders of court  surreptitiously and illegally obtained  and every other invention was  made use of to bar and prevent a fair and honest trial by a jury  The  usurper himself  and his agents  at the same time that they formed  divers conspiracies against his life  in vain endeavoured to detach  Mr  M   from the orphan s cause  by innumerable artifices  insinuating   cajoling  and misrepresenting  with surprising dexterity and  perseverance    His protector  far from being satisfied with their reasons  was not  only deaf to their remonstrances  but  believing him in danger from  their repeated efforts  had him privately conveyed into the country   where an unhappy accident  which he hath ever since sincerely regretted   furnished his adversary with a
