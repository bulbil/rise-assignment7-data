do for her   I doubt  her man is a man of the town  added he    110 but he may have lived long enough to see his follies  She may be tired of the life she has led  I have made several efforts to do her service  but had no hope to reclaim her  I wish she may now be a wife in earnest  But this  I think  shall be my last effort—Write  my dear  but nothing of your intention  If she is not married  things must remain as they are   She hastened up stairs  and very soon returned  with the following lines   Madam   I Beseech you to believe  that I am not wanting in duty to my mother  You rejoice my heart  when you tell me  that you love me  My guardian was so good  before I could have time to ask him  as to bid me write to you  and to let you know  that he will himself present me to you  whenever you please to favour me with an opportunity to pay my duty to you  at his house in St  James s Square   Let me hope  my dear mamma  that you will not be so angry with your poor girl  as you was last time I saw you at Mrs  Lane s  and then I will see you with all the duty that a child owes to her mother  For I am  and will ever be   Your dutiful Daughter  EMILIA JERVOIS   Sir Charles generously scrupled the last paragraph  We will not  I think  Emily  said he  remind a mother  who has written such a Letter as that before us  of a behaviour that she should be glad to forget   Miss Grandison desired it might stand  Who knows  says she  but it may make her ashamed of her outrageous behaviour at that time   She deserves not generous usage  said Lady L   she cannot feel it   Perhaps not  replied Sir Charles  but we should do proper things  for our own sakes  whether the persons   111 are capable of feeling them as they ought  or not  What say you  Miss Byron  to this last paragraph   I was entirely in his way of thinking  and for the reason he gave  but the two Ladies having given their opinion in a pretty earnest manner  and my Lord saying he thought it might pass  I was afraid it would look like bespeaking his favour at their expence  if I adopted his sentiments  I therefore declined giving my opinion  But being willing to keep Emily in countenance  who sat suspended in her judgment  as one who feared she had done a wrong thing  I said  it was a very natural paragraph  I thought  from Miss Jervois s pen  as it was written  I dared to say  rather in apprehension of hard treatment  from what she remembered of the last  than in a spirit of recrimination or resentment   The good girl declared  it was  Both Ladies  and my Lord  said  I had distinguished well  But Sir Charles  tho  he said no more upon the subject  looked upon each sister with meaning  which I wondered they did not observe  Dr  Bartlett was withdrawn  or I believe he would have had the honesty to speak out  which I had not  But the point was a point of delicacy and generosity  and I thought I should not seem to imagine that I understood it better than they  Nor did I think that Sir Charles would have acquiesced with their opinion   Miss Jervois retired  to transcribe her letter  We all separated  to dress  and I  having soon made an alteration in mine  dropt in upon Dr  Bartlett in his closet   I am stealing from this good man a little improvement in my geography  I am delighted with my tutor  and he professes to be pleased with his scholar  but sometimes more interesting articles slide in  But now he had just began to talk of Miss Jervois  as if he would have led  I thought  to the proposal hinted at by Miss Grandison  from the letter she had so clandestinely   112 seen  of my taking her under my care  when Sir Charles entered the doctor s apartment  He would have withdrawn  when he saw me  but the doctor  rising from his chair  besought him to oblige us with his company   I was silly  I did not expect to be caught there  But why was I silly on being found with Dr  Bartlett—But let me tell you  that I thought Sir Charles himself  at first  addressing me  seemed a little unprepared  You invited me in  doctor  Here I am  But if you were upon a subject that you do not pursue  I shall look upon myself as an intruder  and will withdraw   We had just concluded one subject  and were beginning another—I had just mentioned Miss Jervois   Is not Emily a good child  Miss Byron  said Sir Charles   Indeed  Sir  she is   We then had some general talk
