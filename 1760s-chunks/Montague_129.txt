kind of bashful fear of objecting to such persons as their parents recommend as proper objects of their tenderness       I am prevented by company from saying all I intended       Adieu  Your faithful  ED  RIVERS     LETTER CCX   210   To Colonel RIVERS   Temple house  Nov  1   YOU wrong me excessively  my dear Rivers  in accusing me of a natural levity in love and friendship       As to the latter  my frequent changes  which I freely acknowledge  have not been owing to any inconstancy  but to precipitation and want of caution in contracting them       My general fault has been the folly of chusing my friends for some striking and agreable accomplishment  instead of giving to solid merit the preference which most certainly is its due       My inconstancy in love has been meerly from vanity       There is something so flattering in the general favor of women  that it requires great firmness of mind to resist that kind of gallantry which indulges it  though absolutely destructive to real happiness       I blush to say  that when I first married I have more than once been in danger  from the mere boyish desire of conquest  notwithstanding my adoration for your lovely sister  such is the force of habit  for I must have been infinitely a loser by changing       I am now perfectly safe  my vanity has taken another turn  I pique myself on keeping the heart of the loveliest woman that ever existed  as a nobler conquest than attracting the notice of a hundred coquets  who would be equally flattered by the attention of any other man  at least any other man who had the good fortune to be as fashionable       Every thing conspires to keep me in the road of domestic happiness  the manner of life I am engaged in  your friendship  your example  and society  and the very fear I am in of losing your esteem       That I have the seeds of constancy in my nature  I call on you and your lovely sister to witness  I have been your friend from almost infancy  and am every hour more her lover       She is my friend  my companion  as well as mistress  her wit  her sprightliness  her pleasing kind of knowledge  fill with delight those hours which are so tedious with a fool  however lovely       With my Lucy  possession can never cure the wounded heart       Her modesty  her angel purity of mind and person  render her literally     My ever new delight           She has convinced me  that if beauty is the mother  delicacy is the nurse of love       Venus has lent her her cestus  and shares with her the attendance of the Graces       My vagrant passions  like the rays of the sun collected in a burning glass  are now united in one point       Lucy is here  Adieu  I must not let her know her power       You spend to morrow with us  we have a little ball  and are to have a masquerade next week       Lucy wants to consult Emily on her dress  you and I are not to be in the secret  we have wrote to ask the Fitzgeralds to the masquerade  I will send Lucy s post coach for them the day before  or perhaps fetch them myself       Adieu   Your affectionate  J  TEMPLE     LETTER CCXI   211   To Captain FITZGERALD   Bellfield  Nov  1   I HAVE this moment a letter from Temple which has set my heart at rest  he writes like a lover  yet owns his past danger  with a frankness which speaks more strongly than any professions could do  the real present state of his heart       My anxiety for my sister has a little broke in on my own happiness  in England  where the married women are in general the most virtuous in the world  it is of infinite consequence they should love their husbands  and be beloved by them  in countries where gallantry is more permitted  it is less necessary       Temple will make her happy whilst she preserves his heart  but  if she loses it  every thing is to be feared from the vivacity of his nature  which can never support one moment a life of indifference       He has that warmth of temper which is the natural soil of the virtues  but which is unhappily  at the same time  most apt to produce indiscretions       Tame  cold  dispassionate minds resemble barren lands  warm  animated ones  rich ground  which  if properly cultivated  yields the noblest fruit  but  if neglected  from its luxuriance is most productive of weeds       His misfortune has been losing both his parents when almost an infant  and having been master of himself and a noble fortune  at an age when the passions hurry us beyond the bounds of reason       I am the only person on earth by whom he would ever bear to be controlled in any thing  happily for Lucy  I
