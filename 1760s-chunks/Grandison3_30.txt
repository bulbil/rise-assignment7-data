 I must not palliate in this case  and yet of hatred and animosity  with the person who is a partaker in that guilt   I am put upon a very unequal task  Sir  to talk with you on this subject  My Lord will not refuse to see me  I hope  I know what to say to him   He has requested me to talk with you  madam  As I told you  I am not fond of the task  We have all our faults  God knows what he will pardon  and   73 what he will punish  His pardon  however  in a great measure depends upon yourself  You have health and time  to all appearance  before you  Your future life may be a life of penitence  I am no divine  madam  I would not be thought to preach to you  But you have now a prospect opened of future happiness  thro  your mutual misunderstandings  that you never otherwise might have had  And let me make an observation to you  That where hate or dislike have once taken place of liking  the first separation  in such a case as this  is always the best  Affection or esteem between man and woman  once forfeited  hardly ever is recovered  Tell me truth—Don t you as heartily dislike my Lord  as he does you   I do  Sir—He is—  I will not hear what he is  from the mouth of declared prejudice  He has his faults  One great fault is  that which you have been joint partakers in—But if you might  would you choose to live together to be torments to each other   I can torment him more than he can me—  Diabolical temper —Woman   and I stood up  and looked sternly  Can you forget to whom you say this—and of whom —Is not Lord W  my uncle   This  as I intended it should  startled her ▪She asked my pardon   What a fine hand  proceeded I  has a Peer of the realm made of it  to have this said of him  and perhaps  had you been in his presence  to him  by a woman whose courage is founded in his weakness —Let me tell you  madam—  She held up her clasped hands—For God s sake  forgive me  Sir  and stand my friend   An hundred and fifty pounds a year  madam  is rich payment for any consideration that a woman could give  who has more spirit than virtue  Had you kept that  madam  you would  tho  the daughter of cottagers    74 have been superior to the greatestman on earth  who wanted to corrupt you —But thus far  and as a punishment to my Lord for his wilful weakness  I will be your friend—Retire from my Lord  You shall have 250l  a year  And as you were not brought up to the expectation of one half of the fortune  bestow the hundred a year  that was in debate  upon young creatures of your sex  as an encouragement to them to preserve that chastity  which you  with your eyes open  gave up  and  with the rest  live a life suitable to that disposition  and then  as my fellow creature  I will wish you happy   She begged leave to withdraw  She could not  she said  stand in my presence  I had  indeed  spoken with warmth  She withdrew  trembling  courtesying  mortified  and I returned to my Lord   He was very earnest to hear my report  I again put it to him  Whether he adhered to his resolution of parting with his woman  He declared in the affirmative  with greater earnestness than before  and begged to know  if I could manage it that she should go  and that without seeing him  I cannot bear to see her  said he   Bravoes of the Law  cowards and cullies to their paramours  are these keepers  generally  I have ever suspected the courage  to magnanimity they must be strangers  of men who can desy the laws of society  I pitied him  And believing that it would not be difficult to manage this heroine  who had made her weak Lord afraid of her  I said  Have you a mind  my Lord  that she shall quit the house this night  and before I leave it  If you have  I think I can undertake  that she shall   And can you do this for me  If you can  you shall be my great Apollo  That will  indeed  make me happy  For the moment you are gone  she will force herself into my presence  and will throw the gout  perhaps  into my stomach  She reproaches me  as if she   75 had been an innocent woman  and I the most ungrateful of men  For God s sake  nephew  release me from her  and I shall be happy  I would have left her behind me in the country  proceeded he  but she would come with me  She was afraid that I would appeal to you  She stands in awe of nobody else  You will be my guardian Angel
