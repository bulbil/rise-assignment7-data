security for the magician s fee  to be  paid from the profits of his first third night  had not Cadwallader s  curiosity prompted him to know the subject of this gentleman s inquiry   He therefore told him  that  in consideration of his genius  he would  for once satisfy him without a fee  and desired him to specify the  doubts in which he wished to be resolved   The son of Parnassus  glad of this condescension  for which he thanked  the necromancer  gave him to understand  that he had some time before  presented a play in manuscript to a certain great man  at the head of  taste  who had not only read and approved the performance  but also  undertaken to introduce and support it on the stage  that he  the  author  was assured by this patron  that the play was already  in  consequence of his recommendation  accepted by one of the managers  who  had faithfully promised to bring it to light  but that  when he waited  on this said manager  to know when he intended to put his production  in rehearsal  the man declared he had never seen or heard of the piece    Now  Mr  Conjurer   said he   I want to know whether or not my play has  been presented  and if I have any sort of chance of seeing it acted this  winter    Cadwallader  who had  in his younger days  sported among the theatrical  muses  began to lose his temper at this question  which recalled the  remembrance of his own disappointments  and despatched the author  with an abrupt answer  importing that the affairs of the stage were  altogether without the sphere of his divination  being entirely  regulated by the daemons of dissimulation  ignorance  and caprice     6 22 15  3 45 PM   It would be an endless task to recount every individual response  which our magician delivered in the course of his conjuration  He was  consulted in all cases of law  physic  and trade  over and above the  ordinary subjects of marriage and fornication  his advice and assistance  were solicited by sharpers  who desired to possess an infallible method  of cheating unperceived  by fortune hunters  who wanted to make prize of  widows and heiresses  by debauchees  who were disposed to be with other  men s wives  by coxcombs  who longed for the death of their fathers   by wenches with child  who wished themselves rid of their burdens  by  merchants  who had insured above value  and thirsted after the news of a  wreck  by underwriters  who prayed for the gift of prescience  that they  might venture money upon such ships only as should perform the voyage  in safety  by Jews  who wanted to foresee the fluctuations of stock  by  usurers  who advance money upon undecided causes  by clients  who  were dubious of the honesty of their counsel  In short  all matters  of uncertain issue were appealed to this tribunal  and  in point of  calculation  De Moivre was utterly neglected   CHAPTER LXXXIV   The Conjurer and his Associate execute a Plan of Vengeance against  certain Infidels who pretend to despise their Art  and Peregrine  achieves an Adventure with a young Nobleman   By these means  the whole variety of characters undisguised passed  as  it were  in review before the confederates  who  by divers ingenious  contrivances  punished the most flagrant offenders with as much severity  as the nature of their plan would allow  At length they projected a  scheme for chastising a number of their own acquaintance  who had all  along professed the utmost contempt for the talent of this conjurer   which they endeavoured to ridicule in all companies  where his  surprising art was the subject of discourse  not that they had sense  and discernment enough to perceive the absurdity of his pretensions   but affected a singularity of opinions  with a view of insulting the  inferior understandings of those who were deceived by such an idle  impostor   Peregrine  indeed  for obvious reasons  had always espoused their  judgment in this case  and joined them in reviling the public character  of his friend  But he knew how far the capacities of those virtuosi  extended  and had frequently caught them in the fact of recounting their  exploits against the conjurer  which were the productions of their own  invention only  On these considerations  his wrath was kindled against  them  and he accordingly concerted measures with his coadjutor  for  overwhelming them with confusion and dismay   In the first place  a report was spread by his emissaries  that the  magician had undertaken to entertain their view with the appearance of  any person whom his customers should desire to see  whether dead  or at  the distance of a thousand leagues  This extraordinary proposal chancing  to be the subject of conversation in a place where most of those    6 22 15  3 45 PM   infidels were assembled  they talked of it in the usual style  and some
