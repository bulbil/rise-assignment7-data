been impracticable for us to have walked one mile further —We therefore bargained with the driver  whose name was Joey  to give us a cast to the next stage for a shilling  at which place we would meet the master of the waggon  with whom we might agree for the rest of the journey     Accordingly the convenience stopt  and Joey having placed the ladder  Strap  being loaded with our baggage  mounted first  but just as he was getting in  a tremendous voice assailed his ears in these words     God s fury  there shall no passengers come here  —  The poor shaver was so disconcerted at this exclamation  which both he and I imagined proceeded from the mouth of a giant  that he descended with great velocity  and a countenance as white as paper —Joey perceiving our astonishment  called with an arch sneer    Waunds  captain  whay woan t yau sooffer the poor waggoneer to meake a penny —Coom  coom  young man  get oop  get oop —never moind the coptain —I se not   75 afear d of the coptain  —  This was not encouragement sufficient to Strap  who could not be prevailed upon to venture up again  upon which I attempted  though not without a quaking heart  when I heard the same voice muttering like distant thunder    By G—d I won t be used so  d—n—n seize me if I am  —  However I crept in  and by accident got an empty place in the straw  which I immediately took possession of  without being able to discern the faces of my fellow travellers in the dark  Strap following with the knapsack on his back  chanced to take the other side  and by a jolt of the carriage  pitched directly upon the stomach of the captain  who bellowed out in a most dreadful manner    Blood and thunder  where s my sword  —  At these words  my frighted comrade started up  and at one spring  bounced against me with such force  that I thought the supposed son of Anak intended to smother me —In the mean time a female voice cried out    Bless me  what is the matter  my dear     The matter  replied the captain  damn my blood  my guts are almost squeezed out by that Scotchman s hump    Strap trembling all the while at my back  asked him pardon  and laid the blame of what had happened upon the jolting of the waggon —The woman who spoke before  went on    Ay  ay  my dear  it is our own fault—we may thank ourselves for all the inconveniencies we meet with —I thank God  I never travelled so before —I m sure if my lady or Sir John was to know where we are  they would not sleep this night for vexation —I wish to God we had writ for the chariot —I know we shall never be forgiven     Come  come  my dear  replied the captain    76 it don t signify fretting now —we shall laugh it over as a frolick —I hope you will not suffer in your health —I shall make my lord very merry with our adventures in the Diligence  —  This discourse gave me such a high notion of the captain and his lady  that I durst not venture to join in the conversation  but immediately after  another female voice begins    Some people give themselves a great many needless airs—better folks than any here have travelled in waggons before now —Some of us have rode in coaches and chariots with three footmen behind them  without making so much fuss about it —What then  we are now all upon a footing  therefore let us be sociable and merry —What do you say  Isaac  Is n t this a good motion  you doting rogue —Speak  you old cent  per cent  fornicator —What desperate debt are you thinking of  What mortgage are you planning  Well  Isaac  positively you shall never gain my favour till you turn over a new leaf  grow honest  and live like a gentleman —In the mean time  give me a kiss  you old fumbler  —  These words  accompanied with a hearty smack  enlivened the person to whom they were addressed  to such a degree  that he cried in transport  tho  with a quavering voice    Ah  you wanton baggage—upon my credit  you are a waggish girl  he  he  he  —  This laugh introduced a fit of coughing  which almost suffocated the poor usurer  such  we afterwards found  was the profession of this our fellow traveller  —About this time  I fell asleep  and enjoyed a comfortable nap till such time as we arrived at the inn where we put up —Here  having got out of the waggon   77 first  I had an opportunity of viewing the passengers in order as they entered —The first who appeared was a brisk airy girl  about twenty years old  with a silver laced hat on her head  instead of a cap  a blue stuff riding suit trimmed with silver  very much tarnished  and a whip in her hand —After her  came limping  an old man
