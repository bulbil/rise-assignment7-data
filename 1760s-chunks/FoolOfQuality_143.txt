     By no means  madam  answered Mr  Fenton  For if such cha    racters are impressed by nature on a countenance  independent   of any such characters in the mind  this would first overthrow   the whole system of the physiognomists  who judged of the mind   by the countenance alone   and secondly  it would overthrow the   opinion of Socrates himself  who allowed that his countenance   had received such impressions from the natural bent and disposi    tion of his mind  But again  if the mind has really a power to   impress her own character or likeness on the countenance  what   should take away this power  why does not she retain it  Why   should not a total change of character in the soul  make some   suitable change of character in the aspect  It does  madam  it   does make a total change  And there are thousands of faces in   yonder sanctified city  that once expressed all the sweetness of   bashful modesty  and yet are now as much hardened and bronzed   over with impudence as the face of the statue at Charing cross      In the soft and pliable features of infancy and youth  the mind   can express itself with much more force and perspicuity  than in   the features of people more advanced in years  The nerves and   fibres  in our early age  are all open  active  and animated   they   reach to the outward surface of the skin   and the soul looks forth    and is seen through them  as a Spanish beauty is seen through a   veil of gauze  But time destroys many of these intelligible fibres     it also obstructs others  and it renders the remainder less sus    ceptible of those offices and mental impressions for which they   were ordained  till the surface of the countenance grows so callous   and rigid  that the beauties of the soul can no more be discovered   through it  than the luminaries of heaven through an atmosphere   of clouds  Scarce any thing  save sudden passion  can then be   discernible  like the flashes of lightning that break through the   gloom      For this very reason  my dear Mrs  Clement  were it possible   for you to advance in virtues as you advance in years  you will   however grow less amiable in the eyes of mortals  as your beauties   will be more and more shut in from their observation      This brings me to my last and most important remark on the   nature and power of beauty itself  And here we must note    that  though nothing can be afiectingly lovely and detestable that   does not arise from some sentiment of the soul  there is yet  in   many faces  such a natural symmetry or disproportion as is   generally called by the name of beauty and ugliness  Thus  in   some countenances  you perceive a due relation and agreement         134 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      between the parts   while in others the forehead may overwhelm   the nether face   or the mouth threaten to devour the other   features  or the nose may appear as a huge steeple that hides   a small church   or as a mountain that is the whole of a man s   estate   insomuch that as some may be said to want a nose to   their face  in the present case they may be said to want a face   to their nose  But this species of beauty and ugliness excites no   other kind of pleasure or disgust  save such as we receive from   two pieces of architecture  where one is executed with propriety    and the other is obviously out of all rule  And  to continue the   simile  if people should be seen looking out of the windows of   those two buildings  we may come to detest and avoid the first    and to love and frequent the latter  for the sake of those who   live therein  And just so it is with regular faces that express   a deformity of soul  and with disproportioned features that may   however be pregnant with the beauty of sentiment      By beauty  therefore  I do not mean the beauty of lines or   angles  of motion or music  of form or colour  of numerical   agreements or geometrical proportions   nor that which excites   the passion of some pragmatical inamoratos for a shell  a tulip    or a butterfly  All these have  undoubtedly  their peculiar beauty    but then that beauty has no relation to the power or perception of   that which contains it   it is derived from something that is alto    gether foreign  and owes the whole of its merit to the
