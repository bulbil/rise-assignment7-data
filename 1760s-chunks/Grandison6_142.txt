Greville  Guard  my dear Ladies  against these imbecillities of tender minds  In these instances  if in no other  will you give a superiority to our Sex  which  in the debate of this morning  my Charlotte would not allow of   I will begin my next Letter with an account of this debate  and if I cannot comprise it in the compass I intend to bring it into  my one more Letter may perhaps stretch into two   LETTER LV  Lady G  In Continuation   THE debate I mentioned  began on Friday morning at breakfast time  brought on by some of uncle Selby s good natured particularities  for he will always have something to say against women  I bespoke my brother s neutrality  and declared I would enter the lists with Mr  Selby  and allow all the other men present to be of his side  I had a flow of spirits  Man s usurpation  and woman s natural independency  was the topic  I carried on my argument very triumphantly  Now and then a sly hint  popt out by my brother  half disconcerted me  but I called him to order  and he was silent  Yet once he had like to have put me out—Wrapping his arms about himself  with inimitable humour—O my Charlotte  said he  how I love my country  ENGLAND is the only spot in the world  in which this argument can be properly debated —Very sly—Was it not   I made nothing of Mr  Selby  I called him the tyrant of the family  And as little of Mr  Deane    354 Lord L  and still less of my own Lord  who was as eager in the debate as if it concerned him more than any body to resist me  and this before my brother  who by his eyes  more than once  seemed to challenge me  because of the sorry creature s earnestness  All those  however  were men of straw with me  and I thought myself very near making Mr  Selby ask pardon of his Dame for his thirty years usurpation  In short  I had half established our Sex s superiority on the ruin of that of the sorry fellows  when the debate was closed  and referred to Mrs  Shirley  as moderatrix  my brother still excluded any share in it —She indeed obliged me to lower my topsails a little      I think  said the venerable Lady  women are generally too much considered as a species apart  To be sure  in the duties and affairs of life  where they have different or opposite shares allotted them by Providence  they ought not to go out of their own sphere  or invade the mens province  any more than the men theirs  Nay  I am so much of this opinion  that tho  I think the confidence which some men place in their wives  in committing all their affairs to their care  very flattering to the opinion both of their integrity and capacity  yet I should not choose  and that not out of laziness to avoid the trouble  to interfere with the management without doors  which I think more properly the man s province  unless in some particular cases        But in common intercourse and conversation  why are we to be perpetually considering the Sex of the person we are talking to  Why must women always be addressed in an appropriated language  and not treated on the common footing of reasonable creatures  And why must they  from a false notion of modesty  be afraid of shewing themselves to be such and affect a childish ignorance        I do not mean  that I would have women enter into learned disputes  for which they are rarely qualified    355 But I think there is a degree of knowlege very compatible with their duties  therefore not unbecoming them  and necessary to make them fit companions for men of sense  A character in which they will always be found more useful than that of a plaything  the amusement of an idle hour        No person of sense  man or woman  will venture to launch out on a subject with which they are not well acquainted  The lesser degree of knowlege will give place to the greater  This will secure subordination enough  For the advantages of education which men must necessarily have over women  if they have made the proper use of them  will have set them so forward on the race  that we can never overtake them  But then don t let them despise us for this  as if their superiority were entirely founded on a natural difference of capacity  Despise us as women  and value themselves merely as men  For it is not the hat or cap which covers the head  that decides of the merit of it        In the general course of the things of this world  women have not opportunities of sounding the depths of science  or of acquainting themselves perfectly with polite literature  But this want of opportunity is not entirely confined to them  There are professions among the men no more favourable to these studies  than the common avocations of women  For example  merchants  whose attention is
