says she is not able to come down for her  as her health is but bad  and my lady V—— has been so good as to send down her own coach to carry the little family to town   My brother has taken the care of my master’s funeral upon himself  He is to be carried to the family burying place at Arnold Abbey  As soon as that is over  we must try to get my lady to town  she has no business to go into her own lonely house again  it would be enough to kill her   May 30  Thank God we have got back safe to London  My lady keeps up wonderfully  under the load of grief that she has at her heart  She does not complain nor lament herself  as I have seen some do  who have not been in half her trouble  She hardly spoke a word during her whole journey  and strove as much as possible not to cry  but I could observe that she never turned her eyes on the two little babes  one of whom sat on my lap  and the other beside me  but the tears ran down her cheeks   It was a doleful sight  the meeting between her and my lady Bidulph  The poor old lady grieves sadly  and looks mighty ill  I am afraid she will not hold out long  she has had great trials  for a lady so    far in years  Sir George came to see my lady  he looked troubled  I hope he will be good to her   June 1  My lady asked me this morning if I had thought of keeping any journal for this fortnight past  I told her I had  and she desired to see it  She shed so many tears while she read it  that the paper was quite wet when she gave it to me again  She ordered me to make up the packet  and send it off  as she was not in a condition to add any thing to it herself   Mrs Arnold in continuation    June 20  Yes  my dear Cecilia  I have need of the tender condolements  with which your last packet was filled  Well may you call me a child of affliction  I am now so exercised in sorrows  that I look forward to nothing else   Patty  I find  has been a faithful journalist  and has carried down her melancholy narrative to this day  this day  on which  for the first time  I have taken a pen in my hand for more than two months  but my eyes are much better  and I hope I shall not have occasion for the assistance of her pen  unless some new calamity should again disqualify me from using my own   Yet in the midst of my griefs  ought I not to return thanks to heaven  that I have such an asylum to fly to  as the arms of one of the best of mothers  Oh  my dear  while I have her  I ought not to say  that I have lost every thing  Sir George has been more obliging since my fatal loss than he was before  but still there wants that cordial heart which he formerly had  As for his lady  I know very little of her  She came to see me twice since my arrival in town  in all the formal parade of a state visit  How ill does the vanity of pomp suit with a house of mourning  Her visits were short  formal  and cold  She seems to be intolerably proud  and I thought looked as if she was disgusted at visiting people in lodgings  who were so nearly related to her  My brother and she are to go down this summer into Scotland  to see a nobleman who is her uncle by her mother’s side  She is ridiculously vain of her family  and has taught Sir George to be so too  so that now he hardly vouchsafes to own a relation that is untitled     June 21  Lady V——  whose friendship has been one of the chief resources of comfort to me  went out of town this morning  She is retired  for life I fear  to a distant part of Lancashire  in order to spend the rest of her days with her eldest sister  a widow lady  of whom she is very fond  Her son’s ill behaviour has disgusted her so  she has broke with him intirely  Her younger son is gone into the army  not  I find  with her approbation  and she told me  she has nothing now worth living for  at least nothing for which she should subject herself to the cares of life  She insisted on my corresponding with her  and renewed her assurances of that kind attachment  which I have already so strongly experienced   At another time the loss of this dear woman’s society would have affected me more sensibly  but I am so inured to disappointment and grief  that I am almost become a stoic   Patty has already informed you  that Miss Burchell is often with us  she is more sollicitous  more assiduous than ever in her attendance on my mother  I find she even sat up with her two nights  on
