old dame had been dumb  Now shall I go through another fiery tryal  Heaven help me  if lady Grimston were to be my judge  But my mother is all goodness   Well  but you want a description of this man  I will give it to you  though I have scarce patience to write about him  Indeed  Cecilia  I am vexed  I foresee a great deal of trouble from that quarter —But come  I will try what I can say   The man is about thirty  genteel  and handsome enough  at least he is reckoned so  and I believe I should think him so  if I were not angry with him  He is very like your brother Henry  and you know he is an allowed handsome man  He seems to have plain good sense  and is good humoured I believe  I do not know of what colour his eyes are  for I never looked much at him  Lady Grimston says he is a scholar  a thing she pretends to value highly   and a mighty sober  pious  worthy gentleman  He is of a very good family  and has an estate of about fifteen hundred pounds a year  upon which there is a jointure of three hundred pounds a year  paid to his brother’s widow  Part of the estate is in Kent  and part in this county of Essex  where he has a mansion house  a well enough looking old fashioned place  something in the Grimston hall stile  at about a mile distance from this  where he passes most of his time   I have told you already  he plays divinely on several instruments  this is the only circumstance about him that pleases me   He has not yet made his addresses to me in form  yet we all know that he intends it  from his uncommon assiduity towards me  but he has a sort of reserve about him  and loves to do every thing in his own way   Bless me —here he is—his chariot has just driven into the court  and Mrs Vere peeps in upon me  and with a most vexatious archness  bids me come down to the parlour  but I will not  unless my mother desires me  I will go into the garden  to be for a while out of the way   September 11  Yesterday evening was productive of nothing but looks and compliments  and bows  and so forth  except two or three delightful pieces of musick  which he executed incomparably  But  this morning  my Cecilia  Oh  this morning  the man spoke out  told me in down right plain English  that he loved me  How insipid is such a    declaration  when it comes from one  who is indifferent to us  I do not know how it was  but instead of being abashed  I could have smiled in his face when he declared himself  but you may be sure I did not  that would not have been pretty   I was sitting in the little drawing room  reading  when he came in  To be sure he was sent to me by the ancient ladies  otherwise he would not have intruded  for the man is not ill bred  The book happened to be Horace  upon his entering the room  I laid it by  he asked me politely enough  what were my studies  When I named the author  he took the book up  and opening the leaves  started  and looked me full in the face  I coloured  My charming Miss Bidulph  said he  do you prefer this to the agreeable entertainment of finishing this beautiful rose here  that seems to blush at your neglect of it  He spoke this  pointing to a little piece of embroidery that lay in a frame before me  I was nettled at the question  it was too assuming  Sir  I hope I was as innocently  and as usefully employed  and I assure you I give a greater portion of my time to my needle  than to my book   You are so lovely  madam  that nothing you can do needs an apology  An apology  I’ll assure you  did not this look  my dear  as if the man thought I ought to beg his pardon for understanding Latin  For this accidental  and I think  to a woman  trivial accomplishment  I am indebted  you know  to Sir George  who took so much pains with me  the two or three summers he was indisposed at Sidney Castle   He then proceeded to tell me how much he admired  how much he loved me  and that having been encouraged by lady Grimston’s assuring him that I was disengaged  observe that   he presumed to tell me so  Oh  thought I  perhaps thou are thyself a Grimstonian  and do not think it necessary that the heart should be consulted  I answered him mighty civilly  and mighty little to the purpose  Sir  I thank you for your favourable sentiments—Lady Grimston does me a great deal of honour—I think myself happy in her good opinion—But he was not to be so put off  he pressed me to give him hopes  as he called it  Alas  I
