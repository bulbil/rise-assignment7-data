Lord Stanley  who had been lately created Earl of Derby  was among the number of those who now had conspired against him  Though this nobleman had been loaded with favours  and was even then possessed of an immense fortune  yet  still dissatisfied  he sought for more  from his country s calamities  He was therefore arrested by the King s order  and  confessing his crime  was sentenced to suffer that death he so justly merited  You have hitherto observed how difficult it was to rule the English at this time  each province seemed desirous of placing some particular family upon the throne  and more eagerly took up arms  than willingly disposed themselves to legal subordination  To mix lenity with justice  upon proper occasions  required a very nice discernment  Henry shewed his judgment in this particular  whenever a conspirator took up arms against him  from a conscientious adherence to principle  and from a love of the house of York  he generally found pardon  but  if the only motive of his conspiring was a love of change  or an illicit desire to subvert those laws by which he was governed  he was then treated with more severity   While Warbeck s adherents were thus disappointed in England  he himself attempted landing   217 in Kent  but  being beat off from that coast by the inhabitants  he went from thence to Ireland  finding his hopes frustrated there also  he went next to try his success in Scotland  Here his fortune began to mend  James III  who was then King of that country  received him very favourably  acknowledged 〈◊〉 pretensions to be just  and soon after gave him  in marriage  a daughter of the Earl of Huntley  one of the most beautiful and accomplished ladies of her time  But  not content with these instances of favour  he was resolved to attempt setting him upon the throne of England  it was expected  that  upon Perkin s first appearance in that kingdom  all the friends of the house of York would rise in his favour  upon this ground  therefore  the King of Scotland entered the country with a strong army  and proclaimed the young adventurer wherever he went  but  contrary to expectation  he found none to second his claims  and  thus disappointed  he again retreated back to Edinburgh  where he continued to reside  till  upon the conclusion of a treaty of peace between the two kingdoms  he was once more obliged to leave Scotland  and to seek for a new protector   Perkin had now  for the space of five years  continued to alarm the King  he had been acknowledged in France  Flanders  Ireland  and Scotland  as lawful heir to the British crown  and had made some bold attempts to second his pretensions  The time  at length  came  that he was to act the same character in England which he had performed elsewhere with so much success  Some months before this there had been an insurrection in Cornwall  the inhabitants of that distant county  upon levying the taxes granted by parliament    218 resused to contribute to expences which were destined for the defence of an opposite part of the kingdom  Every insurrection now was followed with a project of dethroning the King  they therefore marched  with one Flammock  a lawyer  Bodiley  a carrier  and Lord Audley  at their head  directly to London  and incamped upon Black Heath  The King s forces there surrounded and attacked them  the battle was bloody  two thousand of these poor deluded wretches were killed upon the spot  and the rest forced to surrender at discretion  Lord Audley  and one or two of their ring leaders  were executed  but the rest  to the number of four thousand  dismissed home again in safety  But this moderation had not the proper effect upon minds too ignorant for gratitude  they attributed the King s clemency to fear  and  upon returning home  induced their friends to believe  that the whole kingdom was ready to rise to vindicate their quarrel  It was now  therefore  determined to send for Perkin Warbeck  who was then in Ireland  to put himself at their head  Perkin did not hesitate to accept their invitation  and  taking upon him the command  chose for his privy council one Hern  a broken mercer  Skelton  a taylor  and Astley  a scrivener  He published a proclamation also against Henry  in which he took the title of Richard IV  and  having drawn together a body of three thousand men  attempted to storm the city of Exeter  but without success   Henry  having received advice of his proceedings  said merrily  that he should now have the pleasure of visiting a person whom he had long wished to see  and then took the necessary measures to oppose him  Perkin  on the other hand   219 seeing that the King was marching to attack him  lost all courage  and  in the night  took sanctuary in the monastery of Bewley  Soon after  upon promise of a pardon  he surrendered himself to the King  and was confined in the Tower  but  escaping from thence  and finding it impracticable to get out of the kingdom  he
