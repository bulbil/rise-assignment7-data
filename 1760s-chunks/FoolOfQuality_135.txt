incidents of your life have been very   extraordinary  and have been evidently accompanied by the atten    tion and control of a peculiar providence  The same providence is   undoubtedly with  and over all  his works   though we are not   willing to admit him in what we call common occurrences  and   which  we think  we can account for without his interposition  But   in the passages of your story we see Omnipotence walking along   with you  step for step  by sudden successes  by calamities as   sudden  compelling you to attend to him  wrenching every other   prop and support from your dependence  shutting every other   prospect and resource from your sight  and never forsaking you    in weal or in woe  till he had fully convinced you of his fellowship   and regard  and had reconciled you to the bitterest of the dispensa    tions of your Creator      Your story  my dear friend  has been generally conversant in   middle or low life   and I observed that there is scarce a circum    stance in it which might not have happened to any body on any day   of the year  And yet  on the whole  I find a chain of more sur    prising and affecting events than I ever met with in history  or   even romance      God  I see  has made use of very severe methods to call you  and    as I may say  to compel you to come in  But do you think  Mr    Clement  that any methods less severe would have been equally   effectual   You must admit they would not  And this demonstrates   to me the difficulty  and almost the impossibility  of diverting any   man from that habit of thinking and acting which he contracts from   the people with whom he is daily conversant  In a world of saints    a sinner must be a devil   but in a world of sinners  the man who   has grace to deviate must be a saint indeed      Had I been in your situation on the day in which you say my   charity relieved you  I should have thought myself very little be    holden to that person who would have plucked me back from my   opening paradise  into a world of whose woes I had been so justly   weary  No  no  my friend   I did you and your Arabella the worst   office  as I think  that ye will ever receive  It was not to you that   God intended any benefit by restoring you to life   it was to those    and I hope they are many in number  who are to have the advantage   of your example and instructions  It is an advantage of which I   also propose to avail myself  and I request you  in behalf of my   little Harry hi particular  to accept your first retainer from our   hands          124 TEE FOOL OF QUALITY      So saying  Mr  Fenton carelessly slid a purse of a hundred   guineas into Clement s coat pocket  and  hastily calling to know if   supper was ready  left the room without ceremony      In about an hour the cloth was laid  and Mr  Fenton ordered   his family to be called together  He had seldom seen Arabella    and never had noticed her  for fear of adding to that confusion with   which he saw her oppressed at their first meeting  But now his   senses were all open and alive for observation   and  on her entrance    he saluted her as he would have received and saluted a descending   seraph      She had not yet recovered her flesh or her complexion   and Mr    Fenton for some time looked at her in vain  to discover those   striking and irresistible beauties to which a whole people had borne   joint testimony  by a voucher of public prostration and applause    But of all that Mr  Fenton had previously thought necessary for   producing such extraordinary and astonishing effects  he saw nothing   but a sentiment of lowliness throughout   a something in face  in   voice  and in motion  that was lovely  for no other reason that he   could find but for its being quite impossible that it should not be   beloved      Awe  gratitude  veneration  and a depth of self debasement    united to oppress the heart and spirits of Arabella   and in the course   of conversation she frequently hesitated and blushed exceedingly      Mr  Fenton  with his wonted delicacy  made haste to divest her   of the weight under which she apparently laboured  Madam  said   he  with a
