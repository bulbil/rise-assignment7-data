down clean for every hundredth traveller  and served the other ninety nine  one after another  without washing  Nevertheless  in such a bed  with a stomach distended to a surfeit by fricasseed cat  and then raked by sour wine  thanks to youth and a good constitution  I slept soundly  and passed the night without being disturbed   On the following day when I had breakfasted  and paid the reckoning as I had been treated  like a lord  I made but one stage to Segovia  On my arrival  I had the good fortune to find a shop  where they took me in for my board and lodging  but I staid there only six months  a journeyman barber  with whom I got acquainted  was going to Madrid  and drew me in to set off with him  I had no difficulty in procuring a situation on the same footing as at Segovia  I got into a shop of the very best custom  It is true  it was near the church of the Holy Cross  and that the neighbourhood of the Prince s Theatre brought a great deal of business  My master  two stirring fellows  and myself  could scarcely lather the chins of the people who came to be shaved  They were of all trades and conditions  among the rest  players and authors  One day  two persons of the last description happened to meet  They began conversing about the poets and pieces in vogue  when one of them mentioned my uncle s name  a circumstance which drew my attention more particularly to their discourse  Don Juan de Zavaleta  said one  will never do any good as an author  A man of a cold genius  without a spark of fancy  he has written himself down at a terrible rate by his last publication  And Louis Velez de Guevara  said the other  what has he done  A fine work to bring before the public  Was there ever anything so wretched  They mentioned I know not how many poets besides  whose names I have forgotten  I only recollect that they said no good of them  As for my uncle  they made a more honourable mention of him  agreeing that he was a personage of merit  Yes  said one  Don Pedro de la Fuenta is an excellent author  there is a sly humour in his compositions  blended with solid sense  which communicates an attic poignancy to their general effect  I am not surprised at his popularity both in court and city  nor at the pensions settled on him by the great  For many years past  said the other  he has enjoyed a very large income  He lives at the Duke de Medina Coeli s table  and has an apartment in his house  so that he is at no expense  he must be very well in the world   I lost not a syllable of what these poets were saying about my uncle  We had learnt in the family  that he made a noise in Madrid by his works  some travellers  passing through Olm√©do  had told us so  but as he took no notice of us  and seemed to have weaned himself from all natural ties  we on our side lived in a state of perfect indifference about him  Yet nature will prevail  as soon as I had heard that he was in a fair way  and had learned where he lived  I was tempted to go and call upon him  One thing staggered me a little  the literati had styled him Don Pedro  This don was an awkward circumstance  I had my doubts whether he might not be some other poet of the name  and not my uncle  Yet that apprehension did not damp my ardour  I thought he might have been ennobled for his wit  and determined to pay him a visit  For this purpose  with my master s leave  I tricked myself out one morning as well as I could  and sallied from our shop  a little proud of being nephew to a man who had gained so high a character by his genius  Barbers are not the most diffident people in the world  I began to conceive no mean opinion of myself  and riding the high horse with all the arrogance of greatness  inquired my way to the Duke de Medina Coeli s palace  I rang at the gate  and said  I wanted to speak with Signor Don Pedro de la Fuenta  The porter pointed with his finger to a narrow staircase at the fag end of the court  and answered    Go up there  then knock at the first door on your right  I did as he directed me  and knocked at a door  It was opened by a young man  whom I asked if those were the apartments of Signor Don Pedro de la Fuenta  Yes  answered he  but you cannot speak to him at present  I should be very glad  said I  just to say  How are you  I bring him news of his family  An you brought him news of the pope  replied he  I could not introduce you just now  He is writing  and while his wits are at work  he must not be disturbed  He will not be able to receive company
