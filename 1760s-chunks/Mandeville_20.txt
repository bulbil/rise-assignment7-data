give even these general hints  far be it form me to attempt to influence your judgment  let your opinion be ever free and your own  or  where your inexperience may want information  seek it from the best  and most enlightened of mankind  your excellent father  who has long sat with honor in the same house        Let me now  my amiable friend  thank you for your obliging attention  not only          1 101       to the ladies  of whom I could not doubt your care  but of my tenants  one of whom writes me word  that  coming to enquire when I should return  with a look of anxiety which shew d my return was of consequence to him  you took his aside  and  enquiring his business  found he wanted  from an accident which had involved him in a temporary distress  to borrow 100 L   for which you gave him a draught on your banker  with a goodness and sweetness of manner  which doubled the obligation  making only one condition  which the overflowing of his gratitude has made him unable to keep  that it should be a secret to all the world      Can Lady Mary do too much for a man who thus shews himself worthy the name of Mandeville  the characteristic of which has ever been the warmest benevolence            1 102          Another would  perhaps  insist on returning the money to you  but I will not rob you of the pleasure of making an honest man happy  you will however observe  that it is this once only I indulge you  and that you are the only person from whom I have ever suffered my family  for such I esteem all placed by Providence under my protection  to receive an obligation   tis a favour I have refused even to your father        Do not answer this  I shall possibly be with you before a letter could reach me     Adieu  Your affectionate Belmont      Can I  after this letter  my dear Mordaunt  entertain a wish for Lady Julia  without the blackest ingratitude  no  tho  I will not accept his generous offer  I can never forget he has made it  I will leave Belmont    I will forget her    What have I said  forget her  I must first lose all sense of my own being            1 103          Am I born to know every species of misery  I have this moment received a second letter from the Lady I once mentioned to you  filled with the softest and most affecting expressions of disinterested tenderness  indiscreet from excess of affection  she adjures me to meet her one moment in the rustic temple  where she is waiting for me  her messenger is gone  and  as I will not hazard exposing her by sending my servant  I have no choice left but to go  Heaven knows how unwillingly  Should we be seen  what an appearance would such a meeting have  I left Lady Julia to write letters  and on that account excused myself from attending her  yet can I leave her  whom love alone has made imprudent  to the consequence of her indiscretion  and the wild sallies of a mind torn by disappointment and despair  I will go  but how shall I behold her  how tell her pity is all I can return to so generous a passion  These trials are too great for a heart like mine  tender  sympathetic           1 104       compassionate  and softened by the sense of it s own sufferings  I shall expire with regret and confusion at her sight  Farewell   H  Mandeville      To Colonel Bellville      OUR party last night did not turn out so much in the still life way as I expected    unfortunate as I am    two rivals at once    la bellissima Julia has most certainly a penchant for Harry     tis absurd  for the thing is impossible  In the first place  I am rather afraid he has a kind of attachment to this creature  and in the second  I know Lord Belmont s sentiments on this head  and that  with all his generosity  no man breathing has a greater aversion to unequal marriages  the difference is so immense in every thing but birth and merit  that there remains not a shadow of hope for her  But these people of high          1 105       heroics are above attending to such trifling things as possibilities    I hope I am mistaken  but the symptoms are strong upon her  as you shall judge      I left you last night  to accompany Lady Julia to the wood we are both so fond of  the evening was
