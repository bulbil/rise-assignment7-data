that Shakespeare  who lived before the great Milton  has an easier  pleasanter  and more intelligible manner of writing  than Milton  If so  may it not be owing to Milton s greater learning  that Shakespeare has the advantage of that immortal poet in perspicuity   Is the fact certain  my dear Mr  Deane  that Milton wants perspicuity  I have been bold enough sometimes to think  that he makes a greater display of his reading  than was quite necessary to his unbounded subject  But the age in which Shakespeare flourished  might be called  The age of English Learning  as well as of English Bravery  The Queen and her court  the very Ladies of it  were more learned than any court of our English Sovereigns was before  or hath been since  What a prodigy of learning  in the short reign of Edward the VIth  was the Lady Jane Grey —Greek  as well as Latin  was familiar to her  So it was to Queen Elizabeth  And can it be supposed  that the natural genius s of those Ladies were more confined  or limited  for their knowlege of Latin and Greek  Milton  tho  a little nearer us  lived in harsher and more tumultuous times   O  Sir  said Harriet  then I find I was a very impertinent creature in the conversation to which you refer     359 Not so  my dearest Love —Mr  Walden  I remember  says  that learning in that assembly was not brought before a fair tribunal  He should have known  that it had not a competent advocate in him   But  Sir Charles  said Mr  Beachamp  I cannot but observe  that too much stress is laid upon Learning  as it is called  by those who have pretensions to it  You will not always find  that a scholar is a more happy man than an unlearned one  He has not generally more prudence  more wisdom  in the management of his affairs   What  my dear Beauchamp  is this saying  but that there is great difference between theory and practice  This observation comes very generously  and  with regard to the Ladies  very gallantly  from you  who are a learned man  But as you are also a very prudent man  let me ask you  Do you think you have the less prudence for your learning  If not  Is not learning a valuable addition   But pray  Sir Charles  said Mrs  Selby  let me ask your opinion  Do you think  that if women had the same opportunities  the same education  as men  they would not equal them  in their attainments   Women  my dear Mrs  Selby  are women sooner than men are men  They have not  therefore  generally  the learning time that men have  if they had equal genius s    If they had equal genius s   brother  Very well  My dear Sister Harriet  you see you have given your hand to one of the Lords of the creation —Vassal  bow to your Sovereign   Sir Ch  My dearest Love  take not the advice without the example   Lady G  Your servant  Sir  Well  but let me ask you  Do you think that there is a natural inferiority in the faculties of the one Sex  A natural superiority in those of the other     360Sir Ch  Who will answer this question for me   Not I  said Lord L  Not I  said Mr  Deane  Not I  said Mr  Beauchamp   Then I have fairly taken you in—You would  if you could  answer it in the Ladies favour  This is the same as a confession  I may therefore the more boldly pronounce  that  generally speaking  I have no doubt but there is   Help me  dear Ladies  said I  to fight this battle out  You say  Sr  you have no doubt that there is a natural inferiority in the faculties of us  poor women  a natural superiority in you  imperial men   Generally speaking  Charlotte  Not individually you Ladies  and us men  I believe all we who are present  shall be ready to subscribe to your superiority  Ladies   I believe  brother  you fib  But let that pass   Thank you  madam  It is for my advantage that it should  and perhaps for yours  smiling—There is a difference  pardon me  Ladies  we are speaking generally  in the constitution  in the temperament  of the two Sexes  that gives to the one advantages which it denies to the other  But we may not too closely pursue this subject  tho  the result  I am apt to believe  would put the matter out of dispute  Let us be more at large  Why has nature made a difference in the beauty  proportion  and symmetry  in the persons of the two Sexes  Why gave it delicacy  softness  grace  to that of the woman—as in the Ladies befor• me  strength  firmness  to men  a capacity to bear labour and fatigue  and courage  to protect the other
