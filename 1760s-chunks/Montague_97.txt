ill nature  and a coronet  and her death is the natural consequence of her regret  she had a soul formed for friendship  she found it not at home  her elegance of mind  and native probity  prevented her seeking it abroad  she died a melancholy victim to the tyranny of her friends  the tenderness of her heart  and her delicate sense of honor        If her father has any of the feelings of humanity left  what must he not suffer on this occasion       It is a painful consideration  my dear  that the happiness or misery of our lives are generally determined before we are proper judges of either       Restrained by custom  and the ridiculous prejudices of the world  we go with the crowd  and it is late in life before we dare to think       How happy are you and I  Lucy  in having parents  who  far from forcing our inclinations  have not even endeavored to betray us into chusing from sordid motives  They have not labored to fill our young hearts with vanity or avarice  they have left us those virtues  those amiable qualities  we received from nature  They have painted to us the charms of friendship  and not taught us to value riches above their real price        My father  indeed  checks a certain excess of romance which there is in my temper  but  at the same time  he never encouraged my receiving the addresses of any man who had only the gifts of fortune to recommend him  he even advised me  when very young  against marrying an officer in his regiment  of a large fortune  but an unworthy character       If I have any knowledge of the human heart  it will be my own fault if I am not happy with Fitzgerald        I am only afraid  that when we are married  and begin to settle into a calm  my volatile disposition will carry me back to coquetry  my passion for admiration is naturally strong  and has been increased by indulgence  for without vanity I have been extremely the taste of the men        I have a kind of an idea it won t be long before I try the strength of my resolution  for I heard papa and Fitzgerald in high consultation this morning       Do you know  that  having nobody to love but Fitzgerald  I am ten times more enamored of the dear creature than ever  My love is now like the rays of the sun collected        He is so much here  I wonder I don t grow tired of him  but somehow he has the art of varying himself beyond any man I ever knew  it was that agreable variety of character that first struck me  I considered that with him I should have all the sex in one  he says the same of me  and indeed  it must be owned we have both an infinity of agreable caprice  which in love affairs is worth all the merit in the world       Have you never observed  Lucy  that the same person is seldom greatly the object of both love and friendship       Those virtues which command esteem do not often inspire passion       Friendship seeks the more real  more solid virtues  integrity  constancy  and a steady uniformity of character  love  on the contrary  admires it knows not what  creates itself the idol it worships  finds charms even in defects  is pleased with follies  with inconsistency  with caprice  to say all in one line     Love is a child  and like a child he plays           The moment Emily arrives  I entreat that one of you will write to me  no words can speak my impatience  I am equally anxious to hear of my dear Rivers  Heaven send them prosperous gales       Adieu   Your faithful  A  FERMOR     LETTER CLVII   157   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   Silleri  June 30   YOU are extremely mistaken  my dear  in your idea of the society here  I had rather live at Quebec  take it for all in all  than in any town in England  except London  the manner of living here is uncommonly agreable  the scenes about us are lovely  and the mode of amusements make us taste those scenes in full perfection       Whilst your brother and Emily were here  I had not a wish to leave Canada  but their going has left a void in my heart  which will not easily be filled up  I have loved Emily almost from childhood  and there is a peculiar tenderness in those friendships  which    Grow with our growth  and strengthen with our strength     There was also something romantic and agreable in finding her here  and unexpectedly  after we had been separated by Colonel Montague s having left the regiment in which my father served         In short  every thing concurred to make us dear to each other  and therefore to give a greater poignancy to the pain of parting a second time       As to your
