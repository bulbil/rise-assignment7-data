Charles Grandison  my dear  has travelled we may say  to some purpose   Well might his sister tell Mr  Reeves  that whenever he married  he would break half a score hearts   Upon my word Lucy  he has too many personal advantages for a woman who loved him with peculiarity  to be easy with  whatever may be his virtue  from the foible our sex in general love to indulge for handsome men  For  O my dear  womens eyes are sad giddy things  and will run away with their sense  with their understandings  beyond the power of being overtaken either by stop theif  or hue and cry   I know that here you will bid me take care not to increase the number of the giddy  And so I will  my Lucy   The good sense of this real fine gentleman is not  as I can find  rusted over by sourness  by moroseness  He is above quarreling with the world for trifles  But he is still more above making such compliances with it  as would impeach either his honour or conscience  Once Miss Grandison  speaking of her brother  said  My brother is valued by those who know him best  not so much for being an handsome man  not so   256 much for his birth and fortune  nor for this or that single worthiness  as for being  in the great and yet comprehensive sense of the word  a good man  And at another time she said  that he lived to himself  and to his own heart  and that tho  he had the happiness to please every body  yet he made the judgement or approbation of the world matter but of second consideration  In a word  added she  Sir Charles Grandison  my Brother  and when she looks proud  it is when she says  my Brother  is not to be misled either by false glory  or false shame  which he calls  The great snares of virtue   What a man is this  so to act —What a woman is this  so to distinguish her brother s excellencies   What a poor creature am I  compared to either of them  And yet I have had my admirers  So perhaps may still more faulty creatures among their inferiors  If  my Lucy  we have so much good sense as to make fair comparisons  what have we to do but to look forward rather than backward  in order to obtain the grace of humility   But let me tell you  my dear  that Sir Charles does not look to be so great a self denier  as his sister seems to think him  when she says  he lives to himself  and to his own heart  rather than to the opinion of the world   He dresses to the fashion  rather richly   tis true  than gaudily  but still richly  So that he gives his fine person its full consideration  He has a great deal of vivacity in his whole aspect  as well as in his eye  Mrs  Jenny says  that he is a great admirer of handsome women  His equi is perfectly in taste  tho  not so much to the glare of taste  as if he aimed either to inspire or shew emulation  He seldom travels without a set  and suitable attendants  and  what I think seems a little to favour of singularity  his horses are not docked  Their tails are only tied up when they are on the road  This I took notice of when we came   257 to town  I want  methinks  my dear  to find some fault in his outward appearance  were it but to make you think me impartial  my gratitude to him  and my veneration for him  notwithstanding   But if he be of opinion that the tails of these noble animals are not only a natural ornament  but are of real use to defend them from the vexatious insects that in summer are so apt to annoy them  as Jenny just now told me was thought to be his reason for not depriving his cattle of a defence  which nature gave them  how far from a dispraise is this humane consideration  And how  in the more minute  as well as we may suppose in the greater instances  does he deserve the character of the man of mercy  who will be merciful to his beast   I have met with persons  who call those men good  that yet allow themselves in liberties which no good man can take  But I dare say  that Miss Grandison means by good  when she calls her brother  with so much pride  a good man  what I  and what you  my Lucy  would understand by the word   With so much spirit  life  and gallantry in the first appearance of Sir Charles Grandison  you may suppose  that had I not been so dreadfully terrified and illused  and so justly apprehensive of worse treatment  and had I been offered another protection  I should hardly have acted the frighted bird flying from the hawk  to which  as Mr  Reeves tells me  Sir Charles  tho  politely  and kindly enough  yet too sensibly for my recollection
