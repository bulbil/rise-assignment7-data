flagrant misconduct of his friend to attempt excusing him  he contented himself with repeating  It was the strangest thing he ever knew in his life   My mother then told him Mr Arnold was come to town  and that  as things had taken such a turn  she hoped herself to be able to bring him to the use of his judgment  and therefore thought it would not be at all necessary for my brother to interfere  Sir George said  With all his heart  if her ladyship should be able to patch up a reconciliation that would save his sister’s credit  and she could be so extremely pliant as to think of living with such a husband again  he should not give himself any farther trouble about the matter  but  in his opinion  the affair wore a much odder aspect than it did before  I find Mr Faulkland’s behaviour sticks with him  and has a little cooled his zeal towards him   November 25  I have had a letter from Patty  who confirms my Lady V——’s account of the lovers flight  and she tells me one of Mrs Gerrarde’s servants is gone off express to town  I suppose  to bring Mr Arnold the news  for they are all in confusion at her house  and know not what is become of their mistress  but they are certain she is gone with Mr Faulkland  Patty adds  The servants believe this scheme had long been concerted  Mr Faulkland having been a private visitor to their mistress for a good while   I must confess I am astonished at it  it has sunk the man extremely in my opinion   November 26  Miss Burchell has just been here  Poor creature  she is quite stunned with the news  she could scarce believe it at first  till my mother desired I would shew her Lady V——’s letter  and Patty’s  which corroborated all she said  She then gave way to tears and lamentations  saying  That cruel woman was born to be the destruction of every body she had any connection with  I have found it so  you  madam  to me   have done so too  Mr Arnold  I believe  has been a great sufferer  Mr Faulkland is now her victim  Inconsiderate and barbarous as he is  I grieve for him     November 30  I have heard nothing of Mr Arnold  Indeed it is hardly possible that I should  we are shut up here from all commerce with the world  My mother’s illness has confined her to her bed chamber  we admit no visitors  and I never leave her  I long to know how he takes the ingratitude of his mistress  but I see nobody who converses with him  My brother and Miss Burchell are the only people we see  The latter is pretty often with us  as for Sir George  he only looks in upon us now and then  and we all seem in an aukward situation  I wish my mother were well enough to call on Mr Arnold  I am very anxious to know what his sentiments are  at least in regard to Mrs Gerrarde   December 6  I have been almost asleep  my dear Cecilia  for this week past  but I have been rouzed this morning in a most extraordinary manner  Sir George called on us  he ran up stairs in a violent hurry  and had a countenance  when he entered the room  that spoke wonders before he opened his mouth  He hardly gave himself time to ask me how I did  though he had not seen me for three days   before he took a bundle of papers out of his pocket  which he gave me  ’Tis from Faulkland  said he  and may be worth your knowlege  Upon opening the cover  I found it contained  at least  four sheets of paper  written on every side  Bless me  brother  said I  do you expect I should take the trouble to read all this  He answered  You may read it at your leisure  you will find it will pay you for the mighty trouble of a perusal  Sir George left me presently  and having read this extraordinary letter to myself  for I happened to be in my own room when my brother came to me  I sate me down to give you a copy of it  My mother  who coughed almost the whole night  is now endeavouring to get a little sleep  so that I will scribble on as fast as I can  while I have no interruption   Boulogne  Nov  30  1704   My dear Bidulph   I am in haste to vindicate myself to you  but in much more haste to do so to Mrs Arnold  who  if she bestows a thought at all on me  must  I am sure  hold me in the utmost contempt  and great reason would she have  if things were always as they appear  Methinks I see her beautiful scorn at hearing I had carried off Mrs Gerrarde  What a paltry fellow you must think me too  And yet I have carried her off     and she is now in my possession  not displeased with her situation  and I might  if I would  be as happy
