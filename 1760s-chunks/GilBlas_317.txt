promised myself to satisfy the first time he went to Toledo  as he generally did once a week  I waited impatiently for the day  but as yet  without any other motive than the mere desire of prying  At last the good man went his way  and I unpicked his pillow  where I found  among the stuffing  the amount of about fifty crowns in all sorts of coin   This treasure must have accumulated from the gratitude of the peasantry  whom the hermit had cured by his nostrums  and of their wives  who had be come pregnant by virtue of his spiritual interference  But however it got there  I no sooner set my eyes on the money  which might be mine without any one near me to say nay  than the gipsy voice of nature and pedigree spoke within me  An inextinguishable itch of pilfering tingled in my veins  and proved that we come into the world with the mark of our descent  and with our characters about us  I yielded to the temptation without a struggle  tied up my booty in a canvas bag where we kept our combs and night caps  then  having laid aside the hermit s and resumed my foundling s dress  got clear off from the hermitage  and hugged my bag as though it had contained the boundless treasure of the Indies   You have heard my first exploit  continued Scipio  and I doubt not but you will expect a succession of similar practices  Your anticipations will not be disappointed  for there are many such evidences of genius behind  before I come to those of my actions which prove me good as well as clever  but I shall come to them  and you will be convinced by the sequel  that a scoundrel born may be licked into virtue  as the cub of a bear into shape   Child as I was  I knew better than to take the Toledo road  it would have been exposing myself to the hazard of meeting friar Chrysostom  who would have balanced accounts with me on a very thriftless principle  I therefore travelled in another direction leading to the village of Galves  where I stopped at an inn  kept by a landlady who was a widow of forty  and hung out the bunch of grapes to a very good purpose  This good woman no sooner kenned me  than  judging by my dress that I must be a truant from the orphan school  she asked who I was and whither I was going  I answered that  having lost my father and mother  I was looking for a place  Can you read  my dear  said she  I assured her that I could read  and write too  with the best of them  In point of fact  I could just form my letters  and join them so as to look a little like writing  and that was clerkship enough for a village pothouse  Then I will take you into my service  replied the hostess  You may earn your board easily enough  by scoring up the customers  and keeping my ledger  I shall give you no wages  because this inn is frequented by very genteel company  who never forget the waiters  You may reckon upon very considerable perquisites   I clenched the bargain  reserving to myself  as you may suppose  the right of emigration whenever my abode at Galves should cease to be pleasant  No sooner was I settled in my place  than a weight lay heavy on my mind  I did not wish it to be known that I had money  and it was no easy matter to devise where it could be hidden  so as that what was sauce for the goose should not be sauce for the gander  I was not yet well enough acquainted with the house to trust the places obviously most proper for such a deposit  What a source of embarrassment is great wealth  I determined  however  on a corner of our granary under some straw  and believing it to be safer there than anywhere else  made myself as easy about it as I well could   The household consisted of three servants  a lubberly ostler  a young Galician chambermaid  and myself  Each of us spunged what we could upon travellers  whether on foot or on horseback  I always came in for some small change  when the bill was paid  Then the equestrians gave something to the ostler  for taking care of their beasts  but as for our female fellow servant  the muleteers who passed that way chucked her under the chin  and gave her more crowns than we got farthings  I had no sooner realized a penny  than away it went to the granary  and slept with its precursors  so that the higher rose my heap  the more greedy did my little heart become  Sometimes would I kiss the hallowed images of my idolatry  and look at them with a devotional glow  which few worshippers feel  but those whose religion is their gold   This inordinate passion sent me back and fore to gratify it  at least thirty times a day  I often met the landlady on the staircase  She  being naturally of a suspicious temper  had a mind to find out one day what could carry me every minute to the corn loft
