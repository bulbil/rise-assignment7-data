  Page  37  In the estimation of here and there a man of weak judgment  it was greatly in the parson s power to have helped the figure of this horse of his —for he was master of a very handsome demi peak d saddle  quilted on the seat with green plush  garnished with a double row of silver headed studs  and a noble pair of shining brass stirrups  with a housing altogether suitable  of grey superfine cloth  with an edging of black lace  terminating in a deep  black  silk fringe  poudrè d or —all which he had purchased in the pride and prime of his life  together with a grand embossed bridle  ornamented at all points as it should be —But not caring to banter his beast  he had hung all these up behind his study door —and  in lieu of them  had seriously befitted him with just such a bridle and such  Page  38  a saddle  as the figure and value of such a steed might well and truly deserve   In the several sallies about his parish  and in the neighbouring visits to the gentry who lived around him —you will easily comprehend  that the parson  so appointed  would both hear and see enough to keep his philosophy from rusting  To speak the truth  he never could enter a village  but he caught the attention of both old and young —Labour stood still as he pass d —the bucket hung suspended in the middle of the well —the spinning wheel forgot its round —even chuck farthing and shuffle cap themselves stood gaping till he had got out of sight  and as his movement was not of the quickest  he had generally time enough upon his hands to make his observations —to hear  Page  39  the groans of the serious —and the laughter of the light hearted —all which he bore with excellent tranquility —His character was —he loved a jest in his heart—and as he saw himself in the true point of ridicule  he would say  he could not be angry with others for seeing him in a light  in which he so strongly saw himself  So that to his friends  who knew his foible was not the love of money  and who therefore made the less scruple in bantering the extravagance of his humour —instead of giving the true cause —he chose rather to join in the laugh against himself  and as he never carried one single ounce of flesh upon his own bones  being altogether as spare a figure as his beast —he would sometimes insist upon it  that the horse was as good as the rider deserved —that they were  centaur like —both of a piece  At other  Page  40  times  and in other moods  when his spirits were above the temptation of false wit —he would say  he found himself going off fast in a consumption  and  with great gravity  would pretend  he could not bear the sight of a fat horse without a dejection of heart  and a sensible alteration in his pulse  and that he had made choice of the lean one he rode upon  not only to keep himself in countenance  but in spirits   At different times he would give fifty humourous and opposite reasons for riding a meek spirited jade of a brokenwinded horse  preferably to one of mettle —for on such a one he could sit mechanically  and meditate as delightfully de vanitate mundi et fugâ saeculi  as with the advantage of a death s head before him —that  in all other exercitations  he  Page  41  could spend his time  as he rode slowly along —to as much account as in his study —that he could draw up an argument in his sermon —or a hole in his breeches  as steadily on the one as in the other —that brisk trotting and slow argumentation  like wit and judgment  were two incompatible movements —But that upon his steed—he could unite and reconcile every thing —he could compose his sermon —he could compose his cough —and  in case nature gave a call that way  he could likewise compose himself to sleep —In short  the parson upon such encounters would assign any cause  but the true cause —and he withheld the true one  only out of a nicety of temper  because he thought it did honour to him   Page  42  But the truth of the story was as follows  In the first years of this gentleman s life  and about the time when the superb saddle and bridle were purchased by him  it had been his manner  or vanity  or call it what you will —to run into the opposite extream —In the language of the county where he dwelt  he was said to have loved a good horse  and generally had one of the best in the whole parish standing in his stable always ready for saddling  and as the nearest midwife  as I told you  did not live nearer to the village than seven miles  and in a vile country —it so fell out that the poor gentleman was scarce a whole week together without some piteous application for his beast  and as he was not an unkind hearted man  and every case was more pressing and more distressful than the last —as much as he loved his beast   Page  43  he had never a heart to refuse him  the upshot of which
