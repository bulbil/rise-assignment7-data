by such appetites  none but the ignorant inveigh against them   You are not insensible  most reverend Fum Hoam  what numberless trades  even among the Chinese  subsist by the harmless pride of each other  Your nose borers  feet swathers  tooth stainers  eye brow pluckers  would all want bread  should their neighbours want vanity  These vanities  however  employ much fewer hands in China than in England  and a fine gentleman  or a fine lady  here dressed up to the fashion  seems scarcely to have a single limb that does not suffer some distortions from art   To make a fine gentleman  several trades are required  but chiefly a barber  you have undoubtedly heard of the Jewish champion  whose strength lay in his hair  one would think that the English were for placing all wisdom there  To appear wise  nothing more is requisite here than for a man to borrow hair from the heads of all his neighbours  and clap it like a bush on his own  the distributors   8 of law and physic stick on such quantities  that it is almost impossible  even in idea  to distinguish between the head and the hair   Those whom I have been now describing  affect the gravity of the lion  those I am going to describe more resemble the pert vivacity of smaller animals  The barber  who is still master of the ceremonies  cuts their hair close to the crown  and then with a composition of meal and hog s lard  plaisters the whole in such a manner  as to make it impossible to distinguish whether the patient wears a cap or a plaister  but to make the picture more perfectly striking  conceive the tail of some beast  a greyhound s tail  or a pig s tail for instance  appended to the back of the head  and reaching down to that place where tails in other animals are generally seen to begin  thus betailed and bepowdered  the man of taste fancies he improves in beauty  dresses up his hard featured face in smiles  and attempts to look hideously tender  Thus equipped  he is qualified to make love  and hopes for success more from the powder on the outside of his head  than the sentiments within   Yet when I consider what sort of a creature the fine lady is  to whom he is supposed to pay his addresse•  it is not strange to find him thus equipped in order to please  She is herself every whit as fond of powder  and tails  and hog s lard as he  to speak my secret sentiments  most reverend Fum  the ladies here are horridly ugly  I can hardly endure the sight of them  they no way resemble the beauties of China  the Europeans have a quite different idea of beauty from us  when I reflect on the small footed perfections of an Eastern beauty  how is it possible I should have eyes for a woman   9 whose feet are ten inches long  I shall never forget the beauties of my native city of Nangfew  How very broad their faces  how very short their noses  how very little their eyes  how very thin their lips  how very black their teeth  the snow on the tops of Bao is not fairer than their cheeks  and their eye brows are small as the line by the pencil of Quamsi  Here a lady with such perfections would be frightful  Dutch and Chinese beauties indeed have some resemblance  but English women are entirely different  red cheeks  big eyes  and teeth of a most odious whiteness  are not only seen here  but wished for  and then they have such masculine feet  as actually serve some for walking   Yet uncivil as nature has been  they seem resolved to outdo her in unkindness  they use white powder  blue powder  and black powder for their hair  and a red powder for the face on some particular occasions   They like to have the face of various colours  as among the Tartars of Koreki  frequently sticking on  with spittle  little black patches on every part of it  except on the tip of the nose  which I have never seen with a patch  You ll have a better idea of their manner of placing these spots  when I have finished a map of an English face patch d up to the fashion  which shall shortly be sent to encrease your curious collection of paintings  medals  and monsters   But what surprizes more than all the rest  is  what I have just now been credibly informed by one of this country   Most ladies here  says he  have two faces  one face to sleep in  and another to shew in company  the first is generally reserv d   10 for the husband and family at home  the other put on to please strangers abroad  the family face is often indifferent enough  but the out door one ••oks something better  this is always made at the toilet  where the looking glass  and toad eater sit in council and settle the complexion of the day    I can t ascertain the truth of this remark  however  it is actually certain  that they wear more cloaths within doors than without  and I have
