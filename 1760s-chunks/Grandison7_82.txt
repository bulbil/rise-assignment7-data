s Letter  that you will not subscribe implicitly to my determination —But I will not spare you  In my condemnation of them  read your own  I have written my answer  and shall inclose it  and no more at present trouble myself about them   But here  I  Charlotte G  who married with indifference   210 the poor Lord G   who made the honest man  whenever I pleased  foam  fume  fret  and execrate the hour that he first beheld my face  now stand forth  an example of true conjugal felicity  and an encouragement for girls who venture into the married state  without that prodigious quantity of violent passion  which some hare brained creatures think as essential of Love   You  my dear  left us tolerably happy  But now we are almost in tolerably so  I had begun to recover my spirits  depressed  as they had been  for near a month before  on finding myself  like any common woman  confined to my chamber  while every other mouth sang O be joyful  and one was preparing  another was set out  and half a score more were actually got to dear Grandison hall  I bit my lip  and raved at the wretch to whom I attributed my durance  When  yesterday  after a series indeed of the most obliging and most grateful behaviour  that a man ever expressed for a Present made him  which he holds invaluable  he entered my chamber  and surprised me  as I did him  for I intended that he should know nothing of the matter  nor that I would ever be so condescending   surprised me  as how  Ah  Harriet  In an act that confessed the mother  the whole mother —Little Harriet at my breast  or  at my neck  I believe I should say—should I not   The nurse  the nursery maids  knowing that I would not for the world have been so caught by my nimble Lord  for he is in twenty places in a minute  were more affrighted than Diana s nymphs  when the goddess was surprised by Acteon  and each  instead of surrounding me in order to hide my blushes  was for running a different way  not so much as attempting to relieve me from the Brat   I was ready to let the little Leech drop from my arms—O wretch  screamed I—Begone —begone  Whence the boldness of this intrusion     211 Never was man in a greater rapture  For Lady Gertrude had taught him to wish that a mother would be a mother  He threw himself at my feet  clasping me and the little varlet together in his arms  Brute  said I  will you smother my Harriet—I was halfashamed of my tenderness—Dear est  dear est  dear est Lady G —Shaking his head  between every dear and est  every muscle of his face working  how you transport me —Never  never  never  saw I so delightful a sight  Let me  let me  let me  every emphatic word repeated three times at least  behold again the dear sight  Let me see you clasp the precious gift  our Harriet s Harriet too  to that lovely bosom—The wretch  trembling however  pulled aside my handkerchief  I try d to scold  but was forced to press the little thing to me  to supply the place of the handkerchief—Do you think  I could not have killed him —To be sure  I was not half angry enough  I knew not what I did  you may well think—for I bowed my face on the smiling infant  who crowed to the pressure of my lips   Begone  Lord G  said I—See  see  how shall I hold the little Marmouset  if you devour first one of my hands  then the other   He arose  took the little thing from me  kissed its forehead  its cheeks  its lips  its little pudsey hands  first one  then the other  gave it again to my arms  took it again  and again resigned it to me   Take away the pug  said I  to the attendants—Take it away  while any of it is left—They rescued the still smiling babe  and run away with it   My Lord then again threw himself at my feet—Pardon  pardon me  dearest creature  said he  that I took amiss any thing you ever said or did—You that could make me such rich amends—O let not those charming  charming spirits ever subside  which for a fortnight together  till yesterday  I missed  I loved you too well  proceeded he  to take any usage that was   212 not quite what I wished it  lightly  But for some time past I have seen that it was all owing to a vivacity  that now  in every instants of it  delights my soul  You never  never  had malice or ill nature in what I called your petulance  You bore with mine  You smiled at me  Henceforth every thing you say  every thing you do  will I take for a favour  O my Charlotte  Never  never more shall it be in your power to make me so far forget myself  as to be angry   My dear
