popularity  but the rejoicings made for the succession of his son  Henry V  were manifest and sincere  This Prince was their favourite  notwithstanding the profligacy of his youth  in the very height of riot and extravagance  he would  sometimes  give instances of the sublimest virtues  But his courage seemed to be what peculiarly won their affection and esteem  at this barbarous period  courage seemed to be regarded as the only virtue  courage and superstition then made up the whole system of human duty  and stamped the character of heroism   The people of Europe were  by this time  degenerated from what they were even two hundred years before  a continuance of war had blotted out the very traces of morality  The vices of the clergy had drawn upon them contempt and opposition  which they returned  not by refoming themselves  but by persecuting those who opposed   162 them  This reign was begun in attempting to extirpate the heresy of Wickliffe  John Oldcastle  baron of Cobham  was the most considerable protector of this sect  he was the King s domestic  and stood highly in his favour  The Archbishop of Canterbury  therefore  undertook to prejudice him in the royal opinion  and endeavoured to persuade the young Monarch  that fire and faggot were the only instruments that were capable of saving an heretic from future damnation  and that Oldcastle s opinions deserved the severest punishments of the law  The King was  at length  persuaded to talk with Oldcastle in private  and  finding him immoveable  gave him up to the fury of his enemies  Persecution ever produces those crimes which it endeavours to abolish  Oldcastle was condemned  but  escaping  was obliged to become  in fact  that guilty person which they had at first falsly represented him  he headed a body of malecontents  and refused to be demeanable to royal power  This unhappy man  after a variety of distresses  at length fell into the power of his enemies  and never did the cruelty of man invent  or the crimes of the delinquent draw down  more torments than he was made to endure  he was hung up with a chain by the middle  and  by a slow fire  burned  or  rather  roasted alive   Such spectacles as these  must naturally produce a disgust in the people  both to the government and the clergy  but  to turn their minds from these hideous spectacles  Henry was resolved to take advantage of the troubles in which France was  at that time  involved  Charles  who was then King of France  was subject to frequent fits of lunacy  which totally disqualified him from reigning  in these intervals the ambition of his vassals   163 and courtiers had room for exertion  and they grew powerful from the weakness of their King  Isabella  of Bavaria  his wife  was at the head of one faction  the Duke of Burgundy of another  the faction of the children of the Duke of Orleans was considerable  that only  which held by the King  was feeble  Each of these  as they happened to prevail  branded their captives with the names of traitors  and the gibbets were at once hung with the bodies of the accused and the accusers   This was thought a most favourable opportunity to rescue  from France  those grants that had formerly been given up by treaty  Henry  therefore  invaded that kingdom  with an army of fifty thousand men  He took Harfleur  and advanced into a country already rendered desolate by factions  and which he now totally laid waste by a foreign invasion  but  tho  the enemy made but a feeble resistance  yet the climate seemed to fight for them  a contagious dysentery carried off three parts of Henry s soldiers  In such a situation  he had recourse to an expedient common enough in the barbarous times I am describing  he challenged the Dauphin to single combat  offering to stake his pretensions on the event  this challenge  as might naturally be expected  was rejected  and the French  tho  disagreeing internally  now seemed to unite at the appearance of foreign danger   Henry soon began to repent of his rash inroad into a country  where disease  and a powerful army  every moment threatened destruction  and  therefore  thought of retiring to Calais  In this retreat  which was at once both painful and dangerous  Henry took every method to inspire his troops with courage and perseverance  and shewed   164 them  in himself  an example of patience and resignation  In the mean time the French army was drawn up to obstruct his passage  nor was there any possibility of his passing them without a battle  yet  even that could promise but small hopes of victory  his army was wasted with disease  their spirits worn down with fatigue  destitute of provisions  and but nine thousand in number  to sustain the shock of an enemy amounting to an hundred and fifty thousand  This disparity  as it raised the courage of the French  so it impressed the English with terror  So confident were the French leaders of success  that they began to treat for the ransom of their prisoners  on the 25th of October  1415  the
