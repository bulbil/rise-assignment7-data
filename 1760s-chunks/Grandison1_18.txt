 What may be the end of all this  but to make a compassionate nature  as mine has been thought to be  if Mr  Fowler should be greatly in earnest  uneasy to itself  in being obliged to shew Pity  where she cannot return Love   What I have said  I have said  replied Mr  Reeves  Pity is but one remove from Love  Mrs  Reeves  There she sits  was first brought to pity me  for never was man more madly in love than I  and then I thought myself sure of her  And so it proved  I can tell you I am no enemy to Mr  Fowler   And so  my dear  Mr  Fowler seems to think he has met with a woman who would make a fit wife for him  But your Harriet  I doubt  has not in Mr    40 Fowler met with a man whom she can think a fit Husband for her   The very next morning  Sir Rowland himself—  But now  my Lucy  if I proceed to tell you all the fine things that are said of me and to me  what will my uncle Selhy say  Will he not attribute all I shall repeat of this sort  to that pride  to that vanity  to that sondness of admiration  which he  as well as Mr  Greville  is continually charging upon all our Sex   Yet he expects that I shall give a minute account of every thing that passes  and of every conversation in which I have any part  How shall I do to please him  And yet I know I shall best please him  if I give him room to find fault with me  But then should he for my faults blame the whole Sex  Is that just   You will tell me  I know  that if I give speeches and conversations  I ought to give them justly  That the humours and characters of persons cannot be known unless I repeat what they say  and their manner of saying  That I must leave it to the speakers and complimenters to answer for the likeness of the pictures they draw  That I know best my own heart  and whether I am puffed up by the praises given me  That if I am  I shall discover it by my superciliousness  and be enough punished on the discovery  by incurring  from those I love  deserved blame  if not contempt  instead of preserving their wished for esteem —Let me add to all this  that there is an author  I forget who  who says     It is lawful to repeat those things  tho  spoken in our praise  that are necessary to be known  and cannot otherwise be come at      And now let me ask  Will this preamble do  once for all   It will  And so says my aunt Selby  And so says every one but my uncle  Well then  I will proceed  and repeat all that shall be said  and that as well to my disadvantage as advantage  only resolving not to be exalted with the one  and to do my endeavour to   41 amend by the other  And here  pray tell my uncle  that I do not desire he will spare me  since the faults he shall find in his Harriet shall always put her upon her guard—Not  however  to conceal them from his discerning eye  but to amend them   And now  having  as I said  once for all  prepared you to guard against a surfeit of self praise  tho  delivered at second or third hand  I will go on with my narrative—But hold—my paper reminds me  that I have written a monstrous letter—I will therefore  with a new sheet  begin a new one  Only adding to this  that I am  and ever will be   Your affectionate HARRIET BYRON   P  S  Well  but what shall I do now —I have just received my uncle s Letter  And  after his charge upon me of Vanity and Pride  will my parade  as above  stand me in any stead —I must trust to it  Only one word to my dear and everhonoured uncle—Don t you  Sir  impute to me a belief of the truth of those extravagant compliments made by men professing Love to me  and I will not wish you to think me one bit the wiser  the handsomer  the better for them  than I was before   LETTER IX  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   Thursday  Feb  2   THE very next morning Sir Rowland himself paid his respects to Mr  Reeves   The knight  before he would open himself very freely as to the business he came upon  desired that he might have an opportunity to see me  I knew nothing of him  nor of his business  We were just going to breakfast  Miss Allestree  Miss Bramber  and Miss Dolyns  a young Lady of merit  were with us     42 Just as we had taken our seats  Mr  Reeves introduced Sir Rowland  but let him not know which was Miss Byron  He did nothing at first sitting down
