or gain  by not permitting the duty of one penny in  the pound  old subsidy  to be drawn back  on tobacco  re exported  He  demonstrated to the ministry of that time  that so inconsiderable a duty  could not in the least diminish the demand from abroad  which was the  only circumstance to be apprehended  and that the yearly produce of that  revenue would amount to one hundred and twenty thousand pounds  without  one shilling additional expense to the public  but the ministry having  the excise scheme then in contemplation  could think of no other till  that should be tried  and that project having miscarried  he renewed his  application  when they approved of his scheme in every particular  but  discovered a surprising backwardness to carry it into execution    His expectations in this quarter being disappointed  he  by the  interposition of his friends  presented a plan to the French company  in  which he set forth the advantages that would accrue to themselves from  fixing the price  and securing that sort of tobacco which best suited  the taste of the public and their manufacture  and finally proposed to  furnish them with any quantity  at the price which they paid in the port  of London    After some dispute  they agreed to this proposal  and contracted  with him for fifteen thousand hogsheads a year  for which they obliged  themselves to pay ready money  on its arrival in any one or more  convenient ports in the south or western coasts of Great Britain that he  should please to fix upon for that purpose  M   no sooner obtained this  contract  than he immediately set out for America  in order to put it  in execution  and  by way of companion  carried with him a little French  abbe  a man of humour  wit  and learning  with whom he had been long  acquainted  and for whom he had done many good offices    On his arrival in Virginia  which opportunely happened at a time when    6 22 15  3 45 PM   all the gentlemen were assembled in the capital of that province  he  published a memorial  representing the disadvantages under which their  trade was carried on  the true method of redressing their own grievances  in that respect  and proposing to contract with them for the yearly  quantity of fifteen thousand hogsheads of such tobacco as was fit for  the French market  at the price which he demonstrated to be considerably  greater than that which they had formerly received  This remonstrance  met with all the success and encouragement he could expect  The  principal planters  seeing their own interest concerned  readily  assented to the proposal  which  through their influence  was also  relished by the rest  and the only difficulty that remained  related to  the security for payment of the bills on the arrival of the tobacco in  England  and to the time stipulated for the continuance of the contract    In order to remove these objections  Mr  M   returned to Europe  and  found the French company of farmers disposed to agree to everything he  desired for facilitating the execution of the contract  and perfectly  well pleased with the sample which he had already sent  but his  good friend the abbe  whom he had left behind him in America  by an  unparalleled piece of treachery  found means to overturn the whole  project  He secretly wrote a memorial to the company  importing  that he  found  by experience  M   could afford to furnish them at a much lower  price than that which they had agreed to give  and that  by being in  possession of the contract for five years  as was intended according to  the proposal  he would have the company so much in his power  that they  must afterwards submit to any price he should please to impose  and  that  if they thought him worth of such a trust  he would undertake to  furnish them at an easier rate  in conjunction with some of the leading  men in Virginia and Maryland  with whom  he said  he had already  concerted measures for that purpose    The company were so much alarmed at these insinuations  that they  declined complying with Mr  M   s demands until the abbe s return  and   though they afterwards used all their endeavours to persuade him to be  concerned with that little traitor in his undertaking  by which he  might still have been a very considerable gainer  he resisted all their  solicitations  and plainly told them  in the abbe s presence  that  he would never prostitute his own principles so far  as to enter into  engagements of any kind with a person of his character  much less in a  scheme that had a manifest tendency to lower the market price of tobacco  in England    Thus ended a project the most extensive  simple  and easy  and  as  appeared by the trial made  the best calculated to raise an immense  fortune of any that was ever undertaken or
