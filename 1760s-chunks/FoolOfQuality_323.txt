 barterers and com    muters  buyers and sellers  manufacturers and merchants  like   Pyramus and Thisbe  want nothing but the removal of envious   obstacles to meet and to multiply a similar progeny      From what has been premised  my lord  it is most evident that   industry is the parent of the wealth of this world  That no man s   industry is sufficient to his own occasions  That the mutual   assistance denominated commerce is  therefore  necessary to the   well being of all people  That the reciprocal advantage of this   commerce consists in supplying mutual wants with mutual redun    dancies  That this commerce  however  cannot be carried on   without a medium for the conveyance of such supplies  That such   a medium by land  even where it is practicable  is tedious  toilsome    expensive  extremely discouraging  and cannot be pushed to any   considerable extent or effect  That God  however  hath opened   for the purpose an easy  speedy  and universal medium of seas  lakes    and rivers  part of which he hath left unnavigable  that man might   finish by art what nature had prepared  and contribute in some   degree to his own advantages  That  accordingly  China and   Holland  and France of late  have pursued the path so divinely   appointed  and that power  wealth  and prosperity have flowed in   upon them  in proportion as they have opened the medium of   water carriage for their reception  And that causes which have   produced their concomitant effects  without variation  from the   earliest ages to the present period  must be presumed to produce   the like effects through all countries and ages to the end of time      I protest  Mr  Meekly  exclaimed the earl  you have pushed this   matter into mathematical demonstration  What a happy what a   glorious prospect now opens to my view   How easily  how speedily    how profitably  might this method be put in execution throughout   the earth   There is no deficiency of rivers or collateral streams for   the purpose  The sinking into the earth would give vent to new   springs  and extract plenty of water in all places for an inland   navigation   and half the number of hands that perish through war   and want  might be peacefully and plentifully employed in ac    complishing this weal of mankind  Famine and depredation would         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  355     then cease  Nation would no longer rise up against nation  nor   man against man  The earth  by culture  would soon become   capable of sustaining tenfold the number of its present inhabitants    We should no more be tempted to push each other from existence    We should find ourselves mutually interested in preserving and   multiplying the lives of all from whose labours we were to derive   such advantages  All would be plenty  all peace and benevolence   throughout the globe  The number of inhabitants  instead of being   a burden  would then become the riches of every climate  All   hands would be set to work  when thus assured of a purchaser for   every effect of labour  The buzz of wheels  reels  and looms   the   sound of hammers  files  and forges   with the shouts of vintage and   the songs of harvest  would be heard in all lands  I am quite   astonished that a work  so full of benefit and blessing to the   universe of man  is not already commenced  advanced  and complete      How comes this to pass  Mr  Meekly  have you yet mentioned   this matter to any of our great ones       I have  my lord  to several  They confessed themselves convinced   of the utility of the scheme   and  could each of them be assured   of engrossing to himself the most considerable part of the profits   that would thereby accrue to the public  the work would instantly   be begun  and would shortly be perfected  For  such is the nature   of unregenerate man  that he grudges to others any portion of those   goods which he so eagerly craves and grapples after for himself    He would hedge in the air  and make a property of the light    In proportion as he sees his neighbours in comparative want  he   exults in the accumulation of imaginary wealth  But should he   deem them  in a measure  more prosperous than himself  he sighs   at his inmost soul  and grows wretched and repining      I protest  cried the earl  were I young  I would to morrow   morning  at my own cost  set about this great work of national
