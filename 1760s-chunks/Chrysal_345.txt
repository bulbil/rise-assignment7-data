  that laid his life at the mercy of this his supposed friend      There are some crimes  the consequences of which are so dangerous    that no punishment can be too severe to deter from them  One   of the worst of these is imitating a man s signature  with a design   to deceive  It perpetuates the violation of truth  undermines the   security of innocence  and breaks that confidence which is indis    pensably necessary to carry on the concerns of life  But  though   no circumstance can  in a legal sense  extenuate the heinousness of   this crime  there were some  in this particular instance  which would   have deterred any other man from the prosecution of it  It had   been committed not with an intention of doing injustice to him   or any other  but to remedy for a time his injustice  by raising   apparently the value of the return he had made for the gift of   their common benefactress  as I have before observed  nearer to   an equality with it  in order to procure present relief from distress    of which he had been  in so many senses  the cause  But all these   considerations were of no weight with him  when put in competi    tion with the convenience of getting rid of one whom he doubly   hated  for being privy to his iniquities  and interfering with his   interest  He hesitated not a moment  therefore  to make use of an       Dost thou contrive some blacker deed of shame    Something which nature shudders but to name    Something which makes the soul of man retreat    And the life blood run backward to her seat     Dost thou contrive  for some base private end    Some selfish view  to hang a trusting friend    To lure him on  e en to his parting breath    And promise life to work him surer death 1 â€” Lines 327 334        Forging Lord Holland s name to a lease          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 413     opportunity offered beyond his hopes  and sacrifice him  under the   specious appearance of paying obedience to the laws      In this it was necessary for him to act with the deepest dissimula    tion  to accomplish his designs in its full extent  He professed pity   for his misfortunes  and  while he corrupted all in whom the wretch   placed confidence  to betray him  managed so as to seem to be   compelled by law to appear against him  though he might with the   greatest ease have avoided it  and buried the whole in silence    Nor did he stop here  His malice seemed to pursue him even   beyond the grave  for instead of permitting him to prepare in peace   for the approach of fate  he buoyed him up with the hopes of a   pardon  to earn which the deluded victim subscribed to everything   dictated to him to blacken his own character  and make void the   grants which he had purchased at so dear a rate  And in this   infatuation he was kept to the last moment  to prevent his recanting    for which purpose his nearest friends  and all who might have im    deceived him and administered comfort to his distress in the hour   of anguish  were barred admittance to him  But his eyes were   opened on the verge of life  and in that awful moment  when truth   only is spoken  he revoked everything he had been thus drawn in   to say  and asserted the validity of the claims which were the cause   of his ruin  so that the whole scheme  laboured with such deep   damnation to deceive the world  was defeated      I see the horror with which you are affected at such a scene    and shall  therefore  close it with observing  that though he was   permitted to perpetrate his crimes  Divine Justice prevented his   reaping the fruits proposed from them   as  beside the immediate   price of his blood  it cost him more than he earned by his complicated   guilt to stop the cries of the widow and orphan  and bribe venal   defamation to silence when it was too late  and the mystery of his   wickedness was made known to the world      1 Aylifie was hanged at Tyburn in 1759  Lord Holland had treated   him with great kindness during his imprisonment and trial  supplying   him with necessaries  and pajnng the prison dues  He also sent his   own physician to attend him  and saved him from the indignity of   being ironed by providing him with a keeper  He also agreed to the   postponement of the trial  and allowed two confessions of forgery by
