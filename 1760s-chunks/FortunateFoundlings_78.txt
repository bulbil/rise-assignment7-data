prepare for her departure on   the ensuing day  It was in vain she again begged leave to see her  and   to be made acquainted with the reason of her displeasure  but the other   would not be prevailed upon  but sent her a purse sufficient to defray   the expences of her journey to England  and bid her woman tell her she   had no occasion to repine  for she turned her away in a much better   condition than she had found her             CHAP  XV        Louisa is in danger of being ravished by the count de Bellfleur  is   providentially rescued by monsieur du Plessis  with several other   particulars        Louisa packed up her things  as she had been commanded  tho  with what   confusion of mind is not easy to be expressed  and  when she was ready   to go  wrote a letter to Melanthe  thanking her for all the favours she   had received from her  acknowledging them to be as unmerited as her late   displeasure  which she conjured her to believe she had never  even in   thought  done any thing justly to incur   wished her prosperity  and   that she might never find a person less faithful to her interests than   she had been  Having desired her woman to deliver this to her  she took   leave of the servants  who all loved her extremely  and saw her go with   tears in their eyes       The rout she intended to take was to Padua by water  thence in a post   chaise to Leghorn  where she was informed  it would be easy to find a   ship bound for England  to what port was indifferent to her  being now   once more to seek her fortune  tho  in her native country  and must   trust wholly to that providence for her future support  which had   hitherto protected her       Accordingly she took her passage to Padua in one of those boats  which   are continually going between Venice and that city  and it being near   the close of day when she landed  was obliged to go into an inn    designing to lye there that night  and early in the morning set out   for Leghorn       She was no sooner in bed than  having never been alone in one of those   places before  a thousand dreadful apprehensions came into her head  all   the stories she had been told  when a child  of robberies and murders   committed on travellers in inns  were now revived in her memory   every   little noise she heard made her fall into tremblings  and the very   whistling of the wind  which at another time would have lulled her to   sleep  now kept her waking  but these ideal terrors had not long   possessed her  before she had an occasion of real ones  more shocking   than her most timid fancy could have suggested       The wicked count de Bellfleur  who had taken care to prevent the passion   he had excited in Melanthe against her from growing cool  learned  from   that deceived lady  in what manner she intended to dispose of her  and   no sooner heard which way she went than  attended by one servant  who   was the confidant and tool of all his vices  he took boat for Padua  and   presently finding out  by describing her  at what inn she was lodged    came directly thither  and  having called the man of the house  asked   him if such a young woman were not lodged there  to which being answered   in the affirmative  he told him that she was his wife   that being but   lately married to her  in compliance with her request  he had brought   her to see the diversions of the carnival  and that she was eloped  he   doubted not  but for the sake of a gallant  since he loved her too well   to have given her any cause to take so imprudent a step       The concern he seemed to be under gained immediate credit to all he   said  which he easily perceiving  I know  said he  that if I have   recourse to a magistrate I shall have a grant  and proper officers to   force her to return to her duty  but I would feign reclaim her by fair   means   it is death to me to expose her  and if my perswasions will be   effectual  the world shall never know her fault       The innkeeper then told him she was gone to bed  but he would wait on   him to her chamber  and he might call to her to bid her open the door    No
