of a cassock  with which he invested his person  But what words can express my surprise  when Signor Don Raphael presented himself to my view  like a phoenix from the ashes of the old bead counter  To complete the trick of the pantomime  brother Anthony was turned into my faithful vassal and trusty squire  Ambrose de Lamela  Here are miracles  exclaimed I in a quandary  as far as I can perceive  we are all hail fellow well met  You never were more lucky in your life  Signor Gil Blas  said Don Raphael  with a brazen faced good humour  you have fallen among old friends when you least expected it  It must be owned you have a crow to pluck with us  but let the past be buried in oblivion  and thank heaven  here we are together again  Ambrose and I will serve under your banner  and let me tell you  you will have subalterns of no contemptible prowess  You may object to our morals  but they are better in the main than many a hypocrite s pretensions  We never assassinate  and rarely maltreat  and that in pure self  defence  The only liberty we take with society is to live at free quarters  and though robbery may be considered as containing some little spice of injustice  the necessity we labour under of committing it restores its equilibrium to the scale  Even join your fortune with ours  you will lead a life of hazard  but of variety  Our predatory peregrinations have every pastoral beauty except innocence  and the want of that is more than counterpoised by subtlety and stratagem  Not but  with all our forecast  a certain mechanical concatenation of second causes sometimes frustrates our best concerted projects  and drags our philosophy through the mire  But a ducking now and then only makes us swim the better  The seasons must all be taken in their turns  the blanks as well as the prizes must be drawn in the cheating lottery of life   Courteous stranger  pursued the pretended hermit  speaking to Don Alphonso  we extend the proposal of partnership to you  and it may be a question whether you will better yourself by rejecting it  in the lamentable condition of your affairs  for  to say nothing of the chance medley for which you are at hide and seek  your fortune is probably a little out at elbows  Most lamentably so  said Don Alphonso  and hence  since the truth must out  are my forebodings more dark than even my present evils  That is the very thing  replied Don Raphael  You were sent by our better genius to join the party  You will find no such good berth in the honest part of the world  Your wants will all be supplied  and you may laugh at the vigilance of your pursuers  There is not a corner in all Spain which we have not ferreted out  those who are always on the scamper see a great deal of the country  We are perfect connoisseurs in landscape  and affect Salvator Rosa s rugged scenery  There we graze in peace and freedom  secure from the brutality of justice  Don Alphonso expressed himself very much obliged to them for their kind invitation  and finding neither money in his purse  nor contrivance to procure it in his pericranium  made up his mind at once not to stand upon punctilio with morality  I too was led into a looser course than agreed with my rigid principles  by a growing friendship for this young man  whom I could not find in my heart to abandon in so perilous an enterprise   We all four agreed to set off in a body  and never to part company  The question was put whether we should sound a retreat on the instant  or first give a peremptory summons to a flagon of excellent wine  which brother Anthony had invested by regular approaches at Cuen√ßa the day before  but Raphael  a more experienced general than any of us  represented that the first thing to be done was to render our own camp impregnable  for which purpose he proposed that we should march all night  to gain a very thick wood between Villardesa and Almodabar  where we should halt  as in a friendly country  and recruit after the fatigues of the campaign  These general orders were approved of in council  Our lay hermits then went about packing up their baggage and provisions  which were swung in two bundles across the back of Don Alphonso s horse  We were not long in our preparations  after which we sheered off from the hermitage  leaving a rich booty to legal rapine in the saintly paraphernalia of the two hermits  including a white beard and a red one  two rickety bedsteads  a table without a leg  a chest without a bottom  two chairs without any seats  and an unmutilated image of St Pacomo   Our march was continued the whole night  and we began to chafe and feel other inconveniences  when at daybreak we hailed the wood where our toils were to end  Sailors after a long voyage work the ship with double alacrity at sight of their native land  So it was with us  we pushed forward and got to our journey s end by sunrise  Dashing into the thickest of the wood  we pitched upon a retired and
