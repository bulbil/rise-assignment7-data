  but I do not know whether Mr  Goodman   may think well of it or not  for he would fain have put me off from   visiting his charge here  I soon found  by his way of speaking  the wind   did not fit fair for me from that quarter  so tacked about  shifted my   sails  and stood for the port directly         Manfully resolved  indeed   said Mr  Staple   but I hope  captain  you   have kept a good look out  in order to avoid any ship of greater burden   that might else chance to overset you     Oh  Sir  as to that   replied   the captain   you might have spared yourself the trouble of giving me   this caution  there are only two small pinks in my way  and they had   best stand clear  or I shall run foul on them        Though Mr  Staple had been apprized before hand of the captain s   pretences  and that Miss Betsy intended to encourage them only by way of   amusement to herself and friends  yet the rough manner in which his   rival had uttered these words  brought the blood into his cheeks  which   Lady Mellasin perceiving  and fearing that what was begun in jest might    in the end  become more serious than could be wished  turned the   conversation  and  addressing herself to the captain on the score of   what he had said concerning Mr  Goodman  made many apologies for her   husband s behaviour in this point  assured him  that he had not a more   sincere friend in the world  nor one who would be more ready to serve   him  in whatever was in his power       The captain had a fund of good nature in his heart  but was somewhat too   much addicted to passion  and frequently apt to resent without a cause    but when once convinced he had been in the wrong  no one could be more   ready to acknowledge and ask pardon for his mistake  He had been bred at   sea  his conversation  for almost his whole life  had been chiefly among   those of his own occupation  he was altogether unacquainted with the   manners and behaviour of the polite world  and equally a stranger to   what is called genteel raillery  as he was to courtly complaisance  It   is not  therefore  to be wondered at  that he was often rude  without   designing to be so  and took many things as affronts  which were not   meant as such       Lady Mellasin  who never wanted words  and knew how to express herself   in the most persuasive terms whenever she pleased to make use of them    had the address to convince the captain that Mr  Goodman was no enemy to   his suit  though he would not appear to encourage it       While the captain was engaged with her ladyship in this discourse  Miss   Betsy took the opportunity of telling Mr  Staple that she insisted upon   it  that he should be very civil to a rival from whose pretensions he   might be certain he had nothing to apprehend  and  moreover  that when   she gave him her hand to lead her into the concert room  he should give   his to Miss Flora  without discovering the least marks of discontent    the lover looked on this last injunction as too severe a trial of his   patience  but she would needs have it so  and he was under a necessity   of obeying  or of suffering much greater mortification from her   displeasure       Soon after this  they all four went to the entertainment in Mr    Goodman s coach  which Lady Mellasin had ordered to be got ready  The   captain was mightily pleased with the musick  and had judgment enough in   it to know it was better than the band he had on board his ship   When   they have done playing   said he   I will ask them what they will have   to go with me the next voyage   But Mr  Staple told him it would be   affront  that they were men who got more by their instruments than the   best officer either by sea or land did by his commission  This mistake    as well as many others the captain fell into  made not only the company   he was with  but those who sat near enough to hear him  a good deal of   diversion       Nothing of moment happening either here or at Mr  Goodman s  where they   all supped together  it would be needless to repeat any particulars of   the conversation  what has been said already of their different   sentiments and behaviour
