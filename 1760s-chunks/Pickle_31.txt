 despicable figure he himself made among his companions  who  far from  courting  rather shunned his conversation  and actually pined at his own  want of importance   Mr  Jennings saw and rejoiced at his mortification  which he suffered  to proceed as far as possible  without endangering his health  The child  lost all relish for diversion  loathed his food  grew pensive  solitary   and was frequently found weeping by himself  These symptoms plainly  evinced the recovery of his feelings  to which his governor thought it  now high time to make application  and therefore by little and little  altered his behaviour from the indifference he had put on  to the  appearance of more regard and attention  This produced a favourable  change in the boy  whose eyes sparkled with satisfaction one day  when  his master expressed himself  with a show of surprise  in these words    So  Perry  I find you don t want genius  when you think proper to  use it   Such encomiums kindled the spirit of emulation in his little  breast  he exerted himself with surprising alacrity  by which he soon  acquitted himself of the imputation of dullness  and obtained sundry  honorary silver pennies  as acknowledgments of his application  his  school fellows now solicited his friendship as eagerly as they had  avoided it before  and in less than a twelvemonth after his arrival   this supposed dunce was remarkable for the brightness of his parts   having in that short period learnt to read English perfectly well  made  great progress in writing  enabled himself to speak the French language  without hesitation  and acquired some knowledge in the rudiments of  the Latin tongue  The usher did not fail to transmit an account of  his proficiency to the commodore  who received it with transport  and  forthwith communicated the happy tidings to the parents   Mr  Gamaliel Pickle  who was never subject to violent emotions  heard  them with a sort of phlegmatic satisfaction  that scarce manifested  itself either in his countenance or expressions  nor did the child s  mother break forth into that rapture and admiration which might  have been expected  when she understood how much the talents of her  first born had exceeded the hope of her warmest imagination  Not but  that she professed herself well pleased with Perry s reputation   though she observed that in these commendations the truth was always  exaggerated by schoolmasters  for their own interest  and pretended to  wonder that the usher had not mingled more probability with his  praise  Trunnion was offended at her indifference and want of faith  and believing that she refined too much in her discernment  swore that  Jennings had declared the truth  and nothing but the truth  for he  himself had prophesied  from the beginning  that the boy would turn out  a credit to his family  But by this time Mrs  Pickle was blessed with  a daughter  whom she had brought into the world about six months before    6 22 15  3 45 PM   the intelligence arrived  so that her care and affection being otherwise  engrossed  the praise of Perry was the less greedily devoured  The  abatement of her fondness was an advantage to his education  which would  have been retarded  and perhaps ruined  by pernicious indulgence  and  preposterous interposition  had her love considered him as an only  child  whereas her concern being now diverted to another object   that shared  at least  one half of her affection  he was left to the  management of his preceptor  who tutored him according to his own  plan  without any let or interruption  Indeed all his sagacity and  circumspection were but barely sufficient to keep the young gentleman  in order  for now that he had won the palm of victory from his rivals in  point of scholarship  his ambition dilated  and he was seized with the  desire of subjecting the whole school by the valour of his arm  Before  he could bring his project to bear  innumerable battles were fought with  various success  every day a bloody nose and complaint were presented  against him  and his own visage commonly bore some livid marks of  obstinate contention  At length  however  he accomplished his aim  his  adversaries were subdued  his prowess acknowledged  and he obtained the  laurel in war as well is in wit  Thus triumphant  he was intoxicated  with success  his pride rose in proportion to his power and  in spite  of all the endeavours of Jennings  who practised every method he could  invent for curbing his licentious conduct  without depressing his  spirit  he contracted a large proportion of insolence  which series of  misfortunes that happened to him in the sequel could scarce effectually  tame  Nevertheless there was a fund of good nature and generosity in his  composition  and though he established a tyranny among his comrades  the  tranquility of his reign was maintained by the love rather than by the  fear of his subjects   In the midst of all this enjoyment of empire he never once violated that  respectful awe with which the
