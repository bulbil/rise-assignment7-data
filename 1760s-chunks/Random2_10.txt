afternoon  I was ordered to lay the cloth  and place two covers  which I understood was for my mistress and her niece  whom I had not as yet seen —Though I was not very dexterous at this operation  I performed it pretty well for a beginner  and when dinner was upon the table  saw my mistress approach accompanied with the young lady  whose name for the present shall be Narcissa —So much sweetness appeared in the   21 countenance and carriage of this amiable apparition  that my heart was captivated at first sight  and while dinner lasted I gazed upon her without intermission —Her age seemed to be seventeen  her stature tall  her shape unexceptionable  her hair  that fell down upon her ivory neck in ringlets  black as jet  her arched eyebrows of the same colour  her eyes piercing  yet tender  her lips of the consistence and hue of cherries  her complexion clear  delicate and healthy  her aspect noble  ingen ous and humane  and the whole so ravishingly delightful  that it was impossible for any creature  endued with sensibility  to see without admiring  and admire without loving her to excess  How often did I curse the servile station  that placed me so infinitely beneath the regard of this idol of my adoration  and how often did I bless my fate  that enabled me to enjoy daily the sight of so much perfection  When she spoke  I listened with pleasure  but when she spoke to me  my soul was thrilled with an exstasy of tumultuous joy  I was even so happy as to be the subject of their conversation  For Narcissa having observed me  said to her aunt    I see your new footman is come    Then addressing herself to me  asked  with ineffable complacency  if I was the person who had been so cruelly used by robbers  When I satisfied her in this  she expressed a desire of knowing the particulars of my fortune both before and since my being ship wrecked  Hereupon  as Mrs  Sagely had counselled me  I told her  that I had been bound apprentice to the master of a ship  contrary to my inclination  which ship had foundered at sea —that I and four more  who chanced to be on deck when she went down    22 made shift to swim to the shore  where my companions  after having overpowered me  stript me to the shirt  and left me  as they imagined  dead of the wounds I received in my own defence  Then I related the circumstances of my being found in a barn  with the inhuman treatment I met with from the country people and parson  which I perceived  drew tears from the charming creature s eyes  When I had finished my recital  my mistress said    Ma foy  le garçon est bien fait    To which opinion Narcissa assented  with a compliment to my understanding in the same language  that flattered my vanity extremely     The conversation  among other subjects  turned upon the young  Squire  whom my lady enquired after  under the title of the Savage  and was informed by her niece  that he was still in bed  repairing the fatigue of last night s debauch  and recruiting strength and spirits to undergo a foxchace to morrow morning  in company with Sir Timothy Thicket   Squire Bumper  and a great many other gentlemen of the same stamp  whom he had invited on that occasion  so that by daybreak  the whole house would be in an uproar —This was a very disagreeable piece of news to the virtuosi  who protested she would stuff her ears with cotton when she went to bed  and take a dose of opium to make her sleep the more sound  that she might not be disturbed and distracted by the clamour of the brutes   When their dinner was over  I and my fellowservants sat down to ours in the kitchen  where I understood that Sir Timothy Thicket was a wealthy knight in the neighbourhood  between whom and Narcissa a match had been projected   23 by her brother  who proposed at the same time to espouse Sir Timothy s sister  by which means  as their fortunes were pretty equal  the young ladies would be provided for  and their brothers be never the poorer  but that the ladies did not concur in the scheme  each of them entertaining a hearty contempt for the person allotted to her for a husband  by this agreement —This information begat in me a mortal aversion to Sir Timothy  whom I looked upon as my rival  and cursed in my heart for his presumption —Next morning by day break  being awaked by the noise of the hunters and hounds  I got up to view the cavalcade  and had a sight of my competitor  whose accomplishments  the estate excluded  did not seem brilliant enough to give me much uneasiness with respect to Narcissa  who  I flattered myself  was not to be won by such qualifications as he was master of  either as to person or mind —My mistress  notwithstanding her precaution  was so much disturbed by her nephew s company  that she did not rise till five o clock in the afternoon  So that I had an opportunity of examining
