 and in the manner of my refusal  I think I have insinuated this  with as much deference for Lady V——’s judgment as I could shew  She will see my motive  and I think that will be a sort of touch stone  whereby I shall discover  from her behaviour  whether my doubts are well grounded or not — Patty has  by her inquiries  heard of a little pleasant retirement in the country  about fifty miles off  where my children and I can be tolerably lodged and boarded for thirty pounds a year  at the house of an honest farmer  a relation of hers  thither I shall repair as soon as my little girls are in a condition to be removed    Continued by Patty    November 26  The dismal task is fallen upon me again  to keep an account of our melancholy days  My dear suffering lady is seized with a fever  and confined to her bed  She orders me  Madam  to write down every thing as it happens  Lord keep us  there is nothing but sorrows in this world  I am sure  at least  my poor lady has had her full share of them  Her close attendance on the children  and the loss of rest for so many nights  has brought this new affliction on her  Oh  Madam  the loss of health is a grievous thing  even when there are riches  what must it be in my lady’s circumstances  But she has the patience of Job himself  To be sure  Madam  her trials are enough to put another beside themselves  but I think my lady’s courage increases with her troubles  I was obliged  to day  with an aching heart  to dispose of a fine lace head of my lady’s  I heard her say  it cost sixty pounds  but  though it never was wet but once  I got but fifteen for it  and this  perhaps  may all go to the doctor  if my lady’s illness continues long  What does it signify  We cannot buy health too dear   November 30  My lady is better between whiles  the doctor says  her disorder is    chiefly on her spirits  and  though it is not dangerous  he is afraid it will be very tedious  Lord  what will become of us if it is   December 3  My lady has had a letter this day  from Lady V——  which she has ordered me to send you  Madam  a copy of   To Mrs Arnold   ‘You cannot imagine  my dear Mrs Arnold  how uneasy you have made me  by your not accepting of the bill I sent you  because I too well know the occasion you have for it  But  since you have refused  and I know the sincerity and strength of your resolutions  I must not take to myself the merit of this friendly and generous offer  too liberal indeed  as you  with great delicacy  hinted  for me to make  To let you into the secret at once  and that your gratitude may be directed to the proper place  it was from our noble friend Mr Faulkland that I received that sum  with instructions to send it to you  as from myself  for he well knows you would not have accepted it from him  but  since I see you are determined to reject it  as coming even from me  I think I ought  in justice to him  to place this act of friendship to the right account   ‘I had a letter lately from Mr Faulkland  wherein he tells me  that having heard  from your correspondence with Mrs Faulkland  of Lady Bidulph’s death  he fears you are by her loss  rendered extremely unhappy in your circumstances  He is not a stranger to the losses you formerly sustained in your fortune  and he says besides  he knows your brother’s warm temper so well  that he is apprehensive he will carry an unreasonable resentment he has taken up so far  as to deny you that brotherly kindness and assistance  which you have a right to expect from him  “If this be the case”  he adds  “what must be Mrs Arnold’s situation ” He then conjures me to convey to you that trifle  as he called it  under the sanction of my own name  that being the only one from which he had a hope it would not be refused  and he farther said  that if you should be prevailed upon  on account of the friendship which he knew there was between you and me  to accept of my service  he would contrive  from time to time  to furnish you with such little supplies  as might make you easy  ’till    Sir George and you should be on better terms  Now  my dear Mrs Arnold  you have the truth of this whole affair  I own it was with great reluctance I lent my name to impose on you  but  as it was so much for your benefit  I overcame my scruple   ‘I could wish your extreme nicety had not forbid you to accept this offer  I have reason to be angry with you on this account  yet my amiable  sagacious friend
